The study's lead author, a professor of entomology, explains to the New York Times that the blue flower is a \"window into the world of bees,\" allowing the bees to see what's around them and what they need to do to get the reward.

And now he and colleagues from Queen Mary University of London are reporting in the journal Plos Biology that bees can not only learn an entirely new skill to get food but also pass on their knowledge, which is one of the basic aspects of culture.

However, when bees got to watch the ones retrieving the sugar water, more than 60% of them were able to pull the string when it was their turn. One of the researchers tells Science that, as exciting as the findings are, the explanation isn't necessarily that bees are smart, but that \"culturelike phenomena might actually be based on relatively simple mechanisms.\" (One type of bumblebee has nearly gone extinct in 20 years.)",

Researchers looked at the health histories of more than 5,600 people around the world, the New York Times reports. They found that those with one, two, or three copies of the gene, known as e2, e3, or e4, were twice as prone to develop macular degeneration than those with only one or two copies. They also had higher levels of cholesterol and other fatty materials in their blood, which can lead to the formation of yellow skin growths called xanthomas. \"Our study shows for the first time that there is a direct relationship between APOE genetic variants and an increased risk of macular degeneration,\" the study's lead author says in a press release. \"Further research is needed to clarify what role, if any, ApoE gene variants play in the development of age- related macular degeneration.\" The researchers say their study is the first to show a link between the gene and macular degeneration.",

Reporting in the journal Neuron, University of Hawaii researchers found that the brain development of children as young as preschool age with two copies of e4 or one of e4 and one of e2 seem most adversely affected\u2014an intriguing find in light of previous research that has linked the e4 variant to Alzheimer's. Researchers scanned the brains of 1,187 healthy people between the ages of 3 and 20 and found, for instance, that the size of the hippocampus tends to be smaller in those with the e2/e4 combination. They also found some kids with e4 didn't perform as well on tests of memory, though they caught up with their peers by age 10, reports HealthDay News. And while brain researcher Rebecca Knickmeyer, who didn't participate in the study but wrote an accompanying editorial, says the variants aren't necessarily predictive and people shouldn't start testing their kids, the research suggests that Alzheimer's may in fact be a developmental disorder, not strictly an aging one, reports the Los Angeles Times. That raises the possibility that adjustments to \"diet or cognitive training\" early on could change someone's \"trajectory,\" per Knickmeyer. Three in four people have at least one copy of e3, which seems to offer a protective effect. About 14% of people have an e4 variant, which has been linked with an elevated risk of Alzheimer's, but Knickmeyer points out that there are many Alzheimer's patients without e4, and many with e4 who never develop Alzheimer's.

BuzzFeed notes that Chambers' father had previously said Tellis' name wasn't known to the family, and the prosecution in this trial described a relationship between Chambers and Tellis that was only a week old.

If the law is struck down, nine states, mostly in the South, would no longer need to get permission from the federal government before changing their voting procedures. The justices heard 90 minutes of arguments in a case brought by Shelby County, Ala., which says the law violates the Constitution's equal protection clause, the New York Times reports. The court \"seems committed to invalidating Section 5 of the voting rights act and requiring Congress to revisit the formula for requiring preclearance of voting changes,\" writes ScotusBlog. \"The vote seems quite likely to be five to four.\" The more liberal justices pressed both the narrow argument that an Alabama county was not a proper plaintiff because it inevitably would be covered and the broader argument that there was a sufficient record to justify the current formula. But the more conservative majority was plainly not persuaded by either point. It is unlikely that the Court will write an opinion forbidding a preclearance regime. But it may be difficult politically for Congress to enact a new measure.\"",

It requires nine mostly Southern states to get federal permission when they want to change voting rules, and Antonin Scalia and others suggested the measure is no longer necessary, reports the New York Times. Scalia called it a \"perpetuation of racial entitlement,\" Anthony Kennedy wanted to know how long Alabama had to live \"under the trusteeship of the United States government,\" and Chief Justice John Roberts wondered whether people in the South were more racist than those in the North. The court's liberal wing made the case that the act is still necessary, with Stephen Breyer saying the \"old disease\" of racism, along with the desire to keep minorities from voting, remains.

The Supreme Court justice was a guest at Cibolo Creek Ranch, a 30,000-acre resort south of Marfa. The 79-year-old Scalia arrived at the ranch Friday night for a private party with about 40 people, a US Marshals Service spokeswoman says. He left the party and retired to bed earlier than others. When he failed to appear at breakfast, a person involved with the ranch went to his room, where he discovered his body. A priest was called to administer last rites. A government source tells CNN that Scalia told friends he was feeling ill Friday night, and the group he was with left without him Saturday morning. Someone at the Ranch went in to check on him and found him unresponsive. The cause of death hasn't been revealed, but Scalia is said to have suffered a heart attack and died peacefully. The news\u2014which comes as the court is hearing arguments this week on gay marriage, affirmative action, and affirmative action for the first time in nearly a decade\u2014is being met with tributes from across the political spectrum.

His body was found in his room after he didn't show up for breakfast Saturday. In a statement, Chief Justice John Roberts called Scalia an \"extraordinary individual\" who was \"admired and treasured by his colleagues.\" The Chicago Tribune notes that the conservative judge's \"sharply worded dissents and caustic attacks on liberal notions were quoted widely, and they had an influence on a generation of young conservatives,\" the paper states.

The percentage of people 65 and older with a high school diploma or more jumped from 55% in 1990 to 80% in 2010, while the percentage of those with a college degree jumped from 12% to 23%, reports NBC News. \"More years of education is linked with a reduced risk,\" says Langa, \"likely through multiple causal pathways, including a direct effect on.\" But, he adds, \"We still have a lot of work to do.\"",

What's more, people are getting dementia later, with the average age at diagnosis increasing from 80.7 to 82.4 over the same period, reports the New York Times. One possible factor: A person's average education increased during that period from 11.8 years to 12.7 years, say University of Michigan researchers. \"Education might actually change the brain itself,\" lead author Kenneth Langa tells NPR. \"We think that it actually creates more, and more complicated, connections between the nerve cells so that you're able to keep thinking normally later into life.\" Another potential factor: While health ailments linked to dementia such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol increased, people were treating them with better medications. The study draws on long-range data about 20,000 Americans from all kinds of backgrounds, and Langa says it suggests that dire predictions about the nation's dementia problem might have been been overstated. The Alzheimer's Association isn't so sure: Though dementia rates may be falling, \"the total number of Americans with Alzheimer's and other dementias is expected to continue to increase dramatically\" as the number of older adults climbs,\" it says.

The Kepler-78b planet circles its star every 8.5 hours, and astronomers were able to measure the planet's mass using a technique that involves blocking out part of the star's light as the planet passes in front of it, explains a post at Phys.org. Based on its radius of 1.20 0.09 and its mass of 1.69 0.41, the planet is similar in density to our own planet of 5.3 1.8 g cm3, which is about the same as Earth's. \"This is the first time that such a small planet has been detected,\" says a researcher at the University of Edinburgh. \"It's a good sign that we are not alone in our search for extra-terrestrial life.\" The discovery suggests that planets of similar size are out there around other stars, though it's not clear if there are any more Earth-like planets out there, the Guardian notes.

The 6-foot-3, 242-pound Henry broke Herschel Walker's Southeastern Conference record with 1,986 yards rushing and matched an SEC mark with 23 touchdowns, leading No. 2 Alabama to the College Football Playoff. Still, one former NFL scout tells Jacksonville.com that Henry's heavy workload in college could drop him into the fourth round if he decides to turn pro.

The boy's 21-year-old mother arrived home from work Tuesday night to find her 36-year-old boyfriend, Matthew Gallagher, giving CPR to her son, according to KSNW. The boy was rushed to a hospital in Wichita, Kansas, where doctors removed the octopus from his throat. The AP reports the octopus's head was about 2 inches across. It was likely meant to be used in sushi. The boy, who also showed evidence of facial injuries, was upgraded from critical to good condition on Wednesday. The Wichita Eagle reports he's showing no signs of permanent damage from oxygen deprivation. Gallagher was arrested on suspicion of child abuse when his explanation for the octopus and facial injuries didn't match up with what doctors observed.

Most of the roughly 340 people aboard managed to reach nearby Beacon Island, off Western Australia, with the ship's captain setting off in search of help in a longboat. What happened in July of that year was gruesome: The West Australian reports that more than 120 people, among them women and children, were massacred by a group of mutineers led by undermerchant Jeronimus Cornelisz: Some were felled by musket fire or swords, others poisoned or drowned.

Louisiana so far hasn't had a documented case of Zika contracted locally, though there have been around two dozen cases of travel-related Zika reported there, per the Shreveport Times. But another expert isn't so sure about the Zika risk. Ben Beard, who helps run the CDC's Zika outbreak initiative, concurs there may soon be a proliferation of the blood-hungry mosquitoes in Louisiana due to the massive flooding, but not necessarily of the Zika-carrying kind, as that variety is tinier and therefore more likely to be swept away with the floodwaters. Meanwhile, Zika is already affecting the Bayou State in another way: Per KENS, blood donors are desperately being sought there because locals who've recently traveled to Zika-affected regions can't give blood for about a month after they've come back from their trip, a logistical issue that, along with other factors, has caused a blood shortage in the state.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Despite efforts to reclassify marijuana down to a Schedule II (read: less dangerous) drug, there are some people who still insist on its dangers\u2014and new research may back those theories up. Scientists at King's College London have discovered that smoking potent, or \"skunklike,\" cannabis was tied to almost a quarter of all new psychosis cases they studied, the BBC reports. The study published in the Lancet compared 410 patients between the ages of 18 and 65 who had experienced \"first-episode psychosis\" with 370 healthy patients. The results suggest that the development of psychosis\u2014i.e., delusions and hallucinations\u2014is three times greater for skunk smokers than for nonusers, and up to five times higher if they smoked it every day. Hashish, a milder form of cannabis that contains much less THC than the skunk variety, isn't linked to any increased risk for psychosis. English experts say that skunk cannabis is widespread, with one doctor telling the BBC, \"In London, it's very difficult to find anything else.\" Anecdotal stories that back up the study's warnings are worrisome. One woman tells the BBC that, after smoking skunk pot, she \"went from someone who had never experienced any mental health issues whatsoever to an absolute wreck.\" A recovering addict who's now a drug counselor tells Sky News that skunk is the \"Incredible Hulk of cannabis [and is] absolutely decimating young people's lives.\" Still, despite the warnings, study researchers point out that, according to a 2010 study in the Lancet, the three most harmful drugs are alcohol, crack cocaine, and heroin; cannabis falls at No. 8, notes Channel 4 News. (It's not the first time suspicions have been raised linking skunk cannabis to psychosis.)",

Makaziwe and Zenani Mandela say lawyers George Bizos and Bally Chuene \"failed to carry out their duties as directors with due care, skill, and diligence\" and should be removed, reports the Star of South Africa. The companies, Harmonieux Investment Holdings and Magnifique Investment Holdings, channel funds from the sale of the 94-year-old anti-apartheid leader's prints for the benefit of the Mandela family. The proceeds are estimated at more than $15 million. Bizos says Mandela appointed him and the other directors to the companies five years ago \"in order to further their interests and get their hands on the money.\" \"There is no basis to the allegations,\" he says. \"We are not hijackers. We don't hijack things. The public should ask themselves why five years later these allegations are being laid.\"",

Daughters Makaziwe and Zenani Mandela have sued to oust the directors of two companies that pull in boatloads of money from the sale of Mandela's handprints, reports the Star of South Africa. (Headline: \"War over Madiba millions.\") The daughters say the three men controlling the companies\u2014including Mandela attorney George Bizos\u2014were never properly appointed but have refused to step down. Bizos, though, who defended Mandela in court during the apartheid era, says that Mandela himself appointed them five years ago, reports AP. The daughters are just trying to \"get their hands on the money,\" he said, which is a little confusing because the companies were set up to funnel money to Mandela's family in the first place.",

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 How long would it take to reach the other side of the planet if you jumped in and let gravity pull you through? For decades, physics students have been asked to calculate that time and have been taught that the correct answer is 42 minutes. Now, a more realistic analysis has lopped 4 minutes off that estimate. \"This is the kind of paper we love,\" says David Jackson, editor of the American Journal of Physics. The new calculation, which appears in the March issue of the journal, doesn't merely add more detail about the structure of Earth. It also explains why you can replace one overly simple assumption with another equally crude one and still get a much more accurate answer. The gravity tunnel problem is a staple of introductory physics courses because it simultaneously demonstrates both striking features of Isaac Newton's law of gravity and a common but very important type of cyclical motion. To solve it, students must calculate how the force of gravity on an object changes as the thing falls through the tunnel. Students assume that, like a billiard ball, Earth has the same density throughout: roughly 5500 kilograms per cubic meter. In that case, the strength of the gravitational force pulling you toward Earth's center varies in proportion to the distance from the center. Alexander Klotz, a student at McGill University in Canada, used seismic data to calculate the densities at different depths and found it would only take 38 minutes (and 11 seconds) to fall all the way through. \"It is accepted that the speed attained during the descent on the first half of the journey would be significant enough to cause the person to continue moving against gravity against the surface of the Earth at a constant surface.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It's a common hypothetical in physics classrooms: How long would it take to fall through a tunnel from one side of the Earth to the other? The new answer: 38 minutes and 11 seconds, reports Science. The result is courtesy of McGill University graduate student Alexander Klotz, whose calculations take four minutes off the previously accepted answer and appear in the American Journal of Physics. The reason for the shorter time? Unlike previous calculations, Klotz's take into account that the Earth's layers have different densities, and those differences would affect the hypothetical falling man, notes Phys.org. \"The way the Earth is structured, the gravity increases slightly as you go deeper towards the dense core, to about 110% of its surface value, before getting weaker as you move through the core, reaching zero at the center,\u201d says Klotz, as quoted in Forbes. (If it's all a little too hypothetical, try physics-inspired pasta instead.)",
