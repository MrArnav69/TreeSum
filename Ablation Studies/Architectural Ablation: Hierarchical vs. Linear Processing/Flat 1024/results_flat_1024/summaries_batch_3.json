Ruth Correa, 56, has been charged with murder, murder with special circumstances, robbery, arson, and home invasion, the Hartford Courant reports. Correa has told police that she and her brother Sergio Correa went to the Lindquist home with the intention of stealing guns and drugs from Matthew Lindquist's father, who usually went to bed around 7pm. She says the plan went awry when the son panicked and backed out of the plan to make the robbery look like a robbery, according to court documents unsealed Tuesday. The documents also include texts between Matthew and the suspects before the killings. \"If u pull up street from my house and give me a stack, I'll show u right where safe is,\" Matthew allegedly texted one of the suspects hours before his parents' bodies were found. According to the documents, Ruth Correa admitted to stabbing Matthew 10 times and hitting him and his parents with a bat before setting the house on fire. A witness says Ruth Correa told him she & her brother drugged Matthew and killed him before going to the house and killing the mother and father.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 For more than four months, 21-year-old Matthew Lindquist was considered a suspect in the murders of his parents, found inside their burned-out home in Griswold, Conn., on Dec. 20. All the time, he was lying dead 1,500 feet away, a third victim of what police describe as a fake robbery turned real. According to an arrest affidavit released Tuesday, Lindquist had offered his father's guns to a man in exchange for drugs, so long as the man staged the scene to look like a burglary. That's not what happened. Now charged in the case, 23-year-old Ruth Correa reportedly told police her brother, Sergio Correa, hit Lindquist in the head with a machete after Lindquist panicked, per the Washington Post. The siblings then stabbed Lindquist, leaving his body in the woods near his parents' home, which they entered through a basement door they knew to be unlocked, per the affidavit. When Kenneth and Janet Lindquist appeared, 26-year-old Sergio hit Kenneth, 56, with a baseball bat while Ruth told Janet that \"her son had set her up,\" the affidavit states, per NBC Connecticut. The document says Sergio then choked Janet, 61, and hit her in the head with the bat before he and his sister set the house alight and took off with stolen goods and Matthew Lindquist's car, later found burned. After reportedly telling police that her brother might be planning to kill her, Ruth Correa was arrested on charges of murder, home invasion, arson, and robbery on May 12, a week after Matthew Lindquist's body was found. At the time, police said additional arrests were expected. Sergio Correa has yet to be charged, though. He's in police custody following a February arrest for probation violations and \"maintains he had nothing to do with this,\" his lawyer tells the Hartford Courant.",

The worst of it took place in a three-hour span starting around midnight Saturday when 30 people were shot, reports the Sun-Times. Of those victims, 25 were injured in five mass shootings. Police say gang violence is mostly to blame, with shooters taking advantage of large gatherings in the summer weather to inflict the most casualties. \"If they shoot you, they don\u2019t even run,\u201d one man tells the Chicago Tribune. \"They just walk away, they ain\u2019t trying to run.\" A police spokesman says the extra police presence at the music festival did not play a role in the violence because officers working it were generally on their regular days off and on OT. The violence prompted Rudy Giuliani to enter the fray with a series of tweets backing Garry McCarthy, a former Chicago police chief who hopes to unseat Mayor Rahm Emanuel. \"MAKE CHICAGO SAFE AGAIN!\" tweeted Giuliani, who worked with McCarthy in New York when Giuliani was mayor. Giuliani called McCarthy a \"policing genius\" thanks to his work with the data-centric CompStat system, adding, \"Chicago murders are direct result of one party Democratic rule for decades.\" The Washington Post can't resist pointing out that Giuliani misspelled McCarthy's first name as \"Jerry\" and the current mayor's last name as \"Emmanuel,\" and that McCarthy is a Democrat himself.",

John McCone, then the agency's director, apparently failed to tell the commission about agency plots to murder Fidel Castro (including ones involving the Mafia). So the commission never knew to ask whether Lee Harvey Oswald had Cuban comrades dead-set on retaliating against the US president. The commission famously concluded that Oswald acted alone, spawning decades of conspiracy theories involving Castro, the Mafia, the CIA, the Soviets, and even President Lyndon B. Johnson. Seems the White House nudged McCone along: He \"shared the administration\u2019s interest in avoiding disclosures about covert actions that would circumstantially implicate [the] CIA in conspiracy theories and possibly lead to calls for a tough US response against the perpetrators of the assassination,\" reads the article, which was published in a CIA internal magazine in 2013 and declassified (with 15 redactions) last fall. McCone also apparently didn't reveal that the CIA may have been communicating with Oswald before the killing, and was illegally reading his mail after he tried defecting to the Soviets in 1959.

Depressed people tended to use the Inkwell filter most often (non-depressed people preferred Valencia) and got more comments on their posts (non-depressed people got more likes). Depressed people also posted more photos of faces but had fewer faces per photo.

Now, after more than 50 years of debate, scientists say the Tully monster is, in fact, a vertebrate. The creature, which lived 308 million years ago in what is now Illinois' Mazon Creek, was first discovered in 1955 by a fossil hunter who happened to be a pipefitter for Texaco. \"I found two rocks that had cracked open from natural weathering,\" he told the Tribune in 1987. \"They held something completely different. I knew right away. Id never seen anything like it. None of the books had it. I brought it to the Field Museum to see if they could figure out what the devil it was.\" It was there that a team led by Yale University and the American Museum of Natural History used a synchrotron X-ray machine at the Argonne National Laboratory to determine the creature is indeed a vertebrate, not a problematica as had long been thought. \"If you put in a box a worm, a mollusk, an arthropod, and a fish, and you shake, then what you,\" paleontologist Victoria McCoy tells the New York Times. The Yale researchers say they were able to identify the Tullymonster's gut trace by looking at its notochord, a flexible rod in the back that makes up the backbone of the creature. \"There was no big,\" says McCoy. \"The coolest thing is finding out that as weird as it looks, it is part of a familiar group of animals.\"",

That's a big step for the creature Tully discovered when he was hunting for fossils in the Mazon Creek geological deposits southeast of Chicago in 1955. Previously the Tully monster, with its torpedo body, hammerhead-like eyes, and long proboscis filled with sharp teeth, had been categorized as \"problematica\"\u2014\"creatures that defied ready classification,\" the Chicago Tribune reports.

However, the researchers found that Tully is related to the lamprey, an \"underwater bloodsucker,\" as the Times puts it.

Starting today, you'll no longer be able to read about email, open-mike nights, or Walmart on the paper's website, and the style changes are a result of a mix-up over the spelling of \"microphone\" and the difference between an abbreviation and a short form, editor-in-chief Martin Savidge explains in a post at the Post. \"Mic is an aberration,\" he writes. \"Words like that aren't pronounced like that.\" \"For many years, I've been rooting for\u2014but stopping short of employing\u2014what is known as the singular they as the only sensible solution to English's lack of a gender-neutral third-person singular personal pronoun,\" copy editor Bill Walsh writes in a memo to staffers. \"What finally pushed me from acceptance to action on gender- neutral pronouns was the increasing visibility of gender- Neutral people.\" The move comes after numerous publications, including the Baltimore Sun and Pittsburgh City Paper, have adopted the use of \"they\" as singular pronouns for stories about people who identify as neither. They, as in \"they,\" instead of \"he,\" is the choice. It's been in use since at least the 1300s, reports Megan McArdle at Quartz. They have been used to refer to a single person or a group of people for centuries. \"There's just no good reason to embrace it,\" she writes.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Jane Austen wrote, \"To be sure, you knew no actual good of me\u2014but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love.\" But had she submitted that line to a modern English teacher, she would have gotten docked for grammar. Instead of \"when they fall in love,\" it should be \"when he falls in love,\" or perhaps the clunkier \"when he or she falls in love,\" right? That has long been the prevailing view, but after a slow and steady creep, that view seems to be disappearing. In fact, this year might be the tipping point for acceptance of the \"singular they.\" Quartz, for example, has dubbed singular they its Word of the Year. And earlier this month, the Washington Post changed its style guide to accept it, though the guide still encourages reporters to first try to write around it by recasting the sentence as plural, notes Poynter. So, \"All students must complete their homework, not Each student must complete his or her homework,\" per the guide. But when that kind of rewrite is \"impossible or hopelessly awkward,\" writers should employ the singular they. One big factor behind the shift\u2014not just at the Post but in newspapers, online posts, and English classrooms across the country\u2014is the increasing acceptance in society of those who identify as neither male nor female. The singular they solves the problem. (On a related note, the New York Times now permits \"Mx.\" as a gender-neutral honorific in place of Mr. or Ms., notes Quartz.) Grammatical purists may protest, but they are simply wrong, writes English teacher Anne Curzan at the Chronicle for Higher Education. \"There is nothing grammatically wrong with singular they other than the fact that people say there is something wrong with it,\" she writes, noting the similarity to the outdated rule, still enforced in places, about not splitting infinitives. Adds Anna Walsh at Baltimore's City Paper, \"Using language that's more accurately inclusive is something that every grammarian should be able to get behind, regardless of what pronouns they personally use.\" (The Internet seems to have invented a preposition.)",

That's according to a new study in Climatic Change that finds rising temperatures will make it harder for some planes to take off in the hottest parts of the day. The New York Times reports the study found that 10% to 30% of fully loaded planes will have to dump some weight if takeoffs aren't possible on the hottest days. \"Our results suggest that weight restriction may impose a non-trivial cost on airline and impact aviation operations around the world,\" study author Ethan Coffel says in a Columbia University press release. The problem is that air is getting thinner as it warms, and that thin air means less lift for the plane's wings, which then race along the runway. The study\u2014which looked at 20 busiest airports in the US, Europe, the Mideast, China, and south Asia\u2014predicts that by 2080, maximum daily temperatures at airports worldwide will be up 4 to 8 degrees Celsius (7.2 to 14.4 degrees Fahrenheit) by. This is only part of the problem, the study says, and heat waves will also be more common. \"This points to the unexplored risks of changing climate on aviation,\" says Coffel.",

Via Reuters, the study published in Climatic Change estimates that rising temperatures could leave up to one-third of planes grounded during heat waves in the coming decades. The problem centers around the wings\u2019 capacity for lift, which is lessened in warmer conditions. By 2100, worldwide average temperatures are expected to rise by 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit. To safely take off, airlines would need to make adjustments during the hottest part of the day, with 10% to 30% of planes affected. Full flights will either stay grounded until conditions cool down or lighten their loads by removing fuel, cargo, or passengers, per a release at EurekAlert. Think 12 to 13 people asked to leave a 160-person passenger plane. \"Our results suggest that weight restriction may impose a non-trivial cost,\" one of the study\u2019s lead authors says. Wired reports that among the airports studied, New York\u2019s LaGuardia and Washington\u2019s Reagan-National fared poorly because of short runways, as did Dubai International Airport, where extreme heat could force reduced loads up to 55% of the time during peak temperatures.

Amazon offers some employees up to $5,000 to leave, and Bezos explains that the principle is \"pretty simple\": \"Once a year, we offer to pay our associates to quit. The first year the offer is made, it\u2019s for $2,000. Then it goes up one thousand dollars a year until it reaches $5,000. The headline on the offer is 'Please Don\u2019t Take This Offer.' We hope they don\u2019t take the offer; we want them to stay. Why do we make this offer? The goal is to encourage folks to take a moment and think about what they really want. In the long-run, an employee staying somewhere they don\u2019t want to be isn\u2019t healthy for the employee or the company.\" The Tennessean fills in some gaps: The offer is good only for employees in the company's \"fulfillment centers\"\u2014the warehouses where all those online orders get packed and shipped. A spokeswoman tells the paper that only a \"small percentage of employees take the offer.\" The Huffington Post, meanwhile, notes that many of those warehouse workers are part-timers, and it's unclear whether they would qualify for the deal. Still, it's an interesting idea, writes Max Nisen at Quartz, and it shows how Bezos isn't afraid to experiment to improve his workforce.",

De Niro, who was mostly quiet during the panel, did speak up to say he agrees with Kennedy \"100%.\" Science, on the other hand, does not. Doctors, medical organizations, and the CDC say Kennedy's beliefs are unequivocally false. The director of a vaccine education center says seven studies published between 2000 and 2007 alone show that.

Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they examined the medical records of nearly 500,000 Medicare beneficiaries who visited an emergency department for an opioid prescription between 2008 and 2011. They found that patients who received an opioids prescription from an emergency medicine physician were more likely to be prescribed the drugs within 30 days of their emergency department visit than patients who got them from a physician who didn't bill for emergency department visits, reports the Los Angeles Times. The rate of \"long-term opioid use\"\u2014defined as more than 180 days of use\u2014was 10.3% higher for patients prescribed opioids than for those who received them from physicians who did not bill for ER visits. The researchers say the findings suggest that physicians should be more careful when prescribing opioids to patients with chronic pain. \"This is one more piece of the puzzle that says we need to do a better job of informing physicians and patients about the risks and benefits of these drugs,\" the study's lead author says in a press release. \"We also need to be more vigilant about who is prescribing these drugs.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Scientists trying to better understand the nation's rising opioid addictions have uncovered an interesting wrinkle: A patient's risk of getting hooked might depend on which ER doctor they happen to get. In a New England Journal of Medicine study, researchers found that patients whose ER doctors are more likely to prescribe opioids are more likely to develop an addiction compared to the patients of ER doctors who prescribe less frequently. It may sound like an obvious chain of events, but it remains unclear why two patients given the same opioid prescription after similar complaints have different addiction risks depending on their ER doc. The takeaway is \"not that high-intensity prescribers are necessarily irresponsible in prescribing opioids to certain patients,\" the lead author tells the New York Times. But \"their patients have worse outcomes that we weren\u2019t aware of before.\" After tracking 375,000 Medicare patients in ERs between 2008 and 2011, researchers found that one in every 48 patients prescribed opioids ends up using them long-term, or more than half a year. But when comparing \"high-intensity\" prescribing docs (who gave opioids to one in four patients) to \"low-intensity\" prescribers (one in 14), patients of the first group had a 30% greater risk of turning into long-time users. It may be a simple numbers game, as observed in a post at Pacific Standard: \"The more prescriptions doctors give out, the more likely they'll end up handing a script to someone who will have a serious problem later.\" But one doctor sees a larger issue: Among ER doctors, there's no consensus \"about when to prescribe opioids and what dose to give.\" (This is how long it takes to become dependent.)",

What to watch for in Trump's inaugural address: The speech itself will be the \"liftoff point of his journey in office, defining its contours and tone, and setting a course for the nation,\" the Los Angeles Times reports. \"This inaugural address will be carefully watched around the world, and the slightest little language usage could set his administration off on a very bad course,\" San Francisco State political science professor Robert Smith tells the New York Times. \"It's not clear he's capable of becoming, not a politician ... a candidate ... not a showman, but a statesman,\" Smith says. \"The whole world is watching to see if he can at least, at the inaugural address, make the transition.\" What will Trump say?

He will deliver his inaugural address at 11:51am, according to the AP's timeline, and analysts say it will be one of the most closely watched in history. Advisers say that, like many predecessors, Trump will issue a call for unity and give his vision of \"one America.\" Experts tell NBC News that Trump's unique and repetitive speaking style will drive the message home and maybe even go a little way toward unifying America. \"If I keep saying it, it becomes it,\" says New York University neuroscience professor David Poeppel. In other coverage: The Los Angeles Times reports that Trump has said he looked to the speeches of Ronald Reagan, John F. Kennedy, and Richard Nixon to prepare\u2014and of the three, Nixon might be most relevant. After winning with a minority of the popular vote in the deeply divisive 1968 election, Nixon called on the \"better angels of our nature\" in his inaugural address, saying America had heard too much inflated and bombastic rhetoric. \"We cannot learn from one another until we stop shouting at one another,\" he said. The San Francisco Chronicle lists five things to look for in Trump's address, including efforts to reassure foreign leaders. Ad-libs are also a strong possibility, though analysts say trying to wing it could be a big mistake. The speech was largely written by incoming senior White House adviser Stephen Miller, Politico reports in its guide to inaugural events, which includes viewing tips and the order of the ceremony. The Washington Post looks at the many demonstrations that will be taking place across the capital on Friday, including a few pro-Trump events, as well as numerous \"counterinaugural\" protests. The \"Let America Hear Us, Roar for Trump\" group will be sharing Dupont Circle with a pro-marijuana group that plans to hand out 4,200 joints. Time takes a look back at every Inauguration Day in US history, and at what every president had to say on the occasion. The Times of London reports on the \"security nightmare\" posed by Trump's first ride in the presidential limousine, which will take him past tens of thousands of people between the Capitol and the White House. Many will be watching to see whether he chooses to walk part of the way as predecessors including Obama did.

The mice arrived on the island via shipwrecks and sealing ships in the 1800s, wiping out two species of insect and pushing some sea birds to breed on nearby islands. A $4 million project to get rid of the mice started in 1980, and the last mouse was caught in 2010. \"I am proud to look back and see how far we've come in just 10 years,\" says the project's leader. Researchers are working on a technique called the Trojan Female Technique, which targets mitochondria, the tiny power plants inside cells, which can impair the ability of sperm to swim. Females carrying the mutations would have sterile male offspring, but their daughters would be able to breed, producing yet more. Twenty-one species of breeding seabirds, including the critically endangered Antipodean wandering albatross, nearly one in five unique to the islands, will be among the beneficiaries of the successful eradication project, says conservation minister Eugenie Sage. \"They can now thrive with mice no longer preying on.\"",

They caused a big threat to the World Heritage Site by preying on native birds, bugs, and plants, and the five-year effort to do away with them got an assist from the public, with the \"Million Mouse Project\" fundraising campaign bringing six figures. The Department of Conservation explains that cereal bait laced with rodent toxin was dropped via helicopter on the island during the winter of 2016. A team scoured the island last month looking for any mice and found none. \"This is huge news for conservation both in New Zealand and internationally,\" says New Zealand Conservation Minister Eugenie Sage. She says more than two dozen types of birds, 21 uncommon plants, and more than 150 insect species will benefit. Both Radio New Zealand and NPR note the mice originally found their way to the Antipodes either on 19th-century ships or via a shipwreck and proceeded to purge the island of at least two insect species, as well as to displace some seabirds to other islands. The initiative in the Antipodes isn't a stand-alone: The island nation has also gotten rid of other invasive species in the name of boosting biodiversity, including goats, rats, cats, rabbits, and a local meat-eating weasel. New Zealand's ultimate goal is to rid itself completely of all invasive pests by 2050, per Nature. (Scientists are bashing in the heads of invasive iguanas in Florida.)",

According to the Hollywood Reporter, Barton, 29, says mom Nuala Barton \"had absolutely no experience or training\" and simply \"[posed] as a talent manager\" in order to exploit and defraud her daughter. The lawsuit accuses Nuala of controlling Barton's earnings while only giving Barton an occasional \"allowance,\" and even of lying about her earnings for one movie \"so that she could pocket the difference\u2014on top of her hefty management fee\u2014all without Barton's knowledge.\" According to the Los Angeles Times, Barton's suit says she entered into a verbal contract with her mom when she was 8; her mom was to get 10% of her gross earnings. In 2006, when Barton was 20, she claims her mother convinced her to buy a $7.8 million home in Beverly Hills as an investment vehicle ... but that Nuala and Barton's dad now live in the home, where Barton is \"not welcome.\" There are myriad additional accusations surrounding forged signatures, a handbag line, a fashion boutique, and endorsement contracts, along with allegations of \"bullying and verbal abuse.\" As TMZ notes, the lawsuit gets decidedly personal: Barton says neither of her parents have had a job other than managing her for more than 10 years, and they both \"sit back expecting their daughter's hard work and dedication to her craft to support their lifestyle.\" Nuala is, as you might expect, no longer Barton's talent manager.

Researchers in Brazil examined 29 infants who had microcephaly, a condition in which a baby's head is underdeveloped, and found the virus in all but one of them, NBC News reports. \"We are concerned that these lesions are going to have an effect on vision as the babies get older,\" says one doctor. \"If you look at some of the images, you will see little clumps of black pigment. Those shouldn't be there.\" Researchers say the virus appears to favor neurons in the fetus' brain, though it's not clear how the virus stopped brain development at 20 weeks. The study's lead author, Dr. Bruno de Paula Freitas, tells the New York Times that the infants' brains were \"totally different\" than infants born to mothers who hadn't tested positive for Zika. The researchers say the children's eyes were also affected, with nearly 30% of them showing eye abnormalities. \"It is very difficult to measure visual function in a newborn baby,\" another doctor says. \"There is a lot of testing that not been done yet.\"",

Though it offers no definitive link between Zika and fetal abnormalities, the study does produce the first evidence of virus transmission from mother to child and \"the strongest evidence yet that the virus causes abnormally small heads and incomplete brain development,\" reports the Verge. The study centers on a 25-year-old Slovenian woman who became pregnant while volunteering in Brazil in February 2015. She developed a high fever and rash during her 13th week of pregnancy, but ultrasounds at 14 and 20 weeks showed no issues. When she returned to Slovenia in October, however, doctors found extensive brain damage in the fetus and the pregnancy was aborted, per NBC News. An autopsy found the full genome of the Zika virus exclusively in the fetus' unusually smooth and scarred brain, suggesting the virus only attacked nerve tissue, per Reuters. The mother had no family history of genetic abnormalities and the fetus tested negative for 13 other viruses known to cause birth defects. \"You have a mother who's infected, a fetus that's abnormal, and in the fetus, you have the genetic signature of the virus,\" says an infectious disease expert. \"This is clear data showing Zika can infect the fetus.\" An epidemiologist adds \"it sounds like a pretty clear case of extreme microcephaly.\" Scientists suspect brain development may have stopped around 20 weeks, leading one doctor to suggest that Zika, like other viruses linked to birth defects, may be most dangerous in the early stages of pregnancy.

The AP also spoke to a police officer who says the man is a convicted sex offender. Child protective services is reportedly looking into the father's suitability now, and Chanbua says she'd take the baby girl she carried back. As for whether she'd turn Gammy over to the couple at this point, she says, \"Never. Not in any way.\" He's currently in the hospital with a serious lung infection and will need surgery for a heart problem, reports the Guardian. A GoFundMe campaign started by a charity has raised more than $230,000 for Gammy's care, and some have argued that Gammy should be able to access Australia's health care.

Guyger lived in the same building as Jean and claimed that she thought she was entering her own unit and believed he was an intruder. On Friday, a grand jury indicted Guyger on a murder charge, CNN reports. Texas Rangers had initially arrested Guyger on a manslaughter charge. But Dallas County DA Faith Johnson said at a news conference, the grand jury settled on the more serious charge after \u201cwe presented the evidence and we explained the law.\u201d The Texas Rangers \u201cchose to file this case as manslaughter,\u201d she said, per the Star-Telegram. \u201cWe did our own investigation. We thought it was murder all along.\u201d Johnson said that murder involves causing a death \u201cintentionally and knowingly,\u201d as opposed to manslaughter, which results from recklessness. \u201cAt the moment of the shooting it was a knowing \u2026 offense,\u201d she said per CNN. Jean, who was a native of St. Lucia in the Caribbean, went to college in Arkansas before moving to Dallas to work for PriceWaterHouseCoopers. His family filed a lawsuit against the city and police department in October. (This officer was fired for not shooting someone.)",

Police say 62-year-old Tordil was taken into custody without incident in the parking lot of the Northgate Shopping Center in Bethesda, where he had been spotted walking out of a Dunkin' Donuts, Fox 5 reports. \"We had him under surveillance and he was walking from store to store and at no point was it safe to take him into custody until we did,\" says Montgomery County Police Assistant Chief Darryl McSwain. A woman was killed and three people were wounded in two shootings within an hour Friday at a mall and a shopping center in the Washington suburbs, police say. Officers responding to a report of a shooting at Westfield Montgomery Mall in Bethesda on Friday morning found three people shot. One person was shot and two others may have been shot coming to that person's aid, he says. There's no reason to believe the victims knew the shooter, he adds. About a half-hour later, police were called to a shooting in a Giant Food store in Aspen Hill, Md.

If you keep going, those symptoms will get worse.\" That's because, as the barista puts it, \"some people love it and some are broken by it, but it's all in the name of fun.\" The drink, called the Ass Kicker, is a concoction of four espresso shots, two different strengths of milk, and a turbo-powered superbrew. It's based on a version of the drink made for an emergency room nurse who needed something to keep her awake during night shifts. It took two days for her to finish it. \"We had to tone it down a bit because it kept her up for a total of three days,\" the barista says. A Johns Hopkins University researcher tells CNN that 10 grams of caffeine in one serving could kill someone. \"With much lower doses of caffeine you see the effects of caffeine intoxication,\" she says. \"Depending on an individual's sensitivity and tolerance, you would expect they might experience some negative side effects upwards of 250 milligrams.\" Still, she adds, \"If you stay within the guidelines, you're fine.\"",

Benington developed the drink after an emergency room nurse asked for something that would get her through a long shift. It comes with a warning for people with heart or blood pressure issues, and he has \"quite a detailed talk\" with anyone who orders it because \"if I can talk them out of it, they're not ready,\" he tells CNN. One area dietitian is not amused. \"Caffeine is a drug, not a game or a toy,\" she says. The author of a book espousing the benefits of caffeine also chimes in that this drink goes too far. \"I would be very wary of consuming it.\" Mashable notes that Benington does suggest people sip the drink over three to four hours to \"lift you up and keep you there.\" It also notes that a fatal dose of caffeine is generally considered to be 18 grams over one or two hours.
