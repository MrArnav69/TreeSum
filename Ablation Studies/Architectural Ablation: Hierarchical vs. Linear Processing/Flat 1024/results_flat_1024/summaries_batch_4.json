    "generated_summary": "\u2013 The Senate Finance Committee is out with a report slamming drugmaker Gilead for jacking up the price of a Hepatitis C drug by 5,000%. Sovaldi, which is currently the only FDA-approved treatment for Hepatitis C, costs $94,000 a year for a full course. The report, which reviewed more than 20,000 pages of company documents, says the price was \"always Gilead's plan to max out revenue, and that accessibility and affordability were pretty much an afterthought,\" the Washington Post reports. Sen. Charles Grassley and Sen. Ron Wyden led the investigation and released the report Tuesday. They accuse Gilead of \"arbitrary, capricious, and possibly illegal price increases.\" The report says Sovaldi's price was raised partly because Gilead expected to set a benchmark for the next generation of hepatitis C drugs, and because insurers and Medicaid programs started restricting access to Sovaldi and its competitors as demand for the treatment increased. \"This might be an example that received the most attention in some time, but it won't be the last,\" Wyden said in a statement, per Business Insider. Gilead responded to the report with a statement saying its prices are \"in line with previous standards of care.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A pharmaceutical company that has in recent years made billions of dollars on hepatitis C treatments\u2014the three the FDA has approved range from $75,000 to $94,500\u2014has been named a \"price gouger\" and \"tax dodger\" in a new report. Gilead Sciences, the sixth richest drugmaker in the world, \"is making a fortune selling essential drugs to the very government and taxpayers that helped pay to develop them, and then dodging taxes on the resulting profits,\" says Frank Clemente, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, which issued the report this month. Gilead has avoided some $10 billion in taxes by moving assets to Ireland, where there is a lower tax rate, and then not bringing some $28.5 billion in profits back into the US. Per the Washington Post, the California-based company's revenues in 2015 hit $32.6 billion, up three times from 2012. As for the accusation of gouging: Last year, a Senate investigation found that the company \"pursued [a] profit-driven strategy\" with its hepatitis drugs, rather than making the drugs more accessible at a lower price (it had considered $50,000). As the Post notes, Gilead, which declined to comment on the report, isn't alone in looking overseas for tax relief. Plenty of other pharmaceutical and technology companies do it. Apple, for instance, has squirreled away nearly $200 billion abroad, Bloomberg reported last year. According to Citizens for Tax Justice, that's enabled the company to avoid paying $59.2 billion in US taxes. Pfizer has some $193 billion abroad, per the Post. The new report singling out Gilead, the Post points out, highlights the \"simmering battle\" between President Obama and big business over the practice of sending assets to foreign countries.",

He has long been a favorite of the progressive wing of his party, though some liberals are concerned he's out of step on issues like trade and fair housing. In choosing him, Clinton \"has chosen someone who holds positions that she's spent the entire primary trying to get to the left of,\" Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus says.",

Republicans, meanwhile including RNC chief Reince Priebus, were quick to highlight the party divisions. A round-up of reactions: The Progressive Change Campaign Committee is among the groups not happy about Kaine's past support for the big trade deals criticized by Donald Trump. \"The mood of the country is a populist one,\" group co-founder Stephanie Taylor said in a statement to Politico. \"Unfortunately, since Tim Kaine voted to fast track the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Republicans now have a new opening to attack Democrats on this economic populist issue.\" Union chiefs expressed their support for Kaine, including Service Employees International Union chief Mary Kay Henry, who called him \"an experienced leader with a proven track record on issues from raising wages to immigration reform and racial justice,\" the Washington Post reports. The Trump campaign wasted no time coming up with a nickname for Kaine: It is calling him \"Corrupt Kaine,\" based on gifts he received as governor, the New York Times reports. \"It's only fitting that Hillary Clinton would select an ethically challenged insider like Tim Kaine who\u2019s personally benefited from the rigged system,\" a Trump spokesman says.

The AP spoke to convention delegates and found that Clinton supporters consider Kaine a \"solid\" choice who will appeal to a range of voters, while Sanders supporters are deeply unhappy with the choice. It \"was a horrible pick,\" says Angie Morelli, a Sanders delegate from Nevada. \"In a time when she is trying to cater to Sanders supporters, it was more catering to conservative voters and she's not going to get any wave from it.\" USA Today lists some facts about Kaine, who is fluent in Spanish and is one of just 20 people to have been a mayor, a governor and a US senator.",

Researchers looked at 32 pole-vaulting injuries that were reported to the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research between 1982 and 1998. They found that 17 of the injuries occurred when an athlete landed with his or her body on the landing pad and their head on the hard ground; eight were caused by being stranded at the height of the jump, and five were caused when the vault box was completely missed. The most common injury was to the low back, which was responsible for 16% of injuries and was followed by the hamstrings and lower leg (13.9% each), the New York Times reports. The researchers concluded that the minimum landing pad size should be increased to 20 feet, and that the rule requiring soft surfaces next to the landing pads should be enforced.",

That's the upshot of a Vice article about the sport, which succinctly expresses why: \"At 20 feet, a pole vault accident is like someone falling off the roof of their house, while running as fast at they can with a thick pole in their hands.\" If that sounds like a brush with death, it quite literally can be: A 2001 study analyzed the 32 catastrophic pole-vault injuries that were reported to the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research between 1982 and 1998; half the accidents resulted in death, and 6 in permanent disabilities. A follow-up study published in 2012 noted that one safety-related change made in 2003 was an expansion of the landing pad's minimum dimensions. In the 8 years that followed, the study noted only two of the 19 catastrophic injuries were fatal. But the rest weren't pretty: major head injuries and spine or pelvic fractures were among them. And a study of collegiate pole vaulters published this last January found 41% sustained some kind of injury, a figure that researchers saw as suggestive of the fact that \"injuries are very common in experienced vaulters.\" The injury stats aren't good, and the potential pay and fame aren't much better. So why the heck do it? Vice talked to US record-holder Brad Walker (one of 18 men to ever clear 6 meters), who sums up vaulters as \"risk-takers, usually with something to prove to themselves ... you won't find a vaulter jumping high who doesn't have at least one screw loose.\" As for why they stay with it, Vice points to its highly technical and challenging nature: As you approach the box you're a sprinter; then you're a gymnast.

The Deseret News takes a look back at the 185-year-old milestone, which the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints calls a \"series of miraculous events.\" A topic page on the LDS Church's website states that Smith was asked to \"render into his own language an entire volume of scripture amounting to more than 500 printed pages.\" So \"God prepared.\" The Mormon Tabernacle Choir's performance in Salt Lake City last week drew thousands of people to the Utah city's Temple Square.

The book, which Smith said he translated from \"reformed Egyptian\" with the stone, recounts a visit from Jesus Christ to North America, reports the Salt Lake Tribune. As for the translation, the church has this to say: \"Joseph placed ... the seer stone in a hat, pressed his face into the hat to block out extraneous light, and read aloud the English words that appeared on the instrument.\" It says the translation occurred over three months in 1829 as part of a \"a series of miraculous events.\" Indeed: In March, the Deseret News reported that the church says it takes roughly five years to translate and then produce the Book of Mormon in another language. The church says it is trying to make its history more \"tangible\" with the release, but Terryl Givens, professor of literature and religion at the University of Richmond, tells the AP that the church is also trying to show skeptics it has nothing to hide. \"Other churches' origins are concealed by the mist of history.

Maine is one of 19 states where Republicans have blocked Medicaid expansion available under the ACA. The Maine legislature has voted repeatedly to expand Medicaid only to have Gov. Paul LePage veto expansion five times. However, if expansion is approved by voters through a referendum next month, LePage would be unable to veto it. If the referendum passes, approximately 80,000 more Maine residents making up to 138% of the poverty level will be eligible for Medicaid. In addition to decreasing the number of uninsured Maine residents, supporters of the referendum say it will add jobs and help rural hospitals stay open. LePage, while attacking Maine hospitals for their support of the referendum on Friday, said it would take \"resources away from our most vulnerable Mainers\" to \"give free taxpayer-funded healthcare to adults who should be working and contributing,\" the Press Herald reports. Under the ACA, at least 90% of Medicaid expansion costs would be covered by the federal government. The other 18 states where Medicaid expansion has been blocked are carefully watching what happens in Maine. It's estimated more than 2.5 million Americans would gain access to health care if all 19 holdout states allowed Medicaid expansion.",

In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book\u2014Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\u2014has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.\u201d",

Where did it all go wrong for the Wisconsin governor? Insiders tell Politico that Walker was overconfident, and though he tried to act as his own campaign manager, he seemed to be \"making it up as he went along,\" causing plenty of strategic blunders. Fundraising dried up as Donald Trump's rise pushed him to the sidelines, leaving him with a large organization but little support. His sudden departure from the race came after he failed to make an impression at the second debate and a CNN poll found his support at well below 1%. \"He was a terrible candidate, but he also got Trump-ed,\" a source tells Politico. More: Sources tell CNN that although a super PAC supporting him had plenty of cash, Walker's campaign funds started to dry up after the first debate as donors looked elsewhere. Walker \"is a pragmatist above all else and just didn't see the path to a comeback\" after his poll numbers collapsed even in Iowa, a campaign insider says. Walker was hurt by flip-flops on issues like birthright citizenship, where he changed his position three times in a week, CNN notes, and by gaffes like suggesting he would consider building a wall along the Canadian border. In his exit speech last night, Walker said he had been \"called to lead by helping to clear the field in this race so that a positive conservative message can rise to the top of the field.\" He urged other candidates to follow his lead so a clear alternative to Trump could emerge, the Washington Post reports.

The rival campaigns didn't wait until Walker announced his exit to start trying to poach his aides and his donors, the AP reports.

The heart cells, created in the lab from skin cells, were quickly incorporated into damaged areas of the heart and helped the organ to pump more vigorously. But all of the monkeys developed unusual heart rhythms after the treatment, leading researchers to say more work is needed before the treatment can be considered safe enough for human trials. \"Currently, the only long term option for these patients is heart transplantation, but there are not enough donors to meet the current demand,\" a heart researcher says. \"Ideally, immune rejection would be eliminated if the cells could be derived from the same patient, but this is costly and time consuming at a time when the patient requires immediate treatment. Another concern is that the incomplete integration of the transplanted cells could result in irregular heart beats which can be deadly.\"",

Or at least that's the hope after scientists successfully used lab-created heart muscle cells to partially repair damaged hearts in monkeys, Live Science reports. The healthy stem cells were easily absorbed into the damaged hearts and allowed the organ to pump blood more easily. The procedure could lead to a new way to treat heart attacks and at least partially repair heart damage, the Guardian reports. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men and women in the US. Scientists are intrigued by the idea of treating damaged hearts by using a patient's own skin cells to create healthy heart cells, which are less likely to be rejected since they don't come from a donor. In the latest study in the journal Nature, the team at Shinshu University induced heart attacks in five macaques and then injected them with heart cells made from the skin of a healthy macaque who was a close genetic match. To avoid rejection, they ensured the donor monkey had a type of protein similar to the recipients' and they gave the sick monkeys anti-rejection drugs. After studying the macaques for three months, researchers found their immune systems tolerated the new cells, which replaced about 16% of the damaged heart tissue. In the end, the monkeys' heart muscles contracted better, pumping blood more efficiently. Human trials are not coming anytime soon, though, after the macaques developed irregular heartbeats. Still, doctors said the findings raise the possibility of treating damage caused by heart attacks. \"Currently, the only long term option for these patients is heart transplantation, but there are not enough donors to meet the current demand,\" heart researcher Sam Boateng told the Guardian.

The team, which worked with neuroscientists at Case Western Reserve and Cleveland Clinic, grafted nerves onto the rats' spinal cords and allowed them to regain bladder control six months after the injury, reports the BBC. \"While urinary control is complex and recovery took several months, it was clear that this primitive function lost to spinal cord injury does possess the capacity to rewire itself, even when a relatively small number of axons are regenerated,\" one of the researchers says in a press release. \"We were especially surprised and excited to discover that once a permissive environment was created, a subset of neurons situated largely within the brainstem, which play important roles in bladder function, slowly re-grew lengthy axon far down the cord.\" The team plans to trial the technique on larger animals before moving on to human trials. Meanwhile, scientists have taken a big step forward in the fight against ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease, with the successful testing of a new treatment on rats. It could be \"within three to five years\" before the disease is completely wiped out, the lead researcher says, though he notes that the rats did not regain the ability to walk.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Neuroscientists working with rats have pulled off a feat raising hopes that paralyzed people might someday be able to regain control of their bladders and ditch the catheter. The scientists grafted nerves from elsewhere in the rats' bodies to their severed spinal cords, and the rats eventually were able to pee again almost as well as healthy rats, reports Science News. The rats were not able to walk again, and while they didn't regain full control of their bladders, the study is still \"an astonishing breakthrough for the field,\" writes Liat Clark at Wired. Any similar research on humans is still years away because the results must first be replicated on animals bigger than rats, reports the BBC. Previous attempts to regenerate nerves on damaged spinal cords were stymied by scar tissue at the site of the original injury. The scientists were able to overcome that by using an enzyme to break down the scar tissue, in tandem with a growth factor that helped the transplanted nerves grow. \"This is one of the most important steps that I have seen in recent years,\u201d says an Oslo neuroscientist not involved with the study.",

Reporting in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, they say that by measuring the temperature of subjects' hands as they watched a video, they were able to tell whether the hand was warmer or colder when the water was hot or cold. \"This is the first time we've been able to show that the hand temperature responses are independent of the body temperature,\" the lead researcher says in a University of London press release. The study involved 15 healthy volunteers who were shown either warm or cold videos of their hands while simultaneously recording their own hand temperatures. The volunteers were then asked to touch the videos with their hands, and researchers found that they could actually see ice cubes in the cool videos and steam in the warm ones, Live Science reports. \"We think that this is probably because the warm videos were less potent\u2014the only cues that the water is warm was steam at the beginning of the videos and ... looking at someone's shivering hand can make you feel colder than if you were sitting in warm water,\" a researcher says, per Ars Technica. \"People seem to be capable of mimicking\u2014feel like your skin is getting a little warm?\"",

Their left hands became colder by an average of 0.4 degrees Fahrenheit, while their right hands' temperatures dropped by an average of 0.1 degrees, Real Clear Science reports. The researchers classified that temperature change as \"significant.\" Such sympathetic coldness could be an adaptive trait, says lead researcher Dr. Neil Harrison. \"Humans are profoundly social creatures, and much of humans' success results from our ability to work together in complex communities,\" he explains. \"This would be hard to do if we were not able to rapidly empathize with each other and predict one another's thoughts, feelings, and motivations.\" When the 36 subjects saw videos of people putting their hands in warm water, however, the subjects' body temperatures stayed the same\u2014perhaps because the cold was more evident than the heat in the videos, Harrison notes. The \"cold\" clips showed blocks of ice throughout, whereas the \"hot\" ones only briefly showed steam at their start. \"There is also some evidence to suggest that people may be more sensitive to others appearing cold than hot,\" he points out.

But when he opened it, he found something far more mundane: It was probably a fake, reports the Independent. The .67-ounce bottle of Macallan single malt whisky was purchased by the Chinese man at the Devil's Place Whiskey Bar in St. Moritz. Owner Sandro Bernasconi says he was \"petrified\" when he first opened the bottle, thinking the cork would fall apart or the whisky would taste bad, but the customer was happy with the taste, per the Local. He says he will refund Zhang's money if tests confirm the bottle is a fake. It's not the first time a fake Macallan has turned up. In 2002, Macallan itself bought 100 bottles that turned out to be fake, notes Wine Searcher, which calls them \"very convincing fakes.\" The fakes are \"almost worthless as a collector's item,\" a collector tells the BBC. \"What's dodgy with these bottles is that apparently, Kemp never owned Macallan and Taliker Alliance from 1878, and that nobody ever found traces of the Macallans from 1878.\"",

Eyebrows were raised about the veracity of Zhang Wei's purchase after photos were posted online of Zhang posing with the bottle and the manager of the Waldhaus Am See hotel; the Swiss hotel's Devil's Place whisky bar has a 2,500-bottle collection. The prime condition of the vintage bottle, and the wording on the label didn't add up, said doubters. They were right. The BBC reports a series of lab tests were performed and returned all-around negative results. University of Oxford researchers carbon dated the sample and say there's a 95% probability it was produced between 1970 and 1972. And it's not even a single malt, as testing by alcohol analysts Tatlock and Thomson found it was a blend of 60% malt and 40% grain. Manager Sandro Bernasconi tells the Scotsman, \"The result has been a big shock to the system, and we are delighted to have repaid our customer in full as a gesture of goodwill.\" The repayment was done in what's likely the most expensive way possible: SwissInfo.ch reports Bernasconi flew to Beijing to apologize and reimburse Zhang. The Daily Meal suspects the bottle is one of a batch of fakes that were so convincing Macallan actually purchased 100 such bottles in 2002.

Now, the 28-year-old faces up to 24 years in prison. \"It's almost dizzying when you try to make sense of it. It could literally cost me the rest of my adult life,\" Greene tells the Guardian. According to the New York Times, Greene quit her job as a reporter for KTVA in September 2014 after being charged with eight counts of \"misconduct involving a controlled substance.\" She says the charges against her are a \"modern day lynching.\" Greene, who is black, became an advocate for marijuana legalization in Alaska after meeting people who used it medicinally and being forced to buy it on the streets at gunpoint. She eventually founded the Alaska Cannabis Club, which allowed people to buy \"donations\" of marijuana. But after six undercover purchases and two raids in a five-month period, authorities charged Greene with eight felony counts of operating a business under the state's legalization law. Greene has pleaded not guilty, and her trial is expected to begin in the coming months. \u201cIt casts a cloud over every laugh and every triumph and everything that I\u2019m building and looking forward to,\u201d Greene tells KTUU.

But as the Guardian reports, her ensuing off-screen plight has been largely ignored, even though she faces more than a half-century in prison. That's because Greene, whose legal name is Charlene Egbe, isn't just a cannabis advocate but the owner of the Alaska Cannabis Club, which she created on April 20, 2014, a full six months before Alaska voted to legalize the adult use of cannabis. In other words, she was receiving \"donations\" for marijuana through club \"memberships\" before it was legal to do so. Police raided the club twice and detectives made several undercover purchases, and though Greene wasn't directly involved in them, state prosecutors are charging her because the club is registered under her name. She's pleaded not guilty to charges of \"misconduct involving a controlled substance,\" and the original indictment listed eight offenses that amounted to a possible 24 years in jail. The Guardian broke the news to Greene that six offenses have since been added, raising the total to 54 years. In the Weed Blog, Greene calls this a \"modern-day lynching,\" and tells High Times that she hopes the cannabis community rallies behind her. \"I need help more than ever,\" she says. \"Now that I could lose the rest of my life because of cannabis, it feels like the people I fought for have abandoned me.\" (Alaskans can't smoke weed in public.)",

The findings suggest that the Red Planet once had a massive ocean that covered nearly half of its surface, more than a mile deep in some places, the Guardian reports. According to a NASA press release, that ocean may have been the beginnings of lakes, streams, and rivers, which would have been a good place for alien life to begin. \"Ultimately we can conclude this idea of an ocean covering Mars, which opens the idea of Martian habitability and the possibility of alien life,\" says one of the scientists from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. The study, which looked at water molecules in Mars' atmosphere using three of the most powerful telescopes in the world, found that the amount of water lost over time must have been six times greater than previously thought. The higher the concentration of deuterium, the heavier form of water left behind, the more water there used to be on Mars.",

If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The men were both faster and more powerful, but they also became more fatigued \"much faster\" than the women. Dalton notes that in ultra-trail running, men tend to be faster, but women tend to be far less tired; in fact in Outside, one runner calls for separate goals for women. \"If ever an ultra-ultra-marathon is developed, women may likely dominate,\" Dalton says. But as for the Mars-vs.-Venus battle, Dalton jokes, \"there's no battle at all. Maybe more of a balance of the sexes.\" More seriously: \"Both sexes have valuable physical abilities and it only makes sense that we study and develop the tools to afford them the best advantage.\" (Sex gets better with age for women.)",

Qusay al-Sadr, 52, was found guilty of torture and other charges and will serve a life sentence with the possibility of parole. Prosecutors say he tortured detainees at the infamous Abu Ghraib prison. Sadr's lawyers say he was blindfolded, beaten, forced to drink his own urine, and subjected to electric shocks to his genitals. He was also tortured for refusing to admit to being a member of Saddam's Ba'ath party, according to the Telegraph, which has a video interview with Sadr.

It turned out to be a poor choice, as the young man has been unable to find a job since graduating university two years ago, despite having done very well in school. And he's applied for dozens of positions. He says he's spoken with some of the HR departments of companies he's applied with, and they told him his name was the problem, because it could cause \"suspicion.\" One recruitment expert points out that this would be a problem especially if a job requires travel abroad, during which he might get stopped by airport or border authorities: \"He might just keep getting stuck or the company has to pull him out of the sticky situation, making the hire cumbersome,\" the expert says. Hussain got his first name legally changed to Sajid, but though he got all his official documents changed to reflect his new name, his original name still poses a problem because it's listed on educational certificates, which prospective employers want to see. He's working on getting those certificates changed as well, but the process is moving slowly, the BBC reports. (Meanwhile, in America, a guy is trying to change his name to Hitler.)",

Green had participated in the arrest of two men Friday night who were suspected of conducting a drug deal inside a car. When cops blocked their vehicle, police say the men began trying to dispose of the evidence, and white powder ended up all over the inside of their car. Officers donned protective gear in collecting evidence from the scene, and accounts differ on how Green got some of the powder on his skin.
