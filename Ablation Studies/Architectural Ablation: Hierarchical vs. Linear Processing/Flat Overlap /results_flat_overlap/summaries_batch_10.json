In a series of experiments, the researchers found that bumble bees can not only learn to pull a string to retrieve a reward, but they can also learn this trick from other bees, even though they have no experience with such a task in nature. The study \"successfully challenges the notion that 'big brains' are necessary' for new skills to,\" the researchers write in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. To train 15 bumblebees to pull strings from a blue flower using their legs, researchers trained three bees in a group of three to pull an artificial flower from under a Plexiglas table with a solution that would reward them with a reward of their own. The bees then went out to forage for the flower, and when they came back to the hive, they were given the same reward and asked to pull the string. The problem is that the bees didn't get a clear sense of where the string was coming from until they pulled it back, reports the Los Angeles Times.

Out of 110 bumble bees individually introduced to the task, some tugged at the strings before eventually quitting, and only two sorted out how to pull on the string to get the sugar water. However, when bees got to watch the ones retrieving the sugar water, more than 60% of them were able to pull the string when it was their turn. One of the researchers tells Science that, as exciting as the findings are, the explanation isn't necessarily that bees are smart, but that \"culturelike phenomena might actually be based on relatively simple mechanisms.\" (One type of bumblebee has nearly gone extinct in 20 years.)",

The royal family's Christmas schedule kicked off with a traditional morning service at St. Mary Magdelene Church, on the queen's sprawling Sandringham estate in Norfolk. The huge crowds gathered outside the church got an early peek when the royals made a quick private visit to the church ahead of the services. Less than two hours later, they were back\u2014in different clothes\u2014for the Christmas service. The queen arrived first\u2014dressed in a lavender-colored coat and hat\u2014in a royal limousine, leading the way into the church. Her oldest son, Prince Charles, and his wife, Camilla, trailed behind. Prince Harry walked in with his brother William and new sister-in-law Kate. Kate, whose style is closely watched around the world and who sends any dress she wears flying off, was the first to arrive.",

Kate, in her first Christmas as Duchess of Cambridge, likely boosted the number of watchers, notes People, and impressed in an eggplant-colored coat and hat. The royals were also joined by Mike Tindall, who married the queen's granddaughter, Zara Phillips, this year. The matriarch herself stressed the importance of family in a pre-recorded Christmas address, notes the AP, though she said that family might \"not necessarily mean blood relatives, but often a description of a community.\" Members of the family were to visit Philip later today.

Researchers looked at the health histories of more than 5,600 people around the world, the New York Times reports. They found that those with one, two, or three copies of the gene, known as e2, e3, or e4, were twice as prone to develop macular degeneration than those with only one or two copies. They also had higher levels of cholesterol and other fatty materials in their blood, which can lead to the formation of yellow skin growths called xanthomas. \"Our study shows for the first time that there is a direct relationship between APOE genetic variants and an increased risk of macular degeneration,\" the study's lead author says in a press release. \"Further research is needed to clarify what role, if any, ApoE gene variants play in the development of age- related macular degeneration.\" The researchers say their study is the first to show a link between the gene and macular degeneration.",

Researchers scanned the brains of 1,187 healthy people between the ages of 3 and 20 and found, for instance, that the size of the hippocampus tends to be smaller in those with the e2/e4 combination. They also found some kids with e4 didn't perform as well on tests of memory, though they caught up with their peers by age 10, reports HealthDay News. And while brain researcher Rebecca Knickmeyer, who didn't participate in the study but wrote an accompanying editorial, says the variants aren't necessarily predictive and people shouldn't start testing their kids, the research suggests that Alzheimer's may in fact be a developmental disorder, not strictly an aging one, reports the Los Angeles Times. That raises the possibility that adjustments to \"diet or cognitive training\" early on could change someone's \"trajectory,\" per Knickmeyer. Three in four people have at least one copy of e3, which seems to offer a protective effect. About 14% of people have an e4 variant, which has been linked with an elevated risk of Alzheimer's, but Knickmeyer points out that there are many Alzheimer's patients without e4, and many with e4 who never develop Alzheimer's.

BuzzFeed notes that Chambers' father had previously said Tellis' name wasn't known to the family, and the prosecution in this trial described a relationship between Chambers and Tellis that was only a week old.

Scalia called it a \"perpetuation of racial entitlement,\" Anthony Kennedy wanted to know how long Alabama had to live \"under the trusteeship of the United States government,\" and Chief Justice John Roberts wondered whether people in the South were more racist than those in the North. The court's liberal wing made the case that the act is still necessary, with Stephen Breyer saying the \"old disease\" of racism, along with the desire to keep minorities from voting, remains.

And, of course, there will be a database featuring all sorts of cannabis strains so that users can decide which one is right for them and where they can find it. It sounds pretty high-tech, featuring \"high-res rotating imagery for every product listed\" and allowing users to search via type, flavor, or even symptom. Right now the site is in beta (\"I'm givn away 420 sneak peeks a day,\" Snoop tweeted. \"Sign up now at http://MERRYJANE.com & put 1 n the air !!\") but it will be open to the public within the next few weeks.

The Supreme Court justice was a guest at Cibolo Creek Ranch, a 30,000-acre resort south of Marfa. The 79-year-old Scalia arrived at the ranch Friday night for a private party with about 40 people, a US Marshals Service spokeswoman says. He left the party and retired to bed earlier than others. When he failed to appear at breakfast, a person involved with the ranch went to his room, where he discovered his body. A priest was called to administer last rites. A federal official says there was no evidence of foul play and that Scalia died of natural causes. Scalia had been feeling ill and didn't get up for breakfast on Saturday. \"He was an unrelenting defender of religious liberty, free speech, federalism, the constitutional separation of powers and private property rights,\" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott says in a statement, per CBS News. \"All liberty-loving Americans should be in mourning.\" If President Obama picks someone to replace Scalia, it would be the first time in more than a century that the court would be split between four conservative justices.

His body was found in his room after he didn't show up for breakfast Saturday. In a statement, Chief Justice John Roberts called Scalia an \"extraordinary individual\" who was \"admired and treasured by his colleagues.\" The Chicago Tribune notes that the conservative judge's \"sharply worded dissents and caustic attacks on liberal notions were quoted widely, and they had an influence on a generation of young conservatives,\" the paper states. Scalia's death gives President Obama the chance to get his third nominee onto the Supreme Court, CBS News reports, though that might be tough in an election year.",

What's more, people are getting dementia later, with the average age at diagnosis increasing from 80.7 to 82.4 over the same period, reports the New York Times. One possible factor: A person's average education increased during that period from 11.8 years to 12.7 years, say University of Michigan researchers. \"Education might actually change the brain itself,\" lead author Kenneth Langa tells NPR. \"We think that it actually creates more, and more complicated, connections between the nerve cells so that you're able to keep thinking normally later into life.\" Another potential factor: While health ailments linked to dementia such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol increased, people were treating them with better medications. The study draws on long-range data about 20,000 Americans from all kinds of backgrounds, and Langa says it suggests that dire predictions about the nation's dementia problem might have been been overstated. The Alzheimer's Association isn't so sure: Though dementia rates may be falling, \"the total number of Americans with Alzheimer's and other dementias is expected to continue to increase dramatically\" as the number of older adults climbs,\" it says.

Based on its radius of 1.20 0.09 and its mass of 1.69 0.41, the planet is similar in density to our own planet of 5.3 1.8 g cm3, which is about the same as Earth's. \"This is the first time that such a small planet has been detected,\" says a researcher at the University of Edinburgh. \"It's a good sign that we are not alone in our search for extra-terrestrial life.\" The discovery suggests that planets of similar size are out there around other stars, though it's not clear if there are any more Earth-like planets out there, the Guardian notes.

Louisiana so far hasn't had a documented case of Zika contracted locally, though there have been around two dozen cases of travel-related Zika reported there, per the Shreveport Times. But another expert isn't so sure about the Zika risk. Ben Beard, who helps run the CDC's Zika outbreak initiative, concurs there may soon be a proliferation of the blood-hungry mosquitoes in Louisiana due to the massive flooding, but not necessarily of the Zika-carrying kind, as that variety is tinier and therefore more likely to be swept away with the floodwaters. Meanwhile, Zika is already affecting the Bayou State in another way: Per KENS, blood donors are desperately being sought there because locals who've recently traveled to Zika-affected regions can't give blood for about a month after they've come back from their trip, a logistical issue that, along with other factors, has caused a blood shortage in the state.

The daughters of Mandela, Makaziwe and Zenani, say directors George Bizos and Bally Chuene aren't properly appointed and should be removed. Bizos says Mandela appointed him and the other directors to the companies five years ago \"in order to further their interests and get their hands on the money.\" He adds: \"There is no basis to the allegations. We are not hijackers. We don't hijack things. The public should ask themselves why five years later these allegations are being laid.\" Click for more.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Nelson Mandela is out of the hospital and recuperating at home after his latest health scare, but that doesn't mean the fight over the 94-year-old's money can't begin in earnest. Daughters Makaziwe and Zenani Mandela have sued to oust the directors of two companies that pull in boatloads of money from the sale of Mandela's handprints, reports the Star of South Africa. (Headline: \"War over Madiba millions.\") The daughters say the three men controlling the companies\u2014including Mandela attorney George Bizos\u2014were never properly appointed but have refused to step down. Bizos, though, who defended Mandela in court during the apartheid era, says that Mandela himself appointed them five years ago, reports AP. The daughters are just trying to \"get their hands on the money,\" he said, which is a little confusing because the companies were set up to funnel money to Mandela's family in the first place.",

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 How long would it take to reach the other side of the planet if you jumped in and let gravity pull you through? For decades, physics students have been asked to calculate that time and have been taught that the correct answer is 42 minutes. Now, a more realistic analysis has lopped 4 minutes off that estimate. \"This is the kind of paper we love,\" says David Jackson, editor of the American Journal of Physics. The new calculation, which appears in the March issue of the journal, doesn't merely add more detail about the structure of Earth. It also explains why you can replace one overly simple assumption with another equally crude one and still get a much more accurate answer. The gravity tunnel problem is a staple of introductory physics courses because it simultaneously demonstrates both striking features of Isaac Newton's law of gravity and a common but very important type of cyclical motion. To solve it, students must calculate how the force of gravity on an object changes as the thing falls through the tunnel. Students assume that, like a billiard ball, Earth has the same density throughout: roughly 5500 kilograms per cubic meter. In that case, the strength of the gravitational force pulling you toward Earth's center varies in proportion to the distance from the center. Alexander Klotz, a student at McGill University in Canada, says it's just 38 minutes. \"The classic problem needs to stay,\" he tells Phys.org. \"But this is a nice addition to the classic problem.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It's a common hypothetical in physics classrooms: How long would it take to fall through a tunnel from one side of the Earth to the other? The new answer: 38 minutes and 11 seconds, reports Science. The result is courtesy of McGill University graduate student Alexander Klotz, whose calculations take four minutes off the previously accepted answer and appear in the American Journal of Physics. The reason for the shorter time? Unlike previous calculations, Klotz's take into account that the Earth's layers have different densities, and those differences would affect the hypothetical falling man, notes Phys.org. \"The way the Earth is structured, the gravity increases slightly as you go deeper towards the dense core, to about 110% of its surface value, before getting weaker as you move through the core, reaching zero at the center,\u201d says Klotz, as quoted in Forbes. (If it's all a little too hypothetical, try physics-inspired pasta instead.)",
