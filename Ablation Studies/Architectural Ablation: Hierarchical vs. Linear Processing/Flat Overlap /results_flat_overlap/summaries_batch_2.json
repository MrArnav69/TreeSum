He was arrested in southern Israel after an undercover FBI agent posing as a potential suspect placed a call to a Jewish community center in Buffalo, NY. The caller claimed to have a bomb at the center and threatened to blow it up. More than 100 bomb threats were made against US and Australian Jewish institutions over the past few months. The threats were received in 33 states and most came as part of five waves. The FBI and Israeli National Police had been working on the case for months. \"We are troubled to learn that the individual suspected of making these threats against Jewish Community Centers, which play a central role in the Jewish community, as well as serve as inclusive and welcoming places for all, is reportedly Jewish,\" JCC Association of North America President and CEO Doron Krakow said in a statement, per NBC News.

Police say the teen used neighbors' internet connections, voice manipulation, and other \"advanced camouflage technologies\" to hide his identity while making threats against Jewish centers in the US, Australia, and New Zealand, the New York Times reports, via Israel Radio. However, police believe he's also responsible for hundreds of other threats around the world over two or three years, reports Haaretz. Those include threats against shopping malls and airports. In one case, he forced a Delta flight to make an emergency landing, police say. Authorities say five computers, antennas, and other equipment were seized from his residence. Per Haaretz, the teen tried to grab the gun of an officer who arrived to arrest him; he was previously found unfit for military service in Israel. Police had previously said they were searching for a single individual believed to be behind the majority of more than 100 bomb threats made against Jewish centers in the US this year. \"This is the guy we are talking about,\" Rosenfeld says. The teen appeared in court on Thursday. (Federal officials have also traced some of the bomb threats to a jilted ex-boyfriend.)",

Instead, he made it as a \"low-risk, high-reward\" gamble that would pay off in the long run, he explains to the Daily Beast. With a budget of just $200,000, Lynch became the youngest director ever to win an Oscar, for King Arthur: Legend of the Sword in 1993. He also became the first director to win best director at both the Baftas and the Razzies, and was nominated for best director for Lynch.

Paramount's Titanic made that point in 1997 by costing $200 million and earning nearly $2.2 billion worldwide. At that time, mid-budget films like Kiss the Girls and In & Out dominated the Paramount slate and drew modest profits; this year, mega-flicks like Transformers: Age of Extinction, Hercules, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles rule Paramount's roost and earn the big bucks. \"You could make movies in the ten-to-twenty-million-dollar budget range\" at one time, says Susan Seidelman, director of Desperately Seeking Susan.

The larva had burrowed into the woman's skin from something she'd brought back with her from her trip to Belize, where she had apparently been bitten by an insect. When doctors cut open the lesion, they found the larva with spines and hooks, and they were able to extract it with tweezers. The case report notes that while botfly infestations are rare in the US, they are a problem in Central America, where they're known as \"myiasis.\" If the larva hadn't been removed, it could have grown into an adult fly, which would have created a bigger hole in the skin as it grew. The woman was upset to learn of the infestation, but her skin was perfectly fine after the larva was removed with local anesthesia and a 5 millimeter incision. botfly eggs are laid on flies and mosquitoes, which in turn carry the eggs to human skin where they live for up to 128 days.

Weeks after returning home, the 36-year-old noticed an itchy spot on the left side of her groin and assumed she'd been bitten by an insect, reports Live Science. Thinking it was an infected spider bite, her doctor fruitlessly prescribed antibiotics. Dr. Enrico Camporesi of Tampa's Memorial Hospital next took a look, noticing a hole in the center of the wound, which felt hard, as though something were inside. A surgeon suspected it was a living thing, and turned out to be right. Cutting open the lesion, doctors found a tapered human botfly larva with rows of spines and hooks meant to keep it buried in the woman's skin for up to 128 days, reports the Miami Herald. Commonly found in Central America, a human botfly first deposits her eggs on an insect, like a mosquito, which carries them to human or animal hosts. Injected in skin via bites, the egg hatches into larva that eventually drops from the skin and continues developing, eventually reaching the size of a large bumblebee, per the Journal of Investigative Medicine High Impact Case Reports. Though the botfly didn't reach the pupa stage in this case, it wasn't necessary for its human host to go under the knife. Belizeans cover lesions\u2014with petroleum jelly, nail polish, and even bacon strips, per the Herald\u2014to suffocate larvae, which emerge for air and can be removed with tweezers. Still, the Florida patient was healed within a week. (Caterpillar larvae might prove useful.)",

Here's a sampling of some of the early coverage: Mitch McConnell: The Senate minority leader had the upper hand from the get-go, thanks to John Boehner's refusal to negotiate over ObamaCare. But when a bipartisan group of senators appeared to be making progress, Harry Reid shut it down and forced McConnell to forge a deal himself. \"It was not a smart play,\" McConnell tells Politico. \" It had no chance of success.\" John Boehner: The House speaker had been under fire from conservatives for months for his handling of the shutdown and the debt ceiling fight, but he was finally driven to compromise with Democrats, the New York Times finds. \"He was under tremendous pressure from the right,\" says a former aide. \"But he didn\u2019t have the luxury of saying, 'I\u2019m not going to do this anymore.' He had to say, 'Here\u2019s a deal, here\u2019s what we got, and we\u2019re going to get rid of ObamaCare,' and he got caught in the crossfire.\" Ted Cruz: His fellow Republicans were so fed up with him that they egged him on in the lead-up to the shutdown, the Daily Beast reports. \"The president gets up every day and reads the newspaper and thanks God that Ted Cruz is inthe United States Senate,\" a Republican senator reportedly told Cruz at a closed-door meeting. Read the full column here.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 During a White House meeting on Oct. 2, a day into the shutdown, John Boehner slipped out for a smoke. Barack Obama followed him, demanding a private explanation for the shutdown. \"John, what happened?\" he asked. \"I got overrun, that's what happened,\" Boehner replied. That anecdote kicks off Politico's behind-the-scenes look at the crisis. The Wall Street Journal has one too\u2014with different bits of insider gossip. Here are the most interesting tidbits from both: Obama and Harry Reid decided on their no-negotiation strategy over the summer, believing that Boehner could never unite his fractured caucus behind anything. Republicans never believed the pair would stick to it. Boehner and Reid initially struck a deal in which Boehner would pass a sequester-level budget with an ObamaCare-defunding rider that the Senate could simply strip out. Boehner assumed\u2014incorrectly\u2014that his caucus only wanted a show vote. Boehner's former chief of staff was feeding the White House intelligence, telling it that Boehner would have to fight up until the debt ceiling deadline. Reid also took to monitoring Twitter for hints on the GOP's next move\u2014a sign of how badly communication was flowing. Many Republicans turned to Joe Biden, hoping he would intervene. Biden told them he'd been \"sidelined \u2026 at the direction of the president,\" one rep says. Reid, bitter about the fiscal cliff deal Biden negotiated, had wanted him out. At one point, Boehner brought up the idea of a \"grand bargain\" at a White House meeting; Reid laughed in his face. When Paul Ryan joined the fray at an Oct. 10 meeting, he told Obama that he would \"miss his moment\" and derail his whole term if he didn't strike a deal. But he also made what White House aides called a \"Freudian slip,\" saying, \"We\u2019re going to have six weeks to negotiate the debt limit.\" That night, aides to Boehner, Cantor, and Obama began talking about a broader budget deal, and agreed to talk more in the morning. The White House never called. When Mitch McConnell finally decided he had to broker the deal, he partnered with Lamar Alexander\u2014angering Susan Collins, who had worked far harder on the process, only to see her own deal torpedoed. McConnell picked Alexander because he had better conservative credentials, and was pals with Reid confidante Chuck Schumer. Alexander and Schumer brokered the deal behind the scenes, then passed it off to Reid and McConnell. McConnell tells the Washington Post that he saw himself as a backup quarterback thrown into the game. \"I felt like I was on the two-yard line, I had a pretty weak offensive line, and the best I could hope for was to try to punt.\" Boehner made one last-ditch attempt to pass an alternative. \"We're running out of time,\" he told his caucus. \"Your 'no' vote has consequences.\" But as Reid and Obama had predicted, he couldn't convince them. With the ball back in McConnell and Reid's court, McConnell made a few last-minute demands. Reid rejected them. It took all of 15 minutes for McConnell to call back and accept Reid's terms.",

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A university has admitted to misplacing a gram of weapons-grade plutonium, and federal authorities want to fine them $8,500. Per CNN, Idaho State University has not been able to account for the bit of radioactive material since 2003 but, nonetheless, believes it was properly stored at a licensed disposal facility. However, with no documented proof, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Friday it must propose the fine. Dr. Cornelis Van der Schyf, vice president for research at the university, blamed partially completed paperwork from 15 years ago as the school tried to dispose of the plutonium. \"Unfortunately, because there was a lack of sufficient historical records to demonstrate the disposal pathway employed in 2003, the source in question had to be listed as missing,\" he said in a statement to the AP. The statement said the plutonium \"poses no direct health issue or risk to public safety.\" The plutonium was being used to develop ways to ensure nuclear waste containers weren't leaking and to find ways to detect radioactive material being illegally brought into the US following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. While the missing amount could not be used to make a nuclear bomb, it could be used to create a so-called dirty bomb to spread nuclear contamination. The university, which has 30 days to dispute the proposed fine, reported the plutonium missing on Oct. 13, according to documents released by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The agency said a school employee doing a routine inventory discovered the university could only account for 13 of its 14 plutonium sources, each weighing about the same small amount.",

Scott Stevens was a successful Ohio finance exec whose life started unraveling in 2006 after a trade show in Vegas. For six years, his gambling habit spiraled out of control: He sneaked off to gamble when his wife thought he was working, embezzled nearly $4 million from his firm, and drained his family's savings\u2014until the day in 2012 he decided to end his life. After his suicide, Stacy started researching gambling addiction (she hadn't even known about her husband's problem) and filed suit against the West Virginia casino where he was a regular, as well as the maker of the slot machines there. Experts relay how casinos track and target addicted gamblers, supply ready flows of cash via on-site ATMs, and offer plenty of perks to keep them coming back. But it's the modern-day slot machines themselves, with deceptive technology called virtual reel mapping, that seem to be designed to lull gamblers into a trance\u2014or what the industry refers to as \"continuous gaming productivity\"\u2014so they don't stop playing. While the casinos and machine manufacturers place the blame for gambling addictions on individuals, Terry Noffsinger, the lead attorney for the Stevens suit, says these addictive machines are not due to \"negligence. It's intentional.\" Stacy Stevens lost her case in West Virginia, but Noffsinger believes the movement to hold casinos accountable for addicts will gain momentum, much like how the tobacco industry eventually paid for sickening its own customers. \"The public is learning more about it,\" he says.

The court ruled that the FCC didn't have the authority to regulate ISPs like Comcast and AT&T because they weren't Title II public utilities, meaning they couldn't be forced to give preference to or block certain traffic. Here's what you need to know about the ruling and the implications for consumers and small businesses: The loss of net neutrality means that ISPs can discriminate against content they don't like. \"Think your cable CEO hates free online porn? Now you'll know for sure!\" writes Dan Nosowitz at Fast Company. ISPs can now charge content providers more for faster delivery. \"You may be in for a frustrating future.\" It's bad for small businesses. If ISPs force website owners pay for faster load times, tiny retailers and personal websites will be the ones to suffer from slower content delivery. While big sites might either get special treatment from their owners or have the means to pay in order to get placed in a bundle, smaller, independent networks won't get any notice from ISPs. Without net neutrality, your ISPs can make even more money without actually improving the Internet.",

Among their warnings: The Wall Street Journal reports that the decision could have a huge impact on sites like Netflix and YouTube, whose video services hog a lot of bandwidth (they account for 32% and 19% of peak web traffic, respectively). If ISPs start making Netflix, for instance, pay a usage fee to maintain speedy content delivery, that cost could make a serious dent in its profits\u2014or trickle down to consumers. ISPs could charge sites big fees in exchange for faster content delivery, potentially giving giants who can pay, like Amazon, a big leg up over independent retailers\u2014not to mention other small businesses, the Huffington Post notes.

The suits target a number of Colorado lawmakers, including Gov. John Hickenlooper, Revenue Department Executive Director Barbara Brohl, and Marijuana Enforcement Division Director W. Lewis Koski. They allege that by allowing for a regulated marijuana market, these lawmakers are breaking federal law, which considers the plant illegal.

Here's what people are saying: Obama is on track to have \"two horrible, terrible, awful midterm elections in a row,\" writes Stuart Rothenberg at Roll Call. Harry Truman lost a total of 83 House seats during his two midterms in 1946 and 1950, while Dwight Eisenhower lost a combined 66 House seats in the 1954 and 1958 midterms. Obama had one midterm where his party lost 63 House seats, and Democrats are expected to lose another 5 to possibly 12 House seats (or more), taking the sitting president's total midterm House loses to the 68 seat to 75 seat range. \"The answer, most obviously, is, 'Yes,'\" Rothenberg writes. \"He failed to show leadership on key issues and never successfully moved to a more diverse political center.\" The GOP is expected to keep control of the Senate, but if the party does manage a majority, it won't be for long, writes Chris Cillizza at Politico. \"We shift the ground from where it was this time\u2014seven Democrats were running in states that Obama didn't carry\u2014to an environment where seven Republican senators are running in, but they'll have to do it again in two years if they want to hang on to the majority,\" he writes.",

Consider that Democrats lost 63 seats in the 2010 midterms are expected to lose five to 12 (or maybe more) seats on Tuesday. No president has lost as many in back-to-back midterms since Harry Truman lost 83 in 1946 and 1950, writes Stuart Rothenberg. Dwight Eisenhower managed to lose a total of 66, but Obama seems on track to top him. More typical is the pattern of Bill Clinton, who lost 54 in 1994 but bounced back with a gain of five in 1998. Still, if Tuesday is shaping up to be a night of celebration for the GOP, Politico offers a reality check, at least in the Senate: Several first-term Republicans in vulnerable states will be up for re-election in 2016. So even if Republicans win a small majority this year, they might have to give it right back two years later.",

Lockheed shares, which went down 4% after an earlier Trump tweet, dived 2% in after-hours trading, while Boeing was up 0.7%. A roundup of coverage: Politico takes a close look at the implications of Trump involving himself so closely in the federal procurement process and turning it into a \"$440 billion weapon.\" Presidents including Obama have used the process to advance their agendas, but experts say it's unprecedented for one to target individual companies and contracts the way Trump is doing\u2014and his approach is likely to create great uncertainty for defense companies. Business Insider looks at the F-35's capabilities\u2014and the $379 billion contract for Lockheed to supply 2,443 of them to the military. Pentagon officials involved with the F-35 says the fifth-generation jet is far ahead of the Boeing plane, meaning it would take years of redesigning and testing for the Super Hornet to have the same capabilities. The AP reports that Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher said: \"We have committed to working with the president-elect and his administration to provide the best capability, deliverability, and affordability,\" while Lockheed declined to comment. Bloomberg reports that Trump's action \"sidelined decades of policy and practice in how the government spends billions of dollars annually on military hardware.\" A Teal Group military aircraft analyst tells Bloomberg that Trump's tweet was \"bizarre,\" especially since only the Navy uses the Super Hornet, while the Marines are \"completely dependent\" on F-35Bs and the Air Force is sticking with the F-35A. \"Thus, Trump's tweet is both late to the game and completely irrelevant.\" Retired Rear Adm. Dave Oliver tells Politico that Trump's attempt to bring the tactics of the New York real estate market to military procurement will probably just drive prices up. \"He will scare the bejesus out of some fifth-level auditor who is going to say, 'Goodness gracious, maybe I ought to look at whoever he is attacking at the moment,' says Oliver, who was a top Pentagon acquisition official in the 1990s. \"Whether the president has any legal standing of any kind in this doesn't matter.

Police believe Jones also killed Mary Simmons, 70, and Bryon Thomas, 72, in Fountain Hills, around 15 miles away from the other shootings, but their connection to him is still unclear. Jones left around 10 hours of YouTube video in which he outlines an alleged conspiracy to steal custody of his son, who's now 21 years old, the Arizona Republic reports. Ex-wife Connie Jones says Jones was a \"very emotionally disturbed person\" and she divorced him after he hit her and threatened to kill her. She was granted sole custody of their son. The AP reports that Jones says her new husband, a retired police detective, was the one who made the connection between the divorce and the shootings and told police of his suspicions.",

A lower court had already struck down a key part of California's law, but a ruling in favor of the state could open the door to similar laws in other states. Unions: If the court rules against them, public sector unions could be in big trouble, Politico reports. The case revolves around California teachers who say forcing them to pay union dues violates their First Amendment rights. Lawyers for the unions argue that they should have to get permission before collecting dues for political purposes.

So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the PCTA's Jack Haskel told the AP in 2015. But after the movie, starring Reese Witherspoon, was released in 2014, interest in the PCT exploded. \"Millions are hearing about it now and are being inspired,\" Haskel said.

Grace Rebecca Mann, a junior and leader of Feminists United, was killed in April, and her roommate, Steven Vander Briel, has been charged with first-degree murder, the Washington Post reports. Before her death, Mann had said she feared for her safety on the anonymous app, which allows users to post without revealing their names. \"Gonna tie these feminists to the radiator and grape them in the mouth,\" one post on the app read, per CNNMoney. Mann was particularly vocal about an incident in which the school's rugby team engaged in chants calling for violence against women\u2014including rape and necrophilia. Members of the rugby team mistakenly thought the group called for the college to suspend the team's members, and the group says it was subjected to more than 700 sexist, threatening Yaks in the days before Mann's death. \" knowledge, no known reports of direct threats of violence and/or sexual assault have gone unheeded,\" the university said in a statement, adding that student safety is its top priority. The school says it has \"taken significant measures so far by adding filters, pop-up warnings, reporting, and moderation within the app, and we will constantly work to enhance these measures.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A group of female students at Virginia's University of Mary Washington is lodging a Title IX complaint against the school over the anonymous messaging app Yik Yak, reports CNN. The members of the campus group Feminists United say they've received so many abusive threats online that they feel unsafe on their own campus, and they accuse the school of doing too little to protect them. Last month, one of their members was killed, allegedly by a male roommate, though authorities have made no links between the Yik Yak threats and the death of Grace Rebecca Mann. Yik Yak is popular on college campuses because it allows users within a relatively small area to post and receive anonymous messages on their phones. Members of the feminists' group say they've endured cyber-stalking and repeated threats of rape and murder, in particular after two incidents: They spoke out against allowing frats on campus because of concerns over sexual abuse, and they got the rugby team suspended over an abusive chant. (Mann's accused killer is a former rugby player.) Afterward, the Yik Yak threats came pouring in. \u201cIt created an increasing level of fear and anxiety,\u201d says attorney Lisa Banks. \u201cThey had no way to know if people who were posting messages were sitting next to them in class or walking next to them on campus.\u201d The school says it has investigated all threats of violence, and Yik Yak says it is working to curb hate speech on its service, reports the Washington Post",

Only 2012 had more, with 1,981 sightings. The provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland each saw an increase in reports over 2014, but Quebec outpaced them all, according to data from 17 sources, including Transport Canada and YouTube. The province, which typically produces 5% to 15% of all UFO reports in Canada, generated 35% of reports in 2015, reports the Canadian Press. Montreal led Canadian cities with 97 reports, followed by 78 in Toronto, and 69 in Vancouver. That doesn't mean there were that many unexplained cases; about 88% of unidentifiable objects turn out to be stars, planets, airplanes, or helicopters, Rutkowski says. Ufology Research investigates the remaining cases\u2014by visiting a site and talking to witnesses\u2014to determine if a case is \"high quality.\" About 1% to 3% of cases fall into this group, Rutkowski says. One of the perhaps not-so-high-quality ones: A resident in Sainte-Brigitte de Laval, Quebec, recalled seeing three 4-feet-tall \"humanoids\" with huge heads and \"big, black slanted eyes,\" and hearing a high-pitched hum. \"We're not saying the little grey guys are here,\" Rutkowski tells CTV News. \"This is simply what people are reporting.\" (Aliens might also have a thing for Florida.)",

George Papadopoulos, who served as a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, pleaded guilty Monday to lying to FBI agents about \"the timing, extent, and nature of his relationships and interactions with certain foreign nationals whom he understood to have close connections with senior Russian government officials,\" the Washington Post reports. According to a plea agreement filed Monday, the 30-year-old falsely told the FBI that the professor had \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton in the form of \"thousands of emails\" when in fact he had contact with the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for more than a year before joining the campaign, Politico reports. The plea agreement states Papadopolous told FBI agents \"that he was in contact with people in the Russian government during the campaign who may have information that could be of interest to the campaign.\" The plea was unsealed just as Trump took to Twitter to downplay the significance of the charges against Manafort and Rick Gates, his former campaign manager. \"Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump Campaign,\" Trump tweeted. \"But why aren't Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????\"",

Former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, 30, has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his outreach to a Russian national who promised \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton, reports CNBC. Papadopoulos initially told the FBI that this contact was a \"nothing,\" but he has since acknowledged that he knew the professor had \"substantial connections to Russian government officials,\" per the New York Times. The case is outlined in court documents here. Papadopoulos also told the FBI that his contact with the professor took place before he joined the Trump campaign, when, in fact, Papadopoulos met with the professor days after becoming an adviser, reports the Guardian. The Times calls his guilty plea, which occurred earlier this month, \"the most explicit evidence connecting the Trump campaign to the Russian government's meddling in last year's election.\" Similarly, Papadopoulos met with a woman he believed to be related to Vladimir Putin after joining the campaign, even though he told the FBI the contact occurred beforehand, reports Business Insider. \"He believed she had connections to Russian government officials; and he sought to use her Russian connections over a period of months in an effort to arrange a meeting between the campaign and Russian government officials,\" per the court filing.",

The researchers injected a compound called a sonic hedgehog pathway agonist into them just once on the day of birth, while their hedgehogs were still developing. They were able to \"completely normalize growth of the cerebellum through adulthood with that single injection,\" says the researcher. The study, published in Science Translational Medicine, was funded in part by the Down Syndrome Research and Treatment Foundation, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, and the National Institutes of Health. But the researchers say it's far from a \"cure\" for Down syndrome. \"Down syndrome is very complex, and nobody thinks there's going to be a silver bullet that normalizes cognition,\" the researcher tells Johns Hopkins.",

Scientists say they've identified a molecule that \"reverses\" the effects of Down syndrome in mice. The molecule is called sonic hedgehog pathway agonist, and it was administered to mice who were genetically altered to have characteristics akin to those of Down syndrome. The molecule, which is not approved as safe for humans, spurs a gene to make a protein tied to development. \"Most people with Down syndrome have a cerebellum that's about 60% of the normal size,\" says one of the Johns Hopkins researchers. Science World Report notes that the mice were injected on the day they were born, at which point their cerebellums hadn't fully developed. The single injection appeared to normalize the cerebellum's growth. In an added surprise, memory and learning, \"which are generally controlled by the hippocampus, not the cerebellum,\" were also positively affected. But the researcher explains that applying the treatment to humans is a tricky proposition, and could have unintended consequences, like raising cancer risk.",

The synthetic butter flavoring known as diacetyl has been linked to lung disease known as \"popcorn lung,\" and it's not just the factory workers who are exposed to it. In fact, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health had begun investigating people who worked in microwave popcorn factories who had developed bronchiolitis obliterans (a lung disease characterized by fixed airway obstruction), and the results revealed the cause of the disease was something back at the factory\u2014specifically exposure to an artificial flavoring agent: 2,3-butanedione or diacetyl. It was evident 'Popcorn lung' was a problem, with NIOSH even issuing a health alert for workers, complete with preventive steps and an exposure limit guideline. Another problem is the presence of chemicals like perfluoroalkyls, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluoro sulfonate (PFOS), which are used to line the popcorn bags to prevent grease from soaking the bag wet. On heating, these chemicals fuse into the popcorn you eat. They mess up your endocrine system, causes thyroid issues, bladder cancer, and\u2014 Consumerist reports\u2014have been found to cause lung problems in rats and gene damage in their brains.
