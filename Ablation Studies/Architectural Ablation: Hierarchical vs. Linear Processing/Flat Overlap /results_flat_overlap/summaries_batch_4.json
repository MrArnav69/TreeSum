The Senate Finance Committee investigation report out Tuesday reveals that the company knew the price would rile up the public, but it went through with the plan anyway. \"Let's not fold to advocacy pressure in 2014,\" Gilead's executive vice president for commercial operations wrote in an internal email, per the Washington Post. What the report found, per internal documents: That price seemed to deliver the right balance: value to shareholders while also not so high that insurers would \"hinder patient access to uncomfortable levels.\" But they also got more than they bargained for: an outpouring of outrage from government and private payers, and political scrutiny. \"The documents show it was always Gilead\u2019s plan to max out revenue, and that accessibility and affordability were pretty much an afterthought,\" says Sen. Ron Wyden, who co-led the investigation with Sen. Charles Grassley. In a statement, Gilead disagrees with the conclusions of the report, saying the price was \"in line with previous standards of care.\" Sovaldi is currently in a phase 3 clinical trial, but the FDA says it is safe and effective. If Sovaldi eventually hits the US market, it will be the first treatment for hepatitis C that can be used for multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. Meanwhile, Apple is sitting on a record $200 billion cash pile, and CEO Tim Cook has called for US lawmakers to allow companies to repatriate their overseas cash.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A pharmaceutical company that has in recent years made billions of dollars on hepatitis C treatments\u2014the three the FDA has approved range from $75,000 to $94,500\u2014has been named a \"price gouger\" and \"tax dodger\" in a new report. Gilead Sciences, the sixth richest drugmaker in the world, \"is making a fortune selling essential drugs to the very government and taxpayers that helped pay to develop them, and then dodging taxes on the resulting profits,\" says Frank Clemente, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, which issued the report this month. Gilead has avoided some $10 billion in taxes by moving assets to Ireland, where there is a lower tax rate, and then not bringing some $28.5 billion in profits back into the US. Per the Washington Post, the California-based company's revenues in 2015 hit $32.6 billion, up three times from 2012. As for the accusation of gouging: Last year, a Senate investigation found that the company \"pursued [a] profit-driven strategy\" with its hepatitis drugs, rather than making the drugs more accessible at a lower price (it had considered $50,000). As the Post notes, Gilead, which declined to comment on the report, isn't alone in looking overseas for tax relief. Plenty of other pharmaceutical and technology companies do it. Apple, for instance, has squirreled away nearly $200 billion abroad, Bloomberg reported last year. According to Citizens for Tax Justice, that's enabled the company to avoid paying $59.2 billion in US taxes. Pfizer has some $193 billion abroad, per the Post. The new report singling out Gilead, the Post points out, highlights the \"simmering battle\" between President Obama and big business over the practice of sending assets to foreign countries.",

Researchers looked at 32 pole-vaulting injuries that were reported to the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research between 1982 and 1998. They found that 17 of the injuries occurred when an athlete landed with his or her body on the landing pad and their head on the hard ground; eight were caused by being stranded at the height of the jump, and five were caused when the vault box was completely missed. The most common injury was to the low back, which was responsible for 16% of injuries and was followed by the hamstrings and lower leg (13.9% each), the New York Times reports. The researchers concluded that the minimum landing pad size should be increased to 20 feet, and that the rule requiring soft surfaces next to the landing pads should be enforced.",

That's the upshot of a Vice article about the sport, which succinctly expresses why: \"At 20 feet, a pole vault accident is like someone falling off the roof of their house, while running as fast at they can with a thick pole in their hands.\" If that sounds like a brush with death, it quite literally can be: A 2001 study analyzed the 32 catastrophic pole-vault injuries that were reported to the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research between 1982 and 1998; half the accidents resulted in death, and 6 in permanent disabilities. A follow-up study published in 2012 noted that one safety-related change made in 2003 was an expansion of the landing pad's minimum dimensions. In the 8 years that followed, the study noted only two of the 19 catastrophic injuries were fatal. But the rest weren't pretty: major head injuries and spine or pelvic fractures were among them. And a study of collegiate pole vaulters published this last January found 41% sustained some kind of injury, a figure that researchers saw as suggestive of the fact that \"injuries are very common in experienced vaulters.\" The injury stats aren't good, and the potential pay and fame aren't much better. So why the heck do it? Vice talked to US record-holder Brad Walker (one of 18 men to ever clear 6 meters), who sums up vaulters as \"risk-takers, usually with something to prove to themselves ... you won't find a vaulter jumping high who doesn't have at least one screw loose.\" As for why they stay with it, Vice points to its highly technical and challenging nature: As you approach the box you're a sprinter; then you're a gymnast. Walker says you need \"significant body control and spatial awareness,\" too.",

Walruses use sea ice as a sort of conveyor belt over new ocean bottom, but the ice is too deep for them to stay on the edge. Instead, they've come to shore, crowded shoulder-to-shoulder in large numbers, where they face the threat of a stampede if they're startled by a polar bear, hunter, airplane, or boat.

Walruses tend to head ashore two weeks after warm temperatures cause sea ice to recede too far north for them in the Chukchi Sea. This year, it happened earlier than ever. Walruses typically use sea ice for protection and as a home base, particularly for juveniles, while adults dive to the ocean floor for food. But \"when that ice retreats to the deeper water, they can't do that,\" Fish and Wildlife rep Andrea Medeiros tells Alaska Public Media. For the past several years, a barrier island near Point Lay has served as an alternative home base. Last year, thousands of walruses had arrived there by Oct. 7.

According to the church's website, the letter was written in 1830, three years after the first edition of the book was printed, and was addressed to Smith, a missionary who was in charge of translating the book. In the letter, Smith asks his followers to keep the book as-is, but he also asks them to keep an eye on what they're reading. Hebraisms were common in the early Mormons, a Brigham Young University professor has discovered, but they weren't until the second half of the 20th century. For example, when translating 1 Nephi 13:29, the typesetter used \"&\" instead of \"an,\" and Smith should, not \"an.\" Now, for the first time, a study in the history of the Mormon church suggests that Smith translated the book in such a way that he was able to read it in English, the Deseret News reports. The study, by scholars at the University of Utah and the Church of Mormon, builds on previous research. A seer stone believed to have been found by Smith while digging for wells in Vermont in 1822 was recently discovered in a box belonging to Smith's great-great-granddaughter. The 20-inch-wide, 5-inch-high stone is engraved with the words \"Urim and Thummim,\" which means \"two transparent stones in the form of spectacles.",

The photos have been published in a book that also includes pictures of the \"printer's manuscript\" of the Book of Mormon\u2014a handwritten copy of the original manuscript that was produced by one of Smith's scribes. The book, which Smith said he translated from \"reformed Egyptian\" with the stone, recounts a visit from Jesus Christ to North America, reports the Salt Lake Tribune. As for the translation, the church has this to say: \"Joseph placed ... the seer stone in a hat, pressed his face into the hat to block out extraneous light, and read aloud the English words that appeared on the instrument.\" It says the translation occurred over three months in 1829 as part of a \"a series of miraculous events.\" Indeed: In March, the Deseret News reported that the church says it takes roughly five years to translate and then produce the Book of Mormon in another language. The church says it is trying to make its history more \"tangible\" with the release, but Terryl Givens, professor of literature and religion at the University of Richmond, tells the AP that the church is also trying to show skeptics it has nothing to hide. \"Other churches' origins are concealed by the mist of history.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 On Nov. 7, Maine will take an unprecedented step for a state when it allows residents to vote on expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, the New York Times reports. Maine is one of 19 states where Republicans have blocked Medicaid expansion available under the ACA. The Maine legislature has voted repeatedly to expand Medicaid only to have Gov. Paul LePage veto expansion five times. However, if expansion is approved by voters through a referendum next month, LePage would be unable to veto it. If the referendum passes, approximately 80,000 more Maine residents making up to 138% of the poverty level will be eligible for Medicaid. In addition to decreasing the number of uninsured Maine residents, supporters of the referendum say it will add jobs and help rural hospitals stay open. LePage, while attacking Maine hospitals for their support of the referendum on Friday, said it would take \"resources away from our most vulnerable Mainers\" to \"give free taxpayer-funded healthcare to adults who should be working and contributing,\" the Press Herald reports. Under the ACA, at least 90% of Medicaid expansion costs would be covered by the federal government. The other 18 states where Medicaid expansion has been blocked are carefully watching what happens in Maine. It's estimated more than 2.5 million Americans would gain access to health care if all 19 holdout states allowed Medicaid expansion.",

Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book\u2014Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\u2014has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes.

Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.\u201d",

Where did it all go wrong for the Wisconsin governor? Insiders tell Politico that Walker was overconfident, and though he tried to act as his own campaign manager, he seemed to be \"making it up as he went along,\" causing plenty of strategic blunders. Fundraising dried up as Donald Trump's rise pushed him to the sidelines, leaving him with a large organization but little support. His sudden departure from the race came after he failed to make an impression at the second debate and a CNN poll found his support at well below 1%. \"He was a terrible candidate, but he also got Trump-ed,\" a source tells Politico. More: Sources tell CNN that although a super PAC supporting him had plenty of cash, Walker's campaign funds started to dry up after the first debate as donors looked elsewhere. Walker \"is a pragmatist above all else and just didn't see the path to a comeback\" after his poll numbers collapsed even in Iowa, a campaign insider says. Walker was hurt by flip-flops on issues like birthright citizenship, where he changed his position three times in a week, CNN notes, and by gaffes like suggesting he would consider building a wall along the Canadian border. In his exit speech last night, Walker said he had been \"called to lead by helping to clear the field in this race so that a positive conservative message can rise to the top of the field.\" He urged other candidates to follow his lead so a clear alternative to Trump could emerge, the Washington Post reports.

The rival campaigns didn't wait until Walker announced his exit to start trying to poach his aides and his donors, the AP reports. The competition heated up after the announcement: A source close to the billionaire Ricketts family, which had supported Walker, tells the AP that within minutes of the governor's press conference, the family received calls from six campaigns, some of them from the candidates themselves.

In a study published in Nature, researchers injected heart cells from a donor monkey into five macaques who had suffered a heart attack. The heart cells, created in the lab from skin cells, were quickly incorporated into damaged areas of the heart and helped the organ to pump more vigorously. But all of the monkeys developed unusual heart rhythms after the treatment, leading researchers to say more work is needed before the treatment can be considered safe enough for human trials. \"Currently, the only long term option for these patients is heart transplantation, but there are not enough donors to meet the current demand,\" a heart researcher says. \"Ideally, immune rejection would be eliminated if the cells could be derived from the same patient, but this is costly and time consuming at a time when the patient requires immediate treatment.\"",

Or at least that's the hope after scientists successfully used lab-created heart muscle cells to partially repair damaged hearts in monkeys, Live Science reports. The healthy stem cells were easily absorbed into the damaged hearts and allowed the organ to pump blood more easily. The procedure could lead to a new way to treat heart attacks and at least partially repair heart damage, the Guardian reports. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men and women in the US. Scientists are intrigued by the idea of treating damaged hearts by using a patient's own skin cells to create healthy heart cells, which are less likely to be rejected since they don't come from a donor. In the latest study in the journal Nature, the team at Shinshu University induced heart attacks in five macaques and then injected them with heart cells made from the skin of a healthy macaque who was a close genetic match. To avoid rejection, they ensured the donor monkey had a type of protein similar to the recipients' and they gave the sick monkeys anti-rejection drugs. After studying the macaques for three months, researchers found their immune systems tolerated the new cells, which replaced about 16% of the damaged heart tissue. In the end, the monkeys' heart muscles contracted better, pumping blood more efficiently. Human trials are not coming anytime soon, though, after the macaques developed irregular heartbeats. Still, doctors said the findings raise the possibility of treating damage caused by heart attacks. \"Currently, the only long term option for these patients is heart transplantation, but there are not enough donors to meet the current demand,\" heart researcher Sam Boateng told the Guardian.

If the treatment works in humans, he says, \"it would change their lives.\" In the study, researchers snipped out a healthy nerve bundle from between rats' ribs, graft it onto a damaged section of spinal cord, and add an enzyme that chews up scar tissue. After six months, the rats could mostly control their bladders and were able to wiggle their legs. \"Although animals did not regain the ability to walk, they did recover a remarkable measure of urinary control,\" says the lead author of the study in the Journal of Neuroscience. The rats also regained some feeling in their arms and legs. The researchers used the same technique in 2006 to restore limb control to rats with one paralyzed forepaw, and in 2011 to restore the rats' ability to breathe. \"This is one of the most important steps that I have seen in recent years,\" a neuroscientist in Stockholm tells the BBC. \"It could also restore sensation to the skin, which could help paralyzed people detect and avoid bedsores.\"",

The rats were not able to walk again, and while they didn't regain full control of their bladders, the study is still \"an astonishing breakthrough for the field,\" writes Liat Clark at Wired. Any similar research on humans is still years away because the results must first be replicated on animals bigger than rats, reports the BBC. Previous attempts to regenerate nerves on damaged spinal cords were stymied by scar tissue at the site of the original injury. The scientists were able to overcome that by using an enzyme to break down the scar tissue, in tandem with a growth factor that helped the transplanted nerves grow. \"This is one of the most important steps that I have seen in recent years,\u201d says an Oslo neuroscientist not involved with the study.",

But a new study out of University College London suggests that's not necessarily a bad thing. Reporting in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers say that subjects who watched videos of two actors holding water with either their left or right hand were more likely to be moved by the temperature of the water when the hand of the actor was warmer than that of the person holding it. \"This is the first time that such an effect has been shown on a large scale,\" the lead researcher says in a press release. The study involved measuring the thermistors in the palm of participants' hands, which allowed the researchers to determine the difference in temperature between the hands of actors playing hot and cold games, Scientific American reports. The researchers found that people's heart rates, skin temperature, and cortisol levels increase when they're feeling empathy for others. \"All home animals, including humans rigidly regulate their core body temperature through a variety of involuntary thermoregulatory responses, such as shivering and non-shivering thermogenesis, cutaneous vasomotor responses, sweating, piloerection,\" the researcher says. In another study published in Scientific Reports, researchers asked subjects to touch the skin of strangers while sitting in a room with a slightly warmer or colder temperature. The subjects' hands became less cold when they saw strangers' hands become less cold. The hypothalamus\u2014the part of the body that regulates body temperature\u2014received heat signals and directed the hands back to where people used to be when they were once cold. \"If you wished your hand was cold,\" the study says the study, according to a study.

Their left hands became colder by an average of 0.4 degrees Fahrenheit, while their right hands' temperatures dropped by an average of 0.1 degrees, Real Clear Science reports. The researchers classified that temperature change as \"significant.\" Such sympathetic coldness could be an adaptive trait, says lead researcher Dr. Neil Harrison. \"Humans are profoundly social creatures, and much of humans' success results from our ability to work together in complex communities,\" he explains. \"This would be hard to do if we were not able to rapidly empathize with each other and predict one another's thoughts, feelings, and motivations.\" When the 36 subjects saw videos of people putting their hands in warm water, however, the subjects' body temperatures stayed the same\u2014perhaps because the cold was more evident than the heat in the videos, Harrison notes. The \"cold\" clips showed blocks of ice throughout, whereas the \"hot\" ones only briefly showed steam at their start. \"There is also some evidence to suggest that people may be more sensitive to others appearing cold than hot,\" he points out.

Seattle Police Chief Kathleen O'Toole announced in 2015 that all 1,641 back-logged rape kits would be tested. The kits had to be sent to the state crime lab for testing.

Now, the 28-year-old faces up to 24 years in prison. \"It's almost dizzying when you try to make sense of it. It could literally cost me the rest of my adult life,\" Greene tells the Guardian. Greene quit her job as a reporter for KTVA in September 2014 after being charged with eight counts of \"misconduct involving a controlled substance.\" She says the charges against her are a \"modern day lynching.\" Greene, who is black, became an advocate for marijuana legalization in Alaska after meeting people who used it medicinally and being forced to buy it on the streets at gunpoint. She eventually founded the Alaska Cannabis Club, which allowed people to buy \"donations\" of marijuana. But after six undercover purchases and two raids in a five-month period, authorities charged Greene with eight felony counts of operating a business under the state's legalization law. Greene says she was never given a chance to defend her business. \"I felt like I was being singled out for,\" she says. Greene has pleaded not guilty to 10 felonies and several misdemeanors related to her club. If convicted, she could spend the next 24 years of her life in a state penitentiary. Experts say it's unlikely she'll end up in jail.",

But as the Guardian reports, her ensuing off-screen plight has been largely ignored, even though she faces more than a half-century in prison. That's because Greene, whose legal name is Charlene Egbe, isn't just a cannabis advocate but the owner of the Alaska Cannabis Club, which she created on April 20, 2014, a full six months before Alaska voted to legalize the adult use of cannabis. In other words, she was receiving \"donations\" for marijuana through club \"memberships\" before it was legal to do so. Police raided the club twice and detectives made several undercover purchases, and though Greene wasn't directly involved in them, state prosecutors are charging her because the club is registered under her name. She's pleaded not guilty to charges of \"misconduct involving a controlled substance,\" and the original indictment listed eight offenses that amounted to a possible 24 years in jail. The Guardian broke the news to Greene that six offenses have since been added, raising the total to 54 years. In the Weed Blog, Greene calls this a \"modern-day lynching,\" and tells High Times that she hopes the cannabis community rallies behind her. \"I need help more than ever,\" she says. \"Now that I could lose the rest of my life because of cannabis, it feels like the people I fought for have abandoned me.\" (Alaskans can't smoke weed in public.)",

The findings suggest that the Red Planet once had a massive ocean that covered nearly half of its surface, more than a mile deep in some places, the Guardian reports. According to a NASA press release, that ocean may have been the beginnings of lakes, streams, and rivers, which would have been a good place for alien life to begin. \"Ultimately we can conclude this idea of an ocean covering Mars, which opens the idea of Martian habitability and the possibility of alien life,\" says one of the scientists from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. The study, which looked at water molecules in Mars' atmosphere using three of the most powerful telescopes in the world, found that the amount of water lost over time must have been six times greater than previously thought. The higher the concentration of deuterium, the heavier form of water left behind, the more water there used to be on Mars.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

But as for the Mars-vs.-Venus battle, Dalton jokes, \"there's no battle at all. Maybe more of a balance of the sexes.\" More seriously: \"Both sexes have valuable physical abilities and it only makes sense that we study and develop the tools to afford them the best advantage.\" (Sex gets better with age for women.)",

It turned out to be a poor choice, as the young man has been unable to find a job since graduating university two years ago, despite having done very well in school. And he's applied for dozens of positions. He says he's spoken with some of the HR departments of companies he's applied with, and they told him his name was the problem, because it could cause \"suspicion.\" One recruitment expert points out that this would be a problem especially if a job requires travel abroad, during which he might get stopped by airport or border authorities: \"He might just keep getting stuck or the company has to pull him out of the sticky situation, making the hire cumbersome,\" the expert says. Hussain got his first name legally changed to Sajid, but though he got all his official documents changed to reflect his new name, his original name still poses a problem because it's listed on educational certificates, which prospective employers want to see.

An hour later, Green passed out at the station from overdosing on the white powder that police think was fentanyl.

Green had participated in the arrest of two men Friday night who were suspected of conducting a drug deal inside a car. When cops blocked their vehicle, police say the men began trying to dispose of the evidence, and white powder ended up all over the inside of their car. Officers donned protective gear in collecting evidence from the scene, and accounts differ on how Green got some of the powder on his skin. The best guess is that some ended up on his shirt and he wiped it off with his bare hand, reports WKBN. \"Just out of instinct, he tried to brush it off\u2014not thinking,\" says a police captain.
