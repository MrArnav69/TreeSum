Cardiotrophin acts as a \"relaxation agent\" for the heart, helping it to pump blood more easily and to repair damaged tissue, the researchers say in a press release. It also appears to be an effective treatment for heart failure, which is the second leading cause of death in the US, according to the American Heart Association. The study's lead author, Dr. Lynn Megeney, tells the CBC that it's the first time a heart disease-related stem cell has been shown to be effective in repairing the damage done to the heart by an attack. He says the next step will be to test it on people who have had heart attacks or strokes to see if it works the same way in them. (Click to read about another potentially life-saving discovery.)",

According to a study in Cell Research, the Ottawa researchers discovered that protein cardiotrophin 1 (CT1) can fuel healthy heart growth, repair heart damage, and cause the heart to pump more blood in cases of left heart failure, as a result of heart attack, and right heart failure, as a result of high blood pressure in the lungs, reports Medical News Today. It's a big deal since medications used to treat left heart failure don't work on right heart failure, which usually requires a heart transplant, per a release. Exercise can be beneficial because it boosts the heart's ability to pump blood, but \"people with heart failure usually can't exercise,\" researcher Lynn Megeney tells the Ottawa Citizen. The heart usually responds by expanding, irreversibly, in an unhealthy way. But that's why CT1 is \"very exciting,\" Megeney says. It \"causes heart muscles to grow in a more healthy way and it also stimulates blood vessel growth in the heart,\" increasing blood flow just like with exercise. And just like with exercise, the heart returns to its original size afterward. Megeney says the discovery could lead to fewer heart transplants, but he says it could be two or three years before researchers begin clinical trials on humans and, assuming they go well, a decade before treatment is available to the public.

Not only does the deal give Microsoft access to Nokia's patents, but it gives Microsoft a real shot in the arm as it looks to take on Apple and Google in the smartphone market. \"The Nokia acquisition will instantly put Microsoft in a much stronger position to compete in the high-end smartphone market.\" Winkler calls the deal a \"watershed\" one for both companies. \"Nokia's miscalculations became impossible to ignore in 2008, the same year Microsoft decided, internally at least, to scrap its ancient and inadequate Windows Mobile platform in favor of something entirely new,\" he writes. \"It felt like a radical about-face, but no matter: Nokia and Microsoft were going to save each other.

But with the new Airbus A350 XWB, the first aircraft to land in the US last week, the airline says it has come up with a solution, Wired reports. \"The design process was about optimization, pushing the constraints, and opening up the box of solutions,\" says Alain De Zotti, chief engineer of the plane's program. Among the improvements: bigger wings (about 20% bigger than previous generations of planes), wider seats (about 10% wider), and LED lights that change color to mimic the sun's natural glow. The filtering system changes the air in the plane every two to three minutes to keep air from stale, and the cabin is pressurized to 6,000 feet, which makes it easier for passengers to move down the aisles. The A350 also comes with more room for larger passenger seats in economy class, just an extra inch over the standard width. \"Business class is now like first class was, and first class is like little apartments,\" DeZotti says. The plane is also lighter, with more than 50% of the structure made from carbon fiber-reinforced plastic, which is less susceptible to corrosion than aluminum, Wired notes.

Another factor: Because of the planes' relatively light frames, they can be pressurized to 6,000 feet, which the airline says allows for more humidity and makes the air pressure inside the aircraft closer to the pressure on the ground than is the case with most jets, per Quartz. A third factor is the jet's filtration system, which replaces the air in the cabin in its entirety every two to three minutes. The idea there is that, if nothing else, the improved air quality should help people sleep better on long flights. And the big question: Has it worked? It's a little too early to tell.

Austin's story made headlines, especially due to the fact that Cainan was the first baby born in Concord, NH, in 2017. \"If I have to choose between work and family, I\u2019m always going to pick my family,\" Austin told the Monitor shortly after his son's birth. Since then, people have been stepping up to help Austin, a 30-year-old military veteran and father of four, big-time. He's gotten offers for at least three jobs, plus money raised for him on a GoFundMe page set up by a mother who was upset by what happened to Austin\u2014even though, as experts explain to the Concord Monitor, it's perfectly legal in an \"at-will\" employment state such as New Hampshire. In a statement reported by WCVB, Anthony Salerno Jr. cited confidentiality in not commenting on the particulars of the situation, but did say \"SPS is not in the practice of releasing employees for reasons stated in the article published in the monitor [sic] but must be cognizant of the product we give our clients!\" But there's no bad blood, Austin tells the Monitor. \"[Salerno] had his company, which is like his baby, and I had my baby ... Naturally, he\u2019s going to pick his baby over my baby. I can't blame him for that.\" (This waitress lost her job for firing a shot at robbers.)",

They found that the pathway that produces vitamin B 12 was altered, and this changed the bacteria's gene expression, which could have led to acne-promoting inflammation. They then studied the skin of people who received a B12 injection, and found that one of the 10 participants broke out in pimples a week after receiving the injection. That person's P. acnes gene-expression pattern also changed, the researchers found. \"This study does present some compelling evidence suggesting that supplementation with B12 can cause or exacerbate acne in a subset of individuals,\" says one dermatology professor.

Twice in her seven years, Ellie Henegar\u2019s life was saved with an EpiPen, but her parents were stunned last year when the bill came to $600, they told CBS. Compare that to 2009, when the bill was about $100 for the same two-pack of EpiPen. While insurance covers varying degrees of the cost, not everyone is lucky enough to have a plan that does, NBC notes. With a near monopoly, Mylan has little incentive to cut the price, Bloomberg reports. In fact, Mylan execs considered dumping the aging product in 2007. Instead, they launched a marketing campaign that turned the device into an essential, donating EpiPens to schools and dropping $35 million on TV ads. A law passed by Congress in 2013 requiring schools to stock epinephrine devices also boosted sales, which last year totaled $1 billion. Mylan contends it has made a \"significant investment\" to improve the device and offers coupons. \"It's a totally established brand name with little competition,\" Bloomberg\u2019s Robert Langreth tells CBS. \"That gives them freedom to raise the price every year.\"",

The BBC reports respectful behavior by officers included apologizing, showing an interest in the person, and saying \"drive safely.\" Disrespectful behavior included asking questions, calling the person \"bro\" or \"man,\" and using words that have a negative connotation. The study found officers were 57% more likely to use one of the most respectful phrases with white people and 61% more likely to use one of the most disrespectful phrases with black people. For example, white people were more likely to be called \"sir\" or \"ma'am,\" while black people were more likely to be called by their first names. Officers were also found to be less polite, formal, friendly, and impartial with black people.

The study, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, looked at the health records of nearly 4,000 women over a 20-year period. The women were split into three groups: Those who used talc products (including products containing asbestos-free talc), those who didn't use them, and those who used talcum powder. The researchers found no difference in cancer rates between the groups, though there was a noticeable increase in the rate of ovarian cancer among women who used the powder. talc, which is also used in feminine products such as tampons and sanitary napkins, was found to have asbestos in its natural form, which miners may have been exposed to while working underground. However, all talc products used in the US since the 1970s, including baby powder and facial powders, have been asbestos- free, the American Journal of Cancer Research notes. \"The results of this study do not demonstrate a cause-and-effect relationship between the use of talcum powder and cancer,\" a rep for Johnson & Johnson says in a statement.

As earlier reported, 14 Democratic senators backed fast track in a late May vote, and 13 did so today. The timeline, per the Hill: After the fast-track vote, the Senate will vote on a package that includes Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA)\u2014a measure that would provide job training and other help to people who lose their jobs because of the trade deal. Democrats have insisted TAA be paired with the fast track; some on the other side of the aisle oppose it. The House will then need to vote on it, and both Mitch McConnell and John Boehner have pledged to make TAA law. As Politico puts it, today's vote \"came as Democrats wavered on whether to trust\" them to do so.",

Researchers looked at data going back to 1979 and found that 58.3% of newborns were circumcised in 2010, down from 64.5% in 1979 and the lowest rate since the report's inception, reports the New York Times. While the American Academy of Pediatrics still recommends that male newborns be circumcised, the CDC report notes that \"circumcision rates fluctuated during this period, generally declining during the 1980s, rising in the 1990s, and declining again in the early years of the 21st century.\" The biggest drops were seen in the Midwest (from 82.9% in 1998 to 68.8% in 2009) and South (from 53.8% in 1988 to 66.1% in 1995), while the West saw a 37% decrease from 63.9% in 1979 to 40.2% in 2010. The lead author of the report, which was published in the Journal of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, tells the Times that while there's no evidence that male circumcision leads to increased risk of circumcision-related diseases such as herpes and urinary tract infections, \"there is some evidence that it does increase the risk of these diseases.\" In Denmark, meanwhile, a new poll finds that 74% of respondents want a full or partial ban on male circumcision.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 \"To be circumcised should be an informed, personal choice,\" or so thinks the Danish Medical Association, which on Friday issued its recommendation that no boy under age 18 in the country be circumcised.

That's not to say the doctors' group is calling for a ban, which it says it weighed and decided against due to cases where male circumcision is medically necessary and for the potential for clandestine botched procedures, says Moller. Had they wanted a ban, they'd possibly face a steep slope. In a June report to the UN, Denmark agreed with Egypt's stance that it is a parental right to circumcise one's male child, reports the Copenhagen Post. Still, the Local reports that 74% of respondents to a 2014 survey said they'd support a full or partial ban. An estimated 1,000 to 2,000 circumcisions take place in Denmark each year, and the country should have a firmer idea of that number as of Jan. 1, after which all circumcisions must be logged in Denmark's national patient registry, reports the Local. Doctors who fail to do so will be fined, reports the Post. The CDC reports that in 2010, an estimated 58% of male newborns were circumcised in the US.

After Mohawk pounced on the bystander, the rangers felt they couldn't wait for a second team on its way with tranqs\u2014so they unleashed what the Star says was nine bullets, leaving the animal \"roaring and writhing in pain\" as he died. \"If the rangers had the right equipment, this lion would not have died,\" a local resident tells the paper. \"You can't keep a lion in the midst of people for so many hours without stressing it. We blame them for this heinous act.\" The shooting has prompted plenty of backlash on social media, including a #JusticeForMohawk hashtag, but the wildlife service says it had no choice once the lion started attacking humans. \"This action was taken as a last resort after an escalation of the situation and a concern for public safety,\" the Kenya Wildlife Service says, per CNN.

In the century since, African-Americans have become a much more feared and respected group, and their physical well-being has become a major concern for society. \"One is that 100 years later African-American are considered human beings whose physicalwell-being concerns society (at least in theory) as much as that of Caucasians,\" writes John Aravosis at Slate. \"The other change is that, even taking into account Taylor's subjects were all experienced manual laborers, people must have had much stronger backs back then.\"",

In this week's Morbidity and Mortality report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention review his death, the first \"linked to marijuana consumption without evidence of polysubstance use\" since pot became legal in the state in 2012. (The lemon poppyseed cookie was purchased legally by a 23-year-old friend; Thamba, however, wasn't of age and therefore didn't consume the pot legally.) The police report stated he initially ate just the recommended single portion of the cookie; some 30-60 minutes later, still feeling no effects, Thamba\u2014called \"marijuana naive, with no known history of alcohol abuse, illicit drug use, or mental illness\"\u2014ate the whole cookie, constituting 6.5 servings. Roughly 2.5 hours later, Thamba exhibited \"hostile behavior,\" according to his friends. He had no other drugs in his system at the time he jumped, and his death was ruled an accident. The legal blood limit for THC for drivers in the state is 5.0 ng/mL; his blood level was 49 ng/mL. LiveScience reports that regulations were put in place in February regarding the labeling of edible marijuana items; if they contain more than 10 mg of THC, each 10 mg serving must be clearly indicated. The cookie Thamba ate contained 65 mg. (Thamba's friends reportedly tried to calm him.)",

His heirs say some of the paintings by Max Beckmann, Juan Gris, and Paul Klee were stolen from him and may have been sold by Nazi art dealer Hildebrand Gurlitt, who was allowed to sell works deemed to be \"degenerate.\" The lawsuit, filed in New York on Monday, accuses Bavaria and the Bayerische Staatsgemaldesammlungen (Bavarian State Paintings Collections) of violating international law by refusing to return the paintings. \"The state-level program of Aryanizing Jewish businesses made the confiscation possible,\" the lawsuit's lawyer says. The paintings are currently on display at Munich's Pinakothek der Moderne museum, despite the museum's commitment to \"fair and just\" treatment for Nazi-looted art.

And so in the case of the six paintings by Max Beckmann and two others by Juan Gris and Paul Klee, timing is the issue. The Bavarian State Paintings Collection argues the paintings, worth up to $20 million, were sold by Flechtheim in 1932.

This is consistent with other galaxies that formed within a billion years of the BigBang. \"The most reliable way to select galaxies is to use the color because the further out you go in the universe, galaxies get redder and redder,\" a UC Riverside astronomer tells CBS. \"So, that is an indication of the distance.\" At 13.1 billion light years from Earth, it's about 30 billion light-years from us\u2014far enough away that astronomers were able to measure how far it was from us by analyzing its color, the BBC reports. \"This is the most far-flung galaxy we've confirmed,\" says the lead researcher. \"We are seeing this galaxy as it was 700 million year after theBig Bang.\" The galaxies themselves would be filled with the newly formed, massive stars, many of which could be a thousand times the mass of our own sun, says Casey Papovich, one of the lead authors of the study in Nature.
