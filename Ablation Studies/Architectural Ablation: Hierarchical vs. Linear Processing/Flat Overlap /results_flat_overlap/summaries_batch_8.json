The lawsuit will also claim Lockleer verbally abused the EMT and tried to put her on a gurney, and that she was \"deprived of her enjoyment of life\" and \"unable to work as a paramedic due to the physical, mental, and emotional injuries caused by and resulting from the defendant's assault and battery of the plaintiff,\" per the Hollywood Reporter.

The bill strategy calls for capping overall greenhouse-gas emissions, but would allow companies to buy and trade permits allowing certain amounts of emissions. President Obama is working with Senate leaders to get the bill through as quickly as possible, said a White House spokesman. The delay, however, has raised fears that the Senate may end up putting off debating the bill for as long as 2011 to avoid holding a vote just before next year's midterm elections. \"There would be nothing better than for us to talk about over the summer than Democrats pushing a huge new energy tax,\u201d one Republican leadership aide told The Hill.",

It isn't clear whether Manafort actually received the cash, which investigators say is linked to a network that also bribed election officials. Manafort's lawyer says his client never received the payments and any suspicions are \"probably heavily politically tinged.\" In other coverage: The Hill reports that there doesn't appear to be any love lost between Manafort and former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski: Lewandowski, who was fired after clashing with Manafort, tweeted a link to the NYT Ukraine story minutes after it first appeared. The AP reports that Trump plans to deliver a major foreign policy speech in Ohio Monday that will focus on \"realism,\" with policies including destroying ISIS without engaging in \"nation-building\"\u2014and on new ideological tests for people seeking to enter the US. Politico reports that Trump targeted the media in a series of tweets Sunday, claiming that he would be beating Hillary Clinton by 20% if the \"disgusting\" media covered him honestly. \"I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process,\" he tweeted. \"It is not 'freedom of the press' when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!\" he added. The Wall Street Journal editorial board warned Sunday that Trump's \"window for a turnaround\" is closing and his GOP supporters now face a \"moment of truth\" before he is written off as a lost cause. \"The tragedy is that this is happening in a year when Republicans should win,\" they write.",

Looking at 725 adult children from 309 families in the Within-Family Differences Study\u2014a longitudinal project documenting various aspects of relationships between parents and their adult children\u2014they say that depressive symptoms were most common in the adult children who claimed to be emotionally closer to their mother than their siblings, reports Medical News Today.

Interestingly, the study found no difference between male and female children, but it did find a racial disparity, notes Medical Daily. Adult black children felt their mother's disappointment more acutely than their white counterparts. Researchers hypothesize that sibling rivalry may be behind the depression, meaning more attention or support from mom doesn't necessarily beat out the negative attention from jealous siblings. Or that the favorites are more often asked to help the aging mother, which is its own source of stress. (The adult children in the study had mothers who were 65 to 75 when interviewed.) And yet a third possibility is posed by Bustle: A mother's attention may naturally drift toward the weakest or most sensitive child, thus her favoritism doesn't necessarily cause depression. Researchers plan to look at whether similar results play out with fathers, and whether it's possible to predict favoritism.

MRI data revealed that there were changes in parts of the prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain that controls attention, and in brain sites responsible for control of emotion and the semantic reappraisal of emotion, which represents the different ways a people understand situations based on their perspectives. \"This finding suggests that there appears to be an emotional\" response, says Galanter.",

A study finds that 30% to 50% of the water found in our taps and oceans contains molecules created more than 4.5 billion years ago\u2014making them older than our solar system and the sun, the Los Angeles Times reports. The findings from the study, published in Science, indicate that certain water molecules contain a deuterium atom instead of a hydrogen atom (making what's called \"heavy water\"), which could only be created under very cold, energy-replete conditions\u2014specific conditions that didn't exist before the Earth, sun, and solar system were formed. Earth was actually \"born dry,\" in an extremely hot environment, according to the Times. Scientists believe we eventually received water via comets or asteroids that crashed down on Earth's surface. Figuring out where the water in the comets and asteroids came from, however, is another story, though researchers think they've narrowed it down to two possibilities: that the heavy deuterium water was dispersed among bodies in the solar system during the \"violent\" process of our sun's birth, or that the heavy water originated from ice found in the gas cloud from which our sun and solar system were born. Either way, researchers say this could indicate that young planets all around the universe contain water: According to scientists, there are up to 11 billion planets outside our own system that could house liquid water and, possibly, life, notes Time.

That amount translates to about 105 bottles of wine per resident per year, the Independent notes. And no, this doesn't hinge around all that communion wine.

Robert Meyers says his wife knew Nowsch and had previously given him food and money. \"We knew how bad he was, but we didn't know he was this bad,\" he told reporters, per NBC News. \"[Tammy] spent countless hours at that park consoling this boy ... and she told him to pull his pants up and to be a man, more times than I can count.\" \"Are you all happy? You made my wife look like an animal ... and my son,\" Robert Meyers screamed at reporters yesterday, reports CNN. \"There's the animal, a block away. Are you happy?\" Her husband's outburst of anger stems from a twist in the case: Police revealed that Meyers had actually returned home from an initial encounter with the suspect, picked up her armed 22-year-old son, and drove off again apparently in search of Nowsch. She was killed during a shootout as they returned home from that trip. Robert Meyers says the man threatened to kill his wife and daughter, who was in the car during the first encounter. \"Yes, maybe in a make-up world she should have stayed home,\" he wrote in a text to a CNN producer. \"Please remember statement from this animal, 'I'm going to kill you and your daughter.'\" Police say they are looking for a second suspect but say that Nowsch was the shooter.",

That's a pretty healthy profit for the collector who bought the outfit decades ago for $20 as it was on the verge of being tossed out, CNN reports. James Tumblin, who used to work at Universal Studios, was doing some research at a costume company in the early 1960s when he spotted the Scarlett O'Hara dress. \"I saw this dress on the floor and a docent told me not to bother to pick it up, because they were throwing it away,\" Tumblin tells the Telegraph. Tumblin negotiated a deal to buy it for $20, and \"Word started going around the studios and people who knew about it,\" the managing director of Heritage Auctions tells Reuters. The dress, a gray and black two-piece ensemble featuring black appliques, was the most sought-after item among 150 items from the film that went up for auction. Other standout items include a straw hat worn by Leigh in a number of scenes in the movie and a gray wool suit worn by Clark Gable as his character, Rhett Butler, kicks down the door of Scarlett O\u2019Hara's boudoir.

They found that those who adhered to the Mediterranean diet had longer leukocyte telomeres, which protect the DNA code at the ends of our chromosomes, reports the BBC. \"These results reinforce our advice that eating a balanced and healthy diet can reduce your risk of developing heart disease,\" says a spokesman for the British Heart Foundation, which notes that no single dietary component of the diet is associated with a longer life. The study, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, looked at more than 46,000 women between the ages of 30 and 55 who completed a food frequency questionnaire every four years between 1980 and 1990.

The Toronto Star tells it quite differently: It says it has heard allegations from three women (none willing to go on the record) who describe incredibly violent and non-consensual sex. One told the Star that Ghomeshi had expressed that he would be aggressive, which she took to mean \"he would want to pull my hair and have rough sex. ... [Later] he attacked me. Choked me. Hit me like I didn't know men hit women. I submitted.\" The women told the paper they have not gone to police, reportedly over concerns their names would leak or that sexual texts they sent Ghomeshi would be used against them; they cited the case of Carla Ciccone, who was lambasted online after publishing a story on XOJane about a date she had with a popular radio host and \"repulsive sexual predator.\" Ghomeshi plans to file a $50 million suit against the CBC today; Q is one of the most successful shows the network has ever run.",

The International Fund for Animal Welfare estimates the value of the whale-watch industry at $2.1 billion.

Doctors had to amputate Manteufel's legs at the knees; he also lost his hands, and his nose has to be reconstructed. \"He told the doctors, 'Do what you have to do to keep me alive,'\" Dawn Manteufel tells the Washington Post. She adds they don't know which dog infected her husband: They counted eight dogs he'd been around at the time he fell sick, including his own. The Manteufels will have to sell their house and look for a one-story home now, and Greg Manteufel will no longer be able to work as a house painter or cruise on his Harley. Still, Dawn Manteufel says, \"There's no negativity from him so far.\" A Froedtert & the Medical College of Wisconsin doctor tells FOX6 what happened to Manteufel was a fluke and that \"more than 99% of the people [who] have dogs will never have this issue.\" The GoFundMe for Manteufel has raised more than $28,000.

According to WPTV, Carolyn Hager, 78, was suffering from severe arthritis and other health issues. Police say William Hager told them he had been thinking about killing his wife for days because she wanted to die, but hadn't specifically asked him to kill her. He allegedly shot her in the head while she slept around 7:30am Monday. When police arrived at the couple's Port St. Lucie home, Hager was on the phone and told them, \"I have bad news. I shot my wife at 7:30 this morning. I want to apologize I didn't call earlier. I wanted to tell my kids what happened first.\" Police say Hager took a job at Sears for a while to try and help pay for his wife's medications, but he filed for bankruptcy in 2011.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 William Hager watched his 78-year-old wife, Carolyn, suffer from medical problems, including arthritis, for 15 years. But when the couple could no longer afford her medication, an ominous idea popped into his head, per CNN. Authorities say Hager, 86, called police around 1pm Monday, allegedly telling responding deputies, \"I have bad news. I shot my wife at 7:30 this morning. I want to apologize I didn't call earlier. I wanted to tell my kids what happened first,\" reports WPBF. He said he shot his wife in the head as she slept because she previously said she wanted to die, was in pain, and couldn't afford medication, per an affidavit. \"He felt that he was at a point that this was his only course of action,\" says the chief deputy in Port St. Lucie, Fla. Hager was booked in St. Lucie County Jail and charged with first-degree premeditated murder. A neighbor tells WPTV that Carolyn Hager had complained about \"excruciating\" back pain a few days earlier, but \"they seemed like such a nice couple \u2026 so it was quite a shock.\" Another neighbor says she faced a similar situation when her husband couldn't afford his medication and asked her to shoot him, but she couldn't. \"He suffered so badly and there's nothing you can do,\" she says, noting prescription medications should be more affordable. The Hagers filed for bankruptcy in 2011 and William took a job at Sears to help pay for Carolyn's medications; it isn't clear if he knew a local clinic helps people pay for medications not covered by insurance.",

He was told his appendix had been removed and that the operation was \"otherwise satisfactory,\" according to a lawsuit he has now filed against the hospital and the surgeon who claims to have performed the appendectomy, the Journal News reports. But about a year later, when McCormack started to feel stomach pains again and doctors examined him, they discovered that he still had his appendix. The lawsuit claims that what was actually removed from McCormack was a \"yellowish mass,\" not his appendix, Westchester Now reports. McCormack, an investment banker, says that after the Bronxville surgery, surgeon Michael Kerin told him \"that his appendix was removed, and all was otherwise satisfactory.\" But a report from the hospital's pathology department, however, states that \"there is no evidence of appendix\" and that a specimen bearing McCormack's name and marked \"appendix\" was sent to the pathology department. \"Lawrence Hospital never notified Mr. McCormack that there was no proof of appendix,\" the lawsuit says. \"Despite its knowledge that the specimen marked 'appendix' was not an appendix and/or that something had gone,\" McCormack is suing Kerin and the hospital.",

The 43-year-old is now suing Lawrence Hospital and Dr. Michael Kerin, the surgeon who claimed to have removed McCormack's appendix in January 2013, the Journal News reports. McCormack was on vacation near Lake Placid in early March when he had to undergo emergency surgery, during which surgeons \"discovered that (McCormack's) appendix was never removed and was still inside him,\" according to his lawsuit. Also included in the suit: a copy of the post-op report from Lawrence Hospital, which is signed by Kerin and claims McCormack's appendix had indeed been removed. It's not clear how exactly the hospital failed to alert McCormack he was still in possession of the body part, as a report from the pathology department states, \"there is no evidence of appendix\" in the specimen marked \"appendix.\" So what was removed from McCormack's body?
