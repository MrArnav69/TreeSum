In an interview with the Daily Caller hours before his resignation, Flynn insisted there were \"no lines crossed\" in his conversation with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. \"It wasn't about sanctions. It was about the 35 guys who were thrown out,\" Flynn said, referring to former President Obama's expulsion of Russian diplomats in December. \"It was basically, 'Look, I know this happened. We'll review everything.' I never said anything such as, 'We're going to review sanctions,' or anything like that.\" Legal experts tell Politico that Flynn faces a real risk of prosecution if he wasn't truthful with the FBI, and claiming to have forgotten parts of the conversation probably won't work. Lawyer Mark Zaid says a puzzling aspect of the case is that, as a former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Flynn must have known that conversations with ambassadors from countries like Russia would be under surveillance.

The other, Sgt. Michael Bongiovanni, was captured on video punching the man as he stepped from a vehicle with his hands up. Hollins, who has been charged with marijuana possession, obstruction, and multiple traffic citations, tells WSB-TV that the officer told him he was never going to make a phone call to his mother. \"When I had my hands up, that's when he punched me in the face,\" he says.

Michael Bongiovanni was let go later that day after a second video emerged, per the Washington Post. \"The revelations uncovered in this entire investigation are shocking,\" read a Gwinnett PD statement tweeted Thursday night. Hollins, 21, had been pulled over in Lawrenceville around 4pm Wednesday by Bongiovanni, the police say, and as shown in a video that appeared on the Everything Georgia Twitter feed, Bongiovanni punched Hollins in the face after Hollins came out of the car with his hands up. The other video shows McDonald rushing over as Hollins was lying in the street and slamming his foot into Hollins' head. Hollins' lip and nose appeared to be bloodied in his booking photo. Bongiovanni's incident report said he had pulled Hollins over for a busted brake light and a lack of signaling while changing lanes. The officer said Hollins had started to \"act strange,\" yell, and resist directions, and he remembered similarly disruptive behavior from a previous arrest. Hollins was released on bond Thursday after he was charged with the original citations, in addition to driving with a suspended or revoked license and registration and possessing less than an ounce of pot.

The Guardian reports that the magnitude 7.5 quake was caused by a \"strike-slip fault,\" in which the earth movement is largely horizontal. That kind of movement would not ordinarily create a tsunami, but under certain circumstances it can. \"We won't know what caused it until that's done,\" says James Patton, a seismologist with the British Geological Survey. He says the quake may have caused an undersea landslide that pushed seawater in front of the earthquake's rupture zone, which was about 70 miles long. Another possibility is that the tsunami was created indirectly by the movement of the seafloor. \"The fact that people were still milling around Palu's shoreline when waves were visibly approaching shows the lessons of earlier disasters haven't been absorbed,\" a psychologist tells the AP. \"This points to the failing to do appropriate training and to develop trust so that people know exactly what to do when an alert is issued,\" he says. \"In our project in Bandung, we're finding a similar unwillingness to prepare for something that seems unlikely.\" A high-tech early warning system that was supposed to replace an existing system set up after an earthquake and tsunami killed nearly 250,000 people in the region in 2004 has been stalled in the testing phase for years, the AP reports.

Tsunamis like the 18-foot monster wave that wrecked cities on Sulawesi island are usually caused by \"megathrust\" earthquakes that move land vertically, not \"strike-slip\" quakes like the 7.5-magnitude one Friday, which moved the earth horizontally, Patton says. The Sulawesi event was, however, localized, unlike the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. It may have been the case, Patton says, that massive undersea landslides created the tsunami, or that the narrow bay that Palu sits at the end of concentrated the wave's power. Indonesian authorities have been strongly criticized for apparently canceling the tsunami alert too early, though expert Adam Switzer at the Earth Observatory of Singapore tells the AP that this is unfair. \"What it shows is that the tsunami models we have now are too simplistic,\" he says. \"They don't take into account multiple events, multiple quakes within a short period of time.

To study this, the researchers examined two types of crystals known as phenocrysts, which form when magma cools under a volcano. Varying between 1 and 2 millimeters each, these crystals are too large to have formed during the heat of an explosion. Instead, they grew gradually over time in Yellowstone's magma chamber, each crystal beginning with a core that slowly and steadily enlarged outward, layer upon layer. As surrounding magma conditions changed, trace elements surrounding the growing pheno crysts were recorded. The researchers believe the magma chamber had the same bulk composition as the one that erupted the Lava Creek Tuff, but the water content was much lower: 5% water by weight, 5 times that of an older eruption from the Long Valley Caldera that produced the Bishop Tuff. \"There are multiple ways to trigger an eruption, but as of now, we're seeing evidence for a magma injection,\" says Shamloo.",

Whereas researchers previously thought such an eruption would be centuries or millennia in the making, an analysis of fossilized ash left over from Yellowstone's last supereruption 630,000 years ago reveals the process could take only decades. Tiny crystals left over from underground magma at Yellowstone show the first sign of the last supereruption was a spike in temperature that coincided with the movement of new magma into the reservoir beneath the supervolcano. The crystals also reveal a supereruption followed much quicker than scientists previously thought\u2014perhaps within decades, or what Popular Mechanics calls \"a geologic snap of the finger.\" This is the first indication that \"the conditions that lead to supereruptions might emerge within a human lifetime,\" which one researcher describes as \"shocking,\" per the Times.

Avery, who is seeking to be released on bond, was convicted of first-degree intentional homicide in the death of photographer Teresa Halbach a decade ago. He had been wrongfully convicted years earlier in a rape case and served 18 years in prison before he and his nephew, Brendan Dassey, were arrested in Halbach's death. In the filing, Avery takes issue with a search conducted during the murder investigation, saying improperly included multiple properties and therefore any evidence that was uncovered \"is clearly 'FRUIT OF THE POISONOUS TREE,'\" the AP reports. The appeal, filed Monday in an appeals court in Madison, bears Avery's signature and contains numerous spelling and grammar errors. His new attorney's name doesn't appear on it.

The appeal filed in a Madison court on Monday, which can be seen in full here, accuses authorities of searching his property illegally and claims that a juror with a preconceived notion that he was guilty improperly influenced other jurors during his 2007 trial for the murder of Teresa Halbach, the AP reports. Avery recently secured new legal representation from Chicago-area lawyer Kathleen Zellner and the Midwest Innocence Project, reports WBAY, but Monday's court filing appears to have been prepared without the new legal team. Zellner specializes in reversing convictions, and she says she has found new evidence that will exonerate Avery, reports NBC News. The Netflix documentary suggests that Avery\u2014who served 18 years for a rape he didn't commit before being released two years before the Halbach murder\u2014is the victim of a conspiracy, and a petition urging President Obama and Gov. Scott Walker to free him now has more than 415,000 signatures. Walker, however, has never pardoned anybody, and WBAY reports that he has signaled he isn't going to start with Avery.

Discovered in 2017 at the Guatemalan site of La Corona, the nearly 1,500-year-old engraving depicts a king named Chak Took Ich'aak conjuring gods from a shaft shaped like a snake. Ich'aak later governed the nearby city of El Peru-Waka, suggesting that the so-called Serpent Kingdom or Kaanul dynasty forged a movement that grew until it defeated the towering city-state of Tikal in 562 A.D. \"...

Here's a look at some of the coverage of the 41st president, who was the last American president to serve in World War II: The New York Times looks back at Bush's life, from his humble beginnings in Texas to his years as Ronald Reagan's vice president to his defeat in the 1992 presidential election to his re-election to a second term to George W. Bush. \"He was a man of great humility and integrity,\" says the newspaper's Mark Halperin. The Washington Post has a profile of the man it calls the \"only American president since John Adams to be both a president and father of a president.\" He was \"staunchly loyal\" to Reagan, \"a rarity in American politics\" in that he didn't seek the presidency in his own party, writes Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post. \"But he was also unfailingly loyal to Mr. Reagan\u2014and to his wife, who he loved so much that she sometimes referred to him as her husband.\"",

Here are some early highlights: The broad strokes: For a thorough obituary and assessment, start with the Washington Post. Its story notes that while Bush served just one term as president, it was a consequential one. \"The Berlin Wall fell; the Soviet Union ceased to exist; the communist bloc in Eastern Europe broke up; the Cold War ended.\" And Bush's \"firm, restrained diplomatic sense helped assure the harmony and peace with which these world-shaking events played out, one after the other.\" Great detail: In its obituary, the Wall Street Journal notes that Bush flew 58 missions in the Pacific as a Navy pilot in WWII, all with the name of his girlfriend\u2014Barbara\u2014on the side of the plane. He once got shot down, with this video capturing the rescue. Bush is also the only American besides John Adams to be both president and the father of a president.

NPS spokeswoman Jamie Richards said the man and a companion were scaling the steepest part of the trail where rangers recently installed cables to help hikers to climb the steepest parts of the 4,800-foot ascent. Richards says the companion was helped from the trail and was unharmed. The cables are installed each summer to assist the thousands of hikers who make the popular 14-mile round trip. Richards said investigators are still trying to determine how the fall occurred. She said it's unclear if the hikers were climbing in the rain, but that the well-worn trail over smooth rock was wet.

The ads are \"largely a repeat of attacks we've seen before,\" writes Josh Voorhees at Slate. \"It's the first time that it or any other conservative group has decided to spend big on the airwaves in a bid to bring The Donald back to Earth.\" Trump has called the group \"pathetic\" and \"phony\" and accused it of a \"scam operation,\" but Voorhees says the real conflict is a struggle for control of GOP orthodoxy. \"Conservatives have had a stranglehold on Republican economic policy ideas for years now. Tax cuts for the rich and entitlement cuts for average Americans have become the party's platform, despite the dubious electoral benefits of such.\" The Washington Post notes that the ads are aimed at Tea Partiers, who have helped Trump rise to the top of the polls. \"In reality, though, the feud gets to the heart of why the billionaire's candidacy is so dangerous to the conservative electoral coalition,\" writes Voorhees. \"The big question, of course, is whether the Trump-targeting attacks will work.\"",

Smithsonian reports that five archaeological sites in the Olorgesailie Basin date back 300,000 years to the Middle Stone Age, suggesting humans were able to move further away from Africa and into the Old World than previously thought. The earliest modern humans were believed to have arrived in Africa 100,000 years ago, according to Science. The new research, published in the journal Science, suggests the earliest humans in Africa weren't arriving until about 500,000 years ago. Researchers say they've found glass and ochre tools that are at least 800,000 years older than those of modern humans, and they believe they're the first evidence of long-distance transport of raw materials in Africa. The findings suggest that early humans needed to adapt to climate change, which would have made it difficult for them to find food in the next few hundred thousand years. \"The crux of these papers is that hominin populations did not disappear\u2014so at least some of them must have adapted technologically and culturally, with the environment driving greater mobility, information gathering, and sharing, and innovation,\" the lead researcher says in a press release. \"It is no different than what humans\u2014\"",

Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups\u2014it's not clear which species is responsible\u2014had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools \u2026 designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)",

A critic: In a post at Stuff.co.nz, John Edens thinks the shot was possible, given high-tech gizmos to account for everything from wind speed to the curvature of the earth. Plus, the gun used, a McMillan TAC-50 rifle, employs a 50-caliber bullet the size of a \"large cigar.\" His beef, though, is with media coverage that he thinks glorifies war. \"It's an achievement to a point, but it's not really one humanity should be proud of.\"",

Nevertheless, it raises more questions about how the world's most wanted man managed to shunt his family between cities that span the breadth of Pakistan, apparently undetected and unmolested by the otherwise formidable security services.

As the Guardian notes, the Save the Rhino organization estimates the total world population of black rhinos at around 5,500.

The sources say Joseph James DeAngelo, 72, was living close to where the murders and rapes took place in the 1970s and '80s. The DNA found at the crime scene led investigators to a distant relative of DeAngelo who had shared his genetic profile on GEDmatch, the sources say. Paul Holes, the retired Contra Costa County DA who helped lead the investigation, tells the AP that he used his own DNA profile from Ancestry.com to learn how to use GEDmatch. The site returned a list of relatives\u2014with names and emails\u2014by degree of shared single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs, which offer a genetic fingerprint. On average, you share 50% of your SNPs with a sibling, 25% with a half sibling, 12.5% with a first cousin, and 3.1% with a second cousin. The hits on DeAngelo came from third and fourth cousins, Holes says. Experts say GEDmatch is a good example of the potential danger of using genetic information for law enforcement purposes without proper safeguards. \"Even though it is easy to think of this technology as something that is used just to track down serial killers, if we allow the government to use it with no accountability or no further safeguards, then all of our genetic information might be at risk for being used for things we don't want it to be used for,\" UC Berkeley law professor Katherine Roth tells the Times. DeAngelo has been charged with two murders and is expected to be arraigned Friday.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A distant relative of Joseph James DeAngelo hoping to learn more about their family submitted a DNA sample to a genealogy website. They now know that they're related to a suspected serial killer. Police say they tracked the suspected Golden State Killer by comparing DNA from one of his many crime scenes to genetic information freely available online, the Sacramento Bee reports. They traced family trees for possible suspects and singled out DeAngelo, a 72-year-old ex-cop, last Thursday. Sacramento County District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert says DeAngelo was placed under surveillance, and DNA collected from discarded items provided \"astronomical evidence\" that he was the killer. Schubert tells the Bee that when she was informed of the DNA test results, \"I probably used a few words I wouldn't put in a newspaper, but basically said, 'You'd better not be lying to me.'\" She adds: \"There were a lot of holy s--- moments.\" DeAngelo was arrested outside his home Tuesday. The San Jose Mercury News reports that investigators used the open-source genealogy website GEDMatch.com to search for the suspect who committed 12 murders and more than 50 rapes between 1974 and 1986. Other genealogy websites, including Ancestry.com and 23andMe, say they weren't contacted by police about the case and that they never provide customer information to law enforcement unless they're legally compelled to.

In an Aug. 11 letter to Paltrow and Goop's outside counsel, TINA.org warned that the company \"does not possess the competent and reliable scientific evidence required by law to make such claims.\" The group says more than 50 instances in which Goop claims \"either expressly or implicitly\" that its products or third-party products \"can treat, cure, prevent, alleviate, the symptoms of, or reduce the risk of developing a number of ailments\" have been found on the Goop website. Goop says it has removed \"a number of inappropriate health statements\" from its site, including claims to prevent uterine prolapse (Better Sex Jade Eggs), as well as claims to treat acne, depression, and psoriasis (Black Rose Bar).

Those products, of course, are either sold by or promoted by Goop, but Goop doesn't have the scientific evidence legally required to make such claims about the products, per TINA. The watchdog group has submitted a complaint letter to two of the California Food, Drug, and Medical device Task Force's district attorneys requesting enforcement. A Goop spokesperson reached out to BuzzFeed (which has helpfully compiled some of the products TINA takes issue with, including a crystal said to treat infertility, hair treatments for depression, and a vaginal egg to prevent uterus slipping) to say that TINA's claims are \"misleading ... unsubstantiated and unfounded.\" Goop was also recently called out by NASA over body stickers supposedly containing spacesuit material, and soon after, a San Francisco OB-GYN made headlines when she called out Goop for promoting the aforementioned vaginal eggs, among other things. In fact, Dr. Jen Gunter's posts about Goop spurred the website to issue a defense, with Team Goop writing: \"As women, we chafe at the idea that we are not intelligent enough to read something and take what serves us, and leave what does not.

Drake this week filed a bill that would put an end to lethal injection and give convicts facing death the choice of the latter two, reports the AP. \"I think if you ask a hundred people, not even talking to criminals, how would you like to die, if you were drowned, if you were shot, and if you say you were put to sleep, 90% of some of the people would say I want to be put to sleep,\" says the Republican, who apparently equates lethal injection with taking a permanent nap. \"Let's put our pants back on the right way,\" Drake urges, adding that his proposed switch would force death row inmates to think about their punishment \"every morning.\" And they'd be getting off easy, because, as reported by the Florida Current, if it were up to Drake, \"we would just throw them off the Sunshine Skyway bridge and be done with it.\" Mediaite notes that Keith Olbermann is not a fan of the idea.

The so-called \"Granny's Revenge\" was written on a piece of parchment that's about the size of a sesame seed. It was discovered in Columbia's collection of 40,000 ancient papyrus fragments, and researchers say it's \"virtually like every other papyrus manuscript we've looked at.\" The Granny was likely written by someone who lived in what is now Lebanon around AD800, around the time of the Battle of Thermopylae, according to a university press release. Researchers say the Granny, whose ink is similar to that found in most ancient papyrus manuscripts, is likely the work of an Egyptian nobleman who was killed in a battle with a group of monks. \"It's a very significant find because it is the first known example of a well-written, well-documented forgery,\" the lead researcher tells the New York Times. Harvard professor Karen King, who has been leading the charge against the \"Gospel of Jesus' Wife,\" isn't giving up on the fragment. In a new edition of the Harvard Theological Review, she writes that new scientific tests haven't turned up evidence of a modern forgery. But she still thinks the Coptic fragment is an authentic document. \"I\u2019m basically hoping that we can move past the issue of forgery to questions about the significance of this fragment for the history of Christianity,\" she tells the Boston Globe.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 To call it controversial is putting it mildly: Harvard professor Karen L. King in September 2012 debuted an ancient papyrus now known as the \"Gospel of Jesus' Wife\" at a conference in Rome. The papyrus makes an explicit reference to the woman's existence with the line, \"Jesus said to them, 'My wife...'\" Now, extensive testing by professors from Columbia, Harvard, and MIT in the fields of electrical engineering, chemistry, and biology has found no indications that it is a modern forgery, per an article by King published today in the Harvard Theological Review. The Boston Globe says it most likely dates to eighth-century Egypt, and the chemical composition of its ink is in line with the carbon-based inks the people of that country used at the time. But the Globe cautions that a master forger could have accessed the proper materials, and that traditional ink-dating methods couldn't be used because the papyrus is so small: a fragment roughly 1.5-by-3 inches in size bearing just eight incomplete lines (translation here). The Review also published a rebuttal by Brown Egyptology professor Leo Depuydt, who points to \"gross grammatical errors\" he says no native speaker of Coptic would make, the New York Times reports. (More criticism of the papyrus here.) The new findings certainly don't prove that Jesus was married, a point that King has never challenged; she'd like to see the debate shift to discussions of the document's significance, and \"questions like, 'Why does Jesus being married, or not, even matter?'\" King was in 2011 asked to review the fragment at the request of its anonymous owner, who says he bought it more than a decade earlier from a collector who said he purchased it, along with five others, in East Germany in the '60s.",
