John Roberts said the company was only using thousands of small antennas, instead of a few big ones \"to get around copyright laws,\" the Wall Street Journal reports.

At one point, Anthony Kennedy suggested lawyers pretend that decision had come from the high court. Ultimately, the justices didn't seem to like their options. \"This is really hard for me,\" Sotomayor confessed. \"I don't see how to get out of it,\" Breyer agreed.",

Ford\u2014who campaigned on a platform that included a 10 cents-a-liter cut in gasoline taxes\u2014says he plans to cut spending by $6 billion and has promised not to cut even a public-sector job. \"I'm ready to take my seat at Queen's Park,\" says Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner, who made history by becoming the first Green Party member of Ontario's legislature.

The cause of the crash hasn't been determined, though officials believe the rugged terrain may have played a role. \"There's a possibility the aircraft hit a peak and then fell into a ravine because the place that it was found is steep,\" a search and rescue official tells Reuters, which notes that Trigana has a very patchy safety record, with 14 serious incidents since it started flying in 1991, including 10 in which the aircraft was destroyed. The plane was also carrying $468,750 in cash, which was to be distributed to poor families.",

Austin Pledger, from Thorsby, Ala., was first prescribed Risperdal, manufactured by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, in 2002 when he was 8; at the time, the drug wasn't FDA-approved for kids, and its label said risk was \"low\" for gynecomastia (the condition in which men's breasts grow larger), Thomas Kline, one of Pledger's attorneys, tells the Daily News. But when the FDA gave the green light in 2006 for the drug to be used as a schizophrenic aid for kids, new labels said the drug contained high levels of the hormone prolactin, which spurs breast growth, Kline adds. Pledger had started growing breasts by then\u2014and now, the only way he can get rid of them is through a mastectomy, Kline says. A Janssen spokeswoman sent a statement to People noting the company is \"disappointed\" in the decision and that the drug's side effects were clearly spelled out for Pledger's family and prescribing physician. The spokeswoman also argued that Pledger's \"quality of life was significantly improved during the time he was taking Risperdal,\" per the Daily News.

Police took the girl to police headquarters and contacted her mother, who confessed to leaving the girl alone for three days. Her daughter is now in the custody of her grandmother. \"It angers me, as a citizen, to see the police overreach this way,\" writes Elspeth Reeve at Slate. \"How is it benefiting this child to be put in the Custody of Social Services?\" The state's decision is \"coming at a time when it is suffering from a shortage of foster families, as well as a child protective services workforce so overwhelmed that serious child abuse inquiries are regularly closed in violation of policy,\" Reeve writes. \"By arresting this mom (presumably causing her to lose her job) and putting the child in foster care, the state has caused the child far more trauma than she was.\"",

The 46-year-old South Carolina mom repeatedly sent her 9-year-old daughter to a well-trafficked park while she went to work at McDonald's. When the parents of other children at the park found out, they called police, who arrested Harrell and charged her with unlawful conduct toward a child. The daughter has been placed in state custody. Local news outlets first reported the story on July 1, but it's been getting wider attention lately thanks to an indignant post on Reason from \"Free Range Kids\" advocate Lenore Skenazy. And so far, pretty much everyone agrees that the arrest is senseless and wrong. Some reactions: Skenazy notes that the original news reports make it sound like Harrell \"committed a serious, unconscionable crime,\" as locals speculate that the girl could have been kidnapped. \"To which I must ask: In broad daylight? In a crowded park? Just because something happened on Law & Order doesn't mean it's happening all the time in real life.\" \"Since I'm a parent, Harrell\u2019s arrest scares me: How can I appropriately parent my child when doing something that seems relatively safe, if out of fashion, can get you arrested?\" asks Jessica Grose at Slate. One law professor tells Grose that the statutes for child welfare laws are often broadly written, giving police lots of latitude\u2014and allowing \"race, class, and gender biases to influence decisions.\" That could be the case here, because Harrell is black, and her poverty helped cause the situation. \"The story is a convergence of helicopter parenting with America\u2019s primitive family policy,\" writes Jonathan Chait at New York. \"Our welfare policy is designed to make everybody, even single mothers, work full-time jobs. The social safety net makes it difficult for low-wage single mothers to obtain adequate child care. And society is seized by bizarre fears that children are routinely snatched up by strangers in public places,\" which is actually an exceedingly rare phenomenon. \"The state has caused the child far more trauma than she was ever likely to suffer in the park,\" writes Conor Friedersdorf at the Atlantic, and they're taking the child at a time when the state has a shortage of foster families. And there's no empirical evidence saying the child would be safer, say, sitting at McDonald's. \"The actual safety of a given kid is not being rigorously determined.

After the Senate majority leader pulled the plug on the GOP plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare on Monday, Trump called him \"weak\" at a dinner with conservative activists at the White House on Monday night, two attendees tell Politico. Trump complained about how Republicans had failed him on the issue, saying he was disappointed that McConnell didn't change the Senate filibuster rule so that only 51 votes are needed to pass legislation. He also complained about McConnell's resistance to changing the rule, which Democrats have been able to use to their advantage. Trump has publicly criticized McConnell before, but this is the first time he's called him out publicly. In a Monday night tweet, Trump slammed the \"fake news media\" for celebrating Moore's win in the Alabama Senate race \"when the reality and truth are that Moore is the most Trumpian senate candidate in America today.\" Moore, who will face Democrat Doug Jones in the Dec. 12 election, has said he wants to oust McConnell as majority leader. \"Judge Roy Moore in the US Senate means the END of Mitch McConnell\u2019s reign as Majority Leader,\" he said in a fundraising pitch after the defeat of incumbent Luther Strange, who had Trump's support. Trump appointed Strange to fill John McCain's seat in the Senate, and McConnell promised to support Strange's opponent, Roy Moore. \"What happens today in Alabama with Luther Strange has nothing to do with Mitch McConnell,\" said Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \"It has everything todo with Alabama.\"",

The Senate majority leader had to surrender on ObamaCare repeal, ally Bob Corker announced he was retiring, and, perhaps worst of all, the Senate candidate that McConnell strongly backed in Alabama got trounced by one backed by the Steve Bannon contingent. Just how bad is it for McConnell? Here's a look at coverage: Mocked by Trump: The president has taken to doing physical impressions of a slump-shouldered McConnell, reports Axios. Trump also reportedly called out McConnell as \"weak\" at a dinner with conservative activists, reports Politico. On the wane: McConnell has gone from \"brilliant tactician\" to looking vulnerable after the defeats this week, reports the New York Times. If the GOP fails to get tax reform passed this year, his post as majority leader could be in jeopardy\u2014especially with populist insurgents backed by Bannon looking to win more seats. No immediate danger: Both Politico and the Times say McConnell retains rock-solid support in the Republican Conference and thus is not in any immediate peril. Much of that support is based on his formidable fundraising skills on behalf of Senate Republicans. Beware the midterms: In a piece subtitled, \"Is the Senate Leader Losing His Grip on the GOP?,\" Abigail Tracy at Vanity Fair notes that midterm elections in general are often unkind to the party in power: \"With the GOP in the midst of an ideological schism, McConnell\u2019s faction could be headed for a reckoning.\" Indeed, Tuesday's triple whammy \"just shows how weak the Republican establishment is right now,\" writes Harry Enten at FiveThirtyEight. Boehner's fate? McConnell is willing to take all the criticism coming from conservatives over the ObamaCare fail, especially if it protects rank-and-file Republicans, per an analysis at the Washington Post. \"But one thing that could hamper McConnell\u2019s long-term standing would be if he became a real albatross to his own incumbents in primary elections ahead,\" writes Paul Kane. Fear of that played a role in John Boehner's resignation as House speaker two years ago. False narrative: Many in the media are portraying the Alabama results as a loss for Trump, but winner Roy Moore is decidedly Trumpian, writes Erick Erickson at the Resurgent.

Tannerite is a product typically used for target practice; it is placed on targets and explodes when struck by a bullet from a high-powered rifle. It's sold in two inert parts (ammonium nitrate and aluminum powder), neither of which is regulated by the ATF. Once those two parts are mixed together, it only explodes if a bullet hits it and is considered very stable, a corporate investigator for Tannerite says. Tannerite residue was found inside the bomb that exploded in Chelsea, a federal law enforcement official tells USA Today. A post on the company's Facebook page Monday reads, \"The entire staff of Tannerite stands together in the abhorrence and unintended use of all products that are misused for violence and hate.\" It goes on to note that its investigator is working to verify that Tannerite was indeed used in the bomb. A former FBI agent tells CBS News Tannerite appears to be \"on the defensive.\" \"It\u2019s just something we have to be aware of that these terrorists are very clever at finding out what components can come together and make an improvised exploding device,\" he says.

She hasn't been heard from since, and police have never made an arrest in the case. But that changed Monday night, when Anthony Palma was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and kidnapping, NBC News reports. \"This is the initial stage of this case,\" says Midwest City Police Chief Brandon Clabes. \"We have a lot more work to do in reference to this case.\" Palma, 56, was one of at least 10 men interviewed by police in the years following Hatfield's abduction, but his DNA match to evidence found at the scene was one in 293 sextillion, police say, per KOCO. Police believe Palma targeted Hatfield for sexual assault, and evidence shows his blood was on her partially ripped underwear and window sill, Fox 25 reports. Palma, who was convicted of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon in the early 1980s and released from prison in 1986, was living just two homes down from the Hatfields.

This feels calculated, in the best possible way, to happen at the best possible time. Now.\" Apple has lost its core, writes Rupert Goodwins for ZDNet, and only time will tell how this plays out. The iPhone and iPad can only be updated so many times, and with Jobs \"there was always a 'next.'\" But \"Apple as innovator without Jobs is Apple unknown.\" Its future \"depends on the new next, and the longer we have to wait to see what happens, the less likely it will happen at all.\"",

Aaron Leider sued the zoo in 2007 claiming it subjected elephants to \"cruel, abusive, and illegal treatment\" by using chains, drugs, bullhooks, and electric shocks. A judge ordered the zoo to change its treatment, but an appeals court upheld the ruling. On Thursday, the state Supreme Court ruled that Leider couldn't use the taxpayer money to enforce the criminal mistreatment of the elephants, according to the San Jose Mercury News. \u201cThe trial court found that the city and its zoo director had violated penal code statutes proscribing animal abuse, but it provided them neither the right to a jury trial nor the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d Justice Carol Corrigan wrote for the unanimous court. \u201cMoreover, Leider was permitted to exercise the discretion reserved for the district attorney with regard to enforcement of the criminal law. For these reasons, the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment cannot stand.\u201d Leider's attorney called the ruling \"extremely disappointing\" and said evidence showed elephants had died prematurely because of conditions at the zoo. He said he hoped for a retrial before a jury.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 For years, the Los Angeles Zoo has been under a court order requiring it to exercise its three elephants on soft ground and not use electric shocks or barbed sticks on them. On Thursday, that court order was overturned in a unanimous decision by the California Supreme Court that animal activists are decrying. A Los Angeles County Superior Court judge issued the injunction against the zoo in 2012 in response to a taxpayer lawsuit alleging animal cruelty. But in what the Los Angeles Times calls a \"highly technical ruling\" overturning the injunction, the state's highest court said a taxpayer lawsuit (which uses civil law rules) can't be used to address criminal conduct. The taxpayer lawsuit began in 2007 when an LA resident sued over what he said was abusive treatment of the elephants, also including the use of chains and drugs, Courthouse News Service reports. A lawyer who worked on the case, for free, for more than five years says he'll attempt to find another way to get a similar injunction against the zoo, or request that the state legislature overturn the ruling. \"I thought we had done something here to move the ball forward and instead the Supreme Court has allowed the zoo to take a step into the Dark Ages,\" he says. The Supreme Court explained in its ruling that by obtaining the injunction in such a way, the court did not allow the zoo to have a jury trial or the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The barbed sticks known as bull hooks have since been banned entirely in California, and for its part, the zoo says that it has never used and will never use them or electric shocks as disciplinary tools for its elephants, and that it will continue to follow the court order despite it being overturned.",

The Guardian reports the giraffe population has dropped by more than 30% over the past three decades, from 155,000 in 1985 to 97,000 in 2015. The animal is now only found in 21 countries. \"Many species are slipping away before we can even describe them,\" IUCN Director General Inger Andersen says. \"This is something that we were a little shocked about, that they have declined by so much in so little time.\" The population of the Okapi, a type of giraffe found on the African continent, has declined by 50% over the same period. The giraffe population is falling in size, with wild giraffes gone from seven countries, including Burkina Faso, Eritrea, Guinea, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Senegal.",

But new numbers from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature show a significant decline in their population over the past three decades and have conservationists worried that the elegant creature is falling victim to what one IUCN expert calls a \"silent extinction,\" the BBC reports. In 1985, there were between 152,000 and 163,000 giraffes, but that number dropped to 97,000 by 2015\u2014a \"devastating decline\" of nearly 40% that now moves the animal from the \"least concern\" category into the \"vulnerable\" one on the group's Red List. \"While there [has] been great concern about elephants and rhinos, giraffes have gone under the radar,\" says Dr. Fennessy, co-director of the IUCN's Giraffe Conservation arm. The updated Red List, released Thursday at a biological diversity conference in Cancun, Mexico, points to man as the main driver of the declining stats, with poaching, habitat loss, and local unrest all assuming partial blame. A Duke University conservation biologist says the IUCN is partly to blame, too, for not considering more species threatened. \"There's a strong tendency to think that familiar species [such as giraffes, chimps, etc.] must be OK because ... we see them in zoos,\" he tells the AP. \"This is dangerous.\" Some good news, at least for some long-neckers: Of the nine giraffe subspecies, three of them are experiencing increasing populations; one is stable.

Dennis Herrera has been investigating the company since October under a state unfair competition law, targeting its marketing claims that the amount of caffeine in its products is \u201ccompletely safe\u201d and that consumers \u201ccan ever get too Much of a Good thing!\u201d In March, Herrera joined a group of 18 doctors from medical centers across the country in calling for the FDA to regulate caffeine levels in energy drinks, saying the beverages pose health risks, particularly for youths. Under current FDA standards, caffeine in sodas can register no higher than about 71 milligrams per 12-ounce serving. Energy drinks often have between 100 and 300 milligrams of caffeine per 8-oz. serving and are often sold in much larger quantities per can, according to the doctors' letter. In a lawsuit filed Monday in US District Court in Los Angeles, Monster Energy says Herrera's effort would \"impose undue burdens on interstate commerce\" and violate constitutionally protected \"commercial speech\" and other rights. The company, in its lawsuit, maintains that its product has less than half the caffeine of a Starbucks coffee. \"Today, any child can walk into a Starbucks and buy an unlimited number of 'Grande,'\" the lawsuit reads, per the San Francisco Chronicle.",

Monster sued the office of Dennis Herrera this week, arguing that its drinks are no more harmful than a cup of Starbucks coffee and making the case that only the FDA can regulate the market, reports the Wall Street Journal. One thing in particular that irritates Herrera is that the company has a Monster Army website for kids that shows an 11-year-old \"Monster Army Major\" and a 6-year-old \"Reserve,\" reports the San Francisco Chronicle. So, yes, the energy drinks have less caffeine than a cup at Starbucks, but the coffee chain \"isn\u2019t marketing sweet drinks that are highly caffeinated to young people,\u201d says a Herrera spokesperson.
