Their 21-year-old son, Matthew Lindquist, was a person of interest in the case, and Ruth Correa, 56, was arrested Thursday and charged with murder, robbery, arson, and other crimes, the Hartford Courant reports. According to an arrest warrant application, Correa told police her brother told her he owed a man money and that he was going to pretend to give him drugs and guns in exchange for drugs and cash. Correa said she and her brother Sergio Correa went to the Lindquist home in Griswold with the intention of stealing guns and drugs from Kenneth Lindquist's father, who usually went to bed around 7pm, NBC Connecticut reports. She said the plan went awry when the son panicked and backed out of the plan to make the robbery look like a robbery, according to court documents unsealed Tuesday. The documents also include texts between Matthew and the suspects before the killings. \"If u pull up street from my house and give me a stack, I'll show u right where safe is,\" Matthew allegedly texted one of the suspects hours before his parents' bodies were found. Court documents state that Correa admitted to stabbing Matthew 10 times and hitting him and his parents with a bat before setting the house on fire. A witness says Correa told him she drugged Matthew and killed him before going to the house and killing the mother and father.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 For more than four months, 21-year-old Matthew Lindquist was considered a suspect in the murders of his parents, found inside their burned-out home in Griswold, Conn., on Dec. 20. All the time, he was lying dead 1,500 feet away, a third victim of what police describe as a fake robbery turned real. According to an arrest affidavit released Tuesday, Lindquist had offered his father's guns to a man in exchange for drugs, so long as the man staged the scene to look like a burglary. That's not what happened. Now charged in the case, 23-year-old Ruth Correa reportedly told police her brother, Sergio Correa, hit Lindquist in the head with a machete after Lindquist panicked, per the Washington Post. The siblings then stabbed Lindquist, leaving his body in the woods near his parents' home, which they entered through a basement door they knew to be unlocked, per the affidavit. When Kenneth and Janet Lindquist appeared, 26-year-old Sergio hit Kenneth, 56, with a baseball bat while Ruth told Janet that \"her son had set her up,\" the affidavit states, per NBC Connecticut. The document says Sergio then choked Janet, 61, and hit her in the head with the bat before he and his sister set the house alight and took off with stolen goods and Matthew Lindquist's car, later found burned. After reportedly telling police that her brother might be planning to kill her, Ruth Correa was arrested on charges of murder, home invasion, arson, and robbery on May 12, a week after Matthew Lindquist's body was found. At the time, police said additional arrests were expected. Sergio Correa has yet to be charged, though. He's in police custody following a February arrest for probation violations and \"maintains he had nothing to do with this,\" his lawyer tells the Hartford Courant.",

Mason was arrested and charged with voter fraud after her name was found on a list of people who hadn't voted in a presidential election in 30 years.

For example, as the New York Times notes, in Vermont, a person convicted of murder retains the right to vote, even while in prison.

The commission famously concluded that Oswald acted alone, spawning decades of conspiracy theories involving Castro, the Mafia, the CIA, the Soviets, and even President Lyndon B. Johnson. Seems the White House nudged McCone along: He \"shared the administration\u2019s interest in avoiding disclosures about covert actions that would circumstantially implicate [the] CIA in conspiracy theories and possibly lead to calls for a tough US response against the perpetrators of the assassination,\" reads the article, which was published in a CIA internal magazine in 2013 and declassified (with 15 redactions) last fall.

Depressed people tended to use the Inkwell filter most often (non-depressed people preferred Valencia) and got more comments on their posts (non-depressed people got more likes). Depressed people also posted more photos of faces but had fewer faces per photo.

That's a big step for the creature Tully discovered when he was hunting for fossils in the Mazon Creek geological deposits southeast of Chicago in 1955. Previously the Tully monster, with its torpedo body, hammerhead-like eyes, and long proboscis filled with sharp teeth, had been categorized as \"problematica\"\u2014\"creatures that defied ready classification,\" the Chicago Tribune reports.

The singular they is.\" Walsh, who has been the Post's copy editor since 1997, is referring to those who don't identify as male or female but identify as non-binary, meaning neither man nor female, Time reports.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Jane Austen wrote, \"To be sure, you knew no actual good of me\u2014but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love.\" But had she submitted that line to a modern English teacher, she would have gotten docked for grammar. Instead of \"when they fall in love,\" it should be \"when he falls in love,\" or perhaps the clunkier \"when he or she falls in love,\" right? That has long been the prevailing view, but after a slow and steady creep, that view seems to be disappearing. In fact, this year might be the tipping point for acceptance of the \"singular they.\" Quartz, for example, has dubbed singular they its Word of the Year. And earlier this month, the Washington Post changed its style guide to accept it, though the guide still encourages reporters to first try to write around it by recasting the sentence as plural, notes Poynter. So, \"All students must complete their homework, not Each student must complete his or her homework,\" per the guide. But when that kind of rewrite is \"impossible or hopelessly awkward,\" writers should employ the singular they. One big factor behind the shift\u2014not just at the Post but in newspapers, online posts, and English classrooms across the country\u2014is the increasing acceptance in society of those who identify as neither male nor female. The singular they solves the problem. (On a related note, the New York Times now permits \"Mx.\" as a gender-neutral honorific in place of Mr. or Ms., notes Quartz.) Grammatical purists may protest, but they are simply wrong, writes English teacher Anne Curzan at the Chronicle for Higher Education. \"There is nothing grammatically wrong with singular they other than the fact that people say there is something wrong with it,\" she writes, noting the similarity to the outdated rule, still enforced in places, about not splitting infinitives. Adds Anna Walsh at Baltimore's City Paper, \"Using language that's more accurately inclusive is something that every grammarian should be able to get behind, regardless of what pronouns they personally use.\" (The Internet seems to have invented a preposition.)",

Scrivano notes the idea for a bacon-wrapped crust came from an employee in Little Caesars' research and development wing who ordered a bacon-wrapped filet at a restaurant. The pizza adaptation will be available nationwide until late April, CBS Detroit reports. A warning: it may not \"travel\" well, Scrivano says.

The problem is that air is getting thinner as it warms, and that thin air means less lift for the plane's wings, which then race along the runway. The study, which looked at 27 different global climate models, found that at busy airports in Denver, Phoenix, Chicago, Atlanta, New York, Washington, DC, Los Angeles, Houston, and Miami, a Boeing 777-300 departing from Dubai at the time of the daily highest temperature may be weight-restricted 55% of the time. LaGuardia is likely to be hardest-hit because of its short runways, while Dubai is at the bottom of the list due to its longer runways. \"All the published studies have been about thing getting worse,\" a climate scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research tells the New York Times. \"Our results suggest that weight restriction may impose a non-trivial cost.\"",

The problem centers around the wings\u2019 capacity for lift, which is lessened in warmer conditions. By 2100, worldwide average temperatures are expected to rise by 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit. To safely take off, airlines would need to make adjustments during the hottest part of the day, with 10% to 30% of planes affected.

Not so, says the Chinese government, at least when it comes to the Zhangjiajie Grand Canyon bridge\u2014the highest, longest glass bridge in the world, according to Mashable. In fact, the operators of the bridge allowed Dan Simmons of BBC Click to take a sledgehammer to the glass-bottom bridge that, per the China National Tourism Office, spans more than 1,400 feet (it points out the Grand Canyon Skywalk measures only 69) and is suspended some 1,000 feet above the ground. Simmons' first whack resulted in cracking to the top of a glass panel. But after a dozen blows, the lower two layers were unscathed. The stunt was an attempt to prove the safety of glass bridges after a glass-bottom skywalk in China was closed last year due to cracking that had tourists scrambling to get off of the more than 3,280-foot-high structure. The cracks to a glass panel were caused by a dropped thermos, per the South China Morning Post. The new bridge, which is 20 feet wide and capable of holding up to 800 people at once, is set to open to the public in July, per ABC, which adds that \"those wishing for an even more terrifying adventure\" may someday be able to bungee jump from the structure.

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Opioids like OxyContin and Percocet are often prescribed to treat chronic pain, but a new study finds they can also lead to long-term, potentially deadly opioid use. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they examined the medical records of nearly 500,000 Medicare beneficiaries who visited an emergency department for an opioid prescription between 2008 and 2011. They found that patients who received an opioids prescription from an emergency medicine physician were more likely to be prescribed the drugs within 30 days of their emergency department visit than patients who got them from a physician who didn't bill for emergency department visits, reports the Los Angeles Times. The rate of \"long-term opioid use\"\u2014defined as more than 180 days of use\u2014was 10.3% higher for patients prescribed opioids than for those who received them from physicians who did not bill for ER visits. The researchers say the findings suggest that physicians should be more careful when prescribing opioids to patients with chronic pain. \"This is one more piece of the puzzle that says we need to do a better job of informing physicians and patients about the risks and benefits of these drugs,\" the study's lead author says in a press release. \"We also need to be more vigilant about who is prescribing these drugs.\" (Meanwhile, some emergency room doctors may be over-prescribing opioids.)",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Scientists trying to better understand the nation's rising opioid addictions have uncovered an interesting wrinkle: A patient's risk of getting hooked might depend on which ER doctor they happen to get. In a New England Journal of Medicine study, researchers found that patients whose ER doctors are more likely to prescribe opioids are more likely to develop an addiction compared to the patients of ER doctors who prescribe less frequently. It may sound like an obvious chain of events, but it remains unclear why two patients given the same opioid prescription after similar complaints have different addiction risks depending on their ER doc. The takeaway is \"not that high-intensity prescribers are necessarily irresponsible in prescribing opioids to certain patients,\" the lead author tells the New York Times. But \"their patients have worse outcomes that we weren\u2019t aware of before.\" After tracking 375,000 Medicare patients in ERs between 2008 and 2011, researchers found that one in every 48 patients prescribed opioids ends up using them long-term, or more than half a year. But when comparing \"high-intensity\" prescribing docs (who gave opioids to one in four patients) to \"low-intensity\" prescribers (one in 14), patients of the first group had a 30% greater risk of turning into long-time users. It may be a simple numbers game, as observed in a post at Pacific Standard: \"The more prescriptions doctors give out, the more likely they'll end up handing a script to someone who will have a serious problem later.\" But one doctor sees a larger issue: Among ER doctors, there's no consensus \"about when to prescribe opioids and what dose to give.\" (This is how long it takes to become dependent.)",

Trump himself, his family, and several living ex-presidents will be in attendance, including Jimmy Carter, Dick Cheney, and George W. Bush, reports Politico.

Stephen Miller, who served as campaign manager for Trump, will deliver it, reports the New York Times. Aides say the speech will be short, and Trump is reviewing previous inaugurals.

He will deliver his inaugural address at 11:51am, according to the AP's timeline, and analysts say it will be one of the most closely watched in history. Advisers say that, like many predecessors, Trump will issue a call for unity and give his vision of \"one America.\" Experts tell NBC News that Trump's unique and repetitive speaking style will drive the message home and maybe even go a little way toward unifying America. \"If I keep saying it, it becomes it,\" says New York University neuroscience professor David Poeppel. In other coverage: The Los Angeles Times reports that Trump has said he looked to the speeches of Ronald Reagan, John F. Kennedy, and Richard Nixon to prepare\u2014and of the three, Nixon might be most relevant. After winning with a minority of the popular vote in the deeply divisive 1968 election, Nixon called on the \"better angels of our nature\" in his inaugural address, saying America had heard too much inflated and bombastic rhetoric. \"We cannot learn from one another until we stop shouting at one another,\" he said. The San Francisco Chronicle lists five things to look for in Trump's address, including efforts to reassure foreign leaders. Ad-libs are also a strong possibility, though analysts say trying to wing it could be a big mistake. The speech was largely written by incoming senior White House adviser Stephen Miller, Politico reports in its guide to inaugural events, which includes viewing tips and the order of the ceremony. The Washington Post looks at the many demonstrations that will be taking place across the capital on Friday, including a few pro-Trump events, as well as numerous \"counterinaugural\" protests. The \"Let America Hear Us, Roar for Trump\" group will be sharing Dupont Circle with a pro-marijuana group that plans to hand out 4,200 joints.

The idea is to infect females with genetic mutations that impair their ability to swim. They'd have sterile male offspring, but their daughters would be able to breed, producing more sterile males. It's a \"coup de grce,\" says ecologist Daniel Tompkins, who's working on the project with the government's Landcare Research institute. \"Once the numbers are small, releasing a few Trojan females would cap population, he says. Those small populations might then simply die out naturally, or survive at such low levels that they would no longer pose a threat to native species.\" Tompkins and his colleagues have already shown in computer models and lab experiments that this technique can work in fruit flies, where a single release kept population numbers low over 10 generations, with no sign of natural selection fighting back. But in mammals, releasing thousands of Trojan female rats would be counterproductive, because they'd be just as much of a danger to the ecosystem as the ones you're trying to get rid of.

The Department of Conservation explains that cereal bait laced with rodent toxin was dropped via helicopter on the island during the winter of 2016. A team scoured the island last month looking for any mice and found none. \"This is huge news for conservation both in New Zealand and internationally,\" says New Zealand Conservation Minister Eugenie Sage. She says more than two dozen types of birds, 21 uncommon plants, and more than 150 insect species will benefit. Both Radio New Zealand and NPR note the mice originally found their way to the Antipodes either on 19th-century ships or via a shipwreck and proceeded to purge the island of at least two insect species, as well as to displace some seabirds to other islands. The initiative in the Antipodes isn't a stand-alone: The island nation has also gotten rid of other invasive species in the name of boosting biodiversity, including goats, rats, cats, rabbits, and a local meat-eating weasel. New Zealand's ultimate goal is to rid itself completely of all invasive pests by 2050, per Nature. (Scientists are bashing in the heads of invasive iguanas in Florida.)",

'Line in the sand': Though the US did not intervene as the Islamic State swept across much of Iraq in recent weeks, the city of Irbil in northern Iraq \"appears to be a line in the sand,\" writes Dan Lamothe in the Washington Post. It's the Kurdish capital, and the US has diplomats and military advisers stationed there among the American allies. (The Islamic State also reportedly controls the country's largest dam, in the northern city of Mosul.) How far? \"The question arises: How far is Mr. Obama willing to go?\" writes Peter Baker in the New York Times. Obama said \"there is 'no American military solution' to the Iraqi insurgency, pointing again to the need for a new politically inclusive government in Baghdad. What he might do if that fails he did not say. And while aides stressed this is a narrow mission, they acknowledged scenarios in which it could expand.\" Reversal: \"The return to military engagement in Iraq is a reversal for Mr. Obama, whose early opposition to the war that toppled Saddam Hussein, and his promise to end it, fueled his long-shot campaign for the White House,\" write Carol E. Lee and Felicia Schwartz at the Wall Street Journal. \"It also puts a spotlight on what has become a familiar feature of the Obama presidency, in which the leader of the most powerful military in the world has become defined by his reluctance to use it.\" Unity after all? \"Ironically, ISIS's campaign against the Kurds may end up helping unify the Iraqi state,\" writes Joshua Keating at Slate. The Kurds have long been at odds with Nouri al-Maliki's government, but now he's ordering his air force to help them. \"Iraq\u2019s various factions, as well as Baghdad\u2019s odd-couple patrons, Iran and the United States, may be forced to work together to confront the most serious threat the country has faced since the worst days of the Iraq war.\" Full text: Read the president's statement here.",

The 25-year-old woman, who worked in Brazil, had an abortion at 32 weeks gestation after an ultrasound showed the fetus was abnormally small, with no brain folds and calcium buildups in the brain and brain circumference below the second percentile for fetal weight, NPR reports. \"This is the critical point,\" the director of the Center for Emerging and Infectious Diseases at Johns Hopkins tells NPR. \"You have a mother who's infected, a fetus that's abnormal, and in the fetal, you have the genetic signature of the virus. This is clear data showing Zika can infect the fetus.\" Zika has been linked to microcephaly, a condition in which a baby's head and brain are underdeveloped. In Brazil, more than 5,600 cases of Zika have been reported in pregnant women and their babies since October. The birth of the baby girl in Slovenia is the first known case of microcephaly caused by Zika in a woman who was not infected during her pregnancy. Researchers are trying to determine whether Zika can cause fetal abnormalities. \"It's quite a challenge to figure out what happens,\" a University of Texas pathologist tells NBC.",

The study centers on a 25-year-old Slovenian woman who became pregnant while volunteering in Brazil in February 2015. She developed a high fever and rash during her 13th week of pregnancy, but ultrasounds at 14 and 20 weeks showed no issues. When she returned to Slovenia in October, however, doctors found extensive brain damage in the fetus and the pregnancy was aborted, per NBC News. An autopsy found the full genome of the Zika virus exclusively in the fetus' unusually smooth and scarred brain, suggesting the virus only attacked nerve tissue, per Reuters. The mother had no family history of genetic abnormalities and the fetus tested negative for 13 other viruses known to cause birth defects. \"You have a mother who's infected, a fetus that's abnormal, and in the fetus, you have the genetic signature of the virus,\" says an infectious disease expert. \"This is clear data showing Zika can infect the fetus.\" An epidemiologist adds \"it sounds like a pretty clear case of extreme microcephaly.\" Scientists suspect brain development may have stopped around 20 weeks, leading one doctor to suggest that Zika, like other viruses linked to birth defects, may be most dangerous in the early stages of pregnancy.

Scicchitano spoke at preliminary hearing at a courthouse near campus that will determine if there's enough evidence to send the case to court for trial. Video shot inside the Beta Theta Pi house was being shown from the night the pledge was ordered to drink and then fatally injured in a series of falls. The Post-Gazette notes that this is the first time prosecutors showed the video. Piazza consumed what prosecutors said was a life-threatening amount of alcohol during a hazing ritual on Feb. 2 and he died two days later. Fraternity members didn't call 911 until nearly 12 hours after his first fall. Piazza's father, Jim, rocked back and forth quietly in the front row of the courtroom as he heard his son's final hours described. When the video started, he and his wife Evelyn left the courtroom. \"The grand jury presentment released last month had described what was on the video in detail, but still it was no match for the actual footage,\" the Post-Gazette notes. The defendants face a variety of charges, with some accused of involuntary manslaughter and felony aggravated assault. Piazza died at a hospital Feb. 4 from traumatic brain injury and had suffered severe abdominal bleeding. His blood-alcohol measured at a dangerous level. Penn State has permanently banned the fraternity, saying the school found \"a persistent pattern\" of excess drinking, drug use, and hazing.",

Gammy's biological father, however, says he didn't know that his daughter had a twin and that he took only Gammy when he went to take his other daughter home to Western Australia.

The baby, now 7 months old, was allegedly abandoned by his Australian parents, who paid a 21-year-old Thai woman to be a surrogate mother following an IVF procedure that ultimately resulted in twins. But the Australian couple says they were never told about the second baby, though surrogate Pattaramon Chanbua, a street vendor with two young children of her own, thinks they're lying about that. She says she was asked to abort Gammy but refused due to religious beliefs, and she's now raising him\u2014and she wants to raise his twin sister as well after new allegations arose against the couple who took her and left Gammy behind. Sources tell Australia's 9 News that the father is a pedophile who was jailed in the 1990s on child sex convictions; his wife says she's aware of those convictions but that her husband is a changed man. The AP also spoke to a police officer who says the man is a convicted sex offender. Child protective services is reportedly looking into the father's suitability now, and Chanbua says she'd take the baby girl she carried back. As for whether she'd turn Gammy over to the couple at this point, she says, \"Never. Not in any way.\" He's currently in the hospital with a serious lung infection and will need surgery for a heart problem, reports the Guardian. A GoFundMe campaign started by a charity has raised more than $230,000 for Gammy's care, and some have argued that Gammy should be able to access Australia's health care.
