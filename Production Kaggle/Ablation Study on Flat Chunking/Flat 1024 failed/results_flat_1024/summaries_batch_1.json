Peter King, who as head of the House Homeland Security Committee, has been briefed. The agents, part of an advance team that was supposed to secure President Obama's hotel, were caught with prostitutes in their hotel rooms, and the dispute caused a disturbance that got local police involved. \u201cNumber one, it is against basic ethics to go to a prostitute. Number two, it is incredibly embarrassing to the White House,\u201d says one insider, who added that the agents' careers are probably over. \u201cYes, doubly good judgment there.\u201d Eleven agents have been placed on leave in the incident, notes the AP, and another five military personnel have been accused of similar misconduct after violating curfew. None of the Secret Service agents involved were directly responsible for Obama's protection. A Secret Service rep has apologized \"for any distraction.\"",

Joplin was flown to a hospital in Nebraska, while the other three were treated locally and released. Politico reports that Carson, who was in South Carolina at the time, flew to Nebraska when he heard the news and paid for a private jet to bring Joplin's family out from Texas. \"One of the precious few joys of campaigning is the privilege of meeting bright young men and women who are so enthusiastic about their country that they will freely give of their time and energy to work on its behalf,\" Carson said in a statement. \"America lost one of those bright young men today. I had the privilege of knowing Braden Joplin personally, and am filled with a deep and profound sadness at his passing.\" Other candidates, including Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton, tweeted their condolences, while Bernie Sanders mentioned Joplin at the start of a rally in Iowa City, the AP reports. \"I have a lot of respect for any young person who gets involved in the political process,\" Sanders said. \"Our hearts go out to the family of the young man.\"",

Just days after Alphabet officially became Google's holding company, it scooped up a brand-new domain name: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.com, which has been around since 1999 and was purchased for an unspecified amount, NBC News reports. The page isn't functional as of this post, and a company rep says, \"We realized we missed a few letters in abc.xyz, so we're just being thorough.\" (Google set up that website in August.) It's hard to imagine Google directing the general public to use the site\u2014would you want to type in all those letters every time?\u2014and NBC notes the domain purchase may simply be a preemptive strike to keep others from usurping it for their own use. Two domains the company probably won't be able to get its hands on: ABC.com (for the American Broadcasting Company, owned by Disney) and alphabet.com, which BMW is unlikely to give up, notes Consumerist. If you'd been hoping to nab the domain for yourself, you can always try to cybersquat the site away when Google's hold on it expires in August 2018.

The New York City woman, who's suing Sean for $127,000, testified in court Friday that when she arrived at her nephew's birthday party in Westport, Conn., on March 28, 2011, Sean was riding his brand-new bike outside. When he saw Connell, she said, he ran toward her yelling, \"Auntie Jen, Auntie Jen!\" and then flung his 50-pound body at her, knocking them both to the ground and breaking her wrist. \"I remember him shouting, 'Auntie Jen, I love you,' and there he was flying at me,\" she testified. Connell told the jury she didn't complain about her injury at the time because \"it was his birthday party and I didn't want to upset him,\" but she noted that the broken wrist upended her busy life. \"I live in Manhattan in a third-floor walk-up, so it has been very difficult,\" she said. \"And we all know how crowded it is in Manhattan.\" Not to mention how it affected her in social situations: \"I was at a party recently, and it was difficult to hold my hors d'oeuvre plate,\" she noted. Even though Connell says Sean\u2014who the Post notes listened with his dad to his aunt's testimony looking \"confused\"; his mom died last year\u2014has always been \"very loving\" and \"sensitive\" toward her, she thinks he should still be liable and understand that his actions have consequences.

Experts say that many more states will soon follow. Although some sites like True.com insist on background checks for all members, other dating sites say this is a false sense of security because criminal screening databases are imperfect.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The Supreme Court heard oral arguments yesterday in ABC v. Aereo, a much-watched case that could have big implications for both cloud computing and broadcast television\u2014implications the justices didn't seem comfortable with. Aereo allows users to record broadcast TV online and watch it at their leisure. The major broadcast networks are suing it for copyright violation, and stand to lose billions in fees cable companies pay to carry their programming. Aereo says it's simply renting users the equipment to do online what they can legally do at home. Here's how the arguments went: \"If you're comfortable with the Supreme Court resolving disputes over technology, the transcript of Tuesday's oral arguments \u2026 should change your mind,\" writes Jon Healey at the LA Times. Stephen Breyer at one point made an analogy to \"what used to be called a phonograph record store.\" He also worried that Aereo's antennas could \"pick up every television signal in the world,\" which isn't true, Healey pointed out, \"because the world isn't, you know, flat.\" The justices seemed skeptical of Aereo's business model. \"It's not logical to me that you can make these millions of copies and essentially sell them to the public,\" Sonia Sotomayor said. John Roberts said the company was only using thousands of small antennas, instead of a few big ones \"to get around copyright laws,\" the Wall Street Journal reports. But the justices also seemed genuinely worried that their decision could stifle innovation. Sotomayor asked what effect this would have on \"the Dropbox and the iCloud.\" When the broadcasters' lawyers told them to \"just be confident\" that Aereo's service was different, Samuel Alito said, \"I don't find that very satisfying. \u2026 I need to understand what effect it will have on these other technologies.\" Aereo's best hope is that the justices adhere to a lower court's Cartoon Network vs. Cablevision ruling, which held that customers could make DVR recordings on Cablevision's hard drives, writes Lyle Denniston at SCOTUSblog. At one point, Anthony Kennedy suggested lawyers pretend that decision had come from the high court. Ultimately, the justices didn't seem to like their options. \"This is really hard for me,\" Sotomayor confessed. \"I don't see how to get out of it,\" Breyer agreed.",

But Mike Allen of Axios reports on another strategy being explored by the president's legal team: Appoint a second special counsel to investigate Mueller's investigation. The story suggests that Trump's attorneys trust Mueller himself but not others in the Justice Department. For example, they point to a Fox News story Monday detailing how the wife of a Justice Department official named Bruce Ohr worked for the company behind the infamous anti-Trump dossier that emerged during the election. Ohr was recently demoted for concealing his own meetings with the company, Fusion GPS. \"The Department of Justice and FBI cannot ignore the multiple problems that have been created by these obvious conflicts of interests,\" Trump attorney Jay Sekulow tells Axios. \"These new revelations require the appointment of a special counsel to investigate.\" It's not clear how likely this is to happen, but Attorney General Jeff Sessions has previously floated the idea of a second special counsel to cover a wide range of GOP concerns. Meanwhile, the Washington Post has a profile of Trump's legal trio: Sekulow (the TV presence), Ty Cobb (a White House attorney), and John Dowd (Trump's personal attorney). They \"serve not only as Trump's lawyers but also as his strategists, publicists, therapists\u2014and, based on Dowd's claim that he wrote a controversial presidential tweet, ghostwriters,\" per the Post.",

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 As Australia mourns two hostages killed in a Sydney cafe yesterday, many are wondering what gunman Man Haron Monis was doing on the streets in the first place. The Iranian-born cleric, who was killed when police commandos stormed the cafe, was on bail for around 50 counts of sexual and indecent assault and for charges of being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife. The 31-year-old mother of two was stabbed repeatedly and set on fire with the use of lighter fluid last April, allegedly by Monis' girlfriend. The crime happened in an apartment stairwell. More: Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott says the government will look into why the 50-year-old was out on bail and why he did not appear on the country's terrorist watch list, the BBC reports. \"How can someone who has had such a long and checkered history not be on the appropriate watch lists, and how can someone like that be entirely at large in the community?\" he wondered at a press conference today. \"These are questions that we need to look at carefully and calmly and methodically.\" Just three days before he walked into the cafe with a gun and took 17 people hostage, Monis had failed in an attempt to overturn a conviction for sending \"grossly offensive\" letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. The country's High Court rejected his application to hear a fresh constitutional challenge to the charges against him, for which he was sentenced to 300 hours of community service. Monis, who declared himself to be a sheikh and a \"spiritual healer,\" was seen as a \"fringe figure\" in Sydney's Islamic community, according to a Guardian profile. Shia Muslim leaders had asked police to probe his claims to be a leading cleric and last week, he announced on his website that he had converted to Sunni Islam and pledged allegiance to ISIS. The lawyer who represented Monis in the murder case tells the Australian Broadcasting Company that his client, who came to the country as a refugee in 1996, may have thought he had \"nothing to lose,\" hence \"participating in something as desperate and outrageous as this.\" He says that while in prison, Monis suffered some \"very unpleasant events, involving matters of excrement over himself and his cell,\" and he is certain that the siege was the act of a \"one-off random individual,\" not an organized terrorist group.",

City and county officials and employees honking for almost 10 years as they drive by to get back at you for placing a bid on a house: not so cool.

Why Krlich says he's the object of retaliation: In 2007, he tried to buy at an auction a neighboring property that for nearly a century had been in the family of the town's fire chief at the time. Krlich says when he put in the highest offer, then-Fire Chief John Clemente Jr. told him he'd better take it back or risk being \"bitter enemies.\" Krlich kept his bid in, though for unspecified reasons, the property \"did not pass to him as it should have\"\u2014and, he says, the harassment started anyway. Described on the Krlich.com website (subtitled \"Small Town Terrorism\") as \"undeserved, uninterrupted, unyielding spite,\" the subsequent actions Krlich says have been directed toward him\u2014the relentless honking, an unsympathetic police department, a 911 service that hangs up on him\u2014have been carried out by various Hubbard firefighters driving city trucks, members of Police Chief James Taafe's family, city councilmen, and others, per the suit. In a 2014 20/20 interview, Krlich says the honking peaked at 100 times a day (it's since died down to just a couple per day); Clemente and his wife noted in the same interview that Krlich was simply litigious. \"If you beep your horn one time, he'll take you to court,\" Marlene Clemente said.",

But \"we need to continue (searching) for several days right up to the point at which there's absolutely no doubt that the batteries will have expired,\" says Angus Houston, the Australian official leading the search, per CBS News. \"If we don't get any further transmissions, we have a reasonably large search area of the bottom of the ocean to prosecute and that will take a long, long time,\" Houston says. The ship is carrying an autonomous underwater vehicle that can search the depths for the plane, \"literally crawling along the bottom of the ocean,\" Houston notes. Trouble is, findings so far point to \"a large area for a small submersible that has a very narrow field of search.\" Once the vehicle, called Bluefin-21, does head downward, it will conduct 20-hour sonar missions to try to find the plane.",

There's no evidence doctors were complicit in the reported counterfeiting, but plenty of them used the screws.

Other companies' logos were also falsified on the screws.

For example, the system \"needs to take no more than five minutes [to set up]\" as an astronaut might be forced to jump into their suit quickly in an emergency, per Space.com.

Abbott, the medical device company that produces implantable cardiac pacemakers under the St. Jude\u2019s Medical brand, has issued a \"corrective action,\" per the Food and Drug Administration, to mitigate what it calls the \"risk of patient harm due to potential exploitation of cybersecurity vulnerabilities.\" That's right, it's asking 465,000 people with certain devices to visit their doctors and get a firmware update so that their implants are not so easy to hack into. They say patients should schedule a visit with their doctor, and that the process will take three minutes start to finish, during which time all essential features will run in backup mode, reports Consumerist. It's unclear how many people in other countries are affected. Over the past decade, there's been an increase in reports of serious vulnerabilities in pacemakers, insulin pumps, and other medical devices, reports Ars Technica. That's because they're now outfitted with tiny radio-frequency equipment for remote maintenance that no longer requires new and costly surgeries when the devices need updating. Back in May, Engadget reported that security company WhiteScope found 8,000 bugs hackers could exploit in pacemaker programs alone. While attackers must be within 50 feet of the device to hack into it, and no one has yet to die from a cyber attack, some argue that the mere threat of an attack is reason enough to make these devices as sophisticated and protected as possible. (One pacemaker was used in an arson investigation.)",

Austin Pledger, from Thorsby, Ala., was first prescribed Risperdal, manufactured by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, in 2002 when he was 8; at the time, the drug wasn't FDA-approved for kids, and its label said risk was \"low\" for gynecomastia (the condition in which men's breasts grow larger), Thomas Kline, one of Pledger's attorneys, tells the Daily News. But when the FDA gave the green light in 2006 for the drug to be used as a schizophrenic aid for kids, new labels said the drug contained high levels of the hormone prolactin, which spurs breast growth, Kline adds. Pledger had started growing breasts by then\u2014and now, the only way he can get rid of them is through a mastectomy, Kline says. A Janssen spokeswoman sent a statement to People noting the company is \"disappointed\" in the decision and that the drug's side effects were clearly spelled out for Pledger's family and prescribing physician. The spokeswoman also argued that Pledger's \"quality of life was significantly improved during the time he was taking Risperdal,\" per the Daily News. But Stephen Sheller, another Pledger attorney, says \"there was grave mistreatment of children\" and that Johnson & Johnson \"hid data from the FDA, prescribing doctors, and parents.

Still waiting to be settled in the Philly court system: more than 1,200 other cases against Risperdal, says Kline.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Should sending your kid to play alone at a local park land you in jail? Because that's what happened to Debra Harrell. The 46-year-old South Carolina mom repeatedly sent her 9-year-old daughter to a well-trafficked park while she went to work at McDonald's. When the parents of other children at the park found out, they called police, who arrested Harrell and charged her with unlawful conduct toward a child. The daughter has been placed in state custody. Local news outlets first reported the story on July 1, but it's been getting wider attention lately thanks to an indignant post on Reason from \"Free Range Kids\" advocate Lenore Skenazy. And so far, pretty much everyone agrees that the arrest is senseless and wrong. Some reactions: Skenazy notes that the original news reports make it sound like Harrell \"committed a serious, unconscionable crime,\" as locals speculate that the girl could have been kidnapped. \"To which I must ask: In broad daylight? In a crowded park? Just because something happened on Law & Order doesn't mean it's happening all the time in real life.\" \"Since I'm a parent, Harrell\u2019s arrest scares me: How can I appropriately parent my child when doing something that seems relatively safe, if out of fashion, can get you arrested?\" asks Jessica Grose at Slate. One law professor tells Grose that the statutes for child welfare laws are often broadly written, giving police lots of latitude\u2014and allowing \"race, class, and gender biases to influence decisions.\" That could be the case here, because Harrell is black, and her poverty helped cause the situation. \"The story is a convergence of helicopter parenting with America\u2019s primitive family policy,\" writes Jonathan Chait at New York. \"Our welfare policy is designed to make everybody, even single mothers, work full-time jobs. The social safety net makes it difficult for low-wage single mothers to obtain adequate child care. And society is seized by bizarre fears that children are routinely snatched up by strangers in public places,\" which is actually an exceedingly rare phenomenon. \"The state has caused the child far more trauma than she was ever likely to suffer in the park,\" writes Conor Friedersdorf at the Atlantic, and they're taking the child at a time when the state has a shortage of foster families. And there's no empirical evidence saying the child would be safer, say, sitting at McDonald's. \"The actual safety of a given kid is not being rigorously determined. State employees are drawing on their prejudices to make somewhat arbitrary judgment calls.\"",

The Senate majority leader had to surrender on ObamaCare repeal, ally Bob Corker announced he was retiring, and, perhaps worst of all, the Senate candidate that McConnell strongly backed in Alabama got trounced by one backed by the Steve Bannon contingent. Just how bad is it for McConnell? Here's a look at coverage: Mocked by Trump: The president has taken to doing physical impressions of a slump-shouldered McConnell, reports Axios. Trump also reportedly called out McConnell as \"weak\" at a dinner with conservative activists, reports Politico.

No immediate danger: Both Politico and the Times say McConnell retains rock-solid support in the Republican Conference and thus is not in any immediate peril. Much of that support is based on his formidable fundraising skills on behalf of Senate Republicans. Beware the midterms: In a piece subtitled, \"Is the Senate Leader Losing His Grip on the GOP?,\" Abigail Tracy at Vanity Fair notes that midterm elections in general are often unkind to the party in power: \"With the GOP in the midst of an ideological schism, McConnell\u2019s faction could be headed for a reckoning.\" Indeed, Tuesday's triple whammy \"just shows how weak the Republican establishment is right now,\" writes Harry Enten at FiveThirtyEight.

McConnell is willing to take all the criticism coming from conservatives over the ObamaCare fail, especially if it protects rank-and-file Republicans, per an analysis at the Washington Post. \"But one thing that could hamper McConnell\u2019s long-term standing would be if he became a real albatross to his own incumbents in primary elections ahead,\" writes Paul Kane. Fear of that played a role in John Boehner's resignation as House speaker two years ago. False narrative: Many in the media are portraying the Alabama results as a loss for Trump, but winner Roy Moore is decidedly Trumpian, writes Erick Erickson at the Resurgent.

The children ranged in age from 12 to 19; their parents were under investigation for alleged abuse or neglect at the time of the crash. Investigators have also been interviewing neighbors, searching the family's Washington home, and looking into cellphone pings. So far, they know the family was south of Portland by 8:15am March 24, and then drove south along the coast until, by 8pm, they were in the Fort Bragg area. They were there a little more than 24 hours, then headed north up the coast. Their GMC Yukon went off the cliff, falling 70 feet to an embankment below, on March 26; a passerby reported it to police around 3:30pm. Authorities say it appeared to have accelerated over the edge and that no skid marks were found near where it went over. \"As of this date it is still unclear if the missing children were inside the vehicle during the incident,\" the CHP said in a news release, but the missing children are tentatively presumed dead. The local sheriff tells KOIN there is \"every indication\" they were in the car when it crashed. (A former friend of the couple has come forward to speak out about the alleged abuse.)",

For 18-year-old Adrianne Lewis, making YouTube videos showing off the various tricks she can do with her estimated 4-inch-long tongue seemed like a great way to gain some Internet fame. The Michigan teen uploaded her first video two years ago. Since then, she's uploaded about a dozen videos showing off all she can do with her quirky mouth feature, including licking her nose, touching her tongue to her elbow, and, with a little help from her hand, even licking her own eyeball. Speaking to Barcroft TV, her mom says they realized Lewis' tongue was unusually long when she was about 10, and notes that her daughter comes from a long line of long-tongued people: Her great-grandfather, grandmother, and mother share the trait. While Lewis is psyched about the hundreds of thousands of views her YouTube videos have amassed, boyfriend Tim Hegedus notes, \"It's the Internet, so there's a lot of weird people there. I've seen some comments that make me uncomfortable.\" More fame could come: The length of Lewis' tongue might just be enough to get her into Guinness World Records. While she hasn't had it officially measured by the Guinness folks, she estimates her tongue measures at least 4 inches, which Mashable reports could be enough to beat the 3.97-inch-long tongue (as measured \"from its tip to the middle of the closed top lip\") currently holding the record.",

Tannerite is a product typically used for target practice; it is placed on targets and explodes when struck by a bullet from a high-powered rifle. It's sold in two inert parts (ammonium nitrate and aluminum powder), neither of which is regulated by the ATF. Once those two parts are mixed together, it only explodes if a bullet hits it and is considered very stable, a corporate investigator for Tannerite says. Tannerite residue was found inside the bomb that exploded in Chelsea, a federal law enforcement official tells USA Today. A post on the company's Facebook page Monday reads, \"The entire staff of Tannerite stands together in the abhorrence and unintended use of all products that are misused for violence and hate.\" It goes on to note that its investigator is working to verify that Tannerite was indeed used in the bomb. A former FBI agent tells CBS News Tannerite appears to be \"on the defensive.\" \"It\u2019s just something we have to be aware of that these terrorists are very clever at finding out what components can come together and make an improvised exploding device,\" he says.

The plans to deploy the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD, within this year have angered not only North Korea, but also China and Russia, which see the system's powerful radars as a security threat, the AP reports. China firmly opposes the deployment and it responded quickly, saying it will take \"necessary measures\" to protect itself and warning that the US and South Korea should be prepared to bear the consequences. Washington and Seoul say the system is defensive and not meant to be a threat to Beijing or Moscow. The US military said in a statement that THAAD can intercept and destroy short and medium range ballistic missiles during the last part of their flights. \"Continued provocative actions by North Korea, to include yesterday's launch of multiple missiles, only confirm the prudence of our alliance decision last year to deploy THAAD to South Korea,\" Adm. Harry Harris, head of the US Pacific Command, said in the statement.

In front of a rowdy crowd, real Nobel winners handed out the awards to those who had the year's oddest research. Winners also received $10 trillion\u2014in a single Zimbabwean banknote (US value: less than $1). Some highlights from the annual ceremony at Harvard University, which was presented by the Annals of Improbable Research: \"Goat man\" Tom Thwaites wore his goat legs to the awards ceremony .He tells the BBC that he gained a \"goat buddy\" during his time in the Alps\u2014but there were some tense moments. \"I was just sort of walking around, you know, chewing grass, and just looked up and then suddenly realized that everyone else had stopped chewing and there was this tension which I hadn't kind of noticed before and then one or two of the goats started tossing their horns around and I think I was about to get in a fight,\" he says. Thwaites shared the biology prize with Charles Foster, another Brit who has spent time living in the wild as, among other things, a badger, an otter, and a fox. Science reports that the medicine prize went to a team of neurologists and psychologists, who, with the help of video cameras, mirrors, and volunteers injected with a chemical that causes a mild itch, discovered that scratching the left side of your body will relieve an itch on the right side if you're looking in a mirror at the time. A Japanese team won the perception prize with a study published as \"Perceived Size and Perceived Distance of Targets Viewed From Between the Legs: Evidence for Proprioceptive Theory.\" Their research involved bending over and looking at things from between their legs to see if they looked any different. Egyptian urologist Ahmed Shafik was posthumously awarded the reproduction prize for his research on how wearing trousers of polyester, cotton, or wool affected the sex lives of rats.

Kirsten Hatfield disappeared from her bedroom in Midwest City on the night of May 14, 1997, and Anthony Palma, who lived two houses away, was arrested this week on charges of kidnapping and first-degree murder, KOCO reports. The breakthrough in the cold case came after a new investigator took over in June and discovered that key pieces of evidence\u2014including bloodstains on the girl's bedroom window sill and on her underwear, found in her backyard\u2014were never tested for DNA, reports NBC News. Palma, who was released from prison in 1986 after serving time for assault with a dangerous weapon, still lives in the same home, and an arrest warrant states that he probably stayed there \"to conceal evidence of the crime and/or the location of [Kirsten's] body,\" reports NBC. Fox 25 reports that the 56-year-old was interviewed after the 1997 disappearance and provided a DNA sample this year when investigators finally tested the evidence and spoke to 10 suspects in the case. Court documents state that the DNA match to the evidence was 293 sextillion to 1. Police believe Palma targeted the girl for sexual assault and killed her soon after her abduction, reports KOCO. Her body has never been found. (A woman thought to have been murdered in 1984 was found alive and well in Dusseldorf.)",

In 2003, the CIA abducted Egyptian cleric and terror suspect Osama Mustafa Hassan Nasr from Milan, Italy, under its \"extraordinary rendition\" program. Nasr says he was transferred to Egypt, where he was tortured. At the time, Sabrina de Sousa was working undercover for the CIA in Italy but tells NPR she was 150 miles away on a ski trip with her son during the week Nasr was kidnapped. Nevertheless, de Sousa was one of 26 Americans convicted of violating Italian law by abducting Nasr. She faces four years in prison, the Guardian reports. De Sousa has been living in Portugal and fighting extradition\u2014without any apparent help from the US government. \"The US government won't intervene because they don't want me implicating anyone else as I try to counter the charges against me,\" de Sousa tells ABC. She says she feels \"abandoned and betrayed\" by her own country. De Sousa appealed her extradition to Portugal's highest court but lost that appeal Wednesday. She believes her next stop is an Italian prison and has asked Pope Francis for help. In a strange twist, while the US government isn't speaking up for de Sousa, the man she is said to have helped kidnap is. \u201cThe US administration sacrificed them,\" Nasr tells the Guardian. \"All of those higher up in the hierarchy are enjoying their immunity.\" He says de Sousa is a \"scapegoat.\" So far, none of the 26 Americans convicted by Italy have seen jail time.",

The global chemical weapons watchdog has been testing the nerve agent used to poison the Skripals in the UK. CBS News reports the four suspects, which included an IT expert, were caught \"in flagrante\" on April 13 and immediately removed from the country. The men were allegedly trying to hack into the OPCW via its WiFi network, reports the Guardian, supposedly after a spear-phishing attack launched from Russia failed. The trunk of their rental car, which was parked outside the OPCW's HQ, reportedly contained computer equipment designed to intercept log-ins. One of the men allegedly tried to trash his cell phone upon being confronted by authorities, reports the BBC, but officials say plenty of damning evidence was recovered, including an antenna concealed under a coat and a taxi receipt for a trip from a street near the GRU's Moscow location to the airport. British ambassador to the Netherlands Peter Wilson, who was present for the announcement, said a seized laptop's history indicated it was part of previous hacks: in Malaysia in association with the investigation into the downing of flight MH-17 over the Ukraine in 2014, and in Lausanne, Switzerland, in connection with the World Anti-Doping Agency, which has investigated doping by Russian athletes.

The Guardian reports thieves drilled into a cellar belonging to an apartment near Luxembourg Gardens and stole more than 300 bottles of vintage wine. The wine is said to be worth between $595 and $1,200 per bottle, according to the Telegraph. \"We're talking about very, very good wine,\" a spokesperson for the local prosecutor says.

The International Business Times reports the thieves are still at large, and police are offering few details on their investigation. The specific wine stolen has also not been revealed, according to Decanter. With approximately 150 miles of tunnels comprising the catacombs, police believe the thieves knew exactly what cellar they wanted and where it was located. \"One can assume that they had made reconnaissance missions and that the criminals didn't drill through this wall by chance,\" the Telegraph quotes a police source as saying.

Plus, a notice about a possible rule change for the program says US citizens \"may be required to provide photographs upon entering or departing the United States.\" They are also concerned about how any data gleaned from the facial scans will be used, and some are raising concerns about the possibility someone will be mistakenly barred from boarding a flight. \"We're not talking about one gate,\" says one privacy expert. \"We're talking about every international departure gate, which is a huge expansion of the number of people who will be scanned.

Police say Ancona's body was driven away in Jinkerson's vehicle and dumped. They say Malissa Ancona confessed to that scenario, and told police she helped to clean up and try to hide what happened. Police found \"extensive blood evidence\" in the master bedroom of the couple's Leadwood home. Ancona and Jinkerson have been charged with first-degree murder, tampering with physical evidence, and abandonment of a corpse. The body of Ancona, who was reported missing by his employer last week, was found Saturday. The coroner also revealed Monday that Ancona, who identified himself as a KKK imperial wizard, was shot in the head with a shotgun-like weapon at close range and did not have any other bullet wounds on his body, Time reports. Authorities have not speculated publicly on a motive. When police searched the Anconas' home, they found a broken-open safe and discovered Frank Ancona's guns were missing. Malissa Ancona, who was at the home with Jinkerson when police came to search it, per the Daily Journal, claimed her husband had taken them, and that he planned to file for divorce when he got back from his trip. But his family says he wouldn't have taken all his guns with him, and the gun he typically did carry on a daily basis was still at the house.

On Thursday, that court order was overturned in a unanimous decision by the California Supreme Court that animal activists are decrying. A Los Angeles County Superior Court judge issued the injunction against the zoo in 2012 in response to a taxpayer lawsuit alleging animal cruelty. But in what the Los Angeles Times calls a \"highly technical ruling\" overturning the injunction, the state's highest court said a taxpayer lawsuit (which uses civil law rules) can't be used to address criminal conduct. The taxpayer lawsuit began in 2007 when an LA resident sued over what he said was abusive treatment of the elephants, also including the use of chains and drugs, Courthouse News Service reports. A lawyer who worked on the case, for free, for more than five years says he'll attempt to find another way to get a similar injunction against the zoo, or request that the state legislature overturn the ruling. \"I thought we had done something here to move the ball forward and instead the Supreme Court has allowed the zoo to take a step into the Dark Ages,\" he says. The Supreme Court explained in its ruling that by obtaining the injunction in such a way, the court did not allow the zoo to have a jury trial or the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The barbed sticks known as bull hooks have since been banned entirely in California, and for its part, the zoo says that it has never used and will never use them or electric shocks as disciplinary tools for its elephants, and that it will continue to follow the court order despite it being overturned.",

In 1985, there were between 152,000 and 163,000 giraffes, but that number dropped to 97,000 by 2015\u2014a \"devastating decline\" of nearly 40% that now moves the animal from the \"least concern\" category into the \"vulnerable\" one on the group's Red List. \"While there [has] been great concern about elephants and rhinos, giraffes have gone under the radar,\" says Dr. Fennessy, co-director of the IUCN's Giraffe Conservation arm. The updated Red List, released Thursday at a biological diversity conference in Cancun, Mexico, points to man as the main driver of the declining stats, with poaching, habitat loss, and local unrest all assuming partial blame. A Duke University conservation biologist says the IUCN is partly to blame, too, for not considering more species threatened. \"There's a strong tendency to think that familiar species [such as giraffes, chimps, etc.] must be OK because ... we see them in zoos,\" he tells the AP. \"This is dangerous.\" Some good news, at least for some long-neckers: Of the nine giraffe subspecies, three of them are experiencing increasing populations; one is stable.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 San Francisco's city attorney wants Monster Beverage to cut down on both the caffeine in its energy drinks and the marketing of them, and the company is fighting back in federal court. Monster sued the office of Dennis Herrera this week, arguing that its drinks are no more harmful than a cup of Starbucks coffee and making the case that only the FDA can regulate the market, reports the Wall Street Journal. One thing in particular that irritates Herrera is that the company has a Monster Army website for kids that shows an 11-year-old \"Monster Army Major\" and a 6-year-old \"Reserve,\" reports the San Francisco Chronicle. So, yes, the energy drinks have less caffeine than a cup at Starbucks, but the coffee chain \"isn\u2019t marketing sweet drinks that are highly caffeinated to young people,\u201d says a Herrera spokesperson. The legal fight comes amid heightened scrutiny of energy drinks not only by the FDA but by New York state in particular.",

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Conspiracy theorists, take a deep breath: A Texas judge has officially deemed Antonin Scalia's death a natural one, WFAA reports. Presidio County Judge Cinderela Guevara says the Supreme Court justice died of a heart attack. Guevara says she heard about Scalia's death from a sheriff, and was planning to travel to the luxury ranch where Scalia died, when a US Marshal called her. \"It's not necessary for you to come, judge. If you\u2019re asking for an autopsy, that\u2019s what we need to clarify,\" the marshal told her, per Guevara. She goes on: \"As part of my investigation, one of the things I did ask the sheriff and the US Marshal: 'Were there any signs of foul play?' And they said, \u2018Absolutely not.\u2019 At that time, I still wanted to be careful, and asked them if [Scalia\u2019s] physician would call me.\" Scalia's doctor did call her Saturday night, saying Scalia had a shoulder injury and several chronic health issues. Guevara decided the death was natural and no autopsy would be needed, ABC News reports. Meanwhile, Scalia's body was transported overnight by van\u2014with a procession of US Marshals Service vehicles and Texas Dept. of Public Safety troopers\u2014to Sunset Funeral Home in El Paso. The funeral home manager says Scalia's remains were embalmed, a legal requirement before moving a body out of the state. The leading conspiracy theory was that President Obama himself had Scalia murdered, a notion the New Republic puts down to \"some paranoid people on Twitter.\"",

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 President Trump's social media chief had to post a retraction Sunday after sharing a video that he wrongly believed showed the impact of Hurricane Irma. \"Here is Miami International Airport. STAY SAFE!!\" tweeted White House social media director Dan Scavino, posting a video of flooding at an airport. He was swiftly corrected by Miami International Airport itself, which pointed out that the video was not from the airport, CNN reports. The real location and date of the video has not been verified, though it was posted on YouTube on Aug. 31 with a title suggesting that it is Mexico City's airport. It resurfaced on Twitter Sunday mislabeled as Miami. \"It was among 100s of videos/pix I am receiving,\" Scavino tweeted after being corrected. \"In trying to notify all, I shared - have deleted.\" The error was noteworthy because when Scavino shared the video, it was an example of the tweets he said he was sharing with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence hourly, raising questions about the accuracy of his information, the Washington Post reports. The White House declined to comment on how Scavino was verifying posts that he shared with Trump and Pence. Miami International Airport, meanwhile, says it will be closed until at least Tuesday while damage assessment is carried out. (Irma made landfall in Florida for a second time Sunday.)",

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 \"I was scared I was going to witness the death of this guy\": That's what one visitor had to say after a man decided to go skinny dipping with the sharks at Ripley's Aquarium of Canada. The man stripped down and then went over a security barrier and jumped, completely naked, into the Toronto aquarium's largest exhibit Friday night. It's called the \"Dangerous Lagoon,\" and a spokesperson for Toronto Police Service tells the CBC the man's stunt was, in fact, \"extremely dangerous\" to him, the marine animals in the tank, and the staff that tried to get him out of the water. The aquarium was open late at the time for its Friday Night Jazz program. Security personnel asked the swimmer to exit the water but he instead swam to the edge, got out, then did a backward flip right back in. \"The guy seemed totally relaxed and there were sharks like everywhere,\" the aforementioned witness notes. Eventually, the man did get out, put his clothes back on, and slipped into a crowd of onlookers. Security had called police, but the man was gone by the time they arrived; they are currently investigating the incident. They want to speak to the man, and the police rep says he could face charges including trespassing, mischief, and indecent exposure. The aquarium says it will press charges if the man is found, the Toronto Star reports. (This shark likes the taste of plants more than meat.)",

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 More than 2,500 mourners crowded Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church in St. Louis this morning to lay Michael Brown to rest, reports the AP, with another 2,000 in overflow seating and national television carrying the 18-year-old's funeral. Brown's casket was closed, with a St. Louis Cardinals cap atop it, notes the Post-Dispatch. His uncle, Bernard Ewing, recalled him as a \"big guy, but a kind, gentle soul\" in a service that the New York Times calls \"deeply religious.\" The overarching message was one of change, with Brown's family members urging mourners to vote, and the Rev. Al Sharpton saying, \"We are required to leave here today and change things. Michael Brown must be remembered for more than disturbances.\" Michael Brown Sr., wearing a tie bearing his son's image, had yesterday pleaded with protesters for \"a day of silence so I can, so we can, lay our son to rest.\" Other highlights: Among those gathered: Jesse Jackson, Martin Luther King III, Spike Lee, Rep. Maxine Waters, Rep. William Lacy Clay; family members of Trayvon Martin and Sean Bell; three White House representatives. Gov. Jay Nixon declined to attend \"out of respect for the family.\" Sharpton on protesters who turned to violence, as per CNN: \"Can you imagine, they're heartbroken, their son taken, discarded, and marginalized, and they have to stop mourning to get you to control your anger, like you're more angry than they are, like you don't understand that Michael Brown does not want to be remembered for a riot.\" The Rev. Charles Ewing, Brown's uncle who eulogized him: \"Michael Brown's blood is crying from the ground, crying for vengeance, crying for justice. There is a cry being made from the ground, not just for Michael Brown, but for the Trayvon Martins, for those children at Sandy Hook Elementary School, for the Columbine massacre, for the black-on-black crime.\"",
