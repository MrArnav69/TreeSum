Kasem and wife Jean were sued by a former caregiver who says Jean mistreated her, and the case was heard (and thrown out) yesterday. A rep who appeared on Jean's behalf revealed Kasem is dying, according to TMZ. Jean herself submitted legal documents that say Kasem \"is terminally ill and unable to leave home.\" TMZ has obtained other legal documents regarding Kasem this month; his kids say stepmom Jean has blocked them from seeing their father, and they're fighting her. Among the revelations: Kasem has advanced Parkinson's disease; may have early dementia and can only \"shuffle short distances\"; and suffers hallucinations and major impairment to his memory and ability to communicate, among other things.",

The 19-year-old male living in the Ashkelon area of Israel was arrested Thursday after a months-long investigation involving the FBI, Israeli police rep Micky Rosenfeld tells CNN. Police say the teen used neighbors' internet connections, voice manipulation, and other \"advanced camouflage technologies\" to hide his identity while making threats against Jewish centers in the US, Australia, and New Zealand, the New York Times reports, via Israel Radio. However, police believe he's also responsible for hundreds of other threats around the world over two or three years, reports Haaretz. Those include threats against shopping malls and airports. In one case, he forced a Delta flight to make an emergency landing, police say. Authorities say five computers, antennas, and other equipment were seized from his residence. Per Haaretz, the teen tried to grab the gun of an officer who arrived to arrest him; he was previously found unfit for military service in Israel. Police had previously said they were searching for a single individual believed to be behind the majority of more than 100 bomb threats made against Jewish centers in the US this year. \"This is the guy we are talking about,\" Rosenfeld says. The teen appeared in court on Thursday. (Federal officials have also traced some of the bomb threats to a jilted ex-boyfriend.)",

In other news from Pyongyang: The Telegraph lists some of the 24 charges against Jang, which apparently included \"gnawing at the unity and cohesion of the party\" and \"dreaming different dreams.\" He was also blamed for \"improper relations with several women\" and \"squandering foreign currency at casinos.\" But Pyongyang's claims that Jang was executed over his plans to seize power are likely inaccurate, says South Korea's head of intelligence: The real problem was Jang and his associates' push to take control of major business deals\u2014for instance, coal sales to China, the official said in a closed meeting, as noted by the New York Times. After Jang's rivals complained, Kim ordered Jang's associates to drop certain deals, but they refused; Kim believed his authority was being questioned.

A federal judge has ruled that Warner/Chappell, which has been making around $2 million a year from \"Happy Birthday to You,\" doesn't have the rights to the song and never did, reports the Los Angeles Times. The judge ruled that a copyright filed in 1935 and acquired by Warner in 1988 only covered specific piano arrangements of the tune and not the lyrics, the BBC reports. The song started out as \"Good Morning to All,\" written by a Kentucky schoolteacher and her sister in the 1890s, and the judge found that there was no evidence that the sisters had even written the better-known lyrics, Ars Technica reports. Warner wasn't in the habit of sending lawyers to raid birthday parties, but it did expect to get paid whenever the song was used in ads, movies, or any other profit-making enterprise.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Wonder what happened to iconic film directors like David Lynch, John Waters, and Francis Ford Coppola? Well, Hollywood checked the balance sheet and decided to stop making their kind of mid-budget films, Flavorwire reports. It's all dollars and cents: Thoughtful or offbeat films costing $5 million to $60 million can make moderate profits at best, while blockbusters with international appeal are able to bring in sick money. Paramount's Titanic made that point in 1997 by costing $200 million and earning nearly $2.2 billion worldwide. At that time, mid-budget films like Kiss the Girls and In & Out dominated the Paramount slate and drew modest profits; this year, mega-flicks like Transformers: Age of Extinction, Hercules, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles rule Paramount's roost and earn the big bucks. \"You could make movies in the ten-to-twenty-million-dollar budget range\" at one time, says Susan Seidelman, director of Desperately Seeking Susan. Now, she says, studios \"have to appeal to every demographic in every part of the world.\" And few seasoned directors want to test the indie market, where tons of under-$2 million films are vying for attention. So Spike Lee has funded a film via Kickstarter, Steven Soderbergh publicly quit feature filmmaking last year, and other directors are turning to TV for creative freedom. This sea-change has been coming for years now, as an old Forbes piece shows, but some\u2014including Steven Spielberg\u2014believe Hollywood will over-invest in blockbusters: \"There\u2019s going to be an implosion\" where several \"mega-budgeted movies are going to go crashing into the ground, and that\u2019s going to change the paradigm again,\" he says.",

Multiple phrases, including \"Ahab's lust for vengeance,\" appear both in SparkNotes and Dylan's talk, but not in Moby Dick itself. He had to give the talk to collect $922,000 in prize money. \"Some men who receive injuries are led to God, others are led to bitterness,\" a quote that one blogger thought Dylan had invented, appears to be based on SparkNotes. Pitzer suggests that Dylan donate some of the prize money to the SparkNotes writer, though others are more forgiving. University of Minnesota music professor Alex Lubet tells the Star-Tribune that Dylan's lecture shouldn't be treated like a classroom assignment. \"His lecture is wild and strange,\" Lubet says. \"It\u2019s meant to be a post-modern work of art.

Weeks after returning home, the 36-year-old noticed an itchy spot on the left side of her groin and assumed she'd been bitten by an insect, reports Live Science. Thinking it was an infected spider bite, her doctor fruitlessly prescribed antibiotics. Dr. Enrico Camporesi of Tampa's Memorial Hospital next took a look, noticing a hole in the center of the wound, which felt hard, as though something were inside. A surgeon suspected it was a living thing, and turned out to be right. Cutting open the lesion, doctors found a tapered human botfly larva with rows of spines and hooks meant to keep it buried in the woman's skin for up to 128 days, reports the Miami Herald. Commonly found in Central America, a human botfly first deposits her eggs on an insect, like a mosquito, which carries them to human or animal hosts. Injected in skin via bites, the egg hatches into larva that eventually drops from the skin and continues developing, eventually reaching the size of a large bumblebee, per the Journal of Investigative Medicine High Impact Case Reports. Though the botfly didn't reach the pupa stage in this case, it wasn't necessary for its human host to go under the knife. Belizeans cover lesions\u2014with petroleum jelly, nail polish, and even bacon strips, per the Herald\u2014to suffocate larvae, which emerge for air and can be removed with tweezers. Still, the Florida patient was healed within a week. (Caterpillar larvae might prove useful.)",

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 During a White House meeting on Oct. 2, a day into the shutdown, John Boehner slipped out for a smoke. Barack Obama followed him, demanding a private explanation for the shutdown. \"John, what happened?\" he asked. \"I got overrun, that's what happened,\" Boehner replied. That anecdote kicks off Politico's behind-the-scenes look at the crisis. The Wall Street Journal has one too\u2014with different bits of insider gossip. Here are the most interesting tidbits from both: Obama and Harry Reid decided on their no-negotiation strategy over the summer, believing that Boehner could never unite his fractured caucus behind anything. Republicans never believed the pair would stick to it. Boehner and Reid initially struck a deal in which Boehner would pass a sequester-level budget with an ObamaCare-defunding rider that the Senate could simply strip out. Boehner assumed\u2014incorrectly\u2014that his caucus only wanted a show vote. Boehner's former chief of staff was feeding the White House intelligence, telling it that Boehner would have to fight up until the debt ceiling deadline. Reid also took to monitoring Twitter for hints on the GOP's next move\u2014a sign of how badly communication was flowing. Many Republicans turned to Joe Biden, hoping he would intervene. Biden told them he'd been \"sidelined \u2026 at the direction of the president,\" one rep says. Reid, bitter about the fiscal cliff deal Biden negotiated, had wanted him out. At one point, Boehner brought up the idea of a \"grand bargain\" at a White House meeting; Reid laughed in his face. When Paul Ryan joined the fray at an Oct. 10 meeting, he told Obama that he would \"miss his moment\" and derail his whole term if he didn't strike a deal. But he also made what White House aides called a \"Freudian slip,\" saying, \"We\u2019re going to have six weeks to negotiate the debt limit.\" That night, aides to Boehner, Cantor, and Obama began talking about a broader budget deal, and agreed to talk more in the morning. The White House never called. When Mitch McConnell finally decided he had to broker the deal, he partnered with Lamar Alexander\u2014angering Susan Collins, who had worked far harder on the process, only to see her own deal torpedoed. McConnell picked Alexander because he had better conservative credentials, and was pals with Reid confidante Chuck Schumer. Alexander and Schumer brokered the deal behind the scenes, then passed it off to Reid and McConnell. McConnell tells the Washington Post that he saw himself as a backup quarterback thrown into the game. \"I felt like I was on the two-yard line, I had a pretty weak offensive line, and the best I could hope for was to try to punt.\" Boehner made one last-ditch attempt to pass an alternative. \"We're running out of time,\" he told his caucus. \"Your 'no' vote has consequences.\" But as Reid and Obama had predicted, he couldn't convince them. With the ball back in McConnell and Reid's court, McConnell made a few last-minute demands. Reid rejected them. It took all of 15 minutes for McConnell to call back and accept Reid's terms.",

In terms of civics and history, 56% and 55% of 12th-graders said the same thing, respectively; 21% said ditto about math And some of the intel gathered on the amount of work kids do seems to back this up: Nearly a third of 8th-graders say they read less than five pages a day ... in school or as homework. A third also say they write lengthy answers on reading tests two times a year\u2014or less.

Per CNN, Idaho State University has not been able to account for the bit of radioactive material since 2003 but, nonetheless, believes it was properly stored at a licensed disposal facility. However, with no documented proof, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Friday it must propose the fine. Dr. Cornelis Van der Schyf, vice president for research at the university, blamed partially completed paperwork from 15 years ago as the school tried to dispose of the plutonium. \"Unfortunately, because there was a lack of sufficient historical records to demonstrate the disposal pathway employed in 2003, the source in question had to be listed as missing,\" he said in a statement to the AP. The statement said the plutonium \"poses no direct health issue or risk to public safety.\" The plutonium was being used to develop ways to ensure nuclear waste containers weren't leaking and to find ways to detect radioactive material being illegally brought into the US following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. While the missing amount could not be used to make a nuclear bomb, it could be used to create a so-called dirty bomb to spread nuclear contamination. The university, which has 30 days to dispute the proposed fine, reported the plutonium missing on Oct. 13, according to documents released by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The agency said a school employee doing a routine inventory discovered the university could only account for 13 of its 14 plutonium sources, each weighing about the same small amount.",

He dug up a 2004 study that asked 45 men and 18 women to sleep on one side or the other and fill out a popular sleep questionnaire called the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (which evaluates sleep using seven factors, including \"subjective sleep quality,\" sleep duration, and use of sleep drugs). The study found that just 14.6% of right-side sleepers reported bad dreams, compared to 40.9% of their lefty counterparts. Right-side sleepers also reported more dreams with feelings of safety or relief, but had worse-quality sleep than left-siders. Berical also found a 2012 study that analyzed the sleep positions and dreams of over 670 students. The study found that face-down sleepers had more positive and vivid dreams, which were more often about \"sex,\" \"being unable to move,\" \"being tied up,\" or \"being locked up,\" Van Winkles reports. The researcher behind that study, Calvin Kai-Ching Yu, concluded that \"the brain during sleep is not at all totally detached from the external world,\" adding that \"the unconscious brains of the dreamers try to make sense, and even make use of, the external stimuli.\" Berical's conclusion? \"It can\u2019t hurt to roll your loved one over when you sense a nightmare coming on,\" he writes. \"Assuming you can avoid the flailing arms, that is.\" (It turns out that humans are incredibly good at sleeping.)",

He said the last anyone had heard from Pappas was in a Tuesday morning text message in which Pappas wrote that he was going to kill himself. Acevedo said police searched his home at 4am Wednesday and found evidence that ties Pappas to the killing, but he declined to elaborate as to the nature of the evidence. The chief said Pappas, who was a peace officer in Harris County for three decades per the Houston Chronicle, is white and very fit, and that he's likely getting around on his 10-speed bicycle, which he rides \"extensively and almost exclusively.\" Friends and family have described Hausknecht as a humble and generous man who was adored by his patients, volunteered in his community and cared about the environment.

Keshia Knight Pulliam, 38, who played little Rudy Huxtable on The Cosby Show, is expected to be in the Norristown, Pa., courthouse to watch the proceedings against her 79-year-old former boss, with Cosby spokesman Andrew Wyatt telling People that Pulliam won't be there to \"proclaim guilt or innocence,\" but simply \"to finally hear the truth for herself.\" Wyatt says Cosby's wife on the show, Phylicia Rashad, will also appear in the courtroom at some point, though the New York Daily News says it has been told that a Rashad appearance Monday is \"unlikely\" because she's working. Reports of Malcolm-Jamal Warner, who played son Theo Huxtable, attending are similarly being bandied about. The New York Times offers an overview of what to expect during the trial\u2014\"perhaps America's highest profile celebrity trial since that of OJ Simpson\"\u2014including expected lines of evidence, the Cosby legal team's anticipated strategy, and some juror information. CNN says the trial has come down to a \"he said-she said\" scenario, with one other alleged victim expected to testify against Cosby in addition to Constand. \"What Cosby is hoping for is that the jury forgets about the other 48 [alleged victims],\" a Fordham criminal law professor notes. Meanwhile, Constand herself is reportedly ready to face intense grilling on the witness stand. \"There's no trepidation, no fear,\" a close friend who's also one of Cosby's alleged victims tells NBC. \"She used to play basketball and she prepared for those games like nobody else and that is what she has done here.\" (Vice calls the trial a \"test for America.\")",

So researchers at the University of California, Davis, decided to track thousands of players in two multiplayer online role-playing games and compare just how quickly the players advanced to higher levels. And as Cuihua \u201cCindy\u201d Shen, an assistant professor of communication, reports in the Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, when controlling for factors such as time devoted to playing, character choice, and membership in a player's guild, \"The gender differences disappear.\" In fact, she goes on to write for the Conversation, \"Women advanced at least as fast as men did.\" Shen says the findings confirm certain differences in style of play, such as that men tend to focus on competing and gaining in-game status while women tend to play more socially and help others. But in terms of the bottom line: advancing to a higher level, the difference was nil among the 11,000 gamers they analyzed playing Everquest II and Chevalier's Romance III. Aside from one study in 2009, Vocativ reports that this is the first to figure out how to go about testing gender differences in gaming performance outside of a lab. Why does it matter? Nearly half the gaming population is now female, yet they are represented at even lower numbers in STEM fields of science, technology, engineering, and math. \"The stereotype that women are worse players at games could contribute to a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" Shen says.

Scott Stevens was a successful Ohio finance exec whose life started unraveling in 2006 after a trade show in Vegas. For six years, his gambling habit spiraled out of control: He sneaked off to gamble when his wife thought he was working, embezzled nearly $4 million from his firm, and drained his family's savings\u2014until the day in 2012 he decided to end his life. After his suicide, Stacy started researching gambling addiction (she hadn't even known about her husband's problem) and filed suit against the West Virginia casino where he was a regular, as well as the maker of the slot machines there. Experts relay how casinos track and target addicted gamblers, supply ready flows of cash via on-site ATMs, and offer plenty of perks to keep them coming back. But it's the modern-day slot machines themselves, with deceptive technology called virtual reel mapping, that seem to be designed to lull gamblers into a trance\u2014or what the industry refers to as \"continuous gaming productivity\"\u2014so they don't stop playing. While the casinos and machine manufacturers place the blame for gambling addictions on individuals, Terry Noffsinger, the lead attorney for the Stevens suit, says these addictive machines are not due to \"negligence. It's intentional.\" Stacy Stevens lost her case in West Virginia, but Noffsinger believes the movement to hold casinos accountable for addicts will gain momentum, much like how the tobacco industry eventually paid for sickening its own customers. \"The public is learning more about it,\" he says.

Among their warnings: The Wall Street Journal reports that the decision could have a huge impact on sites like Netflix and YouTube, whose video services hog a lot of bandwidth (they account for 32% and 19% of peak web traffic, respectively). If ISPs start making Netflix, for instance, pay a usage fee to maintain speedy content delivery, that cost could make a serious dent in its profits\u2014or trickle down to consumers.

According to RT, the police and national guard were called in to break up the battle at Khovanskoye cemetery in Moscow. The BBC describes the conflict as a \"territorial dispute between two different groups of cemetery workers.\" Combatants were possibly fighting a \"turf war\" over who gets to provide burial services at the highly profitable 500-acre cemetery, Moscow's largest. But USA Today reports workers may have been fighting a gang that tried to force them to pay up to 90% of their wages as a \"tax.\" Russian police say the two people killed during Saturday's fracas were run over by a car fleeing the scene. Three people in the car, all reportedly armed with guns, were arrested. In total more than 50 people were arrested in connection with the brawl. Ten people were reported wounded. Some combatants were said to be armed with guns and gunfire was reported, but it appears no one was shot.

And the ruckus isn't over yet, as the actor is now going after Netflix for a documentary on Guzman, set to start airing Friday, that Penn's spokesman says in an email to the New York Times is a \"profoundly false, foolish, and reckless narrative\" that could put Penn's life in danger. The actor's main bone of contention with The Day I Met El Chapo: The Kate del Castillo Story: that he thinks the three-episode film hints he assisted the DOJ in helping to capture El Chapo, who was busted right around the time Penn's Rolling Stone article went public. Del Castillo, a Mexican actress, was with Penn when he met with Guzman, and the film is said to take place from her POV. Producer David Broome denies there's anything in the film that says Penn \"is in cahoots\" with the Justice Department and that both he and Netflix tried to see if Penn wanted to take part (Penn reportedly never answered); Netflix backs that up, saying in a statement \"Penn was given the opportunity on multiple occasions to participate.\" Broome says when Penn saw an advance copy of the film, he demanded changes. Deadline notes that Penn's lawyers contacted Netflix shortly after and said Penn was afraid Guzman's associates might go after him if the film wasn't altered. A letter from Penn's lawyer to Netflix notes that \"blood will be on [Netflix's] hands if this film causes bodily harm\" to Penn. (In the end, Penn thought his Rolling Stone article on El Chapo was a failure.)",

It is quiet no longer as the Centers for Disease Control confirms what appear to be about 90 cases across 33 states so far this year, and three of them are in Oregon, home to the first case in 2014, reports the Oregonian. Washington, which saw only a couple cases in 2014, appears to be suffering from something of an outbreak, with nine cases so far this year including the first suspected fatality; a 6-year-old boy is believed to have died from the illness, reports MyNorthwest.com. The illness is not contagious, according to doctors, but it's not clear how people contract it. Little is known about AFM, though it's been linked to enteroviruses as well as West Nile and related viruses, and there is no treatment other than comfort care. It affects the nervous system, particularly the spinal cord, and telltale symptoms include weakness and paralysis. \"If a child or adult is experiencing any kind of weakness at all, they should see their health care provider immediately,\" Oregon's public health division spokesperson tells KATU.

No president has lost as many in back-to-back midterms since Harry Truman lost 83 in 1946 and 1950, writes Stuart Rothenberg. Dwight Eisenhower managed to lose a total of 66, but Obama seems on track to top him. More typical is the pattern of Bill Clinton, who lost 54 in 1994 but bounced back with a gain of five in 1998. Still, if Tuesday is shaping up to be a night of celebration for the GOP, Politico offers a reality check, at least in the Senate: Several first-term Republicans in vulnerable states will be up for re-election in 2016.

Trump shook up the defense industry once again on Thursday when he tweeted about negotiations for fighter jets, pitting Boeing and Lockheed Martin against each other, reports Reuters. \"Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!\" tweeted Trump, who has been holding meetings with aerospace execs at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Lockheed shares, which went down 4% after an earlier Trump tweet, dived 2% in after-hours trading, while Boeing was up 0.7%. A roundup of coverage: Politico takes a close look at the implications of Trump involving himself so closely in the federal procurement process and turning it into a \"$440 billion weapon.\" Presidents including Obama have used the process to advance their agendas, but experts say it's unprecedented for one to target individual companies and contracts the way Trump is doing\u2014and his approach is likely to create great uncertainty for defense companies. Business Insider looks at the F-35's capabilities\u2014and the $379 billion contract for Lockheed to supply 2,443 of them to the military. Pentagon officials involved with the F-35 says the fifth-generation jet is far ahead of the Boeing plane, meaning it would take years of redesigning and testing for the Super Hornet to have the same capabilities. The AP reports that Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher said: \"We have committed to working with the president-elect and his administration to provide the best capability, deliverability, and affordability,\" while Lockheed declined to comment. Bloomberg reports that Trump's action \"sidelined decades of policy and practice in how the government spends billions of dollars annually on military hardware.\" A Teal Group military aircraft analyst tells Bloomberg that Trump's tweet was \"bizarre,\" especially since only the Navy uses the Super Hornet, while the Marines are \"completely dependent\" on F-35Bs and the Air Force is sticking with the F-35A. \"Thus, Trump's tweet is both late to the game and completely irrelevant.\" Retired Rear Adm. Dave Oliver tells Politico that Trump's attempt to bring the tactics of the New York real estate market to military procurement will probably just drive prices up. \"He will scare the bejesus out of some fifth-level auditor who is going to say, 'Goodness gracious, maybe I ought to look at whoever he is attacking at the moment,' says Oliver, who was a top Pentagon acquisition official in the 1990s. \"Whether the president has any legal standing of any kind in this doesn't matter.

Some major sticking points: The Better Care Reconciliation Act will ask poor and middle-class Americans to pay more for less coverage, and Medicaid would be cut after expansions are rolled back. Medicaid patients would be unable to get treatment at Planned Parenthood, which would be defunded for a year. The bill also includes a tax break for the wealthy. Here's what else you need to know: First, Politico has the full text of the 142-page document Republicans are calling a \"discussion draft.\" Three Republican senators can defeat the bill by joining Democrats to vote against it. FiveThirtyEight reports the most likely candidates are Rand Paul and Mike Lee (who don't believe it goes far enough; Paul recently said he doesn't want \"ObamaCare lite\") and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski (who want more protections for Medicaid and pre-existing conditions). ABC News reports four Republican senators have already said they won't vote for the bill without more information and negotiation: Paul, Lee, Ron Johnson, and Ted Cruz. They released a joint statement saying the bill doesn't do enough to repeal ObamaCare. The bill's writing was cloaked in such secrecy that the Week reports as of Thursday morning quite a few Republican senators still had not seen it; Murkowski, for example, told a reporter, \"I am not a reporter, and I am not a lobbyist, so I've seen nothing.\" President Trump had called the House bill \"mean\" and in need of \"more heart.\" So Scientific American takes a look to see if the Senate version fulfills that requirement. When asked by a reporter if the Senate bill had enough heart, Trump called it \"very good\" but in need of \"a little negotiation,\" CNN reports.

Nancy Carlson, the Illinois woman who bought it for $995, sent it to NASA to confirm it was the real deal. It was\u2014and surprised NASA officials kept it instead of returning it, touching off a legal fight. It turns out the bag was given the same inventory identification number as a similar one used on the final Apollo 17 mission in 1972, the Christian Science Monitor reports. (Ary had sold that one in 2001 for $24,150. It was eventually recovered.) Carlson sued in June to have the bag returned to her, but federal prosecutors are asking a judge to rescind the sale. Astronauts called the lunar bags the \u201cpurse.\u201d After Armstrong\u2019s death in 2012, his widow found one of them, filled with space-related objects, in a closet.",

Before the result was announced Sunday, US Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan said the US would not recognize the election winner, reports Reuters. He said the US is considering oil sanctions on Venezuela, though Washington wants to target \"corrupt regime officials,\" not \"damage the country in a way that makes it difficult to repair after democracy is restored.\" Maduro told supporters outside the presidential palace in Caracas that his \"truly popular victory\" had been achieved through an \"impeccable electoral process,\" but Falcon and other critics said irregularities including widespread vote-buying made the results invalid and called for new elections, the Guardian reports. Reuters notes that after voting, residents of the crisis-stricken country were asked to scan their government-issued \"fatherland cards\"\u2014which are required to claim benefits\u2014at pro-Maduro tents near polling stations to qualify for a \"prize\" from the socialist leader.

Police believe 56-year-old Dwight Lamon Jones, who shot himself at a Scottsdale motel early Monday, killed all six people in around 96 hours starting early Thursday, the New York Times reports. Police say Jones started the spree when he killed prominent psychiatrist Steven Pitt, whom he'd been required to see as part of divorce proceedings. On Friday, he allegedly killed Veleria Sharp and Laura Anderson, two paralegals at the firm his wife used during the divorce. Hours later Jones allegedly killed Marshall Levine, a marriage counselor who used the same office as a counselor Jones' son saw during the divorce. Police believe Jones also killed Mary Simmons, 70, and Bryon Thomas, 72, in Fountain Hills, around 15 miles away from the other shootings, but their connection to him is still unclear. Jones left around 10 hours of YouTube video in which he outlines an alleged conspiracy to steal custody of his son, who's now 21 years old, the Arizona Republic reports. Ex-wife Connie Jones says Jones was a \"very emotionally disturbed person\" and she divorced him after he hit her and threatened to kill her. She was granted sole custody of their son. The AP reports that Jones says her new husband, a retired police detective, was the one who made the connection between the divorce and the shootings and told police of his suspicions.",

He should know: Brook currently is trekking the 2,650-mile PCT, which runs from the Mexican border through California, Oregon, and Washington to the border with Canada. But don't take his word for it: The Pacific Crest Trail Association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail. To put things in perspective: 300 people attempted to complete the entire PCT in 2006, according to the AP, with about 120 of those making it. In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the PCTA's Jack Haskel told the AP in 2015. But after the movie, starring Reese Witherspoon, was released in 2014, interest in the PCT exploded. \"Millions are hearing about it now and are being inspired,\" Haskel said. Strayed, more or less unprepared for the journey, hiked 1,100 miles of the trail as a form of therapy as she grappled with personal demons. \"However for others that follow her strategy of deliberate ineptitude, things might not turn out so well,\" writes DontHikeLikeWild.org. \"Our advice to would-be hikers: Grow a spine first. Then get out there and hike the PCT.\" (This female hiker is the \"biggest badass you've never heard of.\")",

The members of the campus group Feminists United say they've received so many abusive threats online that they feel unsafe on their own campus, and they accuse the school of doing too little to protect them. Last month, one of their members was killed, allegedly by a male roommate, though authorities have made no links between the Yik Yak threats and the death of Grace Rebecca Mann. Yik Yak is popular on college campuses because it allows users within a relatively small area to post and receive anonymous messages on their phones. Members of the feminists' group say they've endured cyber-stalking and repeated threats of rape and murder, in particular after two incidents: They spoke out against allowing frats on campus because of concerns over sexual abuse, and they got the rugby team suspended over an abusive chant. (Mann's accused killer is a former rugby player.) Afterward, the Yik Yak threats came pouring in. \u201cIt created an increasing level of fear and anxiety,\u201d says attorney Lisa Banks. \u201cThey had no way to know if people who were posting messages were sitting next to them in class or walking next to them on campus.\u201d The school says it has investigated all threats of violence, and Yik Yak says it is working to curb hate speech on its service, reports the Washington Post",

William Hannah passed away in September 2017 at Salford Royal Hospital while being treated after a car accident that had left him with several broken bones and serious head injuries, the BBC reports. Hannah also developed a lung infection, and it was while trying to ease his breathing that hospital staff made the mistake that has spurred the Hannah family's complaint. Per a release from their lawyers, a doctor went to flush out one of Hannah's lungs with saline solution, but an assistant accidentally passed him a bottle of cleaning detergent instead, which the doctor then \"unknowingly\" used to rinse Hannah's lung, People reports. The doctor realized the mistake afterward and tried to get as much of the detergent out of Hannah's lung as he could, but Hannah's lawyers say the grandfather's condition deteriorated and he died the next day. In a statement to People, the hospital's medical director acknowledges that Hannah \"did not receive the high standard of care we always pride ourselves on.\" The BBC cites an internal hospital report that found what happened to Hannah was due to various factors, including poor communication and staff training, a container without a label, an equipment cart that wasn't adequately stocked, and \"distraction by other life critical tasks.\" An inquiry into the exact cause of Hannah's death will take place in early 2019.

The Telegraph reports that Sombra (Spanish for \"shadow\") has had to be moved from the drug-trafficking hot spot of Turbo, in Colombia's Uraba region, to the relatively safer El Dorado International Airport in Bogota after what the BBC calls the country's \"most powerful criminal organization\" decided she should be killed.

The \"friendly, calm canine\" often shows up on TV and in pictures with fans, and the police boast about her on Twitter. Which is why Urabe\u00f1os members were enraged enough to offer the bounty, which police intelligence reports note could range anywhere from $7,000 to $70,000. \"The fact they want to hurt Sombra and offer such a high reward for her capture or death shows the impact she's had on their profits,\" a police rep tells the Telegraph.

Here's what people had to say about the candidates' performances: \"This was Clinton's best debate of the election,\" decides Chris Cilliza at the Washington Post. She was \"in total control all night\" and scored plenty of points against Sanders, he writes, while Sanders stumbled despite an improved command of foreign policy\u2014and will probably regret claiming that he will be better on race relations than President Obama. Clinton didn't score any home runs but she still won, according to Matthew Yglesias at Vox. Nothing happened that would cause Clinton supporters to think twice, he writes, while voters getting a first look at Sanders would not have been impressed: The candidate turned in a \"dangerously complacent debate performance\" and failed to assuage \"doubts about his electability\" or add anything new to his critique of Clinton. Scot Lehigh at the Boston Globe also calls the debate for Clinton. She came out on top by \"presenting herself as a deeply knowledgeable candidate whose progressive stands are tempered by real-world practicality,\" he writes. This was the case in her attacks on Sanders' plan for a single-payer health care system, where Clinton stressed that the \"focus should be on expanding coverage and care to those who still lack it, rather than starting from scratch and overhauling the entirety of the system.\" Both candidates \"performed well initially in talking about systemic racism and reforming the criminal justice system,\" but the \"calm, cool, and collected\" Clinton prevailed, writes Lucia Graves at the Guardian. Sanders, she writes, \"was oddly on the defensive despite what has been momentum in his favor, starting out the night more combative than Clinton and wasting his time on petty one-liners.\" Click for some of the debate's best lines.",

The struggling economy is a \"double-edged sword in many ways because (students) and their parents have fewer resources to pay for college costs, which may lead them to take on more debt,\" the institute's research director tells USA Today. \"And then they're entering a down economy where it's hard to find a good job that allows them to repay the debt.\" A recent study found that parents now cover an average 27% of college costs, down from 37% just three years ago.

Only 2012 had more, with 1,981 sightings. The provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland each saw an increase in reports over 2014, but Quebec outpaced them all, according to data from 17 sources, including Transport Canada and YouTube.

Montreal led Canadian cities with 97 reports, followed by 78 in Toronto, and 69 in Vancouver. That doesn't mean there were that many unexplained cases; about 88% of unidentifiable objects turn out to be stars, planets, airplanes, or helicopters, Rutkowski says. Ufology Research investigates the remaining cases\u2014by visiting a site and talking to witnesses\u2014to determine if a case is \"high quality.\" About 1% to 3% of cases fall into this group, Rutkowski says.

The Times calls his guilty plea, which occurred earlier this month, \"the most explicit evidence connecting the Trump campaign to the Russian government's meddling in last year's election.\" Similarly, Papadopoulos met with a woman he believed to be related to Vladimir Putin after joining the campaign, even though he told the FBI the contact occurred beforehand, reports Business Insider. \"He believed she had connections to Russian government officials; and he sought to use her Russian connections over a period of months in an effort to arrange a meeting between the campaign and Russian government officials,\" per the court filing.",

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Florida's Alan McCarty has made clear he does not like judges, and he will spend the next 20 years in prison as a result. The 36-year-old received the 20-year sentence this week\u2014along with an extra 10 days for contempt of court, a penalty more serious than it sounds\u2014for calling 911 last year and promising to kill a judge he mistakenly believed had ruled against him in a custody case, reports the Daytona Beach News Journal. During Wednesday's sentencing in front of a different judge, Matt Foxman, McCarty had to be removed from the courtroom as Foxman listed his offenses. \u201cWhat a bunch of (expletive) lies you stupid piece of (expletive),\u201d McCarty yelled. \u201cYou threatened my life, (expletive, expletive). (Expletive) you, you (expletive, expletive).\u201d Foxman explained that he was tacking on the 10-day contempt of court sentence for a variety of reasons, including one particular McCarty outburst during the trial. \u201cYou also offered me to perform a sex act upon you, which I politely declined and still do to this day for whatever that\u2019s worth,\u201d Foxman said. The extra 10 days will be served when the 20-year sentence is done, and it's no small thing, explains the News Journal. It means that McCarty won't be able to participate in a work-release program while in prison. McCarty also was convicted of threatening 911 dispatchers, reports GateHouse Media Florida, which notes that because of his courtroom behavior, McCarty had to observe most of his trial from behind one-way glass.",

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 We'll start by tempering expectations: The breakthrough you're about to read about has \"no direct link\" to a human treatment, reports AFP, but it's noteworthy nonetheless. Scientists say they've identified a molecule that \"reverses\" the effects of Down syndrome in mice. The molecule is called sonic hedgehog pathway agonist, and it was administered to mice who were genetically altered to have characteristics akin to those of Down syndrome. The molecule, which is not approved as safe for humans, spurs a gene to make a protein tied to development. \"Most people with Down syndrome have a cerebellum that's about 60% of the normal size,\" says one of the Johns Hopkins researchers. Science World Report notes that the mice were injected on the day they were born, at which point their cerebellums hadn't fully developed. The single injection appeared to normalize the cerebellum's growth. In an added surprise, memory and learning, \"which are generally controlled by the hippocampus, not the cerebellum,\" were also positively affected. But the researcher explains that applying the treatment to humans is a tricky proposition, and could have unintended consequences, like raising cancer risk.",

Soldiers have been called in to assist with the mandatory evacuation of the Leilani Estates neighborhood in the Puna district of Big Island, which is in danger of being inundated by lava, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The eruption sent lava flowing through the subdivision, where vapor is emerging from cracks, and witnesses say they saw fountains of lava rising around 150 feet from a crack in the volcano, reports the AP. Emergency shelters have been opened for around 1,700 people affected by the evacuation order. The eruption follows hundreds of earthquakes over the period of several days, most of them around 2.0 magnitude, CNN reports. The most severe was a 5.0 magnitude earthquake Thursday morning, according to the US Geological Survey. One local man tells KHON 2 that he flew his drone near a \"curtain of fire\" moving toward residential areas. \"It sounded like if you were to put a bunch of rocks into a dryer and turn it on as high as you could,\" he says. \"You could just smell sulfur and burning trees and underbrush and stuff.\" Scientists say there's a lot of magma in the extremely active volcano's reservoir and they're not sure how long the eruption will last.",

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Montana's attorney general is fighting to preserve his state's ability to curb corporate political spending, and almost half of America's states are backing him. Some 22 states and the District of Columbia have filed a brief urging the Supreme Court not to use its Citizens United decision to strike down Montana's law limiting corporate money in politics, reports the Guardian. Montana's century-old Corrupt Practices Act, which was introduced to curb the power of copper barons, has been upheld by the state's highest court, putting it in conflict with Citizens United. The states, led by New York, argue that laws like Montana's are needed to prevent corruption at the state level. They say the court should reconsider some of its findings in the Citizens United case, arguing that the court was wrong when it claimed that unlimited independent political spending does not \"give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption,\" AP reports. Experts say that while it is highly unlikely that the court will reconsider Citizens United, it may clarify the ruling to allow Montana's law to stand\u2014or simply issue a ruling reversing Montana's decision to uphold its law.",
