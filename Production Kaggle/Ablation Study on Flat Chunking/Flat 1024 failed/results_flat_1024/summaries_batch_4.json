    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A pharmaceutical company that has in recent years made billions of dollars on hepatitis C treatments\u2014the three the FDA has approved range from $75,000 to $94,500\u2014has been named a \"price gouger\" and \"tax dodger\" in a new report. Gilead Sciences, the sixth richest drugmaker in the world, \"is making a fortune selling essential drugs to the very government and taxpayers that helped pay to develop them, and then dodging taxes on the resulting profits,\" says Frank Clemente, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, which issued the report this month. Gilead has avoided some $10 billion in taxes by moving assets to Ireland, where there is a lower tax rate, and then not bringing some $28.5 billion in profits back into the US. Per the Washington Post, the California-based company's revenues in 2015 hit $32.6 billion, up three times from 2012. As for the accusation of gouging: Last year, a Senate investigation found that the company \"pursued [a] profit-driven strategy\" with its hepatitis drugs, rather than making the drugs more accessible at a lower price (it had considered $50,000). As the Post notes, Gilead, which declined to comment on the report, isn't alone in looking overseas for tax relief. Plenty of other pharmaceutical and technology companies do it. Apple, for instance, has squirreled away nearly $200 billion abroad, Bloomberg reported last year. According to Citizens for Tax Justice, that's enabled the company to avoid paying $59.2 billion in US taxes. Pfizer has some $193 billion abroad, per the Post. The new report singling out Gilead, the Post points out, highlights the \"simmering battle\" between President Obama and big business over the practice of sending assets to foreign countries.",

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Hillary Clinton has joined Donald Trump in selecting a white man from a swing state who describes himself as \"boring\" for a running mate\u2014and liberal Democrats, especially Bernie Sanders supporters, aren't exactly fired up about Sen. Tim Kaine. Clinton, however, describes the former Virginia governor as \"a lifelong fighter for progressive causes,\" and both Wall Street donors and labor groups are happy with the choice. Republicans, meanwhile including RNC chief Reince Priebus, were quick to highlight the party divisions. A round-up of reactions: The Progressive Change Campaign Committee is among the groups not happy about Kaine's past support for the big trade deals criticized by Donald Trump. \"The mood of the country is a populist one,\" group co-founder Stephanie Taylor said in a statement to Politico. \"Unfortunately, since Tim Kaine voted to fast track the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Republicans now have a new opening to attack Democrats on this economic populist issue.\" Union chiefs expressed their support for Kaine, including Service Employees International Union chief Mary Kay Henry, who called him \"an experienced leader with a proven track record on issues from raising wages to immigration reform and racial justice,\" the Washington Post reports. The Trump campaign wasted no time coming up with a nickname for Kaine: It is calling him \"Corrupt Kaine,\" based on gifts he received as governor, the New York Times reports. \"It's only fitting that Hillary Clinton would select an ethically challenged insider like Tim Kaine who\u2019s personally benefited from the rigged system,\" a Trump spokesman says. Wall Street lobbyists are satisfied with the choice, especially since the other candidates being vetted included Elizabeth Warren. \"He's a sign of Hillary being Hippocratic in her pick\u2014he does no harm,\" a top lobbyist tells Politico. \"Time will tell if progressives show real angst or if it\u2019s just fringe groups.\" The National Organization of Women supports Kaine: \"The combination of Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine stands in sharp contrast to the turn-back-the-clock, step up the war on women platform of Donald Trump and Mike Pence,\" NOW President Terry O'Neill said in a statement. \"Women know this is the most important election in a generation, and we also know that we have a steadfast advocate in Tim Kaine.\" Norman Solomon, who says his \"Bernie Delegates Network\" represents hundreds of Sanders delegates, calls Kaine \"a loyal servant of oligarchy.\" \"If Clinton has reached out to Bernie supporters, it appears that she has done so to stick triangulating thumbs in their eyes,\" he tells the Washington Post. The AP spoke to convention delegates and found that Clinton supporters consider Kaine a \"solid\" choice who will appeal to a range of voters, while Sanders supporters are deeply unhappy with the choice. It \"was a horrible pick,\" says Angie Morelli, a Sanders delegate from Nevada. \"In a time when she is trying to cater to Sanders supporters, it was more catering to conservative voters and she's not going to get any wave from it.\" USA Today lists some facts about Kaine, who is fluent in Spanish and is one of just 20 people to have been a mayor, a governor and a US senator.",

After reports filtered out about some NFL players kneeling, raising their fists, and taking part in other forms of protest during preseason games on Thursday evening, Trump once more railed against those who did so. \"The NFL players are at it again - taking a knee when they should be standing proudly for the National Anthem,\" Trump tweeted. \"Numerous players, from different teams, wanted to show their 'outrage' at something that most of them are unable to define. They make a fortune doing what they love......\" He continued in a second tweet: \"Be happy, be cool! A football game, that fans are paying soooo much money to watch and enjoy, is no place to protest. Most of that money goes to the players anyway.\" And a final warning: \"Find another way to protest. Stand proudly for your National Anthem or be Suspended Without Pay!\" Politico and the Washington Post take issue with Trump's assertion that the players haven't been able to define what they're protesting, with Politico noting the players are pushing back against \"racial injustice and police brutality.\" The Post goes even deeper, compiling very specific statements from the players themselves. In May, the NFL banned players from sitting or kneeling during the anthem, but that policy was put on hold in July and won't be enforced as the league and players union try to hash things out on the sidelines.",

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 If the words \"pole vaulting\" don't inspire fear in you, they should. That's the upshot of a Vice article about the sport, which succinctly expresses why: \"At 20 feet, a pole vault accident is like someone falling off the roof of their house, while running as fast at they can with a thick pole in their hands.\" If that sounds like a brush with death, it quite literally can be: A 2001 study analyzed the 32 catastrophic pole-vault injuries that were reported to the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research between 1982 and 1998; half the accidents resulted in death, and 6 in permanent disabilities. A follow-up study published in 2012 noted that one safety-related change made in 2003 was an expansion of the landing pad's minimum dimensions. In the 8 years that followed, the study noted only two of the 19 catastrophic injuries were fatal. But the rest weren't pretty: major head injuries and spine or pelvic fractures were among them. And a study of collegiate pole vaulters published this last January found 41% sustained some kind of injury, a figure that researchers saw as suggestive of the fact that \"injuries are very common in experienced vaulters.\" The injury stats aren't good, and the potential pay and fame aren't much better. So why the heck do it? Vice talked to US record-holder Brad Walker (one of 18 men to ever clear 6 meters), who sums up vaulters as \"risk-takers, usually with something to prove to themselves ... you won't find a vaulter jumping high who doesn't have at least one screw loose.\" As for why they stay with it, Vice points to its highly technical and challenging nature: As you approach the box you're a sprinter; then you're a gymnast. Walker says you need \"significant body control and spatial awareness,\" too.",

Several hundred Pacific walruses began amassing on an island off Alaska\u2019s northwest coast in the first week of August in what wildlife officials say is the earliest date yet for their annual \"haulout.\" The culprit appears to be shrinking Arctic ice. Walruses tend to head ashore two weeks after warm temperatures cause sea ice to recede too far north for them in the Chukchi Sea. This year, it happened earlier than ever. Walruses typically use sea ice for protection and as a home base, particularly for juveniles, while adults dive to the ocean floor for food. But \"when that ice retreats to the deeper water, they can't do that,\" Fish and Wildlife rep Andrea Medeiros tells Alaska Public Media. For the past several years, a barrier island near Point Lay has served as an alternative home base. Last year, thousands of walruses had arrived there by Oct. 7. This year, however, the haulout was observed beginning on Aug. 3\u2014a full two weeks ahead of the next earliest date observed back in 2011, reports Alaska Dispatch News. Medeiros tells the AP that last week some 2,000 walruses were observed on the island, where they're expected to stay until the fall. Hoping to head north to observe the animals? Officials would rather you not. Not only is it illegal to disturb them, the walruses are known to stampede to the water in response to plane and boat activity in the area, which spells bad news for juvenile walruses.",

The images of the \"seer stone\" that Mormons believe founder Joseph Smith used to translate buried gold plates he said he found in upstate New York 185 years ago were released as part of what the church says is an effort to be more transparent about its past, the AP reports. The photos have been published in a book that also includes pictures of the \"printer's manuscript\" of the Book of Mormon\u2014a handwritten copy of the original manuscript that was produced by one of Smith's scribes. The book, which Smith said he translated from \"reformed Egyptian\" with the stone, recounts a visit from Jesus Christ to North America, reports the Salt Lake Tribune. As for the translation, the church has this to say: \"Joseph placed ... the seer stone in a hat, pressed his face into the hat to block out extraneous light, and read aloud the English words that appeared on the instrument.\" It says the translation occurred over three months in 1829 as part of a \"a series of miraculous events.\" Indeed: In March, the Deseret News reported that the church says it takes roughly five years to translate and then produce the Book of Mormon in another language. The church says it is trying to make its history more \"tangible\" with the release, but Terryl Givens, professor of literature and religion at the University of Richmond, tells the AP that the church is also trying to show skeptics it has nothing to hide. \"Other churches' origins are concealed by the mist of history. Mormonism is the first world religion in which the origins were exposed to public view, to documentation, to journalists, and newspaper reporting.\" (Last year, the church admitted that Smith had up to 40 wives.)",

Maine is one of 19 states where Republicans have blocked Medicaid expansion available under the ACA. The Maine legislature has voted repeatedly to expand Medicaid only to have Gov. Paul LePage veto expansion five times. However, if expansion is approved by voters through a referendum next month, LePage would be unable to veto it. If the referendum passes, approximately 80,000 more Maine residents making up to 138% of the poverty level will be eligible for Medicaid. In addition to decreasing the number of uninsured Maine residents, supporters of the referendum say it will add jobs and help rural hospitals stay open. LePage, while attacking Maine hospitals for their support of the referendum on Friday, said it would take \"resources away from our most vulnerable Mainers\" to \"give free taxpayer-funded healthcare to adults who should be working and contributing,\" the Press Herald reports. Under the ACA, at least 90% of Medicaid expansion costs would be covered by the federal government.

China's legislature ruled that candidates must be backed by a nominating committee, a move that means voters are likely to have just two or three candidates to choose from\u2014all of them nominated by a pro-Beijing committee. At a protest last night, one of the pro-democracy movement's leaders called it the \"darkest day in the history of Hong Kong's democratic development\" and warned that the former British colony's people \"are no longer willing to be docile subjects,\" reports Reuters. Activists in the \"Occupy Central\" movement plan to paralyze Hong Kong's central business district to protest Beijing's decision. Analysts say Beijing feared that granting Hong Kong's demand for greater democracy would have led to similar demands on the mainland. \"In the territory controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, only Hong Kong has some space for free speech, some judicial independence, so it is a mirror for people on the mainland,\" a dissident in Beijing who was placed under house arrest ahead of the government announcement tells the New York Times. \"The outcome of this battle for democracy will also determine future battles for democracy for all of China.\" In nearby Macau, meanwhile, chief executive Fernando Chui was \"re-elected\" to another five-year term yesterday by a 400-strong pro-Beijing committee that didn't have any other candidates to choose from, the South China Morning Post reports. Five people were arrested last week over an informal poll on more democracy in the former Portuguese colony.",

Researchers from the Arctic University of Norway say they've spotted large craters apparently created by methane buildups off Norway's coast, Atlas Obscura reports. \"Multiple giant craters exist on the sea floor in an area in the west-central Barents Sea ... and are probably a cause of enormous blowouts of gas,\" they tell the Sunday Times. \"The crater area is likely to represent one of the largest hotspots for shallow marine methane release in the Arctic.\" Other experts have said gas blowouts from such craters, which measure 150 feet deep and up to a half-mile wide in Norway, could explain the sinking of ships in a region between Puerto Rico, Miami, and Bermuda dubbed the Bermuda Triangle. \"There is a version that the Bermuda Triangle is a consequence of gas hydrates reactions,\" Russian scientist Igor Yeltsov said last year, per the New Zealand Herald. Ice-like underwater methane can break away and form gas that bubbles to the surface, Live Science explained in 2014; Yeltsov says it erupts \"like a nuclear reaction, producing huge amounts of gas.\" Research has shown that such eruptions could sink sea vessels, as NBC News reported in 2003, and this YouTube video appears to confirm that. But it's not clear these blowouts even occur in the Bermuda Triangle, the Guardian notes. And skeptics say the Gulf Stream's many tropical storms would better account for the Triangle's lost ships and planes. The very term \"Bermuda Triangle\" is questionable: Still dismissed by the US Navy, it was invented in a dramatic 1964 article that probed the \"mysterious menace\" behind ships and airplanes lost in the area.

The problem? Customs agents looked at his passport and saw he traveled to Iran in 2014. He says officials told him he was being held because of a law then-President Obama signed in 2015 that requires citizens of certain countries (including Norway) to have a visa to enter the US if they've visited specific countries (like Iran) since 2011. But there are exceptions (ABC 7 explains in greater depth), and Bondevik says he's never before experienced any trouble coming into the US with that passport stamp. Further, his office checked with the US embassy in Oslo before this trip to ensure he would have no issues. Bondevik tells ABC 7 he possesses a diplomatic passport, which clearly states that he is the former PM of Norway. \"Of course I fully understand the fear of letting terrorists come into this country,\" he says, but \"it should be enough when they found ... [I'm a] former prime minister.\" He says he was made to wait for 40 minutes, then questioned for 20 minutes about the Iran trip, which he took so he could speak at a human rights conference. Though Bondevik wasn't quoted mentioning President Trump by name, he had this to say: \"I fear the future,\" he tells the Local. \"This gives great cause for concern, in line with the authoritarian leaders we see controlling other major countries.\"",

That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book\u2014Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\u2014has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.\u201d",

The long-awaited guidelines say that the procedure can greatly reduce the risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases for heterosexual men, reports Reuters, which notes that circumcision rates have dropped 10% to 58% over the last three decades. Circumcision is a personal decision, and the guidelines will stop short of recommending all newborn boys undergo the procedure, but \"the scientific evidence is clear that the benefits outweigh the risks,\" a CDC spokesman tells the AP. The CDC says that circumcision can reduce the risk of a man getting HIV or herpes from a female partner by around 50%. It also makes sex safer for female partners, although it doesn't appear to reduce the risk of contracting STDs during anal sex with other men. The draft guidelines\u2014which will face stiff opposition from anti-circumcision groups\u2014say the risk of complications from circumcision is only 0.5% for newborns, reports the Los Angeles Times. That rises to 9% among children, then drops to 5% among adults, though the guidelines\u2014which say circumcised men \"generally report minimal or no change in sexual satisfaction or function\"\u2014note that waiting for a boy to reach adolescence or adulthood lets him choose for himself.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Scott Walker is out of the GOP race after a campaign that peaked well before it officially began: He led the polls in Iowa for much of the year, but he has dropped out of the race after just 71 days, which ABC News reports is one of the shortest modern presidential campaigns on record. Where did it all go wrong for the Wisconsin governor? Insiders tell Politico that Walker was overconfident, and though he tried to act as his own campaign manager, he seemed to be \"making it up as he went along,\" causing plenty of strategic blunders. Fundraising dried up as Donald Trump's rise pushed him to the sidelines, leaving him with a large organization but little support. His sudden departure from the race came after he failed to make an impression at the second debate and a CNN poll found his support at well below 1%. \"He was a terrible candidate, but he also got Trump-ed,\" a source tells Politico. More: Sources tell CNN that although a super PAC supporting him had plenty of cash, Walker's campaign funds started to dry up after the first debate as donors looked elsewhere. Walker \"is a pragmatist above all else and just didn't see the path to a comeback\" after his poll numbers collapsed even in Iowa, a campaign insider says. Walker was hurt by flip-flops on issues like birthright citizenship, where he changed his position three times in a week, CNN notes, and by gaffes like suggesting he would consider building a wall along the Canadian border. In his exit speech last night, Walker said he had been \"called to lead by helping to clear the field in this race so that a positive conservative message can rise to the top of the field.\" He urged other candidates to follow his lead so a clear alternative to Trump could emerge, the Washington Post reports. Some of Walker's former rivals praised him as he left the race, including Marco Rubio, who called him \"one of the best governors in the country,\" and Donald Trump, who said \"he's a very nice person and has a great future,\" reports the Hill. The rival campaigns didn't wait until Walker announced his exit to start trying to poach his aides and his donors, the AP reports. The competition heated up after the announcement: A source close to the billionaire Ricketts family, which had supported Walker, tells the AP that within minutes of the governor's press conference, the family received calls from six campaigns, some of them from the candidates themselves. (Rick Perry has also dropped out of the race, and one donor wants his $5 million back.)",

Police only started looking into the possibility of connected murders after pressure from one of the victim's families. Police have now admitted they maybe could have caught Port sooner, and 17 officers are being investigated. Port left the first body outside his apartment building and called police. Despite changing his story and admitting the victim was in his apartment and he dragged the body outside, police didn't view him as a suspect, CNN reports. Port left a fake suicide note on one of the bodies that read \"BTW, please do not blame the guy I was with last night.\" Police didn't bother trying to find the \"guy.\" And there was more. The family of one of Port's victims is suing the police, accusing them of not looking into the deaths too hard because the victims were all gay.

Seven months ago, the World Anti-Doping Agency published a scathing report accusing Russia of a doping scheme involving the government, law enforcement, athletes and coaches, and even doctors, a lab, and Russia's anti-doping agency. Since then, the nation's track and field athletes have been suspended from international competition; Russian authorities did not fight that suspension, though Russia has denied the allegations. The IAAF, track and field's global governing body, made the decision about the Rio Games Friday. USA Today says it will almost certainly be challenged, naming one pole vaulter who has threatened to file a discrimination case. Russian officials had volunteered to send only athletes who had never been disciplined for drug use. But, per a source familiar with the IAAF's decision, officials say Russia hasn't done enough to convince the world its athletes are clean. The International Olympic Committee will discuss the IAAF's decision next week, but the Times says it would be unusual for the IOC to amend the ruling. Whistleblowers have alleged that Russia's doping scheme has allowed athletes to appear clean even when they're not. Before the IAAF's vote Friday, Russia's sports minister released an open letter insisting that the country was fighting doping and noting that UK authorities recently conducted independent testing of Russian athletes. But WADA had earlier alleged that many Russian athletes evaded that testing and that Russian officials threatened the testing authorities.",

Or at least that's the hope after scientists successfully used lab-created heart muscle cells to partially repair damaged hearts in monkeys, Live Science reports. The healthy stem cells were easily absorbed into the damaged hearts and allowed the organ to pump blood more easily. The procedure could lead to a new way to treat heart attacks and at least partially repair heart damage, the Guardian reports. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men and women in the US. Scientists are intrigued by the idea of treating damaged hearts by using a patient's own skin cells to create healthy heart cells, which are less likely to be rejected since they don't come from a donor. In the latest study in the journal Nature, the team at Shinshu University induced heart attacks in five macaques and then injected them with heart cells made from the skin of a healthy macaque who was a close genetic match. To avoid rejection, they ensured the donor monkey had a type of protein similar to the recipients' and they gave the sick monkeys anti-rejection drugs. After studying the macaques for three months, researchers found their immune systems tolerated the new cells, which replaced about 16% of the damaged heart tissue. In the end, the monkeys' heart muscles contracted better, pumping blood more efficiently. Human trials are not coming anytime soon, though, after the macaques developed irregular heartbeats. Still, doctors said the findings raise the possibility of treating damage caused by heart attacks. \"Currently, the only long term option for these patients is heart transplantation, but there are not enough donors to meet the current demand,\" heart researcher Sam Boateng told the Guardian.

Any similar research on humans is still years away because the results must first be replicated on animals bigger than rats, reports the BBC. Previous attempts to regenerate nerves on damaged spinal cords were stymied by scar tissue at the site of the original injury.

Eyebrows were raised about the veracity of Zhang Wei's purchase after photos were posted online of Zhang posing with the bottle and the manager of the Waldhaus Am See hotel; the Swiss hotel's Devil's Place whisky bar has a 2,500-bottle collection. The prime condition of the vintage bottle, and the wording on the label didn't add up, said doubters. They were right. The BBC reports a series of lab tests were performed and returned all-around negative results. University of Oxford researchers carbon dated the sample and say there's a 95% probability it was produced between 1970 and 1972. And it's not even a single malt, as testing by alcohol analysts Tatlock and Thomson found it was a blend of 60% malt and 40% grain.

One Twitter user joked that \"I cooked my whole turkey, ate, and did the dishes\" during the performance, while another said it was a wonder Franklin didn't get a delay of game penalty. At one point in the game, CBS even included Franklin in a graphic showing time of possession on the field. But fans at the stadium were thrilled, applauding several times throughout the performance, per People. The Lions went on to win the game 16-13.",

Per KENS5, Robert Griffin and his wife were on their way to the hospital in San Antonio when they stopped at a Chick-fil-A to drop their kids off with a friend in the parking lot. Falon Griffin was already in labor, but she told her husband she desperately needed to use the restroom. In order to do so, they had to bang on the Chick-fil-A door, because it was already closed for the night. Employees let them in and, before long, they alerted her husband that something seemed wrong. \"The manager said 'she\u2019s in the restroom and she\u2019s screaming,'\" Griffin wrote in a Facebook post about the whirlwind delivery. \"So there we were.....my wife and I in a tiny stall in the bathroom.\" As the baby's head crowned and the delivery showed no signs of slowing down, Griffin described how he had to calmly ask his wife to stop pushing for a moment when he realized the umbilical cord was wrapped around the infant's neck. \"I was somehow able to unwrap the (cord) from the baby\u2019s neck. With two more strong pushes, and using my shirt for a towel, out came Gracelyn Mae Violet Griffin,\" Griffin wrote. As the Star-Telegram notes, Griffin suggested there was also someone else in that bathroom, at least in spirit. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty ironic that a proud conservative, Christian family would have a baby in a Chick-fil-A, and wrapped in a Trump 2020 T-shirt!

It was a career-best performance in an international competition for the pair. Kim says they were motivated by their coaches and the people cheering for them. Ryom agreed: \"There were many people of different nationalities and backgrounds cheering for us. The fact that we gave them some kind of joy, that was the best part in the performance.\" While Kim and Ryom's sixth place finish in Germany was enough to nab them one of the final spots in February's Olympics, it remains unclear if they'll actually compete, Reuters reports. The decision rests with the North Korea Olympic Committee. Both South Korea and the International Olympic Committee have been pushing for North Korean athletes to participate in the Games, hoping it will be a diplomatic balm for the countries. The IOC has been providing travel, equipment, and accommodation to North Korean athletes attempting to qualify (North Korean skiers and speed skaters still have a shot), and South Korea's president said North Korea will have as much time as possible to decide if it will participate. North Korea boycotted the 1988 Summer Olympics in South Korea, but it did send a women's hockey team and taekwondo team to competitions in South Korea this year.",

He said investigators believe the suspect acted alone, though he didn't release the boy's name or the names of the victims, who were taken to hospitals in Indianapolis.

But as the Guardian reports, her ensuing off-screen plight has been largely ignored, even though she faces more than a half-century in prison. That's because Greene, whose legal name is Charlene Egbe, isn't just a cannabis advocate but the owner of the Alaska Cannabis Club, which she created on April 20, 2014, a full six months before Alaska voted to legalize the adult use of cannabis. In other words, she was receiving \"donations\" for marijuana through club \"memberships\" before it was legal to do so. Police raided the club twice and detectives made several undercover purchases, and though Greene wasn't directly involved in them, state prosecutors are charging her because the club is registered under her name. She's pleaded not guilty to charges of \"misconduct involving a controlled substance,\" and the original indictment listed eight offenses that amounted to a possible 24 years in jail. The Guardian broke the news to Greene that six offenses have since been added, raising the total to 54 years. In the Weed Blog, Greene calls this a \"modern-day lynching,\" and tells High Times that she hopes the cannabis community rallies behind her. \"I need help more than ever,\" she says. \"Now that I could lose the rest of my life because of cannabis, it feels like the people I fought for have abandoned me.\" (Alaskans can't smoke weed in public.)",

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Microsoft is releasing a patch today to fix a vulnerability in its Windows OS\u2014but not before a cyberespionage campaign against Ukrainian government employees and an American expert on Russia took place. According to the iSight cyberintelligence firm, which discovered the bug last month, hackers sent malicious PowerPoints to users on Windows Vista, 7, or 8, then activated the bug to control users' computers, the Wall Street Journal reports. The hack was part of a larger operation that also spied on NATO, the EU, and energy and telecommunications companies, Reuters reports. iSight doesn't know for sure who's behind the hacking, but it notes that a) one of the hackers is fluent in Russian; b) the Herculean effort suggests a well-supported team (i.e., helped out by a country's government); and c) the targets the hackers went after suggest Russian interests. What worries security experts is that even though there's now a patch to protect against the breach, the hacking world will try to gain access to users' computers before they have a chance to install the fix. \"Every criminal and their brother is going to be trying to exploit this flaw in the next few weeks,\" an ACLU technologist tells the Journal. Perhaps even more mysterious than who's behind the hacking is the information embedded in the software code: iSight says it\u2019s calling the spy operation \"Sandworm Team,\" Reuters notes, because of multiple references found within the hackers' code to Dune\u2014the sandworm was the toothy, desert-dwelling creature featured in the sci-fi movie, book, and TV series.

A previous investigation by the two news outlets suggested that former District Attorney Mary Lacy erred when she exonerated members of the Ramsey family in 2008 based on her interpretation of earlier DNA tests. Lacy concluded that those tests revealed that an intruder killed the girl, but outside forensic experts have since disputed that, asserting that the DNA was a mishmash of multiple people and not that of the single person referred to as \"Unknown Male 1.\" \"If you're looking for someone that doesn't exist, because actually it's several people, it's a problem,\" explained a former US attorney for Colorado. The new, more sophisticated tests could provide an answer to which view is right. They could also reveal the DNA is worthless in terms of tracking down the killer, and merely the result of \"inconsequential contact with other people,\" per the Camera. One of the most high-profile anniversary stories about the case came via CBS, whose expert panel concluded that JonBenet's brother, Burke, killed his sister. Burke has since sued, but the forensic pathologist he's going after argued in court documents this month that his view on the case was mere \"speculation\" about \"one of the major unsolved crimes\" of the 20th century and thus should be protected speech, reports People. No word on when the new DNA tests will be conducted. (Burke also talked to Dr. Phil.)",

They posted a Facebook ad for a modestly paid job managing the sanctuary\u2014and 40,000 people responded.

Months later, as the Washington Post reports, the sanctuary's caretaker has been chosen. Jeffyne Telson's husband sent her the ad soon after it was posted in August, the 62-year-old recalls. Telson runs her own cat rescue in Santa Barbara, Calif., only taking in strays; she's adopted out 3,000 cats and kittens over the past 21 years and has kept those who can't be placed at her own small sanctuary. Her application stood out, and the Bowells traveled to California to visit the couple in September. Joan and Jeffyne clicked immediately, and the Bowells offered Telson the job. She'll run the Syros sanctuary for some months, while volunteers run her Santa Barbara rescue, and other finalists for the Syros job will likely then take their own turns managing God's Little People.

If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Liam Fitzsimmons, Slaughter's chief of staff, said in a statement she died early Friday at George Washington University Hospital after injuring herself in a fall in her area home. Fitzsimmons said on Wednesday that she'd sustained a concussion but no broken bones, and her office had expressed hope for her recuperation. \"The congresswoman is tough as nails and she will bring that same spirit to this recovery,\" he said at the time, per the Democrat & Chronicle. Slaughter was originally from Kentucky and had a bachelor's degree in microbiology, as well as a master's degree in public health. She was repeatedly re-elected, sometimes narrowly, and was the longest-serving member of Congress from New York. Per the Democrat & Chronicle, she'd just announced last month she was planning on a 17th term. CNN notes she was also known for her efforts in fortifying military body armor after an Iraq War report cited all of the casualties linked to inadequate equipment. Both sides of the aisle offered their condolences upon hearing of her death. \"Congresswoman Slaughter embodied the very best of the American spirit and ideals,\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said, while the head of the House Rules Committee, the GOP's Pete Sessions, called Slaughter \"a fearless leader, deeply committed to her constituents, and a dear friend.\"",

The bank says the issues stem from a few bad eggs, who have been disciplined or fired. But \"on the rare occasions when Wells Fargo did take action against its employees for unethical sales conduct, Wells Fargo further victimized its customers by failing to inform them of the breaches, refund fees they were owed, or otherwise remedy the injuries that Wells Fargo and its bankers have caused,\" the suit alleges, per the Los Angeles Times. The suit also claims bank employees robbed customer accounts of money that was used to pay fees on accounts they never wanted, while the bank placed customers in collections and added \"derogatory information\" to credit reports, Courthouse News reports. The lawsuit follows a 2013 Times investigation which described Wells Fargo employees forging customers' signatures to open unwanted accounts. In new interviews, a former employee says false accounts were opened \"daily,\" while a customer describes \"a three-year battle\" with the bank after his three accounts multiplied to 10.

Becker's claimed post of attache for sports, culture, and humanitarian affairs \"does not exist\" in CAR records, meaning he's not an official diplomat, says Foreign Ministry chief of staff Cherubin Moroubama.

Her conclusion: \"This is how backward our world is, now: A video of a Hadid doing nothing makes a weird sort of sense. Of course!

When cops blocked their vehicle, police say the men began trying to dispose of the evidence, and white powder ended up all over the inside of their car. Officers donned protective gear in collecting evidence from the scene, and accounts differ on how Green got some of the powder on his skin. The best guess is that some ended up on his shirt and he wiped it off with his bare hand, reports WKBN. \"Just out of instinct, he tried to brush it off\u2014not thinking,\" says a police captain. Fentanyl can be absorbed through the skin, and Green quickly began suffering the effects. Meanwhile, Justin Buckle, 25, and Cortez Collins, 24, face drug charges after their Friday night arrests.",

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It sure has been an interesting week for Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and things might get worse before they get better. The controversy began last Tuesday when Musk startled his own company board by announcing that he might take Tesla private and, in fact, had \"funding secured.\" Now the SEC is looking into how Musk handled the announcement, and one law professor tells the Wall Street Journal that \"the probability that there will be an SEC enforcement action is, I think, quite high.\" Meanwhile, some bizarre accusations about Musk emerged from rapper Azealia Banks. Coverage: Musk's explanation: On Monday, Musk wrote in a blog that he's been in talks with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund to provide the needed money to take the company private. The post appeared to be an attempt to quell the controversy over his initial tweet, notes the New York Times, which talks to people familiar with the Saudi fund who say a deal is nowhere close. In fact, the story asserts that Musk made his initial tweet with \"little forethought.\" On Monday, Musk also tweeted that he was getting legal and financial advice on a deal from Goldman Sachs and others.",

The parents of 21-year-old Savannah Gold say their suspicions were immediately aroused by the \"really strange\" message they received after she left for work at the Bonefish Grill in Jacksonville last Wednesday, People reports. \"Hey i just wanted to tell you and mom i met a really great guy and we\u2019re running away together,\" one message to her father said. \"I love him and we're leaving tonight i'll call you later when we get to where we are going.\" \"He showed it to me and I immediately knew that it was someone else,\" mother Sharon Gold tells Action News Jax. \"We text each other all day ... and this was not from my daughter.\" Says father Daniel Gold, \"The spelling was all whacked out.\" After Gold's car was found in the restaurant's parking lot with a slashed tire and her purse still inside, authorities identified manager Lee Rodarte, 28, as a suspect because of inconsistencies in his story. Police say Rodarte, who was in an on-again, off-again relationship with Gold, eventually admitted killing her and led them to her body, which he had dumped in a lake. Investigators believe Rodarte was the one who sent the text to Gold's parents. Her parents say after the disappearance, he told them he was worried about her and even helped hand out missing-person flyers. He has been charged with murder and evidence tampering and is being held without bond.",

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It was snowing on Feb. 24, 1944, when Jewish children in the French town of Gemeaux were rounded up at their school. Two sisters, Denise and Micheline L\u00e9vy, aged 10 and 9, clutched dolls\u2014one pink, one blue\u2014as they were led away to Auschwitz. A gendarme grabbed the dolls and flung them to the ground, Le Parisien reports, via the Telegraph. A shopkeeper picked them up and gave them to the grandmother of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Gilles, a 38-year-old schoolteacher, who has now donated them to the Shoah Memorial, the Holocaust museum in Paris. The dolls were among 200 items put on display Sunday, out of 19,000 objects collected by volunteers. In many cases like the L\u00e9vy sisters, they are all that remain of the deported. For two generations, Gilles' family minded the dolls. \"But nobody ever played with them,\" she told the paper. \"We knew their history.\" They tried to find out what happened to the L\u00e9vy sisters, but turned up no clues. Gilles said it seemed wrong to keep the dolls. \"We wanted to give them to a museum, or a place of memorial.\" It was difficult to let them go, she added, \"but it was the best thing we could do for the memory of those little girls.\" Over the past two years, volunteers for the Shoah Memorial criss-crossed France collecting a trove of objects belonging to those deported, including photos, a jersey emblazoned with a Star of David, a violin case, and fading slips of paper noting the Jews in hiding stacked in a little red box, reports Telerama. \"Some preferred that we borrow the objects \u2026 so they could pass them on to their children,\" Shoah curator Lior Lalieu-Smadja told Telerama. \"We understand their choice but, unfortunately, we know that quite often this evidence will be lost.\"",

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Well, it appears the Secret Service has pried Donald Trump's beloved Android phone from his tweeting fingers. An unidentified friend of Trump's tells the AP the new president handed over his phone Thursday on the advice of security advisers. The New York Times reports Trump's Android was replaced by an encrypted device that received Secret Service approval. Barack Obama, the first president to use a mobile device in office, started with a \"heavily modified\" Blackberry before moving to a mostly disabled iPhone. The devices were used to check email and news sites but rarely\u2014if ever\u2014for phone calls. This is all likely to cramp Trump's style. A Republican senator says the president was known for answering his phone even if he didn't recognize the number. He would even call back strange numbers that didn't leave a message. A former Secret Service agent tells Cnet Trump is unlikely to be able to use his new device for phone calls because they are way too easy to intercept. Trump's aides\u2014some of whom are excited journalists and others won't have direct access to him\u2014say he's likely to instead go office to office in person to get his \"gossip\" fix. It's possible he'll still be able to tweet. The Newseum in Washington DC has asked Trump about getting his Android to put on display.",

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The FBI hopes new surveillance footage released today will aid in the recovery of 13 priceless artworks stolen 25 years ago and help put to rest one of Boston's greatest mysteries. In the early hours of March 18, 1990, two men dressed as cops were let into the Gardner Museum, where they tied up two security guards and absconded with the artwork and the museum's security footage, the Boston Globe reports. But the thieves, who have never been identified, may have missed one key thing. According to the FBI, surveillance footage from the day before the robbery shows a security guard letting a man into the museum\u2014against protocol\u2014through the same door later used in the robbery. The Globe reports it's unclear why this footage wasn't viewed by law enforcement earlier, but it could show a \"dry run\" of the heist. The newspaper identifies Richard Abath as the security guard in the footage, and the FBI is hoping the public can help identify the mystery man he lets in. Abath, a rock musician at the time who now lives in Vermont, has claimed he had no part in the robbery, but this new footage appears to contradict a number of his statements. No one has ever been charged with stealing the art\u2014for which there is a $5 million reward\u2014and no one ever will, as the statute of limitations has expired. Someone in possession of the paintings, however, could face charges. Their total value exceeds $500 million, reports AP.",
