A company with just one employee, no assets, and no revenue saw its penny stocks rocket to a $6 billion valuation this summer\u2014enough for the SEC to shut down its trading and launch an investigation, the Wall Street Journal reports. The company, Cynk, runs a website called Introbiz.com designed to help connect people with celebrities and various kinds of professionals. Fair enough\u2014until its stock leaped by 25,000% since June, notes Business Insider. Worse, the company address in Belize City, Belize, is inaccurate (Cynk apologized) and the company's shares have swapped hands three times over six years, always between people who were the CEO and sole employee. More details: Business Insider found someone matching CEO Javier Romero on Facebook and called him up. He answered to Javier until the reporter identified herself, when he said he was really Jason. Javier is \"actually out right now,\" he said. \"I don't really want to disclose his business. I can definitely get a number for you guys.\" Stock manipulation in the penny market is \"extremely common\" and hard to regulate, an expert tells Bloomberg. Another says that \"one percent\" of investors would trade in a company like Cynk\u2014but stock promoters hardly helped, raving on Twitter that the stock \"keeps surging higher!!\" and \"this could be EPIC!!\" The SEC probe is part of its recent crackdown on penny-stock fraud. Over the past two years, the commission has halted trading in over 1,300 companies. The blog Zero Hodge drew attention to the stock this week, quipping, \"Lord Overstone said it best. 'No warning can save people determined to grow suddenly rich.'\"",

The show halted production earlier this week. The workers\u2014who asked to stay anonymous out of fear of ruining their careers\u2014say Spacey targeted young male staffers in a \"predatory\" manner. One former production assistant says he was in a car on the way to the set with Spacey when the actor suddenly put his hands down his pants. The worker says the nonconsensual touching from someone in a \"very powerful position on the show\" left him \"in a state of shock.\" The production assistant says after arriving on set, Spacey cornered him in his trailer and made \"inappropriate contact.\" He says after he told Spacey what he was doing wasn't OK, Spacey became \"flustered\" and left for the rest of the day. House of Cards producer Media Rights Capital says Spacey was reported for sexual harassment in 2012 and it is \"deeply troubled\" by the new allegations, per the Hollywood Reporter. MRC says it has set up a complaint hotline and legal assistance for workers. In a separate allegation, a man who is now 48 tells Vulture that he had a sexual relationship with Spacey when he was 14 and the actor was 24. He says they met around five times and there was a lot of \"physical activity\"\u2014but Spacey then tried to rape him. He says he fought the actor off and fled, and Spacey later broke off contact with him.",

Found in central Victoria's Golden Triangle in Australia by an explorer who wishes to stay anonymous, per ABC.net.au, the gleaming chunk of precious metal, estimated to be worth up to $190,000, was found 12 inches below the surface using what Gizmodo Australia calls a $7,600 Minelab metal detector known as the \"next level of gold detection.\" \"I thought it was rubbish at first, maybe an old horseshoe,\" says the prospector, who's been scouting for buried treasure in his spare time for 10 years with a group of friends, per 9News.

The Dallas Morning News reports that on Friday, the board held a preliminary vote and decided to nix Hillary Clinton from high school history class. As the first woman to nab a major political party's presidential nomination, Clinton appeared alongside Thurgood Marshall and Sandra Day O'Connor, among others, in a \"citizenship\" section of the curriculum in which students were tasked to \"evaluate the contributions of significant political and social leaders in the United States.\" A work group made its recommendations to the board based on a rubric it created on how \"essential\" it was to learn about certain historical figures. Also cut, but from the elementary school curriculum: Helen Keller. \"Helen Keller does not best represent the concept of citizenship,\" the group wrote. \"Military and first responders are best represented.\" By the group's gauge, Clinton received just 5 points out of 20; Keller got 7. Some wonder how much time will really be saved by nixing these notable figures. \"It won't take that long to teach about either woman. they happen to be part of history,\" tweeted pundit Greta Van Susteren. The work group estimates cutting Clinton will save about 30 minutes of teaching time, while yanking Keller will free up 40. What the BOE voted to keep in the state curriculum: references to \"Judeo-Christian values\" and \"a requirement that students explain how the 'Arab rejection of the State of Israel has led to ongoing conflict' in the Middle East,\" per the Morning News. These decisions aren't set in stone: There's still a chance for the BOE to make changes before a final November vote.",

Even some of his own campaign advisers don't feel he was on point enough during the head-to-head, though they're framing it as \"missed opportunities\" rather than total failure.

What these advisers, who spoke anonymously to the paper, are worried about, however, is whether Trump will agree to this prep. Complicating things: Some say he actually was drilled on how to combat Clinton on certain issues and that he just chose not to. Others point the finger at Trump's extremely busy schedule in the days before the debate and too many people (up to a dozen, some with not much political acumen) giving him conflicting suggestions. Sources say his debate training was \"unconventional,\" with Trump unable to concentrate during more traditional sessions and preferring to simply dish with advisers rather than have mock debates. Trump himself told Fox News he found it hard to segue into some of those challenges against Clinton on the debate stage, such as the subject of Benghazi. Trump's pulling back\u2014he stopped attacking Clinton and even grew \"subdued\" as the debate proceeded\u2014has got to change the next time around, frustrated aides say.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Scientists in Canada say they've found a way to trick the heart, making it behave as if it were the beneficiary of exercise even if no exercise was able to be done. According to a study in Cell Research, the Ottawa researchers discovered that protein cardiotrophin 1 (CT1) can fuel healthy heart growth, repair heart damage, and cause the heart to pump more blood in cases of left heart failure, as a result of heart attack, and right heart failure, as a result of high blood pressure in the lungs, reports Medical News Today. It's a big deal since medications used to treat left heart failure don't work on right heart failure, which usually requires a heart transplant, per a release. Exercise can be beneficial because it boosts the heart's ability to pump blood, but \"people with heart failure usually can't exercise,\" researcher Lynn Megeney tells the Ottawa Citizen. The heart usually responds by expanding, irreversibly, in an unhealthy way. But that's why CT1 is \"very exciting,\" Megeney says. It \"causes heart muscles to grow in a more healthy way and it also stimulates blood vessel growth in the heart,\" increasing blood flow just like with exercise. And just like with exercise, the heart returns to its original size afterward. Megeney says the discovery could lead to fewer heart transplants, but he says it could be two or three years before researchers begin clinical trials on humans and, assuming they go well, a decade before treatment is available to the public.

The timing dovetails with the end of Ramadan. \u201cThere is a significant threat stream and we\u2019re reacting to it,\u201d Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, tells ABC News for its This Week program.

Peter King made a similar point to CNN: The information is \"the most specific I've seen,\" he says, adding, \"We are focused on the Middle East, but it's a potential series of attacks that really could be almost anyplace.\"",

The victims' argument centers around the marketing campaign behind the AR-15, which the mother of one 6-year-old victim tells CBS News was \"morally reprehensible.\" The lawsuit claims Remington linked \"the AR-15 to macho vigilantism and military-style insurrection\" in order to target a \"younger demographic\" and increase sales. One AR-15 ad included the tagline \"consider your man card reissued.\" Another ad touted it as \"the ultimate combat weapons system,\" according to Reuters. Josh Koskoff, lawyer for the victims' families, compared it to \"the Ford Motor Company advertising a car that can run over people\" and said that kind of advertising attracts \"dangerous users,\" including Lanza. \"Adam Lanza heard their message,\" Koskoff told the justices Tuesday. \"He idolized the military and Remington advertised the AR-15 as the weapon used by Army Rangers.\" He says Remington \"knew exactly what they were doing\" with its marketing strategies. James Vogts, lawyer for Remington, says the company is protected by the 2005 Lawful Commerce in Arms Act that shields gun makers from liability in shootings. \"No matter how much we wished those children and teachers were still alive, the law needs to be applied,\" Vogts told justices. Following Tuesday's arguments, justices will decide whether the families' lawsuit can go to trial.",

We now know Microsoft's answer: The computing giant released a 30-slide presentation today arguing that the move will improve Microsoft's margins on Windows phones, which will allow it to invest more in the platform, which will accelerate sales and market share growth, the Washington Post reports. But John Herrman at Buzzfeed has another explanation: \"Fear of dying alone.\" Here's what he and other pundits are saying: The presentation \"manages to sound both insane and uninspiring, outlining modest goals that still sound unrealistic,\" Herman argues\u2014like capturing a whole 15% of the smartphone market. \"It's a fitting end for the close of Microsoft's Ballmer era, during which the company \u2026 missed out on the most important change in consumer electronics in decades\" while remaining profitable in unglamorous ways. Like everyone, Microsoft is trying to ape the Apple model, MobileOpportunity observes. But it's not so sure that's a good idea. \"There already is an apple,\" the blog points out, and other software/hardware hybrid companies, like Palm and BlackBerry, have been crushed under its heel. Maybe Microsoft should have tried to patch up its tried-and-true strategy of licensing its OS. The move risks complicating Microsoft's crucial relationships with other PC and device manufacturers, one analyst tells ZDNet. But he adds that \"Microsoft needed to make a bold move\" or face \"certain terminal decline,\" and that the price it paid for Nokia \"seems extremely reasonable.\" Meanwhile, Matthew Yglesias at Slate digs up a fairly interesting memo from Nokia CEO (and, perhaps, Microsoft heir apparent) Stephen Elop, in which he uses the story of a Deepwater Horizon worker leaping from the burning oil platform\u2014a seemingly desperate, yet necessary move\u2014to explain the company's shift from its own failed OS to Windows Phone. Of course, Yglesias notes, that move \"was basically a total failure.\" To read the full parable, click here.",

That fact didn't stop Steve Aisthorpe of Scotland from his recent mission on the Nepal-Tibet border: to get \"closure\" on the fate of Kristinn Runarsson and Thorsteinn Gudjonsson, friends and fellow climbers who vanished during a 1988 expedition with him. Aisthorpe, who the Guardian notes found out just a few weeks ago his friends' bodies had been seen at the end of a glacier on Pumori mountain, recalls on the Church of Scotland's website how his group started as four climbers in October of that year, though one of the men fell ill early on and dropped out. Aisthorpe, then 26, came down with the flu, and so he climbed back down on Oct. 16, 1988, to seek medical attention. When Aisthorpe realized he was in no condition to attempt the climb, he sent a message back to Runarsson and Gudjonsson, both 27 and from Iceland: \"Feel free\" to go for the summit without him. The two men were never seen alive again after Oct. 18. When Aisthorpe finally felt well enough to head back to the last camp where he'd left his friends, \"my calls echoed from the rocks and ice before fading. \u2026 the silence was palpable.\" Fast-forward 30 years, when an American climber spotted their bodies just last month; a group of local climbers brought the remains down. Among those at the cremation ceremony in Kathmandu for the men was Runarsson\u2019s 30-year-old son; Runarsson\u2019s fiancee had been pregnant when the father of her child was lost to Pumori.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 If it works, it could be an air-traveling perk to trump all others: no more jet lag. Airbus is making the bold claim that it can at least reduce the malady for those aboard its new A350 XWB line of jets. The main tool is a set of LED lights within the cabin that mimics natural shifts in sunlight and theoretically keeps people's natural circadian rhythms in sync, reports Fast Company. Another factor: Because of the planes' relatively light frames, they can be pressurized to 6,000 feet, which the airline says allows for more humidity and makes the air pressure inside the aircraft closer to the pressure on the ground than is the case with most jets, per Quartz. A third factor is the jet's filtration system, which replaces the air in the cabin in its entirety every two to three minutes. The idea there is that, if nothing else, the improved air quality should help people sleep better on long flights. And the big question: Has it worked? It's a little too early to tell. The first such jet landed in the US only earlier this month via Qatar Airways, though other airlines plan to add the jet to their fleets, notes a post at Science Alert.

The Airbus A320 coming into London from Geneva had 132 passengers and five crew members aboard, a BA spokesman tells CNN; the incident was reported after the BA pilot touched down. \"Our aircraft landed safely, was fully examined by our engineers and it was cleared to operate its next flight,\" the rep says. No arrests have been made (it's unclear whose drone it may have been), and the aviation security arm of the Metropolitan Police is looking into the matter. Police note that flying a drone too close to a plane is illegal, NBC News reports, with punishment including up to five years in prison. Specifically, drones over 15 pounds can't fly higher than 400 feet and aren't permitted to fly \"beyond the direct unaided line of sight\" of its operator or near crowds or buildings. Not that the incident came as a total surprise: The head of the International Air Transport Association had previously noted the \"real and growing threat\" of a drone-plane hit, while a British Airline Pilots Association rep says it was \"only a matter of time.\" A recent study by Bard College's Center for the Study of the Drone underscores the danger in US airspace, with 327 \"close encounters\" of drones flying within 500 feet of manned aircraft between December 2013 and September 2015, and at least 28 pilots \"[maneuvering] to avoid a collision with a drone.\" Frighteningly, aviation experts say they don't really know what would happen if a drone got sucked into a plane's engine, a Civil Aviation Authority rep tells NBC.

The USS George Washington and two US cruisers have arrived in the Philippines and will distribute food, water, and medicine, as well as assist search and rescue operations in what the top US commander in the Philippines tells the BBC will be an American aid effort on an unprecedented scale. US planes are bringing in supplies and a medical ship is on the way; Britain is also sending an aircraft carrier, notes the BBC. In other developments: Supplies from the US and other countries are arriving, but some areas are still in desperate need of relief and \"the major challenge is logistics,\" a European Commission spokesman tells the LA Times. \"With all this aid arriving and at the same time, the various Philippine authorities\u2014military, civilian structures, the Philippine Red Cross\u2014trying to distribute aid to so many communities ... obviously there are bottlenecks.\" Lawlessness in the devastated city of Tacloban is also slowing the distribution of aid, the Guardian finds.

Communist rebels have declared a ceasefire in disaster areas, but troops say there has been at least one attack. Some 2,357 people have been confirmed dead, but the toll is expected to rise significantly as remote areas hit hard by the storm are reached. In Tacloban, where bodies are being trucked to mass graves, the city administrator says he is sticking by his original estimate of 10,000 dead in the city alone. In a smaller city south of Tacloban, the devastation is even worse and a 16-member medical team from California is laboring in extreme conditions to help survivors, NBC finds. The volunteer surgeons\u2014working by flashlight in Tanawan's ruined town hall\u2014believe the region will need help for months. \"I don\u2019t know when or how we are going to be able to leave,\" one doctor says. \"This is just the beginning of a wave of misery.\" USA Today has more on that front: The few doctors in Manila are already overwhelmed with hundreds of patients\u2014and those are mostly minor injuries. They're soon expecting to see big problems like pneumonia, diarrhea, infections, and dehydration.

Hundreds of people were evacuated from L'Enfant Plaza station\u2014one of the Metro network's busiest\u2014and from a Yellow Line train that was stuck in a tunnel, the Washington Post reports. At least two of the injured are in critical condition, and officials say the name of the woman who died will not be released until next of kin have been notified. The NTSB's investigator in charge says the cause appears to have been an \"arcing event\" in which electricity jumped from the system's third rail, reports the New York Times. Water in the tunnel may have been a contributing factor, he says. Passengers who were on the stuck train described scenes of panic as the smoke grew thicker before firefighters arrived to help them escape by walking through the tunnel back to the station. \"We couldn't see anything. The visibility was poor,\" a passenger waiting to be taken to a hospital told NBC. \"Everybody got as low as they possibly could to the ground, because that's where the best possibility for oxygen was.\" One firefighter is among the injured. Meanwhile: The Hollywood Reporter picks up on a social media oops from Netflix series House of Cards. In a nod to a season 2 episode, it last night tweeted, \"Consider the slate clean,\" alongside a photo of an empty DC subway station and a fake news headline reading \"Train Traffic Tragedy.\" An odd coincidence: New York City's Penn Station was forced to delay trains early today on the heels of a three-alarm fire that has been dubbed \"suspicious.\" It occurred at a construction site near the Long Island Rail Road concourse's west end around 2:30am.

Authorities in Wisconsin say that his weapon of choice was a circular saw and that the slaying unfolded while the two were part of a crew working atop a home outside the city of River Falls on Aug. 6. Per the criminal complaint cited by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, police say the victim handed Navarro the saw moments before Navarro sliced Valles-Flores' throat. Valles-Flores then fell onto an adjoining room, where he was discovered dead. A circular saw was found at the scene. In a recorded phone call from jail following his arrest, Navarro allegedly said he was being teased by his co-workers prior to the attack and that it made him feel \"really mad inside.\" However, a relative of Valles-Flores told reporters the two men had known each other for years and would frequently poke fun at one another. Navarro is being held in lieu of $500,000 bond and has a hearing set for Monday.",

The same vitamin credited with helping the brain and nervous system\u2014B12\u2014is now accused of contributing to acne, reports the Independent. A new UCLA study suggests a link, though researchers emphasized that more research needs to be done to confirm what's actually happening. Still, the findings \"could raise questions about whether people with acne should take vitamin B12 supplements,\" observes Live Science. It seems that the vitamin changes the way skin bacteria behaves, which promotes inflammation, which in turn leads to pimples. Some people are more vulnerable than others. \"This study does present some compelling evidence suggesting that supplementation with B12 can cause or exacerbate acne in a subset of individuals,\" says a co-author of the study. She emphasizes that the research shows correlation, not causation. While previous studies have linked the vitamin to acne flareups, this is the first to provide details on how it interacts on a molecular level with bacteria, especially Propionibacterium acnes. One upside of the research is that it might eventually lead to better acne medication, reports the Verge. (Kids may be getting too many vitamins in cereal.)",

But drugmaker Mylan has hiked the price of the device by nearly 500% over the past few years, CBS News reports, and parents and doctors aren't happy. \"When epinephrine only costs a few cents, but they're going up to $500, personally I don't think that's ethically responsible,\" allergy specialist Dr. Douglas McMahon told NBC News. \u201cPatients are calling and saying they can't afford it.\u201d (McMahon is seeking FDA approval for his own device that he says will cost $50.)

With a near monopoly, Mylan has little incentive to cut the price, Bloomberg reports. In fact, Mylan execs considered dumping the aging product in 2007. Instead, they launched a marketing campaign that turned the device into an essential, donating EpiPens to schools and dropping $35 million on TV ads. A law passed by Congress in 2013 requiring schools to stock epinephrine devices also boosted sales, which last year totaled $1 billion. Mylan contends it has made a \"significant investment\" to improve the device and offers coupons. \"It's a totally established brand name with little competition,\" Bloomberg\u2019s Robert Langreth tells CBS. \"That gives them freedom to raise the price every year.\"",

Researchers had volunteers rate comments made by officers during the traffic stops in terms of respectfulness and more, per the Los Angeles Times. The BBC reports respectful behavior by officers included apologizing, showing an interest in the person, and saying \"drive safely.\" Disrespectful behavior included asking questions, calling the person \"bro\" or \"man,\" and using words that have a negative connotation. The study found officers were 57% more likely to use one of the most respectful phrases with white people and 61% more likely to use one of the most disrespectful phrases with black people. For example, white people were more likely to be called \"sir\" or \"ma'am,\" while black people were more likely to be called by their first names. Officers were also found to be less polite, formal, friendly, and impartial with black people. The race of the officer didn't appear to change things. \"These routine interactions are important,\" researcher Jennifer Eberhardt says, per the BBC. \"They're the way most people encounter the police.\" And if those encounters go poorly, citizens may become less supportive or cooperative toward police.

Had they wanted a ban, they'd possibly face a steep slope. In a June report to the UN, Denmark agreed with Egypt's stance that it is a parental right to circumcise one's male child, reports the Copenhagen Post. Still, the Local reports that 74% of respondents to a 2014 survey said they'd support a full or partial ban.

Today the oath, administered by Chief Justice John Roberts, went off a little more smoothly than it did during Obama's first inauguration, though the AtlanticWire points out it wasn't error-free. And the flub this time was Obama's. While reciting the phrase \"The office of the president of the United States,\" he effectively choked on the last word, saying just \"Sta\u2014,\" and making a little face after doing so. In other oath-taking tidbits, the president placed his hand on two Bibles: one Abraham Lincoln's and the other Martin Luther King's. (Prof. Cornel West wasn't thrilled about the latter choice, notes the National Review: West slammed the use of King's \"prophetic fire as just a moment in presidential pageantry.\") Joe Biden, meanwhile, again took the oath from Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the Wall Street Journal notes. Among other highlights of the ceremony thus far: The Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir performed \"Battle Hymn of the Republic,\" James Taylor sang \"America the Beautiful,\" and civil rights leader Myrlie Evers-Williams offered the invocation.",

First, the funeral director who prepared Martin's body for burial said he observed no signs of a struggle, reports CBS News. Aside from the gunshot wound to the chest, \"We could see no physical signs like there had been a scuffle,\" he explained. \"The hands\u2014I didn't see any knuckles, bruises, or what have you. And that is something we would have covered up if it would have been there.\" Also: The mother of a key 13-year-old eyewitness in the case says that police pressured her son to tell them details he hadn't seen, reports the New York Daily News. He saw just one person in the grass, she says, and couldn't tell who it was \"because it was too dark.\" But the police persisted, giving the boy a multiple choice question about the color of the sweater he saw. Of the three options, he told them he thought it might be red\u2014the color Zimmerman was wearing. \"I believe he felt pressured to give the color,\" says mom. An anonymous eyewitness spoke to Anderson Cooper last night. He says Zimmerman didn't seem injured as he walked away. More news from the past: Zimmerman was fired in 2005 from an under-the-counter security guard job because he \"had a temper and he became a liability,\" a former co-worker tells the New York Daily News. The man described Zimmerman as \"like Jekyll and Hyde,\" saying, \"When the dude snapped, he snapped. He definitely loved being in charge. He loved the power. Still, I could never see him killing someone. Never,\" he said.",

Mohawk, a 13-year-old lion who was one of Nairobi National Park's most well-known creatures due to his trademark mane and rep as somewhat of a \"ladies' lion,\" had escaped from an unfenced section of the park and ended up in the town of Isinya, where he was promptly surrounded by a jeering group of men, the Washington Post reports.

The wildlife service already had an animal management team on the scene, but those rangers had only rifles, not tranquilizers. After Mohawk pounced on the bystander, the rangers felt they couldn't wait for a second team on its way with tranqs\u2014so they unleashed what the Star says was nine bullets, leaving the animal \"roaring and writhing in pain\" as he died. \"If the rangers had the right equipment, this lion would not have died,\" a local resident tells the paper. \"You can't keep a lion in the midst of people for so many hours without stressing it. We blame them for this heinous act.\" The shooting has prompted plenty of backlash on social media, including a #JusticeForMohawk hashtag, but the wildlife service says it had no choice once the lion started attacking humans. \"This action was taken as a last resort after an escalation of the situation and a concern for public safety,\" the Kenya Wildlife Service says, per CNN. A bunch of lions have busted out of the park lately, driven by what conservationists say is the noise from development projects, including a highway being built through the park.

Beyond that, however, the recommendations get muddled, notes Timothy Noah on Slate: Shovels that make it easier to gather the snow make it harder to lift the snow, and vice versa. There is one obscure shovel supposedly better suited to both parts of the job, but good luck finding one in a hardware store. A few other things will lessen your risk: Don\u2019t start shoveling while snow is still falling (it\u2019s colder, so you\u2019ll put additional strain on your heart); don\u2019t bundle up too much (getting too hot isn\u2019t good, either); and don\u2019t drink coffee (it increases your heart rate) or hot cocoa (who knows why?) right before shoveling.

Something had been smoked in the pipe bowls and stems unearthed from William Shakespeare' garden in Stratford-upon-Avon; the question was what. Researchers in South Africa now have gas chromatography mass spectrometry to thank for their answer. A piece in the Conversation based on the report published in the South African Journal of Science explains the \"technique is very sensitive to residues that can be preserved in pipes even if they had been smoked 400 years ago.\" Eight of the 24 pipe-fragment samples tested were shown to contain cannabis; another had evidence of nicotine, and two more \"evidence for Peruvian cocaine from coca leaves.\" Of those, only four of the cannabis samples were from Shakespeare's garden; the others were from the Stratford-upon-Avon area. Study author Francis Thackeray writes that the research establishes that a wide range of plants were smoked in the area during the early 17th century, and he leans on Shakespeare's own words to try to draw connections. Thackeray references Sonnet 76, which refers to \"invention in a noted weed\"; he interprets weed as cannabis and invention as writing. As for whether we can conclude that Shakespeare got high, Thackeray writes \"one can well imagine\" it. (In April, Texas researchers reported another Shakespeare find.)",

Wildlife officials accuse Premchai Karnasuta\u2014ranked by Forbes as the country's 35th richest person, with an estimated net worth of $240 million\u2014of poaching a leopard and other animals in the Thungyai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary in the country's west. AFP reports rangers came up on the camp set up by Premchai, 63, and three others and found 10 carcasses of protected species, including a black leopard, a Kalij pheasant, and a red muntjac. The group was arrested Feb. 4, reports the Bangkok Post. Human excrement was found there, too, and officials say that its presence near the camp is noteworthy. They don't believe Premchai\u2014who made his fortune in construction and heads the Italian-Thai Development Company, which erected Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport\u2014would have strayed far from the camp when nature called. It's not the only test being conducted: Elephant tusks found in his Bangkok home will be analyzed to determine whether they came from Africa illegally. The Post reports on another potential clue: Two pellets identified via X-ray in the pheasant carcass will be tested and compared to the firearms taken from the suspects, who have denied the allegations. Premchai has a March 26 court date; wary of any potential attempt to flee, Thailand's immigration checkpoints have been told to keep watch for him.

Its predecessor ruled the box office in 2016, but does this sequel from David Leitch\u2014which cost a stuntwoman her life\u2014have the power to do the same? It seems so, with the movie getting a solid 85% positive rating from critics and audiences alike at Rotten Tomatoes. Here's what critics are saying: \"If you love films that keep you guessing, laughing and surprised on the edge of your seat, this is a must-see,\" writes Colin Covert at the Minneapolis Star Tribune. \"More gory, bizarre, offbeat and even obscenely funny than the original,\" the film \"revels in its self-referential perspective\" while Reynolds \"radiates a bizarre charisma,\" Covert writes. Not to be outdone is a \"delightful\" Zazie Beetz as lucky superhero Domino. \"There's no way it could equal the freshness and irreverence of the 2016 original. Fortunately, the sequel comes off as much more than a cash grab,\" writes Calvin Wilson at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. He mostly credits Reynolds. In \"the role of his dreams,\" the actor \"totally sells the character's blend of reckless self-absorption and reluctant heroics.\" Even so, \"another sequel really isn't necessary, but it's in the works anyway.\" Jen Yamato wasn't as impressed. \"While the sequel benefits from Reynolds' superhuman charisma,\" it \"merely rehashes and recycles the same wink-wink barbs that worked the first time around\" and offers \"uninspired plotting,\" she writes at the Los Angeles Times. Thank goodness for Celine Dion. Her music brings \"new life, emotion and a winking, self-aware wit into the action,\" Yamato says. The movie \"comes blazing out of the shoot, but dips in its second hour, like a stretched-out piece of taffy,\" writes Adam Graham at Detroit News. \"Still, there is a lot left to like here, and Reynolds and company crank out better, more outrageous laughs than most pure comedies. You'll laugh loud and you'll laugh hard.\"",

Beginning her film career in 1947's A New Oath, Choi became one of South Korea's leading actresses in the 1950s and '60s and one of the country's first female directors, reports Screen Daily. By 1976, she'd appeared in more than 130 films, and apparently caught the eye of future North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. That year, while in Hong Kong, Choi was kidnapped by agents working for Kim, who believed she could help elevate North Korea's film industry, reports the BBC. Months later, Choi's ex-husband, director Shin Sang-ok, was also kidnapped when he went to Hong Kong to look for her.

And it wasn't just an extremely rare occurrence for the hospital: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention logged only 24 births involving quintuplets or more among the US' almost 4 million live births in 2015, reports the AP. The Times-Dispatch reports Taiwo was 30 weeks and 2 days along at delivery and was released after a week in the hospital. \"I hope for the smallest of my six children to grow up and say, 'I was so small, and look at me now,'\" she says. A hospital press release explains that four heartbeats appeared during the couple's first ultrasound in November; it wasn't until January that they learned the four heartbeats were actually six. (This birth story garnered extensive press coverage this month, but for tragic reasons.)",

The Daily Beast reports that when Michael Cohen, special counsel for the Trump Organization, was asked about an alleged incident from 1989 involving Trump's ex-wife Ivana, he claimed \"that by the very definition, you can't rape your spouse\"\u2014and then threatened reporter Tim Mak, allegedly telling him to \"tread very f---ing lightly, because what I'm going to do to you is going to be f---ing disgusting.\" \"You write a story that has Mr. Trump's name in it, with the word 'rape,' and I'm going to mess your life up ... for as long as you're on this frickin' planet,\" Cohen warned, per the Beast, which notes that New York outlawed marital rape in 1984. The alleged incident Cohen was asked about was described in the 1993 Trump biography Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump, reports the New York Daily News. The book, citing a divorce deposition, describes an incident in which Trump allegedly forced himself on Ivana as revenge for her having talked him into failed scalp-reduction surgery, though the book contains a statement from her saying that while she referred to the incident as \"rape,\" she doesn't want her words \"to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense.\" A Trump spokesperson tells Business Insider that the incident is \"old news and it never happened\" and that Ivana made it up to \"exploit\" Trump during divorce proceedings.",

Rickman had hinted at that fact in interviews, Mashable reports, but he never revealed exactly what Rowling told him\u2014but now Rowling finally has, thanks to a fan on Twitter who asked her, \"Will you tell us the piece of information that you told Alan Rickman about Severus Snape? Or will that forever be a secret?\" As the Independent explains, Rickman once said that Rowling didn't reveal the entire ending of the series to him, but rather gave him \"one little piece of information, which I always said I would never share with anybody and never have, and never will,\" and that helped him \"travel down that road rather than that one or that one or that one.\" Rowling's response to the aforementioned fan explains what that \"one little piece\" was: \"I told Alan what lies behind the word 'always,'\" she wrote. Spoiler alert part 2: She's referring to the fact that, as Snape reveals to Dumbledore toward the end of the series, he's \"always\" loved Harry's mother, and thus felt compelled to protect Harry.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Renowned German art dealer Alfred Flechtheim had been named part of the \"Jewish world conspiracy\" in the Nazi press even before 1933, so when Adolf Hitler came to power, he chose to flee, and died 4 years later in London, reports Courthouse News. His art collection remained in Berlin and at least eight paintings are now part of the Bavarian State Paintings Collection, reports the Art Newspaper. They should instead be with Flechtheim's heirs in the US and England, per a lawsuit filed against the state of Bavaria in US District Court in Manhattan on Monday. The widow of Flechtheim's sole heir (his nephew) and the nephew's son cite \"a presumption of international law\" that sales of Jewish property after Jan. 30, 1933, aren't legitimate because they were made under duress. And so in the case of the six paintings by Max Beckmann and two others by Juan Gris and Paul Klee, timing is the issue. The Bavarian State Paintings Collection argues the paintings, worth up to $20 million, were sold by Flechtheim in 1932. Penny Hulton of England and stepson Michael Hulton of San Francisco\u2014who've been locked in a years-long battle with Bavaria over what Deutsche Welle calls \"one of the world's most disputed estates\"\u2014say the paintings were sold after he left the country in May 1933. They \"would have remained accessible to Flechtheim but for the climate at the time,\" their lawyer tells Reuters. \"The state-level program of Aryanizing Jewish businesses made the confiscation possible.\" (These Jewish heirs want back their gold and jewels.)",

But those moves weren't enough to turn the financial tide after decades of plummeting ad revenue. \"There\u2019s a level of ambition that we can\u2019t achieve alone,\" his son and company president, Gus Wenner, tells the Times. \"So we are being proactive ... Publishing is a completely different industry than what it was.\" Gus Wenner, who crafted the sale, and his father say they'd like to stay on, though they recognize the new buyer might wish otherwise. But Jann Wenner concedes that \"it's time for young people\" to have a crack at running the glossy known for its edgy pieces\u2014but badly bruised by a $3 million libel verdict over the botched University of Virginia gang rape story. The sale process is just beginning. One candidate is American Media, which recently bought Wenner Media's other titles, Us Weekly and Men's Journal. Music critic Anthony DeCurtis worries over the magazine's future. \"That sense of the magazine editor\u2019s hands on the magazine,\" he tells the Times, \"that\u2019s what\u2019s going to get lost here.\" (Vanity Fair announced its own \"changing of the guard.\")",

Scientists say it formed a mere 700 million years after the Big Bang, and it could shed further light on how the universe came to be. The BBC adds this little mind-bender: \"Because it takes light so long to travel from the outer edge of the universe to us, the galaxy appears as it was 13.1 billion years ago.\" Not mind-bending enough? Try this from the Washington Post: \"We\u2019re looking 95 percent of the way back to the Big Bang. To put that into human terms, that would be like an 80-year-old watching a video of himself on his fourth birthday.\" The discovery comes courtesy of images taken by the Hubble Telescope and follow-up analysis by astronomers at the Keck Observatory in Hawaii. One weird quirk of the galaxy: It produces stars at a much faster clip than our own, a trait that might have been more typical in the early days of the universe. So can we go even further back?

Her family says she weighs more than 1,100 pounds, which would make her the heaviest woman alive\u2014the current Guinness record-holder is only 643 pounds\u2014and close to the heaviest woman ever, according to the Washington Post. While Abd El Aty's weight hasn't been confirmed, Dr. Muffazal Lakdawala in India estimates she is at least 990 pounds based on photos of her. \"My initial reaction was '\u2018How is she even alive?'\" he says. His next reaction was to try to save her. Abd El Aty is expected to arrive in Mumbai for surgery in the next 10 days, but it won't be an easy journey. \"In every sense, she's a challenge,\" Lakdawala says. The bariatric surgeon has been raising money to get her to Mumbai and will be operating pro bono, the Times of India reports. But it's not just money that's an issue. Because she can't leave her room, Abd El Aty was unable to make it to the Indian embassy to be fingerprinted for a visa; only a personal plea from Lakdawala secured her an exemption. And while transporting Abd El Aty will be challenging in its own right, Lakdawala says the surgery itself is \"very high risk.\" He says he's \"hopeful\" but not \"confident\" he can help Abd El Aty lose up to 300 pounds.

It was billed as the unveiling of a \"peace plan,\" but Assad offered essentially no concessions and spent much of the speech justifying his bloody crackdown. And there may be repercussions: In it, he dismissed the work of UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, saying, \"Everyone who comes to Syria knows that Syria accepts advice, but not orders,\" and the New York Times predicts such remarks might cause Brahimi to wash his hands of the conflict. That would present the US and other \"Friends of Syria\" with a quandary: Get more involved, or potentially watch the conflict continue indefinitely. And though celebratory gunfire rang out afterward, even some loyalists were unimpressed. \"It sounded more like gloating than making promises,\" one Assad supporter tells Reuters. \"Everything he suggests now, it is too late. The rebels aren't going to stop.\" Indeed, hours after the speech, fresh clashes broke out along the road to Damascus' international airport, and regime artillery reportedly hit a district just three miles from where Assad spoke. One Assad critic in a hard-hit district agreed that the speech meant little. \"Here, no one cares about this speech. They care about food and electricity.\"",

Australia's ABC reports that in a new study, 82% of participants saw their peanut allergies cured within the first 18 months of treatment. Four years later, 80% of the participants still showed no signs of an allergy, and 70% passed a further test meant to confirm long-term peanut tolerance, the Guardian reports. The research out of Australia's Murdoch Childrens Research Institute involved 48 children, some of whom were given an immunotherapy treatment and some of whom got a placebo. The children who still appeared to be cured four years later \"had been eating peanut freely in their diet without having to follow any particular program of peanut intake,\" says Mimi Tang, the lead researcher. Tang, an immunologist and allergist, combined a probiotic with a method known as peanut oral immunotherapy\u2014a high dose of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus was combined with peanut protein in increasing amounts. The probiotic is known to calm the immune system and reduce allergic reactions; the idea is to \"reprogram\" the way the immune system reacts to peanut intake, Tang explains. She hopes to have a product to market within five years, the Age reports. \"For the first time, we could have products on the market that provide meaningful and long-lasting treatment benefits, which allow sufferers to eat peanut products without thinking about it, as part of a regular diet,\" says the CEO of a biotech firm working on a treatment doctors will be able to prescribe, per 9News.
