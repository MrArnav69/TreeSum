That's the name of the newly proposed \"first nation state in space.\" Named after a world in Norse mythology that's located in the sky, the would-be extraterrestrial state stems from a project led by Russian scientist Igor Ashurbeyli, who heads UNESCO's Science of Space committee, reports the Telegraph. There's no terra firma for Asgardian citizens to travel to: The Guardian reports Asgardia appears to \"consist of a single satellite,\" planned to be launched by the project next year. Ashurbeyli explains \"physically the citizens of that nation state will be on Earth,\" meaning they'll be a citizen of their own country and Asgardia simultaneously. CNET frames Asgardia as a \"scientific, legal, and technological experiment,\" with Ashurbeyli planning to petition the UN for the status of state once 100,000 people have applied to be citizens on the Asgardia website, which launched Wednesday. Among the project's ambitious goals: to create a state-of-the-art protective shield to keep space debris and asteroids from reaching Earth's surface. Space regulation is another focus: Since the late 1960s, the Outer Space Treaty has assigned liability for objects sent into space on the nation launching them. Asgardia could in theory \"do an end-run around government regulations that are a key part of making the treaty work by forming a new government accountable to nobody but the space enthusiasts that formed it,\" observes CNET. (See what NASA did in space earlier this year.)",

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Washington is braced for the first government shutdown in 17 years, which will happen at midnight tonight unless lawmakers manage to break the deadlock over funding and hammer out a deal. Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House\u2014but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight\u2014which appears to be the likeliest scenario\u2014the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month\u2014and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon\u2014but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day\u2014and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University\u2019s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks. But for the Washington area, this is a tsunami.\"",

Jacob Goulet, 16, was last seen Friday night after he left a friend's house during a torrential rainstorm, WMUR reports. His family reported him missing Saturday morning. A Massachusetts State Police helicopter spotted a body floating in the Merrimack River in neighboring Tyngsboro on Sunday morning. A positive ID is pending, but cops said they believe the body is Jacob's. \"Our thoughts and prayers are with Jacob\u2019s family, friends, classmates,\" Nashua Police wrote on Twitter. Cops were investigating why the sewer cover was open. They described a steep drop into a storm drain that links to a water treatment plant. During heavy rains an overflow system discharges water directly into the river. A frantic search began Saturday morning after a passerby spotted the open sewer and beside it a baseball cap and umbrella believed to be Jacob's. Surveillance video confirmed the teen was in the area, WMUR reports. Jacob's family searched storm drains across the city, hoping perhaps he was trapped inside one and would hear their shouts. \"Maybe he might have fallen in and he\u2019s just hanging on, and maybe he\u2019s too cold to yell,\" his uncle, Darren Blouin, told WMUR. Devastated family and friends recalled Jacob, who recently turned 16, as a good kid who avoided trouble and liked video games. \"Jacob is a sweet boy with a great heart,\u201d family friend Lauren Comeau told the Boston Globe. \"He is his father Billy\u2019s whole world.\" (A freak hammock accident killed this teen.)",

The Guardian reports Bellingcat and investigative partner the Insider say they have identified one of the men accused of poisoning the Skripals with novichok as a colonel with Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU. That man is Col. Anatoliy Chepiga, who fought in the war in Chechnya and in 2014 received the state's highest award: Hero of the Russian Federation. The BBC notes the award is generally given by Vladimir Putin, who has previously stated that Boshirov and companion Alexander Petrov are merely civilians; the men have said they traveled to Salisbury as tourists to see a well known cathedral there. Bellingcat suspects the mission that spurred that honor was a secret one; while most recipients' heroics are described in detail, Chepiga simply received his award \"by decree from the Russian president.\" As for how the alleged identification came to be, Bellingcat explains a source suggested it look at whether the men could have attended the Far Eastern Military Command Academy, which had \"the best reputation for foreign-language training and overseas clandestine operations.\" It came upon a photo that it thought could be Boshirov and continued its web searching, which ultimately led it to Chepiga's name and passport file. A 2003 photo in the file \"strongly resembled a younger 'Boshirov.'\" The BBC had this to say: \"British officials have not commented.

The 75-year-old had a stab wound to his neck, and investigators believe his death was the result of a robbery gone wrong. His wife says she went out for a nature walk and discovered his body upon returning home around 4pm Sunday, per the Star. Bradley Martin, identifiable by a colorful handkerchief he often had peeking out of his jacket pocket, was a major figure within the wildlife conservation movement who'd risen to prominence by going undercover, usually posing as a buyer, to expose the illegal market for ivory and rhino horn. A former UN special envoy for rhino conservation, Bradley Martin began his efforts in earnest in the 1970s, when the number of elephants being slaughtered for their ivory spiked. That's when he left the US for Kenya, and his work helped put an end to the sales of rhino horn and ivory in China. His travels also took him to Vietnam and Laos, where last year he and another researcher revealed the latter country's ivory trade was the fastest growing in the world. Their work there involved the dangerous ploy of pretending they were buyers and staying in a casino frequented by organized-crime members and traffickers, all so they could find out what the going price for ivory was. Local police say they've already questioned a cook and gardener at Bradley Martin's home and have come up empty so far on suspects.",

Afterward, the doctor asked the family to use a stethoscope to confirm that Tine's heart had stopped.

Data has revealed that the cumulative amount of radioactive particles released into the atmosphere had reached levels that apply to a Level 7 incident, reports the AP. So what is that estimate? According to two estimates, the equivalent of about 500,000 terabecquerels of radiation from iodine-131 has been released. The Level 7 threshold is \"several tens of thousands of terabecquerels.\" But all 7s are not created alike: The Wall Street Journal notes that officials were careful to say this this is still not a Chernobyl-size disaster. \"The amount of released radiation is about a tenth of Chernobyl\"\u2014about 5.2 million terabecquerels\u2014said a rep for Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Experts have long suggested that fiber keeps us feeling full because it takes a long time to digest, but new research challenges that notion\u2014and may point the way to a new anti-hunger pill. The key is a short-chain fatty acid called acetate, which emerges as fiber is digested. Acetate then makes its way to the brain's hypothalamus, where it builds up and triggers chemical reactions that tell us we're full, Time reports. Researchers reached this conclusion by scanning the progress of a dietary fiber called inulin through the bodies of mice. Those mice who ate fatty diets rich in inulin gained less weight than mice who didn't eat inulin. But one electrophysiologist not related to the study points out that the mice were fed dietary fiber levels of about 11%. He tells Nature that at such a level, \"the room would be full of mouse farts\"\u2014and perhaps the mice were eating less because they felt gassy. The researchers plan to next test the idea in humans. So could we eventually see an acetate-based diet pill? It's possible, the Telegraph suggests: \"The major challenge is to develop an approach that will deliver the amount of acetate needed to suppress appetite but in a form that is acceptable and safe for humans,\" a researcher says.",

A June 2016 Hollywood Reporter article may have helped grease things: Hope Hicks emailed Wolff to say Trump was pleased with the cover. Post-election, Wolff says he floated the idea of him coming to the White House \"journalistically, as a fly on the wall\" to gather information for a future book. Trump seemed disinterested in the idea of a book, but \"his non-disapproval became a kind of passport for me to hang around,\" writes Wolff. And so Wolff writes he spent each week at the Hay-Adams hotel, scheduled appointments with senior staffers, and \"plunk[ed] myself down, day after day, on a West Wing couch.\" The excerpt shares other tidbits\u2014how the Secret Service protested the president's attempts to lock himself in his bedroom; how Trump's post-dinner calls to billionaire pals spurred leaks; how Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump thought Anthony Scaramucci would be the White House's saving grace\u2014which Trump's lawyer is now trying to block from release.

As the third-largest barrier reef in the world, the 360-mile stretch of vitally important sea life provides a buffet of nutrients for plants and animals along the state's Atlantic coast. Now, scientists are racing to find a cure, as detailed in a piece by NPR. To be sure, reefs are struggling worldwide, and coral diseases have been rising over the last decade, per NOAA, probably caused by pollution and rising ocean temperatures, which provide a warm home for pathogens. But growing swathes of coral from as far north as Pompano Beach in Broward County to as far south as Biscayne National Park are turning into watery graveyards, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection says in a report. Since 2015 the department has been working with a team of federal, state, and local groups to identify the likely pathogen, find a treatment, and address underlying problems\u2014but that identification hasn't yet happened. Scientist William Precht, who was hired by the state to monitor the health of reefs off the port of Miami, has watched the disease move from one patch of coral to another. He says that whatever is killing the coral is especially deadly for brain and star coral, which create the underlying structure for many reefs. The death of the coral, he tells NPR, is having a lasting impact. \"When you go out and swim on the reefs of Miami-Dade County today, it would be a very rare chance encounter that you'd see some of these three or four species.\" (There's bad news about the Great Barrier Reef, too.)",

What he came across this summer in the village of Huanchaquito, however, is \"not what we've seen before, especially on the coast,\" he says. Locals noticed bones poking out of a sandy ridge in 2011, and Peruvian archaeologist Gabriel Prieto went to investigate. He was greeted with a shock: the remains of 42 children and 76 llamas sacrificed some 600 years ago in a ritual by the Chim\u00fa, who controlled part of coastal Peru from around 1100 until they were overthrown by the Inca in 1470, Phys.org reports. Verano and Prieto's expansion of the dig this summer added to the \"exciting discovery\" as even more remains were found. \"It's not a place where you'd think to look,\" Tulane University's Verano says of the site, about 100 yards from a beach. He notes erosion and construction nearby helped reveal the forgotten remains. While Verano has come across the bodies of adults captured and killed in Peru, children are a rarity, he says. He explains the children may have been killed as a gift to the sea. (As Prieto explained to National Geographic in 2011, \"In the north coast of Peru, the ocean is very closely tied to agriculture because the temperature of the water can determine whether there will be rain or not.\") As for the llamas, the Chim\u00fa may have believed they would transport the children to the afterlife. The discovered bones and teeth are now being analyzed. (Other recent Peruvian discoveries include the world's highest Ice Age camp and ancient designs in the desert.)",

The suit, which the AP notes was filed on behalf of several groups, says the proposed 85% reduction at Bears Ears is an \"extreme overreach in authority\" and puts at risk dinosaur fossils and Native American artifacts, among other resources. Patagonia owner Yvon Chouinard told CNN of his litigious plans earlier this week, noting, \"This government is evil, and I'm not going to sit back and let evil win.\" President Obama designated Bears Ears a national monument at the end of 2016; Grand Staircase-Escalante received the protection 20 years earlier from President Clinton. At the heart of the commotion is whether a current president can walk back a former president's creation of a national monument under the Antiquities Act, with Native American tribes, environmental groups, and paleontologists arguing that Trump doesn't have the authority to do so; two legal experts interviewed by the AP had varying opinions on the matter. NBC News, which notes the legal wrangling over the national monuments could stretch out for years, adds that Patagonia has long been active in fighting for Utah's public lands. The AP notes more lawsuits are anticipated, especially if Trump moves on Zinke's push to cut other national monuments. More in Time from Patagonia's CEO on why the company is suing.",

Per CBS Los Angeles, DiMaggio, 47, was wired $750,000 in August 2016 to pay artists he agreed to recruit.

DiMaggio is also accused of paying off credit card debt and wiring $150,000 to his company, DiMagic Entertainment. The Peace for You Peace for Me Foundation demanded its money back when he suggested the concert scheduled for Oct. 1, 2016 be postponed, but DiMaggio said the artists had already been paid, reports Fox News.

During a 2004 custody case, Jennifer Bitterman said Michael Jace used an \"intimidation style of discipline\" on their young son, Jordan, according to court records obtained by the New York Daily News. Jace spanked him \"for crying or being afraid,\" and once threatened him for \"failing to stand up to his stepbrother,\" Bitterman said, adding that Jordan was afraid to be alone with his father and once called her \"inconsolably sobbing\" because Jace refused to take him home from an overnight visit. The court documents also reveal that, according to Bitterman, Jace threatened to kill her if she \"went to war\" over visitation with Jordan. And, the Los Angeles Times reports, another filing shows that one of Bitterman's friends testified that she saw at least four violent incidents between the couple before they divorced, including one in which Jace \"choked and hit\" Bitterman and then \"slammed her against the wall\"\u2014as Jordan, then 6 months old, cried in his crib nearby. Jordan is now grown, but Jace's two young sons with April Jace were home when he allegedly killed their mother. Money problems may have been behind their fight.",

Per KTVK, cops say Limpert did not take her daughter in for medical treatment when she realized what had happened.

Healthcare officials would reportedly later confirm the girl had THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, in her system. Police say Limpert admitted she made the mac and cheese for her husband, but that he did not know her daughter had ingested it.

Only the compromise bill would open a door to citizenship for young immigrants brought to the US illegally as children (\"Dreamers\"), and reduce the separation of children from their parents when families are detained crossing the border. When asked about the bills Friday in a Fox News interview, Trump said, \"I certainly wouldn't sign the more moderate one.\" But a senior White House official later said Trump had misspoken and believed his Fox interviewer was asking about an effort by GOP moderates\u2014abandoned for now\u2014that would have forced votes on a handful of bills and likely led to House passage of liberal-leaning versions party leaders oppose, per the AP. The White House later put out a statement formally endorsing the \"moderate\" measure now in the works. Earlier this week, Paul Ryan had said the president was on board with it. Trump also weighed in by tweet, writing that any bill \"MUST HAVE\" provisions financing his proposed wall with Mexico and curbing the existing legal immigration system. Those items are included in the middle-ground package. Democrats are expected to solidly oppose both GOP bills, giving Republicans little leeway for losing support.",

Biophysicist Daniel Perlman at Brandeis University, an inventor with more than 100 patents under his probably well-designed belt, says he's solved the age-old problem by etching a small groove into the bottle itself, per Phys.org. (You can see a demonstration via this video.) To arrive at his solution, Perlman studied slow-mo videos of wine being poured, then calculated precisely how large of an edge would be required to catch the offending drip. The answer: 2mm wide, 1mm deep.

A UN rep confirms that one of the team's vehicles was \"deliberately shot at multiple times\" by unidentified snipers in Damascus; all are safe. The shooting reportedly occurred in the buffer zone between rebel- and government-controlled territory, and the team will head back to the area once it replaces its vehicle, reports the AP. The Syrian government, for its part, has already blamed \"terrorists,\" reports CNN. More: Once they finally reach the site of last week's alleged attack, UN inspectors will spend two days taking soil, blood, urine, and tissue samples, reports the BBC. But Reuters reports that the US and its allies aren't expecting much: They believe the regime's offer to allow inspectors to the site came too late and any remaining evidence has probably been destroyed by heavy shelling. To wit, a senior White House official dismissed the visit as \"too late to be credible.\" Assad, meanwhile, says that any American attempt at military intervention will be doomed to fail. \"Failure awaits the United States as in all previous wars it has unleashed, starting with Vietnam and up to the present day,\" he said in an interview with a Russian newspaper. UN chief Ban Ki-moon warns that \"every hour counts\" in determining the facts of what was a \"major and terrible incident,\" reports the Guardian. \"We cannot allow impunity in what appears to be a grave crime against humanity,\" he said. But the UN Security Council, which is split on the issue, has already failed to shoulder its responsibilities and the UK and its allies may have to take action without its approval, Britain's foreign minister says. \"Is it possible to respond to chemical weapons without complete unity on the UN Security Council?\" William Hague tells the BBC. \"I would argue yes it is, otherwise it might be impossible to respond to such outrages.\"",

But her ex-husband, who divorced her in 2016, provided a recording of her detailing a sexual encounter with Greitens and saying Greitens told her the photos would be released if she exposed the affair. She did not know she was being recorded.

According to the Christian Science Monitor, private prisons are a $5 billion a year industry with 19% of federal prisoners currently being held in one, and banning them could face an uphill battle in Congress.

CNN has a profile on Maharaj's case detailing how, in 1986, he was arrested for the Miami murders of his business partners Derrick and Duane Moo Young\u2014even though he had an alibi. Police said the Moo Youngs had cheated the former millionaire out of $400,000. He was found guilty and sentenced to death. That sentence has since been reduced to life in prison, but in April a Florida judge scheduled a November hearing to determine if new evidence could undermine the verdict. Maharaj's lawyers have 53 witnesses and 498 documents on tap, according to the Guardian. \"We've got several Colombian cartel people to say, 'We did the murders,'\" one lawyer says. These cartel witnesses say that the Moo Youngs were money launderers for the cartel, and were killed because they lost some of the money. The lawyers also say they can prove that prosecutors hid evidence that would have proved Maharaj's innocence.

But in a statement to the Today show, Knox was clearer: \"(If convicted), legally I'll be defined a 'fugitive,' but I will continue to fight for my innocence,\" she said. \"I will not willingly submit myself to injustice.\" Such a verdict would need to be upheld by the country's top court, and even then it's not clear whether Italy would ask the US to extradite her, or how the US would respond (double jeopardy could be at play, but it's complicated). Still, such a comment may not serve her well, the Daily Beast points out: US officials may now have to keep her on their radar in case she is found guilty. The verdict is due Jan. 30.",

The FDNY says the explosion happened around 11am at 68th Street and Fifth Avenue, per NBC New York, and a senior law enforcement official tells the station a bag of fireworks was found near the scene, though it's not clear it was a firework that caused the explosion. The Post IDs the 18-year-old who was injured as Conner Golden, who was climbing on rocks in the park with some other pals, all said to be visiting from the DC area. Golden was whisked to Bellevue Hospital and is currently undergoing surgery, with sources saying an amputation looks likely. 1010 Wins reports Golden is in critical but stable condition, via CBS New York. According to John Murphy, another visitor to the park who came upon the scene, it looked like Golden's foot was missing below the ankle. \"His left leg was severely damaged, all bone and muscle,\" he says. \"He was in shock. I don't think he even realized what had happened.\" Cops are trying to determine if the explosion, which witnesses tell the Post could be heard from outside where Elie Wiesel's funeral was being held, was caused by a firework or what the Post calls a \"more sinister\" device, and if the DC buddies were the ones who may have brought fireworks into the park. \"I said, 'Come on, guys, were you carrying fireworks?'\" Murphy says. \"And they said no. And I believed them. \u2026 This wasn't an M80 or a cherry bomb. [This was] something much more serious.\" NBC notes that section of the park was cordoned off, but the park wasn't evacuated or closed due to the incident.",

In other words, the silt buried under thousands of feet of ice \"has been preserved from beyond the dawn of humankind,\" says Paul Bierman, who determined the soil's age through a geochemical dating process. The findings also suggest Greenland wasn't always as frosty as it is today: Instead, it was a tundra for between 200,000 and one million years before it was encased in ice. It was once home to bits of forest, the scientists found using offshore plant DNA. In other words, as the International Business Times has it, \"Greenland really was green.\" The Greenland Ice Sheet that's there now, however, has been remarkably durable: The findings imply that it made it through a strong period of warming some 130,000 years ago. \"It's unlikely the ice sheet has disappeared for significant periods of time in the last three million years, at least at this one pinprick on this big island,\" Bierman says. \"Now human activity may spell the end of it.\" (What else lies under Greenland's ice? A canyon that dwarfs the Grand Canyon, an aquifer holding 100 billion tons of water, and two huge lakes.)",

Based on a Tuesday evening tweet from ESPN's Howard Bryant, Sports Illustrated reports that, starting with the 2017 season, MLB pitchers will no longer have to waste time lobbing four pitches at batters they plan to intentionally walk. Instead, teams can now simply signal the ump that a walk is in the works, and the runner can immediately saunter over to first. This change could shave 14.3 seconds off of each game, per estimates by the Wall Street Journal. The Washington Post notes \"not everyone is thrilled\" with the change, including those who enjoy watching what happens when intentional-walk pitches go wild or batters go for them anyway. Others wonder if the time savings is worth the effort, with one commenter noting: \"Is the automatic IBB really gonna fix pace of play?\" (Start reading about baseball's \"most interesting pitcher\" with all that time you just gained.)",

What the buzz is on this \"eagerly awaited\" IPO: Recode offers a quick-hit Q&A, including such queries as: \"What could possibly go wrong with Snap going public?\" Kids, teens, and young adults are the ones who use Snapchat the most, but it's the older generations who are more likely to be investors. The elder set's confusion over the vanishing messages could be a problem, per MarketWatch. All eyes would be on Snap CEO Evan Spiegel right now\u2014if anyone could find him. The Wall Street Journal takes a closer look at the company's \"elusive\" (and apparently reticent) founder. \"Evan doesn't talk much,\" shrugs an early investor. The company's plans for the future are an important piece of the IPO puzzle. Sources tell the New York Times those plans may involve a drone. Despite Snapchat's sluggish user growth and the company's hefty hosting costs, Mad Money's Jim Cramer believes the trade will be a \"phenomenal\" one. \"I think the good absolutely outweighs the bad here,\" he says, per CNBC.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A decades-old murder mystery has finally come to some sort of an end. Following a judge's Wednesday ruling, a death certificate has been issued for Lord Lucan, who the New York Times recounts as \"a dashing British aristocrat\" last seen on Nov. 7, 1974\u2014the day that his children's nanny was found dead, allegedly by his hand. The BBC recalls the crime: Sandra Rivett was beaten to death in the family's London home and her body left in the basement; Lord Lucan's estranged wife was also attacked but got away, fleeing to a neighboring pub and yelling \"He\u2019s in the house! He\u2019s murdered the nanny!\" per the Times. Lady Lucan named her then 39-year-old husband as the attacker, saying he had thought she was Rivett, reports USA Today. A June 1975 inquest named him as Rivett's murderer, except the man born Richard John Bingham was never officially seen again after that night; a car he had borrowed from a friend was later found, blood-stained and abandoned. The sightings and theories kept flowing, though: in Melbourne, Australia, and France within the first year; employed as a waiter in San Francisco; backpacking on Mount Etna; dying in Goa in 1996. Just last Saturday came a story from an old gambling friend, who says he was told that the lord shot himself and had his body fed to a tiger. Lucan was declared dead in 1996, but the rub was that son George Bingham was unable to take on his title, preventing him from assuming his father's seat in the House of Lords. The death certificate now allows for that.",
