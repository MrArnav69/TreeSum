She already faced charges of battery and obstructing an officer as a result, and now TMZ reports that a paramedic on the scene will file suit this week. The EMT says the 57-year-old actress deliberately kicked her as the actress was being placed on a gurney, causing head and neck injuries that forced the paramedic onto desk duties. On a better note, Locklear posted an Instagram video from rehab last month, showing photos of her with her now 21-year-old daughter. Locklear checked into the facility in July and is undergoing long-term treatment, per People.",

The delay, which reduces America's bargaining power at next month's Copenhagen conference, reflects weakening support for the controversial \"cap-and-trade\" bill as unemployment remains high, the Wall Street Journal notes. The bill strategy calls for capping overall greenhouse-gas emissions, but would allow companies to buy and trade permits allowing certain amounts of emissions. President Obama is working with Senate leaders to get the bill through as quickly as possible, said a White House spokesman. The delay, however, has raised fears that the Senate may end up putting off debating the bill for as long as 2011 to avoid holding a vote just before next year's midterm elections. \"There would be nothing better than for us to talk about over the summer than Democrats pushing a huge new energy tax,\u201d one Republican leadership aide told The Hill.",

Once Exelby realized she was back on the air, she let out a startled gasp, but quickly composed herself and continued with the broadcast. News outlets reported Exelby, a freelance journalist, was yanked from on-air segments for ABC, with some even framing it as a firing. But ABC's news director insists that's not true and that \"slip-ups will happen.\" \"Our presenters are humans, not robots,\" he says, adding Exelby is simply an occasional contributor (not a full-time employee) who only does on-air segments as needed, even though at the moment she hasn't been rescheduled to do more on-air bits, per the Guardian (which cites sources saying Exelby had been \"read the riot act\" by management). The Australian notes she's been hired to temporarily read the morning news for a Sydney radio station while the regular host is on break. Exelby, who had supporters such as Russell Crowe rushing to her defense, thanked everyone on Twitter, adding, \"Not my finest hour.

Faith was important to Rogan, and the former Marine could typically be found at St. Mary's Oratory in Wausau, which he had attended for at least 15 years, about three times a week, the reverend says. Friends have stepped forward to help with Rogan's organic seed and fertilizer business, and a GoFundMe campaign has so far raised more than $270,000 for the family he left behind. Niki is a stay-at-home mom and homeschools the kids\u2014who, besides the newborn, range in age from 2 to 15\u2014and the money raised will be used to allow her to continue to do that as well as cover the costs of a new van, medical expenses, and the funeral this weekend.",

While she was on hall patrol duty for five minutes in between classes, the engineering and computer programming teacher at Union County Career and Technical Center says a 16-year-old student grabbed her phone and found a nude photo she had taken for her husband for Valentine's Day, per NBC News and WSPA. \"He took pictures from his cell phone of that and then he told the whole class that he would send them to whoever wanted them,\" Arthur tells WSPA. After class, the student told her, \"Your day of reckoning is coming,\" Arthur says. It was only later she found out the photo had been seen. The student indeed shared the photo through texts and on social media, superintendent David Eubanks tells WYFF, adding Arthur was given the choice to resign or go through a process for dismissal. She resigned last Tuesday. \"I think we have a right to privacy, but when we take inappropriate information or pictures, we had best make sure it remains private,\" Eubanks tells the State. Arthur says the student hasn't been punished. She plans to press charges and has also complained to the Union Public Safety Department, which is investigating. \"The whole premise of my privacy being invaded is being ignored and that's what's wrong,\" she says. Some 1,000 people have signed a petition to have her job restored, though Arthur says she's not sure if she'd take it.

In fact, a new study finds that heavy cardio sports like cycling and rowing do nothing to help you live longer than playing golf or cricket, reports the Wall Street Journal. Researchers looked at mortality rates in 9,889 Olympic athletes who completed from 1896 to 1936 in 43 types of sports, and surprisingly found that those who competed in intense activities did not live any longer than those who curled, shot guns, played cricket, or golfed. \"Engaging in cycling and rowing (high cardiovascular intensity) had no added survival benefit compared with playing golf or cricket (low cardiovascular intensity),\" says the study. One theory is that intensive exercise over the long-term also leads to injuries and damage that balance out the benefits of such exercise. \"Over time, this will result in an accumulation of damage, which can be explained as a form of aging,\" says a study author.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Always hoped you're mom's favorite? A new study out of Purdue University finds that the favorite child is actually more prone to be depressed as an adult, researchers report in the Journal of Gerontology: Social Sciences. Looking at 725 adult children from 309 families in the Within-Family Differences Study\u2014a longitudinal project documenting various aspects of relationships between parents and their adult children\u2014they say that depressive symptoms were most common in the adult children who claimed to be emotionally closer to their mother than their siblings, reports Medical News Today. That also held true for \"the children with whom their mothers had the greatest conflict, and in whom the mothers were most disappointed,\" write the authors. Interestingly, the study found no difference between male and female children, but it did find a racial disparity, notes Medical Daily. Adult black children felt their mother's disappointment more acutely than their white counterparts. Researchers hypothesize that sibling rivalry may be behind the depression, meaning more attention or support from mom doesn't necessarily beat out the negative attention from jealous siblings. Or that the favorites are more often asked to help the aging mother, which is its own source of stress. (The adult children in the study had mothers who were 65 to 75 when interviewed.) And yet a third possibility is posed by Bustle: A mother's attention may naturally drift toward the weakest or most sensitive child, thus her favoritism doesn't necessarily cause depression. Researchers plan to look at whether similar results play out with fathers, and whether it's possible to predict favoritism. (One study finds that young kids in religious households are less willing to share stickers.)",

A small new study out of the NYU Langone Medical Center finds that at least among 20 long-term Alcoholics Anonymous members who reported no cravings in the week leading up to the test, prayer reduced cravings that arose when shown images of alcoholic drinks or people drinking. To perform the tests, the researchers report in the American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse, participants were asked to read the newspaper or pray after being shown the images. Participants reported some craving following seeing the images, but less so after having prayed, while MRI data showed changes in parts of the prefrontal cortex that controls attention as well as in regions thought to control emotion. \"This finding suggests that there appears to be an emotional response to alcohol triggers, but that it\u2019s experienced and understood differently when someone has the protection of the AA experience,\" says senior author Marc Galanter, who published a book on Alcoholics Anonymous earlier this year. He goes on to suggest that the reduction in cravings in AA members correlates to the amount of time that has elapsed since one's so-called \"spiritual awakening,\" which AA describes as taking a different attitude toward drinking. In previous research, participants asked to pray every day for four weeks drank about half as much as those who were not. (See why some have been challenging the 75-year hegemony of AA.)",

That amount translates to about 105 bottles of wine per resident per year, the Independent notes. And no, this doesn't hinge around all that communion wine.

Steven Beare, attempting his first solo climb without a guide, was due at a checkpoint June 16 but never arrived. \"We know that there was a really bad storm that came in really quick out of nowhere,\" his wife Olivia Beare tells ABC 7. \"We're thinking that's when he got lost.\" According to Russian media, an eight-person rescue team tried to follow Beare's route on Mount Elbrus but gave up the search Sunday. Olivia Beare is currently paying a private rescue team $2,500 an hour to continue looking for her husband. The Colorado Police Officers Foundation is collecting donations. Beare, an Army veteran with a young child and another on the way, has been climbing for five years, KDVR reports. His goal was to summit the world's seven highest peaks; he had already climbed Mount Kilimanjaro. Olivia Beare, who hasn't spoken to her husband since he arrived in Russia on June 12, says he has the skills to survive a blizzard but may be injured. \"I'm really scared,\" she tells ABC 7. She adds to KDVR: \"I can\u2019t raise two babies by myself.\" Littleton Police Chief Doug Stephens says cops \"fight through and win\" when things seem hopeless, and he's sure Beare is doing just that.",

The move came after the company was attacked for granting verified status to Jason Kessler, who put together the white nationalist rally that rocked Charlottesville in August (and issued this \"vile\" tweet about victim Heather Heyer). In a series of tweets, Twitter explained that \"verification was meant to authenticate identity & voice ... [but] verification has long been perceived as an endorsement. We gave verified accounts visual prominence on the service which deepened this perception. We should have addressed this earlier but did not prioritize the work as we should have.\" General verification requests had been put on ice as of Nov. 9 pending a review of the program, and the Guardian reports that Twitter's new policy specifies that accounts that promote hate, support hate groups, or harass users will see verification revoked. Among those to immediately lose the check, per the Washington Post, were Kessler, white nationalist Richard Spencer, and far-right activist Laura Loomer (known for rushing the stage during Julius Caesar and being banned from Uber and Lyft after anti-Muslim tweets).

It appears to be \"excellent\" and \"well-performed,\" he writes, but it was an observational study, and as such has limitations\u2014for example, it's possible that there were already genetic differences between subjects who adhered to the diet and those who didn't.",

Here is what is known: The victims: Sixty-five passengers and six crew members were aboard the plane, and the BBC reports that most of the passengers were from the Russian region of Orenburg in the Ural mountains. The cause: Way too early to tell. Investigators are looking into weather conditions (it was about 23 degrees Fahrenheit), human error, and the technical condition of the Antonov An-148 airliner, reports Reuters. But Russia's Investigative Committee wasn't ruling anything out at this point, reports the AP. After takeoff: The plane went down shortly after takeoff from Domodedovo Airport en route to Orsk, about 1,000 miles southeast of Moscow. Fragments of the plane were scattered about a large, remote region near the village of Argunovo. Engine explosion? The Guardian cites unconfirmed reports in Russian media that the captain had requested permission for an emergency landing at a nearby airport after reporting a technical malfunction. Witnesses reported seeing the plane in flames as it fell, leading to speculation that an engine had exploded before the crash. End of streak: This is the first crash of a commercial airliner in more than a year, following a sterling aviation record in 2017, notes the BBC. Putin: He offered his condolences to the families of victims and delayed a trip to the Black Sea resort of Sochi, where he planned to meet Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas on Monday.",

A Harvard University junior lost his Facebook internship two hours before he had planned to travel to it after he exploited a privacy issue in the social network's Messenger system. Aran Khanna discussed his experience and findings in a paper published in Harvard's Technology Science journal. \"From 2011 to the start of this study in May 2015, Facebook Messenger collected and shared user geo-locations as the default setting for every message sent from the Android mobile app,\" he writes. The flaw was that those locations could be seen by anyone in a group chat, even if the person who sent the message wasn't friends with everyone else in the group. And so Khanna developed a browser app called Marauder's Map that exposed, on a map, the geo-location data that was being shared. He tweeted about his Chrome extension and posted about it on Medium on May 26. By the 28th, CNN, the Washington Post, and many others had covered his findings; the extension was downloaded 85,000 times. That same day, Facebook asked Khanna to disable the app; he did. The company also deactivated location sharing on desktops and released a June 4 update that required users to opt in to location sharing. It also withdrew Khanna's internship, which was to start on June 1. The official reason given was a violation of the \"high ethical standards expected of interns,\" according to Boston.com. \"This mapping tool scraped Facebook data in a way that violated our terms,\" a Facebook rep tells the site. Khanna says his app was created using his own Messenger history, not data scraping. \"I didn't write the program to be malicious,\" he says. Khanna ended up securing an internship with another Silicon Valley firm. (This alleged intern tale of woe involves the Olsen twins.)",

Bras, who took over the restaurant from his father, Michel, more than a decade ago, tells AFP he can no longer take reviewers showing up unannounced at any time, usually a few times a year. \"I want to feel free without asking myself whether my creations will please the Michelin inspectors,\" he says.

He notes he didn't tell Bowers he was Jewish, instead choosing to \"show him empathy.\" And also \"love.\" \"I could care less what Robert Bowers thinks, but you, the person reading this, love is the only message I wish [to] instill in you,\" he writes. Mahler, who initially worried his own parents could've been among the synagogue victims, says what happened didn't shock him and that \"it\u2019s only a matter of time before the next one happens,\" adding although \"my heart yearns for change \u2026 today's climate doesn't foster nurturing, tolerance, or civility.\" He also notes he didn't see \"evil\" when he looked into Bowers' eyes, but \"something else.\" Hospital President Jeff Cohen, who said Mahler came to him in tears after treating Bowers, concurs. \"He's a very lost guy,\" Cohen says of Bowers, per TribLIVE, but \"he's not the face of the devil. He's just a guy who committed a very heinous act.\" Read Mahler's post here. (Also working off of love: Muslims raising money for victims of the shooting.)",

But Foye has bigger fish to fry than working moms getting to leave work on time. She's advocating for \"meternity leave\" to balance out the maternity leave given to new moms. She defines meternity leave as \"a sabbatical-like break that allows women and, to a lesser degree, men to shift their focus to the part of their lives that doesn\u2019t revolve around their jobs.\" Foye says a meternity leave would allow childless women to get the time to refocus and reevaluate their lives\u2014time that is already afforded to new mothers. Foye actually took a meternity leave for herself and says the experience was invaluable. \"I may not have been changing diapers, but I grappled with self-doubt for the year and a half that I spent away from the corporate world,\" she writes. Obviously, Foye's opinion has been controversial. \"I have to laugh pretty hard at a Foye\u2019s description of maternity leave as a 'sabbatical-like break,'\" writes Mary Elizabeth Williams at Salon. \"It\u2019s not exactly a vacation,\" concurs Korin Miller at Women's Health Magazine. \"You're up every three hours to nurse. ... If you can squeeze in a five-minute shower, it's pretty much a damn miracle.\" And Laura June at New York Magazine points out only 13% of new moms in the US even get maternity leave.",

As for a solution, some areas suggest a distance boats must keep from the creatures, but the standards aren't usually officially required. \u201cWhale-watching is traditionally seen as green tourism,\u201d says a US wildlife biologist. \u201cThe negative is the potential for disturbance.

Shortly before, he purchased a child's nightgown, bikini, girls' underwear, lipstick, and nail polish at an area Walmart. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has pictures of those items. Carlie's mother Shannon Trent tells People she felt \"sick to my stomach\" when she heard about those purchases. \"I don't know what he's done to her,\" she says. \"I don't think he would hurt her, but if he's capable of kidnapping a child he's capable of anything.\" Authorities believe Carlie is in \"imminent danger.\" Simpson also purchased camping supplies and nonperishable groceries, and authorities think he may be hiding with Carlie in an isolated area. The TBI says there have been rumors online that Simpson is trying to protect Carlie, but it says that couldn't be further from the truth. \"This was not an innocent camping trip, this was a crime,\" a spokesperson tells WATE. Simpson, Carlie's uncle by marriage, and his wife once had custody of Carlie, but her father James Trent had custody at the time of her abduction. Shannon Trent, who hasn't had custody of Carlie in two years, says she \"always had a bad feeling\" about Simpson. \"I should have stuck with my gut,\" she tells People.

Per Courthouse News, Tawfeeq was returning to the US from Baghdad (he travels to the Middle East often for work) on Jan. 29 when a US Customs and Border Protection officer pulled him aside. Tawfeeq's green card and passport were examined, he was interrogated about his trip, and he was told he'd need to wait for \"an email\" from the proper authorities to clear him to enter the country. When he was finally allowed to leave, no one offered further explanation, and they didn't even stamp his passport or give him any entry papers. \"The executive order has greatly increased the uncertainty involved in current and future international travel\" for legal resident such as Tawfeeq, the suit claims, per the Hill. It also adds that, as a legal permanent resident, he should be afforded \"greater procedural protections than non-immigrants/temporary aliens.\" A CNN rep says the network supports Tawfeeq and that his complaint \"is a basic request to clarify and assert his rights under the law,\" per the Hill.",

Despite those efforts, hearing officer Oliver Morris ruled last week against the brewers, saying, \"On the basis that Elvis is a relatively uncommon name, and given that Mr. Presley is the most famous of Elvises, I consider that most average consumers, on seeing the name Elvis alone, are likely to conceptualize that on the basis of Elvis Presley.\" In addition to losing the name of one of its most popular products, BrewDog must also pay the Presley estate $1,934 in court costs.

The push began earlier this year when the Bank of England announced that Winston Churchill would replace prison reformer Elizabeth Fry on the 5-pound note. Critics pointed out that would leave no women on the nation's currency, except for the queen. And as the LA Times notes, this week's birth of a certain royal baby means that Britain will be ruled by kings for decades after the 87-year-old queen dies. Austen's presence means at least one woman will remain on the money.",

According to one source, UN officials knew the report was \"potentially damaging,\" as it suggested WFP food aid cuts to the Rohingya over a two-year period were causing harm, even starvation. \"There was a real sense that they had things to hide,\" the source says. The WFP tells a very different story: The agency \"stands by its original assessment\" that 80,000 Rohingya children under the age of five were suffering from potentially fatal weight loss in Rakhine in July. However, the food situation will have changed since an \"upsurge in violence\" in August, \"just months before the next harvest,\" a rep tells the Telegraph. \"In a dynamic and evolving situation, it is important to coordinate closely with all partners, including the government,\" WFP adds, noting its decision to scrap the previous report came \"following a request by the government to conduct a joint review.\" That review has stalled with Myanmar keeping agencies out of the conflict zone, however.

Under a plea deal, the 41-year-old will spend between three and eight years in prison. Prosecutors say Sandusky pressured a teenage girl under 16 to send him nude photos, the New York Times reports. After her father reported messages from Sandusky to police last year, investigators discovered that he had asked the girl's sister to perform oral sex on him in 2013, when she was 13. He pleaded guilty to charges including soliciting sex from a child younger than 16. Authorities say Sandusky, a former state prison guard who knew the girls through dating their mother, tried to persuade them that what he was doing was normal, saying \"it's not weird because he studied medicine,\" but asking them not to show his messages to anybody. Sandusky, like his mother, Dottie, loyally supported his father through his trial for the sexual abuse of 10 boys, the Times notes. Sandusky will now be classed as a Tier III sex offender, Pennsylvania's highest level, meaning he will have to register with state police for life and verify his information four times a year.

His symptoms soon worsened, however, and his wife, Dawn, rushed him to the ER, where they noticed his body was covered in bruises, \"like somebody beat him up with a baseball bat,\" she says. Blood tests soon revealed the cause: Manteufel had gone into septic shock from the Capnocytophaga canimorsus bacteria, which Live Science notes is found in the mouths of nearly three-quarters of dogs and 57% of cats, though the animals themselves don't get sick from it. In humans, however, the bacteria can cause a blood infection, or sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and even death. Doctors had to amputate Manteufel's legs at the knees; he also lost his hands, and his nose has to be reconstructed. \"He told the doctors, 'Do what you have to do to keep me alive,'\" Dawn Manteufel tells the Washington Post. She adds they don't know which dog infected her husband: They counted eight dogs he'd been around at the time he fell sick, including his own. The Manteufels will have to sell their house and look for a one-story home now, and Greg Manteufel will no longer be able to work as a house painter or cruise on his Harley. Still, Dawn Manteufel says, \"There's no negativity from him so far.\" A Froedtert & the Medical College of Wisconsin doctor tells FOX6 what happened to Manteufel was a fluke and that \"more than 99% of the people [who] have dogs will never have this issue.\" The GoFundMe for Manteufel has raised more than $28,000.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 When William McCormack went into a medical center in the Adirondacks last month with severe stomach pains, he ended up getting an emergency appendectomy ... which came as quite a surprise to him, considering he thought he'd already had his appendix removed in Bronxville, New York, last year. The 43-year-old is now suing Lawrence Hospital and Dr. Michael Kerin, the surgeon who claimed to have removed McCormack's appendix in January 2013, the Journal News reports. McCormack was on vacation near Lake Placid in early March when he had to undergo emergency surgery, during which surgeons \"discovered that (McCormack's) appendix was never removed and was still inside him,\" according to his lawsuit. Also included in the suit: a copy of the post-op report from Lawrence Hospital, which is signed by Kerin and claims McCormack's appendix had indeed been removed. It's not clear how exactly the hospital failed to alert McCormack he was still in possession of the body part, as a report from the pathology department states, \"there is no evidence of appendix\" in the specimen marked \"appendix.\" So what was removed from McCormack's body? A \"yellowish mass,\" according to News 12.",

According to Breaking Belize News, the bodies were found Monday evening in Corozal District, near the border with Mexico. \"They were both found ... they are dead,\" says Nancy Rifenbark, a friend who joined a search party, per Global News. Matus' vehicle was found abandoned in a sugarcane field on Sunday around 15 miles from where they were last seen leaving a bar last Tuesday night. It isn't clear how the couple died, though foul play is widely suspected. Matus, 52, who spent winters in the Central American country, was supposed to fly back to Canada last Wednesday, the CBC reports. DeVoursney, a 36-year-old former Marine who had been with Matus for a few months, was scheduled to return to Georgia this week. \"Drew is no longer with us. Someone had killed a United States Marine, my brother in arms, who survived Fallujah, Iraq, and Afghanistan,\" said friend Brandon Barfield, per the New York Daily News.

The Cleveland Courage Fund, a tax-free trust set up in their name, has been flooded with donations and now totals $825,000. The victims have begun dipping into the money, which will be split evenly among Gina DeJesus, Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry, and Berry's six-year-old daughter. \"The outpouring of public support has been nothing short of remarkable,\" the victims previously said in a letter via ABC News. \"The community is acting in a way you would hope they would act,\" the fund's co-trustee told Reuters, adding the money will help the women with whatever they need. \"Ten years out of society means not finishing school, no job training, and not learning how to drive.\" It's not only money that's being offered up. Doctors and dentists have volunteered their services, while others have donated the use of vacation homes and cars. Meanwhile, Reuters reports neighborhood residents have talked about tearing down Ariel Castro's now boarded-up house and planting four oak trees in its place.",

The report says the combination of sedatives and anesthesia Finley received during the procedure probably caused her death, the AP reports. The report noted that Finley was healthy, and ruled out any signs of an underlying heart condition or an allergic reaction. The medical examiner's office ruled the toddler's death an accident, and no charges have been brought against Dr. Lilly Geyer, KHON reports; however, Finley's family has filed a lawsuit claiming Finley was not monitored for 26 minutes while she was under sedation. Geyer's office has since shut down, but Geyer's attorney calls the Boyle family's allegations \"unproven.\" (Meanwhile, a young mother in Hawaii is in a coma following wisdom teeth surgery.)",
