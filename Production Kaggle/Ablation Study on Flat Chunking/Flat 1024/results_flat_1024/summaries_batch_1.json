Here's what people are saying: \"If you're comfortable with the Supreme Court resolving disputes over technology, the transcript of Tuesday's oral arguments in ABC vs. Aero should change your mind,\" writes Lyle Denniston at SCOTUSblog. The court \"struggled to get past a simplistic view of the technology involved,\" he writes. \"That's physically impossible, not just because antennas aren't sensitive enough to detect signals from outside the local market but because the world isn't, you know, flat. And that sounds so much like what a TV system does or what a satellite system does, that it looks as if somehow you are escaping a constraint that's imposed upon them.\" \"Everyone outside the court should be disturbed by a question like that,\" writes Eugene Robinson at the Washington Post. \"At stake here is the degree to which innovative companies are going to have to seek permission from copyright owners to enable people to do in the cloud what they can do for themselves at home.\" \"Most of the energy, at least from the bench, was about the risk that the Court might rule in this case in a way that would smother the infant of digital innovation in its electronic crib,\" writes Denniston. \"She confessed her concern, saying 'this is really hard for me.'\"",

Aereo, a much-watched case that could have big implications for both cloud computing and broadcast television\u2014implications the justices didn't seem comfortable with.

The major broadcast networks are suing it for copyright violation, and stand to lose billions in fees cable companies pay to carry their programming. Aereo says it's simply renting users the equipment to do online what they can legally do at home. Here's how the arguments went: \"If you're comfortable with the Supreme Court resolving disputes over technology, the transcript of Tuesday's oral arguments \u2026 should change your mind,\" writes Jon Healey at the LA Times. Stephen Breyer at one point made an analogy to \"what used to be called a phonograph record store.\" He also worried that Aereo's antennas could \"pick up every television signal in the world,\" which isn't true, Healey pointed out, \"because the world isn't, you know, flat.\" The justices seemed skeptical of Aereo's business model. \"It's not logical to me that you can make these millions of copies and essentially sell them to the public,\" Sonia Sotomayor said. John Roberts said the company was only using thousands of small antennas, instead of a few big ones \"to get around copyright laws,\" the Wall Street Journal reports. But the justices also seemed genuinely worried that their decision could stifle innovation. Sotomayor asked what effect this would have on \"the Dropbox and the iCloud.\" When the broadcasters' lawyers told them to \"just be confident\" that Aereo's service was different, Samuel Alito said, \"I don't find that very satisfying. \u2026 I need to understand what effect it will have on these other technologies.\" Aereo's best hope is that the justices adhere to a lower court's Cartoon Network vs. Cablevision ruling, which held that customers could make DVR recordings on Cablevision's hard drives, writes Lyle Denniston at SCOTUSblog. At one point, Anthony Kennedy suggested lawyers pretend that decision had come from the high court. Ultimately, the justices didn't seem to like their options. \"This is really hard for me,\" Sotomayor confessed. \"I don't see how to get out of it,\" Breyer agreed.",

The turboprop plane crashed into the mountain around 30 minutes into a 42-minute flight without making a distress call, CNN reports. The cause of the crash hasn't been determined, though officials believe the rugged terrain may have played a role. \"There's a possibility the aircraft hit a peak and then fell into a ravine because the place that it was found is steep,\" a search and rescue official tells Reuters, which notes that Trigana has a very patchy safety record, with 14 serious incidents since it started flying in 1991, including 10 in which the aircraft was destroyed. The plane was also carrying $468,750 in cash, which was to be distributed to poor families.",

But when the FDA gave the green light in 2006 for the drug to be used as a schizophrenic aid for kids, new labels said the drug contained high levels of the hormone prolactin, which spurs breast growth, Kline adds. Pledger had started growing breasts by then\u2014and now, the only way he can get rid of them is through a mastectomy, Kline says. A Janssen spokeswoman sent a statement to People noting the company is \"disappointed\" in the decision and that the drug's side effects were clearly spelled out for Pledger's family and prescribing physician. The spokeswoman also argued that Pledger's \"quality of life was significantly improved during the time he was taking Risperdal,\" per the Daily News.

Police say Debra Lynn Harrell, 46, dropped the girl off at the park around 9:30am, then dropped her off at work around 2pm, WFXG reports. When a woman asked where her mother was, the girl told her mother drops her off all the time so she can play while her mother is at work. The girl also said she sometimes walks over to the McDonald's inside Walmart to buy lunch, according to the police report. Harrell confessed to leaving the girl alone at the parks and was arrested and booked into jail on charges of unlawful neglect toward a child. The Department of Social Services took custody of the girl, and she is now in the custody of her paternal grandmother, the Aiken Standard reports. The state's decision is \"coming at a time when it is suffering from a shortage of foster families, as well as a child protective services workforce so overwhelmed that serious child abuse inquiries are regularly closed in violation of policy,\" writes Elspeth Reeve at Slate. \"By arresting this mom (presumably causing her to lose her job) and putting the child in foster care, the state has caused the child far more trauma than she was.\"",

The 46-year-old South Carolina mom repeatedly sent her 9-year-old daughter to a well-trafficked park while she went to work at McDonald's. When the parents of other children at the park found out, they called police, who arrested Harrell and charged her with unlawful conduct toward a child. The daughter has been placed in state custody. Local news outlets first reported the story on July 1, but it's been getting wider attention lately thanks to an indignant post on Reason from \"Free Range Kids\" advocate Lenore Skenazy. And so far, pretty much everyone agrees that the arrest is senseless and wrong. Some reactions: Skenazy notes that the original news reports make it sound like Harrell \"committed a serious, unconscionable crime,\" as locals speculate that the girl could have been kidnapped. \"To which I must ask: In broad daylight? In a crowded park? Just because something happened on Law & Order doesn't mean it's happening all the time in real life.\" \"Since I'm a parent, Harrell\u2019s arrest scares me: How can I appropriately parent my child when doing something that seems relatively safe, if out of fashion, can get you arrested?\" asks Jessica Grose at Slate. One law professor tells Grose that the statutes for child welfare laws are often broadly written, giving police lots of latitude\u2014and allowing \"race, class, and gender biases to influence decisions.\" That could be the case here, because Harrell is black, and her poverty helped cause the situation. \"The story is a convergence of helicopter parenting with America\u2019s primitive family policy,\" writes Jonathan Chait at New York. \"Our welfare policy is designed to make everybody, even single mothers, work full-time jobs. The social safety net makes it difficult for low-wage single mothers to obtain adequate child care. And society is seized by bizarre fears that children are routinely snatched up by strangers in public places,\" which is actually an exceedingly rare phenomenon. \"The state has caused the child far more trauma than she was ever likely to suffer in the park,\" writes Conor Friedersdorf at the Atlantic, and they're taking the child at a time when the state has a shortage of foster families. And there's no empirical evidence saying the child would be safer, say, sitting at McDonald's. \"The actual safety of a given kid is not being rigorously determined.

A former FBI agent tells CBS News Tannerite appears to be \"on the defensive.\" \"It\u2019s just something we have to be aware of that these terrorists are very clever at finding out what components can come together and make an improvised exploding device,\" he says.

Police believe Palma targeted Hatfield for sexual assault, and evidence shows his blood was on her partially ripped underwear and window sill, Fox 25 reports. Palma, who was released from prison in 1986 after being convicted of assault and/or battery with a dangerous weapon, was taken into custody after an officer went through previously collected evidence and submitted it for DNA testing. \"It's proverbial needle in a haystack\u2014how fortunate, lucky we were in this case,'\" the police chief says.",

Kirsten Hatfield disappeared from her bedroom in Midwest City on the night of May 14, 1997, and Anthony Palma, who lived two houses away, was arrested this week on charges of kidnapping and first-degree murder, KOCO reports. The breakthrough in the cold case came after a new investigator took over in June and discovered that key pieces of evidence\u2014including bloodstains on the girl's bedroom window sill and on her underwear, found in her backyard\u2014were never tested for DNA, reports NBC News. Palma, who was released from prison in 1986 after serving time for assault with a dangerous weapon, still lives in the same home, and an arrest warrant states that he probably stayed there \"to conceal evidence of the crime and/or the location of [Kirsten's] body,\" reports NBC. Fox 25 reports that the 56-year-old was interviewed after the 1997 disappearance and provided a DNA sample this year when investigators finally tested the evidence and spoke to 10 suspects in the case. Court documents state that the DNA match to the evidence was 293 sextillion to 1. Police believe Palma targeted the girl for sexual assault and killed her soon after her abduction, reports KOCO. Her body has never been found. (A woman thought to have been murdered in 1984 was found alive and well in Dusseldorf.)",

For these reasons, the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment cannot stand.\u201d Leider's attorney called the ruling \"extremely disappointing\" and said evidence showed elephants had died prematurely because of conditions at the zoo. He said he hoped for a retrial before a jury.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 For years, the Los Angeles Zoo has been under a court order requiring it to exercise its three elephants on soft ground and not use electric shocks or barbed sticks on them. On Thursday, that court order was overturned in a unanimous decision by the California Supreme Court that animal activists are decrying. A Los Angeles County Superior Court judge issued the injunction against the zoo in 2012 in response to a taxpayer lawsuit alleging animal cruelty. But in what the Los Angeles Times calls a \"highly technical ruling\" overturning the injunction, the state's highest court said a taxpayer lawsuit (which uses civil law rules) can't be used to address criminal conduct. The taxpayer lawsuit began in 2007 when an LA resident sued over what he said was abusive treatment of the elephants, also including the use of chains and drugs, Courthouse News Service reports. A lawyer who worked on the case, for free, for more than five years says he'll attempt to find another way to get a similar injunction against the zoo, or request that the state legislature overturn the ruling. \"I thought we had done something here to move the ball forward and instead the Supreme Court has allowed the zoo to take a step into the Dark Ages,\" he says. The Supreme Court explained in its ruling that by obtaining the injunction in such a way, the court did not allow the zoo to have a jury trial or the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The barbed sticks known as bull hooks have since been banned entirely in California, and for its part, the zoo says that it has never used and will never use them or electric shocks as disciplinary tools for its elephants, and that it will continue to follow the court order despite it being overturned.",

The main reasons for the giraffe's decline are habitat loss, poaching, and civil unrest in parts of Africa. \"In these war-torn areas, in northern Kenya, Somalia, and Ethiopia in the border area with South Sudan, essentially the Giraffes are war fodder, a large animal, extremely curious that can feed a lot of people,\" says Dr. Julian Fennessy. The population of giraffes in southern Africa is increasing \"two to three times over the last three decades,\" but numbers in East Africa \"have plummeted some by up to 95% of the population\" over the same period. Experts believe the giraffe could be saved with the right conservation efforts.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 No one used to pay much mind to the giraffes that roamed Africa. But new numbers from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature show a significant decline in their population over the past three decades and have conservationists worried that the elegant creature is falling victim to what one IUCN expert calls a \"silent extinction,\" the BBC reports. In 1985, there were between 152,000 and 163,000 giraffes, but that number dropped to 97,000 by 2015\u2014a \"devastating decline\" of nearly 40% that now moves the animal from the \"least concern\" category into the \"vulnerable\" one on the group's Red List. \"While there [has] been great concern about elephants and rhinos, giraffes have gone under the radar,\" says Dr. Fennessy, co-director of the IUCN's Giraffe Conservation arm. The updated Red List, released Thursday at a biological diversity conference in Cancun, Mexico, points to man as the main driver of the declining stats, with poaching, habitat loss, and local unrest all assuming partial blame. A Duke University conservation biologist says the IUCN is partly to blame, too, for not considering more species threatened. \"There's a strong tendency to think that familiar species [such as giraffes, chimps, etc.] must be OK because ... we see them in zoos,\" he tells the AP. \"This is dangerous.\" Some good news, at least for some long-neckers: Of the nine giraffe subspecies, three of them are experiencing increasing populations; one is stable. A resolution passed in September at the IUCN's World Conservation Congress hopes to reverse the falling numbers of \"Africa's iconic megafauna.\" (Three rare giraffes were killed for their tails.)",

Dennis Herrera has been investigating the company since October under a state unfair competition law, targeting its marketing claims that the amount of caffeine in its products is \u201ccompletely safe\u201d and that consumers \u201ccan ever get too Much of a Good thing!\u201d In March, Herrera joined a group of 18 doctors from medical centers across the country in calling for the FDA to regulate caffeine levels in energy drinks, saying the beverages pose health risks, particularly for youths. Under current FDA standards, caffeine in sodas can register no higher than about 71 milligrams per 12-ounce serving. Energy drinks often have between 100 and 300 milligrams of caffeine per 8-oz. serving and are often sold in much larger quantities per can, according to the doctors' letter. In a lawsuit filed Monday in US District Court in Los Angeles, Monster Energy says Herrera's effort would \"impose undue burdens on interstate commerce\" and violate constitutionally protected \"commercial speech\" and other rights. The company, in its lawsuit, maintains that its product has less than half the caffeine of a Starbucks coffee. \"Today, any child can walk into a Starbucks and buy an unlimited number of 'Grande,'\" the lawsuit reads, per the San Francisco Chronicle.",

One thing in particular that irritates Herrera is that the company has a Monster Army website for kids that shows an 11-year-old \"Monster Army Major\" and a 6-year-old \"Reserve,\" reports the San Francisco Chronicle. So, yes, the energy drinks have less caffeine than a cup at Starbucks, but the coffee chain \"isn\u2019t marketing sweet drinks that are highly caffeinated to young people,\u201d says a Herrera spokesperson.
