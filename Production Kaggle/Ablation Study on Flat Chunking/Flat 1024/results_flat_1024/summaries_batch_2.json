He was arrested in southern Israel after an undercover FBI agent posing as a potential suspect placed a call to a Jewish community center in Buffalo, NY. The caller claimed to have a bomb at the center and threatened to blow it up. More than 100 bomb threats were made against US and Australian Jewish institutions over the past few months. The threats were received in 33 states and most came as part of five waves.

Police say the teen used neighbors' internet connections, voice manipulation, and other \"advanced camouflage technologies\" to hide his identity while making threats against Jewish centers in the US, Australia, and New Zealand, the New York Times reports, via Israel Radio. However, police believe he's also responsible for hundreds of other threats around the world over two or three years, reports Haaretz. Those include threats against shopping malls and airports. In one case, he forced a Delta flight to make an emergency landing, police say. Authorities say five computers, antennas, and other equipment were seized from his residence. Per Haaretz, the teen tried to grab the gun of an officer who arrived to arrest him; he was previously found unfit for military service in Israel. Police had previously said they were searching for a single individual believed to be behind the majority of more than 100 bomb threats made against Jewish centers in the US this year. \"This is the guy we are talking about,\" Rosenfeld says. The teen appeared in court on Thursday. (Federal officials have also traced some of the bomb threats to a jilted ex-boyfriend.)",

Neutrinos come in a number of types, and have recently been seen to switch spontaneously from one type to another. The team measured the travel times of neutrino bunches some 16,000 times, and found that the particles sped up 60 billionths of a second earlier than they would have done if they had traveled at the rate of light. This is a tiny fractional change, just 20 parts in a million, but one that occurs consistently. \"This is the first time that we have been able to show that a neutrino travels at a very high speed in a very short period of time,\" says a study co-author.",

She thought it might have been an insect bite, but when she went to her primary care doctor, she said the lesion was still there after she'd finished her antibiotics, researchers write in the Journal of Investigative Medicine, per Live Science. She went to a number of doctors, including a wound healing specialist and a surgeon, before she figured out what was causing the itching. Dr. Enrico Camporesi said the skin around the lesion looked like there was an egg or bean below it, and he feared it could be a lymph node problem, but the surgeon determined it was actually a botfly larva, which had burrowed into the woman's skin. The larva was removed with local anesthesia and a 5 millimeter incision, and by the time the woman came back for a follow-up appointment a week later, the lesion had been \"completely resolved,\" researchers say. botfly eggs are laid on flies and mosquitoes, which in turn carry the eggs to human skin, where they live for up to 128 days, causing itching, per the researchers, who write that \"patients can feel the larvae.\" Botfly infestations are rarely seen in the US, but they are a common skin problem in Central and South America, Live Science reports.

Weeks after returning home, the 36-year-old noticed an itchy spot on the left side of her groin and assumed she'd been bitten by an insect, reports Live Science. Thinking it was an infected spider bite, her doctor fruitlessly prescribed antibiotics. Dr. Enrico Camporesi of Tampa's Memorial Hospital next took a look, noticing a hole in the center of the wound, which felt hard, as though something were inside. A surgeon suspected it was a living thing, and turned out to be right. Cutting open the lesion, doctors found a tapered human botfly larva with rows of spines and hooks meant to keep it buried in the woman's skin for up to 128 days, reports the Miami Herald. Commonly found in Central America, a human botfly first deposits her eggs on an insect, like a mosquito, which carries them to human or animal hosts. Injected in skin via bites, the egg hatches into larva that eventually drops from the skin and continues developing, eventually reaching the size of a large bumblebee, per the Journal of Investigative Medicine High Impact Case Reports. Though the botfly didn't reach the pupa stage in this case, it wasn't necessary for its human host to go under the knife. Belizeans cover lesions\u2014with petroleum jelly, nail polish, and even bacon strips, per the Herald\u2014to suffocate larvae, which emerge for air and can be removed with tweezers. Still, the Florida patient was healed within a week. (Caterpillar larvae might prove useful.)",

She was kept on a cooling blanket for 72 hours and didn't respond to tests that could determine if her brain was dead. On Dec. 5, doctors stopped her ventilator to test if she would ever try to breathe on her own, and she was medically pronounced dead at 9:25am. \"The next day, Paige was not doing well.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 During a White House meeting on Oct. 2, a day into the shutdown, John Boehner slipped out for a smoke. Barack Obama followed him, demanding a private explanation for the shutdown. \"John, what happened?\" he asked. \"I got overrun, that's what happened,\" Boehner replied. That anecdote kicks off Politico's behind-the-scenes look at the crisis. The Wall Street Journal has one too\u2014with different bits of insider gossip. Here are the most interesting tidbits from both: Obama and Harry Reid decided on their no-negotiation strategy over the summer, believing that Boehner could never unite his fractured caucus behind anything. Republicans never believed the pair would stick to it. Boehner and Reid initially struck a deal in which Boehner would pass a sequester-level budget with an ObamaCare-defunding rider that the Senate could simply strip out. Boehner assumed\u2014incorrectly\u2014that his caucus only wanted a show vote. Boehner's former chief of staff was feeding the White House intelligence, telling it that Boehner would have to fight up until the debt ceiling deadline. Reid also took to monitoring Twitter for hints on the GOP's next move\u2014a sign of how badly communication was flowing. Many Republicans turned to Joe Biden, hoping he would intervene. Biden told them he'd been \"sidelined \u2026 at the direction of the president,\" one rep says. Reid, bitter about the fiscal cliff deal Biden negotiated, had wanted him out. At one point, Boehner brought up the idea of a \"grand bargain\" at a White House meeting; Reid laughed in his face. When Paul Ryan joined the fray at an Oct. 10 meeting, he told Obama that he would \"miss his moment\" and derail his whole term if he didn't strike a deal. But he also made what White House aides called a \"Freudian slip,\" saying, \"We\u2019re going to have six weeks to negotiate the debt limit.\" That night, aides to Boehner, Cantor, and Obama began talking about a broader budget deal, and agreed to talk more in the morning. The White House never called. When Mitch McConnell finally decided he had to broker the deal, he partnered with Lamar Alexander\u2014angering Susan Collins, who had worked far harder on the process, only to see her own deal torpedoed. McConnell picked Alexander because he had better conservative credentials, and was pals with Reid confidante Chuck Schumer. Alexander and Schumer brokered the deal behind the scenes, then passed it off to Reid and McConnell. McConnell tells the Washington Post that he saw himself as a backup quarterback thrown into the game. \"I felt like I was on the two-yard line, I had a pretty weak offensive line, and the best I could hope for was to try to punt.\" Boehner made one last-ditch attempt to pass an alternative. \"We're running out of time,\" he told his caucus. \"Your 'no' vote has consequences.\" But as Reid and Obama had predicted, he couldn't convince them. With the ball back in McConnell and Reid's court, McConnell made a few last-minute demands. Reid rejected them. It took all of 15 minutes for McConnell to call back and accept Reid's terms.",

A woman, aged 25 or 26, who has not been identified, was found with blood on her body as she worked at her desk. She initially refused medical treatment and said she was only lightheaded; she didn't indicate she had given birth and previously told coworkers she wasn't pregnant, USA Today reports. Police eventually found the baby, who appeared to be full-term, though reports differ on whether the child was beneath the woman's desk or in a drawer. Fox 2 reports the baby was dead when it was initially found, but was pronounced dead at a hospital after failed resuscitation attempts. The mother was also taken to the hospital. The woman was an employee of temp agency Level Professional Services, which has worked with CEVA Logistics since October. A CEVA rep tells the Detroit News that the company \"is cooperating fully with the authorities in their ongoing investigation and is providing counseling to its employees at the facility.\" An autopsy was performed by the Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office on Wednesday and the results should be available in two weeks, Redford police say.

Per CNN, Idaho State University has not been able to account for the bit of radioactive material since 2003 but, nonetheless, believes it was properly stored at a licensed disposal facility. However, with no documented proof, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Friday it must propose the fine. Dr. Cornelis Van der Schyf, vice president for research at the university, blamed partially completed paperwork from 15 years ago as the school tried to dispose of the plutonium. \"Unfortunately, because there was a lack of sufficient historical records to demonstrate the disposal pathway employed in 2003, the source in question had to be listed as missing,\" he said in a statement to the AP. The statement said the plutonium \"poses no direct health issue or risk to public safety.\" The plutonium was being used to develop ways to ensure nuclear waste containers weren't leaking and to find ways to detect radioactive material being illegally brought into the US following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. While the missing amount could not be used to make a nuclear bomb, it could be used to create a so-called dirty bomb to spread nuclear contamination. The university, which has 30 days to dispute the proposed fine, reported the plutonium missing on Oct. 13, according to documents released by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The agency said a school employee doing a routine inventory discovered the university could only account for 13 of its 14 plutonium sources, each weighing about the same small amount.",

The study in the Frontiers in Psychology looked at two popular massively multiplayer online games\u2014EverQuest II in North America and Chevaliers' Romance III in China\u2014and confirmed prior findings that men and women don't have the same goals in playing video games. They also confirmed that men enjoy competitive games while women prefer cooperative ones, while men appear to embrace the title; women are more likely to choose supportive character classes, such as Priests and Healers while men gravitate toward the Barbarians. But the ultimate measure of a gamer isn't what class or guild he or she identifies with\u2014it's his or her level in the game. After analyzing data from more than 9,000 EverQuest II players and 2,000 Chevalier's Romance III players, the researchers found that players who registered as female reach lower levels, on average, than their male peers. \"Once you take into account all these confounding factors, the gender differences disappear,\" says Cuihua Shen, one of the study's co-authors, in a press release.",

But in terms of the bottom line: advancing to a higher level, the difference was nil among the 11,000 gamers they analyzed playing Everquest II and Chevalier's Romance III. Aside from one study in 2009, Vocativ reports that this is the first to figure out how to go about testing gender differences in gaming performance outside of a lab. Why does it matter? Nearly half the gaming population is now female, yet they are represented at even lower numbers in STEM fields of science, technology, engineering, and math. \"The stereotype that women are worse players at games could contribute to a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" Shen says.

In the suit, Stacy Stevens says she didn't know about her husband's gambling habit until he told her in a phone call on Jan. 30, 2012, that he had \"taken some money\" from the company he worked for and was going home without a job. \"Stace, I have something to tell you,\" Stevens said on the phone. \"Who died?\" The Indiana 72-year-old lawyer who's filed lawsuits against casinos on behalf of pathological gamblers says his latest suit is the first against a casino for negligence. \"The manufacturers know these machines are addictive and do their best to make them addictive so they can make more money,\" says Terry Noffsinger, the lawyer for Stevens. \"This isn't negligence. It's intentional.\" Stevens had been on paid leave from the Detroit police department for about a month when he became addicted to video poker, which he played on his own time at the casino and on the weekends with friends. The Detroit Free Press reports that Stevens had lost about $10,000 of his own money during the time he was off duty. Stevens' wife, Stacy, and their three daughters are now suing International Game Technology, the company that makes slot machines at West Virginia's Mountaineer Casino and Resort, accusing it of \"perpetuating a system carefully calibrated to prey upon his weakness, one that robbed him of his money, his hope, and ultimately his life.\" The lawsuit seeks $5 billion in damages.",

Scott Stevens was a successful Ohio finance exec whose life started unraveling in 2006 after a trade show in Vegas. For six years, his gambling habit spiraled out of control: He sneaked off to gamble when his wife thought he was working, embezzled nearly $4 million from his firm, and drained his family's savings\u2014until the day in 2012 he decided to end his life. After his suicide, Stacy started researching gambling addiction (she hadn't even known about her husband's problem) and filed suit against the West Virginia casino where he was a regular, as well as the maker of the slot machines there. Experts relay how casinos track and target addicted gamblers, supply ready flows of cash via on-site ATMs, and offer plenty of perks to keep them coming back. But it's the modern-day slot machines themselves, with deceptive technology called virtual reel mapping, that seem to be designed to lull gamblers into a trance\u2014or what the industry refers to as \"continuous gaming productivity\"\u2014so they don't stop playing. While the casinos and machine manufacturers place the blame for gambling addictions on individuals, Terry Noffsinger, the lead attorney for the Stevens suit, says these addictive machines are not due to \"negligence. It's intentional.\" Stacy Stevens lost her case in West Virginia, but Noffsinger believes the movement to hold casinos accountable for addicts will gain momentum, much like how the tobacco industry eventually paid for sickening its own customers. \"The public is learning more about it,\" he says.

Kennedy's PT-109, found the ship off Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific during World War II, the New York Times reports. The ship was part of a \"Magic Carpet\" fleet that transported war prisoners to the US before Japan's invasion, and it was used in the test explosion at Bikini Atoll on July 1, 1946. The bomb exploded off the ship's port quarter, \"causing massive blast damage in that area, and progressively less further forward,\" according to a press release. After the test, the Independence left Bikini for San Francisco, where it was placed within a half-mile of ground zero for a second explosion. But the ship didn't sink: It was raised in 1995 and spent the next 20 years at the bottom of the ocean as a museum ship. On Tuesday, Ballard found the first images he'd ever seen of the ship, which was sunk by the Japanese in the Battle of Ley. The US Geological Survey found it while mapping the seafloor in 1990, but until now, there had been no photos or video of the Independence in its final resting place.

It is quiet no longer as the Centers for Disease Control confirms what appear to be about 90 cases across 33 states so far this year, and three of them are in Oregon, home to the first case in 2014, reports the Oregonian. Washington, which saw only a couple cases in 2014, appears to be suffering from something of an outbreak, with nine cases so far this year including the first suspected fatality; a 6-year-old boy is believed to have died from the illness, reports MyNorthwest.com. The illness is not contagious, according to doctors, but it's not clear how people contract it. Little is known about AFM, though it's been linked to enteroviruses as well as West Nile and related viruses, and there is no treatment other than comfort care. It affects the nervous system, particularly the spinal cord, and telltale symptoms include weakness and paralysis. \"If a child or adult is experiencing any kind of weakness at all, they should see their health care provider immediately,\" Oregon's public health division spokesperson tells KATU. Aside from Daniel Ramirez, the 6-year-old taken off life support last week, most kids appear to make partial to even full recoveries. KOMO News reports that a teenager afflicted in Washington in 2014 still needs a wheelchair but continues to improve and hopes to go to college soon.

Here's what people are saying: Obama is on track to have \"two horrible, terrible, awful midterm elections in a row,\" writes Stuart Rothenberg at Roll Call. Harry Truman lost a total of 83 House seats during his two midterms in 1946 and 1950, while Dwight Eisenhower lost a combined 66 House seats in the 1954 and 1958 midterms. Obama had one midterm where his party lost 63 House seats, and Democrats are expected to lose another 5 to possibly 12 House seats (or more), taking the sitting president's total midterm House loses to the 68 seat to 75 seat range. \"The answer, most obviously, is, 'Yes,'\" Rothenberg writes. \"He failed to show leadership on key issues and never successfully moved to a more diverse political center.\" The GOP is expected to keep control of the Senate, but if the party does manage a majority, it won't be for long, writes Chris Cillizza at Politico. \"We shift the ground from where it was this time\u2014seven Democrats were running in states that Obama didn't carry\u2014to an environment where seven Republican senators are running in\u2014Democrats have reason to be optimistic about their chances of retaking the Senate in 2016, thanks in part to what Politico calls a \"favorable climate.\"",

Consider that Democrats lost 63 seats in the 2010 midterms are expected to lose five to 12 (or maybe more) seats on Tuesday. No president has lost as many in back-to-back midterms since Harry Truman lost 83 in 1946 and 1950, writes Stuart Rothenberg. Dwight Eisenhower managed to lose a total of 66, but Obama seems on track to top him. More typical is the pattern of Bill Clinton, who lost 54 in 1994 but bounced back with a gain of five in 1998. Still, if Tuesday is shaping up to be a night of celebration for the GOP, Politico offers a reality check, at least in the Senate: Several first-term Republicans in vulnerable states will be up for re-election in 2016. So even if Republicans win a small majority this year, they might have to give it right back two years later.",

The tweet came after Trump met with the CEOs of Boeing and Lockheed Martin on Wednesday, the AP reports. Lockheed is building the US Air Force's next generation of F-35 fighter jets, and Trump has complained about the $379 billion cost of the program. \"We're trying to get costs down,\" Trump said after the meeting. \"It's a very, very expensive program.\" The Pentagon has ordered 2,456 of the planes at a cost of $6.1 billion per jet, more than the cost of all wars put together, the Christian Science Monitor reports. The F-35 is supposed to replace the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy fighter jets that have been in service. Lockheed was supposed to deliver 2,443 of the jets to the United States, UK, and five other countries by 2030, Business Insider reports. Instead, the Pentagon has orders for 2,454, and it's expected to deliver them by 2029. Lockheed's share price plunged almost 2% in after-hours trading after Trump's tweet, the culmination of weeks of interference by the president-elect in the arcane, bureaucratic function of federal procurement. In early December, Trump tweeted that the costs of the new Air Force One planes are \"out of control.\" A Boeing rep tells the Wall Street Journal, \"We will fight to protect our jobs.",

Lockheed shares, which went down 4% after an earlier Trump tweet, dived 2% in after-hours trading, while Boeing was up 0.7%. A roundup of coverage: Politico takes a close look at the implications of Trump involving himself so closely in the federal procurement process and turning it into a \"$440 billion weapon.\" Presidents including Obama have used the process to advance their agendas, but experts say it's unprecedented for one to target individual companies and contracts the way Trump is doing\u2014and his approach is likely to create great uncertainty for defense companies. Business Insider looks at the F-35's capabilities\u2014and the $379 billion contract for Lockheed to supply 2,443 of them to the military. Pentagon officials involved with the F-35 says the fifth-generation jet is far ahead of the Boeing plane, meaning it would take years of redesigning and testing for the Super Hornet to have the same capabilities. The AP reports that Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher said: \"We have committed to working with the president-elect and his administration to provide the best capability, deliverability, and affordability,\" while Lockheed declined to comment. Bloomberg reports that Trump's action \"sidelined decades of policy and practice in how the government spends billions of dollars annually on military hardware.\" A Teal Group military aircraft analyst tells Bloomberg that Trump's tweet was \"bizarre,\" especially since only the Navy uses the Super Hornet, while the Marines are \"completely dependent\" on F-35Bs and the Air Force is sticking with the F-35A. \"Thus, Trump's tweet is both late to the game and completely irrelevant.\" Retired Rear Adm. Dave Oliver tells Politico that Trump's attempt to bring the tactics of the New York real estate market to military procurement will probably just drive prices up. \"He will scare the bejesus out of some fifth-level auditor who is going to say, 'Goodness gracious, maybe I ought to look at whoever he is attacking at the moment,' says Oliver, who was a top Pentagon acquisition official in the 1990s. \"Whether the president has any legal standing of any kind in this doesn't matter.

They released a joint statement saying the bill doesn't do enough to repeal ObamaCare. The bill's writing was cloaked in such secrecy that the Week reports as of Thursday morning quite a few Republican senators still had not seen it; Murkowski, for example, told a reporter, \"I am not a reporter, and I am not a lobbyist, so I've seen nothing.\" President Trump had called the House bill \"mean\" and in need of \"more heart.\" So Scientific American takes a look to see if the Senate version fulfills that requirement.

Before the result was announced Sunday, US Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan said the US would not recognize the election winner, reports Reuters. He said the US is considering oil sanctions on Venezuela, though Washington wants to target \"corrupt regime officials,\" not \"damage the country in a way that makes it difficult to repair after democracy is restored.\" Maduro told supporters outside the presidential palace in Caracas that his \"truly popular victory\" had been achieved through an \"impeccable electoral process,\" but Falcon and other critics said irregularities including widespread vote-buying made the results invalid and called for new elections, the Guardian reports. Reuters notes that after voting, residents of the crisis-stricken country were asked to scan their government-issued \"fatherland cards\"\u2014which are required to claim benefits\u2014at pro-Maduro tents near polling stations to qualify for a \"prize\" from the socialist leader. Officials said turnout out was 46.1%, down from 80% in 2013, though critics said even that number was inflated and the true figure was closer to 30%.",

That's partly because of the movie Wild, which tells the story of hiker Cheryl Strayed's attempt to walk the trail from California to Oregon. \"There are a whole lot of people that are going to be inspired to hit the PCT because of Wild and we really care about making sure that people are traveling safely,\" a rep for the trail's association tells the magazine. Still, overcrowding is an issue. \"Deserts are fragile,\" an expert tells Outside. \"They're more susceptible to damage and when damage occurs, it lasts longer.\" And that's why the number of permits issued under a quota system that caps them at 50 per day was only introduced in 2015. \"As a direct response to the spike in numbers, the main aim of the quota system is to spread the numbers out and wear on the trail and environmental damage,\" outdoors writer Pete Brook writes in the Los Angeles Times. \"This is especially important in the desert environments that dominate.\" There are no official numbers on how many hikers use the trail each year, but 2,800 long-distance permits were issued in 2015.

But don't take his word for it: The Pacific Crest Trail Association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail. To put things in perspective: 300 people attempted to complete the entire PCT in 2006, according to the AP, with about 120 of those making it. In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the PCTA's Jack Haskel told the AP in 2015. But after the movie, starring Reese Witherspoon, was released in 2014, interest in the PCT exploded. \"Millions are hearing about it now and are being inspired,\" Haskel said. Strayed, more or less unprepared for the journey, hiked 1,100 miles of the trail as a form of therapy as she grappled with personal demons. \"However for others that follow her strategy of deliberate ineptitude, things might not turn out so well,\" writes DontHikeLikeWild.org. \"Our advice to would-be hikers: Grow a spine first.

Before her death, Mann had said she feared for her safety on the anonymous app, which allows users to post without revealing their names. \"Gonna tie these feminists to the radiator and grape them in the mouth,\" one post on the app read, per CNNMoney. Mann was particularly vocal about an incident in which the school's rugby team engaged in chants calling for violence against women\u2014including rape and necrophilia. Members of the rugby team mistakenly thought the group called for the college to suspend the team's members, and the group says it was subjected to more than 700 sexist, threatening Yaks in the days before Mann's death. \"What we're seeing is increased use of [Yik Yak] for cyberbullying over race, gender, and sexual orientation,\" says an attorney with the Feminist Majority Foundation.

The group says there were 1,267 reported sightings in 2015, up from 1,981 in 2012, CTV News reports. \"We do know that the UFO reports continue to be made in growing numbers every year and this is just indicative that people are paying attention to what is in the sky,\" researcher Chris Rutkowski says. \"They're not just looking down at their cellphones.\" According to the survey, most sightings can be explained by stars, planets, fireballs, aircraft, and police helicopters, but about 12% of the sightings remain unexplained despite information from other sources. In 2015, there was an \"unusual number of cases from Quebec, in fact three or four times,\" Rutkowski tells CTV. He says the unexplained numbers are \"a more manageable number of one or two or three per cent.\" The group\u2014which surveyed 17 sources including Transport Canada, the National UFO Reporting Center, and YouTube\u2014believes the increase in sightings may be related to reports of a supposed \"end-of-days\" phenomenon from the Mayan calendar. \"The ridicule factor is quite certainly there, but we\u2019re not saying the little grey.\" The CBC has some of the craziest sightings from 2015.",

Only 2012 had more, with 1,981 sightings.

Montreal led Canadian cities with 97 reports, followed by 78 in Toronto, and 69 in Vancouver. That doesn't mean there were that many unexplained cases; about 88% of unidentifiable objects turn out to be stars, planets, airplanes, or helicopters, Rutkowski says. Ufology Research investigates the remaining cases\u2014by visiting a site and talking to witnesses\u2014to determine if a case is \"high quality.\" About 1% to 3% of cases fall into this group, Rutkowski says.

In the plea deal, prosecutors agreed not to bring charges against Cohen based on his statements to Congress about payments he made to women \"in exchange for their silence\" about alleged affairs with Trump, including a $130,000 payment to Karen McDougal in 2015. The deal also calls for the government to pay Cohen's legal fees.

The researchers injected the mice with a small molecule known as a sonic hedgehog pathway agonist. The compound, which has not been proven safe for human use, is designed to boost normal growth via a gene known as SHH. The gene provides instructions for making a protein called sonic hedgehog, which is essential for development. The injection also led to unexpected benefits in learning and memory, normally handled by a different part of the brain known as the hippocampus. \"Down syndrome is very complex, and nobody thinks there's going to be a silver bullet that normalizes cognition,\" says Reeves.",

The molecule is called sonic hedgehog pathway agonist, and it was administered to mice who were genetically altered to have characteristics akin to those of Down syndrome. The molecule, which is not approved as safe for humans, spurs a gene to make a protein tied to development. \"Most people with Down syndrome have a cerebellum that's about 60% of the normal size,\" says one of the Johns Hopkins researchers. Science World Report notes that the mice were injected on the day they were born, at which point their cerebellums hadn't fully developed. The single injection appeared to normalize the cerebellum's growth. In an added surprise, memory and learning, \"which are generally controlled by the hippocampus, not the cerebellum,\" were also positively affected. But the researcher explains that applying the treatment to humans is a tricky proposition, and could have unintended consequences, like raising cancer risk.",
