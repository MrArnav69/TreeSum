Libyan revolutionary fighters took the city of Sirte today, and in the process captured the former strongman, who was wounded in both legs while trying to flee the city in a convoy that NATO planes attacked, a senior NTC official tells Reuters. \"He was also hit in his head,\" the official said. \"There was a lot of firing against his group and he died.\" US officials are working to confirm the report. The Guardian has a photo that purports to depict a bloody Gadhafi here (Warning: it's graphic). The strike also reportedly killed the head of Gadhafi's armed forces, Abu Bakr Younus Jabr. Earlier, AP reporters watched as rebels fought a 90-minute battle to rout pro-Gadhafi fighters from their remaining neighborhoods in Sirte, apparently ending the last major battle of the Libyan war. \"Sirte has been liberated. There are no Gadhafi forces anymore,\" an NTC colonel said. \"We are now chasing his fighters who are trying to run away.\" Not all Gadhafi forces are running through; the Telegraph says there are reports of some taking off their uniforms and firing indiscriminately on civilians.

Dorner would need serious survival gear if he is indeed still in the woods somewhere. His mother owns undeveloped land in the region, but a search of it turned up nothing. Of course, given Dorner's boasts of planning to bring \"warfare\" to the LAPD, authorities have to be on guard that they're not walking into a trap, reports AP.

Their power can be destroyed very easily if unfortunate things make them look more wicked.

The clarification comes a few days after a Time story claimed that the review involved searching by keywords and not checking every email. A Clinton spokesman blames the confusion on a fact sheet provided after a press conference last week, which mentioned keyword searches. \"We simply took for granted that reading every single email came across as the most important, fundamental, and exhaustive step that was performed,\" he said in a statement to Fox. \"The fact sheet should have been clearer in stating that every email was read.\" But while the 31,830 emails appear to be gone forever, it doesn't look like the controversy for Clinton is going to go away anytime soon. House Speaker John Boehner plans to announce a new probe this week into Clinton's email use, including the deletions, according to ABC News, which cites \"top House Republicans.\" And it's not just Clinton's emails that are gone: The State Department has admitted that routine archiving of the inboxes of senior officials only began last month. \"It's very troubling,\" a spokesman for the National Security Archive group tells Politico. \"People in the community of record-keepers and historians had known that our history was at risk for a long time.\"",

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Long lines at polling sites in Arizona's March 22 primary led Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton to call the night a \"fiasco\"\u2014and the Justice Department to now investigate whether there were civil rights violations regarding what Stanton called \"unacceptably disparate distribution of polling locations,\" Reuters reports. The DoJ's civil rights division penned a letter Friday asking Maricopa County, the state's most populous, to determine if federal law was violated regarding, among other things, the number and location of polling sites (the county cut them from 200 to 60 in 2012 in an apparent bid to save money). The Justice Department's reason for this request: reports of \"disproportional burden in waiting times \u2026 in some areas with substantial racial or language minority populations,\" the letter noted. Those waiting times were incredibly inconvenient: The AP notes that some voters waited nearly six hours, with the last vote cast at almost 1am at one site; polls had closed at 7pm, but voters already in line at that point were allowed to cast ballots. Poll workers even reportedly brought pizza to hungry voters. Maricopa County has until April 22 to respond to the DoJ's letter, which included 10 specific requests for information, including polling locations, procedures, and response to public backlash, the Arizona Republic reports. \"We are going to gather the information \u2026 and we will make it public,\" the county elections director says.

Before the US gets any deeper into the operation, the president should open this up for a full debate in Congress, says the editorial. It's also \"puzzling\" that in preparing the nation on Sept. 10 for these airstrikes, Obama said nothing about the Khorasan group that is suddenly Public Enemy No. 1. \"There isn\u2019t a full picture\u2014because Mr. Obama has not provided one\u2014of how this bombing campaign will degrade the extremist groups without unleashing unforeseen consequences in a violent and volatile region,\" says the editorial. \"In the absence of public understanding or discussion and a coherent plan, the strikes in Syria were a bad decision.\" Agree: The airstrikes are a \"major reversal\" for a president who opposed intervention in Syria for so long, writes the Los Angeles Times in an editorial. Can we trust that he won't reverse himself on ground troops, too? Yes, ISIS and the Khorasan group pose threats to US interests, \"but is the threat serious enough to justify an ever-escalating role for the US military in Syria and Iraq?\" asks the editorial. \"Does the US have a clear strategy and achievable aims? The case has yet to be made.\" Disagree: The Wall Street Journal editorial board not only applauds the airstrikes but thinks US ground troops should be ready to move quickly. If the mission is to succeed, and it must, they'll be needed to direct airstrikes as militants hide in populated areas. \"No US President should ever start a war he doesn't intend to win, and wars rarely go as smoothly as advertised in advance,\" concludes the editorial. \"Now that he has attacked ISIS, Mr. Obama must show that America is the strong horse.\"",

The AP reports that explosions lit up the skies over Damascus, the Syrian capital, as Trump announced the airstrikes from the White House. Syrian television reported that Syrian air defenses have responded to the attack. Trump says the US is prepared to \"sustain\" pressure on Assad until he ends what the president calls a criminal pattern of killing his own people with internationally banned chemical weapons. It was not immediately clear whether Trump meant the allied military operation would extend beyond an initial nighttime round of missile strikes. Trump did not provide details on the joint US-British-French attack, but it was expected to include barrages of cruise missiles launched from outside Syrian airspace. He described the main aim as establishing \"a strong deterrent\" against chemical weapons use. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. French President Emmanuel Macron confirmed the attack, saying it was launched against a \"clandestine chemical arsenal\" run by Syria's government, the AP reports. Macron says France's \"red line has been crossed\" after a suspected chemical attack last week in the Syrian town of Douma. The US decision to strike marked Trump's second order to attack Syria; he authorized a barrage of Tomahawk cruise missiles to hit a single Syrian airfield in April 2017 in retaliation for Assad's use of sarin gas against civilians.",

Is this not what we want for our own children?\" Marriage: In what Slate says is \"almost certainly an allusion\" to gay marriage, Francis lamented the state of the modern family. It is \"threatened, perhaps as never before, from within and without,\" he said. \"Fundamental relationships are being called into question, as is the very basis of marriage and the family. I can only reiterate the importance and, above all, the richness and the beauty of family life.\" Climate change: He said the US has an \"important role to play\" in reversing the \"environmental deterioration caused by human activity,\" reports CNBC. \"Now is the time for courageous actions and strategies.\" Arms trade: He told lawmakers from the world's largest exporter of weapons that the arms trade must end, reports the AP.

Little else is known about human hepegivirus-1, or HHpgV-1, besides that it looks a bit like hepatitis C and the harmless and perhaps beneficial human pegivirus. \"It is the first transfusion-associated virus that's been described in a long time,\" a researcher tells NBC News. He adds \"we don't know if it is going to be a significant cause of human hepatitis,\" but scientists say it's unlikely. In fact, \"it may be good for you.\" They first found the virus in blood samples from two volunteers, part of a study of 46, who received blood transfusions to treat hemophilia between 1974 and 1980. The virus only appeared after transfusions, but both patients cleared it and showed no sign of disease. Two more cases were found among 106 who'd received plasma, per mBio; both cleared the virus, though one was infected for five years. Even if the virus is harmful, researchers say there's no need to panic. \"This is not SARS. This is not MERS. This is not HIV,\" says an expert. Whereas blood transfusions were once performed solely with human blood products, they now use genetically engineered products. Plus, blood is screened more carefully and stricter policies better control who donates blood compared to 25 years ago. \"Does it cause trouble that would justify any response with blood safety? I don\u2019t think we're at that level,\" a pathologist at the Blood Systems Research Institute tells Science. Scientists have yet to isolate the virus but say the next step is to develop an antibody test to find HHpgV-1 in a larger population. Afterward, experts can determine whether those with HHpgV-1 antibodies appear less healthy than those without the virus and look for links to disease.

So with the SCOTUS decision over the summer to legalize gay marriage, the men looked forward to finally tying the knot. But one issue is holding them back: Esposito is technically Bosee's father, because he adopted him in 2012. \"We thought never in our lifetime\u2014or in 20 lifetimes\u2014...same-sex marriage [would] happen,\" Bosee said, adding to CNN that the adoption \"gave us the most legitimate thing available to us\" at the time. Even though they petitioned to have the adoption annulled, Allegheny County Judge Lawrence O'Toole \u2014known for being progressive on LGBT issues\u2014rejected that plea, noting that adoptions are typically only dissolved when fraud is involved and that nixing theirs \"would place in jeopardy and imperil adoption decrees generally.\" Adoptions of this sort are often sought to cement legal status for financial and other reasons, as well as to strengthen emotional ties. The men said it was both: Esposito told the Post-Gazette \"we felt we lacked a family of our own,\" but they also discovered that any money they inherited from each other would be subject to a much greater inheritance tax if they weren't considered relatives. One person on the couple's side: Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey, who tells the Post-Gazette, \"I wasn't aware that LGBT couples were turning to this method. I can't even imagine having to get an adoption petition approved \u2026 to visit a loved one in the hospital.\" Casey has written a letter of support to AG Loretta Lynch, asking her office to \"consider issuing guidance\" in cases like this; her office is reviewing it, a rep tells CNN.

New satellite imaging from NASA has revealed these so-called \"understory fires.\" Flames are only a few feet high, and the fires themselves move only a few feet per minute, but they can last several weeks, reports Nature World News. The culprit? Careless humans, apparently. These fires generally occur near populated areas, and they're often set off by campfires or discarded cigarettes\u2014aided and abetted by low humidity. NASA researchers say the discovery of the fires will affect climate models. \"We don't yet have a robust estimate of what the net carbon emissions are from understory fires, but widespread damages suggest that they are important source of emissions that we need to consider,\" says one.",

Sky News reports foreign ships aren't an uncommon occurrence in Japan: 44 have washed ashore this year; 66 did so in 2016. The BBC presents a theory as to why: Some believe North Korea has been calling for more seafood to be fished in order to feed a hungry population. The increased demand may be leading its citizens to take boats that are in subpar condition far off its shores. And as a professor with Japan's Tokai University tells Sky News, the Sea of Japan \"starts to get choppy when November comes. It gets dangerous when northwesterly winds start to blow.\" Kyodo notes the boat that carried the eight live men has vanished; police are reviewing both cases.

The FBI says the other four devices found will be encased in blastproof material and taken to the agency's headquarters for further investigation, the New York Times reports. The devices\u2014which were discovered by two men who found the backpack on top of a garbage can outside a restaurant near the Elizabeth station\u2014will be closely examined for evidence linking them to explosive devices found in New York City and elsewhere in New Jersey over the weekend. A round-up of coverage: Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage says the two men thought the backpack held something of value and carried it some distance before realizing it held explosive devices and calling police, NJ.com. He says in its original location near a pub, the devices could have caused carnage. \"If that pub was crowded and there was a lot of people there, it could have severely injured, killed and maimed many, many people,\" the mayor says. The AP reports that thousands of Amtrak and NJ Transit passengers were affected by the discovery of the device, with some stuck on trains for hours. Service has resumed but passengers in the area have been warned that they can expect delays Monday. NBC New York reports that investigators believe surveillance video shows the same man at two locations where explosive devices were found in Manhattan. Police aren't sure whether there is a link between the New York devices and those found in New Jersey. CNN reports that there is now an increased security presence in New York City not just because of the bombs, but because world leaders are gathering for the United Nations General Assembly. A law enforcement source tells CBS that investigators believe cell phones were used as triggers for both the Manhattan blast\u2014which NY Gov. Andrew Cuomo calls \"obviously an act of terrorism\"\u2014and the device that exploded before a New Jersey race to benefit Marines and sailors early Saturday. It's not clear whether a trigger was found with the Elizabeth devices. Bollwage says he's not sure his city was targeted. He suspects somebody may have just dumped the devices in Elizabeth, but he is \"extremely concerned for everyone in the state and country where someone can just go and drop a backpack into a garbage can that has multiple explosives in it with no timers and then you have to wonder how many people could have been hurt.\" An official close to the investigation tells Reuters that all the devices involved have been crude and the level of planning appears low\u2014but some investigators fear this was just a test. \"That's what worries us,\" he says. \"Was this some kind of test run, not just of the devices, but also of the surveillance in New York and the response?\" (The FBI says it is questioning five people found in a \"vehicle of interest.\")",

In California, \"it has become increasingly apparent that we are not dealing with a few [well-separated] faults, but with a vast interconnected fault system,\" he says.

At least, that's what appears to be the reason behind a gift Trump is reportedly giving Kim, to be delivered via Secretary of State Mike Pompeo while he's in North Korea this week: a CD with Elton John's song \"Rocket Man,\" per the Chosun Ilbo's sources. Late last year, Trump often referred to Kim\u2014and not in a complimentary way\u2014as \"Rocket Man\" or \"Little Rocket Man\" in tweets and speeches, leading Kim to fire back that Trump was a \"mentally deranged US dotard.\" Apparently the \"Rocket Man\" epithet came up when the two leaders met at last month's summit in Singapore, and Trump discovered that Kim had never heard the Elton John song. And so the CD (reportedly signed by Trump) ended up in Pompeo's luggage, along with a letter to Kim. Gizmodo, which calls \"Rocket Man\" a \"damn good song,\" notes Trump seems fixated on the 1972 hit, which became a staple of sorts at his rallies while he was campaigning for the presidency.

This was a government-funded policy of genocide.\" Indeed, as the Washington Post reports, Minneapolis is home to a sizable Native American presence, perhaps contributing to the size of the demonstration. The issue is compounded by the University of Minnesota, which currently leases its football stadium to the Vikings for a hefty $300,000 per game.

More: A candidate needs 50% of the vote to take the seat, which most news outlets agree is unlikely to happen. Moore leads in some polls at around 35% support, with Strange and Brooks in a close race for second. Should Trump's favorite be eliminated, it \"will call into question the influence of Trump's support in a reliably Republican state,\" per Politico. Not that Trump should be too disappointed with Brooks or Moore. Both are \"Trumpian candidates,\" reports Axios. McConnell has a huge interest in the race, though. He and his allies have invested millions in Strange's campaign. Also key: Brooks has said he wants McConnell \"fired.\" Not helping Brooks, however, is a controversial campaign ad he aired that included audio from the shooting of Steve Scalise, reports NBC News. Strange is likewise plagued by his appointment by former Gov. Robert Bentley in what some suspect was \"a corrupt bargain to end the state's criminal investigation of Bentley,\" the New Republic previously reported. Reuters mentions the candidates' stances on issues like gay marriage and illegal immigration. The winner of the runoff election is likely to face one of two Democrats in December: either former US Attorney Doug Jones, backed by Joe Biden, or Robert Kennedy Jr., a Navy veteran with no relation to the famous Kennedy family, per Politico. Either way, the Republican winner will be sitting pretty. Alabama hasn't elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1992, per the New York Times. Polls close at 8pm EDT.",

For the first time in history, human-induced climate change has been found \"solely or primarily\" responsible for the extinction of a mammal species, according to a new study. The Bramble Cay melomys, or mosaic-tailed rat, was found by Europeans on a tiny coral cay off the coast of Queensland, Australia, in 1845 and became known as the only mammal species endemic to the Great Barrier Reef, reports the Guardian. But though there were hundreds still in existence on Bramble Cay in 1978, the last were spotted by a fisherman in 2009, reports AFP. Researchers from the University of Queensland and the Queensland government\u2014who traveled to Bramble Cay in 2014 and laid 150 traps for six nights to no avail\u2014say \"the only known population of this rodent is now extinct.\" Researchers found the cay, which sits about 10 feet above sea level, had flooded several times, wiping out the animals and their habitat. Just 2.5 hectares of land remained above high tide, reports Newsweek. \"Significantly, this probably represents the first recorded mammalian extinction due to anthropogenic climate change,\" the researchers say\u2014though they hope the animals reached the island on debris from Papua New Guinea and still survive there. Researchers say extreme weather was a factor in the extinction of the Little Swan Island hutia, a rodent once found on an atoll off Honduras, but cats were also to blame. \"If this is one of the first\" extinctions solely linked to humans, \"it is more than likely not going to be the last,\" says an ecologist. \"Species restricted to small, low lying islands, or those with very tight environmental requirements are likely to be the first to go.\" (Five islands have already vanished.)",

A federal judge agrees in the case of Michael Cohen, approving on Friday a 90-day stay in the civil lawsuit against him and President Trump by Stephanie Clifford (aka porn star Stormy Daniels), the Washington Post reports. The reasoning: Trump's personal lawyer filed a declaration this week noting he intends to plead the Fifth in the Daniels case, as he fears answering questions in that matter could potentially implicate himself in the criminal probe against him in New York, per NPR. FBI agents working on the latter investigation carried out a raid on Cohen's home and office in early April, and because part of that mission was to seek documents related to Daniels' nondisclosure agreement, there may be \"large potential factual overlap\" with Daniels' civil case, per Otero. \"This is no simple criminal investigation,\" Otero noted Friday. \"Whether or not an indictment is forthcoming, and the Court thinks it likely based on these facts alone, these unique circumstances counsel in favor of stay.\" Daniels' lawyer, Michael Avenatti, responded to Otero's ruling on Twitter, tweeting: \"While we certainly respect Judge Otero's 90 day stay order based on Mr. Cohen's pleading of the 5th, we do not agree with it. We will likely be filing an immediate appeal to the Ninth Circuit early next week. Justice delayed is justice denied.\" He added to the New York Times that \"we want to get the truth to the American people as quickly as possible.\" The Post, however, notes it's not unusual for those facing both civil and criminal issues to do exactly what Cohen's doing to avoid incrimination. The next hearing for the civil case has been set for July 27.",

That conclusion comes thanks to fat, reports Phys.org. Ilya Bobrovskiy of Australian National University discovered a Dickinsonia fossil in 300-foot-high cliffs along the White Sea in northwest Russia, in a place so remote she reached it via helicopter. The fossil was superbly preserved, so much so that its tissue had cholesterol molecules present in it. \"The fossil fat molecules that we've found prove that animals were large and abundant 558 million years ago, millions of years earlier than previously thought,\" says ANU professor Jochen Brocks, co-author of the paper on the discovery, which was published in Science. The Cambrian explosion that gave rise to modern animal groups didn't happen for another 20 million years or so. As for the oval Dickinsonia's appearance, the BBC describes it as possibly bearing \"a superficial resemblance to a segmented jellyfish.\" National Geographic delves into the difficulty of studying Ediacarans, who had no shells or bones to leave behind and whose \"squishy bodies have long since decayed.\" Read more on how the team overcame that here.",

The combination could result in the death penalty, which is rare in India. Also rare in India: The trial will be fast-tracked. (Click for more details that have leaked from the filing.)

According to planning documents obtained by Newsweek, the Department of Defense is aware of nearly 200 armed militias already operating along the southwest border. \"Reported incidents of unregulated militias stealing National Guard equipment during deployments,\" reads an intelligence assessment for the Pentagon by the Joint Force Land Component Commander Threat Working Group. \"They operate under the guise of citizen patrols supporting CBP [Customs and Border Protection] primarily between POEs [Points of Entry].\" The documents analyze four points of entry including one in Brownsville, Texas, and another in the San Ysidro district of San Diego, Calif. The assessment jibes with media reports that militia members are already heading for the border, the Washington Post reports. They include the Texas Minutemen, who apparently have 100 armed volunteers going to the Rio Grande. \"I can\u2019t put a number on it,\" says Shannon McGauley, who leads the group. \"My phone\u2019s been ringing nonstop for the last seven days.\" Meanwhile, members of another group\u2014the Patriots of the Constitution militia\u2014arrived last week in Columbus, New Mexico, per the Albuquerque Journal.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 \"Are we really willing to risk Los Angeles or Chicago in retaliation for an attack on a US military base in the region? Probably not,\" nuclear strategy specialist Vipin Narang tells the AP. And that's exactly the calculation that gives North Korea a small shot at \"winning\" in a nuclear conflict, challenging the assumption that launching a nuclear weapon would be automatic suicide for the country. If North Korea feels threatened to the point of using a nuclear weapon, a first target would likely be a US military base in Japan; North Korea would then use its long-range nukes to threaten the US mainland and avoid a retaliatory strike. Experts say this is Kim Jong Un's \"theory of victory\"\u2014one that President Trump may be attempting to combat with an unsuccessful version of the \"madman strategy.\" Here's what else you need to know about North Korea's most-recent missile launch: Tuesday's missile launch over Japan seems likely to result in even more sanctions against North Korea. But after UN sanctions Aug. 5 targeted millions of dollars in seafood, coal, iron ore, and more, is there anything left to sanction? CNN reports two options are oil and Chinese banks. After Tuesday's missile launch, Trump said \"all options are on the table.\" This was, all things considered, a \"measured\" response from the president, according to the Atlantic. It was an official statement instead of a tweet, didn't threaten \"fire and fury,\" and avoided calling Kim Jong Un a \"wack job.\" The Guardian reports on the scary morning had by residents of Japan, who were awoken around 6am Tuesday by a government missile warning on their phones. They were given less than 10 minutes to get to a shelter or sturdy building as sirens and special broadcasts blared. The missile test impacted US markets, with the Dow dropping more than 100 points Tuesday morning, Reuters reports. The stock market would recover by the afternoon as the threat passed. Korea expert Stephan Haggard tells the Washington Post that Tuesday was another example of how \"weirdly conservative\" Kim Jong Un is\u2014carrying out provocative actions with just enough restraint to avoid an actual response. For example, pointing the missile toward Japan, not Guam. Finally, Russia's deputy foreign minister blamed the US and South Korea for Tuesday's nuclear test and came out against further sanctions against North Korea, saying they haven't prevented missile tests in the past and won't in the future, Newsweek reports.",

The charges against him span from a May-to-July period of 1944 in which some 425,000 Hungarian Jews were sent to Auschwitz. Most were immediately killed. \"Someone said that 5,000 people were processed in 24 hours but I didn't verify this,\" he said. \"I didn't know.\" The 93-year-old's testimony came in response to questions from attorneys representing Auschwitz survivors who have joined the trial as co-plaintiffs, as allowed under German law.

Police have closed a stretch of State Route 374 and ordered residents of Cadyville, NY, to stay inside and keep their exterior lights on, residents tell WPTZ. In other developments: Timothy Vail was the last man to escape from a New York prison, according to the New York Daily News, and he says he hopes Matt and Sweat can avoid capture. He tells the Daily News that he hopes they \"stay out of sight and don't commit any new crimes.\" Vail, who raped and murdered a pregnant woman in 1988, injured himself while escaping from the Elmira Correctional Facility in 2003 and was recaptured within two days after he and a fellow fugitive stole a van. Police officers who've dealt with Matt say he is the most evil criminal they've encountered, and he was trouble from a very early age, the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle reports. The former chief of police in North Tonawanda, near where Matt grew up, says he's around the same age as the 48-year-old and that long before Matt's first arrest, he had a \"fearsome\" reputation and was known for terrorizing other kids on the school bus. An officer in Tonawanda tells the paper that in 1986\u201411 years before his arrest for a gruesome local murder\u2014Matt broke out of a correctional facility and was recaptured a few days later.

A history professor tells the Times that the first escapes happened just weeks after the prison opened. The reform-minded warden decided not to punish the two men after they were recaptured, the professor says, but it wasn't long before a new warden installed a dungeon for solitary confinement, where punishments included waterboarding.",

Lawyers for Albany's Nite Moves will appear before the state's highest court today to argue that it doesn't need to pay sales tax on admission fees or lap dances, reports the AP. The club claims the dances are exempt under part of the tax code covering \"live dramatic or musical arts performances\"\u2014and it has a cultural anthropologist as an expert witness. Before a lower court, the anthropologist testified that she had observed \"choreographic patterns of exotic dance\" at the club, noting that one dancer executed 61 moves in the course of three songs, the Wall Street Journal reports. The tax department, however, argued that a nude dancer is not \"engaged in a genuine choreographic dance performance when she removes her clothing.\" Whatever the court decides may not have much impact on other establishments, since Nite Moves only serves non-alcoholic drinks, putting it under a different part of the tax code than most other strip clubs.",

This alleged ability is apparently not a new one, per the report, as ISIS seized Deir ez-Zour, which is home to a passport office, last summer. \"Since more than 17 months [have] passed since Raqqa and Deir ez-Zour fell to ISIS, it is possible that individuals from Syria with passports \u2018issued\u2019 in these ISIS controlled cities or who had passport blanks, may have traveled to the US,\" per the report.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 If your short-term plan involves getting pregnant, your immediate plan should potentially be to lay off the potatoes. So suggests a National Institutes of Health study published Tuesday in the BMJ that found women who eat more potatoes before becoming pregnant may be more likely to develop gestational diabetes as compared to their spud-light counterparts. That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap. The researchers estimate that trading two servings of potatoes weekly for a substitute vegetable, legumes, or whole-grain food would reduce the risk of gestational diabetes\u2014which CBS reports affects as many as 8% of pregnancies\u2014by 9% to 12%. As for why women should care, Zhang tells the BBC that women with gestational diabetes can develop pre-eclampsia and hypertension, which \"can adversely affect the fetus\" and put the mother at higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. The team notes, however, that the study shows correlation, not causation, and says more research is needed. (One country has told its women not to get pregnant right now.)",

An Arizona auction house says it was contacted by a Sun City resident who wanted someone to take a look at a 1992 LA Lakers poster signed by Bryant. \"We ended up signing a contract to auction the contents of the estate, and that's when we found many of the paintings,\" among them one that Josh Levine of J. Levine Auction & Appraisal believed to be a Pollock. The Arizona Republic reports Levine was so intrigued by the potential Pollock that he spent more than $50,000 over 18 months in an attempt to establish it was done by the artist's hand. \"I'm brave enough to call it a Jackson Pollock and put my entire reputation on it,\" he says. Still, Levine acknowledges potential Pollocks have long been a source of art-world consternation; the Pollock-Krasner Foundation does not authenticate Pollock paintings. But in a press release, the auction house describes the painting's provenance as \"strong\": The man who owned it\u2014he had never heard of Pollock\u2014was given the gouache painting by his half-sister, who was a longtime friend of an art critic who knew Pollock. The auction house further explains forensic tests established \"the dating of the painting to the mid-twentieth century ... as no pigments or binding media introduced in the late 1950s and 1960s have been detected.\" The work, which measures 22.5 x 32 inches, will be auctioned June 20; Levine expects it will fetch $10 million to $15 million.

According to TMJ4, police told Diane Moyer to leave the restaurant after a customer complained about Jimmy, the 8-month-old kangaroo she had sitting in an infant car seat. She explained that the kangaroo is considered a therapy animal and that she has a doctor's note of approval, but she was still asked to leave by a police officer who told her a customer had said it wasn't appropriate or safe to have the kangaroo in the restaurant. Moyer, who lives on a 70-acre farm with Jimmy, four other kangaroos, and assorted other animals, tells the Daily Citizen that the marsupials are among the \"most loving, trustworthy animals that I have ever had\" and that authorities have fully inspected her farm to make sure it's suitable for kangaroos. She says she has taken Jimmy to that McDonald's many times before, as well as to the movies and her church, and nobody else has complained. \"I wish the person in McDonald's would have just come and talked to me instead,\" she says.

But an exhausting process of editing followed, with more than two dozen CIA officials weighing in on the copy over email\u2014and battling about the inclusion of al-Qaeda. Those opposed argued it should be removed because the intel was shaky (sourced from intercepted phone calls) and over fears it could alert al-Qaeda members to the fact that they were being watched. The opponents won out, though the term \"extremists\" remained; the FBI agreed with the call. It also contained this line: \"The demonstrations in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the US Embassy in Cairo.\" On Sept. 15, the CIA station chief in Tripoli began to voice his concern with the assertions that the attack was both spontaneous and that demonstrations were occurring.

Many of the people who have racked up nearly 3 million views of the video that shows Detective Jeff Payne arresting University of Utah Hospital nurse Alex Wubbels would likely agree. Gill on Friday called for a criminal investigation into the encounter, in which Payne handcuffed a screaming Wubbels after she refused to permit a blood draw from an unconscious patient\u2014as she was right to do, according to law, because Payne had neither a warrant nor the consent of the patient, who was not under arrest. The Salt Lake Tribune reports Payne was put on administrative leave Friday afternoon, along with a second unnamed officer connected to the July 26 incident. More: Mayor Jackie Biskupski and Chief Mike Brown both called Wubbels to apologize. Per the city, the Unified Police Department will begin a criminal probe into the matter, and an internal affairs investigation will be conduced as well. The Tribune also offers more background on the patient in question: William Gray, a 43-year-old who was driving a semi when a 26-year-old who was trying to evade the Utah Highway Patrol crashed into Gray head-on. That driver was killed, and a police official explains it's typical to get blood draws of those involved in fatal crashes, even if they aren't suspected of wrongdoing. The AP cites Payne's police report, in which he wrote he was trying to avoid a \"scene\" by taking Wubbels outside and that this his boss told him to arrest her if she didn't cooperate with the draw. Wubbels' attorney says the nurse was left in a hot police car for 20 minutes before the detective realized the hospital had already drawn the patient's blood as part of treatment. The Tribune notes that while the video may suggest Payne was demanding Wubbels draw Gray's blood, Payne is actually one of a handful of officers certified to draw blood in accident cases, and was looking to draw the blood himself.",

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Feeling upbeat? Enough of that: Planet Earth is undergoing a sixth mass extinction that will likely annihilate the human race unless we can curb the trend, scientists say. According to a new paper, the current rate of species extinction outpaces the natural rate far more than anyone knew, NBC News reports. The analysis \"employed better knowledge\" of Earth's natural extinction rate, the Guardian reports, upping the number from one extinction per million species annually to two extinctions. It then compared that to a current extinction rate that study authors consider conservative. Presto, they got a rate since 1900 that's eight to 100 times worse than the natural one. \"We were very surprised to see how bad it is,\" says study leader Gerardo Ceballos. \"This is very depressing.\" \"If it is allowed to continue, life would take millions of years to recover, and our species itself would disappear early on,\" says Ceballos. But nations can reverse the crisis\u2014which has been linked to deforestation, industrialization, and other human factors\u2014by conserving threatened species and lowering pressures on their populations, the paper says. So far critics seem to buy the paper's basic math but doubt that species extinction will continue at this high rate for centuries. \"It is likely the problem will decline rapidly because most countries will be rich and care much for the natural world,\" writes one environmentalist. Earth has seen five other mass extinctions, including one 443 million years ago that killed off 83% of sea life, and the most recent, which wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago, the Telegraph notes.",

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It passed in the wee hours, and by a wee margin: The Senate passed the biggest tax overhaul in more than 30 years Saturday morning 51-49. Tennessee's Sen. Bob Corker was the only Republican to side against the bill. With the House having passed its bill in November, Congress is just a few steps away from getting something on President Trump's desk. He tweeted in part, \"Look forward to signing a final bill before Christmas!\" Politico reports the final hours before the vote were filled with \"horse trading\" and some ridicule from Democrats: Minority Whip Dick Durbin tweeted a photo showing a page of the bill with semi-legible handwriting scrawled in the margin, saying, \"Trying to review the #GOPTaxScam but they are making hand-written changes to brand new text as we speak \u2013 can anyone else read this?\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer swung at Republicans for releasing a revamped 479-page bill that senators didn't have time to review. GOP Sen. Ron Johnson's take, per the AP: \"You really don't read this kind of legislation.\" Among the numerous last-minute amendments that were debated: A controversial provision by GOP Sen. Pat Toomey that would have given Michigan's conservative Hillsdale College a pass on a new tax on university endowments was axed. Politico reports the House will on Monday formally assemble the conference committee that will work to get the House and Senate measures to jibe; the Senate hasn't commented on a formal conference yet. The Wall Street Journal offers a chart that illustrates key differences between the two bills.",

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The co-founder of an online music streaming service has mysteriously died just months after the company was forced to shut down, the Gainesville Sun reports. Josh Greenberg, who helped start Grooveshark in 2006 and inspired fellow startup pioneers, was found dead by his girlfriend last night in Gainesville, Fla. His mother, Lori Greenberg, told police the 28-year-old wasn't sick and says their initial investigation found no evidence of drugs. \"It looked like he was sleeping,\" she says. Police added on Twitter, \"No evidence of foul play or suicide.\" Lori says he wasn't even depressed after record companies sued Grooveshark, forcing it to shutter and settle on April 30. Josh \"was excited about potential new things that he was going to start,\" Lori says. Variety notes that Escape Media Group, Grooveshark's parent company, agreed it would pay $75 million if Grooveshark violated the settlement. But Josh was known for more than Grooveshark, which had 145 workers and up to 40 million monthly users at its peak. He also mentored computer programmers and pioneers in Gainesville, offering guidance through programs like Grooveshark University and Summer with the Sharks internships. Now accolades are pouring in, including words from a colleague who describes Greenberg's death as \"terrible news\": \"With Josh it always felt like sitting in the presence of a much deeper, loving intelligence,\" blogs Ben Erez at Viabilify. \"It felt like witnessing true leadership.\" An autopsy today found no cause of death, Lori tells the Sun, and toxicology results should arrive within two to three months.",

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Think Wendy Davis' 10-hour filibuster was impressive? That was nothing compared to what dozens of lawmakers in South Korea just accomplished in the country's first filibuster in 47 years. For 192 hours and 25 minutes\u2014or almost nine days\u2014beginning Feb. 23, opposition Members of Parliament rambled on in an attempt to block an anti-terror bill proposed by a member of the governing party, report the BBC and Korea Times. The goal was to get to the end of the parliamentary session on March 10, but the filibuster came to a close Wednesday after attacks by the country's leaders. The bill passed hours later. At least the lawmakers still have something to show for their efforts: They smashed the world record for filibustering set in 2011 when Canadian lawmakers delayed proceedings for 57 hours. The last speaker alone spoke for 12 hours and 31 minutes to claim the record for longest individual filibuster in South Korea. Speakers wore running shoes, thumbed through huge stacks of documents, read academic articles and online comments on privacy infringement in their entirety, and recited sections of George Orwell's 1984, per Yonhap News. It was unsurprising, then, that the parliament chair was caught sleeping. The lawmakers argued the anti-terror bill\u2014allowing for the collection of data, including phone records, on people considered security risks\u2014would violate privacy rights, but President Park Geun-hye said the filibuster was \"nothing more than a dereliction of duty.\" The public was also peeved that the stunt held up bills regarding North Korean human rights and an upcoming election.",

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It looks like the hackers that hit Target had lots of other, well, targets. The Department of Homeland Security recently sent retailers and financial service companies a secret memo warning that the Target hit appeared to be part of a larger international campaign, the Wall Street Journal reports, an insight gleaned with the help of Dallas cybersecurity firm iSight Partners. Yesterday, iSight released its own report, saying that a virus it's calling KAPTOXA \"has potentially infected a large number of retail information systems\"\u2014and noting that the \"intrusion operators displayed innovation and a high degree of skill,\" particularly in terms of the \"operational sophistication\" of the hack. The Journal shares this feature by way of example: The virus focused on stealing data during the peak hours of 10am and 5pm; the data was housed in a Target server that the hackers later accessed. The virus attacks point-of-sale systems in a way that is \"new to eCrime,\" subverting traditional efforts to protect consumer data, the report warns, according to NBC. Parts of the code, which is impervious to all known antivirus software, have been online since last spring. It's partly in Russian, which US officials think may indicate a link to organized crime in the former Soviet Union. The finding follows reports of similar breaches at Neiman Marcus. That breach had gone unnoticed since July, the New York Times reports today; Neiman's system was only fully secured Sunday.",
