Meanwhile, NATO is expected to formally announce today that it will end its mission in Libya at the end of the month, notes the Telegraph. \"Sirte has been liberated. There are no Gaddafi forces any more,\" a commander tells Reuters. \"We are now chasing his fighters who are trying to run away.\" Earlier, a spokesman for Libya's National Transitional council said that 68 vehicles with at least eight fighters had crossed the Libyan borders to Mali and Gadhaafi was hiding in the southern desert, hoping to destabilize the new government.",

The Guardian has a photo that purports to depict a bloody Gadhafi here (Warning: it's graphic). The strike also reportedly killed the head of Gadhafi's armed forces, Abu Bakr Younus Jabr. Earlier, AP reporters watched as rebels fought a 90-minute battle to rout pro-Gadhafi fighters from their remaining neighborhoods in Sirte, apparently ending the last major battle of the Libyan war. \"Sirte has been liberated. There are no Gadhafi forces anymore,\" an NTC colonel said. \"We are now chasing his fighters who are trying to run away.\" Not all Gadhafi forces are running through; the Telegraph says there are reports of some taking off their uniforms and firing indiscriminately on civilians.

In fact, \"it may be good for you.\" They first found the virus in blood samples from two volunteers, part of a study of 46, who received blood transfusions to treat hemophilia between 1974 and 1980. The virus only appeared after transfusions, but both patients cleared it and showed no sign of disease. Two more cases were found among 106 who'd received plasma, per mBio; both cleared the virus, though one was infected for five years. Even if the virus is harmful, researchers say there's no need to panic. \"This is not SARS. This is not MERS. This is not HIV,\" says an expert. Whereas blood transfusions were once performed solely with human blood products, they now use genetically engineered products. Plus, blood is screened more carefully and stricter policies better control who donates blood compared to 25 years ago. \"Does it cause trouble that would justify any response with blood safety?

And so the CD (reportedly signed by Trump) ended up in Pompeo's luggage, along with a letter to Kim. Gizmodo, which calls \"Rocket Man\" a \"damn good song,\" notes Trump seems fixated on the 1972 hit, which became a staple of sorts at his rallies while he was campaigning for the presidency. On Thursday, Trump once again referenced the British superstar, per Billboard, noting at a rally in Montana that \"I've broken more Elton John [attendance] records, and I don't have a musical instrument. \u2026 This is my only musical instrument\u2014the mouth\u2014and hopefully the brain is attached to the mouth. The brain is so much more important.\"",

This was a government-funded policy of genocide.\" Indeed, as the Washington Post reports, Minneapolis is home to a sizable Native American presence, perhaps contributing to the size of the demonstration.

Should Trump's favorite be eliminated, it \"will call into question the influence of Trump's support in a reliably Republican state,\" per Politico.

It was discovered in 1845 by Europeans who shot the \"large rats\" for sport, and the last known sighting in 2009 by a professional fisherman, reports the Guardian. But after a 2014 study found no sign of the rodent, researchers decided to conduct the most extensive survey possible in the hope of conserving the species. That survey, using traps, cameras, and searches, \"produced no records of the species, confirming that the only known population of this rodent is now extinct,\" says the report, published in the journal Zootaxa. The key factor behind the extinction was \"almost certainly\" ocean inundation of the low-lying cay, likely on several occasions, over the last decade, which resulted in dramatic habitat loss. Available data on sea-level rise and weather events in the Torres Strait region \"point to human-induced climate change being the root cause of the loss\" and \"probably represents the first documented mammalian extinction due solely (or primarily) to anthropogenic climate change.\" Melomys rubicola, which can grow up to a foot in length, were first discovered on Bramble Cay in the 1970s and are believed to have survived until at least the 1980s, when they were hunted to the point of extinction. They were also known to eat green turtles, terns, and delta boobies, but were thought to be inbred because they ate only the plant Portulaca oleracea.

The cholesterol, which is still preserved in the fossils, is a hallmark of animal life. According to the study, Dickinsonia is the oldest animal ever discovered, beating out Kimberella, an early mollusk-like animal, and the worm-like Helminthoidichnites, which were around the same age. \"Scientists have been fighting for more than 75 years over what Dickinsonia and other bizarre fossils of the Ediacaran Biota were.

That conclusion comes thanks to fat, reports Phys.org. Ilya Bobrovskiy of Australian National University discovered a Dickinsonia fossil in 300-foot-high cliffs along the White Sea in northwest Russia, in a place so remote she reached it via helicopter.

Eva Kor, 81, was 10 years old when she and her twin sister, Miriam, were taken to the Auschwitz-Birkenau complex and subjected to gruesome experiments carried out by Nazi doctor Josef Mengele. \"We were huddled in our filthy bunk beds, crawling with lice and rats, we were starved for food, starved for human kindness, and starved for the love of the mothers and fathers we once had,\" she said. Her parents and two older sisters were whisked to the gas chambers, where they were used in Mengele's experiments. \"All I remember is her arms stretched out in despair as she was pulled away. I never even got to say goodbye,\" she told the AP before addressing the court. \"I share morally in the guilt but whether I am guilty under criminal law, you will have to decide.\" Former Nazi SS guard Oskar Groening, 93, is charged with being an accessory to the murder of at least 300,000 Jews between May and July 1944, the BBC reports. On Tuesday, he said he asked for forgiveness\u2014\"How do you feel about my forgiving you and all the Nazis for what was done to me?\" That was the question posed by Eva Kor. Groening was impassive as she answered, \"I don't forgive. I forgive.\"",

Oskar Groening told the Lueneburg state court today during the third day of his trial, the dpa news agency reported. Groening earlier described a veritable traffic jam of trains arriving at the Nazi death camp, reports the BBC. \"For the sake of order we waited until train one was entirely processed and finished,\" Groening testified; that processing involved marching most passengers directly into the gas chambers. The charges against him span from a May-to-July period of 1944 in which some 425,000 Hungarian Jews were sent to Auschwitz. Most were immediately killed. \"Someone said that 5,000 people were processed in 24 hours but I didn't verify this,\" he said. \"I didn't know.\" The 93-year-old's testimony came in response to questions from attorneys representing Auschwitz survivors who have joined the trial as co-plaintiffs, as allowed under German law. Yesterday saw testimony from Eva Kor, now 81, who arrived at Auschwitz as a 10-year-old. As a twin, she was experimented on by Dr. Josef Mengele, reports NBC News. \"On alternate days\u2014Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays\u2014[she and sister Miriam] were brought to a lab. ... They took blood from my left arm and gave me at least five injections into my right arm. Those were the deadly ones.\" NBC reports Groening was expressionless throughout her testimony. He faces three to 15 years in prison if found guilty.",

Sources say investigators have found tracks in the woods near the prison that lead back to a gas station on State Route 374 in Cadyville, NY, where a Subway restaurant is located. A source tells CNN that K-9 units picked up on the men's scents at the gas station, and Clinton County District Attorney Andrew Wylie says he believes the men may have been trying to find food in a trash bin. A highway was closed in the area last night, and residents were told to stay in their homes and lock their doors, reports the New York Times, which notes that dozens of inmates have escaped from the state's oldest and most remote prison since it opened in 1845. The search effort, which has involved hundreds of officers looking \"behind every tree, under every rock and inside every structure,\" has shifted toward Vermont, which Gov. Andrew Cuomo says has \"information that would suggest (that state) was discussed as a possible location.\" But authorities say they don't have. Meanwhile, one of the inmates who helped escape from the same prison in 2003 has some advice for the escaped convicts. \"I hope they stay out of sight and don\u2019t commit any new crimes.

In other developments: Timothy Vail was the last man to escape from a New York prison, according to the New York Daily News, and he says he hopes Matt and Sweat can avoid capture. He tells the Daily News that he hopes they \"stay out of sight and don't commit any new crimes.\" Vail, who raped and murdered a pregnant woman in 1988, injured himself while escaping from the Elmira Correctional Facility in 2003 and was recaptured within two days after he and a fellow fugitive stole a van. Police officers who've dealt with Matt say he is the most evil criminal they've encountered, and he was trouble from a very early age, the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle reports. The former chief of police in North Tonawanda, near where Matt grew up, says he's around the same age as the 48-year-old and that long before Matt's first arrest, he had a \"fearsome\" reputation and was known for terrorizing other kids on the school bus. An officer in Tonawanda tells the paper that in 1986\u201411 years before his arrest for a gruesome local murder\u2014Matt broke out of a correctional facility and was recaptured a few days later. Early reports described the pair as among the first to escape in the Clinton Correctional Facility's long history, but dozens of men have made it out in various ways since the forbidding Dannemora, NY, institution opened in 1845, the New York Times reports. In 1860, a fraudster known as the \"Gay Deceiver\" put on civilian clothes, strolled out the gate, and wasn't recaptured for a year. A history professor tells the Times that the first escapes happened just weeks after the prison opened.

Researchers at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development at Harvard and the National Institutes of Health looked at data from more than 15,000 women who had no history of illness before pregnancy and had not had gestational diabetes before. Every four years, the women filled out a questionnaire about the kinds of foods they had eaten in the previous year, ranging from \"never\" to \"six or more times a day,\" and were asked if they'd consumed baked, boiled, mashed, or chips.

Previous research has shown a link between diabetes and a high glycemic index, but this is the first study to show an association between potato consumption before pregnant and the risk of the condition, which can lead to diabetes during pregnancy. \"Our findings are biologically plausible, though the detailed underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated,\" the lead researcher tells CBS News.",

A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap. The researchers estimate that trading two servings of potatoes weekly for a substitute vegetable, legumes, or whole-grain food would reduce the risk of gestational diabetes\u2014which CBS reports affects as many as 8% of pregnancies\u2014by 9% to 12%. As for why women should care, Zhang tells the BBC that women with gestational diabetes can develop pre-eclampsia and hypertension, which \"can adversely affect the fetus\" and put the mother at higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. The team notes, however, that the study shows correlation, not causation, and says more research is needed. (One country has told its women not to get pregnant right now.)",

But while the European plan is legally binding, Walmart's is voluntary, and experts say such plans have a poor record for delivering results. \"Without the legally binding contract that the European retailers have signed, it's just putting lipstick on a pig,\" a sociology professor who has been a vocal critic of sweatshops tells the Wall Street Journal. The Gap, meanwhile, says it won't sign the European plan unless language is removed that it fears could make it liable in US courts for safety failures at Bangladesh factories. The only American firm to have signed the plan so far is PVH, the parent company of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger.",

Gill on Friday called for a criminal investigation into the encounter, in which Payne handcuffed a screaming Wubbels after she refused to permit a blood draw from an unconscious patient\u2014as she was right to do, according to law, because Payne had neither a warrant nor the consent of the patient, who was not under arrest. The Salt Lake Tribune reports Payne was put on administrative leave Friday afternoon, along with a second unnamed officer connected to the July 26 incident. More: Mayor Jackie Biskupski and Chief Mike Brown both called Wubbels to apologize. Per the city, the Unified Police Department will begin a criminal probe into the matter, and an internal affairs investigation will be conduced as well. The Tribune also offers more background on the patient in question: William Gray, a 43-year-old who was driving a semi when a 26-year-old who was trying to evade the Utah Highway Patrol crashed into Gray head-on. That driver was killed, and a police official explains it's typical to get blood draws of those involved in fatal crashes, even if they aren't suspected of wrongdoing. The AP cites Payne's police report, in which he wrote he was trying to avoid a \"scene\" by taking Wubbels outside and that this his boss told him to arrest her if she didn't cooperate with the draw. Wubbels' attorney says the nurse was left in a hot police car for 20 minutes before the detective realized the hospital had already drawn the patient's blood as part of treatment. The Tribune notes that while the video may suggest Payne was demanding Wubbels draw Gray's blood, Payne is actually one of a handful of officers certified to draw blood in accident cases, and was looking to draw the blood himself.",

But while those five extinctions usually saw two species of mammals die out every 10,000 years, the current rate is 114 times that, according to a study published Friday in Science Advances. \"We were very surprised to see how bad it is,\" study co-author Gerardo Ceballos of the National Autonomous University of Mexico tells the Guardian. \"This is very depressing because we used the most conservative rates, and even then they are much higher than the normal extinction rate, really indicating we are having a massive loss of the species.\" The rate of extinction for species in the 20th century was up to 100 times higher than it would have been without man, reports the New York Times. \"There are examples of species all over the world that are essentially the walking dead,\" says Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University, one of the study's co-authors. \"Avoiding a true sixth extinction will require rapid, greatly intensified efforts to conserve already threatened species, and to alleviate pressures on their populations\u2014exploitation for economic gain and climate change.\"",

Enough of that: Planet Earth is undergoing a sixth mass extinction that will likely annihilate the human race unless we can curb the trend, scientists say. According to a new paper, the current rate of species extinction outpaces the natural rate far more than anyone knew, NBC News reports. The analysis \"employed better knowledge\" of Earth's natural extinction rate, the Guardian reports, upping the number from one extinction per million species annually to two extinctions. It then compared that to a current extinction rate that study authors consider conservative. Presto, they got a rate since 1900 that's eight to 100 times worse than the natural one. \"We were very surprised to see how bad it is,\" says study leader Gerardo Ceballos. \"This is very depressing.\" \"If it is allowed to continue, life would take millions of years to recover, and our species itself would disappear early on,\" says Ceballos. But nations can reverse the crisis\u2014which has been linked to deforestation, industrialization, and other human factors\u2014by conserving threatened species and lowering pressures on their populations, the paper says. So far critics seem to buy the paper's basic math but doubt that species extinction will continue at this high rate for centuries. \"It is likely the problem will decline rapidly because most countries will be rich and care much for the natural world,\" writes one environmentalist. Earth has seen five other mass extinctions, including one 443 million years ago that killed off 83% of sea life, and the most recent, which wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago, the Telegraph notes.",

According to the New York Times, 39 opposition lawmakers spoke for 192 hours and 25 minutes over the course of the filibuster to block a vote on the bill.
