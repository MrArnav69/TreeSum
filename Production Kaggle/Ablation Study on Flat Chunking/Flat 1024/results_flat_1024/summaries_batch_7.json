Russian scientist Igor Ashurbeyli has announced plans to create a country called Asgardia, named for the city in the skies ruled by Norse god Odin. Asgardia will launch its own satellite in 2017 and dedicate itself to opening up access to space, protecting Earth from asteroids and space junk, and fostering world peace, according to a press release. \"Asgardia is also unique from a philosophical aspect\u2014to serve entire humanity and each and everyone, regardless of his or her personal welfare and the prosperity of the country where they happened to be born,\" as well as \"a state-of-the-art protective shield for all humankind from cosmic, manmade, and natural threats to life on Earth,\" AsHURbeyli says. A website for Asgardia has been launched, and people can register to become a citizen. Once 100,000 people do, Asgardia is eligible to apply to the United Nations for official nation status, the Independent reports. \"It will offer an independent platform free from the constraint of a land-based country's laws,\" the project website says, adding that Asgardia \"will become a place it in orbit which is truly 'no man's land.' Physically the citizens of that nation state will be on Earth; they will be living in different countries on Earth.

There's no terra firma for Asgardian citizens to travel to: The Guardian reports Asgardia appears to \"consist of a single satellite,\" planned to be launched by the project next year. Ashurbeyli explains \"physically the citizens of that nation state will be on Earth,\" meaning they'll be a citizen of their own country and Asgardia simultaneously. CNET frames Asgardia as a \"scientific, legal, and technological experiment,\" with Ashurbeyli planning to petition the UN for the status of state once 100,000 people have applied to be citizens on the Asgardia website, which launched Wednesday. Among the project's ambitious goals: to create a state-of-the-art protective shield to keep space debris and asteroids from reaching Earth's surface. Space regulation is another focus: Since the late 1960s, the Outer Space Treaty has assigned liability for objects sent into space on the nation launching them. Asgardia could in theory \"do an end-run around government regulations that are a key part of making the treaty work by forming a new government accountable to nobody but the space enthusiasts that formed it,\" observes CNET.

Here's what you need to know: The House has already passed a bill to fund the government through Dec. 15, and John Boehner is pushing for a delay in the new health care law for a year and a repeal of the medical device tax that is part of it, reports the Wall Street Journal. Senate Democrats have said they won't accept any changes to the health law, and President Obama has said he'll veto any bill that includes such a measure. But the Journal notes that Republicans believe they have the votes in the Senate to get rid of the tax. If that happens, the Senate could pass a short-term spending bill for a week or so, and then pressure both parties to reach a deal in the coming days. Harry Reid has been pushing hard for a deal, but Politico reports that he privately urged Obama not to hold a meeting with the four congressional leaders ahead of the deadline. Washington, DC, is home to the largest concentration of federal workers in the nation, and if the government shuts down tonight\u2014as expected\u2014that could cost the region $200 million a day, and more than 700,000 jobs, the Washington Post reports. \"This is serious,\" says the director of George Mason University's Center for Regional Analysis. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Washington is braced for the first government shutdown in 17 years, which will happen at midnight tonight unless lawmakers manage to break the deadlock over funding and hammer out a deal. Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House\u2014but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight\u2014which appears to be the likeliest scenario\u2014the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month\u2014and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon\u2014but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day\u2014and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University\u2019s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

He first went to Kenya from the US in the 1970s when there was a surge in the number of elephants being killed for their ivory.

Bradley Martin, identifiable by a colorful handkerchief he often had peeking out of his jacket pocket, was a major figure within the wildlife conservation movement who'd risen to prominence by going undercover, usually posing as a buyer, to expose the illegal market for ivory and rhino horn. A former UN special envoy for rhino conservation, Bradley Martin began his efforts in earnest in the 1970s, when the number of elephants being slaughtered for their ivory spiked. That's when he left the US for Kenya, and his work helped put an end to the sales of rhino horn and ivory in China. His travels also took him to Vietnam and Laos, where last year he and another researcher revealed the latter country's ivory trade was the fastest growing in the world. Their work there involved the dangerous ploy of pretending they were buyers and staying in a casino frequented by organized-crime members and traffickers, all so they could find out what the going price for ivory was.

Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett says he has asked the Department of Justice to open an investigation into the shooting. \"This is a very difficult time for the city of Milwaukee,\" Barrett says. \"There's a lot of work that needs to be done to make sure that this does not spread to other parts of the city.\" \"We'll be sharing information with the community so they are aware of what's going on and understand that things will be moving forward,\" says Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr., who requested the Guard. \"I'm not going to get caught like Ferguson and Baltimore.\" The police union called the violence a \"terrorist-like\" act and said the people who set fire to buildings and fired weapons \"thugs\" and \"terrorists.\" Four police officers were injured and 17 people were arrested in the unrest.",

Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn says the officer who shot 23-year-old Sylville K. Smith is also black, and that officer is now staying with relatives out of town amid concerns for his safety, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports. Flynn says Smith had a lengthy criminal record and was shot after fleeing a traffic stop on foot Saturday afternoon. The chief says Smith had a gun that he didn't drop when he was ordered to and, per body camera footage, \"the individual did turn toward the officer with the firearm in his hand. You can't tell when the officer discharges his firearm.\" Flynn says the officer \"certainly appeared to be within lawful bounds.\" Officials earlier said Smith was carrying a stolen handgun with 23 rounds of ammunition, Reuters reports. Before protests turned violent Sunday night, several of his sisters addressed a peaceful vigil. \"My brother was no felon,\" said Kimberly Neal. \"My brother was running for his life. He was shot in his back.\" Sherelle Smith, another sister, condemned the Saturday night violence that left businesses burned and four police officers injured, CNN reports. The National Guard was activated but not deployed during Sunday night's protest. Police say the person shot during Sunday's unrest is an 18-year-old man who was rushed to a hospital with serious injuries. His connection to the protests is unclear.",

Here's what you need to know about Ebola, the current outbreak, and why it's so deadly: Ebola is rare and very deadly. Since the first outbreak in 1976, Ebola viruses have infected roughly 2,400 people and killed about one-third of them. Symptoms can come on very quickly and kill fast: \"Ebola is more inimical to humans than perhaps any known virus on Earth, except rabies and HIV-1. And it does its damage much faster than either.\" Why this particular outbreak so deadly? First, this outbreak concerns the most deadly of the five Ebola viruses\u2014the Zaire ebolavirus, which has killed 79% of those it has infected. (The virus is called that after the formerly named Zaire, which, along with Sudan, experienced the first Ebola outbreak back in 1976.)

That far exceeds the 280 killed when the disease debuted in 1976. \"This epidemic is out of control,\" a Doctors Without Borders official said this week, according to the Guardian. This outbreak is proving especially deadly because it involves the most devastating of the five Ebola viruses; Zaire ebolavirus kills 79% of those infected, Vox explains. It's also the first major outbreak to hit West Africa, and workers there aren't sure how to deal with it\u2014many hospitals, for example, are releasing infected patients. Among the general populace, education is even worse. In Sierra Leone, for instance, young people have burned drugs and supplies, believing that it was the medicine killing the patients.

The law, which takes effect Jan. 1, will make it harder for doctors to refuse requests from mentally ill patients. \"If I want to end my life, all of a sudden, I can\u2019t think straight anymore? That\u2019s something strange,\" she says. But the law's opponents say mentally ill people shouldn't be forced to end their lives. \"I think if the doctors had tried to help her more or proposed other things, she might have felt there was another solution,\" says the sister of a woman who was mentally ill. Belgium is one of only two countries in the world where euthanasia is legal for people with psychiatric illnesses, and the family of Tine Nys is now accusing three doctors of \"poisoning\" her and helping her end her life, the AP reports. \"She knew that if she wasn\u2019t diagnosed with autism or Asperger\u2019s that she would not have a chance (of being euthanized),\" says her sister.",

Three doctors from East Flanders are being investigated on suspicion of having \"poisoned\" Tine Nys in 2010. The 38-year-old had been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome two months before she died in an apparently legal killing by a doctor. Sophie Nys, one of Tine's sisters, told the AP of \"irregularities\" in the process: that the doctor who performed the euthanasia asked her parents to hold the needle in place while he administered the fatal injection, among other fumbling efforts. Afterward, the doctor asked the family to use a stethoscope to confirm that Tine's heart had stopped. Last year, the AP reported that after Nys' family filed a criminal complaint, her doctors attempted to block the investigation. \"We must try to stop these people,\" wrote Dr. Lieve Thienpont, the psychiatrist who approved Nys' request to die\u2014and one of the doctors now facing charges. \"It is a seriously dysfunctional, wounded, traumatized family with very little empathy and respect for others.\" Nys also alleged that her sister's longtime psychiatrist wouldn't give Tine the OK, and that Thienpoint did so after as few as two or three sessions with her. Belgium is one of two countries, along with the Netherlands, where euthanasia of people for psychiatric reasons\u2014including depression, personality disorder and Asperger's\u2014is allowed if they can prove they have \"unbearable and untreatable\" suffering.",

Japan finally has an estimate on how much radiation has been released: The level is an indication of the total radioactive materials emitted. Data has revealed that the cumulative amount of radioactive particles released into the atmosphere had reached levels that apply to a Level 7 incident, reports the AP. So what is that estimate? According to two estimates, the equivalent of about 500,000 terabecquerels of radiation from iodine-131 has been released. The Level 7 threshold is \"several tens of thousands of terabecquerels.\" But all 7s are not created alike: The Wall Street Journal notes that officials were careful to say this this is still not a Chernobyl-size disaster. \"The amount of released radiation is about a tenth of Chernobyl\"\u2014about 5.2 million terabecquerels\u2014said a rep for Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency. But it could still top Chernobyl in one regard: TEPCO today warned that the plant continues to release radioactive materials, and that the total levels emitted could eventually top those released by Chernobyl. Level 7 also indicates widespread effects on the environment and health: The Telegraph noted that Japan's safety commission now says radiation in excess of the amount considered safe for humans during an entire year has been found as far as 37 miles from the plant; the evacuation zone is only 18 miles. Is there another big one we haven't been talking about? Sort of. Besides Chernobyl, Time notes that a 1957 accident in Kyshtym, Russia, was the only one that's come close to being a 7; it was a 6.

Austrian researchers found that people yawn more in summer than winter when the temperature is around 20 degrees Fahrenheit, Science Daily reports. Yawning is believed to deliver a fresh supply of oxygen to the brain, but previous studies haven't been able to show an increase in blood oxygen levels after yawning. The new study compared the results of a similar study in Arizona, which is arid, to Vienna, Austria, where the air is a lot cooler. Researchers found that contagious yawning\u2014in which people yawn while others do the same\u2014dropped when temperatures were around 37 degrees Fahrenheit in Arizona's summer and around freezing in Vienna's winter. \"While most research on contagious yawning emphasizes the influence of interpersonal and emotional-cognitive variables on its expression, this report adds to accumulating research suggesting that the underlying mechanism for yawning, both spontaneous and contagious forms, is involved in regulating brain temperature,\" the researchers write. \"In turn, the cooling of the brain functions to improve arousal and mental efficiency. The spreading of this behavior via contagious yawning could therefore function to enhance overall group vigilance.\"",

Previous research has indicated that we yawn after our body temperatures rise. The study found that people's age, sex, and previous night's sleep, on the other hand, didn't have much of an effect on our yawning patterns.

Biophysicist Daniel Perlman at Brandeis University, an inventor with more than 100 patents under his probably well-designed belt, says he's solved the age-old problem by etching a small groove into the bottle itself, per Phys.org. (You can see a demonstration via this video.) To arrive at his solution, Perlman studied slow-mo videos of wine being poured, then calculated precisely how large of an edge would be required to catch the offending drip. The answer: 2mm wide, 1mm deep. Gizmos already are on the market to stop the spills, while sommeliers might use a napkin to deftly wipe the bottle after a pour, but Perlman wanted to simplify things. \"I wanted to change the wine bottle itself,\" thus avoiding the need for an accessory, he says. Bloggers sound intrigued. The drip issue is a \"pretty obvious\" flaw that has been allowed to linger for as long as wine bottles have been made, complains a post at BGR. Another at Food & Wine notes that an industry-wide fix would likely raise manufacturing costs. \"But innovation has swept through the beverage industry before\u2014remember when not all cans were wide-mouths?\u2014so maybe a drip-free future is within our reach.\" (How does neon-blue wine sound?)",

It was once home to bits of forest, the scientists found using offshore plant DNA. In other words, as the International Business Times has it, \"Greenland really was green.\" The Greenland Ice Sheet that's there now, however, has been remarkably durable: The findings imply that it made it through a strong period of warming some 130,000 years ago. \"It's unlikely the ice sheet has disappeared for significant periods of time in the last three million years, at least at this one pinprick on this big island,\" Bierman says. \"Now human activity may spell the end of it.\" (What else lies under Greenland's ice?
