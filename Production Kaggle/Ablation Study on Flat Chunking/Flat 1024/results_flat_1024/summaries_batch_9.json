White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday that the White House had \"reviewed whether there was a legal issue\" and determined there was no basis for criminal charges. \"Just because you're not going to charge him with the Logan Act, there's certainly nothing to preclude you from going forward under 1001,\" former federal prosecutor Peter Zeidenberg tells the Times. The Logan Act prohibits US citizens from engaging in negotiations with foreign governments, and Flynn has admitted \"inadvertently\" giving \"incomplete information\" to Vice President-elect Mike Pence about his talks with Sergei Kislyak. According to the Washington Post, the FBI interviewed Flynn within days of Trump's inauguration and he told the FBI he hadn't discussed sanctions with the ambassador. But the Justice Department warned the Trump administration two weeks ago that Flynn had misled Pence, but the vice president didn't learn of the warning until two weeks later, administration officials say. Rush Limbaugh blamed the media Tuesday for Flynn's \"political assassination.\"",

Pence spokesman Marc Lotter tells the Washington Post that the vice president \"became aware of incomplete information\" on Feb. 9 following a Post story on the issue. The White House, however, says Trump and other top administration officials were briefed on the Justice Department's concerns about Flynn at least two weeks earlier. \"It's not that he was being left out. It was a legal review,\" an administration source tells CNN. In other developments: The FBI interviewed Flynn in late January after it warned the Trump administration that he could be blackmailed, the New York Times reports. If authorities determine that he lied during that interview, he could face felony charges. In an interview with the Daily Caller hours before his resignation, Flynn insisted there were \"no lines crossed\" in his conversation with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. \"It wasn't about sanctions. It was about the 35 guys who were thrown out,\" Flynn said, referring to former President Obama's expulsion of Russian diplomats in December. \"It was basically, 'Look, I know this happened. We'll review everything.' I never said anything such as, 'We're going to review sanctions,' or anything like that.\" Legal experts tell Politico that Flynn faces a real risk of prosecution if he wasn't truthful with the FBI, and claiming to have forgotten parts of the conversation probably won't work. Lawyer Mark Zaid says a puzzling aspect of the case is that, as a former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Flynn must have known that conversations with ambassadors from countries like Russia would be under surveillance. Republican senators are among those calling for a full investigation of the Flynn affair, but he still has his defenders, including Rush Limbaugh. On Tuesday, the radio host described pressure on Flynn as a \"political assassination\" by the media, the Hill reports. \"They think they have blood in the water, they've got a scalp, and they think they can get another and then another and then another and then another until finally they get Trump,\" he said.

It is too late for central Sulawesi, where walls of water up to 20 feet high and a magnitude 7.5 earthquake killed at least 832 people in Palu and Donggala, tragically highlighting the weaknesses of the existing warning system and low public awareness about how to respond to warnings. \"To me this is a tragedy for science, even more so a Tragedy for the Indonesian people as the residents of Sulawesi are discovering right now,\" says Louise Comfort, a University of Pittsburgh expert in disaster management.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The tsunami that killed hundreds, possibly thousands of people after an earthquake in Indonesia on Friday was much bigger and more devastating than would normally be expected after that kind of quake, scientists say. \"We expected it might cause a tsunami, just not one that big,\" geophysicist Jason Patton tells the New York Times. Tsunamis like the 18-foot monster wave that wrecked cities on Sulawesi island are usually caused by \"megathrust\" earthquakes that move land vertically, not \"strike-slip\" quakes like the 7.5-magnitude one Friday, which moved the earth horizontally, Patton says. The Sulawesi event was, however, localized, unlike the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. It may have been the case, Patton says, that massive undersea landslides created the tsunami, or that the narrow bay that Palu sits at the end of concentrated the wave's power. Indonesian authorities have been strongly criticized for apparently canceling the tsunami alert too early, though expert Adam Switzer at the Earth Observatory of Singapore tells the AP that this is unfair. \"What it shows is that the tsunami models we have now are too simplistic,\" he says. \"They don't take into account multiple events, multiple quakes within a short period of time. They don't take into account submarine landslides.\" The official death toll now stands at 844, though authorities, who have been preparing mass graves, have been unable to access some hard-hit areas, the Guardian reports.",

The technology, which will be rolled out over the next few months, will allow Disney to determine the age and gender of each guest who walks into one of the parks, as well as whether they've eaten at a Disney restaurant, ridden a Disney ride, or visited a Disney attraction.

Kerry is in Pakistan to lay out the new stakes following bin Laden's death, and question officials about how bin Laden was able to hide in Pakistan for years. In Kabul, Kerry said there is \"some evidence\" that the Pakistan government has knowledge of insurgent activities, calling it \"very disturbing.\"",

He had been wrongfully convicted years earlier in a rape case and served 18 years in prison before he and his nephew, Brendan Dassey, were arrested in Halbach's death. In the filing, Avery takes issue with a search conducted during the murder investigation, saying improperly included multiple properties and therefore any evidence that was uncovered \"is clearly 'FRUIT OF THE POISONOUS TREE,'\" the AP reports.

The team, which has been working in the region since 2008, used a technology called LiDAR (light detection and range technology) to uncover more than 60,000 ancient structures covering 1,305 square miles, including the altar.

This shows that people were aware of other groups and exchanging raw materials long before the arrival of modern humans. \"What is genuinely exciting about the discoveries ... is that we now know that one or more hominin groups were doing seemingly 'modern' things at this critical time period\u2014bringing materials over great distances and passing them on a scale.\" (Click to read about the discovery, which shows how Neanderthals, which may show how Neanderthal and how they've learned how they learned.",

Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups\u2014it's not clear which species is responsible\u2014had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools \u2026 designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)",

Arron Perry's shot from an elevated position was the longest confirmed kill shot in military history, beating the record set by a British sniper in 2009 when he shot a Taliban gunner with a 338 Lapua Magnum rifle from 2,475 meters away. \"This is an incredible feat. It is a world record that might never be equalled,\" a Canadian military insider tells the Globe and Mail. \"The shot in question actually disrupted a Daesh attack on Iraqi security forces,\" a military source says. \"Instead of dropping a bomb that could potentially kill civilians in the area, it is a very precise application of force and because it was so far way, the bad guys didn't have a clue what was happening.\" Over the last 15 years, the record has been broken four times, three of them by Canadians. \"Canadian snipers are the best in the world,\" former Cpl. Rob Furlong tells Maclean's. The sniper training program has been around for a long time. It's the foundation, and it's been retooled from lessons learned in Afghanistan. We've built it to be the best.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 An amazing, if grisly, feat continues to resonate after a report in Thursday's Globe and Mail of Toronto. The newspaper, quoting military sources, says a Canadian sniper in Iraq killed an ISIS militant from the mind-boggling distance of 3,540 meters, or 2.2 miles. The Canadian military has not confirmed what would be the longest kill shot by a sniper in history, but the story has in the meantime drawn attention to something else: the remarkable prowess of Canadian snipers in general. Some coverage: The training: If confirmed, that means the sniper record has been broken four times in the last 15 years, three of those times by Canadians, notes Maclean's magazine. One reason, it says, is because Canadian snipers \"are not simply taught to hit their targets.\" The training goes beyond their shooting duties, making sure they're able to \"design and run complex operations\" if necessary. \"That in itself may not make them better snipers but the gestalt of sniper-training and command-thinking combined could explain their skill.\" Long history: The CBC examines the history of Canada's military marksmanship, noting that Cpl. Francis Pegahmagabow of the 1st Canadian Infantry Battalion had 378 kills, making him deadliest sniper of World War I. A military historian says the skill carried into WWII. \"The best snipers were usually country boys who knew how to hunt.\" Official statement: The Canadian military has not confirmed the kill, but it did confirm the shot. \"A member of the Joint Task Force 2 successfully hit a target from 3,540 meters,\" it says in an email to NPR, adding that it won't divulge further details for troop safety. Really? The Globe and Mail says the shot was verified by video and data, but that hasn't emerged yet, and some are skeptical. The Washington Post talks to former US snipers who say that even seeing a human target would be difficult from that distance, even with advanced scopes. A theory floated by a former Marine shooter: \"A spotter with an advanced optical device was able to verbally walk the sniper onto the target and correct his aim.\u201d Yes: Canadian Cpl. Rob Furlong, who once held the record himself at 2,430 meters, counters the skeptics: \u201cIt\u2019s not an impossible distance,\u201d he says. \u201cSo to the naysayers I would just say, this can be done.\u201d It's a \"hell of a shot,\" adds former Canadian sniper Jody Mitic, who was written a book called, of course, Unflinching: The Making of a Canadian Sniper. A critic: In a post at Stuff.co.nz, John Edens thinks the shot was possible, given high-tech gizmos to account for everything from wind speed to the curvature of the earth. Plus, the gun used, a McMillan TAC-50 rifle, employs a 50-caliber bullet the size of a \"large cigar.\" His beef, though, is with media coverage that he thinks glorifies war. \"It's an achievement to a point, but it's not really one humanity should be proud of.\"",

The species is targeted by poachers who aim to collect their horns for the black market in Asia. Moving endangered animals from one sanctuary to another is called translocation and is done in hopes of establishing healthy populations in new areas.

Paul Holes, a retired Contra Costa County DA who helped lead the investigation, tells the AP that he used the open-source site GEDmatch to find relatives of suspected Golden State Killer Joseph James DeAngelo. He says the site returned a list of relatives\u2014with names and emails\u2014by degree of shared single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs, which offer a genetic fingerprint. On average, you share 50% of your SNPs with a sibling, 25% with a half sibling, 12.5% with a first cousin, and 3.1% with a second cousin. The hits on DeAngelo came from third and fourth cousins, Holes says. \"I'm not familiar with any other case used to capture someone like this,\" says Holes, who built more than 25 family trees using data from the site. The site's operator says he was unaware GEDmatch was used in the search for the East Area Rapist, the Sacramento Bee reports. \"Although we were not approached by law enforcement or anyone else about this case or about the DNA, it has always been GEDmatch's policy to inform users that the database could be used for other,\" he says. Police sources tell the Los Angeles Times that DeAngelo, 72, was living close to where the murders and rapes took place in the 1970s and '80s.",

They now know that they're related to a suspected serial killer. Police say they tracked the suspected Golden State Killer by comparing DNA from one of his many crime scenes to genetic information freely available online, the Sacramento Bee reports. They traced family trees for possible suspects and singled out DeAngelo, a 72-year-old ex-cop, last Thursday. Sacramento County District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert says DeAngelo was placed under surveillance, and DNA collected from discarded items provided \"astronomical evidence\" that he was the killer. Schubert tells the Bee that when she was informed of the DNA test results, \"I probably used a few words I wouldn't put in a newspaper, but basically said, 'You'd better not be lying to me.'\" She adds: \"There were a lot of holy s--- moments.\" DeAngelo was arrested outside his home Tuesday. The San Jose Mercury News reports that investigators used the open-source genealogy website GEDMatch.com to search for the suspect who committed 12 murders and more than 50 rapes between 1974 and 1986. Other genealogy websites, including Ancestry.com and 23andMe, say they weren't contacted by police about the case and that they never provide customer information to law enforcement unless they're legally compelled to.

The leaders were briefed on the intelligence surrounding the attack and on the potential for military action. \"The president will make a decision based on what is best for the US and not what other countries would do,\" officials said on the call, adding that the UK's vote on whether to support military action won't determine what the US does or doesn't do.

The White House's goal is \"preventing Assad from using chemical weapons again,\" a Democratic aide said. As to the British vote against using force, the administration said that \"the president will make a decision based on what is best for the US and not what other countries would do,\" said Rep. Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \"I don't think the UK ought to have a veto on what the US does or doesn't do.\" Officials said Obama still hadn't settled on a course of action\u2014but the Times says \"all indications\" suggest a strike on the heels of the UN's departure from Damascus tomorrow. But we may know more soon: A senior administration official tells CNN the administration will today release declassified intelligence supporting the claim that the Syrian regime launched a chemical attack.",

The papyrus makes an explicit reference to the woman's existence with the line, \"Jesus said to them, 'My wife...'\" Now, extensive testing by professors from Columbia, Harvard, and MIT in the fields of electrical engineering, chemistry, and biology has found no indications that it is a modern forgery, per an article by King published today in the Harvard Theological Review. The Boston Globe says it most likely dates to eighth-century Egypt, and the chemical composition of its ink is in line with the carbon-based inks the people of that country used at the time. But the Globe cautions that a master forger could have accessed the proper materials, and that traditional ink-dating methods couldn't be used because the papyrus is so small: a fragment roughly 1.5-by-3 inches in size bearing just eight incomplete lines (translation here). The Review also published a rebuttal by Brown Egyptology professor Leo Depuydt, who points to \"gross grammatical errors\" he says no native speaker of Coptic would make, the New York Times reports. (More criticism of the papyrus here.) The new findings certainly don't prove that Jesus was married, a point that King has never challenged; she'd like to see the debate shift to discussions of the document's significance, and \"questions like, 'Why does Jesus being married, or not, even matter?'\" King was in 2011 asked to review the fragment at the request of its anonymous owner, who says he bought it more than a decade earlier from a collector who said he purchased it, along with five others, in East Germany in the '60s.",
