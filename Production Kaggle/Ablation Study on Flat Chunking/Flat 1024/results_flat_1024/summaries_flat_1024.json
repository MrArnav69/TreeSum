Here's what people are saying: \"If you're comfortable with the Supreme Court resolving disputes over technology, the transcript of Tuesday's oral arguments in ABC vs. Aero should change your mind,\" writes Lyle Denniston at SCOTUSblog. The court \"struggled to get past a simplistic view of the technology involved,\" he writes. \"That's physically impossible, not just because antennas aren't sensitive enough to detect signals from outside the local market but because the world isn't, you know, flat. And that sounds so much like what a TV system does or what a satellite system does, that it looks as if somehow you are escaping a constraint that's imposed upon them.\" \"Everyone outside the court should be disturbed by a question like that,\" writes Eugene Robinson at the Washington Post. \"At stake here is the degree to which innovative companies are going to have to seek permission from copyright owners to enable people to do in the cloud what they can do for themselves at home.\" \"Most of the energy, at least from the bench, was about the risk that the Court might rule in this case in a way that would smother the infant of digital innovation in its electronic crib,\" writes Denniston. \"She confessed her concern, saying 'this is really hard for me.'\"",

Aereo, a much-watched case that could have big implications for both cloud computing and broadcast television\u2014implications the justices didn't seem comfortable with.

The major broadcast networks are suing it for copyright violation, and stand to lose billions in fees cable companies pay to carry their programming. Aereo says it's simply renting users the equipment to do online what they can legally do at home. Here's how the arguments went: \"If you're comfortable with the Supreme Court resolving disputes over technology, the transcript of Tuesday's oral arguments \u2026 should change your mind,\" writes Jon Healey at the LA Times. Stephen Breyer at one point made an analogy to \"what used to be called a phonograph record store.\" He also worried that Aereo's antennas could \"pick up every television signal in the world,\" which isn't true, Healey pointed out, \"because the world isn't, you know, flat.\" The justices seemed skeptical of Aereo's business model. \"It's not logical to me that you can make these millions of copies and essentially sell them to the public,\" Sonia Sotomayor said. John Roberts said the company was only using thousands of small antennas, instead of a few big ones \"to get around copyright laws,\" the Wall Street Journal reports. But the justices also seemed genuinely worried that their decision could stifle innovation. Sotomayor asked what effect this would have on \"the Dropbox and the iCloud.\" When the broadcasters' lawyers told them to \"just be confident\" that Aereo's service was different, Samuel Alito said, \"I don't find that very satisfying. \u2026 I need to understand what effect it will have on these other technologies.\" Aereo's best hope is that the justices adhere to a lower court's Cartoon Network vs. Cablevision ruling, which held that customers could make DVR recordings on Cablevision's hard drives, writes Lyle Denniston at SCOTUSblog. At one point, Anthony Kennedy suggested lawyers pretend that decision had come from the high court. Ultimately, the justices didn't seem to like their options. \"This is really hard for me,\" Sotomayor confessed. \"I don't see how to get out of it,\" Breyer agreed.",

The turboprop plane crashed into the mountain around 30 minutes into a 42-minute flight without making a distress call, CNN reports. The cause of the crash hasn't been determined, though officials believe the rugged terrain may have played a role. \"There's a possibility the aircraft hit a peak and then fell into a ravine because the place that it was found is steep,\" a search and rescue official tells Reuters, which notes that Trigana has a very patchy safety record, with 14 serious incidents since it started flying in 1991, including 10 in which the aircraft was destroyed. The plane was also carrying $468,750 in cash, which was to be distributed to poor families.",

But when the FDA gave the green light in 2006 for the drug to be used as a schizophrenic aid for kids, new labels said the drug contained high levels of the hormone prolactin, which spurs breast growth, Kline adds. Pledger had started growing breasts by then\u2014and now, the only way he can get rid of them is through a mastectomy, Kline says. A Janssen spokeswoman sent a statement to People noting the company is \"disappointed\" in the decision and that the drug's side effects were clearly spelled out for Pledger's family and prescribing physician. The spokeswoman also argued that Pledger's \"quality of life was significantly improved during the time he was taking Risperdal,\" per the Daily News.

Police say Debra Lynn Harrell, 46, dropped the girl off at the park around 9:30am, then dropped her off at work around 2pm, WFXG reports. When a woman asked where her mother was, the girl told her mother drops her off all the time so she can play while her mother is at work. The girl also said she sometimes walks over to the McDonald's inside Walmart to buy lunch, according to the police report. Harrell confessed to leaving the girl alone at the parks and was arrested and booked into jail on charges of unlawful neglect toward a child. The Department of Social Services took custody of the girl, and she is now in the custody of her paternal grandmother, the Aiken Standard reports. The state's decision is \"coming at a time when it is suffering from a shortage of foster families, as well as a child protective services workforce so overwhelmed that serious child abuse inquiries are regularly closed in violation of policy,\" writes Elspeth Reeve at Slate. \"By arresting this mom (presumably causing her to lose her job) and putting the child in foster care, the state has caused the child far more trauma than she was.\"",

The 46-year-old South Carolina mom repeatedly sent her 9-year-old daughter to a well-trafficked park while she went to work at McDonald's. When the parents of other children at the park found out, they called police, who arrested Harrell and charged her with unlawful conduct toward a child. The daughter has been placed in state custody. Local news outlets first reported the story on July 1, but it's been getting wider attention lately thanks to an indignant post on Reason from \"Free Range Kids\" advocate Lenore Skenazy. And so far, pretty much everyone agrees that the arrest is senseless and wrong. Some reactions: Skenazy notes that the original news reports make it sound like Harrell \"committed a serious, unconscionable crime,\" as locals speculate that the girl could have been kidnapped. \"To which I must ask: In broad daylight? In a crowded park? Just because something happened on Law & Order doesn't mean it's happening all the time in real life.\" \"Since I'm a parent, Harrell\u2019s arrest scares me: How can I appropriately parent my child when doing something that seems relatively safe, if out of fashion, can get you arrested?\" asks Jessica Grose at Slate. One law professor tells Grose that the statutes for child welfare laws are often broadly written, giving police lots of latitude\u2014and allowing \"race, class, and gender biases to influence decisions.\" That could be the case here, because Harrell is black, and her poverty helped cause the situation. \"The story is a convergence of helicopter parenting with America\u2019s primitive family policy,\" writes Jonathan Chait at New York. \"Our welfare policy is designed to make everybody, even single mothers, work full-time jobs. The social safety net makes it difficult for low-wage single mothers to obtain adequate child care. And society is seized by bizarre fears that children are routinely snatched up by strangers in public places,\" which is actually an exceedingly rare phenomenon. \"The state has caused the child far more trauma than she was ever likely to suffer in the park,\" writes Conor Friedersdorf at the Atlantic, and they're taking the child at a time when the state has a shortage of foster families. And there's no empirical evidence saying the child would be safer, say, sitting at McDonald's. \"The actual safety of a given kid is not being rigorously determined.

A former FBI agent tells CBS News Tannerite appears to be \"on the defensive.\" \"It\u2019s just something we have to be aware of that these terrorists are very clever at finding out what components can come together and make an improvised exploding device,\" he says.

Police believe Palma targeted Hatfield for sexual assault, and evidence shows his blood was on her partially ripped underwear and window sill, Fox 25 reports. Palma, who was released from prison in 1986 after being convicted of assault and/or battery with a dangerous weapon, was taken into custody after an officer went through previously collected evidence and submitted it for DNA testing. \"It's proverbial needle in a haystack\u2014how fortunate, lucky we were in this case,'\" the police chief says.",

Kirsten Hatfield disappeared from her bedroom in Midwest City on the night of May 14, 1997, and Anthony Palma, who lived two houses away, was arrested this week on charges of kidnapping and first-degree murder, KOCO reports. The breakthrough in the cold case came after a new investigator took over in June and discovered that key pieces of evidence\u2014including bloodstains on the girl's bedroom window sill and on her underwear, found in her backyard\u2014were never tested for DNA, reports NBC News. Palma, who was released from prison in 1986 after serving time for assault with a dangerous weapon, still lives in the same home, and an arrest warrant states that he probably stayed there \"to conceal evidence of the crime and/or the location of [Kirsten's] body,\" reports NBC. Fox 25 reports that the 56-year-old was interviewed after the 1997 disappearance and provided a DNA sample this year when investigators finally tested the evidence and spoke to 10 suspects in the case. Court documents state that the DNA match to the evidence was 293 sextillion to 1. Police believe Palma targeted the girl for sexual assault and killed her soon after her abduction, reports KOCO. Her body has never been found. (A woman thought to have been murdered in 1984 was found alive and well in Dusseldorf.)",

For these reasons, the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment cannot stand.\u201d Leider's attorney called the ruling \"extremely disappointing\" and said evidence showed elephants had died prematurely because of conditions at the zoo. He said he hoped for a retrial before a jury.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 For years, the Los Angeles Zoo has been under a court order requiring it to exercise its three elephants on soft ground and not use electric shocks or barbed sticks on them. On Thursday, that court order was overturned in a unanimous decision by the California Supreme Court that animal activists are decrying. A Los Angeles County Superior Court judge issued the injunction against the zoo in 2012 in response to a taxpayer lawsuit alleging animal cruelty. But in what the Los Angeles Times calls a \"highly technical ruling\" overturning the injunction, the state's highest court said a taxpayer lawsuit (which uses civil law rules) can't be used to address criminal conduct. The taxpayer lawsuit began in 2007 when an LA resident sued over what he said was abusive treatment of the elephants, also including the use of chains and drugs, Courthouse News Service reports. A lawyer who worked on the case, for free, for more than five years says he'll attempt to find another way to get a similar injunction against the zoo, or request that the state legislature overturn the ruling. \"I thought we had done something here to move the ball forward and instead the Supreme Court has allowed the zoo to take a step into the Dark Ages,\" he says. The Supreme Court explained in its ruling that by obtaining the injunction in such a way, the court did not allow the zoo to have a jury trial or the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The barbed sticks known as bull hooks have since been banned entirely in California, and for its part, the zoo says that it has never used and will never use them or electric shocks as disciplinary tools for its elephants, and that it will continue to follow the court order despite it being overturned.",

The main reasons for the giraffe's decline are habitat loss, poaching, and civil unrest in parts of Africa. \"In these war-torn areas, in northern Kenya, Somalia, and Ethiopia in the border area with South Sudan, essentially the Giraffes are war fodder, a large animal, extremely curious that can feed a lot of people,\" says Dr. Julian Fennessy.

In 1985, there were between 152,000 and 163,000 giraffes, but that number dropped to 97,000 by 2015\u2014a \"devastating decline\" of nearly 40% that now moves the animal from the \"least concern\" category into the \"vulnerable\" one on the group's Red List. \"While there [has] been great concern about elephants and rhinos, giraffes have gone under the radar,\" says Dr. Fennessy, co-director of the IUCN's Giraffe Conservation arm. The updated Red List, released Thursday at a biological diversity conference in Cancun, Mexico, points to man as the main driver of the declining stats, with poaching, habitat loss, and local unrest all assuming partial blame. A Duke University conservation biologist says the IUCN is partly to blame, too, for not considering more species threatened. \"There's a strong tendency to think that familiar species [such as giraffes, chimps, etc.] must be OK because ... we see them in zoos,\" he tells the AP. \"This is dangerous.\" Some good news, at least for some long-neckers: Of the nine giraffe subspecies, three of them are experiencing increasing populations; one is stable.

Under current FDA standards, caffeine in sodas can register no higher than about 71 milligrams per 12-ounce serving. Energy drinks often have between 100 and 300 milligrams of caffeine per 8-oz. serving and are often sold in much larger quantities per can, according to the doctors' letter. In a lawsuit filed Monday in US District Court in Los Angeles, Monster Energy says Herrera's effort would \"impose undue burdens on interstate commerce\" and violate constitutionally protected \"commercial speech\" and other rights. The company, in its lawsuit, maintains that its product has less than half the caffeine of a Starbucks coffee. \"Today, any child can walk into a Starbucks and buy an unlimited number of 'Grande,'\" the lawsuit reads, per the San Francisco Chronicle.",

Neutrinos come in a number of types, and have recently been seen to switch spontaneously from one type to another. The team measured the travel times of neutrino bunches some 16,000 times, and found that the particles sped up 60 billionths of a second earlier than they would have done if they had traveled at the rate of light. This is a tiny fractional change, just 20 parts in a million, but one that occurs consistently. \"This is the first time that we have been able to show that a neutrino travels at a very high speed in a very short period of time,\" says a study co-author.",

Paramount's Titanic made that point in 1997 by costing $200 million and earning nearly $2.2 billion worldwide.

He convinced John Boehner to hold a vote on a bill that would defund ObamaCare\u2014but only if McConnell first agreed to hold talks with President Obama and Harry Reid. That didn't happen, and McConnell's call for no such talks proved too much for Boehner. John Boehner vs. Nancy Pelosi: The former House minority leader was the one to tell Obama and Reid to stand firm, and she told them privately.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 During a White House meeting on Oct. 2, a day into the shutdown, John Boehner slipped out for a smoke. Barack Obama followed him, demanding a private explanation for the shutdown. \"John, what happened?\" he asked. \"I got overrun, that's what happened,\" Boehner replied. That anecdote kicks off Politico's behind-the-scenes look at the crisis. The Wall Street Journal has one too\u2014with different bits of insider gossip. Here are the most interesting tidbits from both: Obama and Harry Reid decided on their no-negotiation strategy over the summer, believing that Boehner could never unite his fractured caucus behind anything. Republicans never believed the pair would stick to it. Boehner and Reid initially struck a deal in which Boehner would pass a sequester-level budget with an ObamaCare-defunding rider that the Senate could simply strip out. Boehner assumed\u2014incorrectly\u2014that his caucus only wanted a show vote. Boehner's former chief of staff was feeding the White House intelligence, telling it that Boehner would have to fight up until the debt ceiling deadline. Reid also took to monitoring Twitter for hints on the GOP's next move\u2014a sign of how badly communication was flowing. Many Republicans turned to Joe Biden, hoping he would intervene. Biden told them he'd been \"sidelined \u2026 at the direction of the president,\" one rep says. Reid, bitter about the fiscal cliff deal Biden negotiated, had wanted him out. At one point, Boehner brought up the idea of a \"grand bargain\" at a White House meeting; Reid laughed in his face. When Paul Ryan joined the fray at an Oct. 10 meeting, he told Obama that he would \"miss his moment\" and derail his whole term if he didn't strike a deal. But he also made what White House aides called a \"Freudian slip,\" saying, \"We\u2019re going to have six weeks to negotiate the debt limit.\" That night, aides to Boehner, Cantor, and Obama began talking about a broader budget deal, and agreed to talk more in the morning. The White House never called. When Mitch McConnell finally decided he had to broker the deal, he partnered with Lamar Alexander\u2014angering Susan Collins, who had worked far harder on the process, only to see her own deal torpedoed. McConnell picked Alexander because he had better conservative credentials, and was pals with Reid confidante Chuck Schumer. Alexander and Schumer brokered the deal behind the scenes, then passed it off to Reid and McConnell. McConnell tells the Washington Post that he saw himself as a backup quarterback thrown into the game. \"I felt like I was on the two-yard line, I had a pretty weak offensive line, and the best I could hope for was to try to punt.\" Boehner made one last-ditch attempt to pass an alternative. \"We're running out of time,\" he told his caucus. \"Your 'no' vote has consequences.\" But as Reid and Obama had predicted, he couldn't convince them. With the ball back in McConnell and Reid's court, McConnell made a few last-minute demands. Reid rejected them. It took all of 15 minutes for McConnell to call back and accept Reid's terms.",

However, with no documented proof, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Friday it must propose the fine. Dr. Cornelis Van der Schyf, vice president for research at the university, blamed partially completed paperwork from 15 years ago as the school tried to dispose of the plutonium. \"Unfortunately, because there was a lack of sufficient historical records to demonstrate the disposal pathway employed in 2003, the source in question had to be listed as missing,\" he said in a statement to the AP.

While the missing amount could not be used to make a nuclear bomb, it could be used to create a so-called dirty bomb to spread nuclear contamination. The university, which has 30 days to dispute the proposed fine, reported the plutonium missing on Oct. 13, according to documents released by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

He dug up a 2004 study that asked 45 men and 18 women to sleep on one side or the other and fill out a popular sleep questionnaire called the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (which evaluates sleep using seven factors, including \"subjective sleep quality,\" sleep duration, and use of sleep drugs). The study found that just 14.6% of right-side sleepers reported bad dreams, compared to 40.9% of their lefty counterparts. Right-side sleepers also reported more dreams with feelings of safety or relief, but had worse-quality sleep than left-siders. Berical also found a 2012 study that analyzed the sleep positions and dreams of over 670 students. The study found that face-down sleepers had more positive and vivid dreams, which were more often about \"sex,\" \"being unable to move,\" \"being tied up,\" or \"being locked up,\" Van Winkles reports. The researcher behind that study, Calvin Kai-Ching Yu, concluded that \"the brain during sleep is not at all totally detached from the external world,\" adding that \"the unconscious brains of the dreamers try to make sense, and even make use of, the external stimuli.\" Berical's conclusion? \"It can\u2019t hurt to roll your loved one over when you sense a nightmare coming on,\" he writes. \"Assuming you can avoid the flailing arms, that is.\" (It turns out that humans are incredibly good at sleeping.)",

Hausknecht was gunned down while riding his bike to work at Houston Methodist Hospital, which is part of the busy Texas Medical Center. Authorities say the shooter rode past Hausknecht before turning around and firing. A tip on Tuesday led police to suspect Pappas, the chief said, though he didn't elaborate as to the nature of the tip. Acevedo said Pappas hadn't been seen in 36 to 48 hours, the AP reports. He said the last anyone had heard from Pappas was in a Tuesday morning text message in which Pappas wrote that he was going to kill himself. Acevedo said police searched his home at 4am Wednesday and found evidence that ties Pappas to the killing, but he declined to elaborate as to the nature of the evidence. The chief said Pappas, who was a peace officer in Harris County for three decades per the Houston Chronicle, is white and very fit, and that he's likely getting around on his 10-speed bicycle, which he rides \"extensively and almost exclusively.\" Friends and family have described Hausknecht as a humble and generous man who was adored by his patients, volunteered in his community and cared about the environment.

The study in the Frontiers in Psychology looked at two popular massively multiplayer online games\u2014EverQuest II in North America and Chevaliers' Romance III in China\u2014and confirmed prior findings that men and women don't have the same goals in playing video games. They also confirmed that men enjoy competitive games while women prefer cooperative ones, while men appear to embrace the title; women are more likely to choose supportive character classes, such as Priests and Healers while men gravitate toward the Barbarians. But the ultimate measure of a gamer isn't what class or guild he or she identifies with\u2014it's his or her level in the game. After analyzing data from more than 9,000 EverQuest II players and 2,000 Chevalier's Romance III players, the researchers found that players who registered as female reach lower levels, on average, than their male peers. \"Once you take into account all these confounding factors, the gender differences disappear,\" says Cuihua Shen, one of the study's co-authors, in a press release.",

And as Cuihua \u201cCindy\u201d Shen, an assistant professor of communication, reports in the Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, when controlling for factors such as time devoted to playing, character choice, and membership in a player's guild, \"The gender differences disappear.\" In fact, she goes on to write for the Conversation, \"Women advanced at least as fast as men did.\" Shen says the findings confirm certain differences in style of play, such as that men tend to focus on competing and gaining in-game status while women tend to play more socially and help others. But in terms of the bottom line: advancing to a higher level, the difference was nil among the 11,000 gamers they analyzed playing Everquest II and Chevalier's Romance III. Aside from one study in 2009, Vocativ reports that this is the first to figure out how to go about testing gender differences in gaming performance outside of a lab. Why does it matter? Nearly half the gaming population is now female, yet they are represented at even lower numbers in STEM fields of science, technology, engineering, and math. \"The stereotype that women are worse players at games could contribute to a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" Shen says.

Among their warnings: The Wall Street Journal reports that the decision could have a huge impact on sites like Netflix and YouTube, whose video services hog a lot of bandwidth (they account for 32% and 19% of peak web traffic, respectively). If ISPs start making Netflix, for instance, pay a usage fee to maintain speedy content delivery, that cost could make a serious dent in its profits\u2014or trickle down to consumers. ISPs could charge sites big fees in exchange for faster content delivery, potentially giving giants who can pay, like Amazon, a big leg up over independent retailers\u2014not to mention other small businesses, the Huffington Post notes.

Another anti-competitive fear, via BuzzFeed: Big companies might start paying your data fees for the use of their sites.

The suits target a number of Colorado lawmakers, including Gov. John Hickenlooper, Revenue Department Executive Director Barbara Brohl, and Marijuana Enforcement Division Director W. Lewis Koski.

Kennedy's PT-109, found the ship off Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific during World War II, the New York Times reports. The ship was part of a \"Magic Carpet\" fleet that transported war prisoners to the US before Japan's invasion, and it was used in the test explosion at Bikini Atoll on July 1, 1946. The bomb exploded off the ship's port quarter, \"causing massive blast damage in that area, and progressively less further forward,\" according to a press release.

But the ship didn't sink: It was raised in 1995 and spent the next 20 years at the bottom of the ocean as a museum ship. On Tuesday, Ballard found the first images he'd ever seen of the ship, which was sunk by the Japanese in the Battle of Ley. The US Geological Survey found it while mapping the seafloor in 1990, but until now, there had been no photos or video of the Independence in its final resting place.

Still, if Tuesday is shaping up to be a night of celebration for the GOP, Politico offers a reality check, at least in the Senate: Several first-term Republicans in vulnerable states will be up for re-election in 2016. So even if Republicans win a small majority this year, they might have to give it right back two years later.",

The public administrator alleges that Wallace Bock and Irving Kamsler failed to file federal gift tax returns for Clark for the years 1997 through 2003, when she made approximately $56 million in gifts to individuals.

The tweet came after Trump met with the CEOs of Boeing and Lockheed Martin on Wednesday, the AP reports. Lockheed is building the US Air Force's next generation of F-35 fighter jets, and Trump has complained about the $379 billion cost of the program. \"We're trying to get costs down,\" Trump said after the meeting. \"It's a very, very expensive program.\" The Pentagon has ordered 2,456 of the planes at a cost of $6.1 billion per jet, more than the cost of all wars put together, the Christian Science Monitor reports. The F-35 is supposed to replace the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy fighter jets that have been in service. Lockheed was supposed to deliver 2,443 of the jets to the United States, UK, and five other countries by 2030, Business Insider reports. Instead, the Pentagon has orders for 2,454, and it's expected to deliver them by 2029. Lockheed's share price plunged almost 2% in after-hours trading after Trump's tweet, the culmination of weeks of interference by the president-elect in the arcane, bureaucratic function of federal procurement. In early December, Trump tweeted that the costs of the new Air Force One planes are \"out of control.\" A Boeing rep tells the Wall Street Journal, \"We will fight to protect our jobs.",

Trump shook up the defense industry once again on Thursday when he tweeted about negotiations for fighter jets, pitting Boeing and Lockheed Martin against each other, reports Reuters. \"Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!\" tweeted Trump, who has been holding meetings with aerospace execs at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Lockheed shares, which went down 4% after an earlier Trump tweet, dived 2% in after-hours trading, while Boeing was up 0.7%. A roundup of coverage: Politico takes a close look at the implications of Trump involving himself so closely in the federal procurement process and turning it into a \"$440 billion weapon.\" Presidents including Obama have used the process to advance their agendas, but experts say it's unprecedented for one to target individual companies and contracts the way Trump is doing\u2014and his approach is likely to create great uncertainty for defense companies. Business Insider looks at the F-35's capabilities\u2014and the $379 billion contract for Lockheed to supply 2,443 of them to the military. Pentagon officials involved with the F-35 says the fifth-generation jet is far ahead of the Boeing plane, meaning it would take years of redesigning and testing for the Super Hornet to have the same capabilities. The AP reports that Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher said: \"We have committed to working with the president-elect and his administration to provide the best capability, deliverability, and affordability,\" while Lockheed declined to comment. Bloomberg reports that Trump's action \"sidelined decades of policy and practice in how the government spends billions of dollars annually on military hardware.\" A Teal Group military aircraft analyst tells Bloomberg that Trump's tweet was \"bizarre,\" especially since only the Navy uses the Super Hornet, while the Marines are \"completely dependent\" on F-35Bs and the Air Force is sticking with the F-35A. \"Thus, Trump's tweet is both late to the game and completely irrelevant.\" Retired Rear Adm. Dave Oliver tells Politico that Trump's attempt to bring the tactics of the New York real estate market to military procurement will probably just drive prices up. \"He will scare the bejesus out of some fifth-level auditor who is going to say, 'Goodness gracious, maybe I ought to look at whoever he is attacking at the moment,' says Oliver, who was a top Pentagon acquisition official in the 1990s. \"Whether the president has any legal standing of any kind in this doesn't matter.

ABC News reports four Republican senators have already said they won't vote for the bill without more information and negotiation: Paul, Lee, Ron Johnson, and Ted Cruz. They released a joint statement saying the bill doesn't do enough to repeal ObamaCare. The bill's writing was cloaked in such secrecy that the Week reports as of Thursday morning quite a few Republican senators still had not seen it; Murkowski, for example, told a reporter, \"I am not a reporter, and I am not a lobbyist, so I've seen nothing.\" President Trump had called the House bill \"mean\" and in need of \"more heart.\" So Scientific American takes a look to see if the Senate version fulfills that requirement.

Here's a look at some of the bigger ones, via the AP, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, SCOTUSblog, and the Washington Post: Abortion: The court could rule as soon as next month on whether states can regulate abortion clinics. A lower court had already struck down a key part of California's law, but a ruling in favor of the state could open the door to similar laws in other states. Unions: If the court rules against them, public sector unions could be in big trouble. The case revolves around California teachers who say forcing them to pay union dues violates their First Amendment rights. Lawyers for the unions argue that they should have to get permission before collecting dues for political purposes. The court has previously ruled that government workers can't be forced to join unions, but this case asks it to overturn a 38-year-old precedent that allowed all workers covered by union negotiations to be charged for representation.

A primer: Unions: Since 1977, unions have been allowed to charge non-union workers for dues that go to collective bargaining efforts, but not political ones. Now California teachers have brought a case saying collective bargaining is itself political. \"It could set the stage for a Citizens United-style reconsideration in the area of union dues,\" a lawyer says. Affirmative Action: Abigail Fisher says that being white played a role in the University of Texas denying her admission back in 2008. The Supreme Court punted on her case in 2013, and now it's back on the docket. Like the unions case, this was brought by a conservative group that recruited the plaintiffs. The death penalty: Justices will decide on capital-punishment cases in Pennsylvania, Kansas, Georgia, and Florida, the Wall Street Journal reports.

That's partly because of the movie Wild, which tells the story of hiker Cheryl Strayed's attempt to walk the trail from California to Oregon. \"There are a whole lot of people that are going to be inspired to hit the PCT because of Wild and we really care about making sure that people are traveling safely,\" a rep for the trail's association tells the magazine. Still, overcrowding is an issue. \"Deserts are fragile,\" an expert tells Outside. \"They're more susceptible to damage and when damage occurs, it lasts longer.\" And that's why the number of permits issued under a quota system that caps them at 50 per day was only introduced in 2015. \"As a direct response to the spike in numbers, the main aim of the quota system is to spread the numbers out and wear on the trail and environmental damage,\" outdoors writer Pete Brook writes in the Los Angeles Times. \"This is especially important in the desert environments that dominate.\" There are no official numbers on how many hikers use the trail each year, but 2,800 long-distance permits were issued in 2015.

But don't take his word for it: The Pacific Crest Trail Association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail. To put things in perspective: 300 people attempted to complete the entire PCT in 2006, according to the AP, with about 120 of those making it. In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the PCTA's Jack Haskel told the AP in 2015. But after the movie, starring Reese Witherspoon, was released in 2014, interest in the PCT exploded. \"Millions are hearing about it now and are being inspired,\" Haskel said. Strayed, more or less unprepared for the journey, hiked 1,100 miles of the trail as a form of therapy as she grappled with personal demons. \"However for others that follow her strategy of deliberate ineptitude, things might not turn out so well,\" writes DontHikeLikeWild.org. \"Our advice to would-be hikers: Grow a spine first.

In a statement to People, the hospital's medical director acknowledges that Hannah \"did not receive the high standard of care we always pride ourselves on.\" The BBC cites an internal hospital report that found what happened to Hannah was due to various factors, including poor communication and staff training, a container without a label, an equipment cart that wasn't adequately stocked, and \"distraction by other life critical tasks.\" An inquiry into the exact cause of Hannah's death will take place in early 2019.

The deal calls for Cohen to cooperate with investigators in their probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election and any links to Trump or his associates. In the plea deal, prosecutors agreed not to bring charges against Cohen based on his statements to Congress about payments he made to women \"in exchange for their silence\" about alleged affairs with Trump, including a $130,000 payment to Karen McDougal in 2015. The deal also calls for the government to pay Cohen's legal fees. Cohen was sentenced in December to two months in prison after pleading guilty to a number of charges, including campaign finance violations. He was also ordered to pay a $50,000 fine. In other developments: Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos met with a Russian professor who claimed to have \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton and a female Russian national who said she was the niece of Vladimir Putin, according to court documents unsealed Monday, the Washington Post reports. According to the documents, Papadopolous told the FBI he met with the professor in March 2016 before he was told he was going to work for the Trump campaign. Ten days later, he met the woman, whom he thought was Putin's niece, investigators say. He told investigators the meetings were superficial and that the purpose of his contacts was to set up a meeting between Trump campaign officials and Russian leaders.",

Papadopoulos initially told the FBI that this contact was a \"nothing,\" but he has since acknowledged that he knew the professor had \"substantial connections to Russian government officials,\" per the New York Times. The case is outlined in court documents here. Papadopoulos also told the FBI that his contact with the professor took place before he joined the Trump campaign, when, in fact, Papadopoulos met with the professor days after becoming an adviser, reports the Guardian. The Times calls his guilty plea, which occurred earlier this month, \"the most explicit evidence connecting the Trump campaign to the Russian government's meddling in last year's election.\" Similarly, Papadopoulos met with a woman he believed to be related to Vladimir Putin after joining the campaign, even though he told the FBI the contact occurred beforehand, reports Business Insider. \"He believed she had connections to Russian government officials; and he sought to use her Russian connections over a period of months in an effort to arrange a meeting between the campaign and Russian government officials,\" per the court filing.",

The researchers injected the mice with a small molecule known as a sonic hedgehog pathway agonist. The compound, which has not been proven safe for human use, is designed to boost normal growth via a gene known as SHH. The gene provides instructions for making a protein called sonic hedgehog, which is essential for development. The injection also led to unexpected benefits in learning and memory, normally handled by a different part of the brain known as the hippocampus. \"Down syndrome is very complex, and nobody thinks there's going to be a silver bullet that normalizes cognition,\" says Reeves.",

Scientists say they've identified a molecule that \"reverses\" the effects of Down syndrome in mice. The molecule is called sonic hedgehog pathway agonist, and it was administered to mice who were genetically altered to have characteristics akin to those of Down syndrome. The molecule, which is not approved as safe for humans, spurs a gene to make a protein tied to development. \"Most people with Down syndrome have a cerebellum that's about 60% of the normal size,\" says one of the Johns Hopkins researchers. Science World Report notes that the mice were injected on the day they were born, at which point their cerebellums hadn't fully developed. The single injection appeared to normalize the cerebellum's growth. In an added surprise, memory and learning, \"which are generally controlled by the hippocampus, not the cerebellum,\" were also positively affected. But the researcher explains that applying the treatment to humans is a tricky proposition, and could have unintended consequences, like raising cancer risk.",

It's harmless when consumed, but when heated to high temperatures, it turns into toxic fumes and has been linked to severe obstructive lung disease known as \"popcorn lung.\" In fact, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health even issued a health alert for factory workers after investigating people who had developed bronchiolitis obliterans, a lung disease characterized by fixed airway obstruction. \"Not only can it pass through the blood-brain barrier, which is intended to help keep toxins out of your brain, but it can also cause brain proteins to misfold into the Alzheimer\u2019s-linked form known as beta amyloid.

For instance, the New York Times' front page featured a photo of Ammon Bundy, one of the militiamen occupying the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, along with the words \"peaceful protest\" and \"armed protesters.\" The AP tweeted about the events: \" Peaceful protest in Oregon rancher arson case followed by building takeover at national wildlife refuge: https://t.co/nsIKxQlyIu\u2014The AP (@AP) January 3, 2016 For many on social media, the reaction seems very different from how the media would react if, say, black or Muslim protesters with guns took over a government building instead of a predominantly white group. \"The public (and media) really do hold racial biases, even if they don't know it,\" Vox argues, citing studies showing that white people are more likely to associate paranormal or magical powers with black people and that police officers are quicker to shoot black suspects in video game simulations. On the other hand, the Oregon protesters are in a largely empty rural area and \"they're not destroying property, they've not looting anything,\" CNN law enforcement analyst Art Roderick tells Vox.

He notes that after terrorists attacks, pundits often ask the Muslim community at large to denounce them, \"but there are no comparable cries demanding that all white people apologize for the militiamen.\" It's a case of \"implicit bias,\" writes Lopez, or \"subconscious prejudices that can change how we approach and treat people of a different race, ethnicity, and religious affiliation.\" It's important that media outlets be aware of the problem, he adds, because the resulting coverage can skew how stories are perceived.

Here's what they're saying: \"Prometheus ends up with less to say than it thinks it does,\" writes Manohla Dargis in the New York Times. \"Though more involving than much of this year's summer blockbuster competition, by the standards set by its wizardly director, it's something of a disappointment,\" she writes. \"It pushes too hard for significance, which is dicey in and of itself genre material and contrasts badly with the standard nature of some of the story's plotting.\" Theron is \"strong here, but from the acting point of view ... belongs to the protean Fassbender, who excels as David, the spaceship's resident android,\" writes Betsy Sharkey in the Los Angeles Times. Fassbender \"gets David's almost-but-not-quite human character exactly right and is especially good at conveying the can-he-be-trusted aspect that always comes with android territory,\" Sharkey writes, but Noomi Rapace \"never quite connects with the tree-hugger aspects of Shaw's character but really comes into her own once things start to go.\" AO Scott calls Fassbender's performance \"precise, witty.\" Prometheus \"could have been an elegant, moody sci-Fi actioner if only it didn't strain so hard (especially in the final scenes) for weighty existential meaning,\" writes Sharkey. It \"explores the limits of science-fiction storytelling in a way that feels fresh and original,\" writes Dargis.",

It\u2019s deep without being particularly smart,\" though its design and effects are so \"dazzling\" you won't realize \"that basic flaw until at least an hour in.\" Joe Morgenstern echoes Stevens in the Wall Street Journal. \"This tale of an interstellar search asks cosmic questions about the meaning of life, but comes up with lame answers in a script that screams attention-deficit disorder,\" he notes. Still, it's \"worth seeing for the quality of its sci-fi sights.\" In the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan notes that the movie \"pushes too hard for significance,\" which \"contrasts badly with the standard nature of some of the story's plotting.\" For \"its wizardly director, it's something of a disappointment.\" But at the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert raves that Prometheus is \"a seamless blend of story, special effects, and pitch-perfect casting, filmed in sane, effective 3-D that doesn't distract.\" And Ebert finds it \"all the more intriguing because it raises questions about the origin of human life and doesn't have the answers.\"",

McCone, who died in 1991, testified that the CIA had no evidence to suggest Oswald was part of a foreign conspiracy, foreign or domestic, and the commission agreed.

According to an article written by the agency's senior in-house historian, the CIA purposely held back information from the Warren Commission, Politico reports. John McCone, then the agency's director, apparently failed to tell the commission about agency plots to murder Fidel Castro (including ones involving the Mafia). So the commission never knew to ask whether Lee Harvey Oswald had Cuban comrades dead-set on retaliating against the US president. The commission famously concluded that Oswald acted alone, spawning decades of conspiracy theories involving Castro, the Mafia, the CIA, the Soviets, and even President Lyndon B. Johnson. Seems the White House nudged McCone along: He \"shared the administration\u2019s interest in avoiding disclosures about covert actions that would circumstantially implicate [the] CIA in conspiracy theories and possibly lead to calls for a tough US response against the perpetrators of the assassination,\" reads the article, which was published in a CIA internal magazine in 2013 and declassified (with 15 redactions) last fall. McCone also apparently didn't reveal that the CIA may have been communicating with Oswald before the killing, and was illegally reading his mail after he tried defecting to the Soviets in 1959. The article, by CIA historian David Robarge, calls McCone's actions \"benign\" but says the cover-up played a big role in \"undermin[ing] the credibility of the commission.\" (Click for a list of the most pervasive JFK conspiracy theories.)",

Researchers found the Instagram posts of depressed people tended to be less saturated, darker, and more blue. Depressed people tended to use the Inkwell filter most often (non-depressed people preferred Valencia) and got more comments on their posts (non-depressed people got more likes). Depressed people also posted more photos of faces but had fewer faces per photo.

Diane Savino, per the New York Post, cheered the settlement, calling on the NFL to \"develop uniform rules \u2026 to ensure that all cheerleaders in every state received the employee pay and protections they deserve.\" NFL teams have sought to justify low pay for cheerleaders by saying they're independent contractors, CNN notes. In the case of the Flight Crew, Krystal C.'s suit claimed that cheerleaders were compensated $150 per game and $100 for special appearances. But, when you factor in practices and rehearsals, that pans out to $3.77 per hour.

Starting today, you'll no longer be able to read about email, open-mike nights, or Walmart on the paper's website, and the style changes are a result of a mix-up over the spelling of \"microphone\" and the difference between an abbreviation and a short form, editor-in-chief Martin Savidge explains in a post at the Post. \"Mic is an aberration,\" he writes. \"Words like that aren't pronounced like that.\" \"For many years, I've been rooting for\u2014but stopping short of employing\u2014what is known as the singular they as the only sensible solution to English's lack of a gender-neutral third-person singular personal pronoun,\" copy editor Bill Walsh writes in a memo to staffers. \"What finally pushed me from acceptance to action on gender- neutral pronouns was the increasing visibility of gender- Neutral people.\" The move comes after numerous publications, including the Baltimore Sun and Pittsburgh City Paper, have adopted the use of \"they\" as singular pronouns for stories about people who identify as neither. They, as in \"they,\" instead of \"he,\" is the choice. It's been in use since at least the 1300s, reports Megan McArdle at Quartz. They have been used to refer to a single person or a group of people for centuries. \"There's just no good reason to embrace it,\" she writes.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Jane Austen wrote, \"To be sure, you knew no actual good of me\u2014but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love.\" But had she submitted that line to a modern English teacher, she would have gotten docked for grammar. Instead of \"when they fall in love,\" it should be \"when he falls in love,\" or perhaps the clunkier \"when he or she falls in love,\" right? That has long been the prevailing view, but after a slow and steady creep, that view seems to be disappearing. In fact, this year might be the tipping point for acceptance of the \"singular they.\" Quartz, for example, has dubbed singular they its Word of the Year. And earlier this month, the Washington Post changed its style guide to accept it, though the guide still encourages reporters to first try to write around it by recasting the sentence as plural, notes Poynter. So, \"All students must complete their homework, not Each student must complete his or her homework,\" per the guide. But when that kind of rewrite is \"impossible or hopelessly awkward,\" writers should employ the singular they. One big factor behind the shift\u2014not just at the Post but in newspapers, online posts, and English classrooms across the country\u2014is the increasing acceptance in society of those who identify as neither male nor female. The singular they solves the problem. (On a related note, the New York Times now permits \"Mx.\" as a gender-neutral honorific in place of Mr. or Ms., notes Quartz.) Grammatical purists may protest, but they are simply wrong, writes English teacher Anne Curzan at the Chronicle for Higher Education. \"There is nothing grammatically wrong with singular they other than the fact that people say there is something wrong with it,\" she writes, noting the similarity to the outdated rule, still enforced in places, about not splitting infinitives. Adds Anna Walsh at Baltimore's City Paper, \"Using language that's more accurately inclusive is something that every grammarian should be able to get behind, regardless of what pronouns they personally use.\" (The Internet seems to have invented a preposition.)",

The US stopped sending lethal aid to the rebels last summer over fears the weapons would end up in the hands of Islamist militants, but officials say they're now more sure that weapons are going to moderate groups rather than jihadist ones.

The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, and the Nusra Front, both of which are offshoots of al-Qaeda, have seized control of most of the nation's oil and gas fields, turning what was once an essential source of income for Syria into a driving force in a war that is tearing the country apart. \"Syria is an oil country and has resources, but in the past they were all stolen by the regime,\" says an anti-government activist in Deir al-Zour. \"Now they are being stolen by those who areProfiting from the revolution.\"",

That's according to a new study in Climatic Change that finds rising temperatures will make it harder for some planes to take off in the hottest parts of the day. The New York Times reports the study found that 10% to 30% of fully loaded planes will have to dump some weight if takeoffs aren't possible on the hottest days. \"Our results suggest that weight restriction may impose a non-trivial cost on airline and impact aviation operations around the world,\" study author Ethan Coffel says in a Columbia University press release. The problem is that air is getting thinner as it warms, and that thin air means less lift for the plane's wings, which then race along the runway. The study\u2014which looked at 20 busiest airports in the US, Europe, the Mideast, China, and south Asia\u2014predicts that by 2080, maximum daily temperatures at airports worldwide will be up 4 to 8 degrees Celsius (7.2 to 14.4 degrees Fahrenheit) by. This is only part of the problem, the study says, and heat waves will also be more common. \"This points to the unexplored risks of changing climate on aviation,\" says Coffel.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Remember in June when it got too hot for planes to take off in Phoenix? A new study suggests stories like that will become quite common in the not-too-distant future. Via Reuters, the study published in Climatic Change estimates that rising temperatures could leave up to one-third of planes grounded during heat waves in the coming decades. The problem centers around the wings\u2019 capacity for lift, which is lessened in warmer conditions. By 2100, worldwide average temperatures are expected to rise by 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit. To safely take off, airlines would need to make adjustments during the hottest part of the day, with 10% to 30% of planes affected. Full flights will either stay grounded until conditions cool down or lighten their loads by removing fuel, cargo, or passengers, per a release at EurekAlert. Think 12 to 13 people asked to leave a 160-person passenger plane. \"Our results suggest that weight restriction may impose a non-trivial cost,\" one of the study\u2019s lead authors says. Wired reports that among the airports studied, New York\u2019s LaGuardia and Washington\u2019s Reagan-National fared poorly because of short runways, as did Dubai International Airport, where extreme heat could force reduced loads up to 55% of the time during peak temperatures. Better news: New York's JFK wouldn't be much affected. Delayed departures won't be the only hassle. Scientists say severe turbulence would become more common. \u201cI\u2019ve yet to see a benefit of climate change to aviation,\u201d says atmospheric scientist Paul Williams, who believes it\u2019s high time for the airline industry to prepare and adapt.

At one point, when a critic likened Andreessen's position to \"Internet colonialism,\" he shot back, \"Anti-colonialism has been economically catastrophic for the Indian people for decades.

The panel was led by Robert Kennedy Jr., chairman of the World Mercury Project. According to BuzzFeed News, Kennedy believes journalists are working with the CDC to bury the truth about a vaccine ingredient called thimerosal causing autism in children, and he offered a $100,000 reward to anyone who can produce a study that finds vaccines with the ingredient are safe for kids and pregnant women. De Niro, who was mostly quiet during the panel, did speak up to say he agrees with Kennedy \"100%.\" Science, on the other hand, does not. Doctors, medical organizations, and the CDC say Kennedy's beliefs are unequivocally false. The director of a vaccine education center says seven studies published between 2000 and 2007 alone show that. Furthermore, thimerosal hasn't been used in children's vaccines since 1999 and is barely used in flu vaccines anymore, but autism rates are rising anyway, notes BuzzFeed. Kennedy met with Trump in January about heading a commission on vaccine safety. He says he's spoken to aides three times about the commission since then and expects it to happen, Stat reports. With that on the horizon, 350 medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, sent a letter to Trump last week reasserting the safety of vaccines.",

Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they examined the medical records of nearly 500,000 Medicare beneficiaries who visited an emergency department for an opioid prescription between 2008 and 2011.

The rate of \"long-term opioid use\"\u2014defined as more than 180 days of use\u2014was 10.3% higher for patients prescribed opioids than for those who received them from physicians who did not bill for ER visits.

It may sound like an obvious chain of events, but it remains unclear why two patients given the same opioid prescription after similar complaints have different addiction risks depending on their ER doc. The takeaway is \"not that high-intensity prescribers are necessarily irresponsible in prescribing opioids to certain patients,\" the lead author tells the New York Times. But \"their patients have worse outcomes that we weren\u2019t aware of before.\" After tracking 375,000 Medicare patients in ERs between 2008 and 2011, researchers found that one in every 48 patients prescribed opioids ends up using them long-term, or more than half a year. But when comparing \"high-intensity\" prescribing docs (who gave opioids to one in four patients) to \"low-intensity\" prescribers (one in 14), patients of the first group had a 30% greater risk of turning into long-time users. It may be a simple numbers game, as observed in a post at Pacific Standard: \"The more prescriptions doctors give out, the more likely they'll end up handing a script to someone who will have a serious problem later.\" But one doctor sees a larger issue: Among ER doctors, there's no consensus \"about when to prescribe opioids and what dose to give.\" (This is how long it takes to become dependent.)",

The San Francisco Chronicle lists five things to look for in Trump's address, including efforts to reassure foreign leaders. Ad-libs are also a strong possibility, though analysts say trying to wing it could be a big mistake. The speech was largely written by incoming senior White House adviser Stephen Miller, Politico reports in its guide to inaugural events, which includes viewing tips and the order of the ceremony. The Washington Post looks at the many demonstrations that will be taking place across the capital on Friday, including a few pro-Trump events, as well as numerous \"counterinaugural\" protests. The \"Let America Hear Us, Roar for Trump\" group will be sharing Dupont Circle with a pro-marijuana group that plans to hand out 4,200 joints. Time takes a look back at every Inauguration Day in US history, and at what every president had to say on the occasion. The Times of London reports on the \"security nightmare\" posed by Trump's first ride in the presidential limousine, which will take him past tens of thousands of people between the Capitol and the White House. Many will be watching to see whether he chooses to walk part of the way as predecessors including Obama did. The New York Times speaks to five Trump voters from very different backgrounds to find out why they traveled to DC for the inauguration. Protests are taking place in cities across the world, but in Melania Trump's hometown in Slovenia, they're getting ready for a huge party, TMZ reports.

The president's plan would also relax the complex divisions between which offenses are dealt with at federal, state, and local levels. At present, some local police refuse to act to prevent federal crimes like drug trafficking. It would also seek to establish a national identity number or document, though it was unclear what form that would take. The plan\u2014which will be formally presented next week\u2014will focus first on Guerrero, Michoacan, Jalisco, and Tamaulipas, where the government has already sent significant contingents of federal police and soldiers. As if to underscore the problem, authorities said today that they had found the decapitated, partly burned bodies of 11 men dumped on the side of a road near another Guerrero city.",

But critics say the president is merely repacking initiatives already in progress and trying to repeat a few failed ones, and question is whether things will be any better if the police are put under unified control. \"The root problem is the quality of the police, not who commands them,\" a public security expert tells the Wall Street Journal. \"Many state forces are also a disaster.\" The president's plan will focus on four of the most violent states at first, including Guerrero, where the students were kidnapped and where 11 decapitated bodies were found dumped by a road yesterday, the AP reports.",

The mice arrived on the island via shipwrecks and sealing ships in the 1800s, wiping out two species of insect and pushing some sea birds to breed on nearby islands. A $4 million project to get rid of the mice started in 1980, and the last mouse was caught in 2010. \"I am proud to look back and see how far we've come in just 10 years,\" says the project's leader. Researchers are working on a technique called the Trojan Female Technique, which targets mitochondria, the tiny power plants inside cells, which can impair the ability of sperm to swim. Females carrying the mutations would have sterile male offspring, but their daughters would be able to breed, producing yet more. Twenty-one species of breeding seabirds, including the critically endangered Antipodean wandering albatross, nearly one in five unique to the islands, will be among the beneficiaries of the successful eradication project, says conservation minister Eugenie Sage. \"They can now thrive with mice no longer preying on.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A subantarctic archipelago is making \"huge news\": The New Zealand Herald reports there are officially no more mice on the country's Antipodes Islands, which once housed up to 200,000 of the rodents. They caused a big threat to the World Heritage Site by preying on native birds, bugs, and plants, and the five-year effort to do away with them got an assist from the public, with the \"Million Mouse Project\" fundraising campaign bringing six figures. The Department of Conservation explains that cereal bait laced with rodent toxin was dropped via helicopter on the island during the winter of 2016. A team scoured the island last month looking for any mice and found none. \"This is huge news for conservation both in New Zealand and internationally,\" says New Zealand Conservation Minister Eugenie Sage. She says more than two dozen types of birds, 21 uncommon plants, and more than 150 insect species will benefit. Both Radio New Zealand and NPR note the mice originally found their way to the Antipodes either on 19th-century ships or via a shipwreck and proceeded to purge the island of at least two insect species, as well as to displace some seabirds to other islands. The initiative in the Antipodes isn't a stand-alone: The island nation has also gotten rid of other invasive species in the name of boosting biodiversity, including goats, rats, cats, rabbits, and a local meat-eating weasel. New Zealand's ultimate goal is to rid itself completely of all invasive pests by 2050, per Nature. (Scientists are bashing in the heads of invasive iguanas in Florida.)",

As for the airstrikes, targeted ones may be necessary near the mountain to \"break the siege\" there, says Obama, and allow more help to arrive and avert a \"genocide.\" The bigger reason for the possible airstrikes, however, seems to be to halt the advance of the extremist fighters in the north.

Researchers in Brazil examined 29 infants who had microcephaly, a condition in which a baby's head is underdeveloped, and found the virus in all but one of them, NBC News reports. \"We are concerned that these lesions are going to have an effect on vision as the babies get older,\" says one doctor. \"If you look at some of the images, you will see little clumps of black pigment. Those shouldn't be there.\" Researchers say the virus appears to favor neurons in the fetus' brain, though it's not clear how the virus stopped brain development at 20 weeks. The study's lead author, Dr. Bruno de Paula Freitas, tells the New York Times that the infants' brains were \"totally different\" than infants born to mothers who hadn't tested positive for Zika. The researchers say the children's eyes were also affected, with nearly 30% of them showing eye abnormalities. \"It is very difficult to measure visual function in a newborn baby,\" another doctor says. \"There is a lot of testing that not been done yet.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The Zika virus' apparent effect on fetuses is on shocking display in a new study in the New England Journal of Medicine that was rushed to publication given the virus' spread. Though it offers no definitive link between Zika and fetal abnormalities, the study does produce the first evidence of virus transmission from mother to child and \"the strongest evidence yet that the virus causes abnormally small heads and incomplete brain development,\" reports the Verge. The study centers on a 25-year-old Slovenian woman who became pregnant while volunteering in Brazil in February 2015. She developed a high fever and rash during her 13th week of pregnancy, but ultrasounds at 14 and 20 weeks showed no issues. When she returned to Slovenia in October, however, doctors found extensive brain damage in the fetus and the pregnancy was aborted, per NBC News. An autopsy found the full genome of the Zika virus exclusively in the fetus' unusually smooth and scarred brain, suggesting the virus only attacked nerve tissue, per Reuters. The mother had no family history of genetic abnormalities and the fetus tested negative for 13 other viruses known to cause birth defects. \"You have a mother who's infected, a fetus that's abnormal, and in the fetus, you have the genetic signature of the virus,\" says an infectious disease expert. \"This is clear data showing Zika can infect the fetus.\" An epidemiologist adds \"it sounds like a pretty clear case of extreme microcephaly.\" Scientists suspect brain development may have stopped around 20 weeks, leading one doctor to suggest that Zika, like other viruses linked to birth defects, may be most dangerous in the early stages of pregnancy.

Two of the victims were reportedly shot when attempting to help the first victim, and all three were hospitalized. According to ABC News, one of the men has died and another victim is in critical condition. Police say there is no indication the shooter knew the victims, the AP reports. The second shooting took place at a grocery store about eight miles from the mall and left a woman dead, the Washington Post reports. It's unclear if the two shootings are related. Police say Eulalio Tordil, wanted on suspicion of shooting and killing his estranged wife outside a Maryland high school on Thursday, may be responsible for one or both of Friday's shootings. He was arrested Friday afternoon, according to NBC News. Tordil allegedly followed his wife to the school, where she was picking up her children, and shot her. Police say he also shot and injured a person attempting to help his wife. CNN reports the 62-year-old Tordil is a law enforcement officer with the Federal Protective Service who was put on administrative leave in March after a protective order was issued against him.",

Sovaldi, which is currently the only FDA-approved treatment for Hepatitis C, costs $94,000 a year for a full course. The report, which reviewed more than 20,000 pages of company documents, says the price was \"always Gilead's plan to max out revenue, and that accessibility and affordability were pretty much an afterthought,\" the Washington Post reports. Sen. Charles Grassley and Sen. Ron Wyden led the investigation and released the report Tuesday. They accuse Gilead of \"arbitrary, capricious, and possibly illegal price increases.\" The report says Sovaldi's price was raised partly because Gilead expected to set a benchmark for the next generation of hepatitis C drugs, and because insurers and Medicaid programs started restricting access to Sovaldi and its competitors as demand for the treatment increased. \"This might be an example that received the most attention in some time, but it won't be the last,\" Wyden said in a statement, per Business Insider. Gilead responded to the report with a statement saying its prices are \"in line with previous standards of care.\"",

Gilead Sciences, the sixth richest drugmaker in the world, \"is making a fortune selling essential drugs to the very government and taxpayers that helped pay to develop them, and then dodging taxes on the resulting profits,\" says Frank Clemente, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, which issued the report this month. Gilead has avoided some $10 billion in taxes by moving assets to Ireland, where there is a lower tax rate, and then not bringing some $28.5 billion in profits back into the US. Per the Washington Post, the California-based company's revenues in 2015 hit $32.6 billion, up three times from 2012. As for the accusation of gouging: Last year, a Senate investigation found that the company \"pursued [a] profit-driven strategy\" with its hepatitis drugs, rather than making the drugs more accessible at a lower price (it had considered $50,000). As the Post notes, Gilead, which declined to comment on the report, isn't alone in looking overseas for tax relief. Plenty of other pharmaceutical and technology companies do it. Apple, for instance, has squirreled away nearly $200 billion abroad, Bloomberg reported last year. According to Citizens for Tax Justice, that's enabled the company to avoid paying $59.2 billion in US taxes. Pfizer has some $193 billion abroad, per the Post. The new report singling out Gilead, the Post points out, highlights the \"simmering battle\" between President Obama and big business over the practice of sending assets to foreign countries.",

The most common injury was to the low back, which was responsible for 16% of injuries and was followed by the hamstrings and lower leg (13.9% each), the New York Times reports.

A follow-up study published in 2012 noted that one safety-related change made in 2003 was an expansion of the landing pad's minimum dimensions. In the 8 years that followed, the study noted only two of the 19 catastrophic injuries were fatal. But the rest weren't pretty: major head injuries and spine or pelvic fractures were among them. And a study of collegiate pole vaulters published this last January found 41% sustained some kind of injury, a figure that researchers saw as suggestive of the fact that \"injuries are very common in experienced vaulters.\" The injury stats aren't good, and the potential pay and fame aren't much better. So why the heck do it? Vice talked to US record-holder Brad Walker (one of 18 men to ever clear 6 meters), who sums up vaulters as \"risk-takers, usually with something to prove to themselves ... you won't find a vaulter jumping high who doesn't have at least one screw loose.\" As for why they stay with it, Vice points to its highly technical and challenging nature: As you approach the box you're a sprinter; then you're a gymnast.

Walruses use ice as a sort of conveyor belt over new ocean bottom, but sea ice has melted to the point where it's too deep for the mammals to stay on the edge.

Several hundred Pacific walruses began amassing on an island off Alaska\u2019s northwest coast in the first week of August in what wildlife officials say is the earliest date yet for their annual \"haulout.\" The culprit appears to be shrinking Arctic ice. Walruses tend to head ashore two weeks after warm temperatures cause sea ice to recede too far north for them in the Chukchi Sea. This year, it happened earlier than ever. Walruses typically use sea ice for protection and as a home base, particularly for juveniles, while adults dive to the ocean floor for food. But \"when that ice retreats to the deeper water, they can't do that,\" Fish and Wildlife rep Andrea Medeiros tells Alaska Public Media. For the past several years, a barrier island near Point Lay has served as an alternative home base. Last year, thousands of walruses had arrived there by Oct. 7. This year, however, the haulout was observed beginning on Aug. 3\u2014a full two weeks ahead of the next earliest date observed back in 2011, reports Alaska Dispatch News.

Officials would rather you not.

The Deseret News takes a look back at the 185-year-old milestone, which the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints calls a \"series of miraculous events.\" A topic page on the LDS Church's website states that Smith was asked to \"render into his own language an entire volume of scripture amounting to more than 500 printed pages.\" So \"God prepared.\" The Mormon Tabernacle Choir's performance in Salt Lake City last week drew thousands of people to the Utah city's Temple Square. But there was one person who wasn't there: Joseph Smith, the man credited with translating the book into English. He was in his early 20s at the time and had \"very little formal education\" and was \"incapable of writing a book on his own, let alone translating an ancient book written from an unknown language,\" according to the church website. He dictated the book's translation to scribes and didn't call for punctuation. Instead, he tasked them with setting the type. The seer stone, believed to be the same one Smith used to translate the book from Hebrew to Mormon English, was found in a remote part of Box Elder County, just south of Salt Lake city. The church says it has always possessed the seer, which was transported across the country during Smith's lifetime, and has been kept in a weathered leather pouch made by one of his wife, Emma Smith, who was one of the only the only one the only a major, the only two, who had a major (both both, and both, which could go, which, which had a feat to which which which could prove to which only to which the feat, which which ended to which could end, to which just which which the only only which which only which could get to which, to get to go to the only to the chance to end to the could go to go (the chance to change to both to have both to the two.",

The photos have been published in a book that also includes pictures of the \"printer's manuscript\" of the Book of Mormon\u2014a handwritten copy of the original manuscript that was produced by one of Smith's scribes. The book, which Smith said he translated from \"reformed Egyptian\" with the stone, recounts a visit from Jesus Christ to North America, reports the Salt Lake Tribune. As for the translation, the church has this to say: \"Joseph placed ... the seer stone in a hat, pressed his face into the hat to block out extraneous light, and read aloud the English words that appeared on the instrument.\" It says the translation occurred over three months in 1829 as part of a \"a series of miraculous events.\" Indeed: In March, the Deseret News reported that the church says it takes roughly five years to translate and then produce the Book of Mormon in another language. The church says it is trying to make its history more \"tangible\" with the release, but Terryl Givens, professor of literature and religion at the University of Richmond, tells the AP that the church is also trying to show skeptics it has nothing to hide. \"Other churches' origins are concealed by the mist of history.

If the referendum passes, approximately 80,000 more Maine residents making up to 138% of the poverty level will be eligible for Medicaid. In addition to decreasing the number of uninsured Maine residents, supporters of the referendum say it will add jobs and help rural hospitals stay open. LePage, while attacking Maine hospitals for their support of the referendum on Friday, said it would take \"resources away from our most vulnerable Mainers\" to \"give free taxpayer-funded healthcare to adults who should be working and contributing,\" the Press Herald reports.

Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book\u2014Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\u2014has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.\u201d",

It's the first federal guidelines on the subject, though the Times notes that anti-circumcision groups are likely to fight them tooth-and-nail. The CDC says the procedure can lower a male's risk of sexually transmitted diseases, penile cancer, and urinary tract infections, and that health insurers should pay for it, reports the AP. The guidelines \"are part of a long historical American cultural and medical bias to attempt to defend this traumatic genital surgery,\" says the director of the Circumcision Resource Center, which opposes the procedure. But a University of Washington pediatrics professor tells the AP that the guidelines are \"more neutral\" than the American Academy of Pediatrics, which issued its own set of guidelines in 2012. The CDC started working on the guidelines about seven years ago, when a cluster of influential studies in Africa indicated circumcision might help stop spread of the AIDS virus. \"The benefits of male circumcising have become more and more clear over the last 10 years,\" says a Johns Hopkins University researcher involved in one of the African studies.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 To snip or not to snip? Male circumcision carries \"low\" risks but has \"dramatic\" benefits, according to draft guidelines released by the CDC yesterday. The long-awaited guidelines say that the procedure can greatly reduce the risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases for heterosexual men, reports Reuters, which notes that circumcision rates have dropped 10% to 58% over the last three decades. Circumcision is a personal decision, and the guidelines will stop short of recommending all newborn boys undergo the procedure, but \"the scientific evidence is clear that the benefits outweigh the risks,\" a CDC spokesman tells the AP. The CDC says that circumcision can reduce the risk of a man getting HIV or herpes from a female partner by around 50%. It also makes sex safer for female partners, although it doesn't appear to reduce the risk of contracting STDs during anal sex with other men. The draft guidelines\u2014which will face stiff opposition from anti-circumcision groups\u2014say the risk of complications from circumcision is only 0.5% for newborns, reports the Los Angeles Times. That rises to 9% among children, then drops to 5% among adults, though the guidelines\u2014which say circumcised men \"generally report minimal or no change in sexual satisfaction or function\"\u2014note that waiting for a boy to reach adolescence or adulthood lets him choose for himself.

The heart cells, created in the lab from skin cells, were quickly incorporated into damaged areas of the heart and helped the organ to pump more vigorously. But all of the monkeys developed unusual heart rhythms after the treatment, leading researchers to say more work is needed before the treatment can be considered safe enough for human trials. \"Currently, the only long term option for these patients is heart transplantation, but there are not enough donors to meet the current demand,\" a heart researcher says. \"Ideally, immune rejection would be eliminated if the cells could be derived from the same patient, but this is costly and time consuming at a time when the patient requires immediate treatment. Another concern is that the incomplete integration of the transplanted cells could result in irregular heart beats which can be deadly.\"",

Or at least that's the hope after scientists successfully used lab-created heart muscle cells to partially repair damaged hearts in monkeys, Live Science reports. The healthy stem cells were easily absorbed into the damaged hearts and allowed the organ to pump blood more easily. The procedure could lead to a new way to treat heart attacks and at least partially repair heart damage, the Guardian reports. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men and women in the US. Scientists are intrigued by the idea of treating damaged hearts by using a patient's own skin cells to create healthy heart cells, which are less likely to be rejected since they don't come from a donor. In the latest study in the journal Nature, the team at Shinshu University induced heart attacks in five macaques and then injected them with heart cells made from the skin of a healthy macaque who was a close genetic match. To avoid rejection, they ensured the donor monkey had a type of protein similar to the recipients' and they gave the sick monkeys anti-rejection drugs. After studying the macaques for three months, researchers found their immune systems tolerated the new cells, which replaced about 16% of the damaged heart tissue. In the end, the monkeys' heart muscles contracted better, pumping blood more efficiently. Human trials are not coming anytime soon, though, after the macaques developed irregular heartbeats. Still, doctors said the findings raise the possibility of treating damage caused by heart attacks. \"Currently, the only long term option for these patients is heart transplantation, but there are not enough donors to meet the current demand,\" heart researcher Sam Boateng told the Guardian.

She eventually founded the Alaska Cannabis Club, which allowed people to buy \"donations\" of marijuana. But after six undercover purchases and two raids in a five-month period, authorities charged Greene with eight felony counts of operating a business under the state's legalization law.

But as the Guardian reports, her ensuing off-screen plight has been largely ignored, even though she faces more than a half-century in prison. That's because Greene, whose legal name is Charlene Egbe, isn't just a cannabis advocate but the owner of the Alaska Cannabis Club, which she created on April 20, 2014, a full six months before Alaska voted to legalize the adult use of cannabis. In other words, she was receiving \"donations\" for marijuana through club \"memberships\" before it was legal to do so. Police raided the club twice and detectives made several undercover purchases, and though Greene wasn't directly involved in them, state prosecutors are charging her because the club is registered under her name. She's pleaded not guilty to charges of \"misconduct involving a controlled substance,\" and the original indictment listed eight offenses that amounted to a possible 24 years in jail. The Guardian broke the news to Greene that six offenses have since been added, raising the total to 54 years. In the Weed Blog, Greene calls this a \"modern-day lynching,\" and tells High Times that she hopes the cannabis community rallies behind her. \"I need help more than ever,\" she says. \"Now that I could lose the rest of my life because of cannabis, it feels like the people I fought for have abandoned me.\" (Alaskans can't smoke weed in public.)",

Here's what they're saying: \"A Baywatch movie needn't be high art\u2014its TV inspiration certainly wasn't\u2014but did it have to be this inane?\" asks Brian Lowry at CNN. He claims you'd have about as much luck finding a lost item buried in sand as you would finding a laugh in this movie. As for those beach babes, they're \"skimpy compensation to justify a water-logged trip back to the beach that, the Rock notwithstanding, sinks like a stone.\" It works for the first half-hour or so thanks to Zac Efron and Dwayne Johnson's \"playful chemistry,\" but then it starts to drown.

It \"wants to be smart-dumb, but winds up being dumb-dumb \u2026 a few funnies, some tanned, toned bodies and a half-baked plot.\" But then, this is Baywatch. \"What did you expect?\" Yes, it's \"lightweight, a tiny bit crude and a trillion grains of sand away from anything approaching realism.

The jokes\u2014which are, perhaps surprisingly, not made at the expense of female characters\u2014are \"plain dumb,\" but still generate a laugh, she writes. Plus, it's hard not to enjoy all the beautiful people. \"You could do worse,\" Zacharek concludes. Bruce Demara wholeheartedly disagrees. This is a movie for \"immature, socially maladjusted males.\" For everyone else, \"even sand in your shorts would be less annoying,\" he writes at the Toronto Star.

Democrats had held the governorship in West Virginia since 2001. While Democrats weren't given notice of Justice's switch, they probably shouldn't be surprised. Justice only joined the Democratic Party in 2015 to run for governor. He had been a registered Independent and Republican prior to that and even donated to the Republican Governors' Association a few years before his run as a Democrat. He's also friends with the Trump family and Sen. Mitch McConnell. Plus, the ever-more conservative West Virginia is a hotbed of Trump support. With Justice's defection, there are only 15 Democratic governors in the US and only six states in which Democrats control the governorship and both legislative chambers, the Hill reports.

Once the storm hits, it will be very difficult to respond to distress calls.\" Irene is some 700 miles wide now and moving at a slow 12mph, which means it can wreak extensive damage in a region over a long period of time; it could cause up to $13.9 billion in damage on the East Coast. The storm is expected to barrel into New York City on Sunday, packing winds of up to 90mph. New Jersey communities are already being evacuated, and hundreds of street fairs have been canceled and elder care facilities and hospitals in low-lying area will be evacuated in New York today. NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg says residents in low-lying parts of the city should get out today as the transit system is planned to be shut down tomorrow.",

Trump's plan to build a border wall and make Mexico pay for it appears to be the most controversial part of the list, but it also includes immigrants who came to the US illegally as children and people who have relatives here. The Times calls it \"a potent symbol of the president's hardline position on immigration.\" In other Donald Trump news: In an interview with the Washington Post, Trump predicts that the \"silent majority\" of Americans will soon come out to vote for him. \"Something is happening in America. You may not want to see it, but something big is happening. People are sick and tired of politicians, and I\u2019m here for them,\" he says. \"I\u2019m ready to go right at the Mexican government. I'm going to charge them $25,000 per illegal immigrant and, oh, I\u2019ll make them pay.\" In a break from the immigration rhetoric that has garnered him condemnation and praise, Trump said he would have more positive results in dealing with China and Russia if he were president.

The findings suggest that the Red Planet once had a massive ocean that covered nearly half of its surface, more than a mile deep in some places, the Guardian reports. According to a NASA press release, that ocean may have been the beginnings of lakes, streams, and rivers, which would have been a good place for alien life to begin. \"Ultimately we can conclude this idea of an ocean covering Mars, which opens the idea of Martian habitability and the possibility of alien life,\" says one of the scientists from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. The study, which looked at water molecules in Mars' atmosphere using three of the most powerful telescopes in the world, found that the amount of water lost over time must have been six times greater than previously thought. The higher the concentration of deuterium, the heavier form of water left behind, the more water there used to be on Mars.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The triplets, born in October 2016, underwent a set of surgeries at just two months of age in January and are all thriving back at home, apparently not even minding their helmets, which they must wear 23 hours a day for the next six to nine months. \u201cYour skull is made up of plates, it\u2019s not a single bone,\u201d says operating surgeon David Chesler of Stony Brook Children's Hospital. If the plates fuse too early, it can \"detrimental to the brain, the vision, the life of the child. It\u2019s not imminently life-threatening, but it can cause real consequences down the road.\u201d It occurs just once in every 2,000 births, but doctors put the odds of it occurring in triplets\u2014particularly a set that isn't identical and thus not prone to the exact same malformations\u2014at one in 500 trillion, reports CBS Local.

Employees responded by opening bogus accounts for customers who didn't want them on a \"daily\" basis, she says.

The suit notes bank employees opened unauthorized accounts for customers, failed to close them when asked, and applied phony fees that hurt customers' credit. The bank says the issues stem from a few bad eggs, who have been disciplined or fired. But \"on the rare occasions when Wells Fargo did take action against its employees for unethical sales conduct, Wells Fargo further victimized its customers by failing to inform them of the breaches, refund fees they were owed, or otherwise remedy the injuries that Wells Fargo and its bankers have caused,\" the suit alleges, per the Los Angeles Times. The suit also claims bank employees robbed customer accounts of money that was used to pay fees on accounts they never wanted, while the bank placed customers in collections and added \"derogatory information\" to credit reports, Courthouse News reports. The lawsuit follows a 2013 Times investigation which described Wells Fargo employees forging customers' signatures to open unwanted accounts. In new interviews, a former employee says false accounts were opened \"daily,\" while a customer describes \"a three-year battle\" with the bank after his three accounts multiplied to 10. Per the suit: \"Wells Fargo has generated a virtual fee-generating machine, through which its customers are harmed, its employees take the blame, and Wells Fargo reaps the profit.\" LA hopes to put an end to the practices, with up to a $2,500 fine for each violation, plus refunds for customers.",

Becker's claimed post of attache for sports, culture, and humanitarian affairs \"does not exist\" in CAR records, meaning he's not an official diplomat, says Foreign Ministry chief of staff Cherubin Moroubama. What's more, the diplomatic passport issued to Becker in March, listing his post as \"financial charge de mission,\" is phony, with a serial number matching one of several stolen under a transitional government in 2014, Moroubama says, per the BBC and Guardian.

The video has since gone viral, with many commenters marveling at Hadid's lack of apparent interest in what's going on.

It's a good representation of how clueless many magazines are about how to produce good videos for the web and how equally baffled they are by nontraditional stars like Hadid, who, though a model, has become stratospherically famous for 'doing nothing,' and therefore need not\u2014and perhaps cannot\u2014entertain audiences with more conventional talents and charms.

Her conclusion: \"This is how backward our world is, now: A video of a Hadid doing nothing makes a weird sort of sense. Of course!

A shopkeeper picked them up and gave them to the grandmother of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Gilles, a 38-year-old schoolteacher, who has now donated them to the Shoah Memorial, the Holocaust museum in Paris. The dolls were among 200 items put on display Sunday, out of 19,000 objects collected by volunteers. In many cases like the L\u00e9vy sisters, they are all that remain of the deported. For two generations, Gilles' family minded the dolls. \"But nobody ever played with them,\" she told the paper. \"We knew their history.\" They tried to find out what happened to the L\u00e9vy sisters, but turned up no clues. Gilles said it seemed wrong to keep the dolls. \"We wanted to give them to a museum, or a place of memorial.\" It was difficult to let them go, she added, \"but it was the best thing we could do for the memory of those little girls.\" Over the past two years, volunteers for the Shoah Memorial criss-crossed France collecting a trove of objects belonging to those deported, including photos, a jersey emblazoned with a Star of David, a violin case, and fading slips of paper noting the Jews in hiding stacked in a little red box, reports Telerama. \"Some preferred that we borrow the objects \u2026 so they could pass them on to their children,\" Shoah curator Lior Lalieu-Smadja told Telerama. \"We understand their choice but, unfortunately, we know that quite often this evidence will be lost.\"",

The virus was found in two of 46 people collected before and after they received a blood transfusion between 1974 and 1980. Both of them \"cleared\" the virus, and researchers later found it in two more people. One had been infected for as long as five years, but both cleared it, too.

Little else is known about human hepegivirus-1, or HHpgV-1, besides that it looks a bit like hepatitis C and the harmless and perhaps beneficial human pegivirus. \"It is the first transfusion-associated virus that's been described in a long time,\" a researcher tells NBC News. He adds \"we don't know if it is going to be a significant cause of human hepatitis,\" but scientists say it's unlikely. In fact, \"it may be good for you.\" They first found the virus in blood samples from two volunteers, part of a study of 46, who received blood transfusions to treat hemophilia between 1974 and 1980. The virus only appeared after transfusions, but both patients cleared it and showed no sign of disease. Two more cases were found among 106 who'd received plasma, per mBio; both cleared the virus, though one was infected for five years. Even if the virus is harmful, researchers say there's no need to panic. \"This is not SARS. This is not MERS. This is not HIV,\" says an expert. Whereas blood transfusions were once performed solely with human blood products, they now use genetically engineered products. Plus, blood is screened more carefully and stricter policies better control who donates blood compared to 25 years ago. \"Does it cause trouble that would justify any response with blood safety? I don\u2019t think we're at that level,\" a pathologist at the Blood Systems Research Institute tells Science. Scientists have yet to isolate the virus but say the next step is to develop an antibody test to find HHpgV-1 in a larger population. Afterward, experts can determine whether those with HHpgV-1 antibodies appear less healthy than those without the virus and look for links to disease.

A round-up of coverage: Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage says the two men thought the backpack held something of value and carried it some distance before realizing it held explosive devices and calling police, NJ.com. He says in its original location near a pub, the devices could have caused carnage. \"If that pub was crowded and there was a lot of people there, it could have severely injured, killed and maimed many, many people,\" the mayor says. The AP reports that thousands of Amtrak and NJ Transit passengers were affected by the discovery of the device, with some stuck on trains for hours. Service has resumed but passengers in the area have been warned that they can expect delays Monday. NBC New York reports that investigators believe surveillance video shows the same man at two locations where explosive devices were found in Manhattan. Police aren't sure whether there is a link between the New York devices and those found in New Jersey. CNN reports that there is now an increased security presence in New York City not just because of the bombs, but because world leaders are gathering for the United Nations General Assembly. A law enforcement source tells CBS that investigators believe cell phones were used as triggers for both the Manhattan blast\u2014which NY Gov. Andrew Cuomo calls \"obviously an act of terrorism\"\u2014and the device that exploded before a New Jersey race to benefit Marines and sailors early Saturday. It's not clear whether a trigger was found with the Elizabeth devices. Bollwage says he's not sure his city was targeted. He suspects somebody may have just dumped the devices in Elizabeth, but he is \"extremely concerned for everyone in the state and country where someone can just go and drop a backpack into a garbage can that has multiple explosives in it with no timers and then you have to wonder how many people could have been hurt.\" An official close to the investigation tells Reuters that all the devices involved have been crude and the level of planning appears low\u2014but some investigators fear this was just a test. \"That's what worries us,\" he says. \"Was this some kind of test run, not just of the devices, but also of the surveillance in New York and the response?\" (The FBI says it is questioning five people found in a \"vehicle of interest.\")",

The higher risk is mainly due to the discovery of new fault zones and the possibility that multiple faults could shake at once, releasing seismic energy that results in greater destruction. The report also found that the southern part of the San Andreas Fault hasn't ruptured in more than three centuries, making it \"ready to have an earthquake because it's really locked and loaded,\" lead author Ned Field tells the Los Angeles Times. There's a 93% chance of a magnitude 7 or larger quake hitting the state in the next 30 years, and a 48% chance of one with a magnitude 7.5 or greater.

That conclusion comes thanks to fat, reports Phys.org. Ilya Bobrovskiy of Australian National University discovered a Dickinsonia fossil in 300-foot-high cliffs along the White Sea in northwest Russia, in a place so remote she reached it via helicopter.

The intermediate-range Hwasong-12 missile flew over Japan before splashing into the Pacific Ocean, reports the BBC. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called it a \"grave threat\" to his country and a clear violation of UN resolutions. Experts say the latest launch increases the likelihood of more sanctions on North Korea. \"This latest provocation will increase support in the US and among its allies to take further steps to squeeze Pyongyang and the governments and firms that do business with it,\" a director at the Eurasia Group wrote in an analysis note. The latest UN sanctions have already banned three of the top five product categories that China buys from its smaller, poorer neighbor. Meanwhile, President Trump responded to the launch with a strong statement of his own: \"North Korea disrespected the wishes of its neighbors and the world community by launching a missile today,\" he tweeted. He added that the North \"will be met with fire, fury and frankly power the likes of which the world has never seen before.\" The UN Security Council held an emergency meeting Wednesday morning.",

Probably not,\" nuclear strategy specialist Vipin Narang tells the AP. And that's exactly the calculation that gives North Korea a small shot at \"winning\" in a nuclear conflict, challenging the assumption that launching a nuclear weapon would be automatic suicide for the country. If North Korea feels threatened to the point of using a nuclear weapon, a first target would likely be a US military base in Japan; North Korea would then use its long-range nukes to threaten the US mainland and avoid a retaliatory strike. Experts say this is Kim Jong Un's \"theory of victory\"\u2014one that President Trump may be attempting to combat with an unsuccessful version of the \"madman strategy.\" Here's what else you need to know about North Korea's most-recent missile launch: Tuesday's missile launch over Japan seems likely to result in even more sanctions against North Korea. But after UN sanctions Aug. 5 targeted millions of dollars in seafood, coal, iron ore, and more, is there anything left to sanction? CNN reports two options are oil and Chinese banks. After Tuesday's missile launch, Trump said \"all options are on the table.\" This was, all things considered, a \"measured\" response from the president, according to the Atlantic. It was an official statement instead of a tweet, didn't threaten \"fire and fury,\" and avoided calling Kim Jong Un a \"wack job.\" The Guardian reports on the scary morning had by residents of Japan, who were awoken around 6am Tuesday by a government missile warning on their phones. They were given less than 10 minutes to get to a shelter or sturdy building as sirens and special broadcasts blared. The missile test impacted US markets, with the Dow dropping more than 100 points Tuesday morning, Reuters reports. The stock market would recover by the afternoon as the threat passed. Korea expert Stephan Haggard tells the Washington Post that Tuesday was another example of how \"weirdly conservative\" Kim Jong Un is\u2014carrying out provocative actions with just enough restraint to avoid an actual response. For example, pointing the missile toward Japan, not Guam. Finally, Russia's deputy foreign minister blamed the US and South Korea for Tuesday's nuclear test and came out against further sanctions against North Korea, saying they haven't prevented missile tests in the past and won't in the future, Newsweek reports.",

In other developments: Timothy Vail was the last man to escape from a New York prison, according to the New York Daily News, and he says he hopes Matt and Sweat can avoid capture. He tells the Daily News that he hopes they \"stay out of sight and don't commit any new crimes.\" Vail, who raped and murdered a pregnant woman in 1988, injured himself while escaping from the Elmira Correctional Facility in 2003 and was recaptured within two days after he and a fellow fugitive stole a van.

The former chief of police in North Tonawanda, near where Matt grew up, says he's around the same age as the 48-year-old and that long before Matt's first arrest, he had a \"fearsome\" reputation and was known for terrorizing other kids on the school bus. An officer in Tonawanda tells the paper that in 1986\u201411 years before his arrest for a gruesome local murder\u2014Matt broke out of a correctional facility and was recaptured a few days later.

Researchers at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development at Harvard and the National Institutes of Health looked at data from more than 15,000 women who had no history of illness before pregnancy and had not had gestational diabetes before. Every four years, the women filled out a questionnaire about the kinds of foods they had eaten in the previous year, ranging from \"never\" to \"six or more times a day,\" and were asked if they'd consumed baked, boiled, mashed, or chips. The study tracked 21,693 pregnancies and 854 cases of gestational diabetes over a 10-year period. The risk was 50% higher for women who consumed two to four servings of potatoes a week. Researchers say women who switched to vegetables or whole grains at least twice a week were 10% less likely to develop gestational diabetes. Previous research has shown a link between diabetes and a high glycemic index, but this is the first study to show an association between potato consumption before pregnant and the risk of the condition, which can lead to diabetes during pregnancy. \"Our findings are biologically plausible, though the detailed underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated,\" the lead researcher tells CBS News.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 If your short-term plan involves getting pregnant, your immediate plan should potentially be to lay off the potatoes. So suggests a National Institutes of Health study published Tuesday in the BMJ that found women who eat more potatoes before becoming pregnant may be more likely to develop gestational diabetes as compared to their spud-light counterparts. That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap. The researchers estimate that trading two servings of potatoes weekly for a substitute vegetable, legumes, or whole-grain food would reduce the risk of gestational diabetes\u2014which CBS reports affects as many as 8% of pregnancies\u2014by 9% to 12%. As for why women should care, Zhang tells the BBC that women with gestational diabetes can develop pre-eclampsia and hypertension, which \"can adversely affect the fetus\" and put the mother at higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. The team notes, however, that the study shows correlation, not causation, and says more research is needed. (One country has told its women not to get pregnant right now.)",

In the video, Stodden says, \"Alright, here's the first,\" as she shakes the test. \"Come on, here we go honey,\" her husband says. \"Honey, how you feeling?\" She responds, \"A little overwhelmed.\" The video was sent to \"close friends and family,\" Stodden's estranged mother, Krista Keller, tells Fox. \"If it wasn't for media I would not get to know the news about my daughter's pregnancy.\" Stodden also revealed on last night's episode of The Mother/Daughter Experiment: Celebrity Edition that she was \"half a virgin\" when she met Hutchison. \"That's why we separated when I was 19, because I was too young at the time,\" she said. \"I was partying. Hooking up with other men?\" Krista's response? \"Of course!\" Courtney said about her mom's feelings for Doug, \"She'd say, 'My garden isn't being watered by my husband, and I just love you.'

But some things are out of your control.\" (As Fox News notes, a source had been circulating video husband Doug Hutchison apparently shot showing Stodden with a positive pregnancy test.) Stodden, now 21, was 16 when she married Hutchison, who is 34 years older than she is. Stodden, whose Twitter account is totally terrific, went on Couples Therapy with her husband in 2012, the year after they wed; they separated in 2013 and got back together in 2014. This year, Stodden went on Lifetime's The Mother/Daughter Experiment: Celebrity Edition with her mother, where it was revealed that, among other things, Stodden had cheated on Hutchison before their separation\u2014and that Stodden's mom was also in love with Hutchison. Apparently things still aren't going well between Stodden and her mom, because her mother told Fox that \"if it wasn't for the media I would not get to know the news about my daughter's pregnancy.\" (Anderson Cooper's impression of Stodden will definitely make you feel better.)",

Many of the people who have racked up nearly 3 million views of the video that shows Detective Jeff Payne arresting University of Utah Hospital nurse Alex Wubbels would likely agree. Gill on Friday called for a criminal investigation into the encounter, in which Payne handcuffed a screaming Wubbels after she refused to permit a blood draw from an unconscious patient\u2014as she was right to do, according to law, because Payne had neither a warrant nor the consent of the patient, who was not under arrest. The Salt Lake Tribune reports Payne was put on administrative leave Friday afternoon, along with a second unnamed officer connected to the July 26 incident. More: Mayor Jackie Biskupski and Chief Mike Brown both called Wubbels to apologize. Per the city, the Unified Police Department will begin a criminal probe into the matter, and an internal affairs investigation will be conduced as well. The Tribune also offers more background on the patient in question: William Gray, a 43-year-old who was driving a semi when a 26-year-old who was trying to evade the Utah Highway Patrol crashed into Gray head-on. That driver was killed, and a police official explains it's typical to get blood draws of those involved in fatal crashes, even if they aren't suspected of wrongdoing. The AP cites Payne's police report, in which he wrote he was trying to avoid a \"scene\" by taking Wubbels outside and that this his boss told him to arrest her if she didn't cooperate with the draw. Wubbels' attorney says the nurse was left in a hot police car for 20 minutes before the detective realized the hospital had already drawn the patient's blood as part of treatment. The Tribune notes that while the video may suggest Payne was demanding Wubbels draw Gray's blood, Payne is actually one of a handful of officers certified to draw blood in accident cases, and was looking to draw the blood himself.",

The iSight report notes that \"memory scraping capabilities has been available in the Russian-language underground for some time\" and that \"cyber criminals in Brazil have used the technique since at least 2009.\" Neiman Marcus, meanwhile, says that \"some of our customers' payment cards were used fraudulently after making purchases at our stores. We have taken steps to notify those affected customers for whom we have contact information.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It looks like the hackers that hit Target had lots of other, well, targets. The Department of Homeland Security recently sent retailers and financial service companies a secret memo warning that the Target hit appeared to be part of a larger international campaign, the Wall Street Journal reports, an insight gleaned with the help of Dallas cybersecurity firm iSight Partners. Yesterday, iSight released its own report, saying that a virus it's calling KAPTOXA \"has potentially infected a large number of retail information systems\"\u2014and noting that the \"intrusion operators displayed innovation and a high degree of skill,\" particularly in terms of the \"operational sophistication\" of the hack. The Journal shares this feature by way of example: The virus focused on stealing data during the peak hours of 10am and 5pm; the data was housed in a Target server that the hackers later accessed. The virus attacks point-of-sale systems in a way that is \"new to eCrime,\" subverting traditional efforts to protect consumer data, the report warns, according to NBC. Parts of the code, which is impervious to all known antivirus software, have been online since last spring. It's partly in Russian, which US officials think may indicate a link to organized crime in the former Soviet Union. The finding follows reports of similar breaches at Neiman Marcus. That breach had gone unnoticed since July, the New York Times reports today; Neiman's system was only fully secured Sunday.",

Others point the finger at Trump's extremely busy schedule in the days before the debate and too many people (up to a dozen, some with not much political acumen) giving him conflicting suggestions. Sources say his debate training was \"unconventional,\" with Trump unable to concentrate during more traditional sessions and preferring to simply dish with advisers rather than have mock debates. Trump himself told Fox News he found it hard to segue into some of those challenges against Clinton on the debate stage, such as the subject of Benghazi. Trump's pulling back\u2014he stopped attacking Clinton and even grew \"subdued\" as the debate proceeded\u2014has got to change the next time around, frustrated aides say. Instead, he has to set Clinton's vulnerabilities in his sights and stick to his plan for the whole night. \"It clearly looked like he ran out of gas after 30 minutes [in the New York debate], and that came through loud and clear,\" a senior political strategist tells the Times.",

Currently, there's no treatment for right heart failure, which occurs when the left side of the heart fails, and the only treatment for left heart failure is a transplant. The new study, published in Cell Research, shows that a protein called Cardiotrophin 1 causes heart muscle cells to grow in a healthy way and stimulates blood vessel growth, \"just like what you would see with exercise and pregnancy,\" says Dr. Lynn Megeney, senior author of the study and a professor at the University of Ottawa. When heart cells are treated with CT-1, they become longer, healthier fibers, while those treated with a drug called phenylephrine (PE) just grow wider. When CT-1 treatment stops, the heart goes back to its original condition, just like it does when exercise or pregnancy end. \"An intriguing aspect of this research was how human CT1 was able to promote a healthy growth response in multiple animal models,\" says a co-author. \"This suggests the action of CT1 is universally conserved and puts us much closer to therapy.\" The researchers say that two weeks of treatment with a pump-like device called a mini-pump improved blood flow in mice and rats for about two months, and they say it could be ready for clinical trials in two or three years. Heart failure is the leading cause of death and disability in high-income countries.",

According to a study in Cell Research, the Ottawa researchers discovered that protein cardiotrophin 1 (CT1) can fuel healthy heart growth, repair heart damage, and cause the heart to pump more blood in cases of left heart failure, as a result of heart attack, and right heart failure, as a result of high blood pressure in the lungs, reports Medical News Today. It's a big deal since medications used to treat left heart failure don't work on right heart failure, which usually requires a heart transplant, per a release. Exercise can be beneficial because it boosts the heart's ability to pump blood, but \"people with heart failure usually can't exercise,\" researcher Lynn Megeney tells the Ottawa Citizen. The heart usually responds by expanding, irreversibly, in an unhealthy way. But that's why CT1 is \"very exciting,\" Megeney says. It \"causes heart muscles to grow in a more healthy way and it also stimulates blood vessel growth in the heart,\" increasing blood flow just like with exercise. And just like with exercise, the heart returns to its original size afterward. Megeney says the discovery could lead to fewer heart transplants, but he says it could be two or three years before researchers begin clinical trials on humans and, assuming they go well, a decade before treatment is available to the public.

James Vogts, lawyer for Remington, says the company is protected by the 2005 Lawful Commerce in Arms Act that shields gun makers from liability in shootings. \"No matter how much we wished those children and teachers were still alive, the law needs to be applied,\" Vogts told justices.

On Oct. 18, 1988, the Icelandic climbers set off on an expedition to Pumori, a 23,500-foot-tall mountain in the Himalayas near Nepal's border with Tibet. A helicopter search was launched five days after the men were last seen, but no sign of them was found until last month, when a mountaineer found their remains at the end of a glacier below the climb route, which suggests they fell into the crevasse at its base. The men were considered leading exponents of Himalayan climbing at the time and were well known for their open, easy-going personalities, the Telegraph reports. \"I've never felt as alone as the day I arrived back at our high camp,\" climber Steve Aisthorpe tells the Guardian. \"As I worked my way upwards, I desperately hoped that Kristinn and Torsteinn had descended safely and were now lying in their sleeping bags in the tiny red tent camp.

Aisthorpe, who the Guardian notes found out just a few weeks ago his friends' bodies had been seen at the end of a glacier on Pumori mountain, recalls on the Church of Scotland's website how his group started as four climbers in October of that year, though one of the men fell ill early on and dropped out. Aisthorpe, then 26, came down with the flu, and so he climbed back down on Oct. 16, 1988, to seek medical attention. When Aisthorpe realized he was in no condition to attempt the climb, he sent a message back to Runarsson and Gudjonsson, both 27 and from Iceland: \"Feel free\" to go for the summit without him.

But with the new Airbus A350 XWB\u2014the first aircraft to land in the US last week\u2014the airline says it has come up with a solution, Wired reports. \"The design process was about optimization, pushing the constraints, and opening up the box of solutions,\" says Alain De Zotti, chief engineer of the plane's program. Among the improvements: bigger wings (about 20% bigger than previous generations of planes), wider seats (about 10% wider), and LED lights that change color to mimic the sun's natural glow. The filtering system changes the air in the plane every two to three minutes to keep air from stale, and the cabin is pressurized to 6,000 feet, which makes it easier for passengers to move down the aisles. The A350 also comes with more room for larger passenger seats in economy class, just an extra inch over the standard width. \"Business class is now like first class was, and first class is like little apartments,\" DeZotti says. The plane is also lighter, with more than 50% of the structure made from carbon fiber-reinforced plastic, which is less susceptible to corrosion than aluminum, Wired notes. The wings are 20% bigger. For one thing, the plane has a filter that keeps the air fresh for two or three minutes\u2014that's enough time to adjust to the difference in altitude between your destination and the airport where you're headed.

Another factor: Because of the planes' relatively light frames, they can be pressurized to 6,000 feet, which the airline says allows for more humidity and makes the air pressure inside the aircraft closer to the pressure on the ground than is the case with most jets, per Quartz. A third factor is the jet's filtration system, which replaces the air in the cabin in its entirety every two to three minutes. The idea there is that, if nothing else, the improved air quality should help people sleep better on long flights. And the big question: Has it worked? It's a little too early to tell.

But some people take the vitamin, which is also found in vitamins A, C, and D, and end up with acne, reports LiveScience. So researchers set out to find out why. Their findings, published today in Science Translational Medicine, could eventually lead to better treatments for acne. \"It has been reported several times that people who take B12 develop acne,\" says Huiying Li, a molecular pharmacologist at the University of California-Los Angeles and a co-author of the study. \"So it\u2019s exciting that we found that the potential link between B12 and acne is through the skin bacteria.\" Li's team found that people taking B12 have high levels of Propionibacterium acnes, the bacteria that causes acne. The vitamin lowers the bacteria's production of B12, which causes it to produce more porphyrins, which are also linked to inflammation. \"The main message is that skin bacteria are important,\" says Li. \"They're contributing members of our skin's society, and they like to do things in a certain way.\"",

It seems that the vitamin changes the way skin bacteria behaves, which promotes inflammation, which in turn leads to pimples. Some people are more vulnerable than others. \"This study does present some compelling evidence suggesting that supplementation with B12 can cause or exacerbate acne in a subset of individuals,\" says a co-author of the study. She emphasizes that the research shows correlation, not causation.

It's what they prescribe.\" But the EpiPen's name is now in the crosshairs after drugmaker Mylan jacked up the cost of the life-saving device by 500% over the past eight years, reports the New York Times. Mylan acquired the device in 2007 and has been steadily raising the price ever since, even as it has spent tens of millions on TV ads to shore up the Epi Pen's names. \"It\u2019s a totally established brand name with little competition,\" says the expert. \"That gives them freedom to raise the price every year.\" But critics say that's unfair to patients, especially those who rely on the device for life-threatening allergic reactions. For example, a family of four that relies on EpiPen to keep their 4-year-old healthy can't afford the full cost, even with a $100 off coupon offered by Mylan. \"I don't know any family that doesn't have EpiPen,\" one doctor tells the Times. The increases are among the biggest of any top-selling brand drug, according to DRX, a unit of Connecture that tracks drug pricing.

But drugmaker Mylan has hiked the price of the device by nearly 500% over the past few years, CBS News reports, and parents and doctors aren't happy. \"When epinephrine only costs a few cents, but they're going up to $500, personally I don't think that's ethically responsible,\" allergy specialist Dr. Douglas McMahon told NBC News. \u201cPatients are calling and saying they can't afford it.\u201d (McMahon is seeking FDA approval for his own device that he says will cost $50.) Twice in her seven years, Ellie Henegar\u2019s life was saved with an EpiPen, but her parents were stunned last year when the bill came to $600, they told CBS. Compare that to 2009, when the bill was about $100 for the same two-pack of EpiPen. While insurance covers varying degrees of the cost, not everyone is lucky enough to have a plan that does, NBC notes. With a near monopoly, Mylan has little incentive to cut the price, Bloomberg reports. In fact, Mylan execs considered dumping the aging product in 2007. Instead, they launched a marketing campaign that turned the device into an essential, donating EpiPens to schools and dropping $35 million on TV ads. A law passed by Congress in 2013 requiring schools to stock epinephrine devices also boosted sales, which last year totaled $1 billion. Mylan contends it has made a \"significant investment\" to improve the device and offers coupons. \"It's a totally established brand name with little competition,\" Bloomberg\u2019s Robert Langreth tells CBS. \"That gives them freedom to raise the price every year.\"",

Researchers had volunteers rate comments made by officers during the traffic stops in terms of respectfulness and more, per the Los Angeles Times. The BBC reports respectful behavior by officers included apologizing, showing an interest in the person, and saying \"drive safely.\" Disrespectful behavior included asking questions, calling the person \"bro\" or \"man,\" and using words that have a negative connotation. The study found officers were 57% more likely to use one of the most respectful phrases with white people and 61% more likely to use one of the most disrespectful phrases with black people. For example, white people were more likely to be called \"sir\" or \"ma'am,\" while black people were more likely to be called by their first names. Officers were also found to be less polite, formal, friendly, and impartial with black people. The race of the officer didn't appear to change things. \"These routine interactions are important,\" researcher Jennifer Eberhardt says, per the BBC. \"They're the way most people encounter the police.\" And if those encounters go poorly, citizens may become less supportive or cooperative toward police.

PepsiCo agreed to pull BVO from Gatorade last year, and now Powerade bottles in strawberry lemonade and fruit punch flavors in several cities don't have the ingredient listed. Some bottles still list it, and Coca-Cola said today that Powerade is \"BVO-free,\" so it seems the company is phasing it out. Just what is BVO? According to the FDA, it's used in fruit-flavored drinks as a stabilizer for flavoring oils. But Bromine is a patented flame retardant that's banned in the European Union and Japan, and may be harmful to anyone who drinks it in large amounts, the Telegram reports. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo aren't the only companies under pressure from petitions: Subway yanked an FDA-approved ingredient known as the \"yoga mat chemical\" from its breads earlier this year when a petitioner at FoodBabe.com challenged the company's healthy-food image.",

Researchers looked at data going back to 1979 and found that 58.3% of newborns were circumcised in 2010, down from 64.5% in 1979 and the lowest rate since the report's inception, reports the New York Times. While the American Academy of Pediatrics still recommends that male newborns be circumcised, the CDC report notes that \"circumcision rates fluctuated during this period, generally declining during the 1980s, rising in the 1990s, and declining again in the early years of the 21st century.\" The biggest drops were seen in the Midwest (from 82.9% in 1998 to 68.8% in 2009) and South (from 53.8% in 1988 to 66.1% in 1995), while the West saw a 37% decrease from 63.9% in 1979 to 40.2% in 2010. The lead author of the report, which was published in the Journal of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, tells the Times that while there's no evidence that male circumcision leads to increased risk of circumcision-related diseases such as herpes and urinary tract infections, \"there is some evidence that it does increase the risk of these diseases.\" In Denmark, meanwhile, parliament is considering a ban on male circumcision.",

That's not to say the doctors' group is calling for a ban, which it says it weighed and decided against due to cases where male circumcision is medically necessary and for the potential for clandestine botched procedures, says Moller. Had they wanted a ban, they'd possibly face a steep slope. In a June report to the UN, Denmark agreed with Egypt's stance that it is a parental right to circumcise one's male child, reports the Copenhagen Post. Still, the Local reports that 74% of respondents to a 2014 survey said they'd support a full or partial ban. An estimated 1,000 to 2,000 circumcisions take place in Denmark each year, and the country should have a firmer idea of that number as of Jan. 1, after which all circumcisions must be logged in Denmark's national patient registry, reports the Local. Doctors who fail to do so will be fined, reports the Post. The CDC reports that in 2010, an estimated 58% of male newborns were circumcised in the US.

The Guardian reports on the \"Self-Managed Abortion: Safe and Supported\" portal, or SASS, set up by Women Help Women. Through it, 23 trained counselors will answer questions and give advice if women have already decided to take the drug misoprostol. The medication, which, when taken alone or in combination with mifepristone, keeps a pregnancy from happening, is only legal in the US at medical facilities, though it can be purchased OTC in Central American nations. A Women Help Women rep says the idea for the site came about after a Guardian story documenting a Texas woman's trip to Mexico to get the drug, and all the questions she had once she got it. The site won't provide pills, and organizers say they won't even suggest women take them\u2014they're just there to keep women safe if they've already decided to. \"It's worse to just remain silent,\" says a UC San Francisco obstetrics professor who calls misoprostol a \"very safe and effective\" drug (though it's more effective taken with mifepristone, which isn't as easy to obtain). For women who do have complications and must seek medical care, the Washington Post notes they'll be advised that drug-induced and spontaneous abortions typically look the same, and that the drug isn't detectable via drug test. Abortion foes note the meds can be dangerous if not taken correctly or if taken late in the gestation period, and that this site could put women at risk by providing info on taking them. Women Help Women is being cautious in case of legal ramifications: Its servers are located outside the US, as are its two dozen or so staffers.",

The surgery is scheduled to take place within a week to 10 days. If her family's claim that she weighs more than 1,100 pounds is true, it would make her the heaviest woman alive.

And there may be repercussions: In it, he dismissed the work of UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, saying, \"Everyone who comes to Syria knows that Syria accepts advice, but not orders,\" and the New York Times predicts such remarks might cause Brahimi to wash his hands of the conflict. That would present the US and other \"Friends of Syria\" with a quandary: Get more involved, or potentially watch the conflict continue indefinitely. And though celebratory gunfire rang out afterward, even some loyalists were unimpressed. \"It sounded more like gloating than making promises,\" one Assad supporter tells Reuters. \"Everything he suggests now, it is too late.

Now Australian researchers say they've found a long-term cure that will allow children with peanut allergies to eat peanuts without fear, the Guardian reports. \"These children have been eating peanut freely in their diet without having to follow any particular program of peanut intake in the years after treatment was completed,\" says lead researcher Mimi Tang. \"This changes sufferers' lives. They can now eat peanuts. Their lives change completely.\" In a clinical trial involving 42 children, 82% of those given a combination of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus with peanut protein in increasing amounts were cured of their allergy at the end of 2013. A follow-up study four years later found 80% of the cured children were still showing no signs of allergic reaction to peanuts. Tang says the treatment combines a high dose of the bacteria with peanut flour, which encourages the immune system to gradually tolerate larger and larger doses of peanut flour. \"Probiotics are very potent immune-modulating agents to shift the way the immune systems responds,\" Tang says. \"It creates an environment for the immune System to respond differently.\" She hopes a product can be on the market, the New York Times reports.",

Here's what you need to know: The House has already passed a bill to fund the government through Dec. 15, and John Boehner is pushing for a delay in the new health care law for a year and a repeal of the medical device tax that is part of it, reports the Wall Street Journal. Senate Democrats have said they won't accept any changes to the health law, and President Obama has said he'll veto any bill that includes such a measure. But the Journal notes that Republicans believe they have the votes in the Senate to get rid of the tax. If that happens, the Senate could pass a short-term spending bill for a week or so, and then pressure both parties to reach a deal in the coming days. Harry Reid has been pushing hard for a deal, but Politico reports that he privately urged Obama not to hold a meeting with the four congressional leaders ahead of the deadline. Washington, DC, is home to the largest concentration of federal workers in the nation, and if the government shuts down tonight\u2014as expected\u2014that could cost the region $200 million a day, and more than 700,000 jobs, the Washington Post reports. \"This is serious,\" says the director of George Mason University's Center for Regional Analysis. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House\u2014but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight\u2014which appears to be the likeliest scenario\u2014the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month\u2014and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon\u2014but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day\u2014and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University\u2019s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

Bellingcat suspects the mission that spurred that honor was a secret one; while most recipients' heroics are described in detail, Chepiga simply received his award \"by decree from the Russian president.\" As for how the alleged identification came to be, Bellingcat explains a source suggested it look at whether the men could have attended the Far Eastern Military Command Academy, which had \"the best reputation for foreign-language training and overseas clandestine operations.\" It came upon a photo that it thought could be Boshirov and continued its web searching, which ultimately led it to Chepiga's name and passport file. A 2003 photo in the file \"strongly resembled a younger 'Boshirov.'\" The BBC had this to say: \"British officials have not commented. The BBC understands there is no dispute over the identification.\"",

Esmond Bradley Martin, 75, was alone in his house when his wife found him with a stab wound to the neck, the BBC reports. Police are investigating the circumstances but suspect it was a botched robbery. Martin, an American geographer, had spent decades risking his life to secretly photograph and document illegal sales of ivory and rhinoceros horn, traveling to China, Vietnam, and Laos to pose as a buyer and establish the details of black market prices. He first went to Kenya from the US in the 1970s when there was a surge in the number of elephants being killed for their ivory. His last report, Decline in the Legal Ivory Trade in China in Anticipation of a Ban, was published by conservation group Save the Elephants last year. His wife, who reported the death, said she found her husband's lifeless body after coming from a painstaking nature walk at around 4pm. \"We have already questioned a gardener and a cook who are employed at the home,\" Nairobi DCI boss Ireri Kamwende said. (An anti-smuggling expert was recently murdered.)",

The 75-year-old had a stab wound to his neck, and investigators believe his death was the result of a robbery gone wrong. His wife says she went out for a nature walk and discovered his body upon returning home around 4pm Sunday, per the Star. Bradley Martin, identifiable by a colorful handkerchief he often had peeking out of his jacket pocket, was a major figure within the wildlife conservation movement who'd risen to prominence by going undercover, usually posing as a buyer, to expose the illegal market for ivory and rhino horn. A former UN special envoy for rhino conservation, Bradley Martin began his efforts in earnest in the 1970s, when the number of elephants being slaughtered for their ivory spiked. That's when he left the US for Kenya, and his work helped put an end to the sales of rhino horn and ivory in China. His travels also took him to Vietnam and Laos, where last year he and another researcher revealed the latter country's ivory trade was the fastest growing in the world. Their work there involved the dangerous ploy of pretending they were buyers and staying in a casino frequented by organized-crime members and traffickers, all so they could find out what the going price for ivory was. Local police say they've already questioned a cook and gardener at Bradley Martin's home and have come up empty so far on suspects.",

But she says she also regretted her action after a few days. \"I firmly believe in this job. I'm proud to do it and we serve the office of the president,\" she says, noting her personal feelings toward Trump will not get in the way of her duties. Her comments may, however. A Secret Service rep tells CNN that it is \"taking quick and appropriate action\" after the Department of Homeland Security's Office of the Inspector General reportedly received at least one complaint. Critics have suggested O'Grady should be fired, per USA Today.",

Doctors Without Borders, the only aid organization treating people with the disease, said it was \"overwhelmed\" by the crisis and couldn't send workers to new outbreak sites without getting more resources. Here's what you need to know about Ebola, the current outbreak, and why it's so deadly: Ebola is rare and very deadly. Since the first outbreak in 1976, Ebola viruses have infected roughly 2,400 people and killed about one-third of them. Symptoms can come on very quickly and kill fast: \"Ebola is more inimical to humans than perhaps any known virus on Earth, except rabies and HIV-1. And it does its damage much faster than either.\" Why this particular outbreak so deadly? First, this outbreak concerns the most deadly of the five Ebola viruses\u2014the Zaire ebolavirus, which has killed 79% of those it has infected. (The virus is called that after the formerly named Zaire, which, along with Sudan, experienced the first Ebola outbreak back in 1976.) The current outbreak is centered in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, and most of\u2014President Trump's travel ban on six Muslim-majority countries has sparked a debate about religious freedom in the US. \"It's not a religious freedom issue.

So far more than 390 people have died in the outbreak, which is stretching across Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, Bloomberg reports. That far exceeds the 280 killed when the disease debuted in 1976. \"This epidemic is out of control,\" a Doctors Without Borders official said this week, according to the Guardian. This outbreak is proving especially deadly because it involves the most devastating of the five Ebola viruses; Zaire ebolavirus kills 79% of those infected, Vox explains. It's also the first major outbreak to hit West Africa, and workers there aren't sure how to deal with it\u2014many hospitals, for example, are releasing infected patients. Among the general populace, education is even worse. In Sierra Leone, for instance, young people have burned drugs and supplies, believing that it was the medicine killing the patients. At its meeting next week, the WHO will seek to form a multi-country team to close that information gap. On the bright side, \"the chance of Ebola spreading out of West Africa is very, very low,\" one specialist tells NPR\u2014although if it did it would likely hit Paris next, because 10% of Guinea's air traffic out of its Conakry airport heads there.",

Three doctors from East Flanders are being investigated on suspicion of having \"poisoned\" Tine Nys in 2010. The 38-year-old had been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome two months before she died in an apparently legal killing by a doctor. Sophie Nys, one of Tine's sisters, told the AP of \"irregularities\" in the process: that the doctor who performed the euthanasia asked her parents to hold the needle in place while he administered the fatal injection, among other fumbling efforts. Afterward, the doctor asked the family to use a stethoscope to confirm that Tine's heart had stopped. Last year, the AP reported that after Nys' family filed a criminal complaint, her doctors attempted to block the investigation. \"We must try to stop these people,\" wrote Dr. Lieve Thienpont, the psychiatrist who approved Nys' request to die\u2014and one of the doctors now facing charges. \"It is a seriously dysfunctional, wounded, traumatized family with very little empathy and respect for others.\" Nys also alleged that her sister's longtime psychiatrist wouldn't give Tine the OK, and that Thienpoint did so after as few as two or three sessions with her.

Data has revealed that the cumulative amount of radioactive particles released into the atmosphere had reached levels that apply to a Level 7 incident, reports the AP. So what is that estimate? According to two estimates, the equivalent of about 500,000 terabecquerels of radiation from iodine-131 has been released. The Level 7 threshold is \"several tens of thousands of terabecquerels.\" But all 7s are not created alike: The Wall Street Journal notes that officials were careful to say this this is still not a Chernobyl-size disaster. \"The amount of released radiation is about a tenth of Chernobyl\"\u2014about 5.2 million terabecquerels\u2014said a rep for Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency. But it could still top Chernobyl in one regard: TEPCO today warned that the plant continues to release radioactive materials, and that the total levels emitted could eventually top those released by Chernobyl. Level 7 also indicates widespread effects on the environment and health: The Telegraph noted that Japan's safety commission now says radiation in excess of the amount considered safe for humans during an entire year has been found as far as 37 miles from the plant; the evacuation zone is only 18 miles. Is there another big one we haven't been talking about? Sort of. Besides Chernobyl, Time notes that a 1957 accident in Kyshtym, Russia, was the only one that's come close to being a 7; it was a 6.

The disease, which is spread by bacteria, is \"highly prevalent and is estimated to have resulted in the mortality of millions of coral,\" the DEP says in a press release. \"The exact cause and contributing factors for this event will likely take years to identify; however, addressing other known coral stressors (i.e., water quality, turbidity, and sedimentation, etc.) will increase the ability of the corals to recover.\" The outbreak began in 2014 near Key Biscayne in Miami-Dade County. By fall 2015, the disease had spread to 55 linear miles of reef, including locations as far north as Pompano Beach in Broward County and as far south as Biscayne National Park with a few isolated reports in Palm Beach County. Disease continued to spread north and south into the Florida Keys throughout 2016, and by summer of 2017 reports of widespread disease were confirmed as far northern as St. Lucie Inlet in Martin County and to the southern boundary of the upper Keys. In 2018, the disease front reached Looe Key. Scientists are using DNA analysis to try to identify the pathogens involved. \"Anything from ... looking at chlorine-laced epoxy as an antiseptic, and even looking at how antibiotics interact with the disease,\" Erinn Muller, the lab's science director, tells NPR. \"Because if it is bacterial, then antibiotics would be.\" Researchers at the Mote Marine Lab have raised more than 35,000 lab-raised corals in an effort to prevent the spread of coral bleaching from the bleaching. \"Before we lose the reefs from the coral from the entire reefs, which can provide valuable educational educational educational learn about the sport sport sport how fish and how how fish, which what what what how how how a sport, which which a sport ... which can learn the learn how learn how how learn a sport a sport.",

As the third-largest barrier reef in the world, the 360-mile stretch of vitally important sea life provides a buffet of nutrients for plants and animals along the state's Atlantic coast. Now, scientists are racing to find a cure, as detailed in a piece by NPR. To be sure, reefs are struggling worldwide, and coral diseases have been rising over the last decade, per NOAA, probably caused by pollution and rising ocean temperatures, which provide a warm home for pathogens. But growing swathes of coral from as far north as Pompano Beach in Broward County to as far south as Biscayne National Park are turning into watery graveyards, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection says in a report. Since 2015 the department has been working with a team of federal, state, and local groups to identify the likely pathogen, find a treatment, and address underlying problems\u2014but that identification hasn't yet happened. Scientist William Precht, who was hired by the state to monitor the health of reefs off the port of Miami, has watched the disease move from one patch of coral to another. He says that whatever is killing the coral is especially deadly for brain and star coral, which create the underlying structure for many reefs. The death of the coral, he tells NPR, is having a lasting impact. \"When you go out and swim on the reefs of Miami-Dade County today, it would be a very rare chance encounter that you'd see some of these three or four species.\" (There's bad news about the Great Barrier Reef, too.)",

The suit, which the AP notes was filed on behalf of several groups, says the proposed 85% reduction at Bears Ears is an \"extreme overreach in authority\" and puts at risk dinosaur fossils and Native American artifacts, among other resources. Patagonia owner Yvon Chouinard told CNN of his litigious plans earlier this week, noting, \"This government is evil, and I'm not going to sit back and let evil win.\" President Obama designated Bears Ears a national monument at the end of 2016; Grand Staircase-Escalante received the protection 20 years earlier from President Clinton. At the heart of the commotion is whether a current president can walk back a former president's creation of a national monument under the Antiquities Act, with Native American tribes, environmental groups, and paleontologists arguing that Trump doesn't have the authority to do so; two legal experts interviewed by the AP had varying opinions on the matter.

Previous research has indicated that we yawn after our body temperatures rise. The study found that people's age, sex, and previous night's sleep, on the other hand, didn't have much of an effect on our yawning patterns. All this talk of temperature still fits the idea that we yawn when sleepy, ninemsn notes. Tiredness, stress, and a lack of stimulation can have an effect on our brain temperatures.",

Clinton will be introduced by Elizabeth Warren, who's locked in possibly the nation's most competitive Senate race against Scott Brown. \"I'm going to talk about what I've talked about for years now,\" Warren told ABC last month. \"America's middle class is getting hammered and Washington is rigged to work for the big guy.\" It's worth noting that Brown didn't speak at the RNC.

A number of CEOs are also on the docket, ready to affirm that an Obama presidency would indeed be good for business, the AP reports. Tonight will also mark Obama's official nomination. Since he ran essentially unopposed in the primary, this will simply be a roll-call of all the states, scheduled for after Clinton's speech.

A jury ruled Richard John Bingham, now 87, the killer and declared him dead in 1999, but Bingham has been trying to get a death certificate for his father since 2014 under a new law that came into effect in 2014, USA Today reports.

He allegedly shot himself in the head, then fed the body to a tiger named Zorra. But a man who claims to be a family friend says he was told by a fellow gambler that Lucan never left the country and took his own life.

The BBC recalls the crime: Sandra Rivett was beaten to death in the family's London home and her body left in the basement; Lord Lucan's estranged wife was also attacked but got away, fleeing to a neighboring pub and yelling \"He\u2019s in the house! He\u2019s murdered the nanny!\" per the Times. Lady Lucan named her then 39-year-old husband as the attacker, saying he had thought she was Rivett, reports USA Today. A June 1975 inquest named him as Rivett's murderer, except the man born Richard John Bingham was never officially seen again after that night; a car he had borrowed from a friend was later found, blood-stained and abandoned. The sightings and theories kept flowing, though: in Melbourne, Australia, and France within the first year; employed as a waiter in San Francisco; backpacking on Mount Etna; dying in Goa in 1996. Just last Saturday came a story from an old gambling friend, who says he was told that the lord shot himself and had his body fed to a tiger. Lucan was declared dead in 1996, but the rub was that son George Bingham was unable to take on his title, preventing him from assuming his father's seat in the House of Lords.

Interestingly, the study found no difference between male and female children, but it did find a racial disparity, notes Medical Daily. Adult black children felt their mother's disappointment more acutely than their white counterparts. Researchers hypothesize that sibling rivalry may be behind the depression, meaning more attention or support from mom doesn't necessarily beat out the negative attention from jealous siblings. Or that the favorites are more often asked to help the aging mother, which is its own source of stress. (The adult children in the study had mothers who were 65 to 75 when interviewed.) And yet a third possibility is posed by Bustle: A mother's attention may naturally drift toward the weakest or most sensitive child, thus her favoritism doesn't necessarily cause depression.

All research subjects reported some degree of craving for alcohol after viewing the images, and less craving after reciting anAA prayer. MRI data revealed that there were changes in parts of the prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain that controls attention, and in brain sites responsible for control of emotion and the semantic reappraisal of emotion, which represents the different ways a people understand situations based on their perspectives. \"This finding suggests that there appears to be an emotional\" response, says Galanter.",

Pittsburgh dentist Alfonso A. Costa pleaded guilty to a felony count of healthcare fraud after an FBI probe into his oral surgery practice found he had charged for procedures he never performed. Though the crime carries a potential sentence of up to 10 years in federal prison, Costa was able to avoid prison time after Carson helped petition a federal judge for leniency. \"We became friends about a decade ago because we discovered that we were so much alike and shared the same values and principles that govern our lives,\" Carson told the judge.

Wreckage was reported to be spread over a large area and it was unclear if there were any casualties among people on the ground. Russian state television aired a video of the crash site, showing parts of the wreckage in the snow. Russia has experienced record snowfalls in recent days and visibility was reportedly poor. The flight-tracking site Flightradar24 tweeted that the seven-year-old passenger jet had gone into a steep descent five minutes after takeoff, after which it had vanished from radars.

The cause: Way too early to tell. Investigators are looking into weather conditions (it was about 23 degrees Fahrenheit), human error, and the technical condition of the Antonov An-148 airliner, reports Reuters. But Russia's Investigative Committee wasn't ruling anything out at this point, reports the AP. After takeoff: The plane went down shortly after takeoff from Domodedovo Airport en route to Orsk, about 1,000 miles southeast of Moscow. Fragments of the plane were scattered about a large, remote region near the village of Argunovo. Engine explosion? The Guardian cites unconfirmed reports in Russian media that the captain had requested permission for an emergency landing at a nearby airport after reporting a technical malfunction. Witnesses reported seeing the plane in flames as it fell, leading to speculation that an engine had exploded before the crash. End of streak: This is the first crash of a commercial airliner in more than a year, following a sterling aviation record in 2017, notes the BBC. Putin: He offered his condolences to the families of victims and delayed a trip to the Black Sea resort of Sochi, where he planned to meet Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas on Monday.",

A Harvard University junior lost his Facebook internship two hours before he had planned to travel to it after he exploited a privacy issue in the social network's Messenger system. Aran Khanna discussed his experience and findings in a paper published in Harvard's Technology Science journal. \"From 2011 to the start of this study in May 2015, Facebook Messenger collected and shared user geo-locations as the default setting for every message sent from the Android mobile app,\" he writes. The flaw was that those locations could be seen by anyone in a group chat, even if the person who sent the message wasn't friends with everyone else in the group. And so Khanna developed a browser app called Marauder's Map that exposed, on a map, the geo-location data that was being shared. He tweeted about his Chrome extension and posted about it on Medium on May 26. By the 28th, CNN, the Washington Post, and many others had covered his findings; the extension was downloaded 85,000 times. That same day, Facebook asked Khanna to disable the app; he did. The company also deactivated location sharing on desktops and released a June 4 update that required users to opt in to location sharing. It also withdrew Khanna's internship, which was to start on June 1. The official reason given was a violation of the \"high ethical standards expected of interns,\" according to Boston.com. \"This mapping tool scraped Facebook data in a way that violated our terms,\" a Facebook rep tells the site. Khanna says his app was created using his own Messenger history, not data scraping. \"I didn't write the program to be malicious,\" he says.

The US Forest Service tells CBS the fraternity left the campsite in disarray, and it has publicized surveillance pics showing college-age students buying tools that may have been used to cut the trees down. The trees that were felled included Douglas firs, white firs, and cedars, a Lassen rep tells the Sacramento Bee. Per the Times, camper Jon Elam told federal authorities he ran into 80 or so of the frat's members at the campground, including Jossey and three others who identified themselves as part of a Chico State fraternity that would be taking part in an initiation ceremony; Elam says he heard gunfire and trees being felled that night. He told the feds he saw the downed trees the next day and left, returning almost a week later to find a huge mess at the campsite. Elam filed a police report on April 28. In a Facebook post, the fraternity denies the charges and says it has filed its own police report, apparently against Elam. Pi Kappa Alpha's national organization says the Chico chapter has been suspended until the probe is done; a university rep says the frat has been suspended from campus.

Bobby Lee Pearson was acquitted of burglary in a Fresno courtroom on Wednesday after eight jurors mistakenly signed a not-guilty form, the AP reports. The flabbergasted judge ordered Pearson released because the verdict had already been filed on the record. Pearson went home to get some clothes and belongings after being released, but police say he got into a fight with his sister's boyfriend, who stabbed him and killed him. Police say the boyfriend, Willie Gray, is being treated for injuries and will face murder charges once he is booked into the Fresno County Jail.

The UK Intellectual Property Office ruled this week that Scottish craft brewer BrewDog was wrong to apply to register the names \"Elvis Juice\" and \"BrewDog Elvis Juice\" for a beer it released in 2015, Munchies reports. Elvis, who died in 1977, had his name and likeness trademarked by Elvis Presley Enterprises, which earns millions of dollars through a licensing program that allows the sale of Elvis merchandise worldwide. \"Put simply, and notwithstanding that Mr Presley died nearly 40 years ago, he was/is such an iconic figure, that I would be very surprised if many people, including those at the younger end of the average consumer age spectrum, had not heard of him,\" the hearing officer said in a statement. \"I consider most average consumers, on seeing the name Elvis alone, are likely to conceptualise that on the basis of Elvis Presley.\" BrewDog co-founders James Watt and Martin Dickie changed their names to Elvis in response to the trademark application and say Elvis Juice is one of the company's best-selling products.",

Last week, the UK Intellectual Property Office ruled that BrewDog must change the name of its grapefruit-infused Elvis Juice IPA after attorneys for Elvis Presley Enterprises objected to the brewer applying to register \"Elvis Juice\" and \"Brewdog Elvis Juice\" as trademarks, the Daily Record reports. The Scottish brewers launched the IPA in 2015 and it quickly became a bestseller. Not long after, however, attorneys for the Presley estate sent them a copyright infringement notice. In response, BrewDog co-founders James Watt and Martin Dickie legally changed their first names to \"Elvis\" in October 2016. \"There isn't just one single person in the world called Elvis, so we added two more to make a point,\" Watt told Munchies at the time. Despite those efforts, hearing officer Oliver Morris ruled last week against the brewers, saying, \"On the basis that Elvis is a relatively uncommon name, and given that Mr. Presley is the most famous of Elvises, I consider that most average consumers, on seeing the name Elvis alone, are likely to conceptualize that on the basis of Elvis Presley.\" In addition to losing the name of one of its most popular products, BrewDog must also pay the Presley estate $1,934 in court costs.

The WFP isn't commenting on the report, but it did say in a statement to NPR that \"the purpose of WFP in Myanmar is and always has been to address the food and nutrition needs of vulnerable people.\" The report comes as the UN Security Council prepares to hold an emergency meeting on the Rohingya crisis. The AP reports that the Myanmar military has been conducting \"a campaign of rape, murder, and arson\" against the Rohingya since August after Rohingya militants attacked security outposts. The military says it's protecting citizens, but the Rohingya say they've been subjected to \"genocide,\" and the UN has called it an \"unspeakable brutality.\" The new report cites \"restriction of movement\" by security forces as one of the main constraints on accessing food. Residents still did not have full access to the forest, agricultural land, and fishing grounds due to continuous military presence. More than 80,000 children under the age of 5 are \"wasting\"\u2014a potentially fatal condition that could lead to permanent weight loss. The report was removed from the website of the Myanmar government, which asked it to be taken down.",

Myanmar was upset with the report's claim that military forces were blocking access to food for the Rohingya even before a government crackdown led 537,000 to flee to Bangladesh, per NPR. But the Guardian reports the UN's World Food Program might have its own reasons for wanting the report erased. According to one source, UN officials knew the report was \"potentially damaging,\" as it suggested WFP food aid cuts to the Rohingya over a two-year period were causing harm, even starvation. \"There was a real sense that they had things to hide,\" the source says. The WFP tells a very different story: The agency \"stands by its original assessment\" that 80,000 Rohingya children under the age of five were suffering from potentially fatal weight loss in Rakhine in July. However, the food situation will have changed since an \"upsurge in violence\" in August, \"just months before the next harvest,\" a rep tells the Telegraph. \"In a dynamic and evolving situation, it is important to coordinate closely with all partners, including the government,\" WFP adds, noting its decision to scrap the previous report came \"following a request by the government to conduct a joint review.\" That review has stalled with Myanmar keeping agencies out of the conflict zone, however. The WFP says it's continuing to push for access.",

According to the New York Times, Sandusky pleaded guilty to charges that he pressured a teenage girl to send him naked photos and asked her teenage sister to give him oral sex. The charges include solicitation of statutory sexual assault and solicitation of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. As part of the deal, Sandusky will spend up to six years in state prison, but the judge could impose a sentence of as much as eight years.

Jeffrey Sandusky is on his way to a Pennsylvania state prison after pleading guilty to 14 counts of child sexual abuse, reports CNN. Under a plea deal, the 41-year-old will spend between three and eight years in prison. Prosecutors say Sandusky pressured a teenage girl under 16 to send him nude photos, the New York Times reports. After her father reported messages from Sandusky to police last year, investigators discovered that he had asked the girl's sister to perform oral sex on him in 2013, when she was 13. He pleaded guilty to charges including soliciting sex from a child younger than 16. Authorities say Sandusky, a former state prison guard who knew the girls through dating their mother, tried to persuade them that what he was doing was normal, saying \"it's not weird because he studied medicine,\" but asking them not to show his messages to anybody. Sandusky, like his mother, Dottie, loyally supported his father through his trial for the sexual abuse of 10 boys, the Times notes. Sandusky will now be classed as a Tier III sex offender, Pennsylvania's highest level, meaning he will have to register with state police for life and verify his information four times a year.

Zou Yongliao, an engineer with the Chinese Academy of Sciences' moon exploration department, told state broadcaster CCTV on Wednesday that China plans to launch its Chang'e 4 probe to the side sometime before 2020, the AP reports. Zou said the mission's objective would be to study geological conditions on the Dark Side, which could eventually lead to the placement of a radio telescope, something that would help \"fill a void\" in man's knowledge of the universe. Radio transmissions from Earth are unable to reach the dark sides of the moon, making it an excellent location for sensitive instruments. If successful, that would make China only the third country after the United States and Russia to have carried out such a maneuver, Michael Brown at Monash University in Austrailia tells Al Jazeera. \"This shouldn't be too difficult a problem to solve, given spacecraft orbiting Mars regularly relay signals from the Opportunity and Curiosity rovers that are driving around on that planet,\" he says.",

This week, Zou Yongliao of the Chinese Academy of Sciences announced plans to send a probe designated Chang'e 4 to the moon's far side by 2020, according to the Asia Times. \"China will be the first to complete the task if it is successful,\" Zou said. In 2013, China became the third country to land a probe\u2014Chang'e 3\u2014on the moon, following the United States and Soviet Union. China plans to study the geology of the far side of the moon\u2014which is never visible from Earth\u2014in order to put a radio telescope there. The dark side of the moon would be ideal for studying radio waves because the moon itself blocks any interfering waves coming from Earth. However, that also makes landing a probe on the moon's far side more difficult, according to the International Business Times. Without radio signals from Earth, China will require additional satellite technology to communicate with the probe. In the meantime, the AP reports that China will be sending an unmanned spaceship to and from the moon to collect samples in 2017.

In humans, however, the bacteria can cause a blood infection, or sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and even death.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday that the White House had \"reviewed whether there was a legal issue\" and determined there was no basis for criminal charges. \"Just because you're not going to charge him with the Logan Act, there's certainly nothing to preclude you from going forward under 1001,\" former federal prosecutor Peter Zeidenberg tells the Times. The Logan Act prohibits US citizens from engaging in negotiations with foreign governments, and Flynn has admitted \"inadvertently\" giving \"incomplete information\" to Vice President-elect Mike Pence about his talks with Sergei Kislyak. According to the Washington Post, the FBI interviewed Flynn within days of Trump's inauguration and he told the FBI he hadn't discussed sanctions with the ambassador. But the Justice Department warned the Trump administration two weeks ago that Flynn had misled Pence, but the vice president didn't learn of the warning until two weeks later, administration officials say. Rush Limbaugh blamed the media Tuesday for Flynn's \"political assassination.\"",

It was a legal review,\" an administration source tells CNN. In other developments: The FBI interviewed Flynn in late January after it warned the Trump administration that he could be blackmailed, the New York Times reports. If authorities determine that he lied during that interview, he could face felony charges. In an interview with the Daily Caller hours before his resignation, Flynn insisted there were \"no lines crossed\" in his conversation with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. \"It wasn't about sanctions. It was about the 35 guys who were thrown out,\" Flynn said, referring to former President Obama's expulsion of Russian diplomats in December. \"It was basically, 'Look, I know this happened. We'll review everything.' I never said anything such as, 'We're going to review sanctions,' or anything like that.\" Legal experts tell Politico that Flynn faces a real risk of prosecution if he wasn't truthful with the FBI, and claiming to have forgotten parts of the conversation probably won't work. Lawyer Mark Zaid says a puzzling aspect of the case is that, as a former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Flynn must have known that conversations with ambassadors from countries like Russia would be under surveillance. Republican senators are among those calling for a full investigation of the Flynn affair, but he still has his defenders, including Rush Limbaugh.

The other video shows McDonald rushing over as Hollins was lying in the street and slamming his foot into Hollins' head. Hollins' lip and nose appeared to be bloodied in his booking photo. Bongiovanni's incident report said he had pulled Hollins over for a busted brake light and a lack of signaling while changing lanes. The officer said Hollins had started to \"act strange,\" yell, and resist directions, and he remembered similarly disruptive behavior from a previous arrest. Hollins was released on bond Thursday after he was charged with the original citations, in addition to driving with a suspended or revoked license and registration and possessing less than an ounce of pot.

In this case, the earth moved in such a way that it caused the tsunami. \"We won't know what caused it until that's done,\" says Robert Patton, a seismologist at the University of California, Berkeley. He notes that the quake may have caused an undersea landslide that displaced water and created the tsunami waves. The AP reports that Indonesia was supposed to be one of the first countries to get a tsunami-warning system in place, but funding issues stalled the project. A prototype developed with $3 million from the US National Science Foundation has been stalled in the testing phase for years. It is too late for central Sulawesi, where walls of water up to 20 feet high and a magnitude 7.5 earthquake killed at least 832 people in Palu and Donggala, tragically highlighting the weaknesses of the existing warning system and low public awareness about how to respond to warnings. \"To me this is a tragedy for science, even more so a Tragedy for the Indonesian people as the residents of Sulawesi are discovering right now,\" says Louise Comfort, a University of Pittsburgh expert in disaster management.",

Tsunamis like the 18-foot monster wave that wrecked cities on Sulawesi island are usually caused by \"megathrust\" earthquakes that move land vertically, not \"strike-slip\" quakes like the 7.5-magnitude one Friday, which moved the earth horizontally, Patton says. The Sulawesi event was, however, localized, unlike the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.

The technology, which will be rolled out over the next few months, will allow Disney to determine the age and gender of each guest who walks into one of the parks, as well as whether they've eaten at a Disney restaurant, ridden a Disney ride, or visited a Disney attraction.

He had been wrongfully convicted years earlier in a rape case and served 18 years in prison before he and his nephew, Brendan Dassey, were arrested in Halbach's death. In the filing, Avery takes issue with a search conducted during the murder investigation, saying improperly included multiple properties and therefore any evidence that was uncovered \"is clearly 'FRUIT OF THE POISONOUS TREE,'\" the AP reports.

The team, which has been working in the region since 2008, used a technology called LiDAR (light detection and range technology) to uncover more than 60,000 ancient structures covering 1,305 square miles, including the altar.

This shows that people were aware of other groups and exchanging raw materials long before the arrival of modern humans. \"What is genuinely exciting about the discoveries ... is that we now know that one or more hominin groups were doing seemingly 'modern' things at this critical time period\u2014bringing materials over great distances and passing them on a scale.\" (Click to read about the discovery, which shows how Neanderthals, which may show how Neanderthal and how they've learned how they learned.",

Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups\u2014it's not clear which species is responsible\u2014had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools \u2026 designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)",

Toss it. In fact, the alert includes advice on how to clean your refrigerator if romaine has been inside it recently. So far, 32 people in 11 states have gotten sick, and 13 required hospitalization. No deaths have been reported. \"This advice includes all types or uses of romaine lettuce, such as whole heads of romaine, hearts of romaine, and bags and boxes of precut lettuce and salad mixes that contain romaine, including baby romaine, spring mix, and Caesar salad,\" the CDC said. \"If you do not know if the lettuce is romaine or whether a salad mix contains romaine, do not eat it and throw it away.\" (Tainted water was blamed in a different outbreak involving romaine earlier this year.)",

Arron Perry's shot from an elevated position was the longest confirmed kill shot in military history, beating the record set by a British sniper in 2009 when he shot a Taliban gunner with a 338 Lapua Magnum rifle from 2,475 meters away. \"This is an incredible feat. It is a world record that might never be equalled,\" a Canadian military insider tells the Globe and Mail. \"The shot in question actually disrupted a Daesh attack on Iraqi security forces,\" a military source says. \"Instead of dropping a bomb that could potentially kill civilians in the area, it is a very precise application of force and because it was so far way, the bad guys didn't have a clue what was happening.\" Over the last 15 years, the record has been broken four times, three of them by Canadians. \"Canadian snipers are the best in the world,\" former Cpl. Rob Furlong tells Maclean's. The sniper training program has been around for a long time. It's the foundation, and it's been retooled from lessons learned in Afghanistan. We've built it to be the best.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 An amazing, if grisly, feat continues to resonate after a report in Thursday's Globe and Mail of Toronto. The newspaper, quoting military sources, says a Canadian sniper in Iraq killed an ISIS militant from the mind-boggling distance of 3,540 meters, or 2.2 miles. The Canadian military has not confirmed what would be the longest kill shot by a sniper in history, but the story has in the meantime drawn attention to something else: the remarkable prowess of Canadian snipers in general. Some coverage: The training: If confirmed, that means the sniper record has been broken four times in the last 15 years, three of those times by Canadians, notes Maclean's magazine. One reason, it says, is because Canadian snipers \"are not simply taught to hit their targets.\" The training goes beyond their shooting duties, making sure they're able to \"design and run complex operations\" if necessary. \"That in itself may not make them better snipers but the gestalt of sniper-training and command-thinking combined could explain their skill.\" Long history: The CBC examines the history of Canada's military marksmanship, noting that Cpl. Francis Pegahmagabow of the 1st Canadian Infantry Battalion had 378 kills, making him deadliest sniper of World War I. A military historian says the skill carried into WWII. \"The best snipers were usually country boys who knew how to hunt.\" Official statement: The Canadian military has not confirmed the kill, but it did confirm the shot. \"A member of the Joint Task Force 2 successfully hit a target from 3,540 meters,\" it says in an email to NPR, adding that it won't divulge further details for troop safety. Really? The Globe and Mail says the shot was verified by video and data, but that hasn't emerged yet, and some are skeptical. The Washington Post talks to former US snipers who say that even seeing a human target would be difficult from that distance, even with advanced scopes. A theory floated by a former Marine shooter: \"A spotter with an advanced optical device was able to verbally walk the sniper onto the target and correct his aim.\u201d Yes: Canadian Cpl. Rob Furlong, who once held the record himself at 2,430 meters, counters the skeptics: \u201cIt\u2019s not an impossible distance,\u201d he says. \u201cSo to the naysayers I would just say, this can be done.\u201d It's a \"hell of a shot,\" adds former Canadian sniper Jody Mitic, who was written a book called, of course, Unflinching: The Making of a Canadian Sniper. A critic: In a post at Stuff.co.nz, John Edens thinks the shot was possible, given high-tech gizmos to account for everything from wind speed to the curvature of the earth. Plus, the gun used, a McMillan TAC-50 rifle, employs a 50-caliber bullet the size of a \"large cigar.\" His beef, though, is with media coverage that he thinks glorifies war. \"It's an achievement to a point, but it's not really one humanity should be proud of.\"",

Paul Holes, a retired Contra Costa County DA who helped lead the investigation, tells the AP that he used the open-source site GEDmatch to find relatives of suspected Golden State Killer Joseph James DeAngelo. He says the site returned a list of relatives\u2014with names and emails\u2014by degree of shared single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs, which offer a genetic fingerprint. On average, you share 50% of your SNPs with a sibling, 25% with a half sibling, 12.5% with a first cousin, and 3.1% with a second cousin. The hits on DeAngelo came from third and fourth cousins, Holes says. \"I'm not familiar with any other case used to capture someone like this,\" says Holes, who built more than 25 family trees using data from the site. The site's operator says he was unaware GEDmatch was used in the search for the East Area Rapist, the Sacramento Bee reports. \"Although we were not approached by law enforcement or anyone else about this case or about the DNA, it has always been GEDmatch's policy to inform users that the database could be used for other,\" he says. Police sources tell the Los Angeles Times that DeAngelo, 72, was living close to where the murders and rapes took place in the 1970s and '80s.",

They now know that they're related to a suspected serial killer. Police say they tracked the suspected Golden State Killer by comparing DNA from one of his many crime scenes to genetic information freely available online, the Sacramento Bee reports. They traced family trees for possible suspects and singled out DeAngelo, a 72-year-old ex-cop, last Thursday. Sacramento County District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert says DeAngelo was placed under surveillance, and DNA collected from discarded items provided \"astronomical evidence\" that he was the killer. Schubert tells the Bee that when she was informed of the DNA test results, \"I probably used a few words I wouldn't put in a newspaper, but basically said, 'You'd better not be lying to me.'\" She adds: \"There were a lot of holy s--- moments.\" DeAngelo was arrested outside his home Tuesday. The San Jose Mercury News reports that investigators used the open-source genealogy website GEDMatch.com to search for the suspect who committed 12 murders and more than 50 rapes between 1974 and 1986. Other genealogy websites, including Ancestry.com and 23andMe, say they weren't contacted by police about the case and that they never provide customer information to law enforcement unless they're legally compelled to.

The White House's goal is \"preventing Assad from using chemical weapons again,\" a Democratic aide said. As to the British vote against using force, the administration said that \"the president will make a decision based on what is best for the US and not what other countries would do,\" said Rep. Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \"I don't think the UK ought to have a veto on what the US does or doesn't do.\" Officials said Obama still hadn't settled on a course of action\u2014but the Times says \"all indications\" suggest a strike on the heels of the UN's departure from Damascus tomorrow. But we may know more soon: A senior administration official tells CNN the administration will today release declassified intelligence supporting the claim that the Syrian regime launched a chemical attack.",

The Boston Globe says it most likely dates to eighth-century Egypt, and the chemical composition of its ink is in line with the carbon-based inks the people of that country used at the time. But the Globe cautions that a master forger could have accessed the proper materials, and that traditional ink-dating methods couldn't be used because the papyrus is so small: a fragment roughly 1.5-by-3 inches in size bearing just eight incomplete lines (translation here). The Review also published a rebuttal by Brown Egyptology professor Leo Depuydt, who points to \"gross grammatical errors\" he says no native speaker of Coptic would make, the New York Times reports. (More criticism of the papyrus here.) The new findings certainly don't prove that Jesus was married, a point that King has never challenged; she'd like to see the debate shift to discussions of the document's significance, and \"questions like, 'Why does Jesus being married, or not, even matter?'\" King was in 2011 asked to review the fragment at the request of its anonymous owner, who says he bought it more than a decade earlier from a collector who said he purchased it, along with five others, in East Germany in the '60s.",

Researchers trained three groups of bees\u2014two pre-trained, and two not-pre-trained\u2014to pull strings from an artificial flower placed under a table. The bees were then shown clips of them pulling the strings, which they'd earned by foraging for the flower. Researchers found that bees who had already learned to pull the strings were more likely to continue. In one experiment, they spent 10 minutes looking for a blue flower with a string attached and were able to pull it off in five minutes. In another, they had observers watch as they pulled the flower\u2014 Bees don't just figure out where to find food\u2014they're able to figure out how to find it. The study's lead author, a professor of entomology, explains to the New York Times that the blue flower is a \"window into the world of bees,\" allowing the bees to see what's around them and what they need to do to get the reward. To test this, researchers had bees in two\u2014one with more\u2014and watched as other bees in the same colony pulled the string in different ways. When paired with their peers, the trained bees took 2.5 times longer topull the string. \"cultural transmission does not require the high cognitive sophistication specific to humans, nor is a distinctive feature of humans,\" the study author tells the Washington Post.",

Imagine a sesame seed clinging to a burger bun, reports the Washington Post\u2014in other words, it's about 0.0002% the volume of a human brain, as calculated by Science. But that doesn't mean you can't teach a bee a new trick, as behavioral ecologist Clint Perry tells the paper: \"Bees have some amazing cognitive abilities,\" including counting up to at least four. And now he and colleagues from Queen Mary University of London are reporting in the journal Plos Biology that bees can not only learn an entirely new skill to get food but also pass on their knowledge, which is one of the basic aspects of culture. In their study, researchers placed blue discs with sugar water beneath a clear plastic table, just out of reach, but affixed a string to each one that, if tugged, would move it within reach. Out of 110 bumble bees individually introduced to the task, some tugged at the strings before eventually quitting, and only two sorted out how to pull on the string to get the sugar water. However, when bees got to watch the ones retrieving the sugar water, more than 60% of them were able to pull the string when it was their turn. One of the researchers tells Science that, as exciting as the findings are, the explanation isn't necessarily that bees are smart, but that \"culturelike phenomena might actually be based on relatively simple mechanisms.\" (One type of bumblebee has nearly gone extinct in 20 years.)",

Researchers looked at the health histories of more than 5,600 people around the world, the New York Times reports.

Researchers scanned the brains of 1,187 healthy people between the ages of 3 and 20 and found, for instance, that the size of the hippocampus tends to be smaller in those with the e2/e4 combination. They also found some kids with e4 didn't perform as well on tests of memory, though they caught up with their peers by age 10, reports HealthDay News. And while brain researcher Rebecca Knickmeyer, who didn't participate in the study but wrote an accompanying editorial, says the variants aren't necessarily predictive and people shouldn't start testing their kids, the research suggests that Alzheimer's may in fact be a developmental disorder, not strictly an aging one, reports the Los Angeles Times. That raises the possibility that adjustments to \"diet or cognitive training\" early on could change someone's \"trajectory,\" per Knickmeyer. Three in four people have at least one copy of e3, which seems to offer a protective effect. About 14% of people have an e4 variant, which has been linked with an elevated risk of Alzheimer's, but Knickmeyer points out that there are many Alzheimer's patients without e4, and many with e4 who never develop Alzheimer's.

What's more, people are getting dementia later, with the average age at diagnosis increasing from 80.7 to 82.4 over the same period, reports the New York Times. One possible factor: A person's average education increased during that period from 11.8 years to 12.7 years, say University of Michigan researchers. \"Education might actually change the brain itself,\" lead author Kenneth Langa tells NPR. \"We think that it actually creates more, and more complicated, connections between the nerve cells so that you're able to keep thinking normally later into life.\" Another potential factor: While health ailments linked to dementia such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol increased, people were treating them with better medications. The study draws on long-range data about 20,000 Americans from all kinds of backgrounds, and Langa says it suggests that dire predictions about the nation's dementia problem might have been been overstated. The Alzheimer's Association isn't so sure: Though dementia rates may be falling, \"the total number of Americans with Alzheimer's and other dementias is expected to continue to increase dramatically\" as the number of older adults climbs,\" it says.

Researchers conducted aerial surveys in the zone during winter months between 1987\u2014a year after the Chernobyl disaster\u2014and 1997 and estimated animal populations based on tracks in the snow, reports the Guardian. They found the number of animals in the area was actually on par with those in four uncontaminated nature reserves nearby; but the number of wolves was more than seven times greater than in reserves. The numbers of elk, roe deer, and wild boar also jumped at a time when elk and wild boar populations were sliding elsewhere in the former Soviet Union. \"It's very likely that wildlife numbers at Chernobyl are much higher than they were before the accident,\" a researcher says in a release. \"This doesn't mean radiation is good for wildlife, just that the effects of human habitation, including hunting, farming, and forestry, are a lot worse.\" But another researcher who has studied birds in the zone tells the BBC the research \"only applies to large mammals under hunting pressure, rather than the vast majority of animals\u2014most birds, small mammals, and insects\u2014that are not directly influenced by human habitation.\" And since the study didn't look at radiation exposure, it \"does not address the issue of whether radiation has effects on reproduction, survival, longevity, or general health of the animals surveyed.\" While scientists found Chernobyl's wild boar population dipped in 1993, they say hungry wolves and a disease outbreak were to blame.

Ben Beard, who helps run the CDC's Zika outbreak initiative, concurs there may soon be a proliferation of the blood-hungry mosquitoes in Louisiana due to the massive flooding, but not necessarily of the Zika-carrying kind, as that variety is tinier and therefore more likely to be swept away with the floodwaters. Meanwhile, Zika is already affecting the Bayou State in another way: Per KENS, blood donors are desperately being sought there because locals who've recently traveled to Zika-affected regions can't give blood for about a month after they've come back from their trip, a logistical issue that, along with other factors, has caused a blood shortage in the state.

The candidate was last week dinged by Mitt Romney over ventures like Trump University, Trump Airlines, Trump Vodka, Trump Magazine, and Trump Steaks, reports NBC News. (\"A business genius he is not,\" is how Romney put it.) And so Trump did his best to counter that claim, trotting out his steaks (\"if you want to take one we'll charge 50 bucks a steak,\" he said), his magazine (a copy was lobbed into the crowd, notes TPM), his water, and his wine (from the \"largest winery on the East Coast\"). As RealClearPolitics national political reporter, Caitlin Huey-Burns\u2014and many others\u2014put it, \"This is like Trump QVC.\" But not all digs were aimed at Trump. \"I hope the Trump speech lasts another 4 hours and I hope the Cable networks will carry it all, because there is obviously no news judgment,\" former NPR political editor Ken Rudin tweeted, as spotted by Politico. Politico points out that CNN, Fox, and MSNBC carried the entirety of Trump's press conference even though Hillary Clinton and John Kasich spoke during the 9pm ET hour. And as far as mocking goes, Trump didn't just take it, he dished it. At one point, NBC News reporter Peter Alexander asked the candidate about how parents should explain his language to their kids. Trump's reply, per Gawker: \"Oh, you\u2019re so politically correct. You\u2019re so beautiful. Oh, look at you. Awwww. Aw, he\u2019s so. Oh, I know. You\u2019ve never heard a little bad, a little off, language. I know, you\u2019re so perfect. Aren\u2019t you perfect. Aren\u2019t you just a perfect young man. Give me a break. You know what? It\u2019s stuff like that that people in this country are tired of. It\u2019s stuff like that.\" So how are those no-longer-available Trump Steaks? Archived, and not too kind, reviews here.",

I see them in hospitals, in psychiatric wards, and it is absolutely heart-breaking.\" Researchers at King's College London looked at 800 people aged 18 to 65 in London, including 410 who reported a first episode of psychosis at a London psychiatric hospital and 370 healthy participants within the same age range. They found skunk users were three times more likely to develop psychosis than non-users, while heavy users were fivefold more likely. \"Compared with those who had never tried cannabis, users of high potency skunk-like cannabis had a threefold increase in risk of psychosis,\" says lead author Marta Di Forti. \"The results show that psychosis risk in cannabis users depends on both the frequency of use and cannabis potency.\" The study found psychosis was more common among people who used hashish, not skunk, the main psychoactive ingredient. Unlike skunk, hashish contains another chemical called cannabidiol, or CBD, and research suggests this can act as an antidote to the THC, counteracting psychotic side effects. \"As someone affected by this issue it is hard watching mainstream media, particularly comedy films, portraying cannabis as a harmless life-enhancing substance with limited ill-effects,\" one user tells the BBC. \"It's simply not true.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Despite efforts to reclassify marijuana down to a Schedule II (read: less dangerous) drug, there are some people who still insist on its dangers\u2014and new research may back those theories up. Scientists at King's College London have discovered that smoking potent, or \"skunklike,\" cannabis was tied to almost a quarter of all new psychosis cases they studied, the BBC reports. The study published in the Lancet compared 410 patients between the ages of 18 and 65 who had experienced \"first-episode psychosis\" with 370 healthy patients. The results suggest that the development of psychosis\u2014i.e., delusions and hallucinations\u2014is three times greater for skunk smokers than for nonusers, and up to five times higher if they smoked it every day. Hashish, a milder form of cannabis that contains much less THC than the skunk variety, isn't linked to any increased risk for psychosis. English experts say that skunk cannabis is widespread, with one doctor telling the BBC, \"In London, it's very difficult to find anything else.\" Anecdotal stories that back up the study's warnings are worrisome. One woman tells the BBC that, after smoking skunk pot, she \"went from someone who had never experienced any mental health issues whatsoever to an absolute wreck.\" A recovering addict who's now a drug counselor tells Sky News that skunk is the \"Incredible Hulk of cannabis [and is] absolutely decimating young people's lives.\" Still, despite the warnings, study researchers point out that, according to a 2010 study in the Lancet, the three most harmful drugs are alcohol, crack cocaine, and heroin; cannabis falls at No. 8, notes Channel 4 News. (It's not the first time suspicions have been raised linking skunk cannabis to psychosis.)",

Makaziwe and Zenani Mandela say lawyers George Bizos and Bally Chuene \"failed to carry out their duties as directors with due care, skill, and diligence\" and should be removed, reports the Star of South Africa. The companies, Harmonieux Investment Holdings and Magnifique Investment Holdings, channel funds from the sale of the 94-year-old anti-apartheid leader's prints for the benefit of the Mandela family. The proceeds are estimated at more than $15 million. Bizos says Mandela appointed him and the other directors to the companies five years ago \"in order to further their interests and get their hands on the money.\" \"There is no basis to the allegations,\" he says. \"We are not hijackers.

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 How long would it take to reach the other side of the planet if you jumped in and let gravity pull you through? For decades, physics students have been asked to calculate that time and have been taught that the correct answer is 42 minutes. Now, a more realistic analysis has lopped 4 minutes off that estimate. \"This is the kind of paper we love,\" says David Jackson, editor of the American Journal of Physics. The new calculation, which appears in the March issue of the journal, doesn't merely add more detail about the structure of Earth. It also explains why you can replace one overly simple assumption with another equally crude one and still get a much more accurate answer. The gravity tunnel problem is a staple of introductory physics courses because it simultaneously demonstrates both striking features of Isaac Newton's law of gravity and a common but very important type of cyclical motion. To solve it, students must calculate how the force of gravity on an object changes as the thing falls through the tunnel. Students assume that, like a billiard ball, Earth has the same density throughout: roughly 5500 kilograms per cubic meter. In that case, the strength of the gravitational force pulling you toward Earth's center varies in proportion to the distance from the center. Alexander Klotz, a student at McGill University in Canada, used seismic data to calculate the densities at different depths and found it would only take 38 minutes (and 11 seconds) to fall all the way through. \"It is accepted that the speed attained during the descent on the first half of the journey would be significant enough to cause the person to continue moving against gravity against the surface of the Earth at a constant surface.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It's a common hypothetical in physics classrooms: How long would it take to fall through a tunnel from one side of the Earth to the other? The new answer: 38 minutes and 11 seconds, reports Science. The result is courtesy of McGill University graduate student Alexander Klotz, whose calculations take four minutes off the previously accepted answer and appear in the American Journal of Physics. The reason for the shorter time? Unlike previous calculations, Klotz's take into account that the Earth's layers have different densities, and those differences would affect the hypothetical falling man, notes Phys.org. \"The way the Earth is structured, the gravity increases slightly as you go deeper towards the dense core, to about 110% of its surface value, before getting weaker as you move through the core, reaching zero at the center,\u201d says Klotz, as quoted in Forbes. (If it's all a little too hypothetical, try physics-inspired pasta instead.)",
