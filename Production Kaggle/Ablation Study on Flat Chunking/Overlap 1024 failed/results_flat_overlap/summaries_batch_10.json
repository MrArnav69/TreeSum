In today's edition, a former manager and mentor says Cruise used to strut around the house they shared wearing nothing but a G-string, proud as he was of his muscular body. \"I had a mirrored wall and he would stand in front of it, flexing his biceps and admiring himself,\" she tells the Mail. Another weird revelation: Cruise was a devout Catholic before he became a Scientologist, and as a teen he had a vague interest in becoming a priest, Father Ric Schneider tells the Daily Beast. As for Katie Holmes, she's not letting this divorce get in the way of her career\u2014and her upcoming project seems quite telling. She'll start production on Molly next week, a film she co-wrote and is co-producing about a single mother and her daughter, People reports. As for Holmes' actual daughter, it seems Suri could be a sticking point when it comes to the settlement talks Tom and Katie are starting. Cruise won't make a deal unless it includes \"meaningful, significant contact with his daughter,\" sources tell TMZ.

That it?\" The elder Marshall responded with details of his son's fate Tuesday afternoon, tweeting, \"Just so you know @SpeakerRyan: He's grounded.\" But Ryan's take on the dab debacle showed it was less the punishment he was concerned about and more answers that he sought. \"Just finished swearing-in photos. Nearly 300 members. Countless cute kids. Still don't get what dabbing is, though,\" he tweeted Tuesday evening. Someone tape a Panthers game for him?",

North Charleston's city council voted unanimously on Thursday to settle with Walter Scott's family for $6.5 million, the New York Times reports. A city attorney tells the Post and Courier that they're proud they could \"settle a case of this magnitude without a brick being thrown, without a fire being set, and without a lawsuit being filed.\" He says the city took the $6.4 million settlement in the Freddie Gray case and the $5.9 million settlement in the Eric Garner case into account during negotiations. As part of the settlement, Scott's family has agreed not to sue the city or its employees, the Times notes. The city lawyer says that while the payment is large, there was the potential for \"a very large verdict\" if the case went to court because there's video of the shooting and former officer Michael Slager has been charged with murder. \"It's historic,\" an attorney for the Scott family tells the Washington Post. \"It sets a good precedent for a city not tolerating this sort of behavior from police officers.\" Anthony Scott, Walter Scott's brother, says the settlement ensures that Scott's four children will be taken care of financially, and a portion of it will be donated to the Red Cross to help flood victims in the state, the Post and Courier reports. (Slager is in jail awaiting trial for the April 4 shooting, and he says video of the incident doesn't tell the whole story.)",

Sharief said three people died at the Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills and two more were declared dead at a hospital, the South Florida Sun Sentinel reports. A sixth death was announced in a press release later Wednesday morning. It may have all been due to extreme temperatures at the facility, though the causes of death haven't yet been officially determined. A police rep simply said \"a number of people\" were \"in respiratory distress\" at the facility; 115 people were evacuated from it. More on the deaths and other Irma-related news: Hollywood Police Chief Tom Sanchez says precautionary checks are being performed at the other nursing homes in the area, the Miami Herald reports. Sanchez says a criminal investigation into the deaths has been opened. The Airstron employee who had been trying to fix the AC unit tells Local 10 that a fuse needed to cool the unit popped out during the hurricane. He says he's been trying to repair the facility's unit for days, but Florida Power & Light (FPL) has yet to fix the fuse for him despite his phone calls. The Washington Post reports a rep for FPL noted the county didn't designate the facility as \"top critical\"\u2014meaning a place given priority attention\u2014during a 2017 hurricane planning meeting. The Post separately reported that as of Wednesday morning some 40% of the state was still without power, and that some may not see it for as long as weeks. The mayor of Naples, Fla., put it bluntly: \"The biggest issue is power. It\u2019s 92 degrees and the sun is out and it\u2019s smoking out there.\u201d FPL's best estimate at this point for when power will be restored to those along the state's west coast: Sept. 22. Carbon monoxide is also an issue in the wake of the storm: The Los Angeles Times reports that at least five people have died and more than a dozen others have been treated after breathing carbon monoxide fumes from generators.",

Good job Jeff......\" The president's striking suggestion that the Justice Department consider politics when making decisions showed his disregard for the agency's independence. Investigators are never supposed to take into account the political affiliations of the people they investigate. Trump, who did not address the specifics of the charges, did not name the Republicans. But he was apparently referring to the first two Republicans to endorse him in the GOP presidential primaries. Both were indicted on separate charges last month: Rep. Duncan Hunter of California on charges that included spending campaign funds for personal expenses and Rep. Chris Collins of New York on insider trading. Both have proclaimed their innocence. A spokeswoman for Sessions declined comment, and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump did not have any public events Monday. He briefly exited the White House to a waiting motorcade, but then went back inside without going anywhere.",

Spotted by the Claycord News & Talk blog, the van had 12 cameras mounted along with a lidar sensor, which uses a spinning laser to survey the environment. \"When asked about what they are doing, the person sitting in the vehicle would never give an answer,\" says the blog. What's more, CBS San Francisco reports that the vehicle is leased to Apple. Could they be mounting a rival to Google Maps' popular Street View? After all, Apple is planning to release iOS 9 for iPhones and iPads in the summer, and was rather embarrassed by Apple Maps' poor directions and subpar 3D imagery when it first came out. Yet Apple would need a fleet of vehicles to challenge Google's Street View, the Verge notes. Also, technology analyst Rob Enderle says the van has \"too many cameras\" for street-viewing and may in fact be a self-driving vehicle. The van also resembles one seen in a Brooklyn YouTube video that describes it as a \"self-driving car.\" Apple isn't among companies with a permit to test self-driving cars, but the van may be used by an Apple partner who does: \"You know, they have partnerships with a variety of the carmakers,\" says Enderle. \"Just because they\u2019re leasing the car doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s their project.\" Apple has no comment on the high-tech van or vans\u2014so \"it looks like these curious vehicles will remain a mystery for now,\" says the Verge.

As the oldest major-league stadium, Fenway Park has seen the Boston Red Sox through a turbulent century, hosting heroes from Babe Ruth to Ted Williams to Hank Aaron, the Boston Globe notes. Today, you can feel the stadium's age, columnist Dan Shaughnessy tells USA Today: \"The seats between the aisles were built for people 5-foot-6 in 1912,\" and \"some of the things that don't work are never going to work.\" \"But overall, it is the jewel of baseball and the best place to watch a baseball game,\" he concludes. The stadium was the product of a $120,000 purchase of 8 acres of land in Boston. Nearly a century later, the park seemed old-fashioned and small compared to others, and it faced a shutdown. But new owners invested $285 million to bring it up to date, and it's expected to stay in business another 40 years. \"We think of Fenway as the 'Little Engine that Could,' and it just keeps chugging along,\" Red Sox co-owner Tom Werner says.

The Obama17 campaign bears a familiar slogan to go with its familiar face, \"Oui on peut,\" which translates to \"Yes we can,\" according to NPR. The Verge reports the petition to make Obama the French president had 30,000 signatures by Friday morning despite one major stumbling block toward that goal: He's not a French citizen. Obama17 was started by two friends \"after a drink,\" and while they admit it's a joke, they say it's one with a serious point: They're tired of the same French politicians running for office over and over and getting embroiled in scandals. One Obama17 organizer says he's sick of feeling like he's voting \"against\" someone instead of \"for\" someone, and Obama is the only politician who's ever inspired him. He might not be alone. Last year, a poll found 84% of French people trusted Obama to do the right thing on world issues, the Washington Post reports. \"Who cares that he's not French?

Women who sign up for the service will get help with their bags, be guaranteed a window or aisle seat, and be escorted to a pickup point by airline staff, reports Emirates Woman. While this is thought to be the first airline anywhere to offer this kind of service, Air India began providing female-only rows earlier this year in response to assaults in the air. In 2015, researchers in the UK noted that in places with gender equality, separating women \"reinforces a message that women must be contained and segregated in order to protect them,\" but many who are hailing Vistara's new service says safety comes first.

But that doesn't mean you can't teach a bee a new trick, as behavioral ecologist Clint Perry tells the paper: \"Bees have some amazing cognitive abilities,\" including counting up to at least four. And now he and colleagues from Queen Mary University of London are reporting in the journal Plos Biology that bees can not only learn an entirely new skill to get food but also pass on their knowledge, which is one of the basic aspects of culture. In their study, researchers placed blue discs with sugar water beneath a clear plastic table, just out of reach, but affixed a string to each one that, if tugged, would move it within reach. Out of 110 bumble bees individually introduced to the task, some tugged at the strings before eventually quitting, and only two sorted out how to pull on the string to get the sugar water. However, when bees got to watch the ones retrieving the sugar water, more than 60% of them were able to pull the string when it was their turn. One of the researchers tells Science that, as exciting as the findings are, the explanation isn't necessarily that bees are smart, but that \"culturelike phenomena might actually be based on relatively simple mechanisms.\" (One type of bumblebee has nearly gone extinct in 20 years.)",

Reporting in the journal Neuron, University of Hawaii researchers found that the brain development of children as young as preschool age with two copies of e4 or one of e4 and one of e2 seem most adversely affected\u2014an intriguing find in light of previous research that has linked the e4 variant to Alzheimer's. Researchers scanned the brains of 1,187 healthy people between the ages of 3 and 20 and found, for instance, that the size of the hippocampus tends to be smaller in those with the e2/e4 combination. They also found some kids with e4 didn't perform as well on tests of memory, though they caught up with their peers by age 10, reports HealthDay News. And while brain researcher Rebecca Knickmeyer, who didn't participate in the study but wrote an accompanying editorial, says the variants aren't necessarily predictive and people shouldn't start testing their kids, the research suggests that Alzheimer's may in fact be a developmental disorder, not strictly an aging one, reports the Los Angeles Times. That raises the possibility that adjustments to \"diet or cognitive training\" early on could change someone's \"trajectory,\" per Knickmeyer. Three in four people have at least one copy of e3, which seems to offer a protective effect. About 14% of people have an e4 variant, which has been linked with an elevated risk of Alzheimer's, but Knickmeyer points out that there are many Alzheimer's patients without e4, and many with e4 who never develop Alzheimer's.

I would like to take this opportunity one last time to advocate for a chance [to] be given to peace.\" Two big reasons he dropped out: He was somewhere between 0% and 1% in the polls, and he'd raised only $30,000, reports the New York Times. Unlike Jim Webb, Chafee isn't interested in an independent bid, and his departure leaves Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Martin O'Malley in the Democratic contest. (Clinton seems only to have strengthened her campaign after Thursday's marathon grilling over Benghazi.)",

Attorneys for Quinton Tellis, the man on trial for her December 2014 death, argued that made for reasonable doubt, reports BuzzFeed. At least some members of the jury apparently had it: A judge on Monday declared a mistrial in the case. Tellis' first trial, in 2017, ended in a mistrial as well. Tellis was arrested in early 2016 after the local DA said a break in the perplexing case came via \"technological data\" like cellphone records; a DOJ analyst told the court Saturday that Tellis' phone data indicates he was with Chambers the night she died and that he wiped Chambers' texts and info from his phone after her death. BuzzFeed notes that Chambers' father had previously said Tellis' name wasn't known to the family, and the prosecution in this trial described a relationship between Chambers and Tellis that was only a week old. The Clarion Ledger reports the prosecution sought to chip away at the \"Eric\" detail: The medical director at the Firefighters Burn Center estimated she had been on fire for as long as five minutes, and he and a speech pathologist both testified that they don't believe the 19-year-old was capable of intelligible speech based on the severity of her burns. Tellis' attorney, Alton Peterson, thought doubt remained: \"When you have eight trained first responders who were there on the scene ... it's hard to get around her telling them with her dying breaths that someone else did it.\" FOX13 reports prosecutors plan to \"assess things\" and then announce if they'll try Tellis a third time.",

In fact, writes Tom Goldstein at SCOTUSblog, expect a 5-4 decision in favor of striking down Section 5 of the act, one of its core provisions. It requires nine mostly Southern states to get federal permission when they want to change voting rules, and Antonin Scalia and others suggested the measure is no longer necessary, reports the New York Times. Scalia called it a \"perpetuation of racial entitlement,\" Anthony Kennedy wanted to know how long Alabama had to live \"under the trusteeship of the United States government,\" and Chief Justice John Roberts wondered whether people in the South were more racist than those in the North. The court's liberal wing made the case that the act is still necessary, with Stephen Breyer saying the \"old disease\" of racism, along with the desire to keep minorities from voting, remains. If the court strikes down the act, it would likely require Congress to come up with a new formula for it, but both the Times and SCOTUSblog think it's unlikely that would be politically possible.",

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Good news for older Americans: A new study suggests that their odds of getting dementia are shrinking despite predictions to the contrary. While standardized tests showed 11.6% of Americans 65 and older had dementia in 2000, only 8.8% did in 2012, reports NBC News. What's more, people are getting dementia later, with the average age at diagnosis increasing from 80.7 to 82.4 over the same period, reports the New York Times. One possible factor: A person's average education increased during that period from 11.8 years to 12.7 years, say University of Michigan researchers. \"Education might actually change the brain itself,\" lead author Kenneth Langa tells NPR. \"We think that it actually creates more, and more complicated, connections between the nerve cells so that you're able to keep thinking normally later into life.\" Another potential factor: While health ailments linked to dementia such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol increased, people were treating them with better medications. The study draws on long-range data about 20,000 Americans from all kinds of backgrounds, and Langa says it suggests that dire predictions about the nation's dementia problem might have been been overstated. The Alzheimer's Association isn't so sure: Though dementia rates may be falling, \"the total number of Americans with Alzheimer's and other dementias is expected to continue to increase dramatically\" as the number of older adults climbs,\" it says. In the US, the number of people 65 and older is projected to double by 2050, notes NPR. (A game could reduce your dementia risk.)",

Trudeau received a standing ovation for his speech introducing the play. He thanked the cast for working \"to pull together such an extraordinary crowd to celebrate this story of friendship during extraordinarily difficult times between individuals between countries\" and spoke about the close relationship betweeen the US and Canada. \"The world gets to see what it is to lean on each other and be there for each other,\" he said.

Jamie Gorelick, an attorney and ethics adviser for Ivanka Trump, said Monday that the first daughter will not have an official title or receive a salary, but will get a West Wing office, government-issued communications devices, and security clearance to access classified information, the AP reports. Gorelick says Ivanka Trump will follow the ethics rules that apply to government employees. Since President Trump took office, his eldest daughter has been a visible presence in the White House, where her husband, Jared Kushner, serves as a senior adviser. Her role has already come under scrutiny because there is little precedent for a member of the first family with this kind of influence. \"Having an adult child of the president who is actively engaged in the work of the administration is new ground,\u201d Gorelick tells Politico. \"Our view is that the conservative approach is for Ivanka to voluntarily comply with the rules that would apply if she were a government employee, even though she is not.\" (Ivanka Trump's clothing brand has had a surge in sales so far this year.)",

Bob, who was operating Disney's Miramax with Harvey at the time, confirms the payment but says he only agreed because Harvey said \"he was fooling around with two women\" who wanted money \"and he didn't want his wife to find out.\" The payment was also hidden from Disney, but Bob says \"there was nothing to indicate any kind of sexual harassment.\" While Bob Weinstein remains as head of the Weinstein Company, a $275 million bid for its assets led by Maria Contreras-Sweet, former head of the US Small Business Administration, would see 51% of the company controlled by women, reports Deadline. Such a change might be necessary, according to the Weinstein Company's remaining board members, financier Tarak Ben Ammar and director Lance Maerov.

Two high-profile names from the food world are on board, notes Food Safety News: Michael Pollan and Eric Schlosser. \"S 510 is the most important food safety legislation in a generation,\" they said in a joint statement. \"The Tester amendment will make it even more effective, strengthening food safety rules while protecting small farmers and producers.

A new study on animals in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone shows what once looked something like a wasteland is now packed with elk, roe deer, red deer, wild boar, and wolves. Researchers conducted aerial surveys in the zone during winter months between 1987\u2014a year after the Chernobyl disaster\u2014and 1997 and estimated animal populations based on tracks in the snow, reports the Guardian. They found the number of animals in the area was actually on par with those in four uncontaminated nature reserves nearby; but the number of wolves was more than seven times greater than in reserves. The numbers of elk, roe deer, and wild boar also jumped at a time when elk and wild boar populations were sliding elsewhere in the former Soviet Union. \"It's very likely that wildlife numbers at Chernobyl are much higher than they were before the accident,\" a researcher says in a release. \"This doesn't mean radiation is good for wildlife, just that the effects of human habitation, including hunting, farming, and forestry, are a lot worse.\" But another researcher who has studied birds in the zone tells the BBC the research \"only applies to large mammals under hunting pressure, rather than the vast majority of animals\u2014most birds, small mammals, and insects\u2014that are not directly influenced by human habitation.\" And since the study didn't look at radiation exposure, it \"does not address the issue of whether radiation has effects on reproduction, survival, longevity, or general health of the animals surveyed.\" While scientists found Chernobyl's wild boar population dipped in 1993, they say hungry wolves and a disease outbreak were to blame.

Villagers first spotted the naked child looking \"very comfortable in the company of monkeys\" in January in the Katarniya Ghat forest range, a police officer tells the AP. They tried to approach but the monkeys chased them away, reports the Deccan Chronicle. Police were later able to seize the girl, though monkeys also chased an officer as he \"sped away with her in his police car,\" the officer says. The \"highly aggressive\" girl was then taken to a hospital in Bahraich, Uttar Pradesh, where doctors say she initially walked on all fours, ate off the floor with her mouth, and ran from humans, per the Telegraph. She's described as being wound-covered, with long hair and nails. She is now walking upright, eating with her hands, and responding to humans, authorities say. She doesn't appear to speak any language (the Telegraph says she makes only \"unintelligible muttering[s]\"), but is warming up to her doctors and nurses\u2014a possible sign that she retains memories of living with humans, a doctor says.

On June 4, 1629, the Dutch East India ship the Batavia was downed by a reef on its maiden voyage. Most of the roughly 340 people aboard managed to reach nearby Beacon Island, off Western Australia, with the ship's captain setting off in search of help in a longboat. What happened in July of that year was gruesome: The West Australian reports that more than 120 people, among them women and children, were massacred by a group of mutineers led by undermerchant Jeronimus Cornelisz: Some were felled by musket fire or swords, others poisoned or drowned. Upon the captain's return, Cornelisz and many of his men were executed, reports the BBC. The Batavia's wreck was found in 1963, and a mass grave on the island was uncovered in 1999. Australia's ABC reports that the final day of searching the island during a 2013 expedition surfaced a tooth. Upon returning, archaeologists searched the area where the tooth was uncovered and have now found the island's 11th skeleton\u2014with an archaeologist explaining it's the first to have been found using archaeology, while the others found to date were uncovered \"by accident.\" Two musket balls were recovered near the remains, which are believed to be that of a youth. Jeremy Green, the WA Museum's head of maritime archaeology, says it doesn't appear the remains and the tooth are linked, however, indicating there may be another grave nearby. He frames the importance of uncovering more: \"This was the first time that Europeans lived in Australia\u2014albeit it wasn't in the mainland but it was here\u2014so it's the oldest known European habitation in Australia.\" (The tragic story behind three partial skeletons was recently revealed, more than 160 years later.)",

Peter Hotez of the Baylor College of Medicine says that mosquito eggs lying around in vessels such as tires and buckets may start hatching en masse once the floodwaters pull back, and if enough of those eggs come from Zika-carrying Aedes aegypti insects, it's going to be \"crunch time.\" Hotez also warns the risk could similarly rise for other diseases linked to mosquitoes, including West Nile. Louisiana so far hasn't had a documented case of Zika contracted locally, though there have been around two dozen cases of travel-related Zika reported there, per the Shreveport Times. But another expert isn't so sure about the Zika risk. Ben Beard, who helps run the CDC's Zika outbreak initiative, concurs there may soon be a proliferation of the blood-hungry mosquitoes in Louisiana due to the massive flooding, but not necessarily of the Zika-carrying kind, as that variety is tinier and therefore more likely to be swept away with the floodwaters. Meanwhile, Zika is already affecting the Bayou State in another way: Per KENS, blood donors are desperately being sought there because locals who've recently traveled to Zika-affected regions can't give blood for about a month after they've come back from their trip, a logistical issue that, along with other factors, has caused a blood shortage in the state.

The results suggest that the development of psychosis\u2014i.e., delusions and hallucinations\u2014is three times greater for skunk smokers than for nonusers, and up to five times higher if they smoked it every day. Hashish, a milder form of cannabis that contains much less THC than the skunk variety, isn't linked to any increased risk for psychosis. English experts say that skunk cannabis is widespread, with one doctor telling the BBC, \"In London, it's very difficult to find anything else.\" Anecdotal stories that back up the study's warnings are worrisome. One woman tells the BBC that, after smoking skunk pot, she \"went from someone who had never experienced any mental health issues whatsoever to an absolute wreck.\" A recovering addict who's now a drug counselor tells Sky News that skunk is the \"Incredible Hulk of cannabis [and is] absolutely decimating young people's lives.\" Still, despite the warnings, study researchers point out that, according to a 2010 study in the Lancet, the three most harmful drugs are alcohol, crack cocaine, and heroin; cannabis falls at No. 8, notes Channel 4 News. (It's not the first time suspicions have been raised linking skunk cannabis to psychosis.)",

Daughters Makaziwe and Zenani Mandela have sued to oust the directors of two companies that pull in boatloads of money from the sale of Mandela's handprints, reports the Star of South Africa. (Headline: \"War over Madiba millions.\") The daughters say the three men controlling the companies\u2014including Mandela attorney George Bizos\u2014were never properly appointed but have refused to step down. Bizos, though, who defended Mandela in court during the apartheid era, says that Mandela himself appointed them five years ago, reports AP. The daughters are just trying to \"get their hands on the money,\" he said, which is a little confusing because the companies were set up to funnel money to Mandela's family in the first place.",

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It's a common hypothetical in physics classrooms: How long would it take to fall through a tunnel from one side of the Earth to the other? The new answer: 38 minutes and 11 seconds, reports Science. The result is courtesy of McGill University graduate student Alexander Klotz, whose calculations take four minutes off the previously accepted answer and appear in the American Journal of Physics. The reason for the shorter time? Unlike previous calculations, Klotz's take into account that the Earth's layers have different densities, and those differences would affect the hypothetical falling man, notes Phys.org. \"The way the Earth is structured, the gravity increases slightly as you go deeper towards the dense core, to about 110% of its surface value, before getting weaker as you move through the core, reaching zero at the center,\u201d says Klotz, as quoted in Forbes. (If it's all a little too hypothetical, try physics-inspired pasta instead.)",
