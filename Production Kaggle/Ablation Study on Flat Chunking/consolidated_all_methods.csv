Jones, an attorney and former prosecutor, is attempting to become the first Democrat in Alabama's Senate seat since 1992 to win an election for it. He was buoyed by an influx of national Democratic cash and endorsements. Jones' victory is set to narrow the slim Republican majority over Democrats in the Senate to 51-49. His win in the Republican stronghold energizes the Democratic Party as it looks to build on anti-Trump sentiment to mount a challenge next year to Republican control of Congress. Moore shook hands with supporters after they chanted, ""Judge Roy Moore."" He then left to watch returns in another room.

And while it may not feel like it, it's cheaper, too, at least compared to the early '70s, when price fixing meant a flight from New York to LA was not allowed to cost less than about $1,600 in today's dollars.

Here are 5 standouts: Know I'm not being rude when I don't give you a free upgrade: One customer service agent explains ""the airline computer system tracks everything, and big brother can be watching us""—and doling out a free upgrade improperly can be a fireable offense. Don't take off your shoes: It might be tempting to wiggle those toes under the seat, but this isn't your house, and that ""water"" you're stepping on in the bathroom isn't actually water. Don't let those hands wander: If you're tempted to tug at your flight attendant's clothes to get his or her attention as they walk by, just don't. Ever. Keep the number 50 in mind: That's how many passengers are generally served by a single flight attendant. We're not forgetting about you, explains one. We're just dealing with minimal staffing.

Roger Freeman of Federal Way a second term with about 53% of the vote, NBC News notes. There's just one problem: The 48-year-old Freeman died last week after a long battle with colon cancer, the Seattle Times reports. Many voters either didn't know Freeman had died or had already sent in their ballots, the Washington Post reports. ""I did not know that. When did he pass away?"" one voter told KVAL.

If Dovey wins, he will take the seat in Olympia at the start of the next legislative session. ""I think that's something that he would personally want,"" says his legislative director. Freeman was battling colon cancer that spread to his liver and lungs. When he died at the end of October, 15% of voters in his district had already mailed in their ballots, and he had a six-point lead over his Republican opponent. So why did they vote for him? ""I did not know that,"" one voter tells KVAL-TV. ""When did he pass away?"" It's not the first time a dead person has been elected to public office.

2817,"– For 14 years, California-based Spinal Solutions produced the world's best-known brand of spinal implants, one that's used by more than half a million people in the US. But an investigation by the Center for Investigative Reporting finds that the company's products may have been counterfeit, and that the FDA knew about it—and didn't do anything about it. The FBI says it's looking into the allegations, though the agency won't say whether it contacted it. What's more, some of the screws Spinal Solutions is alleged to have produced were actually made by a machinist. More than two dozen plaintiffs have signed on to a massive lawsuit concerning an alleged scheme in which patients received non- FDA approved screws during spine and back surgery. ""The fraudulent non-FDA conforming devices were installed in people's bodies at a very low cost to the providers,"" attorney Brian Kabateck said Friday. ""They were then fraudulently billing the insurance companies, the worker's comp carriers, and making thousands and thousands of dollars off of each patient."" Officials said 28 new cases were filed at the Los Angeles County Superior Court on Friday, making a total of 32 pending cases.","– An 85-year-old machine shop owner in California's Inland Empire was assembling screws for a medical company when he noticed something odd: The threads were missing, and the metal shavings and burrs were all over the place.

Crowder says he told his boss at Spinal Solutions, which makes implants for the spine, but the boss didn't believe him. Instead, he says, the company's operations manager gave him screws that looked like those from South Korea's U&I Corp. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2013 after running out of cash and running into debt with big debts to hardware manufacturers. Williams pleaded guilty last year to federal fraud charges for his role in a scheme to bribe doctors to use the company’s implants. The bribes included cash, vacations, and free wine. One doctor said he was given $20,000 in cash in an envelope packed with $100 bills, while another said Williams gave him a bottle of wine in a $100-bill canister. Spinal Solutions' implants are made by a legitimate company, but CIR alleges that Williams—an entrepreneur who built the company into an $18 million-a-year business selling knee and hip implants—was found guilty of fraud and conspiracy. He was also convicted of domestic violence for hitting his wife. Williams and his wife, Mary, paid the IRS more than $5 million in back taxes between 2009 and 2010, reports the Press-Enterprise.",,,
4945,"– If you've ever wondered what it's like to poop in space, NASA has just the thing for you: The space agency is offering $30,000 to the winner of its ""Space Poop"" competition to come up with a hands-free solution, the Telegraph reports. ""The old standby solution consisted of diapers,"" NASA says. ""However, the diaper is only a very temporary solution, and doesn't provide a healthy/protective option longer than one day."" Astronauts are currently using a vacuum and tube to remove fecal matter and menstrual blood from the International Space Station, but NASA says it could take up to six days to clean up all that waste, NBC News reports. NASA wants to know what can be done to keep its astronauts healthy while they're in space. ""In space, there is no gravity to direct your urine away from your body when you release it,"" says the NASA video for its ""Zero Gravity Solution."" The solution must be able to ""operate effectively for both men and women of varying size and weight within the range of 1% to 99%.""","– If you've ever wondered what it would be like to relieve yourself in space, NASA has just the thing for you: the Space Poop Challenge. The agency is offering $30,000 to the winner of its ""Space Poop"" competition to come up with a hands-free solution for dealing with human waste, Popular Mechanics reports. ""No matter how you look at it, getting rid of wastes has been complicated, crude, uncomfortable, and messy, even with the use of hands,"" NASA says. ""And now we are saying that you—NASA is looking for a way to make life on the International Space Station a little easier for its astronauts."" Right now, astronauts have to wear an adult diaper while in space because there's no gravity to direct urine away from their bodies. But in microgravity, solids and liquids don't act the way they do on Earth, and sometimes solids, liquids, and gases do cling to each other due to surface tension. So what to do? NASA wants a device that can be worn inside a space suit for up to six days without using hands. The solution must be able to manage the waste of up to 75 grams of fecal matter. ""The crew member will have less than 60 minutes to get into and seal their spacesuit,"" the agency says on the HeroX website. ""To ensure the crew member's safety, the solution needs to take no more than five minutes.""","NASA is asking everyday terrestrials to come up with cosmic solutions to a very down-to-earth problem: how to deal with human waste when you’re trapped in a space suit for up to a week. 
 
 The American space agency has launched a competition for participants to invent a hands-free system that routes and collects waste away from the astronaut’s body for up to six days. Inventors have the chance of winning $30,000, and have until Dec. 20 to submit their best “space poop” ideas. 
 
 “I can tell yo...","– Pooping in space ""isn't glamorous, but it is necessary for survival,"" an astronaut explains—yet it's presenting quite a challenge for NASA. See, while the International Space Station has a pretty fancy toilet, an astronaut must wear a diaper during launch and landing activities or while spacewalking. But as NASA looks toward future missions in deep space, it's also looking for a way for astronauts to relieve themselves while remaining in their space suits for up to six days, reports Time. That's where you come in. The agency is offering a $30,000 prize in a ""space poop challenge"" if someone can create ""a system inside a space suit that collects human waste for up to 144 hours and routes it away from the body, without the use of hands."" There are plenty of stipulations. For example, the system ""needs to take no more than five minutes [to set up]"" as an astronaut might be forced to jump into their suit quickly in an emergency, per Space.com. While such a challenge might seem humorous, a solution ""could be the difference between life and death,"" notes the contest website. ""You don't want any of these solids and fluids stuck to your body for six days,"" NASA adds in a release. ""Given enough time, infection, and even sepsis can set in,"" says astronaut Rick Mastracchio in a video. Inventors have until Dec. 20 to submit their entries. NASA plans to test the top entries next year, with a solution executed within three years. (A scientist thinks humans could get to Mars in a month.)","– NASA is offering $30,000 to the winner of its Space Poop Challenge to design a spacesuit that can separate waste from body parts and collect it for up to six days, CNET reports. "" Effectively managing human waste is critical for the health and safety of astronauts in space,"" NASA states. ""It could be the difference between life and death for astronauts in emergency situations that require extended (like days) periods of time."" Right now, astronauts at the International Space Station use a vacuum and tube to help evacuate fecal matter when they pee, Space.com reports. To urinate, they use a funnel attached to a hose that can be adapted for a sitting or standing position, and uses air to move urine away. NASA says future missions ""may require long-duration waste management for use by a suited crew member.""

The hackers, who call themselves Lizard Squad, say they were able to access the device's wireless network through a vulnerability that allows them to ""listen in"" to the heartbeats of patients who have the device hooked up to their chests, Ars Technica reports. The problem is that the makers of the pacemakers don't control the programming of the devices, and researchers at Johns Hopkins got their own test devices from an auction website for as little as $500 to as much as $3,000, reports Gizmodo. The team also found that doctors' monitoring systems didn't require log-in names and passwords when pacemakers connect to them, and the data was stored. ""It's still true that various security researchers have been warning manufacturers about pacemakers' and other cardiac devices' vulnerabilities for years,"" the site notes.

After the Senate majority leader pulled the plug on the GOP plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare on Monday, Trump called him ""weak"" at a dinner with conservative activists at the White House on Monday night, two attendees tell Politico. Trump complained about how Republicans had failed him on the issue, saying he was disappointed that McConnell didn't change the Senate filibuster rule so that only 51 votes are needed to pass legislation. He also complained about McConnell's resistance to changing the rule, which Democrats have been able to use to their advantage. Trump has publicly criticized McConnell before, but this is the first time he's called him out publicly. In a Monday night tweet, Trump slammed the ""fake news media"" for celebrating Moore's win in the Alabama Senate race ""when the reality and truth are that Moore is the most Trumpian senate candidate in America today."" Moore, who will face Democrat Doug Jones in the Dec. 12 election, has said he wants to oust McConnell as majority leader. ""Judge Roy Moore in the US Senate means the END of Mitch McConnell’s reign as Majority Leader,"" he said in a fundraising pitch after the defeat of incumbent Luther Strange, who had Trump's support.

The other members of the family were believed to be Mark and Dana Hart of Woodland, Wash., and Mark's wife, Sarah Hart, who moved to California with their six adopted children last year.

2370,"– Investigators say they've found residue of the chemical Tannerite on the device that injured 29 people in New York City's Chelsea neighborhood on Saturday, the New York Daily News reports. Tannerite is a ""binary explosive,"" meaning it's sold in two inert pieces, a chemistry professor at the University of Rhode Island tells USA Today. That means it can only be detonated by a bullet that hits a high-powered rifle, according to Steve Yerger, an investigator at the company that makes Tannerite. He says he hasn't been able to confirm that Tannerite was found on any of the bombs, and he doesn't know how it could have been used. But an explosives expert at Ramora UK says explosives can be and are made so that they only explode in certain ways. ""That's in keeping with a lot of explosive materials,"" he says. In addition to ammonium nitrate, which is usually used in explosives, Tannerite contains nitrogen and chlorine atoms. Oxygen atoms leave nitrate and perchlorate and bind to aluminum atoms to form aluminum oxide. That's the stuff that gives untreated aluminum its rough, ashy look. In Indiana, state Sen. Jim Merritt has introduced a bill that would ban the sale of Tannerite to anyone under 18 and require retailers to place it behind the counter or in a locked display case.","– The 28-year-old sought in Saturday's bombing in New York City and an explosion in New Jersey is in custody, reports NBC News. Ahmad Khan Rahami, an Afghan immigrant who became a US citizen in 2014, was taken into custody by the FBI in Elizabeth, NJ. Sources tell NBC News that Rahami was living with his father in Elizabeth at the time of the bombing, which injured 29 people. The sources say that the device that failed to detonate was set off by a pressure-cooker device found in a trash can. CBS News reports that Tannerite, the brand name of an explosive compound used in target practice, is easy to find online and could have been used in the New York bombs. Tannerite is defined by the ATF as a ""binary explosive,"" meaning it's sold in two inert pieces—a mix of ammonium nitrate and aluminum powder—which won't explode until they're hit by a bullet. A corporate investigator for Tannerite maker 3M says Tannerite makes it easy for shooters at a range to easily determine whether their shot hit their intended target. He says that in the company's tests, Tannerite can only be detonated by the impact of a high-velocity bullet.",,,

In Wednesday's vote, about two-thirds of the Conservative MPs in the House of Commons wrote in a letter to May saying they no longer believe she is competent to lead the country after Britain leaves the European Union in March. They cite her mishandling of Brexit, her failure to forge a good relationship with the UK's European Union, and her refusal to set a date for the country's departure from the EU.

1741,"– Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity may be kaput. Scientists at CERN, the world's largest physics lab, say they've clocked subatomic particles that appear to travel faster than the speed of light, reports the AP. If true, the discovery would upend the theory, which posits that nothing can move faster than light. “I suspect that the bulk of the scientific community will not take this as a definitive result unless it can be reproduced by at least one and preferably several experiments,” one physicist tells ScienceNOW. CERN's press release refers to the findings as ""one of the most significant scientific achievements in the past 50 years."" The particles in question are called neutrinos, and scientists have detected them using a 1,300-metric-ton particle detector in Italy. Neutrinos come in a number of types, and have recently been seen to switch spontaneously from one type to another. The team measured the travel times of neutrino bunches some 16,000 times, and found that the particles sped up 60 billionths of a second earlier than they would have done if they had traveled at the rate of light. This is a tiny fractional change, just 20 parts in a million, but one that occurs consistently. ""This is the first time that we have been able to show that a neutrino travels at a very high speed in a very short period of time,"" says a study co-author.","– Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity may be kaput.

US District Judge George King in San Francisco ruled that sisters Mildred Hill and Patty Hill, who wrote the song in 1893, gave their rights to it and other songs to Clayton Summy in 1935, when he copyrighted and published them in a book called Song Stories for the Kindergarten. The first reference to the full lyrics appeared in a 1901 article in the Inland Educator and Indiana School Journal, King said, adding that there's no evidence the Hill sisters ever transferred the copyright on the lyrics, which are based on an earlier children's song called ""Good Morning to All."" ""Defendants ask us to find that the Hill Sisters eventually gave Summy Co. the rights in the Lyrics to exploit and protect, but this assertion has no support in the record,"" King wrote, per the Hollywood Reporter. The Hill sisters struck three deals with the Summy Company in the 1940s, one of which gave the younger sister of Patty and Mildred Hill 50% of profits from the performance of the song worldwide, reports Rolling Stone. But the second deal gave the company only rights to movies and dramatic performances, and the third agreement, which is now in the court record, ""contains no references to the transfer of the 'Happy Birthday' lyrics.""

He also became the first director to win best director at both the Baftas and the Razzies, and was nominated for best director for Lynch.

4598,"– When a 36-year-old Florida woman returned home from her honeymoon in Belize two months later, she noticed a red lesion on the left side of her groin. She thought it might have been an insect bite, but when she went to her primary care doctor, she said the lesion was still there after she'd finished her antibiotics, researchers write in the Journal of Investigative Medicine, per Live Science. She went to a number of doctors, including a wound healing specialist and a surgeon, before she figured out what was causing the itching. Dr. Enrico Camporesi said the skin around the lesion looked like there was an egg or bean below it, and he feared it could be a lymph node problem, but the surgeon determined it was actually a botfly larva, which had burrowed into the woman's skin. The larva was removed with local anesthesia and a 5 millimeter incision, and by the time the woman came back for a follow-up appointment a week later, the lesion had been ""completely resolved,"" researchers say. botfly eggs are laid on flies and mosquitoes, which in turn carry the eggs to human skin, where they live for up to 128 days, causing itching, per the researchers, who write that ""patients can feel the larvae.""

The larva had burrowed into the woman's skin from something she'd brought back with her from her trip to Belize, where she had apparently been bitten by an insect. When doctors cut open the lesion, they found the larva with spines and hooks, and they were able to extract it with tweezers. The case report notes that while botfly infestations are rare in the US, they are a problem in Central America, where they're known as ""myiasis.""

On Dec. 5, doctors stopped her ventilator to test if she would ever try to breathe on her own, and she was medically pronounced dead at 9:25am. ""The next day, Paige was not doing well.

He convinced John Boehner to hold a vote on a bill that would defund ObamaCare—but only if McConnell first agreed to hold talks with President Obama and Harry Reid. That didn't happen, and McConnell's call for no such talks proved too much for Boehner.

But when a bipartisan group of senators appeared to be making progress, Harry Reid shut it down and forced McConnell to forge a deal himself. ""It was not a smart play,"" McConnell tells Politico. "" It had no chance of success."" John Boehner: The House speaker had been under fire from conservatives for months for his handling of the shutdown and the debt ceiling fight, but he was finally driven to compromise with Democrats, the New York Times finds.

He had to say, 'Here’s a deal, here’s what we got, and we’re going to get rid of ObamaCare,' and he got caught in the crossfire.""

A study of questionnaires completed as part of America's largest regular student assessment finds that a huge segment of our nation's kids say school is far too simple. Some stats backing up the ""too easy"" refrain, per the Center for American Progress: 37% of 4th-graders find their math work too easy 29% of 8th-graders find that subject too easy as well, as do 51% of civics students and 57% of history students And the trend doesn't stop at middle school. In terms of civics and history, 56% and 55% of 12th-graders said the same thing, respectively; 21% said ditto about math And some of the intel gathered on the amount of work kids do seems to back this up: Nearly a third of 8th-graders say they read less than five pages a day ... in school or as homework. A third also say they write lengthy answers on reading tests two times a year—or less.

3152,"– ""Stereotype of Female Players as inferior is not only false, but it is also a potential cause for unequal participation in digital gaming,"" reads a headline on a Vocativ article about a study that shows women are just as good at video games as their male counterparts. The study in the Frontiers in Psychology looked at two popular massively multiplayer online games—EverQuest II in North America and Chevaliers' Romance III in China—and confirmed prior findings that men and women don't have the same goals in playing video games. They also confirmed that men enjoy competitive games while women prefer cooperative ones, while men appear to embrace the title; women are more likely to choose supportive character classes, such as Priests and Healers while men gravitate toward the Barbarians. But the ultimate measure of a gamer isn't what class or guild he or she identifies with—it's his or her level in the game. After analyzing data from more than 9,000 EverQuest II players and 2,000 Chevalier's Romance III players, the researchers found that players who registered as female reach lower levels, on average, than their male peers. ""Once you take into account all these confounding factors, the gender differences disappear,"" says Cuihua Shen, one of the study's co-authors, in a press release.","– ""There is no gender difference."" That's the takeaway from a new study out of the University of California, Davis, that used data from two massively multiplayer online role-playing games to debunk the long-held stereotype that women aren't as good as men. ""Even though more and more women have become gamers, and more are involved in designing games, gaming communities as a whole are still very hostile toward women,"" says Cuihua ""Cindy"" Shen, lead author of the study in the Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication. ""The prevalent stereotype is that women are not as good of players as men."" To test that stereotype, Shen and her team used anonymous server data from more than 10,000 men and women playing EverQuest II in the US and Chevaliers' Romance III in China. They compared playing time, character choice, and membership in a players' guild, among other factors. ""Once you take into account all these confounding factors, the gender differences disappear,"" says Shen, who has been analyzing game data since 2007. The study is the first to look at how male and female players progress over time in multiplayer games online. Previous research has compared men's and women's performances in short, simple games like a car race in lab settings, reports Vocativ. The study suggests that women who feel alienated from video games could lose out in future careers in science, technology, engineering, and math fields.",,,

5572,"– A group of anti-drug activists is suing Colorado over its legalization of recreational marijuana, claiming the move is in violation of federal law. The Safe Streets group, along with three other plaintiffs, filed two lawsuits in federal court Thursday seeking to shut down Colorado's regulated marijuana industry, the Huffington Post reports. The suits target a number of Colorado lawmakers, including Gov. John Hickenlooper, Revenue Department Executive Director Barbara Brohl, and Marijuana Enforcement Division Director W. Lewis Koski. They allege that by allowing for a regulated marijuana market, these lawmakers are breaking federal law, which considers the plant illegal. But going a step beyond simply suing the state, the plaintiffs—Phillis Windy Hope Reilly, Michael P.

In the Times piece, del Castillo writes that she didn't think much of the fact that the US and Mexican government were watching her and her companions. ""From the moment Kate had gone out on a limb with her tweet of January 2012 through the beginning of our negotiations to meet El Chapo, I had been bewildered by his willingness—'I know one day I will die.

5250,"– The world's first images of the USS Independence have been found off the coast of California more than 70 years after the ship was used as a target for an atomic bomb test. Robert Ballard, the oceanographer who found the Titanic, the Bismarck, the USS Yorktown, and John F. Kennedy's PT-109, found the ship off Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific during World War II, the New York Times reports. The ship was part of a ""Magic Carpet"" fleet that transported war prisoners to the US before Japan's invasion, and it was used in the test explosion at Bikini Atoll on July 1, 1946. The bomb exploded off the ship's port quarter, ""causing massive blast damage in that area, and progressively less further forward,"" according to a press release. After the test, the Independence left Bikini for San Francisco, where it was placed within a half-mile of ground zero for a second explosion. But the ship didn't sink: It was raised in 1995 and spent the next 20 years at the bottom of the ocean as a museum ship. On Tuesday, Ballard found the first images he'd ever seen of the ship, which was sunk by the Japanese in the Battle of Ley. The US Geological Survey found it while mapping the seafloor in 1990, but until now, there had been no photos or video of the Independence in its final resting place. Ballard and his team, working with the Navy and NOAA, took thousands of photos with two unmanned submersibles on Monday and Tuesday. They plan to build a 3-D digital image from the photos.","– More than 70 years after it was used as a target for atomic tests, the USS Independence has been found off the coast of California.

The ship, which saw combat in the Pacific, Okinawa, and the Leyte Gulf during World War II and was present in atomic tests at Bikini Atoll in the South Pacific a year later, was sunk by the Japanese in 1943 just days after the Japanese invasion of the Philippines. The Navy says it is ""deeply sorry"" for the loss of the ship and its crew.

This week, however, thousands of viewers watched as the first photos other than sonar scans of the 623-foot aircraft carrier were shown live online, courtesy of the same ocean explorer who discovered the Titanic, among other famous shipwrecks—and those pics show the Independence is in remarkably good shape in its watery grave. ""There's very little change from when the Navy scuttled it,"" Robert Ballard says of his team's documentation, in conjunction with the Navy and the NOAA, adding the Titanic was similarly well-kept. ""The deep sea is the largest museum on Earth."" Viewers saw such wonders as the Independence's sponge-covered flight deck, a Grumman Hellcat fighter plane, and even the ship's name imprinted on its hull, all at the same time as researchers on the Nautilus exploration vessel, who sent out two remote-controlled submersibles Monday and Tuesday to capture the pictures about 30 miles west of Half Moon Bay.

 President Barack Obama is about to do what no president has done in the past 50 years: Have two horrible, terrible, awful midterm elections in a row. 
 
 In fact, Obama is likely to have the worst midterm numbers of any two-term president going back to Democrat Harry S. Truman.

Consider that Democrats lost 63 seats in the 2010 midterms are expected to lose five to 12 (or maybe more) seats on Tuesday. No president has lost as many in back-to-back midterms since Harry Truman lost 83 in 1946 and 1950, writes Stuart Rothenberg. Dwight Eisenhower managed to lose a total of 66, but Obama seems on track to top him. More typical is the pattern of Bill Clinton, who lost 54 in 1994 but bounced back with a gain of five in 1998. Still, if Tuesday is shaping up to be a night of celebration for the GOP, Politico offers a reality check, at least in the Senate: Several first-term Republicans in vulnerable states will be up for re-election in 2016. So even if Republicans win a small majority this year, they might have to give it right back two years later.","– The first polls close at 6pm Eastern, and it's safe to say that Democrats are in for a rough night, writes Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post. Republicans are expected to pick up seats in Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Montana, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, while Democrats are likely to lose seats in Alaska, Nevada, New Hampshire, and Virginia. Most recent presidents have had one disastrous midterm and another midterm that was not terrible. The GOP lost 30 House seats ... but gained 8 seats in George W. Bush's second midterm ... and a net loss of 31 seats. Democrats got shellacked in 1994, losing 54 seats in Bill Clinton’s first midterm ... but the party gained 5 House seats that year, for a net Clinton loss of 49 House seats.

Aiello told police he was outside his own home a few hours later and saw Navarra drive by and honk with someone else in the passenger seat of her car. But surveillance footage from Aiello's home between 3:12pm and 3:33pm didn't show her car ever leaving in the direction Aiello said it did. Navarra was wearing a Fitbit, which can collect data like number of steps walked and heart rate, when she walked to her job as a pharmacy technician.

The tweet came after Trump met with the CEOs of Boeing and Lockheed Martin on Wednesday, the AP reports. Lockheed is building the US Air Force's next generation of F-35 fighter jets, and Trump has complained about the $379 billion cost of the program. ""We're trying to get costs down,"" Trump said after the meeting. ""It's a very, very expensive program.""

Lockheed was supposed to deliver 2,443 of the jets to the United States, UK, and five other countries by 2030, Business Insider reports. Instead, the Pentagon has orders for 2,454, and it's expected to deliver them by 2029.

But the court didn't rule on the legality of the president's entire ban, which affects travelers from Iran, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen.

But when a co-worker tried to rent out the apartment for a Packers game, Amy Joy Lasee denied the request and the apartment was pulled from Airbnb ""because we wanted to,"" Lasee says. ""We didn't want everyone in the world looking at it."" The problem is that Lasee lists his home as being in Racine, about 60 miles away, while his wife owns a home in De Pere, which is assessed at $262,000. If he were to declare Racine as his home, he would have to take Paul Ryan to Washington, DC—""that, of course, would be political suicide,"" the Journal Sentinel notes. Lasee is running against businessman and former Marine Mike Gallagher, who has a big lead in the polls, Roll Call reports.","– A Republican state lawmaker in Wisconsin is taking heat over an Airbnb listing that suggests he lives in another state. State Sen. Robert Lasee, who is running for a congressional seat, listed an apartment in De Pere as available for rent on Airbnb, reports the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The problem is that Lasee and his wife, Amy, own a house in Racine, which is about 60 miles away from the De Pere address. Lasee says he has a ""crazy living arrangement"" in which he sometimes stays at his wife's house, though he acknowledges that he lives most of the time in his De Pere apartment. ""Yes, it's difficult,"" he says. ""It is what it is."" Lasee is running against businessman and former Marine Mike Gallagher, who has the support of Gov. Scott Walker's presidential campaign, Roll Call reports. Ribble, a fellow Republican, is retiring, and the election is expected to favor the GOP nominee. In 2014, Democrats filed a complaint about Lasee's residence, but the complaint was dismissed by the state's Government Accountability Board, which found that the Lasees didn't violate any laws because they weren't allowed to rent out their place to others without the owner's consent, the New York Daily News reports.","Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

They dealt with Amy Joy Lasee, Frank's wife, who asked why they wanted to stay there and ultimately denied their request. Why did they pull the listing? ""Because we wanted to,"" says Lasee, who adds that they didn't want ""everyone in the world looking at it."" He then described a ""crazy living arrangement"" involving him mostly shacking up at the apartment and sometimes in Racine. This isn't new for Lasee, who had to produce a lease in 2014 when pressed by Democrats wanting evidence that he wasn't subletting the apartment. In a response to the state's Government Accountability Board, he said custody arrangements and the challenges of a ""blended family"" forced him to retain both residences. Yet he has switched his official residence a few times between Racine and De Pere during various divorce and child custody proceedings.

4344,"– Hoverboard explosions and house fires have prompted Amazon to stop selling most hoverboards on its websites in the US and the UK, the Verge reports. The online retailer sent out an email to merchants asking them to ""provide documentation demonstrating that all hoverboards you list are compliant with applicable safety standards, including UN 38.3 (battery), UL 1642 ( battery), and UL 60950-1 (charger),"" according to a statement from Swagway, one of the biggest sellers of the boards. Hoverboard importers Swagway and Smartrax tell the Verge they are in the process of working on measures to help consumers identify between authentic and imitation boards, and they ask that consumers only purchase from authorized retailers as an added precaution. The United States Consumer Product Safety Commission has received at least 10 reports of hoverboard fires in recent weeks, and nine airlines have announced they'll ban the boards from flights, USA Today reports. Razor, the maker of the most popular hoverboard models, has filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Amazon, claiming the boards infringe on its patent.","– The ""Back to the Future""-style hoverboards that have become a hot item this holiday season are no longer available on Amazon. The online retailer started pulling the self-balancing scooters from its shelves on Monday after a recent explosion at a mall in Washington state was followed by similar incidents in California, Ohio, Louisiana, Alabama, California, Texas, Pennsylvania, Florida, New York, and Washington, according to the New York Daily News. Amazon isn't the only retailer taking action: eBay and Overstock.com have also stopped selling hoverboards, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission says it's investigating at least 10 reports of hoverboard fires in nine states, the Indianapolis Star reports. In Washington state, a hoverboard exploded in a shopping mall last week, injuring one person. A spokesman for the CPSC says hoverboards ""often contain battery varieties above the government mandated 160 watt-hour limit permitted aboard aircraft."" And in Britain, the Chartered Trading Standards Institute warned earlier this month that 88% of hoverboards imported from outside the EU failed basic safety checks, the Verge reports. ""Some products that are made abroad, principally for the overseas market, are not fitted with the correct plug and fuse for use in the UK,"" the group said.

4,"– The Supreme Court kicks off its new term today, and there's no shortage of cases on its docket. Here's a look at some of the bigger ones, via the AP, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, SCOTUSblog, and the Washington Post: Abortion: The court could rule as soon as next month on whether states can regulate abortion clinics. A lower court had already struck down a key part of California's law, but a ruling in favor of the state could open the door to similar laws in other states. Unions: If the court rules against them, public sector unions could be in big trouble. The case revolves around California teachers who say forcing them to pay union dues violates their First Amendment rights. Lawyers for the unions argue that they should have to get permission before collecting dues for political purposes. The court has previously ruled that government workers can't be forced to join unions, but this case asks it to overturn a 38-year-old precedent that allowed all workers covered by union negotiations to be charged for representation.

2655,"– The number of hikers attempting to complete the 2,650-mile Pacific Crest Trail in a single year is on the rise, with more than 4,000 permits issued so far this year, up from just 300 in 2006, reports Outside magazine. That's partly because of the movie Wild, which tells the story of hiker Cheryl Strayed's attempt to walk the trail from California to Oregon. ""There are a whole lot of people that are going to be inspired to hit the PCT because of Wild and we really care about making sure that people are traveling safely,"" a rep for the trail's association tells the magazine. Still, overcrowding is an issue. ""Deserts are fragile,"" an expert tells Outside. ""They're more susceptible to damage and when damage occurs, it lasts longer."" And that's why the number of permits issued under a quota system that caps them at 50 per day was only introduced in 2015. ""As a direct response to the spike in numbers, the main aim of the quota system is to spread the numbers out and wear on the trail and environmental damage,"" outdoors writer Pete Brook writes in the Los Angeles Times. ""This is especially important in the desert environments that dominate."" There are no official numbers on how many hikers use the trail each year, but 2,800 long-distance permits were issued in 2015. Of those, approximately 1,200 made the trip to Canada. ""No one wants to envision a day when hikers are denied the opportunity to walk,"" writes Matt Miller at Outside.","– The number of people attempting to hike the entire 2,650-mile Pacific Crest Trail in a single year has more than doubled since the release of Cheryl Strayed's Wild four years ago, the Atlantic reports. According to Outside magazine, there were just 300 thru-hikers—those who attempted the trail by foot—attempting the entire trail in 2006. That number has spiked to more than 4,000 so far this year. ""I hear from women who are inspired by Wild,"" a rep for the Pacific Crest trail association tells Outside. ""And who knows what this season will bring."" There are no official statistics on the number of women hikers on the trail, but Outside reports anecdotal evidence suggests they're on the rise. ""There are definitely more women out hiking,"" the rep says. The San Francisco Chronicle reports there are 3,000 hikers attempting the Northbound thru-hike during the eight-week window between mid-March and mid-May, while a few hundred more are heading Southbound between July and November. The quota system was put in place in 2015, with a cap of 50 permits per day set for the first 700 miles of the trail. If damage became significant, we'd think about putting in shelters like on the Appalachian Trail. We're actually trying to avoid that, but the idea is not off the table."" But not everyone is thrilled with the new system. ""The only thing when a permitted hiker may hit the trail is the honor system,"" Outside quotes a PCTA rep as saying. ""It may not hold.""","The subtitle for Cheryl Strayed’s memoir Wild is “From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail”. For those not familiar with the story, Strayed finds herself on a course of self-destructive behavior which she attempts to redirect by hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. The not-too-subtle implication here is that for those whose have made poor life decisions and whose are on a path of recklessness, then just go hike a long distance trail and everything will work out. In Cheryl Strayed’s case, it seem...","– Hikers on the Pacific Crest Trail can expect to encounter harsh-but-beautiful landscapes, extreme fatigue, and—these days, at least—traffic. ""You can’t talk about the Pacific Crest Trail without mentioning the crowds,"" Pete Brook writes for Outside. He should know: Brook currently is trekking the 2,650-mile PCT, which runs from the Mexican border through California, Oregon, and Washington to the border with Canada. But don't take his word for it: The Pacific Crest Trail Association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail. To put things in perspective: 300 people attempted to complete the entire PCT in 2006, according to the AP, with about 120 of those making it. In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the PCTA's Jack Haskel told the AP in 2015. But after the movie, starring Reese Witherspoon, was released in 2014, interest in the PCT exploded. ""Millions are hearing about it now and are being inspired,"" Haskel said. Strayed, more or less unprepared for the journey, hiked 1,100 miles of the trail as a form of therapy as she grappled with personal demons. ""However for others that follow her strategy of deliberate ineptitude, things might not turn out so well,"" writes DontHikeLikeWild.org. ""Our advice to would-be hikers: Grow a spine first. Then get out there and hike the PCT."" (This female hiker is the ""biggest badass you've never heard of."")","– When Cheryl Strayed set out to hike the 2,650-mile Pacific Crest Trail in her memoir Wild, she didn't think she'd make it that far. But she did—and now she's raising money to help other would-be hikers get there, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. The trail is open to all, but ""those that choose to arrive unprepared can quickly find themselves in situations on the trail that begin to negatively affect others, as well as the trail environment,"" writes Kelly Servick at Outside. ""An influx of inexperienced, and often careless wanderers may invariably add strain to the fragile natural and human resources on which hikers rely. Likewise even some experienced hikers are often responsible for inappropriate behavior and the resulting often sour reputation of hiker trash."" So far, donations are mostly in the form of food, water, and gear for those hoping to make it to the end of the trail in June. (The movie Wild, starring Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern, tells the story of Strayed's 1,100-mile trek as she recovered from drug abuse, divorce, and her mother's death.)"

2171,"– Scientists are reporting in the journal Science Translational Medicine that they've successfully reversed Down syndrome in mice by injecting them with an experimental compound that causes the brain to grow normally. ""It worked beautifully,"" says lead author Roger Reeves of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ""We were able to completely normalize growth of the cerebellum through adulthood with that single injection."" The mice were genetically engineered to have extra copies of about half of the genes found on human chromosome 21, which in turn leads to Down syndrome-like conditions such as smaller brains and difficulty learning to navigate a maze, AFP reports. The researchers injected the mice with a small molecule known as a sonic hedgehog pathway agonist. The compound, which has not been proven safe for human use, is designed to boost normal growth via a gene known as SHH. The gene provides instructions for making a protein called sonic hedgehog, which is essential for development. The injection also led to unexpected benefits in learning and memory, normally handled by a different part of the brain known as the hippocampus. ""Down syndrome is very complex, and nobody thinks there's going to be a silver bullet that normalizes cognition,"" says Reeves.","– Scientists at Johns Hopkins say they've discovered a way to help mice with Down syndrome grow their cerebellums—the part of the brain that plays a key role in learning and memory.

""What we didn't expect were the effects on learning and Memory, which are generally controlled by the hippocampus, not the cerebellum."" The mice were genetically engineered to have extra copies of about half of the genes found on human chromosome 21. The researchers injected a compound called a sonic hedgehog pathway agonist into them just once on the day of birth, while their hedgehogs were still developing. They were able to ""completely normalize growth of the cerebellum through adulthood with that single injection,"" says the researcher. The study, published in Science Translational Medicine, was funded in part by the Down Syndrome Research and Treatment Foundation, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, and the National Institutes of Health. But the researchers say it's far from a ""cure"" for Down syndrome.

4322,"– Just when you thought microwave popcorn couldn't get any worse, a new study in the journal Chemical Research in Toxicology finds a link between a chemical called diacetyl and Alzheimer's disease. Diacetyl is a synthetic butter flavoring used in microwave popcorn, baked goods, pet foods, some fast foods, and other food products. It's harmless when consumed, but when heated to high temperatures, it turns into toxic fumes and has been linked to severe obstructive lung disease known as ""popcorn lung."" In fact, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health even issued a health alert for factory workers after investigating people who had developed bronchiolitis obliterans, a lung disease characterized by fixed airway obstruction. ""Not only can it pass through the blood-brain barrier, which is intended to help keep toxins out of your brain, but it can also cause brain proteins to misfold into the Alzheimer’s-linked form known as beta amyloid. It also inhibits mechanisms that help to naturally clear the dangerousbeta amyloid from your brain,"" writes Dr. Mehmet Oz in a post at Oz.com. Researchers looked at more than 100 microwave- and stove-top popcorn products and found that, on average, microwave popcorn contains twice as much salt as non- microwave popcorn and nearly three times as much trans fat, the Los Angeles Times reports. The researchers, who used a food processor to crush the kernels, also found that the amount of trans fat in popcorn was almost identical to that in non-popcorn. While they don't ""have any evidence to support a causal relationship between the consumption of trans fats and heart attacks, they believe there is no evidence of a causal link between trans fats, which may be dangerous, which could be dangerous—the result of a combination of a trans.","– Just when you thought microwave popcorn couldn't get any worse, Sari Harrar writes for the Huffington Post that the stuff may actually be worse than you thought. The synthetic butter flavoring known as diacetyl has been linked to lung disease known as ""popcorn lung,"" and it's not just the factory workers who are exposed to it. In fact, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health had begun investigating people who worked in microwave popcorn factories who had developed bronchiolitis obliterans (a lung disease characterized by fixed airway obstruction), and the results revealed the cause of the disease was something back at the factory—specifically exposure to an artificial flavoring agent: 2,3-butanedione or diacetyl. It was evident 'Popcorn lung' was a problem, with NIOSH even issuing a health alert for workers, complete with preventive steps and an exposure limit guideline. Another problem is the presence of chemicals like perfluoroalkyls, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluoro sulfonate (PFOS), which are used to line the popcorn bags to prevent grease from soaking the bag wet. On heating, these chemicals fuse into the popcorn you eat. They mess up your endocrine system, causes thyroid issues, bladder cancer, and— Consumerist reports—have been found to cause lung problems in rats and gene damage in their brains. The makers of microwave popcorn have announced that they'll be replacing diacetyl with another flavoring that won't be any better.",,,

""Our research found that black boys can be seen as responsible for their actions at an age when white boys still benefit from the assumption that children are essentially innocent."" Researchers interviewed 264 mostly white, female college students and found that they were most likely to be the ones who had a record of using force on black children in custody, the Los Angeles Times reports. They also found that white students tended to see black children ages 10 and older as "" significantly less innocent.""

""In the very situation in which most need their training,"" says researcher Josh Correll, ""we have some reason to believe that their training will be to use force when necessary."" The study comes in the wake of several high-profile deaths of black people at the hands of white police officers.

""We will not let those who seek to do so use it as an excuse to continue to kill and injure our police officers,"" he tweeted.","Over the holiday weekend, a group of predominantly white militiamen took up guns and began occupying the government's Malheur National Wildlife Refuge headquarters in Oregon, culminating in a tense standoff with law enforcement in the area.

It's a case of ""implicit bias,"" writes Lopez, or ""subconscious prejudices that can change how we approach and treat people of a different race, ethnicity, and religious affiliation."" It's important that media outlets be aware of the problem, he adds, because the resulting coverage can skew how stories are perceived.

1840,"– Jupiter is set to shine brighter than any star in the night sky for the entire year starting at 6am ET tonight, Space.com reports. The gas giant will appear as the sun rises, and as long as skies are clear, you'll be able to spot it from dusk to dawn. Jupiter will also be at its closest tonight, meaning even those without telescopes can get a great view. Right now, Jupiter lingers in the southern regions of the constellation, shining nearly 30 times brighter than the nearby star Regulus. If Jupiter alone isn't enough of a treat, its moons should provide plenty of entertainment. Upwards of 60 different moons orbit the gas giant, but are usually too tiny to spot with the naked eye. The four largest moons (Io, Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa) are visible alongside Jupiter even with just a set of binoculars. First observed by Galileo Galilei in 1610, the four moons, which are known as the ""Galilean Moons,"" are some of the solar system's most intriguing objects. According to NASA, Io is the most volcanically active object in our solar system, and is shrouded in thick clouds of multicolored sulfur. Europa, on the other hand, is cloaked by ... sulfur.","– Get ready for a treat: Jupiter is about to be the brightest planet in the night sky for the entire year.

The planet will be visible in Leo, the lion of the constellation Leo, from 6am to 9am ET tonight, and will continue to shine bright through the night.

Instead, most of the attention is focused on the shooting violence that occurred elsewhere in the city, leaving more than 60 injured and 10 dead between Friday evening and Monday morning, reports WLS-TV. The worst of it took place in a three-hour span starting around midnight Saturday when 30 people were shot, reports the Sun-Times. Of those victims, 25 were injured in five mass shootings. Police say gang violence is mostly to blame, with shooters taking advantage of large gatherings in the summer weather to inflict the most casualties. ""If they shoot you, they don’t even run,” one man tells the Chicago Tribune. ""They just walk away, they ain’t trying to run."" A police spokesman says the extra police presence at the music festival did not play a role in the violence because officers working it were generally on their regular days off and on OT. The violence prompted Rudy Giuliani to enter the fray with a series of tweets backing Garry McCarthy, a former Chicago police chief who hopes to unseat Mayor Rahm Emanuel.

Giuliani called McCarthy a ""policing genius"" thanks to his work with the data-centric CompStat system, adding, ""Chicago murders are direct result of one party Democratic rule for decades.""

The Syrian foreign ministry accused the US of “interfering in its affairs” by going to Hama without prior permission. “The presence of the US ambassador in Hama without previous permission is obvious evidence of a clear evidence of the United States’ involvement in current events in Syria and its attempt to incite an escalation in the situation, which disturbs Syria’s security and stability,” the ministry said in a statement.

1875,"– Did the CIA lie to the Warren Commission about Lee Harvey Oswald's role in the assassination of John F. Kennedy? A newly declassified report by the CIA's top in-house historian suggests that CIA Director John McCone was at the heart of a ""benign cover-up,"" Politico reports. McCone, who died in 1991, testified that the CIA had no evidence to suggest Oswald was part of a foreign conspiracy, foreign or domestic, and the commission agreed. But the report found that the commission never knew if Oswald had accomplices in Cuba or elsewhere who wanted Kennedy dead in retaliation for CIA plots to assassinate Fidel Castro. Without this information, the commission didn't even know to ask the question of whether Oswald was working with accomplices. The report offers no conclusion about McCone's motivations, including why he would go to lengths to cover up CIA activities that mostly predated his time at the agency. But it suggests that the Johnson White House might have directed McCone to hide the information, denying information to the commission that might have prompted a more aggressive investigation of Oswald'—McCone ""may be regarded as a 'co-conspirator' in the JFK assassination 'cover-ups,'"" the report states. Click here for more.","– The CIA may have been involved in a ""cover-up"" on the eve of JFK's assassination, according to a new report from the Committee to Protect Journalists. The report, based on previously undisclosed documents, says CIA agent Robert McCone told the Warren Commission, which investigated the assassination, that he had no idea that the CIA was involved in plots to kill Fidel Castro and Martin Luther King Jr. McCone's testimony ""was neither frank nor accurate"" because other CIA officials ""withheld the information from me,"" the report says. ""I have never been satisfied as to why they withheld the information."" The report doesn't say why McCone hid information, but it suggests he was ordered to do so by the Johnson White House, the New York Times reports.

2706,"– Depressed people might want to check their Instagram photos for signs of depression, according to a new study out of Harvard and the University of Vermont. Reporting in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, the researchers say they were able to identify 70% of cases of depression with the help of a computer system that analyzed 13,000 photos from 166 Instagram users, some of whom were clinically depressed. ""These findings suggest new avenues for early screening and detection of mental illness,"" the researchers write, though they add that much more work needs to be done before that can become a reality. ""It's all a good thing,"" Michael Thase, the director of the Mood and Anxiety Program at theUniversity of Pennsylvania, tells CNNMoney. ""But it's only not a bad thing when the information would be sold to somebody who might make a buck from interfacing with depressed people."" In the study, depressed Instagram users posted photos with increased hue, decreased brightness, and decreased color saturation. They also used more Instagram filters, like Inkwell, which turns a photo black-and-white, more frequently, and had more faces in their photos than non-depressed Instagram users. The computer was trained by looking at the photos' brightness, vividness, hue, and whether an Instagram filter was used. ""If someone posts a dark, bluish photo to Instagram, it shouldn't necessarily be a red flag for their therapist—that person could just like photos of whales, or blueberries,"" researchers say in a press release.

The depressed participants were more likely to post photos that include faces, but their photos tended to have fewer faces than Instagram users who weren't depressed. This could be an indication that depressed people have smaller social circles, the researchers say.

The Instagram users in the study took a clinical depression survey and were asked about any history of depression, according to Fortune. CNN reports the computer program was able to correctly detect depression from a person's Instagram account 70% of the time. That's better than humans looking at Instagram photos and better than the success rate of general practitioners diagnosing depression.

Depressed people tended to use the Inkwell filter most often (non-depressed people preferred Valencia) and got more comments on their posts (non-depressed people got more likes). Depressed people also posted more photos of faces but had fewer faces per photo.

""Mic is an aberration,"" he writes. ""Words like that aren't pronounced like that.""

""What finally pushed me from acceptance to action on gender- neutral pronouns was the increasing visibility of gender- Neutral people."" The move comes after numerous publications, including the Baltimore Sun and Pittsburgh City Paper, have adopted the use of ""they"" as singular pronouns for stories about people who identify as neither. They, as in ""they,"" instead of ""he,"" is the choice. It's been in use since at least the 1300s, reports Megan McArdle at Quartz. They have been used to refer to a single person or a group of people for centuries. ""There's just no good reason to embrace it,"" she writes.","– The Washington Post is following in the footsteps of the New York Times and adopting a singular pronoun for ""people who identify as neither male nor female.""

But had she submitted that line to a modern English teacher, she would have gotten docked for grammar. Instead of ""when they fall in love,"" it should be ""when he falls in love,"" or perhaps the clunkier ""when he or she falls in love,"" right? That has long been the prevailing view, but after a slow and steady creep, that view seems to be disappearing. In fact, this year might be the tipping point for acceptance of the ""singular they."" Quartz, for example, has dubbed singular they its Word of the Year. And earlier this month, the Washington Post changed its style guide to accept it, though the guide still encourages reporters to first try to write around it by recasting the sentence as plural, notes Poynter. So, ""All students must complete their homework, not Each student must complete his or her homework,"" per the guide. But when that kind of rewrite is ""impossible or hopelessly awkward,"" writers should employ the singular they. One big factor behind the shift—not just at the Post but in newspapers, online posts, and English classrooms across the country—is the increasing acceptance in society of those who identify as neither male nor female. The singular they solves the problem. (On a related note, the New York Times now permits ""Mx."" as a gender-neutral honorific in place of Mr. or Ms., notes Quartz.) Grammatical purists may protest, but they are simply wrong, writes English teacher Anne Curzan at the Chronicle for Higher Education. ""There is nothing grammatically wrong with singular they other than the fact that people say there is something wrong with it,"" she writes, noting the similarity to the outdated rule, still enforced in places, about not splitting infinitives.

The style change has been met with—you'll no longer see ""email,"" ""open-mike nights,"" or ""Walmart,"" Mashable reports. But the spellings are changing, too. Starting today, ""microphone"" and “mic"" will be the new spellings, and the style manual will be updated to reflect that. ""Mic doesn't exist in isolation. Some now-common phrases— mic drop, hot mic—would look downright anachronistic with the old spelling,"" says editor Dean Baquet. ""That reality was what finally."""
1083,"– The US is stepping up weapons deliveries to ""moderate"" Syrian rebels, according to US and European security officials. Most of the weapons are small arms and anti-tank rockets, but not surface-to-air missiles, which could shoot down military or civilian aircraft, officials tell Reuters. The US stopped sending lethal aid to the rebels last summer over fears the weapons would end up in the hands of Islamist militants, but officials say they're now more sure that weapons are going to moderate groups rather than jihadist ones. Congress also approved funding for months of more deliveries, sources say. ""The Syrian war is a stalemate. The rebels lack the organization and weapons to defeat Assad; the regime lacks the loyal manpower to suppress the rebellion,"" a former senior CIA analyst tells the New York Times. ""Both sides' external allies ... are ready to supply enough money and arms to fuel the stalemate for the foreseeable future."" Meanwhile, Islamist rebels and extremist groups in Syria are profiting from the war, American officials tell the Times. The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, and the Nusra Front, both of which are offshoots of al-Qaeda, have seized control of most of the nation's oil and gas fields, turning what was once an essential source of income for Syria into a driving force in a war that is tearing the country apart.

2902,"– If the world wants to avoid the worst of climate change, it's going to have to ease up on the takeoffs. That's according to a new study in Climatic Change that finds rising temperatures will make it harder for some planes to take off in the hottest parts of the day. The New York Times reports the study found that 10% to 30% of fully loaded planes will have to dump some weight if takeoffs aren't possible on the hottest days. ""Our results suggest that weight restriction may impose a non-trivial cost on airline and impact aviation operations around the world,"" study author Ethan Coffel says in a Columbia University press release. The problem is that air is getting thinner as it warms, and that thin air means less lift for the plane's wings, which then race along the runway. The study—which looked at 20 busiest airports in the US, Europe, the Mideast, China, and south Asia—predicts that by 2080, maximum daily temperatures at airports worldwide will be up 4 to 8 degrees Celsius (7.2 to 14.4 degrees Fahrenheit) by.

Tepco officials say it will take till the end of 2016 to pry all six covers off, and till at least 2020 to remove the nearly 300 spent fuel rods lurking underneath. The project, which was supposed to commence last July, was previously postponed because of fears of radiation escaping. ""For the safety of Fukushima's residents, we would like the work to proceed with extra care,"" says the chief of a group of monitors overseeing the project. The total cost and time for the entire decommissioning assignment: tens of billions of dollars over 30 years or so, NBC notes. Meanwhile, the Japanese government today approved an increase in compensation payments to Tepco to a total of $57.2 billion, Reuters reports. That's $7.7 billion added onto the $49.5 billion in taxpayer-funded aid that Tepco had previously been approved to receive. (Check out more details about the decommissioning project on Tepco's dedicated website.)","– The last of the tanks holding radioactive water at Japan's Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant has been removed, marking the beginning of what could be a decades-long process to get the plant back on its feet, Reuters reports. The tank that held the water, which had melted away in the wake of the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, was taken out by workers on Sunday, the first time it has been taken out since the plant was crippled. According to the AP, the tank's removal is part of a plan by plant operator Tokyo Electric Power to bring the plant under control by the end of this year. It's estimated it will cost tens of billions of dollars to remove the melted fuel from the wrecked reactors and clean up the site, which the government plans to revoke evacuation orders for most people within two years."

3630,"– Opioids like OxyContin and Percocet are often prescribed to treat chronic pain, but a new study finds they can also lead to long-term, potentially deadly opioid use. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they examined the medical records of nearly 500,000 Medicare beneficiaries who visited an emergency department for an opioid prescription between 2008 and 2011. They found that patients who received an opioids prescription from an emergency medicine physician were more likely to be prescribed the drugs within 30 days of their emergency department visit than patients who got them from a physician who didn't bill for emergency department visits, reports the Los Angeles Times. The rate of ""long-term opioid use""—defined as more than 180 days of use—was 10.3% higher for patients prescribed opioids than for those who received them from physicians who did not bill for ER visits. The researchers say the findings suggest that physicians should be more careful when prescribing opioids to patients with chronic pain.

In a New England Journal of Medicine study, researchers found that patients whose ER doctors are more likely to prescribe opioids are more likely to develop an addiction compared to the patients of ER doctors who prescribe less frequently. It may sound like an obvious chain of events, but it remains unclear why two patients given the same opioid prescription after similar complaints have different addiction risks depending on their ER doc. The takeaway is ""not that high-intensity prescribers are necessarily irresponsible in prescribing opioids to certain patients,"" the lead author tells the New York Times. But ""their patients have worse outcomes that we weren’t aware of before."" After tracking 375,000 Medicare patients in ERs between 2008 and 2011, researchers found that one in every 48 patients prescribed opioids ends up using them long-term, or more than half a year. But when comparing ""high-intensity"" prescribing docs (who gave opioids to one in four patients) to ""low-intensity"" prescribers (one in 14), patients of the first group had a 30% greater risk of turning into long-time users. It may be a simple numbers game, as observed in a post at Pacific Standard: ""The more prescriptions doctors give out, the more likely they'll end up handing a script to someone who will have a serious problem later."" But one doctor sees a larger issue: Among ER doctors, there's no consensus ""about when to prescribe opioids and what dose to give."" (This is how long it takes to become dependent.)","– Opioid prescriptions are on the rise in the US, and a new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine finds that some doctors are writing more prescriptions than others even within their own hospitals. Researchers looked at the prescribing habits of more than 54,000 patients in 93 hospitals across the US and found that the ""highest and lowest prescribers"" in each hospital prescribed the most opioids, per a press release. The rate of ""high-intensity"" prescribers—those who write the most prescriptions but who have the least number of emergency department visits—was 10.3%, while the rate for ""low-intensity,"" or doctors who write only a few ER visits a year, was 5.2%. ""The bottom line is that we're seeing a lot of physicians who are not qualified to be prescribers of opioids,"" one of the study's authors tells the New York Times. ""And that's a problem."" The researchers found that patients who saw a doctor who wrote at least 10 prescriptions in a two-year period were twice as likely to be prescribed an opioid for chronic pain than patients whose doctors wrote fewer than five prescriptions. And the more often a doctor wrote a prescription, the more likely the patient was to chronically use the drugs. The study doesn't prove a cause-and-effect link, but researchers say the findings suggest that doctors should be more careful about who they give opioids."

414,"– It's been 50 years since mice first arrived on New Zealand's Antipodes Island, but they're still a pest—so much so that the island has been declared mouse-free for the first time, Phys.org reports. The mice arrived on the island via shipwrecks and sealing ships in the 1800s, wiping out two species of insect and pushing some sea birds to breed on nearby islands. A $4 million project to get rid of the mice started in 1980, and the last mouse was caught in 2010. ""I am proud to look back and see how far we've come in just 10 years,"" says the project's leader. Researchers are working on a technique called the Trojan Female Technique, which targets mitochondria, the tiny power plants inside cells, which can impair the ability of sperm to swim. Females carrying the mutations would have sterile male offspring, but their daughters would be able to breed, producing yet more. Twenty-one species of breeding seabirds, including the critically endangered Antipodean wandering albatross, nearly one in five unique to the islands, will be among the beneficiaries of the successful eradication project, says conservation minister Eugenie Sage. ""They can now thrive with mice no longer preying on.""","– Researchers in New Zealand are working on a novel way to wipe out invasive species—and they're hoping Trojan female possums will help. The idea is to infect females with genetic mutations that impair their ability to swim. They'd have sterile male offspring, but their daughters would be able to breed, producing more sterile males. It's a ""coup de grce,"" says ecologist Daniel Tompkins, who's working on the project with the government's Landcare Research institute. ""Once the numbers are small, releasing a few Trojan females would cap population, he says. Those small populations might then simply die out naturally, or survive at such low levels that they would no longer pose a threat to native species."" Tompkins and his colleagues have already shown in computer models and lab experiments that this technique can work in fruit flies, where a single release kept population numbers low over 10 generations, with no sign of natural selection fighting back. But in mammals, releasing thousands of Trojan female rats would be counterproductive, because they'd be just as much of a danger to the ecosystem as the ones you're trying to get rid of. In New Zealand, poison is used to kill the pests, but it can kill game animals like deer and pigs, reports National Geographic.

They caused a big threat to the World Heritage Site by preying on native birds, bugs, and plants, and the five-year effort to do away with them got an assist from the public, with the ""Million Mouse Project"" fundraising campaign bringing six figures. The Department of Conservation explains that cereal bait laced with rodent toxin was dropped via helicopter on the island during the winter of 2016. A team scoured the island last month looking for any mice and found none. ""This is huge news for conservation both in New Zealand and internationally,"" says New Zealand Conservation Minister Eugenie Sage. She says more than two dozen types of birds, 21 uncommon plants, and more than 150 insect species will benefit. Both Radio New Zealand and NPR note the mice originally found their way to the Antipodes either on 19th-century ships or via a shipwreck and proceeded to purge the island of at least two insect species, as well as to displace some seabirds to other islands. The initiative in the Antipodes isn't a stand-alone: The island nation has also gotten rid of other invasive species in the name of boosting biodiversity, including goats, rats, cats, rabbits, and a local meat-eating weasel. New Zealand's ultimate goal is to rid itself completely of all invasive pests by 2050, per Nature.

Though it offers no definitive link between Zika and fetal abnormalities, the study does produce the first evidence of virus transmission from mother to child and ""the strongest evidence yet that the virus causes abnormally small heads and incomplete brain development,"" reports the Verge. The study centers on a 25-year-old Slovenian woman who became pregnant while volunteering in Brazil in February 2015. She developed a high fever and rash during her 13th week of pregnancy, but ultrasounds at 14 and 20 weeks showed no issues. When she returned to Slovenia in October, however, doctors found extensive brain damage in the fetus and the pregnancy was aborted, per NBC News. An autopsy found the full genome of the Zika virus exclusively in the fetus' unusually smooth and scarred brain, suggesting the virus only attacked nerve tissue, per Reuters. The mother had no family history of genetic abnormalities and the fetus tested negative for 13 other viruses known to cause birth defects. ""You have a mother who's infected, a fetus that's abnormal, and in the fetus, you have the genetic signature of the virus,"" says an infectious disease expert. ""This is clear data showing Zika can infect the fetus."" An epidemiologist adds ""it sounds like a pretty clear case of extreme microcephaly."" Scientists suspect brain development may have stopped around 20 weeks, leading one doctor to suggest that Zika, like other viruses linked to birth defects, may be most dangerous in the early stages of pregnancy. (The virus has been linked to other health problems.)","– The Zika virus may be behind a spike in microcephaly and other birth defects in Brazil, according to a study published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.

The findings help ""strengthen the biologic association"" between Zika virus infection and microcephaly, researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston wrote in an editorial accompanying the study.

Elizabeth had been getting the cards since 1952, and happened to meet Simes' grandpa at a reception in Turkey in 1972—whereupon she told him, ""so it's you who keeps sending me those lovely Christmas cards,"" Simes says.

Republican officials admit that their in-house tracking polls show Obama with a high-single-digits lead in crucial battleground state Ohio. While Mitt Romney can win the presidency without Ohio, it would be very tough. “Their map has many more routes to victory,” said a leading Republican official. The biggest worry for Democrats at this point is that the 6% to 8% of voters who are still undecided are overwhelmingly white, middle-aged, and economically stressed—bad demographics for Obama. But with polls showing a small but clear bounce for Obama, the president is now a ""reasonably clear favorite,"" writes Nate Silver at the New York Times. Obama is now leading by four percentage points in Gallup's national tracking poll, two in Rasmussen's, four in Ipsos', and three in RAND's polling. Campaign officials say they don't expect many big changes over the next couple of weeks, as attention turns to Oct. 3 and the first presidential debate.","– President Obama's big win at the DNC may have been a surprise to some, but top advisers to Mitt Romney privately concede that the president now has a much clearer path to victory, Politico reports.

The Romney campaign, armed with more dismal jobs numbers, will run a one-size-fits-all campaign, wrapped around the message that the economy is bad, Obama is to blame, and that change of leadership is absolutely essential."" The Republican plan rests heavily on Romney's capacity to bury Obama with negative ads—and reap the benefits of his billionaire backers hitting the president even harder, and more relentlessly. This, more than anything else, alarms the high command in Chicago. Another big worry for the Obama campaign is that when you dig into the small slice of undecided voters (probably only 6% to 8% of the electorate, according to the campaigns), the demographics are not favorable to Obama: mostly white, many with some college education, economically stressed, largely middle-aged. ""Many of them voted for Obama in 2008 and felt good about that vote, and still think Obama,"" a Democratic official says."
4744,"– The Senate Finance Committee is out with a report slamming drugmaker Gilead for jacking up the price of a Hepatitis C drug by 5,000%. Sovaldi, which is currently the only FDA-approved treatment for Hepatitis C, costs $94,000 a year for a full course. The report, which reviewed more than 20,000 pages of company documents, says the price was ""always Gilead's plan to max out revenue, and that accessibility and affordability were pretty much an afterthought,"" the Washington Post reports. Sen. Charles Grassley and Sen. Ron Wyden led the investigation and released the report Tuesday. They accuse Gilead of ""arbitrary, capricious, and possibly illegal price increases."" The report says Sovaldi's price was raised partly because Gilead expected to set a benchmark for the next generation of hepatitis C drugs, and because insurers and Medicaid programs started restricting access to Sovaldi and its competitors as demand for the treatment increased. ""This might be an example that received the most attention in some time, but it won't be the last,"" Wyden said in a statement, per Business Insider. Gilead responded to the report with a statement saying its prices are ""in line with previous standards of care.""","– In 2014, Gilead Sciences settled on a price of $84,000 for a 12-week course of Sovaldi, a Hepatitis C treatment it had just won federal approval for. The Senate Finance Committee investigation report out Tuesday reveals that the company knew the price would rile up the public, but it went through with the plan anyway. ""Let's not fold to advocacy pressure in 2014,"" Gilead's executive vice president for commercial operations wrote in an internal email, per the Washington Post. What the report found, per internal documents: That price seemed to deliver the right balance: value to shareholders while also not so high that insurers would ""hinder patient access to uncomfortable levels."" But they also got more than they bargained for: an outpouring of outrage from government and private payers, and political scrutiny. ""The documents show it was always Gilead’s plan to max out revenue, and that accessibility and affordability were pretty much an afterthought,"" says Sen.

468,"– Pole vaulting is a dangerous sport, and it's time to do something about it, according to a study published in the Journal of the American College of Sports Medicine. Researchers looked at 32 pole-vaulting injuries that were reported to the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research between 1982 and 1998. They found that 17 of the injuries occurred when an athlete landed with his or her body on the landing pad and their head on the hard ground; eight were caused by being stranded at the height of the jump, and five were caused when the vault box was completely missed. The most common injury was to the low back, which was responsible for 16% of injuries and was followed by the hamstrings and lower leg (13.9% each), the New York Times reports. The researchers concluded that the minimum landing pad size should be increased to 20 feet, and that the rule requiring soft surfaces next to the landing pads should be enforced.","– Pole vaulting is a dangerous sport, and it's time to do something about it, according to a study published in the Journal of the American College of Sports Medicine.

 Pole vaulting is a unique sport in that athletes often land from heights ranging from 10 to 20 feet. We retrospectively reviewed 32 catastrophic pole-vault injuries that were reported to the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research between 1982 and 1998. The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanisms of injury so that preventive strategies c...","– If the words ""pole vaulting"" don't inspire fear in you, they should. That's the upshot of a Vice article about the sport, which succinctly expresses why: ""At 20 feet, a pole vault accident is like someone falling off the roof of their house, while running as fast at they can with a thick pole in their hands."" If that sounds like a brush with death, it quite literally can be: A 2001 study analyzed the 32 catastrophic pole-vault injuries that were reported to the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research between 1982 and 1998; half the accidents resulted in death, and 6 in permanent disabilities. A follow-up study published in 2012 noted that one safety-related change made in 2003 was an expansion of the landing pad's minimum dimensions. In the 8 years that followed, the study noted only two of the 19 catastrophic injuries were fatal. But the rest weren't pretty: major head injuries and spine or pelvic fractures were among them. And a study of collegiate pole vaulters published this last January found 41% sustained some kind of injury, a figure that researchers saw as suggestive of the fact that ""injuries are very common in experienced vaulters."" The injury stats aren't good, and the potential pay and fame aren't much better. So why the heck do it? Vice talked to US record-holder Brad Walker (one of 18 men to ever clear 6 meters), who sums up vaulters as ""risk-takers, usually with something to prove to themselves ... you won't find a vaulter jumping high who doesn't have at least one screw loose."" As for why they stay with it, Vice points to its highly technical and challenging nature: As you approach the box you're a sprinter; then you're a gymnast. Walker says you need ""significant body control and spatial awareness,"" too.","– Pole vaulting is one of the most dangerous events in college track and field, according to a study published yesterday in JAMA Internal Medicine. The study looked at 135 vaulters from 15 universities over a single track-and-field season and found that 41% suffered an injury during their event. The most common injury was to the low back, with the hamstrings and lower leg coming in second and third, respectively, per a press release. Back injuries were the most common type of injury, with 60% of them occurring during the vaulting phase. The risk of injury was 2.7 times higher for vaulters with multiple injuries, and the risk was even higher for those who landed on their body on the landing pad and their head on the ground instead of in the vault box. Researchers recommend that the minimum landing pad size be increased to 16 inches, and that the rule requiring soft surfaces next to the landing pads be enforced. For more, click here."

Walruses use ice as a sort of conveyor belt over new ocean bottom, but sea ice has melted to the point where it's too deep for the mammals to stay on the edge. If a herd is startled by a polar bear, the animals rush to the safety of the ocean, often crushing smaller walruses.

The reason: melting sea ice. Thanks to climate change, sea ice has been disappearing north through the Bering Strait into the Chukchi Sea at a faster rate than it has in decades, the Anchorage Daily News reports. Walruses use sea ice as a sort of conveyor belt over new ocean bottom, but the ice is too deep for them to stay on the edge. Instead, they've come to shore, crowded shoulder-to-shoulder in large numbers, where they face the threat of a stampede if they're startled by a polar bear, hunter, airplane, or boat. The village of Point Lay and the US Fish and Wildlife Service have teamed up to try to keep people away.

Several hundred Pacific walruses began amassing on an island off Alaska’s northwest coast in the first week of August in what wildlife officials say is the earliest date yet for their annual ""haulout."" The culprit appears to be shrinking Arctic ice. Walruses tend to head ashore two weeks after warm temperatures cause sea ice to recede too far north for them in the Chukchi Sea. This year, it happened earlier than ever. Walruses typically use sea ice for protection and as a home base, particularly for juveniles, while adults dive to the ocean floor for food. But ""when that ice retreats to the deeper water, they can't do that,"" Fish and Wildlife rep Andrea Medeiros tells Alaska Public Media. For the past several years, a barrier island near Point Lay has served as an alternative home base. Last year, thousands of walruses had arrived there by Oct. 7. This year, however, the haulout was observed beginning on Aug. 3—a full two weeks ahead of the next earliest date observed back in 2011, reports Alaska Dispatch News. Medeiros tells the AP that last week some 2,000 walruses were observed on the island, where they're expected to stay until the fall. Hoping to head north to observe the animals? Officials would rather you not. Not only is it illegal to disturb them, the walruses are known to stampede to the water in response to plane and boat activity in the area, which spells bad news for juvenile walruses.","– Hundreds of Pacific walruses have arrived on a barrier island near the village of Point Lay in Alaska's Chukchi Sea in what may be the earliest such haul out since the walrus first started showing up in 2007.

""When that ice retreats to the deeper water, they can't do that,"" she says. ""They need a place to rest after they've fed, so they will travel to the shore and haul out there to rest inbetween feeding periods."" This year, she says, sea ice has retreated to the deep water beyond the continental shelf earlier than in the past.

465,"– On March 26, 1830, Joseph Smith translated ""almost all of the present Book of Mormon text"" from gold plates into the language of Mormons—and it took him just three months, from April to June of that year, to do so. The Deseret News takes a look back at the 185-year-old milestone, which the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints calls a ""series of miraculous events."" A topic page on the LDS Church's website states that Smith was asked to ""render into his own language an entire volume of scripture amounting to more than 500 printed pages."" So ""God prepared."" The Mormon Tabernacle Choir's performance in Salt Lake City last week drew thousands of people to the Utah city's Temple Square. But there was one person who wasn't there: Joseph Smith, the man credited with translating the book into English. He was in his early 20s at the time and had ""very little formal education"" and was ""incapable of writing a book on his own, let alone translating an ancient book written from an unknown language,"" according to the church website. He dictated the book's translation to scribes and didn't call for punctuation. Instead, he tasked them with setting the type. The seer stone, believed to be the same one Smith used to translate the book from Hebrew to Mormon English, was found in a remote part of Box Elder County, just south of Salt Lake city. The church says it has always possessed the seer, which was transported across the country during Smith's lifetime, and has been kept in a weathered leather pouch made by one of his wife, Emma Smith, who was one of the only the only one the only a major, the only two, who had a major (both both, and both, which could go, which, which had a feat to which which which could prove to which only to which the feat, which which ended to which could end, to which just which which the only only which which only which could get to which, to get to go to the only to the chance to end to the could go to go (the chance to change to both to have both to the two.","– The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is offering a free copy of the Book of Mormon to anyone who can prove they've received a letter from Joseph Smith, the founder of the church, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. According to the church's website, the letter was written in 1830, three years after the first edition of the book was printed, and was addressed to Smith, a missionary who was in charge of translating the book. In the letter, Smith asks his followers to keep the book as-is, but he also asks them to keep an eye on what they're reading. Hebraisms were common in the early Mormons, a Brigham Young University professor has discovered, but they weren't until the second half of the 20th century. For example, when translating 1 Nephi 13:29, the typesetter used ""&"" instead of ""an,"" and Smith should, not ""an."" Now, for the first time, a study in the history of the Mormon church suggests that Smith translated the book in such a way that he was able to read it in English, the Deseret News reports. The study, by scholars at the University of Utah and the Church of Mormon, builds on previous research. A seer stone believed to have been found by Smith while digging for wells in Vermont in 1822 was recently discovered in a box belonging to Smith's great-great-granddaughter. The 20-inch-wide, 5-inch-high stone is engraved with the words ""Urim and Thummim,"" which means ""two transparent stones in the form of spectacles.","SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The Mormon church took another step toward transparency Tuesday with the first published pictures of a small sacred stone it believes founder Joseph Smith used to help translate a story that became the basis of the religion.

 The Church of Jesus...","– To most people, it just looks like a smooth, egg-sized rock, but it was part of the founding of the Mormon church and photos of it have now been published for the first time. The images of the ""seer stone"" that Mormons believe founder Joseph Smith used to translate buried gold plates he said he found in upstate New York 185 years ago were released as part of what the church says is an effort to be more transparent about its past, the AP reports. The photos have been published in a book that also includes pictures of the ""printer's manuscript"" of the Book of Mormon—a handwritten copy of the original manuscript that was produced by one of Smith's scribes. The book, which Smith said he translated from ""reformed Egyptian"" with the stone, recounts a visit from Jesus Christ to North America, reports the Salt Lake Tribune. As for the translation, the church has this to say: ""Joseph placed ... the seer stone in a hat, pressed his face into the hat to block out extraneous light, and read aloud the English words that appeared on the instrument."" It says the translation occurred over three months in 1829 as part of a ""a series of miraculous events."" Indeed: In March, the Deseret News reported that the church says it takes roughly five years to translate and then produce the Book of Mormon in another language. The church says it is trying to make its history more ""tangible"" with the release, but Terryl Givens, professor of literature and religion at the University of Richmond, tells the AP that the church is also trying to show skeptics it has nothing to hide. ""Other churches' origins are concealed by the mist of history. Mormonism is the first world religion in which the origins were exposed to public view, to documentation, to journalists, and newspaper reporting."" (Last year, the church admitted that Smith had up to 40 wives.)","– It's been more than 200 years since Joseph Smith found a seer stone in a well in Ohio that he used to dig for gold. Now, researchers say they've found another that might shed light on how he translated the Book of Mormon. In a paper published in the American Journal of History, the researchers say Smith's translation of the book was based on two seer stones, or spectacles, found in a Shaker village in Ohio in 1831. They believe Smith placed the stones in a hat and ""looked into it."" The Shaker, Richard McNemar, was a devout Mormon who lived in the late 19th century. In 1831, McNemar spoke of seeing ""two transparent stones in the form of spectacles"" through which he ""looked on the engraving & afterwards put his face into a hat & the interpretation then flowed into his mind,"" according to a Deseret Evening News article from the time. The researchers say the spectacles were based on McNemar's description of seeing two ""transparent stones"" in the well, and they believe Smith used them to typeset the book in modern English. In the book's Latin section, for instance, the words ""an,"" ""reed,"" and ""thou"" are used in Latin, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. But a researcher says he's found handwriting that suggests Joseph actually dictated the text in another language."

Maine is one of 19 states that hasn't approved Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, and LePage has vetoed five attempts to do so. If the expansion is approved in Maine, an estimated 70,000 low-income people would gain access to health care.

The federal government says it's ready to pony up the $525 million the state would get per year if it did so, and the director of Maine Equal Justice Partners, the group behind the expansion, says LePage's not interested. ""Hospitals are only concerned with their pocketbooks, and they don't care about the hardships it will cause.""","After President Trump and Republicans in Congress spent much of the year trying to repeal the health law and cut spending on Medicaid, a half-century-old entitlement program that covers one in five Americans, the pro-expansion side in Maine is hoping to benefit from energized public support for it.

Maine is one of 19 states where Republicans have blocked Medicaid expansion available under the ACA. The Maine legislature has voted repeatedly to expand Medicaid only to have Gov. Paul LePage veto expansion five times. However, if expansion is approved by voters through a referendum next month, LePage would be unable to veto it. If the referendum passes, approximately 80,000 more Maine residents making up to 138% of the poverty level will be eligible for Medicaid. In addition to decreasing the number of uninsured Maine residents, supporters of the referendum say it will add jobs and help rural hospitals stay open. LePage, while attacking Maine hospitals for their support of the referendum on Friday, said it would take ""resources away from our most vulnerable Mainers"" to ""give free taxpayer-funded healthcare to adults who should be working and contributing,"" the Press Herald reports. Under the ACA, at least 90% of Medicaid expansion costs would be covered by the federal government. The other 18 states where Medicaid expansion has been blocked are carefully watching what happens in Maine. It's estimated more than 2.5 million Americans would gain access to health care if all 19 holdout states allowed Medicaid expansion.","– Maine residents ""will have to pay to give 'free' healthcare to adults who should be working,"" says Gov. Paul LePage, and if hospitals ""have their way, that somebody would be Maine taxpayers."" The Republican governor, who has repeatedly vetoed attempts to expand Medicaid in the state, is still opposed to the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion, which would add 80,000 low-income residents to the program, the Portland Press Herald reports. The federal government is paying 90% or more of the cost for the expansion population. Maine is one of 19 states that hasn't approved Medicaid expansion. The expansion would cover those making up to 138% of the federal poverty level, or about $40,000 a year for a family of four. A recent poll found 47% of Maine voters support the expansion, the biggest change to Medicaid since the program began 50 years ago. Supporters of the expansion say it would drive down the state's uninsured rate, improve health, and access to preventive care, create 4,000 jobs, and improve access to health care. ""Hospitals are only concerned with their pocketbooks, and they don't care about the hardships it will cause for taxpayers, the elderly, and the disabled,"" says a spokeswoman for the Maine Hospital Association. ""We believe the answer is Medicaid expansion."" LePage has reduced Medicaid eligibility since taking office in 2011, cutting off coverage for childless adults and tightening eligibility for parents."

""With the massive social changes going on today, his words are poignant now more than ever."" The book is ""an injection of weirdness, joy, and provocation right into your brain,"" the review continues. ""Ultimately, Make Trouble leaves me wondering what to expect next from Waters. He is the modern day Oscar Wilde, but this book is by no means his De Profundis.

 The Wisconsin governor entered the primary in July as a front-runner in Iowa and a darling of both the conservative base and powerful donors after winning battles against public unions in his left-leaning home state.

Where did it all go wrong for the Wisconsin governor? Insiders tell Politico that Walker was overconfident, and though he tried to act as his own campaign manager, he seemed to be ""making it up as he went along,"" causing plenty of strategic blunders. Fundraising dried up as Donald Trump's rise pushed him to the sidelines, leaving him with a large organization but little support. His sudden departure from the race came after he failed to make an impression at the second debate and a CNN poll found his support at well below 1%. ""He was a terrible candidate, but he also got Trump-ed,"" a source tells Politico. More: Sources tell CNN that although a super PAC supporting him had plenty of cash, Walker's campaign funds started to dry up after the first debate as donors looked elsewhere. Walker ""is a pragmatist above all else and just didn't see the path to a comeback"" after his poll numbers collapsed even in Iowa, a campaign insider says. Walker was hurt by flip-flops on issues like birthright citizenship, where he changed his position three times in a week, CNN notes, and by gaffes like suggesting he would consider building a wall along the Canadian border. In his exit speech last night, Walker said he had been ""called to lead by helping to clear the field in this race so that a positive conservative message can rise to the top of the field."" He urged other candidates to follow his lead so a clear alternative to Trump could emerge, the Washington Post reports. Some of Walker's former rivals praised him as he left the race, including Marco Rubio, who called him ""one of the best governors in the country,"" and Donald Trump, who said ""he's a very nice person and has a great future,"" reports the Hill. The rival campaigns didn't wait until Walker announced his exit to start trying to poach his aides and his donors, the AP reports. The competition heated up after the announcement: A source close to the billionaire Ricketts family, which had supported Walker, tells the AP that within minutes of the governor's press conference, the family received calls from six campaigns, some of them from the candidates themselves. (Rick Perry has also dropped out of the race, and one donor wants his $5 million back.)","– Scott Walker will join Rick Perry in dropping out of the GOP race for president, reports the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

1955,"– A team of neuroscientists says it has successfully restored bladder control in rats using a technique that could someday help the millions of people with spinal cord injuries. The team, which worked with neuroscientists at Case Western Reserve and Cleveland Clinic, grafted nerves onto the rats' spinal cords and allowed them to regain bladder control six months after the injury, reports the BBC. ""While urinary control is complex and recovery took several months, it was clear that this primitive function lost to spinal cord injury does possess the capacity to rewire itself, even when a relatively small number of axons are regenerated,"" one of the researchers says in a press release. ""We were especially surprised and excited to discover that once a permissive environment was created, a subset of neurons situated largely within the brainstem, which play important roles in bladder function, slowly re-grew lengthy axon far down the cord."" The team plans to trial the technique on larger animals before moving on to human trials. Meanwhile, scientists have taken a big step forward in the fight against ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease, with the successful testing of a new treatment on rats. It could be ""within three to five years"" before the disease is completely wiped out, the lead researcher says, though he notes that the rats did not regain the ability to walk.","– For the first time, paralyzed rats have been able to squeeze out urine—and that's a ""very big deal,"" a neurologist tells Science. If the treatment works in humans, he says, ""it would change their lives."" In the study, researchers snipped out a healthy nerve bundle from between rats' ribs, graft it onto a damaged section of spinal cord, and add an enzyme that chews up scar tissue. After six months, the rats could mostly control their bladders and were able to wiggle their legs. ""Although animals did not regain the ability to walk, they did recover a remarkable measure of urinary control,"" says the lead author of the study in the Journal of Neuroscience.

3242,"– There's no such thing as a perfect hand, but scientists say they've figured out how to make people's hands warmer when they're steaming hot. Reporting in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, they say that by measuring the temperature of subjects' hands as they watched a video, they were able to tell whether the hand was warmer or colder when the water was hot or cold. ""This is the first time we've been able to show that the hand temperature responses are independent of the body temperature,"" the lead researcher says in a University of London press release. The study involved 15 healthy volunteers who were shown either warm or cold videos of their hands while simultaneously recording their own hand temperatures. The volunteers were then asked to touch the videos with their hands, and researchers found that they could actually see ice cubes in the cool videos and steam in the warm ones, Live Science reports. ""We think that this is probably because the warm videos were less potent—the only cues that the water is warm was steam at the beginning of the videos and ... looking at someone's shivering hand can make you feel colder than if you were sitting in warm water,"" a researcher says, per Ars Technica. ""People seem to be capable of mimicking—feel like your skin is getting a little warm?""","– If you're like most of us, you may find it hard to wrap your head around the fact that a stranger's hand is warmer than yours. But a new study out of University College London suggests that's not necessarily a bad thing. Reporting in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers say that subjects who watched videos of two actors holding water with either their left or right hand were more likely to be moved by the temperature of the water when the hand of the actor was warmer than that of the person holding it. ""This is the first time that such an effect has been shown on a large scale,"" the lead researcher says in a press release. The study involved measuring the thermistors in the palm of participants' hands, which allowed the researchers to determine the difference in temperature between the hands of actors playing hot and cold games, Scientific American reports. The researchers found that people's heart rates, skin temperature, and cortisol levels increase when they're feeling empathy for others. ""All home animals, including humans rigidly regulate their core body temperature through a variety of involuntary thermoregulatory responses, such as shivering and non-shivering thermogenesis, cutaneous vasomotor responses, sweating, piloerection,"" the researcher says. In another study published in Scientific Reports, researchers asked subjects to touch the skin of strangers while sitting in a room with a slightly warmer or colder temperature. The subjects' hands became less cold when they saw strangers' hands become less cold. The hypothalamus—the part of the body that regulates body temperature—received heat signals and directed the hands back to where people used to be when they were once cold. ""If you wished your hand was cold,"" the study says the study, according to a study. (Another study suggests that empathy may help people could help people may be used for people with people who could be used to help people, if if if ""if if if a possible if if the kind of which which, which which could be if if If if if to get if if either if if admit that that that if the fact, if the results if if that if if ... if if you can admit that they can get the fact.",,,

5287,"– When fantasy novelist Zhang Wei paid $10,000 for a bottle of Scotch whisky at a bar in Switzerland last month, he thought it was the world's most expensive bottle of whisky. But when he opened it, he found something far more mundane: It was probably a fake, reports the Independent. The .67-ounce bottle of Macallan single malt whisky was purchased by the Chinese man at the Devil's Place Whiskey Bar in St. Moritz. Owner Sandro Bernasconi says he was ""petrified"" when he first opened the bottle, thinking the cork would fall apart or the whisky would taste bad, but the customer was happy with the taste, per the Local. He says he will refund Zhang's money if tests confirm the bottle is a fake. It's not the first time a fake Macallan has turned up. In 2002, Macallan itself bought 100 bottles that turned out to be fake, notes Wine Searcher, which calls them ""very convincing fakes."" The fakes are ""almost worthless as a collector's item,"" a collector tells the BBC. ""What's dodgy with these bottles is that apparently, Kemp never owned Macallan and Taliker Alliance from 1878, and that nobody ever found traces of the Macallans from 1878.""","– It was supposed to be one of the rarest bottles of whisky in the world. Instead, it turns out it's ""almost worthless as a collector's item,"" according to a press release from Rare Whisky 101. Beijing multimillionaire Zhang Wei paid $9,998 for the Macallan 1878 in Switzerland in July, claiming it was the last unopened bottle of a batch that dates back to 1878. ""When Mr. Zhang asked if he could try some, we told him it wasn't for sale,"" says the hotel's manager. ""My father bought the bottle of Macallan 25 years ago, when he was manager of this hotel, and it had not been opened. When he said he really wanted to try it, I called my father who told me we could wait another 20 years for a customer like that so we should sell it. Zhang and I then opened the bottle together and drank some of it."" But carbon dating tests conducted by University of Oxford and alcohol analysts Tatlock and Thomson found it was probably a blended Scotch, with 60% malt and 40% grain, and dates back no further than 1970.

Eyebrows were raised about the veracity of Zhang Wei's purchase after photos were posted online of Zhang posing with the bottle and the manager of the Waldhaus Am See hotel; the Swiss hotel's Devil's Place whisky bar has a 2,500-bottle collection. The prime condition of the vintage bottle, and the wording on the label didn't add up, said doubters. They were right. The BBC reports a series of lab tests were performed and returned all-around negative results. University of Oxford researchers carbon dated the sample and say there's a 95% probability it was produced between 1970 and 1972. And it's not even a single malt, as testing by alcohol analysts Tatlock and Thomson found it was a blend of 60% malt and 40% grain. Manager Sandro Bernasconi tells the Scotsman, ""The result has been a big shock to the system, and we are delighted to have repaid our customer in full as a gesture of goodwill."" The repayment was done in what's likely the most expensive way possible: SwissInfo.ch reports Bernasconi flew to Beijing to apologize and reimburse Zhang. The Daily Meal suspects the bottle is one of a batch of fakes that were so convincing Macallan actually purchased 100 such bottles in 2002. As for the story behind the man who felt comfortable paying so much for a nip of Scotch, he's a 36-year-old writer of online fantasy novels who reportedly made $16.8 million in 2015.

Greene, who is black, became an advocate for marijuana legalization in Alaska after meeting people who used it medicinally and being forced to buy it on the streets at gunpoint. She eventually founded the Alaska Cannabis Club, which allowed people to buy ""donations"" of marijuana.

A previous investigation by the two news outlets suggested that former District Attorney Mary Lacy erred when she exonerated members of the Ramsey family in 2008 based on her interpretation of earlier DNA tests. Lacy concluded that those tests revealed that an intruder killed the girl, but outside forensic experts have since disputed that, asserting that the DNA was a mishmash of multiple people and not that of the single person referred to as ""Unknown Male 1."" ""If you're looking for someone that doesn't exist, because actually it's several people, it's a problem,"" explained a former US attorney for Colorado. The new, more sophisticated tests could provide an answer to which view is right. They could also reveal the DNA is worthless in terms of tracking down the killer, and merely the result of ""inconsequential contact with other people,"" per the Camera. One of the most high-profile anniversary stories about the case came via CBS, whose expert panel concluded that JonBenet's brother, Burke, killed his sister. Burke has since sued, but the forensic pathologist he's going after argued in court documents this month that his view on the case was mere ""speculation"" about ""one of the major unsolved crimes"" of the 20th century and thus should be protected speech, reports People.

4450,"– South Korea says it won't allow North Korea to attend a reunion for families separated by the Korean War next month despite Pyongyang's demand for the return of 22 restaurant workers who defected to the South earlier this year. South Korea's Unification Ministry said Friday that the reunion will go ahead as planned on Aug. 3, but it will ""not be possible"" for the North to attend if the restaurant defectors aren't returned immediately, Yonhap News reports. According to South Korean media, the 22 women worked at a restaurant in the North Korean border town of Panmunjom and say they were pressured into defecting by superiors at the restaurant who threatened to kill them if they tried to return to the North. The North has demanded the women's return.","– North Korea is ratcheting up its rhetoric against the South ahead of a reunion of families separated by the Korean War next month, Yonhap News reports. According to the North's official Korean Central News Agency, the South ""kidnapped"" two restaurant workers from the North and is trying to force them back across the border. ""We will closely watch what action the South Korean government will take,"" says one North Korean propaganda website. ""It could serve as an obstacle not just to the planned reunions of separated families between the two Koreas but also to the overall inter-Korean relations.""

The leaders of North and South Korea will meet again sometime in September, their third such meeting in five months, reports CNN. This time, however, the South's Moon Jae-in will travel to Pyongyang to meet with Kim Jong Un. High-level officials from the two nations announced the meeting after talks in the Demilitarized Zone on Monday. No agenda has been released, but the two sides have been discussing everything from a possible peace declaration to economic projects, notes Reuters. One potential sore spot: The plight of 12 North Korean women now in South Korea as restaurant workers. The North claims they were kidnapped—or perhaps tricked into defecting—and must be returned, while the South maintains they defected of their own accord in 2016 through China, per Yonhap News. ""If our female citizens' repatriation issue is not resolved as quickly as possible, it could serve as an obstacle not just to the planned reunions of separated families between the two Koreas but also to the overall inter-Korean relations,"" said Uriminzokkiri, a propaganda website for the North, last month. South Korean officials declined to say if the issue came up in Monday's talks.","– The leaders of North and South Korea will meet in Pyongyang in September for the third time this year, CNN reports.

""What's very important is that both governments do all they ought to do regarding progressing all the issues on the agenda,"" Ri Son Gwon, North Korea's point man for inter-Korean relations, told reporters. ""If the issues that were raised in the inter-Korea talks and individual meetings are not resolved, then unexpected problems could arise and all the items on the Agenda could meet obstacles.""

2478,"– Texas is bracing itself for more flooding after days of heavy rain, with the remnants of Hurricane Patricia expected to soak the state over the next few days. The storm system already moving through Texas dumped nearly two feet of rain on parts of the state since Friday, causing flooding that blocked several major roadways, the AP reports. Galveston County Judge Mark Henry on Saturday issued a voluntary evacuation for Bolivar Peninsula, just northeast of Galveston Island, after forecasters predicted that the area would get 8 to 12 inches of rain and tides that are 4 to 5 feet high. ""Elderly residents and people with medical conditions should make plans to leave the area before dark,"" Henry said. County spokeswoman Brittany Rainville said there were buses waiting to evacuate people, but no one had yet shown up to leave. She said about 4,000 people live on the peninsula. In San Antonio, a man walking his dog before dawn early Saturday was swept into a flooded drainage ditch and disappeared, fire officials said.

Navarro County, where the train was derailed around 3:30am local time, had received nearly 2 feet of rain in 24 hours, and more was expected with what's left of Hurricane Patricia heading into the area. According to the AP, a creek overflowed and washed away the train tracks. ""[The crew] escaped the train after it stopped and swam to high ground,"" a Union Pacific spokesperson tells the AP. ""A Navarro County rescue team was able to get in and pull them to safety. They are back safe on dry ground.""

The train—which is carrying cement or gravel—was still on its side hours later, with crews waiting until water levels drop before they attempt to remove it. After three days of heavy rains, Navarro County has carried out five dozen water rescues. According to the AP, only one person is missing so far in the recent Texas flooding. A man walking his dog in San Antonio fell into a flooded draining ditch and was swept away. His dog was later found safe.","– Hurricane Patricia has been downgraded to a tropical depression, but Texas isn't out of the woods yet.

The 64-car train was traveling from Midlothian to Houston when it got caught in floodwaters that had closed major highways throughout North Texas. The county has received 20 to 21 inches of rainfall in the past 24 hours, and emergency management coordinator Eric Myers tells NBC that 72 swift-water rescues have been performed. The heaviest of the rain should be done by Saturday night, he adds, ""but they're going to have flooding problems in South and East Texas at least through tomorrow."" Hundreds of flights were canceled or delayed on Thursday and Friday at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. The airport got 3.24 inches of rain on Friday alone—a daily record.

But on other issues, like abortion and her belief that unemployment benefits deter the jobless from applying for work, she stridently defended herself amid criticism from her Democratic rival, Talking Points Memo reports. In an interview on Face to Face With Jon Ralston, Angle held firm in opposing extension of unemployment benefits. Instead, she said jobs exist that those on benefits should be taking. ""They keep extending unemployment benefits to the point where people are afraid to go out and get a job because the job doesn't pay as much as the benefit,"" Angle said. ""There are jobs that do exist."" Angle also reaffirmed her opposition to abortion, saying government should not have gotten involved in the issue. When Ralston challenged her comments to a conservative talk show host that abortion should not be available even in the case of rape or incest, Angle said she values life.

 WHERE SHE DIDN'T Angle held firm in opposing extension of unemployment benefits. She also restated her opposition to abort...","– A little thing like rape isn't a good enough excuse for an abortion, as far as Sharron Angle's concerned. Harry Reid's conservative, Tea Party-backed opponent gave an interview in January, in which she told conservative host Bill Manders that rape victims need to trust in God's plan. “Is there any reason at all for an abortion?” Manders asks in the clip, which was dug up by Think Progress. “Not in my book,” Angle replies. Not even, Manders presses, in the case of rape or incest? “Well, you know, I'm a Christian,” Angle says, “and I believe that God has a plan and a purpose for each one of our lives and that he can intercede in all kinds of situations and we need to have a little faith.” Angle got pressed on the issue yesterday in her first interview with the mainstream press since winning the GOP nomination. (More details from it at the Las Vegas Sun.) “You want government to go and tell a 13-year-old child who’s been raped by her father she has to have that baby?” asked her interviewer. “I didn’t say that,"" she responded. ""I always say that I value life.”","– Tea Party favorite Sharron Angle says she values life even in cases of rape or incest. “You want government to go and tell a 13-year-old child who’s been raped by her father she has to have that baby?” a conservative radio host asked. “I didn’t say that,” Angle replied. She added that she believes government should stay out of the issue of abortion, but “the government decided to get involved in this, not me. I’m just defending my position.” Angle has been making the rounds on conservative talk shows, but has so far avoided the mainstream media, Talking Points Memo reports. “It’s shocking to hear her say that the separation of church and state isn’t part of the Constitution, when it is laid out in the First Amendment,” said a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee."

Trump's plan to build a border wall and make Mexico pay for it appears to be the most controversial part of the list, but it also includes immigrants who came to the US illegally as children and people who have relatives here.

""But unfortunately, the tradition of nontradition marches on."" So Bergesen's company has decided to get involved.

""Because as it turns out, if we want someone to be a household name, we might have to build the houses."" In a press release, Bergesen points out that the women's equivalent of the four-minute mile isn't even close. Only 71 American women have run it.","– When it comes to marathon running, women are way ahead of their male counterparts, according to new research out of the University of British Columbia. ""There's no battle at all,"" assistant professor Brian Dalton says. ""Maybe more of a balance of the sexes."" In the study published in Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism, Dalton recruited eight men and nine women at a similar level of physical fitness and had them flex their feet against a set of sensors as quickly as they could 200 times. ""We chose to measure foot movements because it makes use of calf muscles on the back of the leg, which are essential for practical, everyday tasks like standing and walking,"" Dalton says in a press release. ""What we found is that males were faster and more powerful at first but became more fatigued much faster than females."" Dalton says his results are consistent with previous research that shows males complete events like ultra-trail running faster but females are considerably less tired by the end. ""If ever an ultra-ultra-marathon is developed, women may well dominate in that arena,"" he says. In a New York Times op-ed, the founder of apparel company Oiselle argues that women should be able to run the equivalent of a sub-two-hour marathon. Only 71 American women have ever run the sub-4:30 mile, and Bergesen wants to change that.","In the battle of the sexes, new UBC research suggests that men may be stronger physically but women have much greater muscle endurance than their male counterparts.

""We've known for some time that women are less fatigable than men during isometric muscle tests—static exercises where joints don't move, such as holding a weight—but we wanted to find out if that's true during more dynamic and practical everyday movements,"" says UBC researcher Brian Dalton in a press release. ""And the answer is pretty definitive: women can outlast men by a wide margin."" Collaborating with the University of Guelph and University of Oregon, the researchers report in the journal Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism that a handful of men and women were asked to flex their foot against sensors as fast as they could 200 times. Those sensors captured several metrics, including speed, power, torque, and even electrical activity in their muscles. The men were both faster and more powerful, but they also became more fatigued ""much faster"" than the women. Dalton notes that in ultra-trail running, men tend to be faster, but women tend to be far less tired; in fact in Outside, one runner calls for separate goals for women. ""If ever an ultra-ultra-marathon is developed, women may likely dominate,"" Dalton says. But as for the Mars-vs.-Venus battle, Dalton jokes, ""there's no battle at all. Maybe more of a balance of the sexes."" More seriously: ""Both sexes have valuable physical abilities and it only makes sense that we study and develop the tools to afford them the best advantage."" (Sex gets better with age for women.)","– When Kenya's Eliud Kipchoge ran the men's four-minute mile at last year's Boston Marathon, he became the first man to run it in under 4 minutes. But where was the women's equivalent? ""Was it never even considered because, like the Four-minute Mile, we lack a goal with numeric roundness?"" asks Sally Bergesen, CEO of apparel company Oiselle, in a New York Times op-ed. ""Or was it because the company—and the industry itself—lacks the necessary interest and creativity to define what the equivalent mark would be for women?"" The answer is yes, and it's an important one. Only 71 American women have ever run the four- minute mile, while almost 500 American men have. ""We will shout it from the rooftops, drop it into casual conversations, and speak of the women who break it with reverence,"" Bergesen writes.

The protests are the biggest in years, the Times reports, and they have raised fears of a confrontation between Morsi’s supporters, who support him, and the millions of Egyptians who turned out for last year's ouster of Hosni Mubarak. Morsi has moved his presidential palace to a safer part of Cairo, though some top members of the Brotherhood spent the day in Itahadiya, fearing for their safety.","– A year after Mohamed Morsi was sworn in as Egypt's first democratically elected president, hundreds of thousands of protesters are again taking to the streets in what opponents are calling a ""million-man march,"" the AP reports. The demonstrations come after Morsi told the Guardian that he would not resign, and hours after his office announced that eight members of the country's interim parliament had resigned over Morsi's latest speech, in which he insulted judges. Army troops have been deployed in some of Cairo's suburbs, and helicopters flew over the city on several occasions on Sunday. ""The scenes of protests are unprecedented in size and scope, and seemingly surpass those during the 18-day uprising that toppled Mubarak,"" says the New York Times, which notes that it's not clear whether the military will make good on its threat to use force.",,,
5196,"– Saddam Hussein's former defense minister has been sentenced to life in prison for his role in the 2003 US invasion that toppled the dictator. Qusay al-Sadr, 52, was found guilty of torture and other charges and will serve a life sentence with the possibility of parole. Prosecutors say he tortured detainees at the infamous Abu Ghraib prison. Sadr's lawyers say he was blindfolded, beaten, forced to drink his own urine, and subjected to electric shocks to his genitals. He was also tortured for refusing to admit to being a member of Saddam's Ba'ath party, according to the Telegraph, which has a video interview with Sadr. In other Saddam news: ""People are scared to hire me,"" says Saddam Hussain, a 24-year-old who says his name—given to him by his grandfather 25 years ago—is the reason he's been unable to find work as a marine engineer two years after graduating from India's Noorul Islam University, the BBC reports. ""I am an innocent victim of somebody else's crimes,"" he says. Hussain says his job applications have been rejected some 40 times by shipping companies, and he can't provide proof of a new passport, driving license, or voter ID under his new name, Sajid. His university has refused to change the name until he gets his Class 10 and 12 exam certificates changed first. He moved to a court last week to force it to do so, but the judge set a May 5 for a hearing.","– When Sajid al-Hussein graduated from high school in Iraq last year, he didn't have to worry about getting his driver's license back—because he had a new name. The 23-year-old says he was given the name Saddam Hussein by his father, who was a member of the former dictator's Ba'ath party and had named his son after him, the BBC reports. But a court ruled that the name must remain on his documents, and another hearing is set for May 5, at which a judge will decide whether to force the government to change the name. ""My father named me after him and I don't want him to change my name,"" he says. ""I want my name to be like my father's."" Saddam's plight is nothing new in Iraq, where people have named their children after various dictators, including Saddam Hussein. One man says his father was fired from his government job because he couldn't convince his superiors he wasn't a party member. Others say they were captured by a Shia militia, set down on their knees, and had the barrel of a gun placed against the back of their head. Somehow, thanks to sheer luck, the weapon jammed.","His grandfather had lovingly given him his name, hoping that one day he would grow up into a ‘positive’ human being. Some 25 years later, the marine engineer from Jamshedpur in Jharkhand is despondent on being forced to bear the burden of his name. 
 
 Two years after passing out as a marine engineer from Tamil Nadu’s Noorul Islam University, Saddam Hussain says he has failed to find a job because of his namesake: the former Iraqi ruler executed in 2006. Saddam Hussein was a dictator blamed for ...","– Saddam Hussain's name is making it difficult for him to get a job. ""People are scared to hire me,"" the 25-year-old Indian marine engineer tells the Hindustan Times. Hussain was, yes, named for that Saddam Hussein; the name was given to him by his grandfather. It turned out to be a poor choice, as the young man has been unable to find a job since graduating university two years ago, despite having done very well in school. And he's applied for dozens of positions. He says he's spoken with some of the HR departments of companies he's applied with, and they told him his name was the problem, because it could cause ""suspicion."" One recruitment expert points out that this would be a problem especially if a job requires travel abroad, during which he might get stopped by airport or border authorities: ""He might just keep getting stuck or the company has to pull him out of the sticky situation, making the hire cumbersome,"" the expert says. Hussain got his first name legally changed to Sajid, but though he got all his official documents changed to reflect his new name, his original name still poses a problem because it's listed on educational certificates, which prospective employers want to see. He's working on getting those certificates changed as well, but the process is moving slowly, the BBC reports. (Meanwhile, in America, a guy is trying to change his name to Hitler.)","– Saddam Hussein may be dead, but his name lives on in one man's life in India. The BBC reports on the plight of Sajid Saddam, a 25-year-old marine engineer who was given the name Hussain by his grandfather, who apparently thought it was a good idea to name his own son after the Iraqi dictator. After graduating from college two years ago, Saddam got a job with a shipping company, but it refused to hire him. ""People are scared to hire me,"" he says. ""I am an innocent victim of somebody else's crimes."" So Saddam went to court to change his name, and a judge gave him the go-ahead to do so on May 5, though it's not clear whether he'll be able to get a new passport, driving license, or school certificate under his new name. ""It is not only us who hate you, the entire country hates you,"" a friend tells the Times of India of Saddam, who says he's known by many names, including Saddam Hussein, during his childhood in Baghdad. (The former dictator was hanged in 2006.)"

79,"– Julia Roberts' half-sister, Nancy Motes, was found dead of an apparent drug overdose yesterday. A coroner's spokesman tells the New York Post that ""a number of prescription medications were discovered in the bathroom area as were illegal drugs. We are still investigating whether they were hers or not. We're not releasing what illegal drugs they were."" Motes was living in a tiny apartment with her fiance, John Dilbeck, and a child. Roberts' mother ""had tried for a long time, for years, to get Nancy to go into rehab, and she repeatedly refused,"" a source tells the Post. ""They did not approve of John and felt that he was a bad influence on her. But you can’t tell someone of Nancy’s age whom not to date. She was live-in with John and his brother and a kid. While Nancy wasn’t a wealthy woman, she would have had gifts given to her by Julia as well as intimate family pictures. It’s extremely difficult for her because it didn’t have to happen.

Of particular concern: gifts Roberts gave her sister and ""intimate family pictures,"" the source explains. ""There is a fear that John could be holding Nancy’s personal items hostage and possibly sell them to the highest bidder. If Nancy had photos and wrote a diary, describing her feelings towards her sister, he could use them,"" the source adds.

""We are talking about people who are powerful,"" he says. ""People who have very delicate power, people who are in the limelight. Their power can be destroyed very easily if unfortunate things make them look more wicked. They have to be careful, it can destroy their career or their Academy Award.""

""You meet someone and it just clicks,"" Esposito told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette last month. So with the SCOTUS decision over the summer to legalize gay marriage, the men looked forward to finally tying the knot. But one issue is holding them back: Esposito is technically Bosee's father, because he adopted him in 2012. ""We thought never in our lifetime—or in 20 lifetimes—...same-sex marriage [would] happen,"" Bosee said, adding to CNN that the adoption ""gave us the most legitimate thing available to us"" at the time. Even though they petitioned to have the adoption annulled, Allegheny County Judge Lawrence O'Toole —known for being progressive on LGBT issues—rejected that plea, noting that adoptions are typically only dissolved when fraud is involved and that nixing theirs ""would place in jeopardy and imperil adoption decrees generally."" Adoptions of this sort are often sought to cement legal status for financial and other reasons, as well as to strengthen emotional ties. The men said it was both: Esposito told the Post-Gazette ""we felt we lacked a family of our own,"" but they also discovered that any money they inherited from each other would be subject to a much greater inheritance tax if they weren't considered relatives. One person on the couple's side: Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey, who tells the Post-Gazette, ""I wasn't aware that LGBT couples were turning to this method. I can't even imagine having to get an adoption petition approved … to visit a loved one in the hospital.""

The estate tax is levied on any assets above $11 million, even if those assets are in the form of real estate, according to the state tax department. The executor is required by law to pay the tax within three months of the death of the person, the paper notes. The man, who was in his 80s, left behind three sons, one of whom is a senior at West Chester Area High School. If the executor doesn't pay the inheritance tax by Sept. 30, the estate will be considered late payment."

""Here in Minnesota, we have 11 proud tribal nations, but only 150 years ago, their ancestors, men and women, elders and children, were hunted and murdered for profit. The pain of this brutal and shameful history is still with us."" More than two dozen speakers from across the country addressed the noisy but peaceful gathering. They consider the Redskins moniker deeply offensive, while team owner Daniel Snyder argues that it honors Native Americans and has vowed never to change it. ""My son doesn't want to be your mascot,"" yelled a 35-year-old Crow Creek Sioux who carried a sign that read ""Wake Up Snyder."" The interactions between protesters and Redskins fans never turned violent, but they were often tense and sometimes profane. In 1992, when the Buffalo Bills played Washington in the only Super Bowl hosting Minnesota, an estimated 3,000 protesters protested outside. Last November, when the Vikings hosted the Redskins in Minneapolis, the university asked the team to don throwback jerseys. The school, which is leasing the stadium to the Vikings, has also asked that the name not be uttered by the public address announcer and that it not appear on the scoreboard or program guide.",,,
1331,"– Men with beards are more likely to be sexist than men with clean-shaven beards, according to a new study. ""It is suggested that sexist men choose to grow facial hair because it maximizes sexual dimorphism and augments perceived masculinity and dominance,"" the lead researcher says in a press release. ""Given the ease with which facial hair can be groomed and removed entirely, why should some men retain beards and others choose to remove them?"" He theorizes that bearded men adopt sexist attitudes because they are rated as more masculine, mature, dominant, and aggressive. ""These social perceptions may lead men with bearded beards to behave according to established masculine norms, and more readily endorse hostile sexist attitudes,"" Dixson says. For more on the study, click here.","– If you have a beard, you're more likely to be sexist than a clean-shaven man, according to a new study. Researchers surveyed more than 300 men from the US and India about their facial hair and found that those with beards were ""significantly higher in hostile sexism"" than men with clean beards, Science Daily reports. ""Facial hair may appeal to hostile sexist males because it maximizes facial masculinity and augments perceived dominance,"" the study says. ""Furthermore, hostile sexist attitudes and nationality were the only significant predictors of whether or not men chose to grow facial hair.""

3377,"– The Bramble Cay melomys, also known as the mosaic-tailed rat, lived only on the small island of Bramble Cay, a coral strip in the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Queensland, Australia. It was discovered in 1845 by Europeans who shot the ""large rats"" for sport, and the last known sighting in 2009 by a professional fisherman, reports the Guardian. But after a 2014 study found no sign of the rodent, researchers decided to conduct the most extensive survey possible in the hope of conserving the species. That survey, using traps, cameras, and searches, ""produced no records of the species, confirming that the only known population of this rodent is now extinct,"" says the report, published in the journal Zootaxa. The key factor behind the extinction was ""almost certainly"" ocean inundation of the low-lying cay, likely on several occasions, over the last decade, which resulted in dramatic habitat loss. Available data on sea-level rise and weather events in the Torres Strait region ""point to human-induced climate change being the root cause of the loss"" and ""probably represents the first documented mammalian extinction due solely (or primarily) to anthropogenic climate change."" Melomys rubicola, which can grow up to a foot in length, were first discovered on Bramble Cay in the 1970s and are believed to have survived until at least the 1980s, when they were hunted to the point of extinction. They were also known to eat green turtles, terns, and delta boobies, but were thought to be inbred because they ate only the plant Portulaca oleracea.

They were also vulnerable to disease, were hunted by indigenous people who visited the island from Papua New Guinea on a regular basis, and were likely killed by domestic dogs released onto the island by those same indigenous people. Researchers believe the animals were driven to extinction by climate change and rising sea levels, which made it harder for them to find vegetation to eat and made areas where they could hide more difficult to find.

Judge S. James Otero's order for a 90-day delay comes two days after Cohen, President Trump's personal attorney, said he would invoke his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself in the suit, filed in the US District Court of the Central District of California. Daniels' attorney, Michael Avenatti, says he plans to file an appeal early next week, the New York Times reports. Cohen’s declaration cited the investigation by federal prosecutors in New York, who are examining his role in quashing embarrassing stories about Trump during the 2016 campaign, according to a person familiar with the matter. Otero said Friday that the issues in the civil dispute with Daniels overlap with the criminal probe into Cohen. “This is no simple criminal investigation; it is an investigation into the personal attorney of a sitting President regarding documents that might be subject to the attorney client privilege,” Otero wrote. “Whether or not an indictment is forthcoming, and the Court thinks it likely based on these facts alone, these unique circumstances counsel in favor of stay.” The development comes a day after a federal judge in Los Angeles delayed the start of the Cohen raid for 90 days while the case is appealed. Prosecutors say the raid is not only a civil case but a violation of the Constitution's ban on unreasonable search and seizure.","– A federal judge on Friday granted Michael Cohen's request for a delay in the lawsuit brought against him by porn star Stormy Daniels, saying it appeared likely Cohen will be indicted in a related criminal investigation.

3770,"– For 75 years, scientists have been trying to solve the ""Holy Grail of palaeontology"": what was in the fossil of Dickinsonia, an oval-shaped creature that lived 558 million years ago and is now the oldest known animal. They finally got their answer thanks to a cholesterol molecule in a Dickinsonia fossil found in a remote part of Russia, Phys.org reports. The cholesterol, which is still preserved in the fossils, is a hallmark of animal life. According to the study, Dickinsonia is the oldest animal ever discovered, beating out Kimberella, an early mollusk-like animal, and the worm-like Helminthoidichnites, which were around the same age. ""Scientists have been fighting for more than 75 years over what Dickinsonia and other bizarre fossils of the Ediacaran Biota were. The fossil fat now confirms Dickinsonia as the earliest known animal fossil, solving a decades-old mystery that has been the Holy Grail of Palaeontology,"" co-author Jochen Brocks says in a press release. ""Being able to study molecules from these ancient organisms was a gamechanger."" The study, published in Science, used chemical analysis of sterols, molecules that animals make ""like we find in chicken McNuggets,"" study lead author Ilya Bobrovskiy tells the Los Angeles Times. ""In this case, what you get is an average composition of the ecosystem that was living there.""","– For 75 years, scientists have been debating the true identity of Dickinsonia, the world's oldest known animal. The oval-shaped creature may have looked like a segmented jellyfish, but it was actually part of the Ediacaran biota, the first complex multi-cellular organisms to appear on Earth, and it lived 558 million years ago—millions of years earlier than previously thought. ""The fossil fat molecules that we've found prove that animals were large and abundant 558 millions years ago,"" says co-author Jochen Brocks of the Australian National University. ""Scientists have been fighting for more than 75 years over what Dickinsonia and other bizarre fossils of theEdiacaran Biota were."" Dickinsonia is believed to have arisen around the same time as the earliest known animal, a mollusk-like creature known as Kimberella, which is about the same age. ""Most rocks containing these fossils, such as those from the [Ediacara Hills] in Australia, have endured a lot of heat, a lots of pressure, and then they were weathered after that—these are the rocks that palaeontologists studied for many decades, which explained why they were stuck on the question,"" says lead researcher Ilya Bobrovskiy of the university, per Phys.org. The team found the fossil with organic matter still intact. ""I had to hang over the edge of a cliff on ropes and dig out huge blocks of sandstone, throw them down, wash the sandstone, and repeat this process until I found the fossils,"" he says. The discovery confirms ""the 'Cambrian explosion' was when complex animals such as molluscs, worms, sponges, and arthropods, and insects, and sponges.","The Ediacaran critters were an odd bunch—from ringed discs and patterned blobs to lumpy ropes and wavy fronds.

It's one of a group of lifeforms called the Ediacaran biota, which the BBC describes as the ""first complex multi-cellular organisms to appear on Earth."" But for decades they've defied definitive classification, with scientists suggesting they could be everything from lichen to giant single-celled amoeba to ""evolutionary dead-ends."" Now, an answer: Dickinsonia is an animal that dates back 558 million years, making it the earliest confirmed one in the geological record. That conclusion comes thanks to fat, reports Phys.org. Ilya Bobrovskiy of Australian National University discovered a Dickinsonia fossil in 300-foot-high cliffs along the White Sea in northwest Russia, in a place so remote she reached it via helicopter. The fossil was superbly preserved, so much so that its tissue had cholesterol molecules present in it. ""The fossil fat molecules that we've found prove that animals were large and abundant 558 million years ago, millions of years earlier than previously thought,"" says ANU professor Jochen Brocks, co-author of the paper on the discovery, which was published in Science. The Cambrian explosion that gave rise to modern animal groups didn't happen for another 20 million years or so. As for the oval Dickinsonia's appearance, the BBC describes it as possibly bearing ""a superficial resemblance to a segmented jellyfish.""

226,"– Women who eat a lot of potatoes while pregnant have a higher risk of giving birth to a child with type 2 diabetes, according to a new study. Researchers at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development at Harvard and the National Institutes of Health looked at data from more than 15,000 women who had no history of illness before pregnancy and had not had gestational diabetes before. Every four years, the women filled out a questionnaire about the kinds of foods they had eaten in the previous year, ranging from ""never"" to ""six or more times a day,"" and were asked if they'd consumed baked, boiled, mashed, or chips. The study tracked 21,693 pregnancies and 854 cases of gestational diabetes over a 10-year period. The risk was 50% higher for women who consumed two to four servings of potatoes a week. Researchers say women who switched to vegetables or whole grains at least twice a week were 10% less likely to develop gestational diabetes. Previous research has shown a link between diabetes and a high glycemic index, but this is the first study to show an association between potato consumption before pregnant and the risk of the condition, which can lead to diabetes during pregnancy. ""Our findings are biologically plausible, though the detailed underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated,"" the lead researcher tells CBS News.","– Potatoes may not be the healthiest food out there, but a new study suggests they're not so bad for pregnant women, CBS News reports.

Chait's alleged relationship with the girl started when he was an intern at the Los Angeles Times in the mid-'80s, and he's accused of having sex with her at least a dozen times over the years, including while she was in high school. The girl's mother, however, says Chait never had any sexual relationships with her daughter, and that the alleged affair began when he met the girl and her family for the first time.

2174,"– Scientists have long debated whether the left or right hemisphere is unique to humans, with some suggesting the left is uniquely qualified to process speech and others suggesting the right is exclusively used for music. But the researchers behind a new study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences think they've found evidence of a different kind of ""hemispheric specialization,"" reports National Geographic. ""It's a completely new way of looking at bat echolocation,"" study co-author Vinod Menon says in a press release. Researchers found that neurons in the auditory cortex—the part of the brain responsible for processing sounds—extend all the way to the brain's left hemisphere and process sounds coming from the right, in the same way that humans process information from the left to the right. In other words, bats may be able to process sounds from different sources at the same time. Bats not only use echolocation to find food, they also use it to learn about where and when they're in, and the discovery could help scientists better understand how bats hear, reports the New York Times.","– Scientists have long debated whether the left or right hemisphere is unique to humans, with some suggesting the left is uniquely qualified to process speech and others suggesting the right is exclusively used for music. But the researchers behind a new study in Current Biology think they've found evidence of a different kind of ""hemispheric specialization,"" reports National Geographic: a unique ""speech organ"" in the left hemisphere. Specifically, the scientists report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that the left auditory cortex—which processes pitch, loudness, timbre, and location—is distinct from the right auditory cortex, which processes consonants and vowels. As a result, the bats ""primarily orient themselves and communicate with each other using complex auditory signals."" Researchers studying the brain activity of a species of bat—the mustached bat—were surprised to find that the bat's auditory cortex is much more sensitive to echolocation than its right side. This means the bat is able to use its echolocation skills to communicate ""in a way that is much like human speech,"" study co-author Vinod Menon says in a press release. Researchers found that the bats' echolocation is ""more like a computer than a brain"" because the acoustic signals coming from the nose and mouth are processed differently. Bats and humans are separated by only a few hundredths of a second when it comes to determining the velocity of an insect's movement. Scientists studied the auditory cortex of four species of bats, including the brown bat, the wood bat, and the white-footed bat. They found that bats process sounds on the left side more effectively than the right for communication—and more for conversation. ""These findings upset the fact that they are for conversation, which are for discussion about how the conversation and the conversation about how how how the message, which ... ... ... (which, which, which a message about a message.""",,,

888,"– A former patient at a New York state center for the developmentally disabled is suing the center, state officials, and seven staff members, accusing them of abusing and torturing him, the New York Daily News reports. The patient, identified only as John Doe B, was admitted to the Bernard Fineson Developmental Center in 1994 and spent the rest of his life there. Doe B's lawsuit claims he suffered ""physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, neglect, and abuse at the hands of Fineson staff."" The lawsuit states Doe B was kept in a locked room for hours at a time, had his genitals removed, was forced to have sex with other patients, and was ""subjected to a barrage of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse."" Doe B says he was left to die in the center's care. The lawsuit claims Doe B is one of thousands of people who have been ""deprived of their most basic human rights"" as a result of the state's plan to close Fineson and replace it with community-based programs that cost the state up to $1.9 million a year for each resident. A spokesperson for Gov. Andrew Cuomo says the state is ""deeply concerned about allegations of abuse and neglect at Fineson.""

2704,"– We've experienced five mass extinctions: The Ordovician-Silurian mass extinction of 443 million years ago saw 83% of sea life wiped out, the Late Devonian mass extinction which followed 90 million years later, the Permian mass extinction, and the last one, the Great Dying, which marked the end of the dinosaurs. But while those five extinctions usually saw two species of mammals die out every 10,000 years, the current rate is 114 times that, according to a study published Friday in Science Advances. ""We were very surprised to see how bad it is,"" study co-author Gerardo Ceballos of the National Autonomous University of Mexico tells the Guardian. ""This is very depressing because we used the most conservative rates, and even then they are much higher than the normal extinction rate, really indicating we are having a massive loss of the species."" The rate of extinction for species in the 20th century was up to 100 times higher than it would have been without man, reports the New York Times. ""There are examples of species all over the world that are essentially the walking dead,"" says Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University, one of the study's co-authors. ""Avoiding a true sixth extinction will require rapid, greatly intensified efforts to conserve already threatened species, and to alleviate pressures on their populations—exploitation for economic gain and climate change.""","– Our species is on the brink of having its sixth mass extinction since the dinosaurs went extinct 66 million years ago, according to a study published Friday in Science Advances. ""We were very surprised to see how bad it is,"" study co-author Gerardo Ceballos of the National Autonomous University of Mexico tells the Guardian. ""This is very depressing because we used the most conservative rates, and even then they are much higher than the normal extinction rate, really indicating we are having a massive loss of the species."" Researchers looked at 617 vertebrate species—including 69 mammal species, 80 bird species, 24 amphibians, 146 reptiles, and 158 fish—from 1500 to the present and found that the ""background rate"" of species extinction has been somewhere between 0.1 and 1 species extinction per 10,000 species per 100 years. That's a lot lower than the ""more dramatic"" modern extinction rates of 0.2 to 1 per million species per year, or 1.8 E/MSY, researchers say. ""On human time scales, this loss would be effectively permanent because in the aftermath of past mass extinctions, the living world took hundreds of thousands to millions of years to rediversify,"" one of the study's co-authors says in a Stanford University news release, per NBC.

Enough of that: Planet Earth is undergoing a sixth mass extinction that will likely annihilate the human race unless we can curb the trend, scientists say. According to a new paper, the current rate of species extinction outpaces the natural rate far more than anyone knew, NBC News reports. The analysis ""employed better knowledge"" of Earth's natural extinction rate, the Guardian reports, upping the number from one extinction per million species annually to two extinctions. It then compared that to a current extinction rate that study authors consider conservative. Presto, they got a rate since 1900 that's eight to 100 times worse than the natural one. ""We were very surprised to see how bad it is,"" says study leader Gerardo Ceballos. ""This is very depressing."" ""If it is allowed to continue, life would take millions of years to recover, and our species itself would disappear early on,"" says Ceballos. But nations can reverse the crisis—which has been linked to deforestation, industrialization, and other human factors—by conserving threatened species and lowering pressures on their populations, the paper says. So far critics seem to buy the paper's basic math but doubt that species extinction will continue at this high rate for centuries. ""It is likely the problem will decline rapidly because most countries will be rich and care much for the natural world,"" writes one environmentalist. Earth has seen five other mass extinctions, including one 443 million years ago that killed off 83% of sea life, and the most recent, which wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago, the Telegraph notes.","– ""We're on track for a sixth mass extinction in the next 100 years. If we don't act now, we will be leaving behind a trail of dead animals and plants that will be unrecognizable to future generations."" So says George Takei, a co-author of a study published Friday in Science Advances that found the rate of extinction for species in the 20th century was up to 114 times higher than it would have been without man's impact. ""This is very depressing because we used the most conservative rates, and even then they are much higher than the normal extinction rate, really indicating we are having a massive loss of the species,"" Dr. Gerardo Ceballos of the National Autonomous University of Mexico tells the Guardian. vertebrates—including mammals, birds, and fish— comprise more than half of all species on the planet and have suffered a 52% decline over the past 40 years. The normal rate is two species dying out every 10,000 years; the current rate is 114 times that. Humans are largely to blame for the extinctions of at least 77 mammals, 140 types of bird, amphibians, and 34 since 1500, including the dodo. ""The evidence is incontrovertible that recent extinction rates are unprecedented in human history and highly unusual in Earth's history,"" the study's lead author says in a press release.

The opposition party claimed the bill would give too much power to the intelligence agency and infringed upon the privacy rights of citizens. Thousands of people attended the National Assembly to watch the opposition lawmakers speak, according to the Korea Times. Lee's speech broke the world record for the longest filibuster, set by Jung Cheong-rae of the ruling Saenuri Party, which has control of 157 seats in the 293-member National Assembly.","By Kwon Ji-youn 
 
 The world's longest filibuster went into the books Wednesday evening, leaving behind a host of records. 
 
 During the session, which began at 7.07 p.m. last Tuesday, 39 opposition lawmakers spoke for 192 hours and 25 minutes to block the vote on a disputed anti-terrorism bill that they claim will threaten personal freedom and privacy if passed into law. 
 
 On Wednesday, Rep. Lee Jong-kul, floor leader of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea, delivered an emotion-laden ...","– Think Wendy Davis' 10-hour filibuster was impressive? That was nothing compared to what dozens of lawmakers in South Korea just accomplished in the country's first filibuster in 47 years. For 192 hours and 25 minutes—or almost nine days—beginning Feb. 23, opposition Members of Parliament rambled on in an attempt to block an anti-terror bill proposed by a member of the governing party, report the BBC and Korea Times. The goal was to get to the end of the parliamentary session on March 10, but the filibuster came to a close Wednesday after attacks by the country's leaders. The bill passed hours later. At least the lawmakers still have something to show for their efforts: They smashed the world record for filibustering set in 2011 when Canadian lawmakers delayed proceedings for 57 hours. The last speaker alone spoke for 12 hours and 31 minutes to claim the record for longest individual filibuster in South Korea. Speakers wore running shoes, thumbed through huge stacks of documents, read academic articles and online comments on privacy infringement in their entirety, and recited sections of George Orwell's 1984, per Yonhap News. It was unsurprising, then, that the parliament chair was caught sleeping. The lawmakers argued the anti-terror bill—allowing for the collection of data, including phone records, on people considered security risks—would violate privacy rights, but President Park Geun-hye said the filibuster was ""nothing more than a dereliction of duty."" The public was also peeved that the stunt held up bills regarding North Korean human rights and an upcoming election.","– South Korea's opposition Minjoo Party broke a world record Wednesday night after speaking for 12 hours and 31 minutes to block a vote on an anti-terrorism bill—the longest filibuster in the country's history, the Korea Herald reports. The record-breaking speech came after 39 opposition lawmakers spoke for 192 hours and 25 minutes over nine days to block the vote on the bill, which would give the nation's intelligence service the authority to collect information on private communications, travel, and financial transactions of potential terrorists. The bill was put to a vote last week, but the opposition used the filibuster to delay it and prevent it from passing. The ruling Saenuri Party controls 157 seats in the 293-member National Assembly, meaning the bill is very likely to be passed. ""Everyone participated with enthusiasm,"" Lee Jong-kul, the party's floor leader, said, reiterating that the bill infringes upon the privacy rights of the citizens. A total of 49 lawmakers took turns speaking around the clock in opposition to the bills, claiming it would give too much power to the intelligence agency. The legislators took their time reading related bills or academic papers on privacy infringement. Thousands of South Koreans have traveled to Seoul to watch the opposition lawmakers speak, with the most-mentioned book, the BBC reports."

5042,"– Scientists say they've discovered a way to boost the heart's ability to pump blood, a finding that could have big implications for people suffering from heart failure. Currently, there's no treatment for right heart failure, which occurs when the left side of the heart fails, and the only treatment for left heart failure is a transplant. The new study, published in Cell Research, shows that a protein called Cardiotrophin 1 causes heart muscle cells to grow in a healthy way and stimulates blood vessel growth, ""just like what you would see with exercise and pregnancy,"" says Dr. Lynn Megeney, senior author of the study and a professor at the University of Ottawa. When heart cells are treated with CT-1, they become longer, healthier fibers, while those treated with a drug called phenylephrine (PE) just grow wider. When CT-1 treatment stops, the heart goes back to its original condition, just like it does when exercise or pregnancy end. ""An intriguing aspect of this research was how human CT1 was able to promote a healthy growth response in multiple animal models,"" says a co-author. ""This suggests the action of CT1 is universally conserved and puts us much closer to therapy."" The researchers say that two weeks of treatment with a pump-like device called a mini-pump improved blood flow in mice and rats for about two months, and they say it could be ready for clinical trials in two or three years. Heart failure is the leading cause of death and disability in high-income countries.","– Good news if you've ever had a heart attack: Scientists say they've found a way to boost the body's ability to repair itself. In a study published in Cell Research, researchers from the University of Ottawa's Sprott Center for Stem Cell Research and the Ottawa Hospital's Heart and Stroke Institute found that a type of white blood cell called a cardiotrophin was found in the coronary arteries of people with a history of heart attacks and strokes. Cardiotrophin acts as a ""relaxation agent"" for the heart, helping it to pump blood more easily and to repair damaged tissue, the researchers say in a press release. It also appears to be an effective treatment for heart failure, which is the second leading cause of death in the US, according to the American Heart Association. The study's lead author, Dr. Lynn Megeney, tells the CBC that it's the first time a heart disease-related stem cell has been shown to be effective in repairing the damage done to the heart by an attack. He says the next step will be to test it on people who have had heart attacks or strokes to see if it works the same way in them. (Click to read about another potentially life-saving discovery.)",,,

2489,"– The last time anyone saw Kristinn Rnarsson and Orsteinn Gujnsson, they were climbing Mount Lhotse, the world's eighth-tallest mountain at 29,029 feet. On Oct. 18, 1988, the Icelandic climbers set off on an expedition to Pumori, a 23,500-foot-tall mountain in the Himalayas near Nepal's border with Tibet. A helicopter search was launched five days after the men were last seen, but no sign of them was found until last month, when a mountaineer found their remains at the end of a glacier below the climb route, which suggests they fell into the crevasse at its base.

2350,"– When it comes to long-haul travel, jet lag is one of the biggest downsides. But with the new Airbus A350 XWB—the first aircraft to land in the US last week—the airline says it has come up with a solution, Wired reports. ""The design process was about optimization, pushing the constraints, and opening up the box of solutions,"" says Alain De Zotti, chief engineer of the plane's program. Among the improvements: bigger wings (about 20% bigger than previous generations of planes), wider seats (about 10% wider), and LED lights that change color to mimic the sun's natural glow. The filtering system changes the air in the plane every two to three minutes to keep air from stale, and the cabin is pressurized to 6,000 feet, which makes it easier for passengers to move down the aisles. The A350 also comes with more room for larger passenger seats in economy class, just an extra inch over the standard width. ""Business class is now like first class was, and first class is like little apartments,"" DeZotti says. The plane is also lighter, with more than 50% of the structure made from carbon fiber-reinforced plastic, which is less susceptible to corrosion than aluminum, Wired notes. The wings are 20% bigger. For one thing, the plane has a filter that keeps the air fresh for two or three minutes—that's enough time to adjust to the difference in altitude between your destination and the airport where you're headed. The filter keeps pressure at the equivalent of 6,200 feet—enough to allow passengers to adjust when they arrive at their destination's destination, which can be decided on where to arrive at a particular airport where they'll be held at a restaurant.

Airbus is making the bold claim that it can at least reduce the malady for those aboard its new A350 XWB line of jets. The main tool is a set of LED lights within the cabin that mimics natural shifts in sunlight and theoretically keeps people's natural circadian rhythms in sync, reports Fast Company. Another factor: Because of the planes' relatively light frames, they can be pressurized to 6,000 feet, which the airline says allows for more humidity and makes the air pressure inside the aircraft closer to the pressure on the ground than is the case with most jets, per Quartz. A third factor is the jet's filtration system, which replaces the air in the cabin in its entirety every two to three minutes. The idea there is that, if nothing else, the improved air quality should help people sleep better on long flights. And the big question: Has it worked? It's a little too early to tell.

It also features a filter that changes the air every two to three minutes to keep stale air from entering the cabin. The A350's interior is also designed to be adaptable so that carriers can swap out seats and configuration much more easily than in the past.

Cainan arrived four hours later, weighing 7 pounds, 3 ounces and 19 inches. He's the first child for the couple, who met almost 10 years ago on an online dating site and have been married for the past year and a half. Lindsay is a stay-at-home mom to their other three children, ages 8, 3, and 21 months. Lamar, an ammunition specialist in the Army, was unable to move to New Hampshire because of military service—""We always used to joke about having 10 kids when we first got together, but I think we're going to be taking a break for a while after this one."" That's how Lindsay and Lamar Smith of Opelika, Ala., posted about the birth of their fourth child on Facebook on Monday. ""He's here and he's a great baby. But Lamar was fired on New Hampshire for his job security, which he couldn't work because of a state's family with family with a time, which the family of family (the family—and he was told that he was so he was without the job—he was without his the job.","– On New Year's Eve, Lamar Austin drove his pregnant wife to the hospital, where she gave birth to the couple's first child, a boy named Cainan. ""I thought, 'Family comes before anything else,'"" the Army veteran tells the New Hampshire Union Leader. ""If I have to choose between work and family, I'm always going to pick my family."" But his boss at Salerno Protective Services—""like his baby, and I had my baby, which was just being born,"" Austin says—had a different take. ""Naturally, he's going to picked his baby over my baby. I can't blame him for that."" The 30-year-old Army veteran had been hired to work as a part-time security guard for a 90-day trial period, but he wasn't covered by the state's Family and Medical Leave Act, which offers workers up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave. New Hampshire doesn't have a family and medical leave law or program, nor does the federal government. Austin says he was told he'd be fired if he didn't show up for his two shifts, but because the state is an ""at-will"" state, he says he couldn't be fired for missing work due to the birth of a child. Since the Union Leader ran its story, at least three job offers have been made to Austin, and a GoFundMe page has been set up for him and his family.",,,

3809,"– The superintendent of a small Kansas school district resigned Tuesday after two high school journalists published an investigative piece that led to his ouster. The Booster Redux, a student-run newspaper, printed a front-page story on the resignation of Russell Robertson, the superintendent of the Hoisington school district. In the piece, the students revealed that Robertson had been accused of sexual misconduct in the past, including an alleged affair with a female student, but that he had continued to lead the district as superintendent. After Robertson's resignation, national journalists—including David Fahrenthold of the Washington Post—tweeted the students' story, congratulating them for their work. ""To know that the administration saw that and respected that, it was a really great moment for us,"" the Booster Redux's editor-in-chief tells the Topeka Capital-Journal.","– When Pittsburg High School in Kansas hired Amy Robertson as its new principal last month, the school board called her ""the best fit,"" saying she had ""decades of experience in education."" Problem is, Robertson doesn't have any of those decades of experience, the Kansas City Star reports. Robertson, who'd lived in Dubai for 19 years, isn't licensed in Kansas, and her master's and doctorate degrees from a private college in the United Arab Emirates, where she's lived for the last decade, don't appear to be legit. Corllins University, where Robertson got her degrees, hasn't responded to emails from the Star about its status. The school's newspaper, the Booster Redux, published a story Friday questioning the legitimacy of the college, which the Department of Education couldn't find.

3876,"– Vitamin B12 helps the brain, nerves, and blood work properly, and it's found in meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, and Marmite. But some people take the vitamin, which is also found in vitamins A, C, and D, and end up with acne, reports LiveScience. So researchers set out to find out why. Their findings, published today in Science Translational Medicine, could eventually lead to better treatments for acne. ""It has been reported several times that people who take B12 develop acne,"" says Huiying Li, a molecular pharmacologist at the University of California-Los Angeles and a co-author of the study. ""So it’s exciting that we found that the potential link between B12 and acne is through the skin bacteria."" Li's team found that people taking B12 have high levels of Propionibacterium acnes, the bacteria that causes acne. The vitamin lowers the bacteria's production of B12, which causes it to produce more porphyrins, which are also linked to inflammation. ""The main message is that skin bacteria are important,"" says Li. ""They're contributing members of our skin's society, and they like to do things in a certain way.""","– If you take vitamin B12, you may want to steer clear of acne-prone skin. UCLA researchers say they've found a link between vitamin B12 and Propionibacterium acnes, the skin bacteria most associated with acne, LiveScience reports. ""I think there's a link,"" says a co-author of the study. ""There's still a lot to be studied in order to really understand if B12 causes acne."" The researchers looked at the gene expression of the skin microbe in people with acne and people without acne. They found that the pathway that produces vitamin B 12 was altered, and this changed the bacteria's gene expression, which could have led to acne-promoting inflammation. They then studied the skin of people who received a B12 injection, and found that one of the 10 participants broke out in pimples a week after receiving the injection. That person's P. acnes gene-expression pattern also changed, the researchers found. ""This study does present some compelling evidence suggesting that supplementation with B12 can cause or exacerbate acne in a subset of individuals,"" says one dermatology professor. But, he adds, ""Proof of a causative effect of B12 supplements on acne development will require randomized control trials with enough.""",,,

The New York Times reports researchers asked 414 people who'd been stopped by police to rate the level of ""respect,"" ""impartial,"" ""friendly,"" ""formal,"" and ""professional"" language used by the officers during the stop. The subjects rated officers' language based on how respectful they were toward the person they were stopped by, as well as the officers' level of formality (e.g., ""ma'am"" or ""sir""). The study looked at body camera footage from officers in Oakland, Calif., who stopped 1,440 drivers, 68.1% of whom were black and the rest white, from April 2014 to April 2015. Participants rating officers' words on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the most respectful, per a press release. Officers' words toward black drivers were rated as “less respectful,” “polite,” “friendly,” “impartial,” “formal,” and “respectful,” while white drivers received 57% more respect than black drivers. ""This work demonstrates the power of body-cam footage as an important source of data, not just as evidence,"" the researchers say, per the Los Angeles Times.","– A new study finds police officers speak less respectfully to black drivers even when controlling for race, severity of infraction, stop location, and stop outcome, the Los Angeles Times reports. ""Such disparities in common, everyday interactions between police and the communities they serve have important implications for procedural justice and the building of police–community trust,"" researchers write in the study, published in PLOS One. The study looked at 414 interactions between black drivers and police officers in five US cities over a two-year period. The subjects rated officers' level of respect based on five categories: respectful, impartial, friendly, polite, and formal. White drivers were rated the same as black drivers when it came to respectful—they were more likely to be called ""ma'am"" or ""sir,"" and they were more often to hear the words ""please"" and ""thank you,"" reports the BBC. Black drivers, on the other hand, were called by their first names (including ""my man"") and were less likely to use ""disfluencies"" and informal titles like ""My Man"" than when they speak to white drivers.",,,
5072,"– Donald Trump's plan to deport millions of undocumented immigrants could be just the start of a ""systematic dismantling"" of the nation's immigration system, experts say. Experts say Trump could easily deport 2 million people during his first term without congressional approval, the New York Times reports. ""It would not be hard to get up to 2 million in four years, and most of them would be quote-unquote criminals,"" says Randy Capps of the Migration Policy Institute. Trump has said he wants to deport the entire 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US, including so-called ""Dreamers,"" children who were brought to the US illegally as children. President Obama has urged Trump to ""think long and hard"" before endangering young undocumented immigrants protected from deportation by his executive actions. ""I will urge the president-elect and the upcoming administration to think long andhard before they are endangering the status of what for all practical purposes are American kids,"" Obama said at a news conference Sunday, per the Los Angeles Times. There are about 1.9 million ""removable criminal aliens"" in the country, including both undocumented immigrants and noncitizens who have been convicted of crimes, the Times notes.","– Donald Trump has promised to round up all 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US and deport them as soon as he takes office—but there may not be that many people he actually wants to deport. In a 60 Minutes interview that aired Sunday, Trump said he would focus on the immigrants who have criminal records and are in the country illegally, but he would also consider people who are here illegally but have served in the military, the New York Times reports. ""We're going to deal with them one at a time,"" he said. ""I'm not going to make a decision until I see what's going on. It's either amnesty or I'm going to deport them all.""

2745,"– Six students from a prestigious private all-boys Catholic school in Toronto were arrested yesterday and charged with sexual assault in connection with a video that was posted online last week, the AP reports. The teens, who are all 14 and 15, are charged with assault, gang sexual assault, and sexual assault with a weapon. Police say the school failed to immediately notify police of the assault, which occurred on campus at St. Michael's College, and the media became aware of it.

The group, discovered by two British divers late Monday, are on a dry rock ledge around 2.5 miles from the mouth of the cave, and the Thai military says it could be months before it can get them out, unless the boys learn to dive, the BBC reports. The cave in northern Thailand often remains flooded until the end of the rainy season in September or October, meaning the youth soccer team and their coach may need to have food and other supplies sent in for the next four months. Experts warn that it could be very difficult to get the boys, ages 11 to 16, to safety through miles of dark, narrow, flooded tunnels. ""Trying to take non-divers through a cave is one of the most dangerous situations possible, even if the dives are relatively easy,"" US National Cave Rescue Commission coordinator Anmar Mirza tells the AP. Thai officials say they're committed to ""100% safety"" and will continue to explore their options, including draining water from the cave system and searching for shafts that could provide an alternative escape route.

They have been provided with high-protein liquid food and will be given more supplies and visited by doctors in the days to come.","– The 12 boys and their soccer coach found alive in a cave in Thailand on Monday have had their first taste of freedom in 10 days.

The military earlier said the boys would need to learn to dive—or wait up to four months for flooding to recede. More heavy rain could see water levels rise and threaten the air pocket where the group has taken refuge. Interior Minister Anupong Paojinda later stressed the urgency of the evacuation, adding that rain was forecast ""in the next few days."" Attempts are being made to reduce the risk of further flooding of the caves by pumping water from the underground system, Mr. Anupong said.

The study, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, looked at the health records of nearly 4,000 women over a 20-year period. The women were split into three groups: Those who used talc products (including products containing asbestos-free talc), those who didn't use them, and those who used talcum powder. The researchers found no difference in cancer rates between the groups, though there was a noticeable increase in the rate of ovarian cancer among women who used the powder. talc, which is also used in feminine products such as tampons and sanitary napkins, was found to have asbestos in its natural form, which miners may have been exposed to while working underground. However, all talc products used in the US since the 1970s, including baby powder and facial powders, have been asbestos- free, the American Journal of Cancer Research notes. ""The results of this study do not demonstrate a cause-and-effect relationship between the use of talcum powder and cancer,"" a rep for Johnson & Johnson says.

The policy specifically covers illness or ""accident or illness ... prevents any person from appearing or continuing to appear any or all of the person's capricious behavior,"" according to its translation.

3730,"– The Grey, starring Liam Neeson and Rachel McAdams, tells the story of a group of men stranded in the Alaskan wilderness after their plane crashes. It’s a bleak, frozen, and harshly beautiful corner of Alaska, and Neeson conveys a ferocious and absolute seriousness even when the going gets silly, writes AO Scott in the New York Times. It is a fine, tough little movie, technically assured and brutally efficient, with a simple story that ventures into some profound existential territory without making a big fuss about it. “The sadistic, macho bluster of those movies seemed, at best, a gesture of mock rebellion, something to make football fans and beer drinkers feel like warriors,” writes Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times. “But The Grey unfolds in a mood of grimness and is grounded in an idea of masculinity under duress that is no less authentic for being thoroughly sentimental.” The Grey is “a stripped-down, elemental tale of survival in brutal circumstances, as blunt and effective—and also, at times, as lyrical—as a tale by Jack London or Ernest Hemingway,” writes Betsy Sharkey in the Los Angeles Times. “It is hard, in this cozy, wired-up, GPS world, to imagine circumstances in which human beings would be so completely at.” For more reviews, click here.","– The Grey, starring Liam Neeson and directed by Joe Carnahan, tells the story of a group of men stranded in the Alaskan wilderness after their plane crashes.

""The Grey is notable for the thoughtfulness and sensitivity with which it addresses the thorny ethical and metaphysical matters of mortality. It takes death seriously, and partly as a consequence, every moment, every frame, feels alive."" ""A guy even wolves should be scared of in the gripping thriller The Grey,"" writes James Berardinelli in ReelViews. "" Neeson is perfect for this stuff.

4049,"– ""I am beside myself. Now he is threatening me, saying I can never leave."" Those are the words of a woman from Mississippi who wrote to the Guardian seeking help for an abortion she couldn't afford on her own. She's one of thousands of women—including homeless women and middle-class women, married women and single women, and women separated from the nearest abortion provider by ocean—who have turned to the internet for help, the New York Times reports. They're seeking misoprostol, an abortion-inducing drug that can be purchased over the counter in many Central American pharmacies. In the US, it's illegal to administer the drug outside of medical clinics, but Yanow says that's not the case with US women. ""Though it is an option for me in the United States, in reality, it is not really an option because the $600-$700 to have it done is simply out of the question. I am absolutely desperate,"" writes Martina, a 26-year-old Texas woman who reached out to the Dutch nonprofit Women on Web for help ending her pregnancies via self-induced abortions. The group says it received more than 600 such emails in 2015—and Martina was one of the hundreds who contacted the Guardian to share her story. ""When people think about low-income women seeking abortion, they have this stereotypical vision of a single woman on welfare,"" says the head of the group. The drug is made from the same ingredients as mifepristone, which is banned in most states after 20 weeks, and which can be used for late-term abortions. But the method is becoming increasingly popular among women who don't want to wait for abortions until they become pregnant, which has been considered a ""one of the first, which could be a ""the only thing that could explain how they could explain why they could have a problem.""

That's how a 28-year-old woman identified only as Martina describes her experience with misoprostol, a drug that can be used to induce an abortion in the US. The New York Times reports the woman paid $26 for a carton of the drug, then traveled to Mexico, where she found a pharmacy that sold it. She then returned to the US, only to discover she couldn't get it there because she was still too nauseous to take it while in Mexico, so she would have to travel to Mexico City to end the pregnancy. The woman left the US after she was unable to find a clinic that would give her the drug. The Dutch not-for-profit Women on Web says it received more than 600 emails from US women seeking a way to end their pregnancies via self-induced abortion in 2015. ""I feel like there's such a negative stigma to this. It's kind of kept under the radar, hushed, so it needs to be talked about,"" Martina tells the Guardian.

The lion, named Mohawk, had been cornered and taunted by locals for six hours before he lunged at a man riding a boda boda in Isinya, Kajiado county. The man was hospitalized with deep lacerations and bruises. The Kenya Wildlife Service says it was ""a last resort after an escalation of the situation and a concern for public safety."" It's the third time in two months that lions have escaped from the park.

While conservationists say habitat loss is the main reason for the lion escapes, others point to human development as another factor. In South Africa, a lion named Sylvester has been on the lam from South African officials for years. Sylvester has made his way out of a national park on the other side of the continent, prompting a Twitter hashtag and an online petition to save him. Officials in Limpopo National Park say they'll put the big cat down if they can't catch him, but the #SaveSylvester hashtag on Twitter and a Change.org petition have so far garnered more than 25,000 signatures.","– A man was mauled to death in Nairobi, Kenya, yesterday after he tried to take a selfie with a lion that had escaped from a national park, the New York Times reports.

But there's a simple solution, and it's one that's been around for a while: put a little ice on your hands and use a snow shovel with a firm, straight grip. That's according to a study published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, which found that people who used a ""straight grip"" on their snow shovels for at least two hours a day reported less pain than those who used an ""extensor grip"" or a ""slippery grip."" The good news? These grips—which come in a variety of styles and colors—are made by MOTUS, a company that claims they ""offer arthritis relief and reduce the risk of repetitive strain injuries."" The bad news? Those who don't use a straight grip will end up twisting their wrists while doing the same thing, which can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome and other problems. Try putting your hands in a ""T-grip"" on your shovel—if you've ever wished you could lift with a straight arm, well, you're in luck: A new study suggests that using a straightgrip instead of a hand can reduce the risks of tendinitis in the shoulder, the New York Times reports. The researchers tested the hand-grip's ability on 14 cadavers, all of whom were able to lift with their arms straight. They found that the arm's abductor muscles became less active in the straight-grip group.","– At the turn of the 20th century, manual laborers were considered some of the most dangerous jobs in America, according to a letter written by a doctor to a labor union president. The letter, published in the American Journal of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, recommended that laborers use their arms more than their legs to push shovels into piles, and that they press their arms hard against the upper part of their legs instead of using ""the muscular effort of your arms,"" which was ""tiresome."" The letter's author, William Taylor, was inspired to write it after he saw how hard laborers had to work to keep their heads above water, the New York Times reports. In the century since, African-Americans have become a much more feared and respected group, and their physical well-being has become a major concern for society.

1792,"– A former Oklahoma City police officer convicted of raping and sexually assaulting 13 black women while on duty was sentenced to 263 years in prison Thursday, NBC News reports. Daniel Holtzclaw, 29, was found guilty of 18 counts related to eight women who said he raped or sexually assaulted them while he was on duty in one of Oklahoma City's poorest neighborhoods. His defense argued that Holtzclaw had been trying to help drug addicts and prostitutes he encountered in his work. His lawyers asked for a new trial Wednesday, alleging prosecutors didn't disclose new evidence—including DNA evidence—during the trial. On Thursday, Holtzclaw—who is half-white and half-Japanese—was sentenced in line with the jury's recommendation. ""All the women were victims, from the 17-year old teenager to the 57-year old grandmother,"" CNN quotes the judge as saying.

Former Oklahoma City police officer Daniel Holtzclaw, who raped and sexually assaulted 13 black women while on duty, was sentenced to 263 years in prison Thursday, NBC News reports. Holtzclaw was found guilty last month on 18 counts related to eight women who said he had forced them to perform sex acts, and one woman who was only 17 when he assaulted her. During his trial, 13 of Holtzclaw's victims testified about being raped or sexually assaulted by him while he was on duty in one of Oklahoma City's poorest neighborhoods. His defense argued that Holtzclaw had been trying to help drug addicts and prostitutes he encountered in his work. His lawyers asked for a new trial Wednesday, alleging prosecutors didn't disclose new evidence—including DNA evidence—during the trial. On Thursday, Holtzclaw—who is half-white and half-Japanese—was sentenced in line with the jury's recommendation.",,,

The city had initially reported the alligator as a caiman, which is similar to an alligator, but the Discovery Center told the city later in the day that it was an American alligator, reports the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. It's not clear how long the alligator was in the lake with its mouth shut, but Carmichael says it looked to be on the thin side from what he's seen so far. He expects the center to know within three to five days how serious the situation is, but as long as there aren't any major issues like a bacterial infection, he thinks they should be able to get the animal turned around.","– David Castaneda was kayaking Monday morning off the coast of Waukegan, Ill., when he spotted what he thought was a dead salmon in the water.

3625,"– The size of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has tripled in a day or so, growing from a spill the size of Rhode Island to something closer to Puerto Rico, according to images collected from mostly European satellites and analyzed by the University of Miami. The Coast Guard has estimated that about 200,000 gallons of oil have spilled since the April 20 explosion that killed 11 workers. The environmental mess could eclipse the Exxon Valdez disaster, when an oil tanker spilled 11 million gallons off Alaska's shores in 1989. Documents also emerged showing BP downplayed the possibility of a catastrophic accident at the offshore rig that exploded. How far the spill will reach is unknown, but the sheen already has reached into precious shoreline habitat and remains unstopped, raising fears that the ruptured well could be pouring more oil into the gulf than estimated, reports the AP. President Obama planned a Sunday trip to the Gulf Coast to see the damage himself. Even if the materials, called dispersants, are effective, BP has already bought up more than a third of the world's supply. If the leak from 5,000 feet beneath the surface continues for weeks, or months, that stockpile could run out. “There is a chemical toxicity to the dispersant compound that in many ways is worse than oil,” said Richard Charter, a foremost expert on marine biology and oil spills. “It’s a trade-off—you’re damned if you do, darned if you don’t—of trying to minimize the damage coming to shore, but in so doing you may be more seriously damaging the ecosystem offshore.”","– The size of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has tripled in a day or so, growing from a spill the size of Rhode Island to something closer to Puerto Rico, according to images collected from mostly European satellites and analyzed by the University of Miami.

""This is the most far-away galaxy we've confirmed,"" says the lead researcher. ""We are seeing this galaxy as it was 700 billion years after the BigBang."" The galaxy's light has been stretched to a redshift of 7.5, beating the previous record of 7.21. ""It could be that they are hidden from detection behind a wall of neutral hydrogen,"" an astronomer says. ""The galaxy is a little smaller than our own Milky Way,"" but it's still producing stars, he adds. ""One very interesting way to learn about the Universe is to study these outliers and that tells us something about what sort of physical processes are dominating galaxy formation and galaxy evolution. The further away we go, the closer we will get to discovering the very first stars that ever formed in the Universe.""","– Astronomers using Hubble Space Telescope images have discovered the oldest galaxy yet formed in the early universe. Galaxy z8_GND_5296 formed 700 million years after the Big Bang, when the universe was just 5% of its current age. The galaxy is producing stars extremely rapidly, much more rapidly than the Milky Way. This is consistent with other galaxies that formed within a billion years of the BigBang. ""The most reliable way to select galaxies is to use the color because the further out you go in the universe, galaxies get redder and redder,"" a UC Riverside astronomer tells CBS. ""So, that is an indication of the distance."" At 13.1 billion light years from Earth, it's about 30 billion light-years from us—far enough away that astronomers were able to measure how far it was from us by analyzing its color, the BBC reports. ""This is the most far-flung galaxy we've confirmed,"" says the lead researcher. ""We are seeing this galaxy as it was 700 million year after theBig Bang."" The galaxies themselves would be filled with the newly formed, massive stars, many of which could be a thousand times the mass of our own sun, says Casey Papovich, one of the lead authors of the study in Nature. We have yet to identify any conclusive evidence that these 'first-generation' stars exist in even this distant galaxy.""",,,

1920,"– The US government could shut down at the stroke of midnight tonight if the Senate doesn't pass a spending bill by Monday afternoon, reports Politico. Here's what you need to know: The House has already passed a bill to fund the government through Dec. 15, and John Boehner is pushing for a delay in the new health care law for a year and a repeal of the medical device tax that is part of it, reports the Wall Street Journal. Senate Democrats have said they won't accept any changes to the health law, and President Obama has said he'll veto any bill that includes such a measure. But the Journal notes that Republicans believe they have the votes in the Senate to get rid of the tax. If that happens, the Senate could pass a short-term spending bill for a week or so, and then pressure both parties to reach a deal in the coming days. Harry Reid has been pushing hard for a deal, but Politico reports that he privately urged Obama not to hold a meeting with the four congressional leaders ahead of the deadline. Washington, DC, is home to the largest concentration of federal workers in the nation, and if the government shuts down tonight—as expected—that could cost the region $200 million a day, and more than 700,000 jobs, the Washington Post reports.

""Unfortunately I remember that moment very well because I haven't stopped thinking about it since it happened,"" Mel Greig told Australia's Seven Network, according to the AFP. ""And I remember my first question was, was she a mother?"" In a separate interview with the Nine Network, Michael Christian added: ""It came into my head that I just wanted to reach out to them (the family), give them a big hug and say sorry. I hope they're OK, I really do."" The two also gave interviews to the Seven and Nine networks. The CEO of 2Day FM's parent company tells the Guardian that the station tried to contact King Edward VII Hospital on the phone before the call went to air. ""We rang them to discuss what we had recorded. We attempted to contact them on no fewer than five times. We wanted to speak to them about it."" The death of Jacintha Saldanha, the nurse who took the prank call, has been ruled a suicide."
3441,"– The mystery author behind O: A Presidential Novel, due out later this month, has “been in the room with Barack Obama” and has “spent years observing politics,” publisher Simon & Schuster says. The 368-page novel, set in the future during the 2012 presidential election, is described as a “fast, well-plotted bit of campaign fiction, an honorable genre, bogged down only at times by too much campaign detail,” according to the New York Times. The author “has a solid grasp of Obamaland, with the obvious characters like David Axelrod (Avi Samuelson) sketched clearly, and another character, who seems to be a composite of people I can guess at, in the role of a spurned but loyal Chicago Obama protege,” writes Michael Wolff in the Washington Post. But “its real calling card is the author's anonymity, and there's some fun to be had on those terms,” Wolff continues. “For one thing, the author has a real grasp of campaigns—but mostly as far as campaigns' relations with the press go, which suggests the author’s either a political reporter or a press staffer of some sort. There's a newsroom based on Politico, but the surly, micro-managing.”","– Junot Diaz's latest novel, The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, is out today, and the reviews are pouring in. Here's what people are saying: It's a ""juicy read"" that's ""both smart and entertaining,"" writes Mary Elizabeth Williams at Salon. But it's also ""satirical"" and ""slowly building to a fever pitch."" Diaz, it seems, ""never really fleshes out the inner workings"" of her main character's life, which ""seems to be a composite of people I can guess at, in the role of a spurned but loyal Chicago Obama protege."" In fact, the book ""doesn't reveal all that much,"" writes Ron Charles at the Washington Post. Williams also points out that the main character is a former ""courtesan to the wealthy and powerful"" who is ""infamously changeable"" and disloyal, ""with just 'one abiding passion: her own notoriety.'""

4716,"– A 25-year-old mentally ill woman in Belgium has become the first person to be euthanized under a new law that makes euthanasia illegal for those with ""unbearable suffering."" Cornelia de Schutter, who suffers from depression and borderline personality disorder, asked to die last month and was given the go-ahead by her doctor, the BBC reports. The law, which takes effect Jan. 1, will make it harder for doctors to refuse requests from mentally ill patients. ""If I want to end my life, all of a sudden, I can’t think straight anymore? That’s something strange,"" she says. But the law's opponents say mentally ill people shouldn't be forced to end their lives. ""I think if the doctors had tried to help her more or proposed other things, she might have felt there was another solution,"" says the sister of a woman who was mentally ill. Belgium is one of only two countries in the world where euthanasia is legal for people with psychiatric illnesses, and the family of Tine Nys is now accusing three doctors of ""poisoning"" her and helping her end her life, the AP reports. ""She knew that if she wasn’t diagnosed with autism or Asperger’s that she would not have a chance (of being euthanized),"" says her sister.","– When Cornelia De Schutter was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder as a child, ""I could get a loan, I could buy a car, I can buy a house (and) do everything that I want to,"" the 29-year-old Belgian woman tells the New York Times. But if she wanted to end her life, ""all of a sudden I can't think straight anymore? That's something strange."" Her story is just one of many to make headlines in Belgium, where euthanasia for the mentally ill is on the rise and where some doctors say it's time for stricter oversight. The country's public health minister once helped raise money for one of the clinics run by Dr. Jean-Philippe Thienpont, who has been accused of improperly approving euthanasia requests for mentally ill patients. In one high-profile case, Thienpont was accused of approving the euthanasia of a woman with borderline personality disorder, even though she'd tried all sorts of therapies. ""I wish there had been another way,"" the woman's sister says. Belgium's euthanasia law requires ""unbearable suffering"" be shown before a patient can be euthanized, but critics say the law gives individual doctors too much leeway.",,,
3116,"– The situation at Japan's Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant is worse than Chernobyl, government officials announced today, raising the event level from 5 to 7—the highest level on the International Atomic Energy Agency's scale and the same level assigned to the 1986 disaster at Chernobyl, reports Time. The decision came after officials determined that the plant had been releasing 10,000 terabecquerels of iodine-131 for several hours at one point, and that the amount of radioactive material being released is less than 1 terabecquerel so far. The only other event to come close to a 7 was a 1957 accident at a fuel-processing plant (where spent nuclear fuel is recycled into new fuel) in Russia, in which an off-site release of radiation prompted preventive evacuations. “The INES rating itself is not an indicator of a daily phenomena but the assessment after careful consideration and calculation on the event that happened in the past,” says a spokesman for Japan’s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency. The government also expanded the evacuation zone around Fukushima to include several towns within a 19-mile radius where residents had been told they could remain at home but were recommended to stay indoors.

2446,"– A new study suggests that a diet high in fiber can help fight obesity, the Christian Science Monitor reports. Researchers at Imperial College London fed mice high-fructose corn syrup and low-fructose fructan-enriched inulin, both of which contain fructose, to groups of mice and found that both diets resulted in similar energy intake and body weight, New Scientist reports. But the mice on the HFD-I diet gained more weight than those on theHFD-C diet, according to the study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Researchers injected a chemical called acetate into the brains of rats, they say, they were able to alter a part of the brain associated with mood, memory, and impulse control. The animals' brains were then hooked up to MRI machines, where they were shown images of changes in the structures of their brains, reports the New York Times. ""It's the first time that acetate has been shown to behave like mice,"" the lead researcher says in a press release. Mice injected with the compound drank more, ate more, and behaved more like mice than those injected with. The findings could lead to new drugs to treat obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease.","– A substance found in plastic bags could someday help treat everything from allergies to Parkinson's disease, according to a new study. Researchers injected acetate into the brains of rats and found that the substance made the creatures more alert, less prone to falls, and less likely to engage in risky behavior, the Guardian reports. ""This is the first time that acetate has been shown to have a protective effect against a wide range of human diseases,"" the study's lead author says in a press release. ""It's a huge step forward."" Until now, a high-fibre diet was thought to help keep weight down by stimulating the release of appetite-suppressing hormones in the gut, but humans do not seem to show the same increase in these hormones that mice do. So Bell and his colleagues decided: If fiber-rich foods like cereal bars and chicory coffee make you feel full, it's because you've got an anti-appetite molecule in your gut that tells you to stop eating. The molecule, called acetate, is released when fiber is digested in thegut and is taken to the brain, where it triggers a series of chemical events that suppress hunger. As Live Science explains, previous research suggested the reason was that it takes longer to digest, keeping us satisfied for longer after we've stopped eating. But this new research shows for the first times that fiber actually triggers the release, which signals we're full.",,,

Watson said he was ""mortified"" by the uproar over his comments, which he described as ""absurd"" and ""irresponsible,"" reports the BBC.

It's not clear whether the comments were intended to be reported on, or if they were just a private call made over the phone, but MSNBC immediately ran a ""Breaking News"" chyron about them on Morning Joe.

Biggest problem, to me, in the world, is nuclear, and proliferation."") Not in on his latest stance, apparently: his own team.

In the video, Kassig is blindfolded and forced to watch as he is dragged from a building, thrown into a river, and then executed.

Turkish traders are shipping the energy drink and other items into Syria across borders that are controlled by rebels belonging to ISIS, the Free Syrian Army, and the Islamic Front, and business is apparently booming: According to trade stats out of Ankara, Turkey sent $1.3 billion in goods to Syria through September, its highest total for a nine-month period ever recorded, Bloomberg reports. Those who wield power over the border—and right now that's militants in at least three border towns—are the ones who reap the profits, pocketing tolls and fees from transporters. While Turkish customs and economy officials either wouldn't comment or didn't respond to Bloomberg, the owner of a Turkish trucking company said that ""every day we have four or five trucks carrying Red Bulls to Syria."" He adds that those picking up the goods on the Syrian side don't ID themselves, and the imports are then loaded onto Syrian trucks and driven away. Meanwhile, caffeinated militants may also be fortified by the ""good wives of jihadi"": The Independent recently documented a new ISIS media arm that posts and tweets out nursing, morale, and cooking advice for militants' wives, including recipes to ""replenish the mujahidin.""

ISIS fighters ""broke into"" the city overnight and killed dozens of security forces, the provincial governor's office says, marking the second major defeat for the country's government in the space of a week. Ramadi had been the capital of Anbar province and home to around 1 million people. A US official tells the Telegraph that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been ""incapacitated"" by a US airstrike and is being treated by two doctors from the group's stronghold of Mosul who are ""strong ideological supporters of the group.""

2131,"– Scientists have discovered that tadpoles of a species of horned frog emit a ""brief, clear, and very audible metallic-like sound"" when they're in distress. It's the first time any vertebrate larva has been found to use sound to communicate underwater, Earth News reports. The Argentine horned frog is a remarkable species for its tendency to try eating anything that passes, and it's possible that the scream is mainly emitted when another horned frog tadpole moves to attack it as a measure to avoid cannibalism. The discovery could have profound implications for amphibians, many of which are threatened by disease, habitat destruction, and illegal trade. ""We have definitely underestimated their abilities,"" says the lead researcher. ""In more than 200 years of this has never been reported.""","– Scientists have discovered that tadpoles of a species of horned frog emit a ""brief, clear, and very audible metallic-like sound"" when they're in distress.

The Argentine horned frog is a remarkable species for its tendency to try eating anything that passes, and it's possible that the scream is mainly emitted when another horned frog tadpole moves to attack it as a measure to avoid cannibalism. The discovery, reported in the Swedish journal Acta Zoological, is the first evidence for the production of sound by the larvae of anurans (frogs and toads). It was made by Dr. Guillermo Natale of the National University of La Plata in Buenos Aires, and his colleagues, when they were studying the mating calls and croakings of adult frogs. Many adult amphibians use loud sounds such as croaks to advertise their presence, and often to attract sexual partners, but until now researchers did not realize amphibian larvae might also produce sounds underwater. Natale caught a horned Frog tadpole in a pond using a hand-held net. ""We heard a brief, clear (and very audible) metallic- like sound,"" he says, per the BBC. The frogs emit a distress call when they are still in the water, but they also make it when removed from the water and when they become froglets.",,,

The model, published Wednesday in Scientific Reports, shows that the dinosaur's skin is made up of what researchers call ""interstitium,"" a series of fluid-filled compartments below the skin that line the animal's gut, lungs, blood vessels, and muscles. ""It's very similar to what you would see in the tissue of a mammal,"" study co-author Dr. Supat Thammasitboon tells the New York Times. ""You wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a dinosaur and a human.""

But they didn't have much time to process them—the first came 7 seconds before impact, reports the Wall Street Journal. Three seconds after the first ""sink rate"" alarm sounded in the cockpit, one of the two pilots said the runway was in sight, but the plane soon clipped power wires and slammed into a hill. A veteran pilot was at the controls: Cerea Beal had 8,600 flying hours with UPS—3,000 alone in A300 cargo planes, the type that went down—and before that served as a Maine helicopter pilot. But it's unclear whether he had ever landed at this particular runway before at Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport.

4740,"– The fight over climate change legislation is heating up in the Senate, with Democrats arguing over when it should reach the floor. “Most of the country doesn’t know what cap-and-trade is,” Commerce Committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller tells the Hill. “They have no idea.” Rockefeller is one of six Democratic chairmen working on the issue, and he thinks it should wait until after the midterms. “You have to get this stuff out to the American people before you change their lives, and we are not paying any attention to that,” he says. But Barbara Boxer, chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee, wants a vote as soon as possible. “I’d love to get it done tomorrow,” she says. “There would be nothing better than for us to talk about over the summer than Democrats pushing a huge new energy tax,” says a Republican leadership aide.","– President Obama's call for a ""politically binding"" climate agreement at next month's Copenhagen summit has backfired big-time. China, the US, and other nations have dropped their demand for a binding deal, reports the Wall Street Journal. The Obama administration, however, is moving ahead with a plan to have the EPA declare greenhouse gases a danger to public health. That would trigger potential regulations that could affect a wide swath of the economy. The delay is a sign of political will on the part of Democrats, who are worried about a backlash from voters in industrial and heartland states dependent on coal. “It's really big, really, really hard, and is going to make a lot of people mad,” said Sen. Claire McCaskill. But John McCain said the delay was “just a matter of reality, they can't get anything done at this time.” The Senate Finance Committee likely won't begin deliberations on the climate bill until January, according to Sen.

2795,"– Longtime Alcoholics Anonymous members may have an ""innate ability to use the AA experience—prayer in this case—to minimize the effect of alcohol triggers in producing craving,"" says senior author Marc Galanter of NYU Langone Medical Center. In a study published in the American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse, researchers recruited 20 long-term AA members who reported no cravings for alcohol during the week preceding testing. The participants were placed in an MRI scanner and then shown either pictures of alcoholic drinks or people drinking to simulate drinking behavior in a laboratory setting. The pictures were presented twice: first after asking the participant to read neutral material from a newspaper, and again after the participant recited an AA prayer promoting abstinence from alcohol to represent the impact of AA. All research subjects reported some degree of craving for alcohol after viewing the images, and less craving after reciting anAA prayer. MRI data revealed that there were changes in parts of the prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain that controls attention, and in brain sites responsible for control of emotion and the semantic reappraisal of emotion, which represents the different ways a people understand situations based on their perspectives.

According to the latest statistics from the Wine Institute, the Vatican's residents consume an average of 105 bottles of wine a year, more than the average person in any other country and more than three times the amount consumed in the UK. That's around twice the amount drunk by the average French or Italian person, and around three times that of the average Catholic in the US. The National Catholic Reporter notes that Vatican residents are more likely to be old, male, highly educated, and eat in larger groups, all factors that can contribute to greater wine consumption. The fact that it only has a population of around 800 people does make it easy for per-capita figures to be distorted by outlying groups, but in the Vatican there is reportedly a single supermarket supplying everyone with wine almost completely tax-free.","– The Vatican is home to about 800 people—and they drink a lot of wine, the Independent reports.

3567,"– Ben Carson has said health care fraud should be punished harshly, including sending offenders to prison for at least a decade and forcing them to give up ""all of one's personal possessions."" But the AP reports that the presidential candidate has maintained a business relationship with a dentist convicted of defrauding insurance companies. Pittsburgh dentist Alfonso A. Costa pleaded guilty to a felony count of healthcare fraud after an FBI probe into his oral surgery practice found he had charged for procedures he never performed. Though the crime carries a potential sentence of up to 10 years in federal prison, Costa was able to avoid prison time after Carson helped petition a federal judge for leniency. ""We became friends about a decade ago because we discovered that we were so much alike and shared the same values and principles that govern our lives,"" Carson told the judge. At Costa's 2008 sentencing hearing, Carson described the dentist as ""one my closest, if not my very closest friend."" ""Next to my wife of 32 years, there is no one on this planet that I trust more,"" he said, adding that their families vacationed together and that they were involved in ""joint projects."" In his 2013 book America the Beautiful, Carson wrote that anyone found guilty of health-care fraud should face what he called the ""Saudi Arabian Solution."" ""Why don't people steal very often in Saudi Arabia? Obviously because the punishment is the amputation of one or more fingers. I would not advocate chopping off people's limbs, but there would be some very stiff penalties for this kind of fraud,"" Carson said in 2013. But Costa was allowed to go to the judge, who said he was allowed, and the judge decided that he didn'll ""have a lot and ... they have been able to make the fact that they have ... which they have a very, which which ... which which which, which they they have which which (which, which ... ... which, and they have (which which which they will go ... which ... they will have ... ... and a very ... ... ... they they will get a very (which ... they ... they can get ... ... [and a very very ... and ... which one ... they just just just one ... and one ... ... one one ... one ... which a speech.","– Ben Carson's views on health care fraud are getting a lot of attention thanks in part to his new book, America's Health Care: How to Reform the System to Save Money and Patientsfford. But the views expressed in the book aren't exactly those of a health care expert: In one passage, Carson writes about a doctor who sold his oral surgery practice to another doctor who was accused of fraud by Medicare. The government found only two ""questionable bills"" totaling $180 in the doctor's practice. The doctor accepted a deal in which he would plead guilty to a federal offense and be sentenced to a year of house arrest and a $300,000 fine. ""This is how Medicare often operates. It chooses not to do simple claims adjudication before paying bills, so every five years or so, it makes a big public relations splash of criminally prosecuting providers who never should have been paid in the first place,"" writes Jason Zengerle at Forbes. ""Carson's gifts would be wasted by descending into the weeds of public policy and practical politics. The idea of universal HSAs Dr. Carson presented during his speech might help remedy all this but the ideas presented ... are poorly informed.""",,,

4408,"– Nestle may have taken more than 32 million gallons of water from a national forest in California last year—but it only had the right to do so for about 8.5 million gallons, according to a state investigation. The California State Water Resources Control Board found that the company didn't have the proper permits to withdraw the water from Mount Adams National Forest in the midst of a drought, the Los Angeles Times reports. Nestle claims it inherited rights to the water in the forest more than a century ago and uses it in its Arrowhead Mountain Spring Water. ""I feel like it's a victory,"" Mount Adams Supervisor Cheryl Frye tells the Desert Sun. The investigation was prompted by complaints from residents who said Nestle was depleting the forest's water supply and endangering wildlife. The US Forest Service was also sued by environmental and public interest groups who alleged the company was allowed to operate its Strawberry Canyon pipeline on a permit that expired in 1988.","– Nestle may have to stop taking millions of gallons of water from Southern California's San Bernardino National Forest after state regulators concluded it lacks valid permits, the AP reports. The State Water Resources Control Board notified the company on Wednesday that an investigation concluded it doesn't have proper rights to about three-quarters of the water it withdraws for bottling. ""A significant portion of the Water currently diverted by Nestle appears to be diverted without a valid basis of right,"" the report concluded. The board left open the possibility that Nestle could make a valid claim to extract more water from the forest land. Nestle Waters North America was urged to cut back its water withdrawals unless it can show it has valid water rights to its current sources or to additional groundwater. The company, a division of the Swiss food giant, also was given 60 days to submit an interim compliance plan. Nestle said it was pleased that the report reaffirms that it holds valid rights to ""a significant amount"" of water. ""We will continue to operate lawfully according to these existing rights and will comply fully with California law,"" Nestle added in a statement. The report also was applauded by activists who have fought to turn off Nestle's tap in the forest.",,,

All journalists watching the movie in Fox's Soho headquarters had to sign a form agreeing not to publish a review or even express a professional opinion online or in print before Monday,” writes Andrew Pulver in the Guardian. “So by saying Avatar was really much, much better than expected, that it looked amazing and that the story was gripping—if cheesy in many places—the Guardian is in technical breach of the agreement.” Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times: The movie “ packs the entertainment value and emotional punch of Titanic,” and Cameron “will most certainly be among the 10 'Best Picture' nominees for the Oscars.” Joe Morgenstern, Wall Street Journal: “There are shades of detail, and of background—the nuances of the language the native Na'vi speak; the realization of the animal inhabitants; the history of the clan—which all reinforce the impression that you get from any film that has taken 15 years to make.”","– Critics are raving about Avatar, James Cameron's first film in 15 years and the first to use 3D.

 That's a pretty healthy profit for the collector who bought the outfit decades ago for a mere $20 as it was on the verge of being tossed out.

""A docent told me not to bother to pick it up, because they were throwing it away,"" Tumblin, who once ran the hair and makeup department at Universal Studios, told the Telegraph last month. But ""I had noticed there was a printed label saying Selznick International Pictures, and 'Scarlett production dress' was written in ink,"" he said. ""I asked if he would sell it to me."" He ended up paying just $20 for the costume, worn by Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara in four scenes of the 1939 film—an incredible bargain considering the dress sold at auction on Saturday for $137,000. The outfit—really a jacket and skirt ensemble—was actually pale blue during filming. But some of the 150 Gone With the Wind pieces sold by Heritage Auctions this weekend remain in pristine condition, including a gray wool suit Clark Gable wore when he kicked down Scarlett O'Hara's boudoir door as Rhett Butler, CNN reports; it sold for $55,000. A straw hat worn by Leigh fetched $52,500, while a black bonnet donned by Leigh and Olivia de Havilland's character Melanie Wilkes sold for $30,000, Reuters reports. Tumblin seems happy to have been able to offer up his pieces, many of which have toured the country. ""I am really looking forward to walking through a museum and seeing something that I once owned,"" he said. He still maintains the largest private collection of Gone With the Wind memorabilia, which includes Leigh's Oscar.

James Tumblin, who used to work at Universal Studios, says he came across the dress while doing research at a costume company in the early 1960s. ""I saw this dress on the floor and a docent told me not to bother to pick it up, because they were throwing it away,"" he says, per the Telegraph. Tumblin asked if he could sell it and was told to keep it. He bought it for $20 after noticing a label on the back that said Selznick International Pictures and ""Scarlett production dress"" was written in ink. Other standout items included a straw hat worn by Leigh in a number of scenes in the movie and a gray wool suit worn by Clark Gable as his character, Rhett Butler. The outfit, a jacket and full skirt ensemble, was worn in several key scenes, including when Scarlett O’Hara encounters Rhett Butler and when she gets attacked in the shanty town. When Leigh wore it in the film, it was slate blue-gray. Over the years, it's faded to light gray. But that didn't deter the winning bidder at the auction. ""Gone with the Wind is in my all time top 10 films I would watch if I was stranded on a desert island with a generator,"" Tumblin says."
2011,"– It's been a half-century since Vivian and Ron Joseph finished fourth in pairs figure skating at the 1964 Innsbruck Olympics, but they've always believed they were bronze medalists—until now. The Josephs had the medals to prove it, but records from the International Olympic Committee and US Figure Skating didn't show them as such, the Chicago Tribune reports.

The West German Olympic Committee was able to get the team's medals back in 1987, and some record books at the time listed the Germans as sole silver medalists. Other records listed them as co-silver medalists with Canadians Debbi Wilkes and Guy Revell. ""This is great. But this is how many years later, and after how many books have been printed?

3692,"– The Mediterranean diet rich in fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts, olive oil, and legumes can help you live longer, according to a new study. Researchers found that middle-aged women who followed the diet had longer leukocyte telomeres, the caps on the ends of chromosomes that protect cells from damage, the New York Times reports. Shorter telomeres are associated with age-related chronic diseases. ""Based on our data, a three-point change in the adherence score is equivalent to 4.5 years of aging, a difference comparable to that between smokers and nonsmokers,"" says the lead author of the study from Harvard Medical School. Researchers aren't sure why the diet is associated with telomere length, but they suspect it has something to do with ""a potential biologic mechanism behind the well known anti-aging effects of the diet,"" according to the study. The diet was linked to lower all-cause mortality, reduced incidence of major cardiovascular disease, and greater health and wellbeing in people. ""These results reinforce our advice that eating a balanced and healthy diet can reduce your risk of developing heart disease,"" says a doctor with the British Heart Foundation.","– The Mediterranean diet rich in fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts, olive oil, and plenty of sleep may help keep you younger than your years.

Facebook quickly asked Khanna to disable the app, which was downloaded more than 85,000 times before it was disabled. The company also deactivated location sharing from desktops, which meant Facebook is now demanding Khanna take it down, reports Boston.com.

A former intelligence officer tells WorldNetDaily that the explosion has destroyed much of the installation and trapped about 240 personnel deep underground. The previously secret nuclear site has become a center for Iran’s nuclear activity because of the 2,700 centrifuges enriching uranium to the 20% level. A further enrichment to weapons grade would take only weeks, experts say. The level of enrichment has been a major concern to Israeli officials. Benjamin Netanyahu repeatedly has warned about the 20-percent enriched stockpile. Iran, to avoid alarm, had converted part of the stockpile to fuel plates for use in the Tehran Research Reactor. However, days after the recent failed talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency, Iranian officials announced the enrichment process will not stop ""for a moment.""",,,

His violent outbursts led Hooper to warn her principal, ""You don't want that child. ... I really had hoped that he'd be put in another person's room, but at that time I was the only one who could really handle the hard discipline problems."" But after five years at Brown Elementary School, Cruz changed his last name to Riojas. He would often misbehave, using dry humor to distract the teacher's lesson, throwing chairs or stabbing his classmates, and sometimes even running 7.5 miles from his home to his stepfather's house whenever he and No. 5 fought. When Cruz was 12, he had the last fight of his life with his stepfather—one in which he told the man he would beat him up when he got. Hooper lived in fear that someone would try to take her son away from her until he was 16. ""I lived in absolute total fear that there would be a knock on the door saying, 'He is not yours. We want him back. There's nothing you can do about it,"" she tells Today.","– When Cruz Riojas was in sixth grade, his teacher told her, ""If you put that Riojas kid in my class, I'm going to quit,"" she tells the San Antonio Express-News.

3485,"– More than half a million members of the Rohingya Muslim minority have fled Myanmar for Bangladesh in the past seven weeks amid reports of a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing,"" per the UN. Now a new report by the World Food Program finds that one-third of homes in one district of Rakhine State are experiencing extreme food deprivation, reports the Guardian. The WFP isn't commenting on the report, but it did say in a statement to NPR that ""the purpose of WFP in Myanmar is and always has been to address the food and nutrition needs of vulnerable people."" The report comes as the UN Security Council prepares to hold an emergency meeting on the Rohingya crisis. The AP reports that the Myanmar military has been conducting ""a campaign of rape, murder, and arson"" against the Rohingya since August after Rohingya militants attacked security outposts. The military says it's protecting citizens, but the Rohingya say they've been subjected to ""genocide,"" and the UN has called it an ""unspeakable brutality."" The new report cites ""restriction of movement"" by security forces as one of the main constraints on accessing food. Residents still did not have full access to the forest, agricultural land, and fishing grounds due to continuous military presence. More than 80,000 children under the age of 5 are ""wasting""—a potentially fatal condition that could lead to permanent weight loss. The report was removed from the website of the Myanmar government, which asked it to be taken down.","– More than half a million members of the Rohingya Muslim minority have fled Myanmar for Bangladesh in the past seven weeks amid what the UN calls a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"" by the Myanmar military and Buddhist vigilantes, NPR reports. Most are living in overcrowded, spontaneously erected camps, staying in shelters that amount to little more than bamboo poles strapped together with a bit of plastic sheeting for a roof. Bangladesh estimates about 800,000 Rohingya are now living in camps on its side of the border. The Rohingya aren't officially recognized by Myanmar, which doesn't use the word ""Rohingya,"" but the Bangladeshi government is giving them temporary IDs that can be used to access food. ""They're being given a camp residency card, which basically gives them access to food rations,"" says Maj. Kazi Obaidur Reza, with Bangladesh's border guards. ""But Bangladesh is still very far away from recognizing them formally as refugees. And that matters, because if they're not registered refugees it means that they don't have access to education. They have very limited ability to move around."" Peter Bouckaert, emergencies director for Human Rights Watch, says that if the Rohingya—who have lived in Myanmar for decades but have been denied citizenship and denied access to jobs and education because of their religion—return to their homeland, they will face ""genocide.""",,,

2882,"– The US and Russia are the only countries to have landed a probe on the moon's far side—also known as the dark side—but that could soon change. Zou Yongliao, an engineer with the Chinese Academy of Sciences' moon exploration department, told state broadcaster CCTV on Wednesday that China plans to launch its Chang'e 4 probe to the side sometime before 2020, the AP reports. Zou said the mission's objective would be to study geological conditions on the Dark Side, which could eventually lead to the placement of a radio telescope, something that would help ""fill a void"" in man's knowledge of the universe. Radio transmissions from Earth are unable to reach the dark sides of the moon, making it an excellent location for sensitive instruments. If successful, that would make China only the third country after the United States and Russia to have carried out such a maneuver, Michael Brown at Monash University in Austrailia tells Al Jazeera. ""This shouldn't be too difficult a problem to solve, given spacecraft orbiting Mars regularly relay signals from the Opportunity and Curiosity rovers that are driving around on that planet,"" he says.","– The US and Russia are the only countries to have landed a probe on the moon's far side—also known as the dark side—but that could soon change.

3717,"– ""It's like I'm on some Oregon blacklist, the Oregon #MeToo blacklist,"" says Michaela Myers, one of 34 current and former US Forest Service women who spoke to the PBS NewsHour about sexual harassment in the workplace, including groping, rape, and a ""frat-like"" atmosphere. Myers says she started working as a firefighter in Oregon last summer and was groped at a crew pizza party by her supervisor, who told her he was glad she was on the crew because she was ""sexy."" He also allegedly rubbed her butt on a couch and slid his hand. The National Women's Law Center says more than 5,600 female Forest Service employees have filed gender discrimination and harassment complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over the past five years. The center's executive director says there's a ""pervasive, deep-seated bias against women in the Forest Service"" that goes back to the early days of the agency, which was created in 1905 as an arm of the Department of Agriculture. ""The stories I hear from female firefighters really sound like they are from the 1970s,"" says Debra D'Agostino, a federal employment lawyer who has represented at least five forest service women with gender discrimination complaints.","– The head of the US Forest Service has stepped down amid an investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct, the New York Times reports. Tony Tooke sent a memo to Forest Service employees Wednesday saying he was resigning effective immediately. ""I have been forthright during the review, but I cannot combat every inaccuracy that is reported in the news media,"" he wrote. ""What I can control, however, are decisions I make today and the choice of a path for the future that is best for our employees."" The resignation comes days after PBS NewsHour reported that the Agriculture Department was investigating sexual misconduct complaints against Tooke. Some 34 women have filed complaints with the USDA's Office of Inspector General, which is investigating the Forest Service's handling of the complaints. One woman says she was sent on administrative leave for ""disruptive behavior"" after she told her squad leader, ""I can't do this.""","Michaela Myers said she was first groped by her supervisor after a crew pizza party last summer, shortly after starting a new job as a firefighter with the U.S. Forest Service. She was 22 and excited about the job. She had worked out diligently to prepare for the season, running and hiking with a heavy pack. She is from the Pacific Northwest, and had always loved the outdoors and a challenge.

Tooke's retirement, which is effective immediately, comes just a few days after a PBS NewsHour investigation into both the Forest Service and Tooke, who informed his staff he'd be leaving in a Wednesday email obtained by Politico and BuzzFeed. While Tooke didn't confirm or deny the allegations against him—allegations that the New York Times says haven't yet been spelled out—he says, ""I cannot combat every inaccuracy that is reported in the news media,"" and therefore feels it's best to ""make way for a new leader that can ensure future success for all employees and the agency."" PBS talked to 34 current and former Forest Service female workers, who described a hostile work environment that included everything from bullying and sexual harassment to groping and rape. Many women also allege retaliation after they reported these incidents. The Forest Service says its parent agency, the Department of Agriculture, has ""engaged an independent investigator"" to look into specific allegations against Tooke, who has been with the Forest Service since he was 18. Tooke wrote in his email that ""I admire the courage"" of the women who've come forward about the Forest Service and that ""each employee deserves a leader who can maintain the proper moral authority to steer the Forest Service along this important and challenging course.""

""Chief Tony Tooke has determined that it is best for the Forest Service, its future, and its employees that he step aside,"" Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement Wednesday. Tooke, who had been with the agency for several decades, was appointed to the post last summer.

That investigation also revealed claims of sexual misbehavior against Tooke. (The Forest Service has been hit with multiple wildfires this year.)"

The incident off the Louisiana coast complicated the energy industry’s effort to portray BP PLC’s massive Deepwater Horizon oil spill as a fluke that shouldn’t have provoked a drilling moratorium, some energy experts said. Mariner Energy Inc.’s shallow-water platform wasn’t covered by the moratorium, because it didn’t involve drilling and wasn't in deep water. But the towering column of smoke in the gulf, 245 miles from where the Deepwater Horizon exploded April 20, provoked an outcry from environmental groups and politicians in Washington already skeptical of offshore drilling.

2329,"– Scientists say Friday's devastating tsunami in Indonesia was caused by a ""strike-slip fault""—a type of fault that occurs when the earth's surface moves in a ""heterogeneous"" way, the New York Times reports. In this case, the earth moved in such a way that it caused the tsunami. ""We won't know what caused it until that's done,"" says Robert Patton, a seismologist at the University of California, Berkeley. He notes that the quake may have caused an undersea landslide that displaced water and created the tsunami waves. The AP reports that Indonesia was supposed to be one of the first countries to get a tsunami-warning system in place, but funding issues stalled the project. A prototype developed with $3 million from the US National Science Foundation has been stalled in the testing phase for years. It is too late for central Sulawesi, where walls of water up to 20 feet high and a magnitude 7.5 earthquake killed at least 832 people in Palu and Donggala, tragically highlighting the weaknesses of the existing warning system and low public awareness about how to respond to warnings. ""To me this is a tragedy for science, even more so a Tragedy for the Indonesian people as the residents of Sulawesi are discovering right now,"" says Louise Comfort, a University of Pittsburgh expert in disaster management.","– The earthquake that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday may have been caused by an unusual type of fault, experts say. The Guardian reports that the magnitude 7.5 quake was caused by a ""strike-slip fault,"" in which the earth movement is largely horizontal. That kind of movement would not ordinarily create a tsunami, but under certain circumstances it can. ""We won't know what caused it until that's done,"" says James Patton, a seismologist with the British Geological Survey. He says the quake may have caused an undersea landslide that pushed seawater in front of the earthquake's rupture zone, which was about 70 miles long. Another possibility is that the tsunami was created indirectly by the movement of the seafloor. ""The fact that people were still milling around Palu's shoreline when waves were visibly approaching shows the lessons of earlier disasters haven't been absorbed,"" a psychologist tells the AP. ""This points to the failing to do appropriate training and to develop trust so that people know exactly what to do when an alert is issued,"" he says. ""In our project in Bandung, we're finding a similar unwillingness to prepare for something that seems unlikely."" A high-tech early warning system that was supposed to replace an existing system set up after an earthquake and tsunami killed nearly 250,000 people in the region in 2004 has been stalled in the testing phase for years, the AP reports.

 MAKASSAR, Indonesia (AP) — An early warning system that might have prevented some deaths in the tsunami that hit an Indonesian island on Friday has been stalled in the testing phase for years. 
 
 The high-tech system of seafloor sensors, data-laden sound waves and fiber-optic cable...","– The tsunami that killed hundreds, possibly thousands of people after an earthquake in Indonesia on Friday was much bigger and more devastating than would normally be expected after that kind of quake, scientists say. ""We expected it might cause a tsunami, just not one that big,"" geophysicist Jason Patton tells the New York Times. Tsunamis like the 18-foot monster wave that wrecked cities on Sulawesi island are usually caused by ""megathrust"" earthquakes that move land vertically, not ""strike-slip"" quakes like the 7.5-magnitude one Friday, which moved the earth horizontally, Patton says. The Sulawesi event was, however, localized, unlike the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. It may have been the case, Patton says, that massive undersea landslides created the tsunami, or that the narrow bay that Palu sits at the end of concentrated the wave's power. Indonesian authorities have been strongly criticized for apparently canceling the tsunami alert too early, though expert Adam Switzer at the Earth Observatory of Singapore tells the AP that this is unfair. ""What it shows is that the tsunami models we have now are too simplistic,"" he says. ""They don't take into account multiple events, multiple quakes within a short period of time. They don't take into account submarine landslides."" The official death toll now stands at 844, though authorities, who have been preparing mass graves, have been unable to access some hard-hit areas, the Guardian reports.","– Scientists are trying to figure out what caused Indonesia's second-largest city, Palu, to be pummeled by a tsunami Friday, and they're not sure what caused it at all. ""We won't know what caused [it] until that's done,"" a University of California-Santa Barbara seismologist tells the New York Times. One possibility is that the tsunami was caused by an undersea landslide. Such a landslide would have displaced water and created waves, and the earthquake may have caused the rupture zone of the fault to move through an area where the seafloor rises or drops off, pushing seawater in front of it. Other possibilities are that the quake itself caused the tsunami, or that it was triggered by an earthquake-induced rupture on a strike-slip fault, reports the BBC. The death toll in Palu—which is located on the island of Java—now stands at more than 3,300, with more than 61,000 people injured, per the AP. In the wake of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami that killed more than a quarter-million people in Indonesia, the country promised to have a tsunami-detection system up and running by the end of this year. But the system has been ""simply put on hold"" since September, when the country's finance ministry, its geophysics agency, and a private company failed to come to an agreement on who should bear the brunt of the system's data. The project's final undersea point, off the coast of Padang, is just a few kilometers away."

One Midwest GOP lawmaker told the Hill, “I’ll sign it ... and others will sign it, if the president agrees to sign the bill.” The Senate bill has cleared two procedural hurdles and is expected to pass soon.","– House Democrats have enough signatures to force a floor vote on a bipartisan bill calling for China to let its currency rise in value against the US dollar. They need 218 to do so, but Republicans have warned them against signing. “I’ll sign it ... and others will sign it, if the president agrees to sign the bill,” says one Midwest GOP lawmaker, according to the Hill. John Boehner has called the bill ""dangerous,"" but 99 House Republicans voted for such a bill last year in the Democratic-controlled House. Boehner has the option of moving the bill that's different from the Senate version, putting the onus on the White House to negotiate a deal. But even if he does move the bill, it's highly unlikely he'd get it through the House, given the GOP's opposition to legislation that could hurt the economy.

420,"– If you've ever wondered what it's like to be tracked at Disney World, you're in luck. The Walt Disney Co. has announced that it will start using facial recognition technology to track ""every move"" made by guests at Disney parks, including Epcot, Disney World's Animal Kingdom, and Disney World in Florida, the Wall Street Journal reports. The technology, which will be rolled out over the next few months, will allow Disney to determine the age and gender of each guest who walks into one of the parks, as well as whether they've eaten at a Disney restaurant, ridden a Disney ride, or visited a Disney attraction. Disney says the technology will also be used to determine if a guest has changed clothes or taken off an item of clothing during the day. The company says the facial recognition system will be cheaper and easier to use than clothing recognition, which can be expensive and inaccurate if guests are wearing sunglasses or hats, the New York Daily News reports. In a blog post, Disney says that while facial recognition systems ""require cameras that are visible to the person,"" clothing recognition will be more reliable because ""many guests have similar attire, and will change their clothing throughout the day, such as putting on or taking off a jacket or sweater."" Disney has been granted a patent for a system and method ""using foot recognition to create a customized guest experience,"" WFTV reports.","– Starting this summer, Disney visitors will be able to register for rides and other attractions using their shoes. In a blog post, the company explains that the technology allows Disney to "" tailor certain experiences for the guest."" For example, a person's shoes may vary widely in appearance and color, as well as lower leg data, tread wear, and foot size. Disney says the system can also use additional information, such as a guest's height, weight, and shoe size. The blog post notes that Disney has rejected other technologies that could be used to track guests, including retinal and fingerprint scanning, which Disney says are ""invasive, obtrusive, and inaccurate if guests are wearing certain accessories such as sunglasses or hats."" Disney says it has no plans to use clothing recognition, as ""those systems require cameras that are visible to the person.""

535,"– Scientists think they've figured out what caused the biggest eruption in Yellowstone National Park's history, a 631,000-year-old supereruption that sent vast amounts of rock, dust, and volcanic ash over parts of the US and Canada. ""If something like this happened today, it would be catastrophic,"" Arizona State University geologist Hannah Shamloo tells National Geographic. ""We want to understand what triggers these eruptions, so we can set up warning systems. That's the big-picture goal."" Shamloo and her team discovered crystals of feldspar embedded in a rock formation known as the Lava Creek Tuff outside the park. These crystals, called phenocrysts, form as magma cools slowly beneath the volcano. They were too large to have formed when hot material was flung up during the eruption, but grew gradually in Yellowstone's magma chamber. As the surrounding temperature, pressure, and water content changed, trace elements surrounding the crystals also changed and became incorporated into subsequent layers. ""There are multiple ways to trigger an eruption,"" Shamloo says, ""but as of now, we're seeing evidence for a magma injection."" The team presented their findings at the American Geophysical Union's Fall Meeting in San Francisco on Dec. 13.","– ""It's shocking how little time is required to take a volcanic system from being quiet and sitting there to the edge of an eruption."" That's Hannah Shamloo's take on the last super-eruption at Yellowstone National Park, which happened 631,000 years ago—and it's one that scientists have yet to fully understand. ""We want to understand what triggers these eruptions, so we can set up warning systems,"" Shamloo, a geologist at Arizona State University, tells the New York Times. ""That's the big-picture goal."" To that end, Shamloo and a colleague presented evidence at the IAVCEI 2017 conference in Portland, Ore., this month that such eruptions only need a few decades of gestation before exploding. To study this, the researchers examined two types of crystals known as phenocrysts, which form when magma cools under a volcano. Varying between 1 and 2 millimeters each, these crystals are too large to have formed during the heat of an explosion. Instead, they grew gradually over time in Yellowstone's magma chamber, each crystal beginning with a core that slowly and steadily enlarged outward, layer upon layer. As surrounding magma conditions changed, trace elements surrounding the growing pheno crysts were recorded. The researchers believe the magma chamber had the same bulk composition as the one that erupted the Lava Creek Tuff, but the water content was much lower: 5% water by weight, 5 times that of an older eruption from the Long Valley Caldera that produced the Bishop Tuff. ""There are multiple ways to trigger an eruption, but as of now, we're seeing evidence for a magma injection,"" says Shamloo.",,,

 In a news conference, Cocoa Police Chief Michael Cantaloupe did not describe the ...","– Despite reports Thursday that they wouldn't be charged with a crime, the five teens who allegedly laughed and filmed a man as he drowned in Florida earlier this month could now face misdemeanor charges. ABC News reports police have recommended charges for ""duty to report"" against the unnamed teens, who range in age from 14 to 16. News 13 explains that while Florida doesn't have a law requiring bystanders to report someone dying, it does have a law that requires people to report someone has died. Jamel Dunn, 31, drowned earlier this month. Cocoa Police Chief Mike Cantaloupe says it's the first time the law would be used in this manner, and the teens would serve as a ""test case."" News 13 reports the statute is most typically applied to medical examiners. The State Attorney's Office worked with police to come up with the charges, but the office will determine whether to prosecute the case. Cantaloupe previously called the teens' actions ""utterly inhumane and cruel.""","– Police in Cocoa, Fla., say they'll file charges against five teens who laughed and filmed as a homeless man drowned in a pond earlier this month. Jamel Dunn's body was found July 7 at the edge of the pond, and police said Thursday that no charges would be filed because the teens didn't report his death, the Orlando Sentinel reports. But on Friday, Cocoa Police Chief Michael Cantaloupe said charges will be filed under a Florida law that requires people to report deaths. ""It is the duty of any person in the district where a death occurs, who becomes aware of the death of any individual occurring ... must report such death and circumstances to the district medical examiner,"" the law states, per WESH. ""As far as we know, the statute has never been used in this way,"" Cantaloupes said, adding it's possible Dunn would still be alive today if one of the teens had called for help. The teens, who are between the ages of 14 and 17, are being investigated by the State Attorney's Office, which will decide whether to prosecute. ""We can find no moral justification for either the behavior of persons heard on the recording of the deliberate decision not to render aid to Mr. Dunn,"" it says in a statement. Dunn was determined to have entered the pond on his own after video from a neighbor's security camera showed him scaling a fence and entering the pond. ""This is an isolated act of unspeakable inhumanity and in no way is a reflection of our community,"" says Cocoa Mayor Henry Parrish III."
1222,"– President Obama and a Tea Party activist had a heated back-and-forth at the end of a town hall meeting in Iowa today. Ryan Rhodes, the founder of the Iowa Tea Party, demanded to know whether Vice President Biden had called Tea Partiers ""terrorists"" during the debt ceiling debate. Obama didn't directly answer the question in public, but he fired back that he knows better than anyone what it's like to be slammed for his political views, reports Fox News. “As someone who’s been called a socialist, not born here, taking away freedoms for providing health care, I’m all for lowering the rhetoric,” he said. Obama said he would discuss the matter further with Rhodes. “He just denied it, he said the Vice President didn’t make any of those assertions,” Rhodes told Fox News later. “If he doesn’t want to even admit what was on TV nationally—all over the place—then how can you have a conversation?”","– President Obama's deputy chief of staff is standing by his claim that the president called him a ""terrorist"" at the height of the debt ceiling debate. Ben Rhodes tells the Daily Beast that Obama ""then said, 'We can't have a conversation because you're saying I called you a terrorist,'"" he says. ""I said my piece. The fact is it demonstrates the deep divide that [Obama] is unwilling to negotiate without going after the other side."" Rhodes was heckled at a town hall event in Iowa last night by angry constituents who accused him of being ""extraordinarily rude,"" reports the Huffington Post. ""That was extraordinarily rude,"" one woman said. ""Over the top aggressive.""",,,

Then last year, she suffered an allergic reaction to the bee venom and died. According to a report published in the Journal of Investigational Allergology and Clinical Immunology, the woman ""developed wheezing, dyspnea, and sudden loss of consciousness immediately after a live bee sting."" Doctors say she suffered a ""massive watershed stroke and permanent coma"" due to severe anaphylactic shock. The death is believed to be the first reported death from the bee acupuncture treatment. Live bee acupuncture—also known as bee venom apitherapy—is a treatment in which a patient is stung by an angry bee and treated by a bee-stinging needle. The acupuncture can be dangerous for people with severe allergies. In the case of the Spanish woman, doctors say repeated exposure to the allergen increases the risk of a severe reaction.

""The single most effective defense against nuclear terrorism is fully securing this material so it doesn't fall into the wrong hands in the hands of terrorists."" Obama said the necessary 102 countries have ratified an amendment to a nuclear security treaty, but not all of the world's 2,000 tons of nuclear material is ""properly secured,"" reports Reuters.

More than 50 countries were represented at the summit, but only Russia and the US, which hold 90% and 90% of the global's nuclear weapons, respectively, were in attendance, the New York Times reports. The president of the Ploughshares Fund, a global security foundation, writes in a column for the Huffington Post that the summits aren't moving fast enough. ""When fleeing a forest fire, direction is—President Obama has weighed in on Donald Trump's suggestion that Japan and South Korea get their own nuclear weapons,"" he told reporters at the G20 summit in Brisbane, Australia, per the BBC.

We have to build on our progress.""

2033,"– A well-regarded emergency room doctor at New York's Mount Sinai Hospital has been suspended amid allegations that he sexually abused two female patients. Dr. David Newman surrendered to police yesterday on charges that he ejaculated on a 22-year-old patient knocked out by a shot of morphine he delivered personally in the hospital emergency room, CBS New York reports. The Iraq War veteran is also accused of groping a second woman's face after incapacitating her with morphine injections, the New York Daily News reports.

Several people were injured. The officers fired the rubber bullets while trying to clear protesters who were trying to prevent National Police cars from leaving after police confiscated ballot boxes from the voting center. The Spanish government has ordered police to stop the voting process, saying it's illegal. Catalan officials said 38 people were treated for mostly minor injuries, the AP reports.

""Police brutality will shame forever the Spanish state,"" he said as crowds cheered. Tension has been on the rise since the vote was called in early September, crystalizing years of defiance by separatists in the affluent region, which contributes mightily to Spain's economy. Separatist Catalans have long complained of contributing too much to the state while not getting enough in return. Enric Millo, the Spanish government's representative in the region, said police and National Guard forces acted ""professionally"" to enforce court orders. The regional government said Monday that the vote would be allowed to go ahead even though the official electoral board has been disbanded.

In fact, they developed them as early as 320,000 years ago, reports NPR, making them ""the earliest ever documented Middle Stone Age in the whole continent."" The discovery in Olorgesailie, in southern Kenya, is ""the only record of the last million years in Africa,"" says Marta Mirazon Lahr of George Washington University, who wasn't involved in the new research published Thursday in Science.

This shows that people were aware of other groups and exchanging raw materials long before the arrival of modern humans.

Smithsonian reports that five archaeological sites in the Olorgesailie Basin date back 300,000 years to the Middle Stone Age, suggesting humans were able to move further away from Africa and into the Old World than previously thought. The earliest modern humans were believed to have arrived in Africa 100,000 years ago, according to Science. The new research, published in the journal Science, suggests the earliest humans in Africa weren't arriving until about 500,000 years ago. Researchers say they've found glass and ochre tools that are at least 800,000 years older than those of modern humans, and they believe they're the first evidence of long-distance transport of raw materials in Africa. The findings suggest that early humans needed to adapt to climate change, which would have made it difficult for them to find food in the next few hundred thousand years. ""The crux of these papers is that hominin populations did not disappear—so at least some of them must have adapted technologically and culturally, with the environment driving greater mobility, information gathering, and sharing, and innovation,"" the lead researcher says in a press release.

4658,"– Former FBI agent John Connolly could be released from prison as soon as today after a Florida appeals court overturned his murder conviction. The three-judge panel ruled 2-1 that the statute of limitations has expired in the case of Connolly, who was convicted of second-degree murder with a firearm in 2008 in connection with the 1982 shooting death of Boston businessman John Callahan. According to the Boston Globe, Connolly was the FBI agent who ratted out James ""Whitey"" Bulger and Stephen ""The Rifleman"" Flemmi for murders they were allegedly involved in. He was sentenced to 40 years in prison in 2009 after being found guilty of tipping off Bulger's henchmen, Martorano, that a World Jai Alai executive was going to be killed. But the appeals court found that the time passed after Callahan's murder before Connolly was charged with a crime was too long. “It was undisputed that [Martorano] used his own gun to shoot Callahan and that Connolly never carried, displayed, used, or threatened to use the murder weapon,” Judge Richard J. Suarez wrote for the majority. “Mr. Connolly presently is right where he belongs, and I guess we’ll do what we can to keep him there.”","– Former FBI agent John J.

 ""The Canadian Special Operations Command can confirm that a member of Joint Task Force 2 successfully hit a targe...","– An amazing, if grisly, feat continues to resonate after a report in Thursday's Globe and Mail of Toronto. The newspaper, quoting military sources, says a Canadian sniper in Iraq killed an ISIS militant from the mind-boggling distance of 3,540 meters, or 2.2 miles. The Canadian military has not confirmed what would be the longest kill shot by a sniper in history, but the story has in the meantime drawn attention to something else: the remarkable prowess of Canadian snipers in general. Some coverage: The training: If confirmed, that means the sniper record has been broken four times in the last 15 years, three of those times by Canadians, notes Maclean's magazine. One reason, it says, is because Canadian snipers ""are not simply taught to hit their targets."" The training goes beyond their shooting duties, making sure they're able to ""design and run complex operations"" if necessary. ""That in itself may not make them better snipers but the gestalt of sniper-training and command-thinking combined could explain their skill."" Long history: The CBC examines the history of Canada's military marksmanship, noting that Cpl. Francis Pegahmagabow of the 1st Canadian Infantry Battalion had 378 kills, making him deadliest sniper of World War I. A military historian says the skill carried into WWII. ""The best snipers were usually country boys who knew how to hunt."" Official statement: The Canadian military has not confirmed the kill, but it did confirm the shot. ""A member of the Joint Task Force 2 successfully hit a target from 3,540 meters,"" it says in an email to NPR, adding that it won't divulge further details for troop safety. Really? The Globe and Mail says the shot was verified by video and data, but that hasn't emerged yet, and some are skeptical. The Washington Post talks to former US snipers who say that even seeing a human target would be difficult from that distance, even with advanced scopes. A theory floated by a former Marine shooter: ""A spotter with an advanced optical device was able to verbally walk the sniper onto the target and correct his aim.” Yes: Canadian Cpl. Rob Furlong, who once held the record himself at 2,430 meters, counters the skeptics: “It’s not an impossible distance,” he says. “So to the naysayers I would just say, this can be done.” It's a ""hell of a shot,"" adds former Canadian sniper Jody Mitic, who was written a book called, of course, Unflinching: The Making of a Canadian Sniper. A critic: In a post at Stuff.co.nz, John Edens thinks the shot was possible, given high-tech gizmos to account for everything from wind speed to the curvature of the earth. Plus, the gun used, a McMillan TAC-50 rifle, employs a 50-caliber bullet the size of a ""large cigar."" His beef, though, is with media coverage that he thinks glorifies war. ""It's an achievement to a point, but it's not really one humanity should be proud of.""","– The US military's longest-ever confirmed sniper kill occurred in 2004, when Sgt. Bryan Kremer killed an Iraqi insurgent with his Barrett M82A1 rifle at more than 2,300 feet.

Another complained that the ""small collection of etchings and engravings on whale teeth and bone"" was ""quite explicit.""","– A small collection of etchings and engravings on whale teeth and bone is on display at the Vancouver Maritime Museum, part of a larger show that also features example of maritime tattoo art. Nine of the etched pieces on display show images of a sexual nature, some of them quite explicit. The VMM has collected scrimshaw for years—most of the work was donated—but the pieces were rarely if ever displayed. Museum curator Patricia Owen says the opportunity arose when staff decided to present a show about maritime tattoos; it seemed natural to compare and contrast the two art forms. But the nine pieces with sexual content are displayed in a case raised high off the floor, well beyond scope of a toddler's inquisitive eyes, and lighting is prudishly dim. Next to the display is a sign: ""Hide Your Eyes! These pieces of scrimshaw are not intended for children."" Ann Pimentel raised the concern—and coined the unlikely phrase—after visiting the museum, the Vancouver Sun reports. She says she was ""extremely disturbed"" and ""concerned for unknowing families and school groups especially with children that are impressionable and vulnerable. I will not be returning nor recommending this Museum.""",,,
1964,"– Critics are giving War for the Planet of the Apes a 95% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, calling it ""a stirring, soulful conclusion to a trilogy that has brilliantly evolved from its original source, claiming the admittedly not-very-competitive crown as the summer's best sequel.""

1423,"– The assassination of Ahmed Wali Karzai, the powerful half-brother of Afghan President Hamid Karzai, has set off a wave of speculation about who will succeed him—and it's not clear whether either of his sons will be able to take over. The elder Karzai was a powerful provincial council chairman in Afghanistan's Kandahar province and had close ties to the White House. But he was also accused by the CIA of being a money-man who funneled millions of dollars into his family's businesses, and by US and NATO forces of being deeply involved in drug trafficking and gun running in the region, reports the New York Times. Karzai was exactly the kind of local ""big man""—he was a major player in the southern province of Kandahar, which has seen heavy fighting and a big US push—which the US mission both relied on and worked against. ""Despite the best efforts of the US and its allies, Walmarti Karzai was still the man to see to get things done in southern Afghanistan,"" writes Max Fisher in the Wall Street Journal. ""There will be no favor-seeking queue outside the governor's office goes up and the Queue outside the provincial council's offices goes down.""","– The assassination of Ahmed Wali Karzai, the powerful half-brother of Afghan President Hamid Karzai, is both major news for the Afghan war and barely news at all, writes Max Fisher in the Wall Street Journal. Karzai was accused of corruption and alienated the American military, but his connections and ruthlessness made him a critical force in volatile southern Afghanistan. His death is a reminder of the complicated web of loyalties, interests, and contradictions that the US has attempted to navigate for nearly a decade. ""Even in death, he is a contradiction,"" Fisher writes. ""His power, inextricably linked with his corruption, came from a self-interested, unaccountable Afghan political system that enrages many Afghans and leaves them feeling disconnected from their government. He was part of a system that fueled the war, and he helped us navigate that system while simultaneously worsening it."" Karzai was exactly the kind of local ""big man""—he was a major player in the southern province of Kandahar, which has seen heavy fighting and a big US push—which the US mission both relied on and worked against.

4864,"– Investigators who used an online genealogical site to find the ex-cop they believe is a serial killer and rapist who terrified California decades ago may have made a mistake. Paul Holes, a retired Contra Costa County DA who helped lead the investigation, tells the AP that he used the open-source site GEDmatch to find relatives of suspected Golden State Killer Joseph James DeAngelo. He says the site returned a list of relatives—with names and emails—by degree of shared single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs, which offer a genetic fingerprint. On average, you share 50% of your SNPs with a sibling, 25% with a half sibling, 12.5% with a first cousin, and 3.1% with a second cousin. The hits on DeAngelo came from third and fourth cousins, Holes says. ""I'm not familiar with any other case used to capture someone like this,"" says Holes, who built more than 25 family trees using data from the site. The site's operator says he was unaware GEDmatch was used in the search for the East Area Rapist, the Sacramento Bee reports. ""Although we were not approached by law enforcement or anyone else about this case or about the DNA, it has always been GEDmatch's policy to inform users that the database could be used for other,"" he says. Police sources tell the Los Angeles Times that DeAngelo, 72, was living close to where the murders and rapes took place in the 1970s and '80s.","– The ex-policeman suspected of being the Golden State Killer shared his DNA profile with a genealogical website, law enforcement sources tell the Los Angeles Times. The sources say Joseph James DeAngelo, 72, was living close to where the murders and rapes took place in the 1970s and '80s. The DNA found at the crime scene led investigators to a distant relative of DeAngelo who had shared his genetic profile on GEDmatch, the sources say. Paul Holes, the retired Contra Costa County DA who helped lead the investigation, tells the AP that he used his own DNA profile from Ancestry.com to learn how to use GEDmatch.

Experts say GEDmatch is a good example of the potential danger of using genetic information for law enforcement purposes without proper safeguards. ""Even though it is easy to think of this technology as something that is used just to track down serial killers, if we allow the government to use it with no accountability or no further safeguards, then all of our genetic information might be at risk for being used for things we don't want it to be used for,"" UC Berkeley law professor Katherine Roth tells the Times.

2364,"– The Harvard professor who's been leading the charge against the so-called ""Gospel of Jesus' Wife"" isn't giving up. In a new edition of the Harvard Theological Review, she writes that new scientific tests haven't turned up evidence of a modern forgery. But she still thinks the Coptic fragment, which refers to Jesus being married, is an authentic document. ""I’m basically hoping that we can move past the issue of forgery to questions about the significance of this fragment for the history of Christianity, for thinking about questions like, ‘Why does Jesus beingmarried, or not, even matter? Why is it that people had such an incredible reaction to this?'"" Harvard professor Karen King, who translated the papyrus, tells the Boston Globe. The carbon dating test dates the fragment to eighth-century Egypt, 400 years later than previously thought; the ink's chemical composition is consistent with ancient Egyptians' carbon-based inks; and microscopic imaging revealed no sign of ink pooling, which could have offered evidence that the ink was applied in modern times. King says she's not ready to give up on the fragment. ""Nothing is going to change my mind,"" she says.","– Columbia University researchers say they've found what could be the world's oldest known forgery—a fragment of a Coptic papyrus dating to AD800. The so-called ""Granny's Revenge"" was written on a piece of parchment that's about the size of a sesame seed. It was discovered in Columbia's collection of 40,000 ancient papyrus fragments, and researchers say it's ""virtually like every other papyrus manuscript we've looked at."" The Granny was likely written by someone who lived in what is now Lebanon around AD800, around the time of the Battle of Thermopylae, according to a university press release. Researchers say the Granny, whose ink is similar to that found in most ancient papyrus manuscripts, is likely the work of an Egyptian nobleman who was killed in a battle with a group of monks. ""It's a very significant find because it is the first known example of a well-written, well-documented forgery,"" the lead researcher tells the New York Times. Harvard professor Karen King, who has been leading the charge against the ""Gospel of Jesus' Wife,"" isn't giving up on the fragment.

 The findings support the argument of Harvard professor Kare...","– To call it controversial is putting it mildly: Harvard professor Karen L. King in September 2012 debuted an ancient papyrus now known as the ""Gospel of Jesus' Wife"" at a conference in Rome. The papyrus makes an explicit reference to the woman's existence with the line, ""Jesus said to them, 'My wife...'"" Now, extensive testing by professors from Columbia, Harvard, and MIT in the fields of electrical engineering, chemistry, and biology has found no indications that it is a modern forgery, per an article by King published today in the Harvard Theological Review. The Boston Globe says it most likely dates to eighth-century Egypt, and the chemical composition of its ink is in line with the carbon-based inks the people of that country used at the time. But the Globe cautions that a master forger could have accessed the proper materials, and that traditional ink-dating methods couldn't be used because the papyrus is so small: a fragment roughly 1.5-by-3 inches in size bearing just eight incomplete lines (translation here). The Review also published a rebuttal by Brown Egyptology professor Leo Depuydt, who points to ""gross grammatical errors"" he says no native speaker of Coptic would make, the New York Times reports. (More criticism of the papyrus here.) The new findings certainly don't prove that Jesus was married, a point that King has never challenged; she'd like to see the debate shift to discussions of the document's significance, and ""questions like, 'Why does Jesus being married, or not, even matter?'"" King was in 2011 asked to review the fragment at the request of its anonymous owner, who says he bought it more than a decade earlier from a collector who said he purchased it, along with five others, in East Germany in the '60s.","– The so-called ""Gospel of Jesus' Wife"" isn't a forgery after all, Harvard professor Karen King writes in the Harvard Theological Review. ""I don't buy the argument that this is sophisticated. I think it could be done in an afternoon by an undergraduate student,"" she tells the Boston Globe. King's argument is that the eight-line fragment appears to have been copied from a much earlier Greek text, perhaps composed in the second century, and that the forger may have ""wanted to put his or her own spin on modern theological issues,"" such as the role of women and celibacy in Christianity. King pored over the original carbon-dating and ink testing done on the ancient papyrus and concluded that ""such a combination of bumbling and sophistication seems extremely unlikely. I haven’t seen any argument that I find at all compelling that would indicate that it’s not genuine,"" says the director of New York University's Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, one of the world's top papyrologists. King introduced her finding in Rome 18 months ago. Her paper is being published today."

4795,"– The first study to show that insects have the ability to learn and pass on knowledge has been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and it's being hailed as a ""landmark"" example of how science can apply social science to real-world problems. Researchers trained three groups of bees—two pre-trained, and two not-pre-trained—to pull strings from an artificial flower placed under a table. The bees were then shown clips of them pulling the strings, which they'd earned by foraging for the flower. Researchers found that bees who had already learned to pull the strings were more likely to continue. In one experiment, they spent 10 minutes looking for a blue flower with a string attached and were able to pull it off in five minutes. In another, they had observers watch as they pulled the flower— Bees don't just figure out where to find food—they're able to figure out how to find it. The study's lead author, a professor of entomology, explains to the New York Times that the blue flower is a ""window into the world of bees,"" allowing the bees to see what's around them and what they need to do to get the reward. To test this, researchers had bees in two—one with more—and watched as other bees in the same colony pulled the string in different ways. When paired with their peers, the trained bees took 2.5 times longer topull the string. ""cultural transmission does not require the high cognitive sophistication specific to humans, nor is a distinctive feature of humans,"" the study author tells the Washington Post.","– For years, cognitive scientist Lars Chittka has been pestering his colleagues at Queen Mary University of London for answers to a nagging question: Could we get our small-brained bees to solve tasks that would impress a bird cognition researcher? Well, they've finally succeeded. In a series of experiments, the researchers found that bumble bees can not only learn to pull a string to retrieve a reward, but they can also learn this trick from other bees, even though they have no experience with such a task in nature. The study ""successfully challenges the notion that 'big brains' are necessary' for new skills to,"" the researchers write in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. To train 15 bumblebees to pull strings from a blue flower using their legs, researchers trained three bees in a group of three to pull an artificial flower from under a Plexiglas table with a solution that would reward them with a reward of their own. The bees then went out to forage for the flower, and when they came back to the hive, they were given the same reward and asked to pull the string. The problem is that the bees didn't get a clear sense of where the string was coming from until they pulled it back, reports the Los Angeles Times. The takeaway?

Just a week ago, Emirates led the competition 8-1 and needed just one more win to take the cup. But the Americans ran off a long string of victories, and even though Emirates had a slight edge in today's race, they managed to pull ahead by a small margin at the start and then hold off the Kiwis down the stretch. Oracle owner Larry Ellison skipped an Oracle conference to celebrate with his crew, and New Zealand Prime Minister John Key was less than impressed. ""It was Ellison's vision that helped bring these catamarans to the competition, providing great entertainment that will surely be a boon to the sport,"" he said, according to USA Today."

2850,"– Those with at least one copy of the APOE gene are twice as likely to develop age-related macular degeneration, which is a leading cause of vision loss in older people, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Researchers looked at the health histories of more than 5,600 people around the world, the New York Times reports. They found that those with one, two, or three copies of the gene, known as e2, e3, or e4, were twice as prone to develop macular degeneration than those with only one or two copies. They also had higher levels of cholesterol and other fatty materials in their blood, which can lead to the formation of yellow skin growths called xanthomas. ""Our study shows for the first time that there is a direct relationship between APOE genetic variants and an increased risk of macular degeneration,"" the study's lead author says in a press release. ""Further research is needed to clarify what role, if any, ApoE gene variants play in the development of age- related macular degeneration.""

The researchers say their study is the first to show a link between the gene and macular degeneration.","Variants of apolipoprotein E have been studied extensively as risk factors for many different conditions. For example, APOE alleles have been shown to influence the risk of cardiovascular diseases. People who carry at least one copy of the APOE e4 allele have an increased chance of developing atherosclerosis, which is an accumulation of fatty deposits and scar-like tissue in the lining of the arteries. This progressive narrowing of the arteries increases the risk of heart attack and stroke. 
 
 ...","– You have one of six possible variations of the APOE gene, having inherited one variant—e2, e3, or e4—from each parent. Reporting in the journal Neuron, University of Hawaii researchers found that the brain development of children as young as preschool age with two copies of e4 or one of e4 and one of e2 seem most adversely affected—an intriguing find in light of previous research that has linked the e4 variant to Alzheimer's. Researchers scanned the brains of 1,187 healthy people between the ages of 3 and 20 and found, for instance, that the size of the hippocampus tends to be smaller in those with the e2/e4 combination. They also found some kids with e4 didn't perform as well on tests of memory, though they caught up with their peers by age 10, reports HealthDay News. And while brain researcher Rebecca Knickmeyer, who didn't participate in the study but wrote an accompanying editorial, says the variants aren't necessarily predictive and people shouldn't start testing their kids, the research suggests that Alzheimer's may in fact be a developmental disorder, not strictly an aging one, reports the Los Angeles Times. That raises the possibility that adjustments to ""diet or cognitive training"" early on could change someone's ""trajectory,"" per Knickmeyer. Three in four people have at least one copy of e3, which seems to offer a protective effect. About 14% of people have an e4 variant, which has been linked with an elevated risk of Alzheimer's, but Knickmeyer points out that there are many Alzheimer's patients without e4, and many with e4 who never develop Alzheimer's. (Some research suggests that memories lost to Alzheimer's are actually retrievable.)","– Good news for those who suffer from Alzheimer's: A new study suggests that people with certain genetic variants are less likely to develop the disease, the New York Times reports. The study out of the University of California, San Francisco, found that people who had at least one copy of a gene variant known as APOE (e4, e3, or e4) were about half as likely to be diagnosed with the disease as people with at least two copies of the gene variant e2. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, didn't look at a cause-and-effect relationship, but a researcher tells the Times that the findings suggest that ""people with these variants may be at higher risk for Alzheimer’s because they have more of the disease-related plaques and tangles in their brains.""

300,"– Antonin Scalia has been found dead at a West Texas ranch, the AP reports. The Supreme Court justice was a guest at Cibolo Creek Ranch, a 30,000-acre resort south of Marfa. The 79-year-old Scalia arrived at the ranch Friday night for a private party with about 40 people, a US Marshals Service spokeswoman says. He left the party and retired to bed earlier than others. When he failed to appear at breakfast, a person involved with the ranch went to his room, where he discovered his body. A priest was called to administer last rites. A government source tells CNN that Scalia told friends he was feeling ill Friday night, and the group he was with left without him Saturday morning. Someone at the Ranch went in to check on him and found him unresponsive. The cause of death hasn't been revealed, but Scalia is said to have suffered a heart attack and died peacefully. The news—which comes as the court is hearing arguments this week on gay marriage, affirmative action, and affirmative action for the first time in nearly a decade—is being met with tributes from across the political spectrum. Scalia was ""incredibly disarming and charming in his own way,"" says USA Today reporter Joan Biskupic, who wrote a biography.","– Antonin Scalia has been found dead in his room at a West Texas ranch, the AP reports.

""This is a really big deal,"" study author Kenneth Langa of the University of Michigan tells the New York Times. ""It's the first time we've seen a decline of this magnitude."" The steepest drop was among people with a BMI of 30 or more, which is associated with a higher risk of dementia. The percentage of people 65 and older with a high school diploma or more jumped from 55% in 1990 to 80% in 2010, while the percentage of those with a college degree jumped from 12% to 23%, reports NBC News.

A new study out of the University of Michigan looked at the health records of more than 54,000 people over the age of 75 in the US and found that, overall, those who were healthy at the start of the study were more than twice as likely to have dementia by 2050 as those who weren't. The researchers theorize that the decline is due to better treatment of diabetes, as well as a decline in heart attacks and stroke, which are now the leading causes of dementia.

Michael Cohen, citing government raids on his home and offices, filed papers saying he plans to plead the Fifth in connection with the civil lawsuit ""due to the ongoing criminal investigation by the FBI and US Attorney for the Southern District of New York,"" CNN reports. Daniels is suing Cohen for defamation for accusing her of lying about her alleged affair with Trump, reports the Hill. She is also seeking to void a deal in which Cohen paid her $130,000 to stay quiet about the alleged affair. Michael Avenatti, Daniels' attorney, says the move is especially stunning because Cohen was Trump's ""fixer"" for more than a decade. ""Never before in our nation’s history has the attorney for the sitting President invoked the 5th Amend in connection with issues surrounding the President,"" he tweeted. He also tweeted a link to a Washington Post story that noted Trump slammed Hillary Clinton staffers in 2016 for invoking the Fifth during the investigation of her email server—but invoked the amendment himself during his 1990 divorce from Ivana Trump, dodging no fewer than 97 deposition questions, mostly about other women. (Avenatti has filed a motion to depose Trump.)","– ""Never before in our nation's history has the attorney for the sitting President invoked the 5th Amend in relation with issues surrounding the President. It is esp. stunning seeing as MC served as the 'fixer' for Mr. Trump for over 10 yrs,"" tweeted Stormy Daniels' attorney Wednesday, referring to President Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. In a court filing, Cohen said he would plead the Fifth in the porn star's defamation lawsuit against him because of an FBI raid on his office, the Hill reports. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, is suing Cohen for defamation over his suggestion that Daniels lied about her alleged affair with Trump. Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 as part of a nondisclosure agreement weeks before the election that, Daniels says, was meant to silence her about the reported affair. The judge in that case said last week that he needed to hear from Cohen directly before deciding on that request. CNN reports the filing was made in an effort to have the civil lawsuit filed by Daniels put on hold. Daniels is suing the president over a $130,000 payment she says she was paid to keep quiet about an alleged affair. Cohen says the Fifth Amendment protects him from ""self-incrimination regarding his involvement in a hush money deal"" involving Daniels and Trump."

The first daughter says she will donate profits from her upcoming book, Women Who Work, to charities that focus on women in the workforce, as well as to a trust controlled by her husband, Jared Kushner, and her sister-in-law, Nicole Meyer, reports the New York Times. Trump has moved into her own office on the West Wing's second floor and is in the process of obtaining a security clearance. She won't be taking a salary, though she'll receive fixed payments from the Trump Organization and will recuse herself from any administration decisions that affect her business, reports Politico. Ethics experts have raised concerns about the unprecedented situation in which a president's adult child is now serving as a de facto White House adviser, though a White House spokeswoman says Trump's role was approved by the White House counsel's office and the office of government ethics ""worked through"" the conflict-of-interest issues."

 By J. Taylor Rushing - 
 
 After a year of waiting in line, legislation to promote food safety on Wednesday moved toward passage during the Senate’s lame-duck session. 
 
 Almost a year to the day after a unanimous committee vote, the long-stalled food-safety bill by Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) passed on a 74-25 procedural vote.

They want small family farms to be exempt from the sweeping new regulations and are pushing for an amendment to that effect from Montana Democrat Jon Tester. Two high-profile names from the food world are on board, notes Food Safety News: Michael Pollan and Eric Schlosser. ""S 510 is the most important food safety legislation in a generation,"" they said in a joint statement. ""The Tester amendment will make it even more effective, strengthening food safety rules while protecting small farmers and producers. We both think this is the right thing to do.""

962,"– Twenty years after the world's worst nuclear accident, the Chernobyl exclusion zone is a much better place for wildlife than it was before the disaster, according to a new study. Researchers say a long-term census of mammals in the area—including wild boar, roe deer, elk, and wolves—found ""much higher"" numbers than they were before the April 1986 disaster, the BBC reports. ""The numbers of animals we see in Chernobyl is similar to the populations in uncontaminated nature reserves,"" says lead researcher Jim Smith of the University of Portsmouth.

""Once have left an area the wildlife appear to thrive—even if the habitat is laced with radiation."" The study, published in Current Biology, compared four nearby nature reserves that were uncontaminated by the accident to the exclusion zone and found that the abundance of wolves is more than seven times greater there than in the uncontaminated reserves. ""These unique data showing a wide range of animals thriving within miles of a major nuclear accident illustrate the resilience of wildlife populations when freed from the pressures of humans,"" a study co-author says in a press release.

On June 4, 1629, the Dutch East India ship the Batavia was downed by a reef on its maiden voyage. Most of the roughly 340 people aboard managed to reach nearby Beacon Island, off Western Australia, with the ship's captain setting off in search of help in a longboat. What happened in July of that year was gruesome: The West Australian reports that more than 120 people, among them women and children, were massacred by a group of mutineers led by undermerchant Jeronimus Cornelisz: Some were felled by musket fire or swords, others poisoned or drowned. Upon the captain's return, Cornelisz and many of his men were executed, reports the BBC. The Batavia's wreck was found in 1963, and a mass grave on the island was uncovered in 1999. Australia's ABC reports that the final day of searching the island during a 2013 expedition surfaced a tooth. Upon returning, archaeologists searched the area where the tooth was uncovered and have now found the island's 11th skeleton—with an archaeologist explaining it's the first to have been found using archaeology, while the others found to date were uncovered ""by accident."" Two musket balls were recovered near the remains, which are believed to be that of a youth.

The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak a global emergency, and the Florida Department of Health is advising women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant to avoid traveling to areas affected by the virus. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is responsible for 90% of Zika cases in the continental US and more than 90% of Guillain-Barre cases in Latin America and the Caribbean. It's also responsible for 40% of microcephaly cases in babies born to women who contracted the virus while pregnant.

One man had sexual contact with a woman who returned from Venezuela, while the other man had sex with the woman after returning to the US.

The market pressure is due partly to Italian's high sovereign debt and sluggish economy, but also to concern that Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi may be trying to undermine and even push out Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti, who has promoted deep spending cuts to control the budget deficit. ""We can't go on for many more days like Friday,"" a senior ECB official said. "" We're very worried about Italy."" Today's emergency meeting will precede a previously scheduled gathering of the eurozone's 17 finance ministers to discuss how to secure a contribution of private sector investors to the second bailout of Greece.","– European Union President Herman Van Rompuy has called an emergency meeting of top officials to discuss the euro zone's debt crisis, amid fears that the crisis could spread to Italy, the region's third-largest economy.

4515,"– Mitt Romney laid out a laundry list of Donald Trump's failures in a speech to the National Federation of Republican Women on Wednesday, and the New York Times has some highlights: Trump University: The Better Business Bureau says Trump University doesn't currently have an A rating, despite Trump claiming as much on the campaign trail. The BBB says it ""has continually been 'No Rating' since September 2015,' and the rating "" fluctuated between D- and A+"" before hitting an A+ in January 2015.

""While some loved the steaks, the vitriol and disgust from many of those who ordered the highly-touted home shopping network meat was striking.

""These complaints affected the Trump University BBB rating, which was as low as D- in 2010,"" the BBB says in a statement. ""But after 2013, no new complaints were reported as 'the company appeared to be winding down.'

1184,"– A writer for the New York Times got kicked out of a high-end Manhattan restaurant after complaining about the chef's ""loud, sustained, top-of-lungs yelling"" in the kitchen. ""I told the chef that his behavior was making me and others uncomfortable. I let him know that I thought it was mean,"" Jennifer Forgione writes in New York. ""And I asked him to cut it out. I don’t remember exactly what he said in response, but whatever it was, I found it irritating enough that I reminded him that I was paying to eat there and told him again to stop berating his staff at that volume."" When the chef returned, he apologized and said it was ""incredibly rude of me to come into his kitchen and tell him how to do his job. I repeated the fact that he had been ruining my dinner. But his yelling was all in the interest of maintaining quality, he said. 'I think it’s time for you to go.' 'Are you kicking me out?' I asked. 'Yes.' He replied. I’m not naive about restaurants. People who work there sometimes yell, though usually out of earshot. And when I eat in a higher-end establishment like this, I'm not sorry I spoke up.""

Among the reactions: “No one but the most self-entitled jerk of a customer walks into the kitchen. In other words, he kicked him out. One problem with working in the restaurant business is that the customer seems particularly inclined to believe he is running the show, when, in fact, he is not.” “If you don’t want to be the next Lieber, loathed by your server and despised by the kitchen staff, here are a few easy steps to not being the idiot at table 5.” “I’m not sorry I spoke up. ... I could only guess that eating was intimate enough, it prompted people to feign an intimacy that wasn’t there, to shut out any intruder, especially one who’s hands were uncomfortably close to your food.”",,,
3142,"– skunk is ""like a turbo-charged version of ordinary cannabis—and it's laced with chemicals, too,"" a drug counselor tells Sky News. ""I see so many young people who are having their mental health decimated by this drug. I see them in hospitals, in psychiatric wards, and it is absolutely heart-breaking."" Researchers at King's College London looked at 800 people aged 18 to 65 in London, including 410 who reported a first episode of psychosis at a London psychiatric hospital and 370 healthy participants within the same age range. They found skunk users were three times more likely to develop psychosis than non-users, while heavy users were fivefold more likely. ""Compared with those who had never tried cannabis, users of high potency skunk-like cannabis had a threefold increase in risk of psychosis,"" says lead author Marta Di Forti. ""The results show that psychosis risk in cannabis users depends on both the frequency of use and cannabis potency."" The study found psychosis was more common among people who used hashish, not skunk, the main psychoactive ingredient. Unlike skunk, hashish contains another chemical called cannabidiol, or CBD, and research suggests this can act as an antidote to the THC, counteracting psychotic side effects. ""As someone affected by this issue it is hard watching mainstream media, particularly comedy films, portraying cannabis as a harmless life-enhancing substance with limited ill-effects,"" one user tells the BBC. ""It's simply not true.""","– Smoking ""skunk-like"" cannabis triples a person's risk of psychosis, according to a new study out of King's College London. skunk is the ""Incredible Hulk of cannabis,"" a recovering addict herself tells Sky News. ""It's not the weed that many parents may have experimented with at university or college. This is a very, very potent drug. It's like a turbo-charged version of ordinary cannabis—and it's laced with chemicals, too."" Researchers looked at 800 people aged 18 to 65 in London, including 410 who had suffered psychosis and 370 healthy participants within the same age range. They found skunk users were three times more likely to develop psychosis than non-users, while heavy users were fivefold more likely. Smoking skunk-like cannabis was associated with 24% of new psychosis cases. ""For years I have shuddered as campaigners have sought to declassify or promote the product as I understand first-hand the hidden yet, until now, unspoken dangers of this awful drug,"" says the study's lead author. ""I dabbled with a friends' group in my early 20s, and went from someone who had never experienced any mental health issues whatsoever, to an absolute wreck.""",,,

4910,"– How long would it take to reach the other side of the planet if you jumped in and let gravity pull you through? For decades, physics students have been asked to calculate that time and have been taught that the correct answer is 42 minutes. Now, a more realistic analysis has lopped 4 minutes off that estimate. ""This is the kind of paper we love,"" says David Jackson, editor of the American Journal of Physics. The new calculation, which appears in the March issue of the journal, doesn't merely add more detail about the structure of Earth. It also explains why you can replace one overly simple assumption with another equally crude one and still get a much more accurate answer. The gravity tunnel problem is a staple of introductory physics courses because it simultaneously demonstrates both striking features of Isaac Newton's law of gravity and a common but very important type of cyclical motion. To solve it, students must calculate how the force of gravity on an object changes as the thing falls through the tunnel. Students assume that, like a billiard ball, Earth has the same density throughout: roughly 5500 kilograms per cubic meter. In that case, the strength of the gravitational force pulling you toward Earth's center varies in proportion to the distance from the center. Alexander Klotz, a student at McGill University in Canada, used seismic data to calculate the densities at different depths and found it would only take 38 minutes (and 11 seconds) to fall all the way through. ""It is accepted that the speed attained during the descent on the first half of the journey would be significant enough to cause the person to continue moving against gravity against the surface of the Earth at a constant surface.""","– How long would it take to reach the other side of the planet if you jumped in and let gravity pull you through?
