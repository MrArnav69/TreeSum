The scandal also expanded to include five other service members who are staying at the same hotel as the agents in Cartagena, Colombia, reports AP. They have been confined to their quarters and ordered not to have contact with others. All the alleged activities took place before Obama arrived Friday in the city for meetings with 33 other regional leaders.

A spokesperson for BMW tells the Times the company isn't planning on selling its domain and that Alphabet was a large part of its business. \"It's oddly comforting to know Google/Alphabet has the same problem many do when they're trying to purchase a domain for their own website,\" Mashable notes.

For example, Justice Stephen Breyer said that unlike a rooftop TV antenna, the service doesn't use content from a broadcast station to stream to users. He also wondered why \"phonograph records\" could soon go the way of brick-and-mortar stores. \"The justices seemed to think that if they ruled in favor of broadcasters, it would be a death knell for cloud-based services like this, and they sounded as if they were worried about the future of DVRs,\" writes Denniston.

The major broadcast networks are suing it for copyright violation, and stand to lose billions in fees cable companies pay to carry their programming.

Here's how the arguments went: \"If you're comfortable with the Supreme Court resolving disputes over technology, the transcript of Tuesday's oral arguments \u2026 should change your mind,\" writes Jon Healey at the LA Times. Stephen Breyer at one point made an analogy to \"what used to be called a phonograph record store.\" He also worried that Aereo's antennas could \"pick up every television signal in the world,\" which isn't true, Healey pointed out, \"because the world isn't, you know, flat.\" The justices seemed skeptical of Aereo's business model. \"It's not logical to me that you can make these millions of copies and essentially sell them to the public,\" Sonia Sotomayor said. John Roberts said the company was only using thousands of small antennas, instead of a few big ones \"to get around copyright laws,\" the Wall Street Journal reports. But the justices also seemed genuinely worried that their decision could stifle innovation. Sotomayor asked what effect this would have on \"the Dropbox and the iCloud.\" When the broadcasters' lawyers told them to \"just be confident\" that Aereo's service was different, Samuel Alito said, \"I don't find that very satisfying. \u2026 I need to understand what effect it will have on these other technologies.\" Aereo's best hope is that the justices adhere to a lower court's Cartoon Network vs. Cablevision ruling, which held that customers could make DVR recordings on Cablevision's hard drives, writes Lyle Denniston at SCOTUSblog. At one point, Anthony Kennedy suggested lawyers pretend that decision had come from the high court. Ultimately, the justices didn't seem to like their options. \"This is really hard for me,\" Sotomayor confessed. \"I don't see how to get out of it,\" Breyer agreed.",

More: Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott says the government will look into why the 50-year-old was out on bail and why he did not appear on the country's terrorist watch list, the BBC reports. \"How can someone who has had such a long and checkered history not be on the appropriate watch lists, and how can someone like that be entirely at large in the community?\" he wondered at a press conference today. \"These are questions that we need to look at carefully and calmly and methodically.\" Just three days before he walked into the cafe with a gun and took 17 people hostage, Monis had failed in an attempt to overturn a conviction for sending \"grossly offensive\" letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. The country's High Court rejected his application to hear a fresh constitutional challenge to the charges against him, for which he was sentenced to 300 hours of community service. Monis, who declared himself to be a sheikh and a \"spiritual healer,\" was seen as a \"fringe figure\" in Sydney's Islamic community, according to a Guardian profile. Shia Muslim leaders had asked police to probe his claims to be a leading cleric and last week, he announced on his website that he had converted to Sunni Islam and pledged allegiance to ISIS. The lawyer who represented Monis in the murder case tells the Australian Broadcasting Company that his client, who came to the country as a refugee in 1996, may have thought he had \"nothing to lose,\" hence \"participating in something as desperate and outrageous as this.\" He says that while in prison, Monis suffered some \"very unpleasant events, involving matters of excrement over himself and his cell,\" and he is certain that the siege was the act of a \"one-off random individual,\" not an organized terrorist group.",

He was wearing two tourist bags around his neck and I assumed he had hers. She was feigning disinterest, but I could tell she was listening in.

Austin Pledger, from Thorsby, Ala., was first prescribed Risperdal, manufactured by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, in 2002 when he was 8; at the time, the drug wasn't FDA-approved for kids, and its label said risk was \"low\" for gynecomastia (the condition in which men's breasts grow larger), Thomas Kline, one of Pledger's attorneys, tells the Daily News. But when the FDA gave the green light in 2006 for the drug to be used as a schizophrenic aid for kids, new labels said the drug contained high levels of the hormone prolactin, which spurs breast growth, Kline adds. Pledger had started growing breasts by then\u2014and now, the only way he can get rid of them is through a mastectomy, Kline says. A Janssen spokeswoman sent a statement to People noting the company is \"disappointed\" in the decision and that the drug's side effects were clearly spelled out for Pledger's family and prescribing physician. The spokeswoman also argued that Pledger's \"quality of life was significantly improved during the time he was taking Risperdal,\" per the Daily News. But Stephen Sheller, another Pledger attorney, says \"there was grave mistreatment of children\" and that Johnson & Johnson \"hid data from the FDA, prescribing doctors, and parents. Documents showed they knew there was much [a] higher percentage of children getting gynecomastia than they admitted,\" reports the Wall Street Journal. Still waiting to be settled in the Philly court system: more than 1,200 other cases against Risperdal, says Kline.

Police say the girl had a cellphone she could use to call her mother in case of emergency, and on the third day of her stay at the park, someone asked where her mom was. The girl said her mom, McDonald's worker Debra Harrell, was at work. Her daughter is now in the custody of social services. At Slate, Amanda Marcotte writes that it \"angers me, as a citizen, to see the police overreach this way.\" But she adds that it's \"recent and rare\" for a parent to be charged with a crime, and that the vagueness of state laws leaves \"a lot of room for discretion by social workers, police, judges, and prosecutors.\" Marcotte points out that Harrell is black, and class is definitely behind her situation: When welfare reform was passed in the '90s, single mothers were pushed into low-paying, full-time work that did not provide enough income to afford child care. At Salon, Tracy Clark-Flory writes that by arresting this mom (presumably causing her to lose her job) and putting the child far more trauma than she was ever likely to suffer in the park ... \"even if the state felt it had the right to declare this parenting decision impermissible, couldn't they have given this woman a simple warning before taking custody?\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Should sending your kid to play alone at a local park land you in jail? Because that's what happened to Debra Harrell. The 46-year-old South Carolina mom repeatedly sent her 9-year-old daughter to a well-trafficked park while she went to work at McDonald's. When the parents of other children at the park found out, they called police, who arrested Harrell and charged her with unlawful conduct toward a child. The daughter has been placed in state custody. Local news outlets first reported the story on July 1, but it's been getting wider attention lately thanks to an indignant post on Reason from \"Free Range Kids\" advocate Lenore Skenazy. And so far, pretty much everyone agrees that the arrest is senseless and wrong. Some reactions: Skenazy notes that the original news reports make it sound like Harrell \"committed a serious, unconscionable crime,\" as locals speculate that the girl could have been kidnapped. \"To which I must ask: In broad daylight? In a crowded park? Just because something happened on Law & Order doesn't mean it's happening all the time in real life.\" \"Since I'm a parent, Harrell\u2019s arrest scares me: How can I appropriately parent my child when doing something that seems relatively safe, if out of fashion, can get you arrested?\" asks Jessica Grose at Slate. One law professor tells Grose that the statutes for child welfare laws are often broadly written, giving police lots of latitude\u2014and allowing \"race, class, and gender biases to influence decisions.\" That could be the case here, because Harrell is black, and her poverty helped cause the situation. \"The story is a convergence of helicopter parenting with America\u2019s primitive family policy,\" writes Jonathan Chait at New York. \"Our welfare policy is designed to make everybody, even single mothers, work full-time jobs. The social safety net makes it difficult for low-wage single mothers to obtain adequate child care. And society is seized by bizarre fears that children are routinely snatched up by strangers in public places,\" which is actually an exceedingly rare phenomenon. \"The state has caused the child far more trauma than she was ever likely to suffer in the park,\" writes Conor Friedersdorf at the Atlantic, and they're taking the child at a time when the state has a shortage of foster families. And there's no empirical evidence saying the child would be safer, say, sitting at McDonald's. \"The actual safety of a given kid is not being rigorously determined. State employees are drawing on their prejudices to make somewhat arbitrary judgment calls.\"",

They returned them to the library after the US invasion in 2001 and began the most comprehensive geologic survey of Afghanistan ever conducted. But in 2009, a Pentagon task force that had created business development programs in Iraq was transferred to Afghanistan, and came upon the geological data. Until then, no one besides the geologists had bothered to look at the information\u2014and no one had sought to translate the technical data to measure the potential economic value of the mineral reserves. Now, the Pentagon is helping Afghan officials set up a system to deal with mineral development. \u201cThey\u2019ve had some small artisanal mines, but now there could be some very, very large mines that will require more than just a gold pan,\u201d says one official. \"This will become the backbone of the Afghan economy,\" says an adviser to the Afghan mines minister.

The Senate majority leader had to surrender on ObamaCare repeal, ally Bob Corker announced he was retiring, and, perhaps worst of all, the Senate candidate that McConnell strongly backed in Alabama got trounced by one backed by the Steve Bannon contingent. Just how bad is it for McConnell? Here's a look at coverage: Mocked by Trump: The president has taken to doing physical impressions of a slump-shouldered McConnell, reports Axios. Trump also reportedly called out McConnell as \"weak\" at a dinner with conservative activists, reports Politico. On the wane: McConnell has gone from \"brilliant tactician\" to looking vulnerable after the defeats this week, reports the New York Times. If the GOP fails to get tax reform passed this year, his post as majority leader could be in jeopardy\u2014especially with populist insurgents backed by Bannon looking to win more seats. No immediate danger: Both Politico and the Times say McConnell retains rock-solid support in the Republican Conference and thus is not in any immediate peril. Much of that support is based on his formidable fundraising skills on behalf of Senate Republicans. Beware the midterms: In a piece subtitled, \"Is the Senate Leader Losing His Grip on the GOP?,\" Abigail Tracy at Vanity Fair notes that midterm elections in general are often unkind to the party in power: \"With the GOP in the midst of an ideological schism, McConnell\u2019s faction could be headed for a reckoning.\" Indeed, Tuesday's triple whammy \"just shows how weak the Republican establishment is right now,\" writes Harry Enten at FiveThirtyEight. Boehner's fate? McConnell is willing to take all the criticism coming from conservatives over the ObamaCare fail, especially if it protects rank-and-file Republicans, per an analysis at the Washington Post. \"But one thing that could hamper McConnell\u2019s long-term standing would be if he became a real albatross to his own incumbents in primary elections ahead,\" writes Paul Kane. Fear of that played a role in John Boehner's resignation as House speaker two years ago. False narrative: Many in the media are portraying the Alabama results as a loss for Trump, but winner Roy Moore is decidedly Trumpian, writes Erick Erickson at the Resurgent.

Tannerite is used to make explosives because it is stable and cannot be set off by smoldering fuse, electronic fuse, an electrical current, an open flame, or even a low-velocity handgun, according to Steve Yerger, a corporate investigator for Tannerite. It's also sold in many sporting goods stores. \"We feel horrible that Tannerite has been associated with the bombing,\" Yerger says. \"The entire staff of Tannerite stands.\" Investigators believe the bomb was set off with an unexploded pressure cooker attached to a pipe. Sources tell the New York Daily News that the pipe bomb, which failed to detonate when it was placed near a trash bin, was made with Tannerite, a two-part mixture of ammonium nitrate and powdered aluminum that's popular for target practice because it produces a loud bang and puff of smoke when hit with a fast-moving bullet. The compound has been linked to attacks before, including the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, the 2013 Texas blast that killed 15 people, and the 2013 blast at a New Jersey mall that injured 23 people, Popular Mechanics reports.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A legal product that can be purchased online or at a sporting goods store was used in the bomb that went off in Manhattan Saturday, USA Today reports. Tannerite is a product typically used for target practice; it is placed on targets and explodes when struck by a bullet from a high-powered rifle. It's sold in two inert parts (ammonium nitrate and aluminum powder), neither of which is regulated by the ATF. Once those two parts are mixed together, it only explodes if a bullet hits it and is considered very stable, a corporate investigator for Tannerite says. Tannerite residue was found inside the bomb that exploded in Chelsea, a federal law enforcement official tells USA Today. A post on the company's Facebook page Monday reads, \"The entire staff of Tannerite stands together in the abhorrence and unintended use of all products that are misused for violence and hate.\" It goes on to note that its investigator is working to verify that Tannerite was indeed used in the bomb. A former FBI agent tells CBS News Tannerite appears to be \"on the defensive.\" \"It\u2019s just something we have to be aware of that these terrorists are very clever at finding out what components can come together and make an improvised exploding device,\" he says.

Some highlights from the annual ceremony at Harvard University, which was presented by the Annals of Improbable Research: \"Goat man\" Tom Thwaites wore his goat legs to the awards ceremony .He tells the BBC that he gained a \"goat buddy\" during his time in the Alps\u2014but there were some tense moments. \"I was just sort of walking around, you know, chewing grass, and just looked up and then suddenly realized that everyone else had stopped chewing and there was this tension which I hadn't kind of noticed before and then one or two of the goats started tossing their horns around and I think I was about to get in a fight,\" he says. Thwaites shared the biology prize with Charles Foster, another Brit who has spent time living in the wild as, among other things, a badger, an otter, and a fox. Science reports that the medicine prize went to a team of neurologists and psychologists, who, with the help of video cameras, mirrors, and volunteers injected with a chemical that causes a mild itch, discovered that scratching the left side of your body will relieve an itch on the right side if you're looking in a mirror at the time. A Japanese team won the perception prize with a study published as \"Perceived Size and Perceived Distance of Targets Viewed From Between the Legs: Evidence for Proprioceptive Theory.\" Their research involved bending over and looking at things from between their legs to see if they looked any different. Egyptian urologist Ahmed Shafik was posthumously awarded the reproduction prize for his research on how wearing trousers of polyester, cotton, or wool affected the sex lives of rats. The rats that wore polyester had the biggest drop in sexual activity, notes the Guardian. This year's Ig Nobel in chemistry went to Volkswagen, for \"solving the problem of excessive automobile pollution emissions by automatically, electromechanically producing fewer emissions whenever the cars are being tested.\" (Previous Ig Nobels have gone to scientists who swallowed parboiled dead shrews and a researcher who allowed bees to sting every part of his anatomy.)",

But with Jobs resigning as CEO, everyone is wondering what the future holds for Apple. Some reactions: What will change? Not much, write Nathan Olivarez-Giles and Thomas Suh Lauder for the LA Times. In his role as CEO, Jobs had to answer to two groups: shareholders, and the board of directors. Now he's at the helm of that board. It was the perfect time to go, writes Brian Barrett for Gizmodo, noting that the coming release of the iPhone 5 and more affordable iPhone 4 should buoy the company and give CEO Tim Cook a chance to step into the spotlight. \"If they'd waited any longer, the iPhone 5 announcement would've been fully shrouded in memories of Jobs. ... This feels calculated, in the best possible way, to happen at the best possible time. Now.\" Apple has lost its core, writes Rupert Goodwins for ZDNet, and only time will tell how this plays out.

Aaron Leider sued the zoo in 2007 over its treatment of elephants, claiming they were subjected to \"cruel, abusive, and illegal treatment.\" According to NBC Los Angeles, Leider's lawsuit alleged that the zoo used chains, drugs, bullhooks, and electric shocks on the elephants, leading to their premature deaths. In 2012, a judge ordered the zoo to do away with those methods and exercise the elephants regularly. A divided appeals court upheld that ruling. On Thursday, the state supreme court ruled that Leider couldn't use the taxpayer money to enforce the criminal mistreatment of the elephants. \u201cHere, the trial court found that the city and its zoo director had violated code statutes proscribing animal abuse, but it provided them neither the right to penal a jury trial nor the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d Justice Carol Corrigan wrote for the unanimous court. \u201cMoreover, [Leider] was permitted to exercise the discretion reserved for the district attorney with regard to enforcement of the criminal law. For these reasons, the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment cannot stand.\u201d An attorney for Leider called the ruling \"ridiculous.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 For years, the Los Angeles Zoo has been under a court order requiring it to exercise its three elephants on soft ground and not use electric shocks or barbed sticks on them. On Thursday, that court order was overturned in a unanimous decision by the California Supreme Court that animal activists are decrying. A Los Angeles County Superior Court judge issued the injunction against the zoo in 2012 in response to a taxpayer lawsuit alleging animal cruelty. But in what the Los Angeles Times calls a \"highly technical ruling\" overturning the injunction, the state's highest court said a taxpayer lawsuit (which uses civil law rules) can't be used to address criminal conduct. The taxpayer lawsuit began in 2007 when an LA resident sued over what he said was abusive treatment of the elephants, also including the use of chains and drugs, Courthouse News Service reports. A lawyer who worked on the case, for free, for more than five years says he'll attempt to find another way to get a similar injunction against the zoo, or request that the state legislature overturn the ruling. \"I thought we had done something here to move the ball forward and instead the Supreme Court has allowed the zoo to take a step into the Dark Ages,\" he says. The Supreme Court explained in its ruling that by obtaining the injunction in such a way, the court did not allow the zoo to have a jury trial or the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The barbed sticks known as bull hooks have since been banned entirely in California, and for its part, the zoo says that it has never used and will never use them or electric shocks as disciplinary tools for its elephants, and that it will continue to follow the court order despite it being overturned.",

The International Union for the Conservation of Nature made the move after determining that giraffes are at risk of extinction, along with the okapi, National Geographic reports. There are only two giraffe species\u2014one in Africa and one in Asia\u2014and populations of both have dropped by as much as 40% over the past 30 years. \"While there have been great concern about elephants and rhinos, giraffes have gone under the radar,\" Julian Fennessy, co-chair of the giraffe specialist group at IUCN, tells the BBC. \"Unfortunately, their numbers have been plummeting, and this is something that we were a little shocked about, that they have declined by so much in so little.\" Of the nine giraffe species, three have increasing populations, while five have decreasing populations and one is stable, per a press release. \"Most people have no idea that both species of giraffid, the giraffe, and the OKapi ... are on the brink of extinction,\" says Inger Andersen, director general of the IUCN, per National Geographic. \"Many species are slipping away before we can even describe them.\"",

In 1985, there were between 152,000 and 163,000 giraffes, but that number dropped to 97,000 by 2015\u2014a \"devastating decline\" of nearly 40% that now moves the animal from the \"least concern\" category into the \"vulnerable\" one on the group's Red List. \"While there [has] been great concern about elephants and rhinos, giraffes have gone under the radar,\" says Dr. Fennessy, co-director of the IUCN's Giraffe Conservation arm. The updated Red List, released Thursday at a biological diversity conference in Cancun, Mexico, points to man as the main driver of the declining stats, with poaching, habitat loss, and local unrest all assuming partial blame. A Duke University conservation biologist says the IUCN is partly to blame, too, for not considering more species threatened. \"There's a strong tendency to think that familiar species [such as giraffes, chimps, etc.] must be OK because ... we see them in zoos,\" he tells the AP. \"This is dangerous.\" Some good news, at least for some long-neckers: Of the nine giraffe subspecies, three of them are experiencing increasing populations; one is stable.

Herrera's office has produced screen shots of Monster's \"Monster Army\" website, which lists 11-year-old Major Frank and 6-year- old Reserve Frank as major players.

The unnamed teen is believed to have made more than 200 threats over the last two and a half years, forcing at least a dozen schools, airports, daycare centers, and other institutions to be evacuated. He was identified through bomb-sniffing dogs that detected his DNA on some of the envelopes used to make the threats. \"This is the guy we are talking about,\" an Israeli police spokesman tells the AP.

The 19-year-old male living in the Ashkelon area of Israel was arrested Thursday after a months-long investigation involving the FBI, Israeli police rep Micky Rosenfeld tells CNN. Police say the teen used neighbors' internet connections, voice manipulation, and other \"advanced camouflage technologies\" to hide his identity while making threats against Jewish centers in the US, Australia, and New Zealand, the New York Times reports, via Israel Radio. However, police believe he's also responsible for hundreds of other threats around the world over two or three years, reports Haaretz. Those include threats against shopping malls and airports. In one case, he forced a Delta flight to make an emergency landing, police say. Authorities say five computers, antennas, and other equipment were seized from his residence. Per Haaretz, the teen tried to grab the gun of an officer who arrived to arrest him; he was previously found unfit for military service in Israel. Police had previously said they were searching for a single individual believed to be behind the majority of more than 100 bomb threats made against Jewish centers in the US this year. \"This is the guy we are talking about,\" Rosenfeld says. The teen appeared in court on Thursday. (Federal officials have also traced some of the bomb threats to a jilted ex-boyfriend.)",

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 During a White House meeting on Oct. 2, a day into the shutdown, John Boehner slipped out for a smoke. Barack Obama followed him, demanding a private explanation for the shutdown. \"John, what happened?\" he asked. \"I got overrun, that's what happened,\" Boehner replied. That anecdote kicks off Politico's behind-the-scenes look at the crisis. The Wall Street Journal has one too\u2014with different bits of insider gossip. Here are the most interesting tidbits from both: Obama and Harry Reid decided on their no-negotiation strategy over the summer, believing that Boehner could never unite his fractured caucus behind anything. Republicans never believed the pair would stick to it. Boehner and Reid initially struck a deal in which Boehner would pass a sequester-level budget with an ObamaCare-defunding rider that the Senate could simply strip out. Boehner assumed\u2014incorrectly\u2014that his caucus only wanted a show vote. Boehner's former chief of staff was feeding the White House intelligence, telling it that Boehner would have to fight up until the debt ceiling deadline. Reid also took to monitoring Twitter for hints on the GOP's next move\u2014a sign of how badly communication was flowing. Many Republicans turned to Joe Biden, hoping he would intervene. Biden told them he'd been \"sidelined \u2026 at the direction of the president,\" one rep says. Reid, bitter about the fiscal cliff deal Biden negotiated, had wanted him out. At one point, Boehner brought up the idea of a \"grand bargain\" at a White House meeting; Reid laughed in his face. When Paul Ryan joined the fray at an Oct. 10 meeting, he told Obama that he would \"miss his moment\" and derail his whole term if he didn't strike a deal. But he also made what White House aides called a \"Freudian slip,\" saying, \"We\u2019re going to have six weeks to negotiate the debt limit.\" That night, aides to Boehner, Cantor, and Obama began talking about a broader budget deal, and agreed to talk more in the morning. The White House never called. When Mitch McConnell finally decided he had to broker the deal, he partnered with Lamar Alexander\u2014angering Susan Collins, who had worked far harder on the process, only to see her own deal torpedoed. McConnell picked Alexander because he had better conservative credentials, and was pals with Reid confidante Chuck Schumer. Alexander and Schumer brokered the deal behind the scenes, then passed it off to Reid and McConnell. McConnell tells the Washington Post that he saw himself as a backup quarterback thrown into the game. \"I felt like I was on the two-yard line, I had a pretty weak offensive line, and the best I could hope for was to try to punt.\" Boehner made one last-ditch attempt to pass an alternative. \"We're running out of time,\" he told his caucus. \"Your 'no' vote has consequences.\" But as Reid and Obama had predicted, he couldn't convince them. With the ball back in McConnell and Reid's court, McConnell made a few last-minute demands. Reid rejected them. It took all of 15 minutes for McConnell to call back and accept Reid's terms.",

Per CNN, Idaho State University has not been able to account for the bit of radioactive material since 2003 but, nonetheless, believes it was properly stored at a licensed disposal facility. However, with no documented proof, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Friday it must propose the fine. Dr. Cornelis Van der Schyf, vice president for research at the university, blamed partially completed paperwork from 15 years ago as the school tried to dispose of the plutonium. \"Unfortunately, because there was a lack of sufficient historical records to demonstrate the disposal pathway employed in 2003, the source in question had to be listed as missing,\" he said in a statement to the AP. The statement said the plutonium \"poses no direct health issue or risk to public safety.\" The plutonium was being used to develop ways to ensure nuclear waste containers weren't leaking and to find ways to detect radioactive material being illegally brought into the US following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. While the missing amount could not be used to make a nuclear bomb, it could be used to create a so-called dirty bomb to spread nuclear contamination. The university, which has 30 days to dispute the proposed fine, reported the plutonium missing on Oct. 13, according to documents released by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The agency said a school employee doing a routine inventory discovered the university could only account for 13 of its 14 plutonium sources, each weighing about the same small amount.",

Not exactly, researchers say. \"I believe that the brain during sleep is not at all totally detached from the external world, and stimuli, including those stemming from the environment, are probably incorporated into dream content more often than people observe or are aware of,\" says lead researcher Kai-Ching Yu. \"The unconscious brains of the dreamers try to make sense, and even make use of, the external stimuli.\" Sleeping on one's stomach compresses the spine, which can lead to lower back pain, so if you want to increase your chances of having sex dreams, you might\u2014another recent study found that sleeping on Your Back Can Cause Lower Back Pain.",

He dug up a 2004 study that asked 45 men and 18 women to sleep on one side or the other and fill out a popular sleep questionnaire called the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (which evaluates sleep using seven factors, including \"subjective sleep quality,\" sleep duration, and use of sleep drugs). The study found that just 14.6% of right-side sleepers reported bad dreams, compared to 40.9% of their lefty counterparts. Right-side sleepers also reported more dreams with feelings of safety or relief, but had worse-quality sleep than left-siders. Berical also found a 2012 study that analyzed the sleep positions and dreams of over 670 students. The study found that face-down sleepers had more positive and vivid dreams, which were more often about \"sex,\" \"being unable to move,\" \"being tied up,\" or \"being locked up,\" Van Winkles reports. The researcher behind that study, Calvin Kai-Ching Yu, concluded that \"the brain during sleep is not at all totally detached from the external world,\" adding that \"the unconscious brains of the dreamers try to make sense, and even make use of, the external stimuli.\" Berical's conclusion? \"It can\u2019t hurt to roll your loved one over when you sense a nightmare coming on,\" he writes. \"Assuming you can avoid the flailing arms, that is.\" (It turns out that humans are incredibly good at sleeping.)",

They believe he is suicidal and should be considered armed. Police say Pappas surrendered to them without a struggle early Thursday and is being held on capital murder charges. The shooting took place Wednesday afternoon near Houston Methodist Hospital, where the former star cardiologist was shot dead.

He said the last anyone had heard from Pappas was in a Tuesday morning text message in which Pappas wrote that he was going to kill himself. Acevedo said police searched his home at 4am Wednesday and found evidence that ties Pappas to the killing, but he declined to elaborate as to the nature of the evidence. The chief said Pappas, who was a peace officer in Harris County for three decades per the Houston Chronicle, is white and very fit, and that he's likely getting around on his 10-speed bicycle, which he rides \"extensively and almost exclusively.\" Friends and family have described Hausknecht as a humble and generous man who was adored by his patients, volunteered in his community and cared about the environment.

That means the jury of seven women and five men will have to decide whether he drugged and sexually assaulted Andrea Constand at his home in 2004, reports the AP. The big question is whether Cosby will testify to refute the allegations that he penetrated her with his fingers and then tried to cover it up. His decision not to take the stand could make the case \"difficult\" for the jury, according to James Cohen, a criminal law professor at Fordham, tells CNN. \"There is a big contrast,\" says Cohen. \"What Cosby is hoping for is that the jury forgets about the other 48.\" That would be Constand, who settled a civil suit against Cosby for $3.4 million in 2006, but she hasn't testified in a criminal trial. She has accused Cosby of drugging and sexually assaulting her in 2004, but the statute of limitations has run out on charges stemming from that alleged assault. If the jury finds Cosby not guilty, he could be sentenced to up to 30 years in prison. The defense plans to portray Constand as a greedy money-seeker who made off with a sweater Cosby promised to pay for her college education. The sweater may be a sign that Constand\u2014Cosby's first accuser\u2014is expected to testify in her own defense.",

Meanwhile, Constand herself is reportedly ready to face intense grilling on the witness stand. \"There's no trepidation, no fear,\" a close friend who's also one of Cosby's alleged victims tells NBC. \"She used to play basketball and she prepared for those games like nobody else and that is what she has done here.\" (Vice calls the trial a \"test for America.\")",

But in terms of the bottom line: advancing to a higher level, the difference was nil among the 11,000 gamers they analyzed playing Everquest II and Chevalier's Romance III. Aside from one study in 2009, Vocativ reports that this is the first to figure out how to go about testing gender differences in gaming performance outside of a lab. Why does it matter? Nearly half the gaming population is now female, yet they are represented at even lower numbers in STEM fields of science, technology, engineering, and math. \"The stereotype that women are worse players at games could contribute to a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" Shen says.

The court didn't rule on the specifics of the case, but it did say that the rules violated Section 706 of the Communications Act, which requires the FCC to regulate the Internet. Without net neutrality, Internet service providers can discriminate against certain types of traffic\u2014like streaming video or peer-to-peer file sharing\u2014and make more money at the expense of everyone else, writes Troy Wolverton at the San Jose Mercury News. \"Right now, America\u2019s broadband is slow. It\u2019s slow because ISPs can already make gobs of money by charging the rich a ton for high-quality Internet while leaving the rest of America with subpar (or no) service,\" he writes. \"Thanks to the ruling, broadband providers can now exert a lot more control over what sites you visit on the Internet and what services you can access.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Yesterday was the day net neutrality died, with a court ruling that Internet service providers aren't bound by FCC non-discrimination rules\u2014so they can prioritize some traffic over others. The decision may mean major changes for the everyday user, and today, media sites are offering the details. Among their warnings: The Wall Street Journal reports that the decision could have a huge impact on sites like Netflix and YouTube, whose video services hog a lot of bandwidth (they account for 32% and 19% of peak web traffic, respectively). If ISPs start making Netflix, for instance, pay a usage fee to maintain speedy content delivery, that cost could make a serious dent in its profits\u2014or trickle down to consumers. ISPs could charge sites big fees in exchange for faster content delivery, potentially giving giants who can pay, like Amazon, a big leg up over independent retailers\u2014not to mention other small businesses, the Huffington Post notes. Providers might even go so far as to prioritize traffic to partner sites\u2014Time Warner might push CNN, for example. Another anti-competitive fear, via BuzzFeed: Big companies might start paying your data fees for the use of their sites. That might sound good\u2014free data?\u2014but it would mean that companies with the ability to pay would have a major advantage over start-ups in winning users. As BuzzFeed points out, \"If, in this future, you're choosing between two streaming music services, and one of them pays for your data, there's a very good chance you\u2019re going to pick that one.\" Beyond concerns over fees, there are worries that providers could block certain websites completely: Comcast users could theoretically end up with no access to, say, Netflix or Vonage, writes Troy Wolverton in the San Jose Mercury News. But net neutrality, in some form, may live to see another day, the Journal notes, reporting that the ruling \"left open the door for the FCC to craft rules in a different form that might accomplish its earlier intentions.\"",

Washington state, Colorado, Oregon, and Alaska are asking a federal appeals court in Washington to declare that federal law forbids the government from arresting or incarcerating people for possessing small amounts of pot. \"This is a very weak claim,\" a law professor at Georgetown University tells the Huffington Post. \"Their real beef is with the Federal Government for not enforcement of the federal drug laws.\" In other marijuana news: Nebraska and Oklahoma are suing Colorado in the Supreme Court over the state's legalization of marijuana\u2014and they're not alone. A group called Safe Streets has filed suit on behalf of 10 residents who say Colorado's law classifying marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug violates their First Amendment rights. The lawsuit argues that since marijuana is still illegal under federal law, Colorado is violating the 14th Amendment by allowing its marijuana to be sold in places where it's already banned. The states also say the law is causing a rise in marijuana trafficking across state lines. Since Colorado legalized marijuana last year, crime rates are down, marijuana use among teens hasn't increased, and the state has taken in around $60 million in taxes and fees. But Mason Tvert, communications director for the Marijuana Policy Project, says the lawsuits are just another attempt by drug cartels to get their hands on the marijuana industry.",

This isn't the first group to take legal measures against the state. The attorneys general in Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit against Colorado last year, saying the free flow of pot across state lines is hurting communities. \"Left unchallenged, I am confident Colorado's law will cause long-term harm to Nebraska families,\" that state's AG, Doug Peterson, wrote in an open letter, as per the LA Times. And two lawsuits filed last month by an anti-drug group express similar complaints and add racketeering charges into the mix, the Huffington Post noted in February. Larimer County's sheriff says the DoJ's mostly hands-off policy in dealing with the new rules amounts to showing folks \"how to violate federal law but not get prosecuted,\" USA Today notes.

The tweet was in reference to the US military's most expensive aircraft, the $379 billion F-35 fighter jet, which Trump has criticized for being too expensive in the past, the Washington Post reports. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal last month, Trump called the jet \"out of control\" because it costs so much more than other aircraft in the US Air Force's inventory. He also criticized Boeing for building a plant in Mexico that will add 1,000 jobs and send 1,000 jobs out of the US. On Wednesday, Trump met with the CEOs of Lockheed Martin and Boeing at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Lockheed's share price fell almost 2% in after-hours trading after Trump's tweet, CNBC reports. A former Navy comptroller says he's never seen anything like it before. \"But I can't imagine it would,\" he says. \"President-elect Trump has been railing against Boeing since before the election, warning that he would slap tariffs on the company if it moved jobs overseas.\" It's unclear whether Trump\u2014President Trump\u2014is trying to get \"costs down\" on the F-35 or simply wants Boeing to sell him a \"comparative F 18 Super Hornet. Boeing responded by saying it would work with the administration to \"affordably meet US requirements.\"",

Trump shook up the defense industry once again on Thursday when he tweeted about negotiations for fighter jets, pitting Boeing and Lockheed Martin against each other, reports Reuters. \"Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!\" tweeted Trump, who has been holding meetings with aerospace execs at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Lockheed shares, which went down 4% after an earlier Trump tweet, dived 2% in after-hours trading, while Boeing was up 0.7%. A roundup of coverage: Politico takes a close look at the implications of Trump involving himself so closely in the federal procurement process and turning it into a \"$440 billion weapon.\" Presidents including Obama have used the process to advance their agendas, but experts say it's unprecedented for one to target individual companies and contracts the way Trump is doing\u2014and his approach is likely to create great uncertainty for defense companies. Business Insider looks at the F-35's capabilities\u2014and the $379 billion contract for Lockheed to supply 2,443 of them to the military. Pentagon officials involved with the F-35 says the fifth-generation jet is far ahead of the Boeing plane, meaning it would take years of redesigning and testing for the Super Hornet to have the same capabilities. The AP reports that Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher said: \"We have committed to working with the president-elect and his administration to provide the best capability, deliverability, and affordability,\" while Lockheed declined to comment. Bloomberg reports that Trump's action \"sidelined decades of policy and practice in how the government spends billions of dollars annually on military hardware.\" A Teal Group military aircraft analyst tells Bloomberg that Trump's tweet was \"bizarre,\" especially since only the Navy uses the Super Hornet, while the Marines are \"completely dependent\" on F-35Bs and the Air Force is sticking with the F-35A. \"Thus, Trump's tweet is both late to the game and completely irrelevant.\" Retired Rear Adm. Dave Oliver tells Politico that Trump's attempt to bring the tactics of the New York real estate market to military procurement will probably just drive prices up. \"He will scare the bejesus out of some fifth-level auditor who is going to say, 'Goodness gracious, maybe I ought to look at whoever he is attacking at the moment,' says Oliver, who was a top Pentagon acquisition official in the 1990s. \"Whether the president has any legal standing of any kind in this doesn't matter.

Here's what you need to know about the ruling and the American Health Care Act, or AHCA: The CBO will release an analysis on the AHCA Friday, and it's expected to show that 14 million people would lose coverage under the plan, reports the New York Times. That's because the ACA gave people with pre-existing conditions access to coverage. The bill scraps the Medicaid expansion, which covered millions of low-income Americans, and the federal government would pick up the cost. People who don't buy insurance would be hit with a penalty for not buying it. Chris Cillizza, Washington Post: It's \"a much 'nicer' measure for anyone with preexisting condition,\" he writes, calling it \"probably still mean.\" Michael Hiltzik, Time: \"In the end, the Senate was never going to be able to deliver a measure that was a whole lot nicer, despite Trump's pleas.\" This is because the Senate is using the process of reconciliation, which requires spending cuts to offset tax credits, to pay for the bill. CNN looks at the changes made to the bill behind closed doors Thursday. Among them: People making up to four times the federal poverty level would no longer be eligible for subsidies. Instead, they'd get a tax credit based on age, not income. ABC News reports that five Republican senators\u2014Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Ron Johnson, Mike Lee, and Mike Lee\u2014all have come out there are concerned that the bill could potentially provide enough to provide health care with a dose of anxiety.",

Some major sticking points: The Better Care Reconciliation Act will ask poor and middle-class Americans to pay more for less coverage, and Medicaid would be cut after expansions are rolled back. Medicaid patients would be unable to get treatment at Planned Parenthood, which would be defunded for a year. The bill also includes a tax break for the wealthy. Here's what else you need to know: First, Politico has the full text of the 142-page document Republicans are calling a \"discussion draft.\" Three Republican senators can defeat the bill by joining Democrats to vote against it. FiveThirtyEight reports the most likely candidates are Rand Paul and Mike Lee (who don't believe it goes far enough; Paul recently said he doesn't want \"ObamaCare lite\") and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski (who want more protections for Medicaid and pre-existing conditions). ABC News reports four Republican senators have already said they won't vote for the bill without more information and negotiation: Paul, Lee, Ron Johnson, and Ted Cruz. They released a joint statement saying the bill doesn't do enough to repeal ObamaCare. The bill's writing was cloaked in such secrecy that the Week reports as of Thursday morning quite a few Republican senators still had not seen it; Murkowski, for example, told a reporter, \"I am not a reporter, and I am not a lobbyist, so I've seen nothing.\" President Trump had called the House bill \"mean\" and in need of \"more heart.\" So Scientific American takes a look to see if the Senate version fulfills that requirement. When asked by a reporter if the Senate bill had enough heart, Trump called it \"very good\" but in need of \"a little negotiation,\" CNN reports. According to People, police dragged protesters\u2014some of them in wheelchairs or wearing medical devices\u2014away from Mitch McConnell's office and arrested them. The protesters, members of a national disability rights group, say people with disabilities are threatened by the bill.

Reporters tried to book the Las Vegas apartment for a day last month, and Amy Joy Lasee denied the request. Then a conservative talk radio host brought up the apartment listing. \"Your story is hard to swallow,\" he said.

The state ethics board dismissed a previous complaint against Lasee in 2014.

They're challenging a 1977 ruling that allowed public workers to be required to pay dues in order to form a union and bargain for their benefits. But nonmembers can't be forced to pay because the union is political, reports the New York Times.

The trail is \"open to all who wish to tackle its challenges,\" but \"those that choose to arrive unprepared can quickly find themselves in situations on the trail that begin to negatively affect others, as well as the trail environment,\" writes Kelly Servick at Outside magazine. That's because many hikers \"desperate to 'find themselves' often embark on such a challenging journey from a mindset of helplessness, rather than competence,\" she writes. \"This mentality of deliberate ineptitude often leads to on-trail actions that can serve to endanger themselves and the trailenvironment, and negatively affect the experience of other hikers with whom they share the trail.\" So far, donations are pouring in to help those hoping to make it along. The number of hikers attempting to complete the 1,650-mile trail in a single year has soared over the past few years thanks to the popularity of Strayed's book and the movie Wild, which has been nominated for three Oscars.

In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the PCTA's Jack Haskel told the AP in 2015. But after the movie, starring Reese Witherspoon, was released in 2014, interest in the PCT exploded. \"Millions are hearing about it now and are being inspired,\" Haskel said. Strayed, more or less unprepared for the journey, hiked 1,100 miles of the trail as a form of therapy as she grappled with personal demons. \"However for others that follow her strategy of deliberate ineptitude, things might not turn out so well,\" writes DontHikeLikeWild.org. \"Our advice to would-be hikers: Grow a spine first.

Yik Yak is popular on college campuses because it allows users within a relatively small area to post and receive anonymous messages on their phones.

The group\u2014which has been collecting the reports since 1989\u2014says there were more sightings in 2015 than in any other year since it began collecting the data in 1989, with an average of 16 minutes spent witnessing strange lights and shapes in the sky, CTV News reports. There were also sightings of black holes, meteors, UFOs, and shooting stars, the BBC reports. Some of the craziest sightings include a nighttime visit from \"a being with blonde hair and blue skin\" and three \"humanoids\" with \"big, black slanted eyes,\" who then reportedly heard a high-pitched hum and woke up the next morning. \"The ridicule factor is quite certainly there, but we're not saying the little grey guys are here,\" Ufologist Chris Rutkowski tells CTV. \"This is simply what people are reporting.\" He says that while some of the sightings may be hoaxes, the fact that so many people continue to report them shows\u2014Canada has seen a steady rise in reports of UFOs over the past few decades, and researchers are trying to figure out why. \"Is this phenomenon psychological, sociological, cultural, and/or physical? Is it our contemporary culture's storytelling?\" they write in an accompanying essay to the National Post. \"Or is the phenomenon something else? Physical objects created by our species or another form of life we cannot begin to understand.\"",

The annual Canadian UFO Survey by Winnipeg-based Ufology Research shows \"the second highest level of sightings that we've recorded since we started doing the survey back in the 1980s,\" with 1,267 across Canada in 2015, rep Chris Rutkowski tells the CBC. Only 2012 had more, with 1,981 sightings. The provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland each saw an increase in reports over 2014, but Quebec outpaced them all, according to data from 17 sources, including Transport Canada and YouTube. The province, which typically produces 5% to 15% of all UFO reports in Canada, generated 35% of reports in 2015, reports the Canadian Press. Montreal led Canadian cities with 97 reports, followed by 78 in Toronto, and 69 in Vancouver. That doesn't mean there were that many unexplained cases; about 88% of unidentifiable objects turn out to be stars, planets, airplanes, or helicopters, Rutkowski says. Ufology Research investigates the remaining cases\u2014by visiting a site and talking to witnesses\u2014to determine if a case is \"high quality.\" About 1% to 3% of cases fall into this group, Rutkowski says. One of the perhaps not-so-high-quality ones: A resident in Sainte-Brigitte de Laval, Quebec, recalled seeing three 4-feet-tall \"humanoids\" with huge heads and \"big, black slanted eyes,\" and hearing a high-pitched hum. \"We're not saying the little grey guys are here,\" Rutkowski tells CTV News. \"This is simply what people are reporting.\" (Aliens might also have a thing for Florida.)",

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 UFO enthusiasts last week got a gander of an alien allegedly recovered from Roswell\u2014oversized head and all\u2014but experts say the evidence likely originated on planet Earth, Tech Times reports. Attendees at a UFO conference in Mexico City paid $350 for the chance to see an old Kodachrome color slide said to capture an alien that crashed in New Mexico in 1947 (UFO lovers call it the \"Roswell Incident\"). A journalist apparently dated the film stock to the 1940s, Discovery reports, saying it was recovered in Arizona from an oil geologist's photo collection. The slide shows a small figure with a big head in a display case; Discovery argues that the skeleton belonged to a child (with typically oversized head) or the body of a mummified child with a deformed head. Such bodies have been turning up for years in the Americas and identified as extraterrestrials, Discovery reported last year. What's more, no eyewitness at Roswell in 1947 described aliens or even a flying saucer; the first one there talked about something \"made up of rubber strips, tinfoil, a rather tough paper and sticks\" (the US Air Force put it down to air balloons and radar detectors that crashed there). Yet UFO proponents at the Mexico City event stood firm: \"Analysis of the body ... suggested this is not a mummy and not a human, not a mammal and not a model,\" says enthusiast Richard Dolan, Reuters reports. A British defense official was less enthused, telling the Mirror that \"it could be a model, or it could simply be a fake image, dressed up to look like a Forties slide.\" (Read about Air Force UFO files now available online.)",

Here's what they're saying: \"Prometheus ends up with less to say than it thinks it does,\" writes Manohla Dargis in the New York Times. It's \"part philosophical treatise, part pulp fiction, part pure horror show,\" but it \"does not wear its themes lightly. It pushes too hard for significance, which is dicey in and of itself for genre material and contrasts badly with the standard nature of some of the story.\" The visuals are so good, \"you'll feel like you've been transported to another dimension.\" They're \"impossible to miss.\" Peter Travers at Rolling Stone calls it \"a visceral adventure with a sense of mystery that will have you on edge until the end.\" Fassbender \"is the best thing about Prometheus,\" writes Joe Morgenstern at the Wall Street Journal. But he's not the only one impressed with the film as a whole: \"It's a tale of redemption, moral courage, and the triumph of good over evil\" that is \"slowly building to a climax that will blow your mind,\" he writes.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Critics agree: The visuals in Ridley Scott's Prometheus are stunning.

The film \"is more interested in piling on big questions than in answering them. It\u2019s deep without being particularly smart,\" though its design and effects are so \"dazzling\" you won't realize \"that basic flaw until at least an hour in.\" Joe Morgenstern echoes Stevens in the Wall Street Journal. \"This tale of an interstellar search asks cosmic questions about the meaning of life, but comes up with lame answers in a script that screams attention-deficit disorder,\" he notes. Still, it's \"worth seeing for the quality of its sci-fi sights.\" In the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan notes that the movie \"pushes too hard for significance,\" which \"contrasts badly with the standard nature of some of the story's plotting.\" For \"its wizardly director, it's something of a disappointment.\" But at the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert raves that Prometheus is \"a seamless blend of story, special effects, and pitch-perfect casting, filmed in sane, effective 3-D that doesn't distract.\" And Ebert finds it \"all the more intriguing because it raises questions about the origin of human life and doesn't have the answers.\"",

Former CIA agent Jack McCone told the Warren Commission in 1964 that he had been briefed on CIA plots to kill Fidel Castro and Martin Luther King Jr., but he didn't tell the panel because he was worried about damaging the investigation. \"The decision of McCone and Agency leaders in 1964 not to disclose information about CIA\u2019s anti-Castro schemes might have done more to undermine the credibility of the commission than anything else that happened while it was conducting its investigation,\" the report says. \"In that sense\u2014and in that sense alone\u2014McCone may be regarded as a 'co-conspirator' in the JFK assassination 'cover-up.'\" At the Daily Beast, Philip Shenon writes that the CIA is finally admitting that there are still some secrets surrounding the assassination hidden in its files. Among the evidence he cites: a letter from a top CIA official to President Richard Nixon in which the official explains that the agency had no reason to believe that Lee Harvey Oswald was connected to the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1961. The letter goes on to say the CIA believed Oswald was working for the Cuban government, and that the crisis was a \"direct result\" of JFK's policies toward Cuba. \"Had the administration's obsession with Cuba inadvertently inspired a politicized sociopath to murder John Kennedy?\" Read the full column here.",

According to an article written by the agency's senior in-house historian, the CIA purposely held back information from the Warren Commission, Politico reports. John McCone, then the agency's director, apparently failed to tell the commission about agency plots to murder Fidel Castro (including ones involving the Mafia). So the commission never knew to ask whether Lee Harvey Oswald had Cuban comrades dead-set on retaliating against the US president. The commission famously concluded that Oswald acted alone, spawning decades of conspiracy theories involving Castro, the Mafia, the CIA, the Soviets, and even President Lyndon B. Johnson. Seems the White House nudged McCone along: He \"shared the administration\u2019s interest in avoiding disclosures about covert actions that would circumstantially implicate [the] CIA in conspiracy theories and possibly lead to calls for a tough US response against the perpetrators of the assassination,\" reads the article, which was published in a CIA internal magazine in 2013 and declassified (with 15 redactions) last fall. McCone also apparently didn't reveal that the CIA may have been communicating with Oswald before the killing, and was illegally reading his mail after he tried defecting to the Soviets in 1959. The article, by CIA historian David Robarge, calls McCone's actions \"benign\" but says the cover-up played a big role in \"undermin[ing] the credibility of the commission.\" (Click for a list of the most pervasive JFK conspiracy theories.)",

Researchers found depressed photos had darker, bluer, and more faded colors, while photos with more people in them had bluer and grayer colors. People with depression were also less likely to use filters like inkwells and italics in their photos, but healthy people used warmer tones and images with more faces. depressed people were more likely to share photos with hashtags like #sad or #love, though those hashtags weren't predictive of depression, reports Ars Technica.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Jane Austen wrote, \"To be sure, you knew no actual good of me\u2014but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love.\" But had she submitted that line to a modern English teacher, she would have gotten docked for grammar. Instead of \"when they fall in love,\" it should be \"when he falls in love,\" or perhaps the clunkier \"when he or she falls in love,\" right? That has long been the prevailing view, but after a slow and steady creep, that view seems to be disappearing. In fact, this year might be the tipping point for acceptance of the \"singular they.\" Quartz, for example, has dubbed singular they its Word of the Year. And earlier this month, the Washington Post changed its style guide to accept it, though the guide still encourages reporters to first try to write around it by recasting the sentence as plural, notes Poynter. So, \"All students must complete their homework, not Each student must complete his or her homework,\" per the guide. But when that kind of rewrite is \"impossible or hopelessly awkward,\" writers should employ the singular they. One big factor behind the shift\u2014not just at the Post but in newspapers, online posts, and English classrooms across the country\u2014is the increasing acceptance in society of those who identify as neither male nor female. The singular they solves the problem. (On a related note, the New York Times now permits \"Mx.\" as a gender-neutral honorific in place of Mr. or Ms., notes Quartz.) Grammatical purists may protest, but they are simply wrong, writes English teacher Anne Curzan at the Chronicle for Higher Education. \"There is nothing grammatically wrong with singular they other than the fact that people say there is something wrong with it,\" she writes, noting the similarity to the outdated rule, still enforced in places, about not splitting infinitives. Adds Anna Walsh at Baltimore's City Paper, \"Using language that's more accurately inclusive is something that every grammarian should be able to get behind, regardless of what pronouns they personally use.\" (The Internet seems to have invented a preposition.)",

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 If the world wants to avoid the worst of climate change, it's going to have to ease up on air travel. That's according to a study published Wednesday in Climatic Change that looked at 20 of the world's busiest airports, including New York's LaGuardia and Paris' Charles de Gaulle. The study found that on the hottest days, fuel capacities and payload weights will have to be reduced by as much as 4%, which would mean about 12 fewer passengers on an average 160-seat plane, reports the Los Angeles Times. The problem is that thinner air means less lift as a plane travels along a runway. This can cause a plane to be unable to takeoff safely. \"All the published studies have been about thing getting worse,\" an expert at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research tells the New York Times. \"Our results suggest that weight restriction may impose a non-trivial cost.\" The most affected airports in the study are in the Middle East, including Dubai and New York\u2019s LaGuardia, though London\u2019s Heathrow and Paris\u2019Charles de Gaulle were also considered safe. The researchers looked at five common commercial airplane models, including the Boeing 737-800, Airbus A320, Boeing 787-8, Boeing 777-300, and Airbus A380. They calculated how their takeoffs would be affected at 19 airports around the world based on projected temperatures from 27 different global climate models. The good news is that London, Paris, and JFK in New York will be able to shrug off future heat waves, but other sectors of the economy could suffer delays and cancellations. (Last month, dozens of flights were delayed or canceled in Las Vegas due to a heat wave.)",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Remember in June when it got too hot for planes to take off in Phoenix? A new study suggests stories like that will become quite common in the not-too-distant future. Via Reuters, the study published in Climatic Change estimates that rising temperatures could leave up to one-third of planes grounded during heat waves in the coming decades. The problem centers around the wings\u2019 capacity for lift, which is lessened in warmer conditions. By 2100, worldwide average temperatures are expected to rise by 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit. To safely take off, airlines would need to make adjustments during the hottest part of the day, with 10% to 30% of planes affected. Full flights will either stay grounded until conditions cool down or lighten their loads by removing fuel, cargo, or passengers, per a release at EurekAlert. Think 12 to 13 people asked to leave a 160-person passenger plane. \"Our results suggest that weight restriction may impose a non-trivial cost,\" one of the study\u2019s lead authors says. Wired reports that among the airports studied, New York\u2019s LaGuardia and Washington\u2019s Reagan-National fared poorly because of short runways, as did Dubai International Airport, where extreme heat could force reduced loads up to 55% of the time during peak temperatures. Better news: New York's JFK wouldn't be much affected. Delayed departures won't be the only hassle. Scientists say severe turbulence would become more common. \u201cI\u2019ve yet to see a benefit of climate change to aviation,\u201d says atmospheric scientist Paul Williams, who believes it\u2019s high time for the airline industry to prepare and adapt.

The tank that held the water, which had melted away in the wake of the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, was taken out by workers on Sunday, the first time since the disaster that the tanks have been removed. Experts believe it will take up to a decade to remove all of the contaminated water from the tank, which is believed to hold around 10% of the total radiation water at the plant. The Guardian reports that a \"crucial stage\" in the decommissioning of the plant began Tuesday, with workers beginning to remove protective covers from one of the reactors. The covers were designed to stop radioactive materials from escaping, and workers hope to remove them by the end of next year. They plan to start extracting spent fuel rods from the reactor in 2020. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of Fukushima evacuees are still living in temporary housing\u2014and taxpayers are footing the bill. The government and Tokyo Electric Power Co., or Tepco, have agreed to increase compensation payments to $57.18 billion.

The panel was led by Robert Kennedy Jr., chairman of the World Mercury Project. According to BuzzFeed News, Kennedy believes journalists are working with the CDC to bury the truth about a vaccine ingredient called thimerosal causing autism in children, and he offered a $100,000 reward to anyone who can produce a study that finds vaccines with the ingredient are safe for kids and pregnant women. De Niro, who was mostly quiet during the panel, did speak up to say he agrees with Kennedy \"100%.\" Science, on the other hand, does not. Doctors, medical organizations, and the CDC say Kennedy's beliefs are unequivocally false. The director of a vaccine education center says seven studies published between 2000 and 2007 alone show that. Furthermore, thimerosal hasn't been used in children's vaccines since 1999 and is barely used in flu vaccines anymore, but autism rates are rising anyway, notes BuzzFeed.

In a New England Journal of Medicine study, researchers found that patients whose ER doctors are more likely to prescribe opioids are more likely to develop an addiction compared to the patients of ER doctors who prescribe less frequently. It may sound like an obvious chain of events, but it remains unclear why two patients given the same opioid prescription after similar complaints have different addiction risks depending on their ER doc. The takeaway is \"not that high-intensity prescribers are necessarily irresponsible in prescribing opioids to certain patients,\" the lead author tells the New York Times. But \"their patients have worse outcomes that we weren\u2019t aware of before.\" After tracking 375,000 Medicare patients in ERs between 2008 and 2011, researchers found that one in every 48 patients prescribed opioids ends up using them long-term, or more than half a year. But when comparing \"high-intensity\" prescribing docs (who gave opioids to one in four patients) to \"low-intensity\" prescribers (one in 14), patients of the first group had a 30% greater risk of turning into long-time users. It may be a simple numbers game, as observed in a post at Pacific Standard: \"The more prescriptions doctors give out, the more likely they'll end up handing a script to someone who will have a serious problem later.\" But one doctor sees a larger issue: Among ER doctors, there's no consensus \"about when to prescribe opioids and what dose to give.\" (This is how long it takes to become dependent.)",

Chief Justice John Roberts administered the oath of office, followed by shouts of \"USA,\" reports NBC News. It was the first time a sitting president had taken the oath in front of a joint session of Congress, notes the New York Times. Trump will deliver his first inaugural address at noon. Here's what you need to know about the day and what to watch for in the speech: Will he try to unite the country? The speech should be a chance for Trump to do just that, but it's also a chance to appeal to skeptical voters. \"His instruction to me was: The campaign is over. I am now president for all the people. I want you to build a bridge and tie them back in.\" Will he use the speech to set the tone for his presidency? Experts tell NBC that Trump has a style of speech that can work in his favor, but that just means he hammers home a \"compelling and convincing message\" with it.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The US begins its journey into uncharted territory Friday when Donald Trump takes political office for the first time in his life\u2014starting at the top. He will deliver his inaugural address at 11:51am, according to the AP's timeline, and analysts say it will be one of the most closely watched in history. Advisers say that, like many predecessors, Trump will issue a call for unity and give his vision of \"one America.\" Experts tell NBC News that Trump's unique and repetitive speaking style will drive the message home and maybe even go a little way toward unifying America. \"If I keep saying it, it becomes it,\" says New York University neuroscience professor David Poeppel. In other coverage: The Los Angeles Times reports that Trump has said he looked to the speeches of Ronald Reagan, John F. Kennedy, and Richard Nixon to prepare\u2014and of the three, Nixon might be most relevant. After winning with a minority of the popular vote in the deeply divisive 1968 election, Nixon called on the \"better angels of our nature\" in his inaugural address, saying America had heard too much inflated and bombastic rhetoric. \"We cannot learn from one another until we stop shouting at one another,\" he said. The San Francisco Chronicle lists five things to look for in Trump's address, including efforts to reassure foreign leaders. Ad-libs are also a strong possibility, though analysts say trying to wing it could be a big mistake. The speech was largely written by incoming senior White House adviser Stephen Miller, Politico reports in its guide to inaugural events, which includes viewing tips and the order of the ceremony. The Washington Post looks at the many demonstrations that will be taking place across the capital on Friday, including a few pro-Trump events, as well as numerous \"counterinaugural\" protests. The \"Let America Hear Us, Roar for Trump\" group will be sharing Dupont Circle with a pro-marijuana group that plans to hand out 4,200 joints. Time takes a look back at every Inauguration Day in US history, and at what every president had to say on the occasion. The Times of London reports on the \"security nightmare\" posed by Trump's first ride in the presidential limousine, which will take him past tens of thousands of people between the Capitol and the White House. Many will be watching to see whether he chooses to walk part of the way as predecessors including Obama did. The New York Times speaks to five Trump voters from very different backgrounds to find out why they traveled to DC for the inauguration. Protests are taking place in cities across the world, but in Melania Trump's hometown in Slovenia, they're getting ready for a huge party, TMZ reports.

The mice were likely introduced in 1893 by a seal hunting gang or a ship wreck. In 2014, New Zealand launched the \"Million Dollar Mouse\" project to raise funds to eradicate the islands of mice. The New Zealand public kicked in $250,000, WWF NZ provided another $100,000, and Gareth Morgan, a New Zealand man, matched donations dollar for dollar.

Both Radio New Zealand and NPR note the mice originally found their way to the Antipodes either on 19th-century ships or via a shipwreck and proceeded to purge the island of at least two insect species, as well as to displace some seabirds to other islands. The initiative in the Antipodes isn't a stand-alone: The island nation has also gotten rid of other invasive species in the name of boosting biodiversity, including goats, rats, cats, rabbits, and a local meat-eating weasel.

As for the airstrikes, targeted ones may be necessary near the mountain to \"break the siege\" there, says Obama, and allow more help to arrive and avert a \"genocide.\" The bigger reason for the possible airstrikes, however, seems to be to halt the advance of the extremist fighters in the north.

Lee and Felicia Schwartz at the Wall Street Journal. \"It also puts a spotlight on what has become a familiar feature of the Obama presidency, in which the leader of the most powerful military in the world has become defined by his reluctance to use it.\" Unity after all? \"Ironically, ISIS's campaign against the Kurds may end up helping unify the Iraqi state,\" writes Joshua Keating at Slate.

The lawsuit accuses Nuala of controlling Barton's earnings while only giving Barton an occasional \"allowance,\" and even of lying about her earnings for one movie \"so that she could pocket the difference\u2014on top of her hefty management fee\u2014all without Barton's knowledge.\" According to the Los Angeles Times, Barton's suit says she entered into a verbal contract with her mom when she was 8; her mom was to get 10% of her gross earnings. In 2006, when Barton was 20, she claims her mother convinced her to buy a $7.8 million home in Beverly Hills as an investment vehicle ... but that Nuala and Barton's dad now live in the home, where Barton is \"not welcome.\" There are myriad additional accusations surrounding forged signatures, a handbag line, a fashion boutique, and endorsement contracts, along with allegations of \"bullying and verbal abuse.\" As TMZ notes, the lawsuit gets decidedly personal: Barton says neither of her parents have had a job other than managing her for more than 10 years, and they both \"sit back expecting their daughter's hard work and dedication to her craft to support their lifestyle.\" Nuala is, as you might expect, no longer Barton's talent manager.

Researchers at the Federal University of So Paulo say they've found evidence of the virus in the brains of infants who've died from microcephaly and two miscarriages, as well as a high load of Zika virus RNA, the New York Times reports. The findings, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association's JAMA Ophthalmology, add \"strong evidence\" that the virus is responsible for the birth defects, study author Tatjana upanc says in an email. The eye problems found in more than a third of the babies they examined in December are likely related to the brain damage caused by microcephaly. \"We are concerned that these lesions are going to have an effect on vision as the babies get older,\" Northwestern University's Lee Jampol tells NBC News. \"There is a lot of testing that not been done yet.\" Jampol says the eye defects don't necessarily mean the babies will have vision problems down the road.

The study centers on a 25-year-old Slovenian woman who became pregnant while volunteering in Brazil in February 2015. She developed a high fever and rash during her 13th week of pregnancy, but ultrasounds at 14 and 20 weeks showed no issues. When she returned to Slovenia in October, however, doctors found extensive brain damage in the fetus and the pregnancy was aborted, per NBC News. An autopsy found the full genome of the Zika virus exclusively in the fetus' unusually smooth and scarred brain, suggesting the virus only attacked nerve tissue, per Reuters. The mother had no family history of genetic abnormalities and the fetus tested negative for 13 other viruses known to cause birth defects. \"You have a mother who's infected, a fetus that's abnormal, and in the fetus, you have the genetic signature of the virus,\" says an infectious disease expert. \"This is clear data showing Zika can infect the fetus.\" An epidemiologist adds \"it sounds like a pretty clear case of extreme microcephaly.\" Scientists suspect brain development may have stopped around 20 weeks, leading one doctor to suggest that Zika, like other viruses linked to birth defects, may be most dangerous in the early stages of pregnancy.

She was in my womb.\" But she says she won't hand Gammy over to his biological parents. \"Never. Not in any way,\" she tells the AP. An online campaign to raise money for him has raised more than $215,000 since last week.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Since the story of baby Gammy went viral several days ago, the Australian government has announced that it is looking into whether it can intervene in a case described by the Australian immigration minister as \"very, very murky,\" particularly because it took place in another country, reports the Telegraph. The baby, now 7 months old, was allegedly abandoned by his Australian parents, who paid a 21-year-old Thai woman to be a surrogate mother following an IVF procedure that ultimately resulted in twins. But the Australian couple says they were never told about the second baby, though surrogate Pattaramon Chanbua, a street vendor with two young children of her own, thinks they're lying about that. She says she was asked to abort Gammy but refused due to religious beliefs, and she's now raising him\u2014and she wants to raise his twin sister as well after new allegations arose against the couple who took her and left Gammy behind. Sources tell Australia's 9 News that the father is a pedophile who was jailed in the 1990s on child sex convictions; his wife says she's aware of those convictions but that her husband is a changed man. The AP also spoke to a police officer who says the man is a convicted sex offender. Child protective services is reportedly looking into the father's suitability now, and Chanbua says she'd take the baby girl she carried back. As for whether she'd turn Gammy over to the couple at this point, she says, \"Never. Not in any way.\" He's currently in the hospital with a serious lung infection and will need surgery for a heart problem, reports the Guardian. A GoFundMe campaign started by a charity has raised more than $230,000 for Gammy's care, and some have argued that Gammy should be able to access Australia's health care.

The report states insurers and Medicaid programs in 27 states limited or banned access to Sovaldi because they feared it would be too expensive to treat so many people. \"The documents show it was always Gilead's plan to max out revenue, and that accessibility and affordability were pretty much an afterthought,\" says Sen. Ron Wyden, who co-led the investigation with Sen. Chuck Grassley. Gilead responded to the report with a statement saying the price hike was \"in line with previous standards of care\" and that more than 600,000 people are treated with Sovaldi. Harvoni, a treatment that costs $94,500, was also approved for Sovaldi in December 2014 and is now the most expensive hepatitis C treatment in the world, reports the New York Times.

Gilead Sciences, the sixth richest drugmaker in the world, \"is making a fortune selling essential drugs to the very government and taxpayers that helped pay to develop them, and then dodging taxes on the resulting profits,\" says Frank Clemente, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, which issued the report this month. Gilead has avoided some $10 billion in taxes by moving assets to Ireland, where there is a lower tax rate, and then not bringing some $28.5 billion in profits back into the US. Per the Washington Post, the California-based company's revenues in 2015 hit $32.6 billion, up three times from 2012. As for the accusation of gouging: Last year, a Senate investigation found that the company \"pursued [a] profit-driven strategy\" with its hepatitis drugs, rather than making the drugs more accessible at a lower price (it had considered $50,000). As the Post notes, Gilead, which declined to comment on the report, isn't alone in looking overseas for tax relief. Plenty of other pharmaceutical and technology companies do it. Apple, for instance, has squirreled away nearly $200 billion abroad, Bloomberg reported last year. According to Citizens for Tax Justice, that's enabled the company to avoid paying $59.2 billion in US taxes. Pfizer has some $193 billion abroad, per the Post.

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Pole vaulting is a dangerous sport, and it's time to do something about it, according to a study published Wednesday in PLOS One. The study looked at 32 pole-vault injuries that were reported to the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research between 1982 and 1998. Of those, 17 (53%) involved athletes landing on the landing pad and their head on the ground; eight (25%) landed in the vault box after being stranded at the height of the jump, and five (16%) completely missed the landing pads; and a thoracic spine fracture resulted in a paraplegia. The injuries occurred in male athletes between the ages of 17 and 17.5, and 31 of them resulted in catastrophic head injuries. The most common type of injury was a traumatic brain injury, which was caused by a \"significant increase\" in the amount of force applied during the jump. The researchers recommend increasing the minimum landing pad size to 25 feet, and enforcing the rule requiring soft surfaces next to the landingpads to prevent injuries. In fact, one-third of lumbar injuries were season-ending, and the odds of injury were 2.7 times greater for vaulters with multiple prior injuries. Sixteen of the injured athletes died, and six were left with permanent disability. (The US track and field team recently made a big change to protect its athletes.)",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 If the words \"pole vaulting\" don't inspire fear in you, they should. That's the upshot of a Vice article about the sport, which succinctly expresses why: \"At 20 feet, a pole vault accident is like someone falling off the roof of their house, while running as fast at they can with a thick pole in their hands.\" If that sounds like a brush with death, it quite literally can be: A 2001 study analyzed the 32 catastrophic pole-vault injuries that were reported to the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research between 1982 and 1998; half the accidents resulted in death, and 6 in permanent disabilities. A follow-up study published in 2012 noted that one safety-related change made in 2003 was an expansion of the landing pad's minimum dimensions. In the 8 years that followed, the study noted only two of the 19 catastrophic injuries were fatal. But the rest weren't pretty: major head injuries and spine or pelvic fractures were among them. And a study of collegiate pole vaulters published this last January found 41% sustained some kind of injury, a figure that researchers saw as suggestive of the fact that \"injuries are very common in experienced vaulters.\" The injury stats aren't good, and the potential pay and fame aren't much better. So why the heck do it? Vice talked to US record-holder Brad Walker (one of 18 men to ever clear 6 meters), who sums up vaulters as \"risk-takers, usually with something to prove to themselves ... you won't find a vaulter jumping high who doesn't have at least one screw loose.\" As for why they stay with it, Vice points to its highly technical and challenging nature: As you approach the box you're a sprinter; then you're a gymnast. Walker says you need \"significant body control and spatial awareness,\" too.",

Walruses typically leave the water for two weeks after the end of summer sea ice recedes, but sea ice has been retreating earlier this year than in previous years, leading to the early gathering. The village of Point Lay, where the annual event has taken place almost every fall since 2007, is asking people to stay away from the animals to avoid causing stampedes. As many as 40,000 walruses were estimated to have gathered on the barrier islands in recent years, putting them at risk for overcrowding.

Several hundred Pacific walruses began amassing on an island off Alaska\u2019s northwest coast in the first week of August in what wildlife officials say is the earliest date yet for their annual \"haulout.\" The culprit appears to be shrinking Arctic ice. Walruses tend to head ashore two weeks after warm temperatures cause sea ice to recede too far north for them in the Chukchi Sea. This year, it happened earlier than ever. Walruses typically use sea ice for protection and as a home base, particularly for juveniles, while adults dive to the ocean floor for food. But \"when that ice retreats to the deeper water, they can't do that,\" Fish and Wildlife rep Andrea Medeiros tells Alaska Public Media. For the past several years, a barrier island near Point Lay has served as an alternative home base. Last year, thousands of walruses had arrived there by Oct. 7. This year, however, the haulout was observed beginning on Aug. 3\u2014a full two weeks ahead of the next earliest date observed back in 2011, reports Alaska Dispatch News.

Researchers at the University of Utah say they've found evidence that the book was translated as early as 1782, more than 50 years before the Mormon church was founded, reports the Deseret News. The translation\u2014which took Joseph Smith and two other scribes four years to complete\u2014was a major factor in the church's decision to split from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The earliest known account of the process dates back to the 1820s, when a Shaker in Ohio spoke of transparent stones into spectacles that \"looked on [Smith's] face into the hat & the interpretation then flowed into his mind,\" reports the Salt Lake Tribune. Heritage Auctions, which is selling the book with the help of a private donor, says it's \"one of the most important books in Christian history.\" The handwritten, 500-page book was originally published in 1642 in New York City, but it wasn't until Smith's death that it was printed on parchment and shipped to London.

The book, which Smith said he translated from \"reformed Egyptian\" with the stone, recounts a visit from Jesus Christ to North America, reports the Salt Lake Tribune. As for the translation, the church has this to say: \"Joseph placed ... the seer stone in a hat, pressed his face into the hat to block out extraneous light, and read aloud the English words that appeared on the instrument.\" It says the translation occurred over three months in 1829 as part of a \"a series of miraculous events.\" Indeed: In March, the Deseret News reported that the church says it takes roughly five years to translate and then produce the Book of Mormon in another language. The church says it is trying to make its history more \"tangible\" with the release, but Terryl Givens, professor of literature and religion at the University of Richmond, tells the AP that the church is also trying to show skeptics it has nothing to hide. \"Other churches' origins are concealed by the mist of history.

Protesters had called for a massive demonstration if China allowed open elections in 2017, but Beijing's Standing Committee of the National People's Congress said today that only two or three candidates would be allowed to run, the BBC reports. \"This is a legal, fair, and reasonable decision,\" a Chinese official says. \"It is a dignified, prudent decision, and its legal effect is beyond doubt.\" \"Today is not only the darkest day in the history of Hong Kong's democratic development, today is also the dark day of one country, two systems,\" Benny Tai, a law professor and one of Occupy Central's main leaders, tells the South China Morning Post. \"All chances of dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of Central will definitely happen.\" The movement has brought major disruption to parts of the city, but it has yet to win broad support among the city's middle class, Reuters reports.

China's legislature ruled that candidates must be backed by a nominating committee, a move that means voters are likely to have just two or three candidates to choose from\u2014all of them nominated by a pro-Beijing committee. At a protest last night, one of the pro-democracy movement's leaders called it the \"darkest day in the history of Hong Kong's democratic development\" and warned that the former British colony's people \"are no longer willing to be docile subjects,\" reports Reuters. Activists in the \"Occupy Central\" movement plan to paralyze Hong Kong's central business district to protest Beijing's decision. Analysts say Beijing feared that granting Hong Kong's demand for greater democracy would have led to similar demands on the mainland. \"In the territory controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, only Hong Kong has some space for free speech, some judicial independence, so it is a mirror for people on the mainland,\" a dissident in Beijing who was placed under house arrest ahead of the government announcement tells the New York Times. \"The outcome of this battle for democracy will also determine future battles for democracy for all of China.\" In nearby Macau, meanwhile, chief executive Fernando Chui was \"re-elected\" to another five-year term yesterday by a 400-strong pro-Beijing committee that didn't have any other candidates to choose from, the South China Morning Post reports.

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 The mysterious Bermuda Triangle in the western North Atlantic, where ships and planes mysteriously disappear, is probably not a mystery anymore, according to researchers at the Arctic University of Norway. They say they've found underwater craters off the coast of Norway that are likely the result of \"enormous blowouts of gas,\" the Telegraph reports. The gas could turn water beneath the craters into foam, which could cause ships to sink suddenly. But it's not clear whether the gas blowouts happen in the Bermuda Triangle area, or how they would make planes vanish from the sky, the Guardian notes. The theory stems from surveys of the ocean floor between Britain and continental Europe that have revealed large quantities of methane hydrates, an odorless gas found in swamps and mines. As the methane deposits rise, they become gaseous, and huge bubbles form at the surface. \u201cWhether or not the ship will sink depends on its position relative to the bubble,\u201d write the researchers in the Journal of Adolescent Health. The Bermuda Triangle has long been the subject of conspiracy theories, and now scientists say they\u2019ve found evidence to back up one of them: that oceanic gas is behind a number of shipwrecks offthe coast ofNorway. \"Multiple giant craters exist on the sea floor in an area in the west-central Barents Sea ... and are probably a cause of enormous Blowouts of Gas,\" says a press release from the European Geosciences Union. If true, it would explain why the shipwrecks occurred in the first place.",

Ice-like underwater methane can break away and form gas that bubbles to the surface, Live Science explained in 2014; Yeltsov says it erupts \"like a nuclear reaction, producing huge amounts of gas.\" Research has shown that such eruptions could sink sea vessels, as NBC News reported in 2003, and this YouTube video appears to confirm that. But it's not clear these blowouts even occur in the Bermuda Triangle, the Guardian notes. And skeptics say the Gulf Stream's many tropical storms would better account for the Triangle's lost ships and planes. The very term \"Bermuda Triangle\" is questionable: Still dismissed by the US Navy, it was invented in a dramatic 1964 article that probed the \"mysterious menace\" behind ships and airplanes lost in the area.

That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book\u2014Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\u2014has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.\u201d",

He says shooting his dog was \"so emotionally disturbing\" he still cries when he thinks about it. He buried Allie's body at a beach nearby because he says she used to like watching him surf, and he would wave to the spot when he walked by in the coming days. But a few weeks later, a passerby spotted Allie's partially buried body. Whalen was charged with animal cruelty and burying trash.

Where did it all go wrong for the Wisconsin governor? Insiders tell Politico that Walker was overconfident, and though he tried to act as his own campaign manager, he seemed to be \"making it up as he went along,\" causing plenty of strategic blunders. Fundraising dried up as Donald Trump's rise pushed him to the sidelines, leaving him with a large organization but little support. His sudden departure from the race came after he failed to make an impression at the second debate and a CNN poll found his support at well below 1%. \"He was a terrible candidate, but he also got Trump-ed,\" a source tells Politico. More: Sources tell CNN that although a super PAC supporting him had plenty of cash, Walker's campaign funds started to dry up after the first debate as donors looked elsewhere. Walker \"is a pragmatist above all else and just didn't see the path to a comeback\" after his poll numbers collapsed even in Iowa, a campaign insider says.

In a study published Wednesday in Nature, scientists used stem cells to repair damaged parts of the hearts of five macaques after they suffered heart attacks. The stem cells were created in the lab from the donor skin of a monkey who was a good genetic match for the recipient. The hope is that the heart cells will not be rejected by the immune system, but the procedure is time-consuming and expensive. Currently, patients who suffer a heart attack can receive a heart transplant, but there are not enough donors. The new study shows that using stem cells could be a much more cost-effective option. Researchers found that the stem cells replaced about 16% of the damaged tissue in the monkeys' hearts. But all five monkeys developed unusual heart rhythms after receiving the treatment. Scientists are still trying to figure out why. \u201cI think we can manage the post-transplant arrhythmia,\u201d one researcher tells the Guardian. However, another heart expert says the study is a \"significant step forward.\" Japanese researchers used a gene therapy that turns a patient's own stem cells into heart-related cells. The cells were then implanted into a patient who had already suffered a heart attacked and was suffering from abnormal heartbeats. After six months, \"this is the first time such a technique has been successfully used to treat a person with coronary heart disease,\" said the study's lead author. \"We are very excited.\" (Click to read about other new research that could help save lives.",

Or at least that's the hope after scientists successfully used lab-created heart muscle cells to partially repair damaged hearts in monkeys, Live Science reports. The healthy stem cells were easily absorbed into the damaged hearts and allowed the organ to pump blood more easily. The procedure could lead to a new way to treat heart attacks and at least partially repair heart damage, the Guardian reports. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men and women in the US. Scientists are intrigued by the idea of treating damaged hearts by using a patient's own skin cells to create healthy heart cells, which are less likely to be rejected since they don't come from a donor. In the latest study in the journal Nature, the team at Shinshu University induced heart attacks in five macaques and then injected them with heart cells made from the skin of a healthy macaque who was a close genetic match. To avoid rejection, they ensured the donor monkey had a type of protein similar to the recipients' and they gave the sick monkeys anti-rejection drugs. After studying the macaques for three months, researchers found their immune systems tolerated the new cells, which replaced about 16% of the damaged heart tissue. In the end, the monkeys' heart muscles contracted better, pumping blood more efficiently. Human trials are not coming anytime soon, though, after the macaques developed irregular heartbeats. Still, doctors said the findings raise the possibility of treating damage caused by heart attacks. \"Currently, the only long term option for these patients is heart transplantation, but there are not enough donors to meet the current demand,\" heart researcher Sam Boateng told the Guardian.

Their left hands became colder by an average of 0.4 degrees Fahrenheit, while their right hands' temperatures dropped by an average of 0.1 degrees, Real Clear Science reports. The researchers classified that temperature change as \"significant.\" Such sympathetic coldness could be an adaptive trait, says lead researcher Dr. Neil Harrison. \"Humans are profoundly social creatures, and much of humans' success results from our ability to work together in complex communities,\" he explains. \"This would be hard to do if we were not able to rapidly empathize with each other and predict one another's thoughts, feelings, and motivations.\" When the 36 subjects saw videos of people putting their hands in warm water, however, the subjects' body temperatures stayed the same\u2014perhaps because the cold was more evident than the heat in the videos, Harrison notes. The \"cold\" clips showed blocks of ice throughout, whereas the \"hot\" ones only briefly showed steam at their start. \"There is also some evidence to suggest that people may be more sensitive to others appearing cold than hot,\" he points out. Yawning is among other contagious behaviors, as Medical Daily notes\u2014and even dogs are susceptible.",

But tests by a company that authenticates bottles turned out to be anything but, reports the BBC. \"It was supposed to be the world's last unopened bottle of the 1878 Macallan single malt whisky,\" says Sandro Bernasconi, owner of the Devil's Place Whiskey Bar in St. Moritz. \"The result has been a big shock to the system and we are delighted to have repaid our customer full as a gesture of goodwill.\" Zhang Wei, a 36-year-old writer for China's top social media site, Weibo, bought the bottle from a staff member at the Waldhaus Am See hotel. He said it was a \"once in a lifetime\" chance to buy what he thought was one of the rarest Macallans in the world. The problem? It's only three or four years old, according to the founder of the Alliance Moritz Distillers. \"Nobody ever found traces of this bottle from 1878,\" he tells Whisky.com.

Eyebrows were raised about the veracity of Zhang Wei's purchase after photos were posted online of Zhang posing with the bottle and the manager of the Waldhaus Am See hotel; the Swiss hotel's Devil's Place whisky bar has a 2,500-bottle collection. The prime condition of the vintage bottle, and the wording on the label didn't add up, said doubters. They were right. The BBC reports a series of lab tests were performed and returned all-around negative results. University of Oxford researchers carbon dated the sample and say there's a 95% probability it was produced between 1970 and 1972.

Darin Bolar was arrested Sept. 26 and charged with first-degree kidnapping and two counts of second-degree rape for the 2007 attack on a 14-year- old girl who was looking for a pay phone when she noticed a man walking behind her, reports the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. According to court documents, the man grabbed the girl, pulled her into a yard, and raped her. He allegedly used a garden hose to clean the evidence of the assault and forced it in the girl's vagina to do so. They drove to a McDonald's and back to Bolar's house, where they said the girl was not allowed to leave and he would find and kill her if she did. He raped and beat the girl and forced her to clean his house throughout the next two days, police say. The girl escaped while another man at work was asleep on a couch and contacted a friend, who called police. Staff at Harborview Medical Center collected forensic evidence from the girl for her rape kit. The kit was not tested until Dec. 28, 2017, when the crime lab found a DNA profile that matched Bolar. Court documents state that Bolar lured the girl to his home, where he told her he would kill her unless she tried to find help. Police say he raped her at least seven or eight times over the course of two days.

But as the Guardian reports, her ensuing off-screen plight has been largely ignored, even though she faces more than a half-century in prison. That's because Greene, whose legal name is Charlene Egbe, isn't just a cannabis advocate but the owner of the Alaska Cannabis Club, which she created on April 20, 2014, a full six months before Alaska voted to legalize the adult use of cannabis. In other words, she was receiving \"donations\" for marijuana through club \"memberships\" before it was legal to do so. Police raided the club twice and detectives made several undercover purchases, and though Greene wasn't directly involved in them, state prosecutors are charging her because the club is registered under her name. She's pleaded not guilty to charges of \"misconduct involving a controlled substance,\" and the original indictment listed eight offenses that amounted to a possible 24 years in jail. The Guardian broke the news to Greene that six offenses have since been added, raising the total to 54 years.

That's according to a new study that found the planet had water on its surface for 1.5 billion years longer than previously believed, the Guardian reports. \"We now know Mars was wet for a much longer time than we thought before,\" says lead researcher Geronimo Villanueva of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"Now we see that Mars must have beenwet for a period even longer.\" The study\u2014based on infrared maps of Mars made over six years using three of the most powerful telescopes in the world, including the Very Large Telescope in Chile\u2014found that water molecules in Mars' atmosphere are enriched with hydrogen isotope deuterium, which is six times more common on Earth than on Mars. When normal water on Mars is lost, the heavier form is left behind, and when that happens, the amount of deuterIUM in water on Martians rises. The findings \"open the idea of an ocean covering 20% of Mars, by comparison, which opens the possibility of alien life,\" says Villanueva. If true, the findings suggest that Mars lost a third of its fresh water over 4.5 billion years, New Scientist notes. The consequences of this loss are still unknown, but if\u2014 Scientists think they've figured out how much water was on Mars four billion years ago\u2014and it turns out that the planet once had an ocean. It's not a huge surprise that water is present on Mars today.",

If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Sources say Trump asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions earlier this year if it was possible to drop the criminal case against Arpaio, but was told that would be inappropriate. After talking with Sessions, Trump decided to let the case go to trial, and he could grant clemency. So the president waited, all the while planning to issue a pardon if Arpaio was found in contempt of court for defying a federal judge's. The sources say senior White House officials, including Stephen Miller, Steve Bannon, and Dan Scavino, had been advocating for a pardon. Insiders say the White House Counsel's Office began preparing the paperwork for a presidential pardon Aug. 15 after Fox News reported Trump was \"seriously considering\" pardoning Arpaio. In an interview with the Arizona Republic, the 84-year-old former Maricopa County sheriff says Trump has repeatedly said he won't pardon Arpaio because he doesn't want to \"cause any controversy.\" Arpaio tells the Republic he wasn't surprised by the pardon. \"I didn't think it was going to happen,\" he says. \"It was a surprise to me.\"",

Another adviser tells Politico it wasn't a \"matter of if he was going to do it, it was a matter of when.\" Despite his earlier inquiry, Trump issued the pardon without telling the Justice Department, which had no comment; Politico characterizes top officials there as surprised by the move. A former Obama counsel calls it \"his backhand way of doing what he wanted to do at the front end,\" and a \"vivid demonstration of how far removed from an appropriate exercise of the pardon power this was.\" Republicans including Arizona's senators have condemned the pardon, and Paul Ryan has joined their number, reports Politico, saying via a rep that he \"does not agree with the decision.\" As for Arpaio himself, whom the Post characterizes as Trump's brother in arms in birtherism, \"I didn't ask for the pardon,\" he says. \"He wanted to do it because I think he understood what I was going through.\"",

The bank says the issues stem from a few bad eggs, who have been disciplined or fired.

Patrolman Chris Green was responding to a drug-involved call Friday night when officers blocked in a car and found white powder on the floor, seat, and shoes of the car, WKBN reports. After the car was searched, Green put on gloves and a mask to dispose of the evidence. But an hour later, while returning to the station, another officer noticed that Green had some of the powder on his shirt. \"Just out of instinct, he tried to brush it off\u2014not thinking,\" says Captain Patrick Wright. Green passed out at the station and was given Narcan. He was treated at the hospital and released Sunday. Justin Buckle, 25, and Cortez Collins, 24, have been charged with tampering with evidence. \"We changed our procedures to where we used to field test drugs. We don't do that any longer because of accidental exposures,\" says Wright.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A police officer in Ohio got a lesson the hard way on just how potent the opioid fentanyl can be. The East Liverpool department says officer Chris Green got some of the powder on his skin after a drug bust and suffered an accidental overdose, reports WFMJ. He ended up in the hospital but is OK after multiple doses of the overdose-reversal drug Narcan. Green had participated in the arrest of two men Friday night who were suspected of conducting a drug deal inside a car. When cops blocked their vehicle, police say the men began trying to dispose of the evidence, and white powder ended up all over the inside of their car. Officers donned protective gear in collecting evidence from the scene, and accounts differ on how Green got some of the powder on his skin. The best guess is that some ended up on his shirt and he wiped it off with his bare hand, reports WKBN. \"Just out of instinct, he tried to brush it off\u2014not thinking,\" says a police captain. Fentanyl can be absorbed through the skin, and Green quickly began suffering the effects. Meanwhile, Justin Buckle, 25, and Cortez Collins, 24, face drug charges after their Friday night arrests.",

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Elon Musk's plan to take Tesla private was shot down by the company's board on Friday, but the CEO says he's still talking to investors about the idea. In a blog post, Musk says he decided to make a public announcement last week because he wanted to be \"completely forthcoming\" with Tesla's largest shareholders. \"However, it wouldn't be right to share information about going private with just our largest investors without sharing the same information with all investors at the same time,\" he writes. Musk says his \"best estimate\" is that \"approximately two-thirds of shares owned by all current investors would roll over into a private Tesla.\" He adds that Saudi Arabia's $32 billion investment fund has expressed support for the plan, but details are still being worked out. Tesla shares rose 4.4% in after-hours trading Monday following a tweet from Musk saying he had secured funding to take the company private. The move came after the Wall Street Journal reported that the SEC had begun an investigation into how Musk first announced the potential deal on Twitter last week. Sources tell the New York Times that some members of the Tesla board were completely blindsided by Musk\u2019s decision to air his plan on Twitter Sunday night. Musk said he had hired two financial advisers and two legal advisers and is \"excited to work with\" them on the proposal. \"If and when a final proposal is presented, an appropriate evaluation process will be undertaken by a special committee of Tesla\u2019s board, which I understand is already in the process of being set up, together with the legal counsel it has selected,\" he wrote. \"I am confident that Tesla will deliver on its mission of making cars safe and environmentally friendly.",

Coverage: Musk's explanation: On Monday, Musk wrote in a blog that he's been in talks with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund to provide the needed money to take the company private. The post appeared to be an attempt to quell the controversy over his initial tweet, notes the New York Times, which talks to people familiar with the Saudi fund who say a deal is nowhere close. In fact, the story asserts that Musk made his initial tweet with \"little forethought.\" On Monday, Musk also tweeted that he was getting legal and financial advice on a deal from Goldman Sachs and others.",

A Clinton spokesman blames the confusion on a fact sheet provided after a press conference last week, which mentioned keyword searches. \"We simply took for granted that reading every single email came across as the most important, fundamental, and exhaustive step that was performed,\" he said in a statement to Fox. \"The fact sheet should have been clearer in stating that every email was read.\" But while the 31,830 emails appear to be gone forever, it doesn't look like the controversy for Clinton is going to go away anytime soon. House Speaker John Boehner plans to announce a new probe this week into Clinton's email use, including the deletions, according to ABC News, which cites \"top House Republicans.\" And it's not just Clinton's emails that are gone: The State Department has admitted that routine archiving of the inboxes of senior officials only began last month. \"It's very troubling,\" a spokesman for the National Security Archive group tells Politico. \"People in the community of record-keepers and historians had known that our history was at risk for a long time.\"",

Secretary of State Michele Reagan on Monday certified results from 15 of the state's 15 counties, and they show that Trump beat Hillary Clinton by 50.5% to 48.9%, reports the Arizona Republic. The certification doesn't necessarily mean that any challenge to the results is imminent, but it opens a five-day window in which any potential challenges can be heard in court. A lawyer for Bernie Sanders last week said that there was evidence that an unknown number of voters had their ballots thrown out because of problems with voter rolls. \"What's at stake are delegates,\" says attorney Chris Sautter. \"Obviously, the outcome of the election for the primary is not going to be changed, but delegate counts could be changed.\" As the AP reports, some voters were forced to linger until 1am because of a steep cutback in polling places. Maricopa County, with its 2 million registered voters, had 200 polling places in the 2012 presidential primary and 400 in 2008. The last polling place closed at 12:58am, meaning the final voters had to wait nearly six hours.",

The DoJ's civil rights division penned a letter Friday asking Maricopa County, the state's most populous, to determine if federal law was violated regarding, among other things, the number and location of polling sites (the county cut them from 200 to 60 in 2012 in an apparent bid to save money). The Justice Department's reason for this request: reports of \"disproportional burden in waiting times \u2026 in some areas with substantial racial or language minority populations,\" the letter noted. Those waiting times were incredibly inconvenient: The AP notes that some voters waited nearly six hours, with the last vote cast at almost 1am at one site; polls had closed at 7pm, but voters already in line at that point were allowed to cast ballots. Poll workers even reportedly brought pizza to hungry voters. Maricopa County has until April 22 to respond to the DoJ's letter, which included 10 specific requests for information, including polling locations, procedures, and response to public backlash, the Arizona Republic reports. \"We are going to gather the information \u2026 and we will make it public,\" the county elections director says.

The hepgV-1 virus, or HHpgV-1, was found in the livers of healthy people and in the blood of those who had liver transplants, according to a study published Wednesday in Nature. It's unclear whether the virus causes disease in humans, but \"it looks like it might be responsible for at least some of the diseases that we see in animals,\" says study co-author Rahul Kapoor. He says the virus could also be behind strokes and autoimmune diseases such as arthritis. Researchers are still trying to figure out how the virus spreads and whether it plays any role in other diseases. \"I'm not really worried about this particular virus,\" an infectious disease expert tells NBC News. \"This is not SARS.

Little else is known about human hepegivirus-1, or HHpgV-1, besides that it looks a bit like hepatitis C and the harmless and perhaps beneficial human pegivirus. \"It is the first transfusion-associated virus that's been described in a long time,\" a researcher tells NBC News. He adds \"we don't know if it is going to be a significant cause of human hepatitis,\" but scientists say it's unlikely. In fact, \"it may be good for you.\" They first found the virus in blood samples from two volunteers, part of a study of 46, who received blood transfusions to treat hemophilia between 1974 and 1980. The virus only appeared after transfusions, but both patients cleared it and showed no sign of disease. Two more cases were found among 106 who'd received plasma, per mBio; both cleared the virus, though one was infected for five years. Even if the virus is harmful, researchers say there's no need to panic. \"This is not SARS. This is not MERS. This is not HIV,\" says an expert. Whereas blood transfusions were once performed solely with human blood products, they now use genetically engineered products. Plus, blood is screened more carefully and stricter policies better control who donates blood compared to 25 years ago. \"Does it cause trouble that would justify any response with blood safety? I don\u2019t think we're at that level,\" a pathologist at the Blood Systems Research Institute tells Science. Scientists have yet to isolate the virus but say the next step is to develop an antibody test to find HHpgV-1 in a larger population. Afterward, experts can determine whether those with HHpgV-1 antibodies appear less healthy than those without the virus and look for links to disease.

The only survivor was the children's mother, who jumped out of a second-floor window Sunday night, according to Youngstown Fire Capt. Kurt Wright. The other three children who died were ages 9, 3, and 2, he said. Investigators were just beginning to search for a cause of the fire, per the AP. Officials said so far, nothing indicates the fire was suspicious. Deborah Rivera, who lives across the street, told the Vindicator she heard a loud boom and called 911. Her boyfriend said flames were shooting out of the first-floor windows. Neighbors told WFMJ the family moved into the house about six months ago. The two-story wood home was built more than 90 years ago. \"We have a relatively young department and most [of] the guys have children,\" said Youngstown Fire Chief Barry Finley. \"So it hits pretty hard, and the fact that it's so close to Christmas hits even harder.\" Firefighters found flames throughout the home's first floor when they arrived and were able to pull out three of the children, but they died at a hospital, Wright said.

The devices\u2014which were discovered by two men who found the backpack on top of a garbage can outside a restaurant near the Elizabeth station\u2014will be closely examined for evidence linking them to explosive devices found in New York City and elsewhere in New Jersey over the weekend. A round-up of coverage: Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage says the two men thought the backpack held something of value and carried it some distance before realizing it held explosive devices and calling police, NJ.com. He says in its original location near a pub, the devices could have caused carnage. \"If that pub was crowded and there was a lot of people there, it could have severely injured, killed and maimed many, many people,\" the mayor says.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The fight for the Alabama Senate seat previously vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions looks poised to go to a Sept. 26 runoff election. But the path there officially kicks off Tuesday with a special election primary in which three candidates will be weeded down to two. President Trump and Mitch McConnell are backing former Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange, who was temporarily appointed to the seat after Sessions left it. But it's former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore who's the apparent front-runner, with Strange and US Rep. Mo Brooks trailing behind, reports Politico. More: A candidate needs 50% of the vote to take the seat, which most news outlets agree is unlikely to happen. Moore leads in some polls at around 35% support, with Strange and Brooks in a close race for second. Should Trump's favorite be eliminated, it \"will call into question the influence of Trump's support in a reliably Republican state,\" per Politico. Not that Trump should be too disappointed with Brooks or Moore. Both are \"Trumpian candidates,\" reports Axios. McConnell has a huge interest in the race, though. He and his allies have invested millions in Strange's campaign. Also key: Brooks has said he wants McConnell \"fired.\" Not helping Brooks, however, is a controversial campaign ad he aired that included audio from the shooting of Steve Scalise, reports NBC News. Strange is likewise plagued by his appointment by former Gov. Robert Bentley in what some suspect was \"a corrupt bargain to end the state's criminal investigation of Bentley,\" the New Republic previously reported. Reuters mentions the candidates' stances on issues like gay marriage and illegal immigration. The winner of the runoff election is likely to face one of two Democrats in December: either former US Attorney Doug Jones, backed by Joe Biden, or Robert Kennedy Jr., a Navy veteran with no relation to the famous Kennedy family, per Politico. Either way, the Republican winner will be sitting pretty. Alabama hasn't elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1992, per the New York Times. Polls close at 8pm EDT.",

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 An Australian rodent last seen in captivity in 2006 has been \"virtually wiped out\" by climate change, according to a study published Wednesday in the Journal of Mammalogy. The Bramble Cay melomys, or rat rat rat, was discovered in 1845 by Europeans who shot \"large rats\" for sport, Phys.org reports. The last known sighting was in 2009. Researchers believe the species went extinct because of habitat loss caused by rising sea levels and extreme weather events. The study states \"almost certainly\" ocean inundation of the low-lying cay in Australia's Great Barrier Reef over the past decade was the \"root cause\" of the rodent's extinction. \"The animals were literally dying out,\" study co-author Rowan Atkinson says in a press release. \"We knew they were going extinct, but we didn't know how.\" Researchers found only 10 or 12 of the animals on Bramble Cay in the 1970s. In 2002, 2004, there were as many as 1,000 of them. In 2011, and 2014, none were found at all. The animals appeared to be inbred, hunted by indigenous people who visited from Papua New Guinea on a regular basis, and killed by domestic dogs released. Researchers placed 150 traps on the island for six nights, but found no evidence of the rat rat. \"This is one of the first times that climate change has been directly linked ... to ... a species extinction,\" study author Ian Gynther tells the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. \"It's only one species of marsupial, which is the only only the only officially extinct.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Way to go, humanity. For the first time in history, human-induced climate change has been found \"solely or primarily\" responsible for the extinction of a mammal species, according to a new study. The Bramble Cay melomys, or mosaic-tailed rat, was found by Europeans on a tiny coral cay off the coast of Queensland, Australia, in 1845 and became known as the only mammal species endemic to the Great Barrier Reef, reports the Guardian. But though there were hundreds still in existence on Bramble Cay in 1978, the last were spotted by a fisherman in 2009, reports AFP. Researchers from the University of Queensland and the Queensland government\u2014who traveled to Bramble Cay in 2014 and laid 150 traps for six nights to no avail\u2014say \"the only known population of this rodent is now extinct.\" Researchers found the cay, which sits about 10 feet above sea level, had flooded several times, wiping out the animals and their habitat. Just 2.5 hectares of land remained above high tide, reports Newsweek. \"Significantly, this probably represents the first recorded mammalian extinction due to anthropogenic climate change,\" the researchers say\u2014though they hope the animals reached the island on debris from Papua New Guinea and still survive there. Researchers say extreme weather was a factor in the extinction of the Little Swan Island hutia, a rodent once found on an atoll off Honduras, but cats were also to blame. \"If this is one of the first\" extinctions solely linked to humans, \"it is more than likely not going to be the last,\" says an ecologist. \"Species restricted to small, low lying islands, or those with very tight environmental requirements are likely to be the first to go.\" (Five islands have already vanished.)",

A federal judge in Los Angeles on Friday granted a request from Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, to delay the case for 90 days while the criminal investigation into Cohen and Trump play out, CNBC reports. The delay will allow Cohen to invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in the case, which centers around a nondisclosure agreement Daniels signed before the 2016 election. Cohen says he paid Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet about a 2006 sexual encounter she says she had with Trump. On Wednesday, Cohen said he would do so because of the \"ongoing criminal investigation.\" The FBI raided Cohen's office earlier this month and seized documents related to the payment. In his ruling Friday, US District Court Judge S. James Otero found that the same facts could be at issue in both the civil and criminal cases. He also acknowledged that there might be complications from the overlap. \"It is an investigation into the personal attorney of a sitting president regarding documents that might be subject to the attorney-client privilege,\" Otero wrote. \"Whether or not an indictment is forthcoming, and the court thinks it likely based on these facts alone, these unique circumstances counsel in favor of stay.\" Daniels' attorney, Michael Avenatti, said she planned to file an appeal early next week.",

A federal judge agrees in the case of Michael Cohen, approving on Friday a 90-day stay in the civil lawsuit against him and President Trump by Stephanie Clifford (aka porn star Stormy Daniels), the Washington Post reports. The reasoning: Trump's personal lawyer filed a declaration this week noting he intends to plead the Fifth in the Daniels case, as he fears answering questions in that matter could potentially implicate himself in the criminal probe against him in New York, per NPR. FBI agents working on the latter investigation carried out a raid on Cohen's home and office in early April, and because part of that mission was to seek documents related to Daniels' nondisclosure agreement, there may be \"large potential factual overlap\" with Daniels' civil case, per Otero. \"This is no simple criminal investigation,\" Otero noted Friday. \"Whether or not an indictment is forthcoming, and the Court thinks it likely based on these facts alone, these unique circumstances counsel in favor of stay.\" Daniels' lawyer, Michael Avenatti, responded to Otero's ruling on Twitter, tweeting: \"While we certainly respect Judge Otero's 90 day stay order based on Mr. Cohen's pleading of the 5th, we do not agree with it. We will likely be filing an immediate appeal to the Ninth Circuit early next week. Justice delayed is justice denied.\" He added to the New York Times that \"we want to get the truth to the American people as quickly as possible.\" The Post, however, notes it's not unusual for those facing both civil and criminal issues to do exactly what Cohen's doing to avoid incrimination.

The man then rolled under an electrified wire to safety. \"The tiger did nothing wrong,\" said the zoo's director. \"When someone is determined to do something harmful to themselves it's very hard to stop that.\" The New York Post and others have identified the victim as David Villalobos and note that his Facebook page shows that he's an animal lover.

Now, for the first time, they know when and how it was the earliest animal ever found. In a study published in Science, researchers from Australia's Australian National University say Dickinsonia lived 558 million years ago\u2014millions of years earlier than previously thought\u2014before the \"Cambrian explosion\" that formed the basis of modern animal life. \"The fossil fat molecules that we've found prove that animals were large and abundant 558 millions years ago,\" says lead researcher Associate Professor Jochen Brocks. \"Scientists have been fighting for more than 75 years over what Dickinsonia and other bizarre fossils of the Edicaran Biota were: giant single-celled amoeba, lichen, failed experiments of evolution, or the earliest animals on Earth,\" says one of the researchers. The discovery of cholesterol in a Dickinsonia fossil so well preserved that it still held organic matter has allowed researchers to study molecules in the fossil that would normally be studied, reports Phys.org. \"I took a helicopter to reach this very remote part of the world\u2014home to bears,\" says another researcher.",

It's one of a group of lifeforms called the Ediacaran biota, which the BBC describes as the \"first complex multi-cellular organisms to appear on Earth.\" But for decades they've defied definitive classification, with scientists suggesting they could be everything from lichen to giant single-celled amoeba to \"evolutionary dead-ends.\" Now, an answer: Dickinsonia is an animal that dates back 558 million years, making it the earliest confirmed one in the geological record. That conclusion comes thanks to fat, reports Phys.org. Ilya Bobrovskiy of Australian National University discovered a Dickinsonia fossil in 300-foot-high cliffs along the White Sea in northwest Russia, in a place so remote she reached it via helicopter. The fossil was superbly preserved, so much so that its tissue had cholesterol molecules present in it. \"The fossil fat molecules that we've found prove that animals were large and abundant 558 million years ago, millions of years earlier than previously thought,\" says ANU professor Jochen Brocks, co-author of the paper on the discovery, which was published in Science.

If North Korea feels threatened to the point of using a nuclear weapon, a first target would likely be a US military base in Japan; North Korea would then use its long-range nukes to threaten the US mainland and avoid a retaliatory strike.

In other developments: Timothy Vail was the last man to escape from a New York prison, according to the New York Daily News, and he says he hopes Matt and Sweat can avoid capture. He tells the Daily News that he hopes they \"stay out of sight and don't commit any new crimes.\" Vail, who raped and murdered a pregnant woman in 1988, injured himself while escaping from the Elmira Correctional Facility in 2003 and was recaptured within two days after he and a fellow fugitive stole a van. Police officers who've dealt with Matt say he is the most evil criminal they've encountered, and he was trouble from a very early age, the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle reports. The former chief of police in North Tonawanda, near where Matt grew up, says he's around the same age as the 48-year-old and that long before Matt's first arrest, he had a \"fearsome\" reputation and was known for terrorizing other kids on the school bus. An officer in Tonawanda tells the paper that in 1986\u201411 years before his arrest for a gruesome local murder\u2014Matt broke out of a correctional facility and was recaptured a few days later. Early reports described the pair as among the first to escape in the Clinton Correctional Facility's long history, but dozens of men have made it out in various ways since the forbidding Dannemora, NY, institution opened in 1845, the New York Times reports. In 1860, a fraudster known as the \"Gay Deceiver\" put on civilian clothes, strolled out the gate, and wasn't recaptured for a year. A history professor tells the Times that the first escapes happened just weeks after the prison opened. The reform-minded warden decided not to punish the two men after they were recaptured, the professor says, but it wasn't long before a new warden installed a dungeon for solitary confinement, where punishments included waterboarding.",

Researchers looked at the health records of more than 5,200 pregnant women and found that those who ate the most baked, boiled, mashed, or French fries had a 15% higher chance of developing gestational diabetes mellitus, the New York Times reports. That's similar to the results of previous studies showing a link between potato consumption and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes in later life. \"This is the first time we've seen this association,\" says the lead author of the study, published in the British Medical Journal. \"What we do know is\u2014Women who eat an awful lot of potato are more likely to develop gestational diabetes.\" The reason isn't clear, but researchers say potatoes have a high glycemic index, which is linked to a spike in blood glucose levels after eating them, CBS News reports. \"Potatoes elevate blood sugar in people more than just about any other type of food,\" says one doctor. \"They are carbohydrates, and all carbohydrates have that potential.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 If your short-term plan involves getting pregnant, your immediate plan should potentially be to lay off the potatoes. So suggests a National Institutes of Health study published Tuesday in the BMJ that found women who eat more potatoes before becoming pregnant may be more likely to develop gestational diabetes as compared to their spud-light counterparts. That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap. The researchers estimate that trading two servings of potatoes weekly for a substitute vegetable, legumes, or whole-grain food would reduce the risk of gestational diabetes\u2014which CBS reports affects as many as 8% of pregnancies\u2014by 9% to 12%. As for why women should care, Zhang tells the BBC that women with gestational diabetes can develop pre-eclampsia and hypertension, which \"can adversely affect the fetus\" and put the mother at higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. The team notes, however, that the study shows correlation, not causation, and says more research is needed. (One country has told its women not to get pregnant right now.)",

Researchers studying the auditory cortex of a species of short-haired mustached bat found that the same part of the brain processes time-related variables like frequency and time repetition, reports Science. The left and right hemispheres of the bat's auditory cortex work in tandem to make certain sounds sound like each other. This is important because, as the New York Times explains, \"a lack of such temporal resolution, either by congenital defect or neurological damage, would render most consonant sounds indistinguishable and thus most spoken languages incomprehensible.\" \"We were surprised to find that there is such a wide range of responses to simple echolocation calls,\" says Vinod Menon, a co-author of the study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \"It's like having two set of eyes. You have one for vision and onefor hearing.\" Researchers say the \"sex-dependent\" differences in brain hemispheres in mustached bats are likely the result of \"powerful ethological pressures\" related to hunting and socializing. In humans and songbirds, similar sex differences have been linked to a desire to be socially isolated. The finding could shed light on how bats communicate, as well as help us understand other mammals that use vocalizations to communicate.",

Turns out we're not as special as we thought. A type of bat also displays this hemispheric specialization when it comes to sound processing, Washington has discovered. In both humans and Parnell's mustached bats\u2014a species that lives in an area ranging from Mexico to Brazil, RedOrbit reports\u2014the left hemisphere handles quicker sounds, while the right deals with slower ones, a press release reports. For humans, the right hemisphere \"may allow us to identify who is speaking, to gauge their emotional state via tone of voice, and to tease out pitch in music,\" Washington notes. As for the left hemisphere, \"men largely use just the left hemisphere\" to process language, while women use both hemispheres to do so, Washington says. In mustached bats\u2014named based on the hair springing from the sides of their snouts, Animal Diversity Web explains\u2014the right hemisphere's slower processing is used for sonar, \"which relies on detecting small changes in frequency,\" says Washington, senior author of the study in Frontiers in Neuroscience. The left is used \"to distinguish communication sounds from each other, because (the bats') communication sounds have rapid changes in frequency.\" All this is more than just a matter of interest: The findings could help study human language disorders, especially since some study techniques \"can only be permitted in animals,\" Washington adds.

I'm going for a swim.\" What he didn't know then that he knows now: Some 275 people have died at the dam over the last decade, and no one has successfully made it across the full width of the Colorado River there. But he apparently had luck on his side: Only one of the 10 hydroelectric turbines were powered on during his swim. \"I swam from Arizona to Nevada,\" he tells the Post. \"I went across first and then swam back. ... It took about 30 minutes to do. Even though I was knackered half way across I knew I had to get to the other side.\" He reportedly told the Sun that he was about 160 feet from the dam and felt a strong tug. \"I was sucked towards the wall and had to swim hard.\" He says police were waiting for him and handcuffed him for what he didn't realize wasn't permitted, as he says there aren't any \"no swimming\" signs posted. \"You're just expected not to.\" He says he ended up getting fined about $330, but, as the tattoo on his body reads, per the Times of London: \"No regrets.\" (This bachelor party ended up being a scam.)",

Many of the people who have racked up nearly 3 million views of the video that shows Detective Jeff Payne arresting University of Utah Hospital nurse Alex Wubbels would likely agree. Gill on Friday called for a criminal investigation into the encounter, in which Payne handcuffed a screaming Wubbels after she refused to permit a blood draw from an unconscious patient\u2014as she was right to do, according to law, because Payne had neither a warrant nor the consent of the patient, who was not under arrest. The Salt Lake Tribune reports Payne was put on administrative leave Friday afternoon, along with a second unnamed officer connected to the July 26 incident. More: Mayor Jackie Biskupski and Chief Mike Brown both called Wubbels to apologize. Per the city, the Unified Police Department will begin a criminal probe into the matter, and an internal affairs investigation will be conduced as well. The Tribune also offers more background on the patient in question: William Gray, a 43-year-old who was driving a semi when a 26-year-old who was trying to evade the Utah Highway Patrol crashed into Gray head-on. That driver was killed, and a police official explains it's typical to get blood draws of those involved in fatal crashes, even if they aren't suspected of wrongdoing. The AP cites Payne's police report, in which he wrote he was trying to avoid a \"scene\" by taking Wubbels outside and that this his boss told him to arrest her if she didn't cooperate with the draw. Wubbels' attorney says the nurse was left in a hot police car for 20 minutes before the detective realized the hospital had already drawn the patient's blood as part of treatment. The Tribune notes that while the video may suggest Payne was demanding Wubbels draw Gray's blood, Payne is actually one of a handful of officers certified to draw blood in accident cases, and was looking to draw the blood himself.",

The Telegraph reports the extinction of mammals, birds, and amphibians has happened up to 100 times faster than the normal rate during the past six mass extinctions\u2014the most recent being the Permian mass extinction 66 million years ago. Humans are responsible for the loss of 77 mammal species, 140 bird species, and 34 amphibians. \"This is very depressing because we used the most conservative rates, and even then they are much higher than the regular extinction rate, really indicating we are having a massive loss of the species,\" Dr. Gerardo Ceballos of the National Autonomous University of Mexico tells the Guardian. The study looked only at species that had been declared extinct, meaning it could take years after a species to return to existence. \"These estimates reveal an exceptionally rapid loss of biodiversity over the last few centuries, indicating that a sixth mass extinction is already under way,\" the study's lead author says in a press release. If current trends continue, 1,508 vertebrate species could go extinct in the next 100 years, and another 4,400 by the end of the century, say researchers from Stanford, the Smithsonian, and elsewhere. That's about 2.3% of the world's vertebrate species, or about the same as the rate at which all other animal and plant species have gone extinct. \"The particularly high losses in the last several decades accentuate the increasing severity of the modern extinction crisis,\" says Ehrlich, who was not involved in the study.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Feeling upbeat? Enough of that: Planet Earth is undergoing a sixth mass extinction that will likely annihilate the human race unless we can curb the trend, scientists say. According to a new paper, the current rate of species extinction outpaces the natural rate far more than anyone knew, NBC News reports. The analysis \"employed better knowledge\" of Earth's natural extinction rate, the Guardian reports, upping the number from one extinction per million species annually to two extinctions. It then compared that to a current extinction rate that study authors consider conservative. Presto, they got a rate since 1900 that's eight to 100 times worse than the natural one. \"We were very surprised to see how bad it is,\" says study leader Gerardo Ceballos. \"This is very depressing.\" \"If it is allowed to continue, life would take millions of years to recover, and our species itself would disappear early on,\" says Ceballos. But nations can reverse the crisis\u2014which has been linked to deforestation, industrialization, and other human factors\u2014by conserving threatened species and lowering pressures on their populations, the paper says.

The jet, which is scheduled to fly for the first time from Doha, Qatar, to Los Angeles later this month, is designed to make the trip across time zones easier and more comfortable for passengers, Business Insider reports. Among other things, the A350 is 20% bigger than its predecessors, 10% wider, 50% carbon fiber-reinforced plastic, and features LED lights that change color to reflect the sun's natural glow. It's also pressurized to 6,000 feet, so passengers have more room to move around. The plane's flaps follow the flight path, which reduces drag and noise and makes the ride smoother. It also features a filter that changes the air every two to three minutes to keep stale air from entering the cabin. The A350's interior is also designed to be adaptable so that carriers can swap out seats and configuration much more easily than in the past. \"There's an open architecture that can evolve to welcome new functions and can cope with the evolution of technology,\" an Airbus engineer tells Popular Mechanics.",

Airbus is making the bold claim that it can at least reduce the malady for those aboard its new A350 XWB line of jets. The main tool is a set of LED lights within the cabin that mimics natural shifts in sunlight and theoretically keeps people's natural circadian rhythms in sync, reports Fast Company. Another factor: Because of the planes' relatively light frames, they can be pressurized to 6,000 feet, which the airline says allows for more humidity and makes the air pressure inside the aircraft closer to the pressure on the ground than is the case with most jets, per Quartz. A third factor is the jet's filtration system, which replaces the air in the cabin in its entirety every two to three minutes. The idea there is that, if nothing else, the improved air quality should help people sleep better on long flights. And the big question: Has it worked? It's a little too early to tell.

Gibson fled but his apparent companion \"stumbled\u2014or someone tripped him\u2014and then four or five people surrounded him and began to kick and hit him,\" Letson says. When he noticed \"a whole mass of people coming,\" Letson says he intervened in fear for the man's life.

BP has tried applying chemicals underwater to break up the oil before it reaches the surface. That has never before been attempted at such depths. \"Right now there is a headlong rush to get this oil out of sight out of mind,\" a marine expert tells the AP. \"You can throw every resource we have at this spill.

James Tumblin, who used to work at Universal Studios, says he came across the dress while doing research at a costume company in the early 1960s. \"I saw this dress on the floor and a docent told me not to bother to pick it up, because they were throwing it away,\" he says, per the Telegraph. Tumblin asked if he could sell it and was told to keep it. He bought it for $20 after noticing a label on the back that said Selznick International Pictures and \"Scarlett production dress\" was written in ink. Other standout items included a straw hat worn by Leigh in a number of scenes in the movie and a gray wool suit worn by Clark Gable as his character, Rhett Butler.

Police haven't said how or when the women were killed, but they suspect foul play. Runions was last spotted getting into a car with Kopetsky at a gas station in May of that year. She was reported missing two months later when her boyfriend didn't pick her up from school. \"I don't think I could get through this without them and my family and friends,\" says Runion's mother. \"It's the hardest thing anybody would have to go through.\"",

Kara Kopetsky was last seen in 2007; Jessica Runions disappeared last September. Neither woman's body has ever been found. The first skull was discovered by a mushroom hunter Monday in a wooded area of Cass County. According to WDAF, authorities found the second skull Tuesday while searching the area. A number of other bones have also been found. While the families of Kopetsky and Runions were notified, neither of the skulls has been identified yet, KMBC reports. It's unclear how long it could take to get an identification. The families of the missing women are hopeful the remains will soon provide some answers. \"Even if it\u2019s not Kara, it\u2019s someone\u2019s loved one and someone has answers,\u201d Kopetsky's mother tells the Star. \u201cGood or bad, someone has answers.\u201d Runions' family has been searching regularly since her disappearance.

Yust has been charged with burning her car after it was later found. Yust had dated Kopetsky prior to her disappearance at the age of 17 a decade ago.

One possibility is that the tsunami was caused by an undersea landslide. Such a landslide would have displaced water and created waves, and the earthquake may have caused the rupture zone of the fault to move through an area where the seafloor rises or drops off, pushing seawater in front of it. Other possibilities are that the quake itself caused the tsunami, or that it was triggered by an earthquake-induced rupture on a strike-slip fault, reports the BBC. The death toll in Palu\u2014which is located on the island of Java\u2014now stands at more than 3,300, with more than 61,000 people injured, per the AP. In the wake of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami that killed more than a quarter-million people in Indonesia, the country promised to have a tsunami-detection system up and running by the end of this year. But the system has been \"simply put on hold\" since September, when the country's finance ministry, its geophysics agency, and a private company failed to come to an agreement on who should bear the brunt of the system's data. The project's final undersea point, off the coast of Padang, is just a few kilometers away.",

Tsunamis like the 18-foot monster wave that wrecked cities on Sulawesi island are usually caused by \"megathrust\" earthquakes that move land vertically, not \"strike-slip\" quakes like the 7.5-magnitude one Friday, which moved the earth horizontally, Patton says. The Sulawesi event was, however, localized, unlike the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. It may have been the case, Patton says, that massive undersea landslides created the tsunami, or that the narrow bay that Palu sits at the end of concentrated the wave's power. Indonesian authorities have been strongly criticized for apparently canceling the tsunami alert too early, though expert Adam Switzer at the Earth Observatory of Singapore tells the AP that this is unfair. \"What it shows is that the tsunami models we have now are too simplistic,\" he says. \"They don't take into account multiple events, multiple quakes within a short period of time.

It depicts a wedding between a princess from the Kaanul dynasty and a King of La Corona. \"This altar shows us a part of Guatemala's history, and in this case, around 1,500 years ago, I would say it's one of the best altars of its kind in the world,\" BarrientoS tells the New York Times. \"It's a high-quality work of art that shows us they were rulers entering into a period of great power and who were allying themselves with others to compete.\" La Corona \"was the place where the most important historical Mayan political movement began to take shape\" in the sixth century, when the Serpent Kingdom expanded from its capital of Dzibanche to La Corona, according to the Times. It's believed the altar dates back to May 12, 544 AD, the day Chak took over Tikal, the capital of the Kaenul dynasty, 20 years before he became a vassal and ruler of the larger city of Peru-Waka. But the gods associated with him are different from those associated with the area, the AP reports.

Discovered in 2017 at the Guatemalan site of La Corona, the nearly 1,500-year-old engraving depicts a king named Chak Took Ich'aak conjuring gods from a shaft shaped like a snake. Ich'aak later governed the nearby city of El Peru-Waka, suggesting that the so-called Serpent Kingdom or Kaanul dynasty forged a movement that grew until it defeated the towering city-state of Tikal in 562 A.D. \"...

The Canadian military has not confirmed what would be the longest kill shot by a sniper in history, but the story has in the meantime drawn attention to something else: the remarkable prowess of Canadian snipers in general. Some coverage: The training: If confirmed, that means the sniper record has been broken four times in the last 15 years, three of those times by Canadians, notes Maclean's magazine. One reason, it says, is because Canadian snipers \"are not simply taught to hit their targets.\" The training goes beyond their shooting duties, making sure they're able to \"design and run complex operations\" if necessary. \"That in itself may not make them better snipers but the gestalt of sniper-training and command-thinking combined could explain their skill.\" Long history: The CBC examines the history of Canada's military marksmanship, noting that Cpl. Francis Pegahmagabow of the 1st Canadian Infantry Battalion had 378 kills, making him deadliest sniper of World War I. A military historian says the skill carried into WWII. \"The best snipers were usually country boys who knew how to hunt.\" Official statement: The Canadian military has not confirmed the kill, but it did confirm the shot. \"A member of the Joint Task Force 2 successfully hit a target from 3,540 meters,\" it says in an email to NPR, adding that it won't divulge further details for troop safety. Really? The Globe and Mail says the shot was verified by video and data, but that hasn't emerged yet, and some are skeptical. The Washington Post talks to former US snipers who say that even seeing a human target would be difficult from that distance, even with advanced scopes.

King's argument is that the eight-line fragment appears to have been copied from a much earlier Greek text, perhaps composed in the second century, and that the forger may have \"wanted to put his or her own spin on modern theological issues,\" such as the role of women and celibacy in Christianity. King pored over the original carbon-dating and ink testing done on the ancient papyrus and concluded that \"such a combination of bumbling and sophistication seems extremely unlikely. I haven\u2019t seen any argument that I find at all compelling that would indicate that it\u2019s not genuine,\" says the director of New York University's Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, one of the world's top papyrologists.

The Boston Globe says it most likely dates to eighth-century Egypt, and the chemical composition of its ink is in line with the carbon-based inks the people of that country used at the time. But the Globe cautions that a master forger could have accessed the proper materials, and that traditional ink-dating methods couldn't be used because the papyrus is so small: a fragment roughly 1.5-by-3 inches in size bearing just eight incomplete lines (translation here). The Review also published a rebuttal by Brown Egyptology professor Leo Depuydt, who points to \"gross grammatical errors\" he says no native speaker of Coptic would make, the New York Times reports. (More criticism of the papyrus here.) The new findings certainly don't prove that Jesus was married, a point that King has never challenged; she'd like to see the debate shift to discussions of the document's significance, and \"questions like, 'Why does Jesus being married, or not, even matter?'\" King was in 2011 asked to review the fragment at the request of its anonymous owner, who says he bought it more than a decade earlier from a collector who said he purchased it, along with five others, in East Germany in the '60s.",

The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, didn't look at a cause-and-effect relationship, but a researcher tells the Times that the findings suggest that \"people with these variants may be at higher risk for Alzheimer\u2019s because they have more of the disease-related plaques and tangles in their brains.\" APOE is one of six genes known to increase a person's chances of developing the disease.",

Researchers scanned the brains of 1,187 healthy people between the ages of 3 and 20 and found, for instance, that the size of the hippocampus tends to be smaller in those with the e2/e4 combination. They also found some kids with e4 didn't perform as well on tests of memory, though they caught up with their peers by age 10, reports HealthDay News. And while brain researcher Rebecca Knickmeyer, who didn't participate in the study but wrote an accompanying editorial, says the variants aren't necessarily predictive and people shouldn't start testing their kids, the research suggests that Alzheimer's may in fact be a developmental disorder, not strictly an aging one, reports the Los Angeles Times. That raises the possibility that adjustments to \"diet or cognitive training\" early on could change someone's \"trajectory,\" per Knickmeyer. Three in four people have at least one copy of e3, which seems to offer a protective effect. About 14% of people have an e4 variant, which has been linked with an elevated risk of Alzheimer's, but Knickmeyer points out that there are many Alzheimer's patients without e4, and many with e4 who never develop Alzheimer's.

Michael Cohen, citing government raids on his home and offices, filed papers saying he plans to plead the Fifth in connection with the civil lawsuit \"due to the ongoing criminal investigation by the FBI and US Attorney for the Southern District of New York,\" CNN reports. Daniels is suing Cohen for defamation for accusing her of lying about her alleged affair with Trump, reports the Hill. She is also seeking to void a deal in which Cohen paid her $130,000 to stay quiet about the alleged affair. Michael Avenatti, Daniels' attorney, says the move is especially stunning because Cohen was Trump's \"fixer\" for more than a decade. \"Never before in our nation\u2019s history has the attorney for the sitting President invoked the 5th Amend in connection with issues surrounding the President,\" he tweeted. He also tweeted a link to a Washington Post story that noted Trump slammed Hillary Clinton staffers in 2016 for invoking the Fifth during the investigation of her email server\u2014but invoked the amendment himself during his 1990 divorce from Ivana Trump, dodging no fewer than 97 deposition questions, mostly about other women.

Reports don't specify the condition of the fries, or whether she even received them, but do make clear that an argument followed. Employees allege Dixson reached through the drive-thru window and, after an employee threw a soft drink at her, proceeded to spray them with Mace. The restaurant manager was hit directly in the face while two more employees were also in the line of the spray, per the police report. All three employees provided similar accounts of the incident, according to ABC News 5. Dixson is being charged with felony use of tear gas to immobilize. If found guilty, she\u2019ll face a maximum sentence of up to five years in prison and/or a $3,000 to $10,000 fine.

A nine-month restoration of the site, known as the Holy Edicule, has now revealed the tomb's date to be 325 AD, the same time when the Romans were said to have discovered it and built the church around it, National Geographic reports. To date, scientists from the National Technical University of Athens have used radar and laser scanning to date the glue that holds the structure together, as well as ground-penetrating radar and radioactive elements in the glue. \"What it does is, it corroborates our historical accounts,\" says National Geographic archaeology writer Kristin Romey. \"There is so much information in the data that was collected by the restorers during the conservation project.

It's easiest to understand the significance by understanding the history: Around AD 325, experts believe Roman Emperor Constantine the Great arrived in Jerusalem on the hunt for places linked to Jesus; his team identified the cave that they believed Jesus was buried in and built a shrine (known as the Edicule) to enclose the tomb and then a church around it. That church was destroyed in 1009, recounts National Geographic. It was rebuilt, and all archaeological dating coincided with that rebuilding\u2014proving it was at most about 1,000 years old. The tomb was opened for the first time in centuries in October 2016 to allow for the Edicule to be restored. A marble slab was discovered beneath marble cladding, and mortar samples taken from the slab dated to around AD 345. National Geographic's take: \"While it is archaeologically impossible to say that the tomb is the burial site of an individual Jew known as Jesus of Nazareth ...

Ron and Mary Tarnowski were found dead in the Brookston area, near a hunting shack the family owned about 30 miles from Duluth. Foul play isn't suspected. The Washington Post reports the couple lived near one of their sons, Karl Tarnowski, who noticed they uncharacteristically didn't return home on July 29. The Duluth News Tribune reports the couple didn't have cellphones or credit cards on them, nor did their car's OnStar system engage, leaving authorities with little to go on. But there was, perhaps, a general area: Their last sighting had been at 1pm on the day they went missing at a corner store near Brookston. KARE reports the Tarnowskis' Chevy Tahoe was found in a remote area, apparently stuck on what seemed to be a \"swampy\" trail typically accessed by snowmobilers in the winter. Mary, 78, was in the vehicle; Ron, 82, was outside it, some 50 feet from the road, suggesting he had gone in search of help. Karl tells the Post that it's thought both died the day they went missing; Mary is believed to have succumbed to dehydration and heat. The couple is depicted as a devoted one: A stroke at age 42 left Mary paralyzed on her right side; Ron was constantly by her side, but had himself begun to show early signs of dementia.

Contrary to previous research and conventional wisdom suggesting that a voicemail message is more intimate than email, this study finds that, at least among the 72 college-age millennials analyzed, the act of writing produced in the sender far more emotional arousal and greater use of emotional language. The effect endures, too, since people tend to respond to messages using the same medium, thus the recipient may in turn experience similarly heightened emotions when replying, reports Pacific Standard. \"When writing romantic emails, senders consciously or subconsciously added more positive content to their messages, perhaps to compensate for the medium's inability to convey vocal tone,\" Dennis and Wells wrote in the paper. \"Senders engage with email messages longer and may think about the task more deeply than when leaving voicemails. This extra processing may increase arousal.\" What's more, the students they studied have, they feel, adapted to the medium. \"If you look at the new generation of millennials, and that's who we studied, they've grown up with email and text messaging,\" one researcher says. \"So it may not be as unnatural a medium as we at first thought.\" Or, perhaps, voicemail is just more awkward.

But try procuring their fresh honey: It was taken from the South Lawn's first-ever bee hive, according to White House chef Sam Kass. The recipe was inspired by \"a local brew shop,\" Kass admits, and refined with advice from brewers already working at the White House. \"As far as we know the White House Honey Brown Ale is the first alcohol brewed or distilled on the White House grounds,\" even though George Washington distilled whiskey and brewed beer at Mount Vernon, Thomas Jefferson fermented his own wine, and there was drinking during Prohibition, writes Kass.

He played for Brazil in the 1958 World Cup, which the country's first championship, and was named the best player of the tournament. He died of cirrhosis of the liver at the age of 49 in 1983, and now officials in Rio de Janeiro say they've found the remains of the man also known as \"Alegria do Povo\" (Joy of the People) in two tombs in the city, reports O Globo. He was laid to rest in 1983 alongside other members of his family, and a second tomb was built in 1985. The cause of death hasn't been determined. Officials say the body was exhumed and taken to a niche, but there is no document to prove this. \"If the family agrees, we will find the remains with the family's blessing,\" says the cemetery's director.

A cousin says per ESPN FC the remains were removed from a grave in a cemetery near Rio 10 years ago, after another family member was buried there. Garrincha's bones were supposed to be transferred to a niche, but cemetery officials concede they have no idea if that ever happened. \"It's very upsetting not knowing where he is,\" says daughter Rosangela Santos. Cemeteries in Brazil are typically divided into two parts, one with tombs and another with concrete niches set like drawers into walls, per the BBC.

If the family agrees, Mage Mayor Rafael Tubarao says he'll order an exhumation of the graves and DNA tests of any bones.

King's theory was that the ancient Egyptian text contained a translation of the Gospel of John, in which Jesus is said to have said, \"I have a wife.\" Now, however, a Coptic specialist has published a paper in the Journal of Christian Origins asserting that the fragment's translation is indeed from the New Testament, and that the phrase \"My wife\" may have been used by Jesus to refer to his wife, Mary Magdalene. Christian Askeland writes that, based on his examination of the text, he's \"almost certain that the Jesus-was-married story line was divorced from reality.\" In other words, he says, Jesus was not married.

Christensen, 28, was initially charged in state court with kidnapping resulting in the death of Zhang, who was a 26-year-old visiting scholar from China who was last seen walking to a bus stop on June 9. Her body hasn't been found. Christensen was admitted to the university's highly competitive physics graduate program in 2011, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. Prosecutors say he lured Zhang into his black Saturn Astra on the Urbana-Champaign campus by saying he needed to get something to drink. They say he then forced her into his car, where he tortured and killed her before dumping her body in a park about a half-mile away. Christensen has been in custody since July, when police say he researched kidnappings and rapes online just hours before Zhang's disappearance. According to court documents, he claimed \"additional victims\" and said he \"desired to be known as a killer.\" Sessions had to approve the move, which is expected to delay Christensen's trial for months.",

Throughout November, the researchers will conduct flights over the park using the electromagnetic system, which acts like an X-ray to determine where and how hot water flows beneath the surface. The team also hopes to gain insights into the infrequent but sometimes massive hydrothermal explosions that occur in the park, says lead scientist Carol Finn with the US Geological Survey. One such explosion, or possibly multiple explosions, that occurred roughly 13,800 years ago left a crater that measures 1-1/2 miles across beneath at the bottom of Yellowstone Lake. It's believed to be the largest such crater in the world. Similar to the regular eruptions of Old Faithful, hydrothermal explosions occur when huge pockets of boiling water beneath the ground experience a sudden drop in pressure, causing the water to convert to steam and explode violently to the surface, per the Billings Gazette. \"Nobody knows anything about the flow paths\" for the hot water that erupts from Yellowstone's geysers. \"Does it travel down and back up?

Meanwhile, the Vatican remains quiet on the issue and lacks rules to probe and punish abusers, leaving it to local church leaders to take action. \"Consecrated women have to be encouraged to speak up when they are molested,\" says a Vatican official on the condition of anonymity. \"Bishops have to be encouraged to take them seriously, and make sure the priests are punished if guilty.\" But amid #MeToo and an ever-widening Catholic Church abuse scandal, more nuns may be speaking up for themselves. \"I see it as two freedoms: freedom of the weight for a victim, and freedom of a lie and a violation by the priest,\" says the nun allegedly assaulted in Bologna. \"I hope this helps other sisters free themselves of this weight.\"",

The offer was made in papers filed this week in California Superior Court in San Francisco. The firm said the case, which drew an abundance of unfavorable attention to its inner workings and the fate of women in Silicon Valley, cost it $972,815 in witness fees, deposition, and court reporter costs. As the winning party, Kleiner is asking the former associate, Ellen Pao, to reimburse it for these bills. But if she forgoes any appeal and lets the case die, the firm will forgive and forget, or at least move on. \"We believe that women in technology would be best served by having all parties focus on making progress on the issues of gender diversity outside of continued litigation,\" a Kleiner spokeswoman said in a statement. A spokeswoman for Pao, interim chief executive at Reddit, says she is considering the offer.",

If you bought $100 of the cryptocurrency that day, you'd be sitting on about $75 million, Business Insider reports. Now, every single bitcoin is worth more than $2,100, which is a new high for the digital currency, CNBC reports. One bitcoin was worth $280 in early 2014 and $900 at the end of 2016. The digital currency's value is believed to be linked to policy changes in Japan and China that have made it easier for speculators to trade in bitcoins. The price of a bitcoin has soared more than 5,000% since last December, making it the most valuable currency on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Bitcoin can be bought and sold using any number of wallets, meaning people can send it, for example, to someone who wants to buy them a drink. In other words, it's a great investment, even if some people find it hard to get their hands on it. \u2013 Laszlo Dvorsky, who calls himself a \"crypto-anarchist\" on the probiwon.com site, says he's been selling his two pizzas to people who buy bitcoin and give them to him as a tip. \u201cIt\u2019s a really cool idea,\" he tells the Christian Science Monitor. \"I didn\u2019t expect this to be so popular, but I can\u2019t really afford to keep doing it since I can't generate thousands of coins a day anymore.\"",

Analysts say several factors are behind the steep rise in the price of the currency, including political uncertainty worldwide and the ironing out of technical issues. Japan has also given bitcoins a big boost with new legislation allowing retailers to accept the currency. \"The Japanese have caught the bitcoin bug and inefficiencies across markets are being exposed,\" CryptoCompare founder Charles Hayter tells Business Insider.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 There will be no payday for 29 people who claimed to be Prince's heirs, including a woman who said the CIA covered up her marriage to the superstar, a Minnesota judge ruled in an order disclosed Friday. Reuters reports that Carver County Judge Kevin Eide ordered genetic testing for six other claimants: Prince's sister, Tyka Nelson, three half-siblings by his father, and a possible niece and grandniece. Two half-brothers from Prince's mother will not be tested under the judge's ruling, which will determine the future of an estate thought to be worth up to $500 million. Other rejected claimants include at least five people who claimed Prince was their father, and several who claimed that their father had an affair with Prince's mother, making their father Prince's real father and the late star their half-brother, the AP reports. Under Minnesota law, the estate of Prince\u2014who left no known will or surviving offspring\u2014will be split between siblings, half-siblings, and the offspring of any deceased siblings. Despite the order for genetic testing, Eide's ruling says he \"is not aware of any objection or dispute\" to the six siblings or half-siblings being legitimate heirs. (A DNA test ruled out an inmate in Colorado who claimed he was Prince's son.)",

Gerson is the editor in chief of the Wall Street Journal, and he has been among the most vocal critics of President Trump. Here's what else you need to know about Trump's first 100 days in office: \"In a real presidency in which he wields unimaginable power, they are nothing short of disastrous,\" writes the Los Angeles Times' editorial board in a first-person account. \"Although his policies are, for the most part, variations on classic Republican positions (many of which would have been undertaken by a President Ted Cruz or a President Marco Rubio), they become far more dangerous in the hands of this imprudent and erratic man,\" the board writes, citing his \"shocking lack of respect for those fundamental rules and institutions on which our government is based,\" his \"utter lack of regard for truth,\" and his \"scary willingness to repeat alt-right conspiracy theories, racist memes, and crackpot, out-of-the-mainstream ideas.\"",

The editorial ends with a plea for voters, protesters, members of Congress, state legislators, the courts, the media, etc., to be vigilant about protecting America from its own president. On Monday, part two focuses on Trump's capacity to lie. Plenty of politicians lie, of course, but what Trump \"brings to the equation is an apparent disregard for fact so profound as to suggest that he may not see much practical distinction between lies, if he believes they serve him, and the truth.\" What makes this especially dangerous is that Trump repeats the lies of others, even crackpots. \"He gives every indication that he is as much the gullible tool of liars as he is the liar in chief.\" Verification seems to be a foreign concept to Trump, but it can't be for everyone else, write the editors, who close with advice: \"Investigate.

They didn't know it was me.\" The works, \"View of the Sea at Scheveningen\" (1882) and \"Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen\" (1882-84), were never sold and are believed to be worth in the neighborhood of $10 million to $70 million each. In addition to bragging about the \"spectacular jobs\" he's done, Durham, 47, reveals for the first time how he got away with the paintings. He and an accomplice tied up the gallery's wall with rope, stuffed the paintings into a bag, and escaped in a getaway car. A security guard called the police, but she was not permitted to use force to try to stop the burglars. Durham left behind a black baseball cap. Police say the men used ropes to make their getaway from the Stedelijk Museum, where they stole two paintings by masters including Vincent Van Gogh and realist painter Paul Cezanne. One of the paintings taken was a seascape by Dutch master Willem de Kooning. The other was a painting by 19th-century Dutch painter Jaap Meijer.",

But why are women's cases harder to overturn? Daniel and Royal give their reasons: Women are usually convicted of violent crimes against people close to them (like a husband or son) so DNA evidence won't help; the suspect's DNA is already spread around the crime scene. By contrast, men usually assault or kill strangers. An incredible 63% of women's exoneration cases turn out to be accidents or suicides rather than crimes.

If true, that would contradict DA Mary Lacy's claim that the killer was an intruder. \"It's certainly possible that an intruder was responsible for the murder, but I don't think that the DNA evidence proves,\" one forensic expert tells the Denver Post. The new evidence involves a DNA profile known as \"unknown male\" that investigators used in the case. The profile was never able to replicate itself because it contained markers from more than two people. District Attorney Mary Lacy concluded that the profile belonged to only one person who killed the 6-year-old beauty queen in 1996, reports the Daily Camera. But the Bode Cellmark Forensics lab determined that DNA found at the scene of the murder wasn't from one person but from \"potentially accumulated DNA.\" The experts who spoke to the news organizations say that in exonerating John and Patsy Ramsey, Lacy ignored evidence that may have helped solve the case\u2014for example, the lab that performed DNA testing on the girl's underwear said it was \"likely\" the two samples found there came from \"more than\u2014 Eight years ago, then-DA Mary Lacy exonerated JonBeNet Ramsey's parents, John & Patsy Ramsey based in part on DNA evidence.

A joint investigation by the Boulder Daily Camera and 9News calls into question former District Attorney Mary Lacy's decision to exonerate the Ramsey family. At the time, Lacy concluded that DNA evidence found on JonBenet's underwear and long johns belonged to a male intruder who was not part of the Ramsey family. But now three forensic experts who examined the DNA test results and lab reports used by Lacy say they do not support her conclusion. For one thing, a sample on her underwear identified as coming from \"Unknown Male 1\" may in fact be a composite from multiple people and thus \"worthless as evidence,\" says the news report. Another revelation that further muddles the picture: DNA samples on her long johns appear to come from JonBenet and at least two other people, not one, a fact that has never been revealed before. What's more, the independent experts say all of the unknown DNA may be the result of \"inconsequential contact with other people,\" reports the Camera. With the exoneration, \"I was trying to prevent a horrible travesty of justice,\" Lacy tells ABC.

Here's what we know so far and what we don't know: The plane was in the safest part of flight: Just 10% of fatal crashes from 2004 through 2013 occurred while a plane was at cruise elevation, according to a safety study published by Boeing in August. Airbus jets have sophisticated computers that automatically adjust to wind shears or other weather disruptions. But weather\u2014combined with pilot errors\u2014has played a role in past air disasters that occurred at cruise altitude, including the 2009 Air France Flight 447 crash over the Atlantic Ocean. Another possibility is some type of catastrophic metal fatigue caused by the cycle of pressurization and depressurization associated with each takeoff and landing cycle. This A320 had had 13,600 takeoffs and landings. Many occurred in humid climate, which speeds corrosion. The last communication between the pilot and air traffic control was 6:12am Sunday when the pilot \"asked to avoid clouds by turning left and going higher to 38,000 feet.\" The last radar contact occurred: Indonesia has sent out two Cessna jets to join the search for AirAsia Flight 8501. More than 1,100 search-and-rescue personnel from six countries are on their way to the area. The Airbus A320 was carrying 155 passengers, including 18 children, and seven crew members.

The New York Times runs through some of the differences with AirAsia Flight 8501: Unlike with Flight 370, there has been no sign that anybody on Flight 8501 intentionally disabled any onboard systems, meaning that investigators should have the normal automatic transmissions from the flight to help the search. Flight 370 disappeared on a clear night, while Flight 8501 was believed to have encountered stormy weather, with weather agencies having reported lightning strikes along its route. The AirAsia pilot's last communication with air traffic control was a request \"to avoid clouds by turning left and going higher to 38,000 feet.\" Flight 370's pilot was very experienced, with more than 18,000 hours of flying time, while the combined experience of Flight 8501's pilot and co-pilot is believed to be less than half that. Neither Flight 370 nor Flight 8501 issued an emergency distress call, but, as the AP notes, \"pilots are trained to focus first on the emergency at hand and then communicate only when free,\" and there's no sign that the AirAsia flight diverted sharply from its intended course the way the Malaysia Airlines flight did. Another major difference is the search area for Flight 8501, which is much smaller and shallower than the vast area that has been searched for Flight 370. \"We are not talking about the deep Indian Ocean here,\" says CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest. \"We are talking about congested airspace around Southeast Asia.

Robin Camp of Alberta's Provincial Court ruled in 2013 that a man accused of sexual assault should not be tried because he was a \"good candidate for rehabilitation.\" The Alberta Court of Appeal overturned the ruling a year later, saying Camp had based it on \"myths and stereotypes\" about sexual assault victims. \"On reviewing the transcripts, I felt it was important that victims know this was not an acceptable way to be treated by the justice system,\" says Alberta Justice Minister Kathleen Ganley, who called for a public disciplinary hearing after scores of complaints were received. In a statement, Camp apologized to \"everyone who was hurt by my comments.\" The case involved Alexander Wagar, who was accused of sexually assaulting a woman in a Calgary parking lot in the early 1990s. He was charged with sexual assault, but his case was dismissed in 2014 after Camp ruled that the woman was too drunk to give consent and that she should have reported the assault to police.

Researchers looked at data from 91,000 women who had no cancer history when they started drinking, and found that the risk of breast cancer increased by 11% for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed per day. That's about six drinks per week, WebMD reports. The risk for proliferative benign breast disease, a risk factor for breast cancer, also increased, by about 16%. The study did not find a link between drinking before the first pregnancy and breast cancer. \"Breast tissues are particularly susceptible to environmental exposures between and first pregnancy because they undergo rapid cellular proliferation,\" says one of the researchers.

But a new analysis of the remains of Homo floresiensis, which stood three-and-a-half feet tall and weighed around 75 pounds, suggests the hobbits were long gone by the time modern humans arrived on the island about 50,000 years ago. The new analysis, published in Nature, reveals that the layers of sediment around the fossils weren't evenly deposited and varied widely in age even at similar depths, suggesting that hobbits lived far earlier than thought. \"At the time of the initial discovery, not enough of the older deposits had been exposed, and this led to an error in the interpretation of how the dates obtained at that time applied to the sediments that contained the hobbit remains,\" says a study co-author. Since the hobbit fossils were found, at least six additional hobbits have been exhumed from the cave, and the new age estimates suggest they are between 100,000 and 60,000 years old, while their stone tools date from as far back as 1\u2014the earliest evidence of modern humans on Flores comes from an area called the Soa Basin, where a million-year-old stone tools were found. That's fishy, scientists tell Discovery, but \"we do know that modern humans were on other islands in the region around this time and had reached Australia by 50,000 years earlier.\" Climate change, volcanoes, climate change, volcanic activity, and even interbreeding are among the possibilities. The hobbits may have been hunted to death by Homo sapiens, who were already well-established on Flores and already killed off other species like the pygmy elephants, which could have wiped out the endangered the pygmy elephant. \"If erosion could wipe off the island where the island's only one major animal\u2014and if there are only one one one of the only the only one-bathtubbathtubbathtub ...

Other possible causes for the extinction of Homo floresiensis include volcanoes, overhunting of pygmy elephants, and climate change. But it's not just their death that is mysterious. Scientists still don't know why these real-life hobbits were so small, how they got to Flores, or if they're even a different species.

The bird, which lived around the time of the extinction event that wiped out most of Earth's dinosaurs, had feathers about the size of sesame seeds and were more than twice as long as those of modern birds, the BBC reports. \"This is the first time that feathers have been seen on a non-avian theropod,\" the study's lead author says. The fossil of the Caihong juji was found in a cave in southern China, and researchers report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that the bird's iridescent blue-and-black coloration is likely the result of an ancient pigment called melanosomes. These pigment-like structures are present in birds today, including hummingbirds and swifts, but they're also found in penguins and birds of the genus Anchiornis, reports the New York Times. \"It's kind of mind-blowing to see these feathers ... on a dinosaur,\" says a co-author of the study. \"They're longer on both sides of the body.\" Caihong, meaning \"lion of the sky\" in Chinese, is a member of a group of dinosaur relatives known as flighted avialans, which also include oviraptors and dromaeosaurids, which include the triceratops and the dinosaur that gave us our first glimpse of the dinosaur's nose.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province. Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes\u2014similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

According to USA Today, the risk for babies born to women infected in the first three months of pregnancy is 1% to 13%. The risk is even lower for women infected during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. Researchers came up with the new estimate by looking at medical records from women in French Polynesia and Brazil during outbreaks of Zika between 2013 and 2014. The risk for microcephaly was even lower in women infected between the sixth and 35th week of pregnancy, according to the Times. \"This gave us an appreciation that the risk is substantial,\" the Times quotes a CDC biologist as saying. The study focused on one place, a state in northeast Brazil, and looked only at microcephaly. But health officials say Zika can cause other birth defects, too. \"These numbers are probably only the tip of the iceberg,\" a UCLA professor tells the AP.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A month after confirming Zika causes birth defects, CDC researchers say there is a \"substantial\" risk that a pregnant woman will have a baby with a birth defect if infected with Zika during her first trimester. More specifically, the risk for microencaphaly is 1% to 14% depending on the scenario, reports the AP. The range is wide given that research into the disease is relatively new. For the study, scientists analyzed data from 400 babies diagnosed with microcephaly\u2014in which babies are born with abnormally small heads\u2014in the Brazilian state of Bahia between July and February. Because the study focused exclusively on microcephaly in a single Brazilian state, \"these numbers are probably only the tip of the iceberg,\" says a UCLA professor. One notable quirk: the bigger the outbreak, the better the odds are of having a healthy baby\u2014because more women would be exposed before becoming pregnant and perhaps develop immunity. When the outbreak is small, the risk rises to the 14% level. An earlier study out of Brazil put the risk of Zika-related birth defects and fetal death at almost 30%, though one based on a Zika outbreak in French Polynesia put the risk of microcephaly at 1%. But even a 1% risk could be devastating in developing countries, where there are limited care options for disabled children, a health expert tells USA Today. A separate study published Wednesday notes three Brazilian infants with microcephaly showed eye problems not linked to Zika before, including retinal lesions, hemorrhaging, and abnormal blood vessel development, per a release.

The PBS series Super Cats follows them on nightly forays, showing how they hunt and explaining why they kill more prey in a night than a leopard does in half a year. German zoo curator Luke Hunter helped by fitting several black-footed cats with radio collars, enabling the crew to track them in tall grasses. \"If you're a gazelle or a wildebeest, a black-footed cat isn't at all deadly,\" says Hunter, who has studied the cats since the 1990s. \"But those success rates make them the deadliest little cat on Earth.\" And the black-footed cat has tricks. It can hunt by bounding randomly through grass, sneaking up on prey in a weaving pattern, or waiting patiently by burrows for a meal to emerge. They can \"wait for up to 2 hours, absolutely immobile, just silently waiting at the burrow for a rodent to appear,\" Hunter says. \"And then they nab it.\" They kill 10 to 14 small birds and rodents nightly, or about one every 50 minutes\u2014a constant hunt necessary to supply their active metabolisms. Like most felines in the series, the black-footed cat is endangered, but Hunter accentuates the positive: \"I believe it's mostly not doom and gloom,\" he says, but \"if we don't work to reduce those threats, then we could lose some of these animals.\" See the episode at PBS.

Called a marine astrolabe, it's believed to date from 1495 to 1500. Unlike the Game of Thrones intro astrolabe, sailors used this one to figure out where they were on the high seas. It was found in the wreck of the Esmeralda, part of the Portuguese explorer's armada. Da Gama, who discovered the first sea route from Europe to India, was returning home from his second trip there when he left some ships in the Indian Ocean to \"disrupt maritime trade,\" meaning pillage. Several of the ships sank during a fierce storm in 1503. The Esmeralda was discovered in 1998. Since excavations began in 2014, University of Warwick researchers have recovered 2,800 artifacts, the jewel of the cache being the astrolabe, a bronze disc measuring 7 inches in diameter. Emblems depict the Portuguese coat of arms and the personal stamp of King Dom Manuel I. \"It was like nothing else we had seen, and I immediately knew it was something very important because you could see it had these two emblems on it,\" team leader David Mearns of Blue Water Recoveries tells the BBC. \"It's a great privilege to find something so rare, something so historically important.\" At first, the team wasn't 100% sure it was an astrolabe, but laser scans revealed navigational marks around the edges every 5 degrees, which sailors would have used to calculate their location by measuring the sun's position above the horizon at noon.

He kept the hard drive he used to collect the digital currency, \"so if bitcoin did become valuable one day, I would still have the coins I mined,\" he tells the Telegraph. But in 2013, while cleaning his home in Newport, Wales, he mistakenly put the drive into a waste bin at his local landfill site, where it got buried. Now, with bitcoin's value hovering just above $17,000 Wednesday, according to digital-currency website CoinDesk, Howells' 7,500 lost bitcoins are worth more than $127 million. Howells says he's been unable to get permission from the local council to search for it, Gizmodo reports. \"Digging up a landfill is not as easy as just digging a hole in the ground,\" he says. \"A modern landfill is a complex engineering project and digging one up brings up all sorts of environmental issues, such as dangerous gasses and potential landfill fires.

The so-called \"Jessica Mokdad Human Rights Conference\" is being held by Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer, who have called for a \"total shutdown\" of Muslims. \"By presumptuously donning Ms. Mokdad's name on their conference, they are exploiting the tragedy of a young Arab-American girl to promote a bigoted agenda,\" says an open letter from the Arab American Institute. \"This is the time for our community to take a stand, along with all those who value America's commitment to diversity and freedom of religion, against the politics of division and bigotry promoted by the Islamophobes.\" Mokdad, a 20-year-old Muslim woman, was shot to death in Warren, Mich., last year. Organizers say the conference is needed to rescue Muslim women from the \"extremism and bigotry\" of Islam, reports the Detroit Free Press. \"We will directly challenge the narrative that will be presented by their conference and, more importantly, we will have a community conversation about how to respond to these continued attacks,\" says a statement from the ACLU of Michigan.",

Both meetings took place yesterday. Mokdad, 20, was killed last year by her Muslim stepdad, according to police. Though initially reported as a suspected honor killing, investigators now believe Mokdad was killed because she was about to tell police her stepfather was sexually abusing her, according to the Detroit Free Press. \"The evidence shows the motive really was not a cultural issue,\" said a lead investigator. \"It's about power, control, and rape.\" The honor killing conference immediately raised suspicions because it was organized by Pam Geller, critic of Islam and nationally known foe of the proposed Ground Zero Mosque. Geller insists Mokdad's death was an honor killing, and one more example of \"stealth enforcement\" of Islamic shariah law. Geller's group Stop the Islamization of America has been classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

The lawsuit, filed in Manhattan Supreme Court, accuses Corizon, which has a contract with the city to provide health care, of using \"physical and psychological force\" against inmate Christopher Dixon, including using a baton and a chokehold on him, and of failing to provide adequate medical care. Dixon, who is suing for $75,000, says he was beaten with a metal chair, a baton, and a brass chain after he was brought to a medical unit to be checked out for a substance believed to have been thrown at officers during a search of his cell. According to Dixon's lawsuit, the guards used excessive force when they brought him back to his cell after he had been taken to the medical unit. The guards, who were crowded around a gurney, punched Dixon in the head and repeatedly splashed him with a liquid before bringing in another inmate who had also thrown liquid at them, the lawsuit says. The medical unit's medical director said in an email to superiors that there was no video of the incident and that Dixon was unarmed when he was taken back to. Dixon is seeking $75,000.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Guards at Rikers Island don't just neglect the mentally ill or let them bake to death, they also routinely brutally beat them, often without suffering any repercussions, a New York Times investigation has discovered. The Times uncovered a secret report compiled by a city department this year that found that 129 Rikers inmates suffered \"serious injuries\" in altercations with staff members over an 11-month span last year; 77% of those inmates had a mental health diagnosis. In most cases, the inmates were beaten while handcuffed. The Times investigated the incidents individually, and offer some disturbing details: When guards found Jose Bautista trying to hang himself, they saved him, but then allegedly threw him to the ground and punched him with such force that they perforated his bowel. It was one of five beatings noted in the report that followed a suicide attempt. Bautista needed emergency surgery, but guards took nine hours to drive him to the hospital\u2014which is only 15 minutes away. When Andre Lane threw water or urine at guards, they allegedly handcuffed him to a gurney, wheeled him to a clinic that wasn't monitored by security cameras, and beat him so violently that the walls and cabinets were covered with his blood. After Brian Mack complained that guards were stealing inmates' food, a guard captain allegedly hit him in the eye with his radio, while another officer punched him in the jaw. He came away with a broken eye socket and jaw. Correction officials said he'd been in a fight with another inmate, but investigators noted no such fight was logged in prison records. None of the guards involved in any of the cases have faced criminal charges\u2014or even administrative ones. Rikers has been under pressure to reform its treatment of mentally ill inmates\u2014in January, for example, it announced it would stop putting the \"seriously mentally ill\" in solitary, though the Times notes that classification applies to a small segment of the population.

The paper notes challenges faced by supposed \"deadbeat\" dads who are actually living in poverty, running up their support tabs because they couldn't afford them in the first place, then getting thrown in jail and losing their jobs\u2014all while the debt builds. \"Parents who are truly destitute go to jail over and over again for child support debt simply because they're poor,\" a lawyer for the Southern Center for Human Rights tells the Times. Part of the problem right from the start: Support orders are often crafted using not a parent's actual income, but what's called \"imputed\" income, which gauges how much the parent would earn at a full-time job that made minimum wage. Indeed, a 2007 Urban Institute study cited by the Times notes that 70% of child support debt in nine states was owed by individuals who reported $10,000 or less in income (some didn't report any income). The commissioner of the federal Office of Child Support Enforcement tells the Times that jail time was originally intended for people purposely hiding funds\u2014not parents who couldn't afford the payments. Even a Supreme Court ruling from 2011 meant to prevent this from happening can prove futile, because some defendants can't afford lawyers to help them out, advocates say. In Scott's case, it was a cycle he apparently couldn't break. In a 2003 article on a new program in the Post and Courier, Scott noted he had enrolled in the program, meant to help dads catch up on payments, and voluntarily turned himself in for more jail time. \"This whole time in jail, my child support is still going up,\" he said at the time. \"I said, 'Man, you got four kids depending on you. \u2026 You got to get it together.\"",

The sheriff did not disclose details of how the drug was smuggled in the drawings because \"people may want to copy.\" On June 15, administrative personnel noticed \"oddities\" hidden in mail addressed to Gill, the sheriff says. On June 20, another letter to Gill with children's Drawings was inspected and also discovered to contain drawings with suspected Suboxone. Eight days later, more mail to Gill arrived at the jail. When the mail was inspected, suspected Suboxone was found hidden on the paper, Provenzano says. Giles was charged with third-degree possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance. Gill was charge with attempting to possess acontrolled dangerous substance, and his bail was set at $10,000.",

Somerset County Sheriff Frank Provenzano says staff noticed something strange about mail addressed to inmate Michael Gill on June 15, the AP reports. A K-9 unit was called and alerted on what turned out to be the opioid Suboxone concealed in the drawings, authorities say. The prescription drug, which usually comes in patch form or as a film that can be placed under the tongue, is used to help people addicted to heroin or other opiates avoid withdrawal symptoms, but can produce a high of its own when abused. The sheriff says another letter with children's drawings addressed to Gill arrived June 20 and more mail was sent to the jail eight days later. Again, suspected Suboxone was found hidden in the drawings, authorities say. The sheriff tells the Courier News of Bridgewater that to to prevent copycats, he won't disclose how the drug was concealed in the drawings. Authorities charged 37-year-old Casey Giles, of Bridgewater, with possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance. She was jailed on $20,000 bail.

Nabra Hassanen, 17, was with a group of four or five teens who were walking back from an IHOP after breakfast when they were confronted by a motorist around 2am. All but one of the teens ran to the All Dulles Area Muslim Society mosque in Sterling, where they reported that the girl had been left behind. Police found the girl's remains and arrested Darwin Martinez Torres. Police have not said whether the death is being investigated as a hate crime, the AP reports. \"Based on the information that detectives have, there's no indication that this was a hate or bias crime,\" a police spokesman tells Bustle.",

No elaboration was given. But that hasn't kept a religious bent out of discussion of and reactions to Nabra Hassanen's killing. As the Washington Post puts it, \"the issue was on the minds of many Muslims on Sunday.\" The latest: A police press release on the arrest of Darwin Martinez Torres, 22, says that as Nabra and her friends were walking \"they got into a dispute with a man in a car.\" Torres allegedly exited his car and assaulted Nabra. \"Her friends could not find her and police were called to help.\" The Washington Post talks to Nabra's mother, who says a detective said her daughter was beaten with a metal bat. \"I lost my daughter, my first reason for happiness,\u201d she said Sunday night. WUSA9 reports police did recover a bat. \"What investigators told the father and the mother, he hit her in the head and put her in the car and he threw her in the water,\" the Richmond Times-Dispatch quotes a rep for the family as saying. It reports Martinez Torres directed officers to the pond, which it says is near the apartment he lives in. The Post fills in some details on the girls' movements, reporting that during the final 10 days of the holy month of Ramadan, the All Dulles Area Muslim Society (ADAMS) in Sterling, Va., holds extra prayers at midnight and 2am. The mosque is one of the largest in the US, and ADAMS' co-chair says it is commonplace for members to have a meal at McDonald\u2019s or IHOP in advance of the day's fast, which runs from sunrise to sunset. Nabra, a rising high school junior, was not particularly religious and did not usually wear Muslim dress, according to her mother, who lent Nabra an abaya to wear to the mosque Saturday night. She tells the Post a detective told her that during the fateful encounter, Nabra tripped over the long garment and fell. Bustle reports that while this may not be a hate crime, the number of anti-Muslim hate groups did spike in 2016 to 101, about triple the number the Southern Poverty Law Center recorded in 2015. Mindy Kaling was one of the celebrities to post about Nabra (in this case, before police specified it was not a hate crime investigation), writing on Facebook, \"Nabra Hassanen, I won't forget you and what happened to you.

The state is \"about as close to an all-important state as we're likely to see,\" he writes. First, the state is about 2 or 3 percentage points more Republican-leaning than the country as a whole, and it has a large population. Second, Florida is one of the largest states in any battleground state, with a large African-American and Latino population. \"In this scenario, the nonwhite vote in Florida might allow Clinton to hold onto the state even if she were to lose Michigan, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Wisconsin,\" Silver says. If she does win those states, she can also afford to lose Pennsylvania, where she's held a lead even as Donald Trump is behind in next-door Ohio. If Trump loses Florida,\u2014Donald Trump is making the unprecedented assertion that the general election \"is going to be rigged,\" and many people who are drawn to his presidential campaign have major doubts about the accuracy of the Nov. 8 vote.

There, operating surgeon Dr. Igor Nichiporenko quickly did \"damage control\" on the badly injured teen, who'd been shot in the abdomen, chest, and upper sternum, with tendons \"shattered from gunshot wounds.\" Astonishingly, Wilford was out of the hospital in less than a week. \"Young people have a tendency to heal very fast,\" Nichiporenko says, per the New York Times. \"She's very, very lucky.\" He adds that Ojeda's decision saved Maddy's life. Ojeda is just glad he was there to make the call. \"I thank God for allowing us to be an instrument in this miracle,\" he told CNN Tuesday. As for Maddy? \"I'm so grateful to be here,\" she said at the news conference, per CNN.",

Now Gray has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise money for research into a cure. \"If we save the girls ... we've potentially cured this disease,\" Gray says. \"When I explain to people, I talk about Doug Flutie and Boston College and that Hail Mary pass in the Cotton Bowl,\" he adds. \"What I'm trying to buy right now is three Hail Mary passes before.\"",

Worries about speech and mobility issues and seizures led to Titus' diagnosis in April. Because the disease is genetic, there was a 25% chance his little brother would have it. Ely took a test in June, and the family's worst fears were confirmed. Both boys have late-infantile CLN2 and will face dramatic declines before dying young. Titus is already suffering the effects. \"When we got the diagnosis, [Titus] was still talking, walking and eating,\" Bekah says. \"Within a month ... he lost all of those abilities. He's blind, he cannot walk anymore, he's in a wheelchair, he's eating through a GJ tube and he doesn't talk anymore.\" Still, the Bowmans are finding a way to be thankful for every day they have with their boys.

That snow could help hide Dorner, but could also make any movements on foot difficult, the Times notes.

He was shot and killed by Fidel Castro's forces while on a mission in the Sierra Maestra in December 1958. Morgan had been a member of the anti-Communist Escambray Front, one of several groups that supported a Western-style democracy in Cuba at the time. \"I have lived always looking for something,\" he told another gunrunner before heading to Havana. \"We were always outnumbered at least 30 to one. We became known as the phantom.\" Among the first to join the revolution was Morgan's own father, a Marine who had served in the Pacific during World War II. After the war, Morgan returned to the US, where he became a businessman. But he left behind a wife and three children in Florida, and when Castro came to power in 1959, Morgan was one of the most high-profile defectors. He met his future wife, Olga Rodrguez, in a rebel camp in 1958. She was a poor peasant girl from a poor family living in the central province of Santa Clara who had joined the underground resistance after the Batista regime's. Morgan was a wealthy private equity investor who'd been hired by the British crown to plunder gold from Cuba when it was a Spanish colony. He and another US agent were able to convince the CIA they were part of an anti-Castro militia\u2014only to have the militiamen open fire on the plotters as they tried to board a plane bound for the US.

Spamhaus accuses Cyberbunkers of working with \"criminal gangs\" in Russia and Eastern Europe to launch the attack. \"If you aimed this at Downing Street, they would be down instantly,\" says the CEO of Spamhaus. \"They would be completely off the Internet.\" Five national cyber-police forces are investigating the attack, which Spamhaus says has been going on for more than a week. \"We've been under this cyber-enial attack for well over a week,\" he says. \"Our engineers are doing an immense job in keeping it up\u2014this sort of attack would take down pretty much anything else.\"",

Millions of users are experiencing delays while trying to reach websites or while using services like Netflix, and experts fear that if the attacks continue to grow in power, people may not be able to access things like email or online banking. It all started when Spamhaus, which publishes a blacklist that email providers use to weed out spam, put Cyberbunker on its list of spammers. Cyberbunker retaliated, but its attack on Spamhaus ended up having a much larger impact. One architect at a digital content provider likened it to, as the New York Times puts it, using a machine gun in an effort to assassinate one person. The distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks \"are essentially like nuclear bombs\" that exploit the Internet's Domain Name System (DNS), says an exec at a group that tried to defend against the attacks and ended up becoming a target. \"It's so easy to cause so much damage.\" And, notes the architect, this is \"the largest publicly announced DDoS attack in the history of the Internet.\" Cyberbunker says Spamhaus is a vigilante group \"abusing [its] influence,\" but the architect notes that Cyberbunker is \"just mad\" that it got caught spamming.

That's up from 28% in 2010, and it's the highest figure since the CDC started the survey in 1982. The CDC blames a variety of factors, including obesity, a lack of physical activity by children and teens, and a general lack of interest in physical activity, the Journal notes.

And the number of Americans who engaged in not a single one of those 104 activities in all of 2014 is more than one in four of us: That's 83 million people, or 28% of the US population over the age of 6, reports the Wall Street Journal. \"We feel confident, in a sad way, that this is the largest number we\u2019ve ever seen,\" says PAC member and Sports and Fitness Industry Association exec Tom Cove, who adds it's the most dismal result he's seen in 24 years. The number of completely sedentary Americans increased by 18% since 2007. That's not to say we don't like the appearance of fitness, just the actuality of it: The Journal notes the rise of \"athleisure\" apparel; such footwear saw sales jump 8% in the year ending April 11, while performance shoes took an 18% dive. The PAC traces the decline to our schools, which help form our lifelong fitness habits and where kids are spending less time in gym class and recess. Another problem? The increasingly cutthroat nature of sports is forcing more casual athletes to the sidelines. Says Cove: \"There are way too many kids who leave sports at age 9, 10, 11, because they simply have to make a decision: Am I going to be a travel soccer kid and devote my life to this, or are there other things that I want to do?\" (An editorial argues that it's not lack of exercise causing an obesity epidemic, it's the food industry's unhealthy products.)",

But the scale of the planned protests across Europe also underscores the extent to which the technology has upended one of the industry's major industries. More than 30,000 taxi and limo drivers across Europe went on strike today, snarling traffic in cities from London to Madrid and Berlin to Paris, in their biggest protest against Uber so far. They're calling for tougher regulations on the ride-sharing service, which allows customers to order a ride without a driver's license for $270,000 per trip. In London, black-cab drivers were joined by private-car services and trainees to protest the government's failure to hold Uber to the same standards as other car services and taxis. \"Yes this is chaos, its causing havoc in the very center of London, but what other choice have we got?\" says a taxi driver with 14 years experience.

Reporting in the journal Current Biology, researchers say that when they first played a game in which participants listened to sounds in one hemisphere only, the left hemisphere tended to play a larger role in the early stages of understanding, while the right hemisphere played a smaller role. When they switched to whistled Turkish, however, participants understood both syllables in roughly equal measure. \"They tell us that the organization of our brain, in terms of its asymmetrical structure, is not as fixed as we assume,\" says Onur Gntrkn. \"The way information is given to us appears to change the architecture of our brains in aradical way.\" Click for more.",

But that changed when German researcher Onur G\u00fcnt\u00fcrk\u00fcn decided to study the whistled version of Turkish. G\u00fcnt\u00fcrk\u00fcn wanted to see if its musicality might require the brain's right hemisphere, which handles frequency, pitch, and melody. His study of 31 whistled Turkish speakers showed the left hemisphere was 75% dominant with spoken Turkish, but the split between hemispheres was even with the whistled language. \"We\u2019ve shown for the first time equal contributions from both hemispheres,\" says G\u00fcnt\u00fcrk\u00fcn, whose study was published in Current Biology. He tells the New Yorker that this suggests our brain structure \"is not as fixed as we assume\" and that the way information is delivered changes it. The language developed because whistles carry further than spoken words, and its messages can be understood across mountains and valleys. (The New Yorker offers an example of a whistle that means, \"Do you have fresh bread?\") It's lucky G\u00fcnt\u00fcrk\u00fcn got his study in when he did, as modern technology is killing off whistled Turkish. \"You can gossip with a mobile phone, but you can't do that with whistling because the whole valley hears,\" he says.

On Wednesday, a circuit court judge ruled that a ballot had to be counted because it was an example of an \"overvote.\" The race was seen as a bellwether for the nation and a rebuke of President Trump. The district voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012. The seat has long been held by Republicans, who had a 66 to 34 advantage in the House before the election.

The bunker, built during the Cold War, was filled with Soviet-era weapons and abandoned after the fall of the Soviet Union, LiveScience reports. During that time, thousands of wood ants fell down a ventilation pipe into the bunker and couldn't climb back up. So the ants built a nest over the pipe and stuck it there for years. But when the pipe was finally removed, the open hole left by thousands of ants forced the ants to build a new nest over it, according to a study published in the Journal of Hymenoptera. \"Flat parts of the mound and the adjacent spaces ... were carpeted with bodies of dead ants,\" the researchers say. \"The sheer numbers of dead bodies suggest that this orphaned wood ants nest has been active for years, building a nest from soil and maintaining it in typical wood ant fashion. Except, of course, it's far from normal.\" The researchers estimate that several hundred thousand ants, possibly a million, call the bizarre barren mound home. In the summer, the ants climb the walls of the bunker, perhaps in an effort to touch the warmer air coming from above. But the researcher saw no ants on the ceiling. If the ants closer to the surface had self-awareness of their plight, surely by now they would have developed. There's no evidence that the ants are able to produce offspring.

What sounds like a death sentence (they can\u2019t climb out, there is no food, and it is very cold) has turned into a survival story because these worker ants keep doing what they always do: building until they die. And when they do? \"A younger generation is on its way, ready to cart off the fallen to a two-million-strong ant cemetery beyond the mound and continue their endless, pointless labor,\" reports Inverse. Researchers write in the Journal of Hymenoptera that a million or so trapped ants have managed to carry on in a virtual Cold War nightmare, living in a near-starvation state and total darkness. The colony rests atop a thick cemetery of ant ancestors, indicating this has been going on for quite some time. Zoologists who stumbled upon the odd discovery in Templewo while counting bats doubted cannibalism was keeping the insects alive, suggesting bat excrement could be doing the trick. The ants produce no offspring, and so the colony's survival depends on surface ants making the same mistake they did. Wood ants are known to be resilient, though, with one colony surviving on a barren islet for nearly 30 years with only pine trees to munch, the researchers write.

According to the AP, Trump University accused students of being scammed by \"untruths\" in its \"secretive and Margaritaville-style\" lectures. Trump agreed to pay $25 million to settle two lawsuits alleging fraud at the school. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco finalized the settlement after an appeal by Sherri Simpson, a Florida woman who said she spent roughly $19,000 on Trump University workshops, NBC News reports. Simpson had wanted to opt out of a class-action suit in order to pursue a separate suit against Trump, but the court rejected that. Students had alleged that Trump University, which was open from 2005 to 2010, used false advertising and high-pressure sales techniques to lure them to free investor workshops at which they were sold expensive seminars and told they would be mentored by real estate gurus, leading to the loss of thousands of dollars in tuition. \"For years, President Trump refused to compensate the victims of his sham university,\" New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman says in a statement. \"His reversal in 2016\u2014and the large-scale settlement that resulted\u2014opened the door for student victims to finally obtain the restitution they deserve.\"",

On Tuesday, an appeals court in San Francisco approved a $25 million settlement reached last year while rejecting an appeal from a Florida woman who hoped to opt out of the class-action lawsuit and pursue a separate case against Trump, reports NBC News. Sherri Simpson, who says she paid $19,000 for Trump University classes, argued a notice sent to students early in the litigation progress promised they could opt out at the time the notice was sent or after a proposed settlement. But judges said the notice gave \"only one opportunity to opt out.\" They added \"among over 8,000 class members, Simpson is the only one advancing this understanding of the notice,\" per Politico. The decision also referenced claims that Simpson's challenge was politically motivated to hurt the president. Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump vowed to fight allegations that students paid up to $35,000 for Trump University programs based on false promises they'd reveal Trump's \"secrets of success,\" per the Los Angeles Times. Though Trump quickly agreed to the $25 million settlement after his election victory, his lawyers said he'd back out if Simpson were granted a trial. Though \"we are disappointed \u2026 all of the lurid facts about the fraud won't receive the public hearing they deserve,\" her lawyer says Simpson will end her fight so that 4,000 students can receive payments.

That helped drain customer bank accounts faster and drive up overdraft fees. Wells Fargo adopted the policies beginning in 2001, and they became widespread across the banking industry.

Commissioner Rob Manfred says in his decision that Rose \"claims not to remember significant misconduct detailed in the Dowd Report and corroborated by Michael Bertolini's betting notebook.\" Manfred says it's \"not at all clear to me that Mr. Rose has a grasp of the scope of his violations of Rule 21.\" Rose was hit with the lifetime ban in 1989, after an investigation found that he had gambling ties with the Cincinnati Reds, his former team. In a statement, Manfred said he was \"not convinced\" that Rose has \"avoided the type of conduct and associations that originally led to his placement on the permanent ineligible list.\" He added: \"I respect Mr. ROSE's accomplishments as a player, and as result, I will.\" ESPN's Outside the Lines reported earlier this year that it had obtained a notebook that shows Rose bet on at least one MLB team\u2014including on Reds games he played\u2014on at least 30 times in a four-month period beginning in March 1986.

MLB.com notes Manfred informed Rose, both verbally and in writing, of his decision. The \"stark language\" of the league's rules dictates \"that the penalty for a player or manager who bets on a game in which he has a duty to perform is mandatory, permanent ineligibility,\" Manfred says in his announcement accompanying the MLB press release.

In addition to a polygraph test and a private meeting between Rose and Manfred in September, that new evidence included an incriminating notebook revealed in a June ESPN report that indicates Rose also bet while still playing for the Reds. Manfred notes that during that conversation, Rose had inconsistent stories, made contradictory statements, and couldn't remember important facts from the Dowd document. Another nugget came to light during Manfred and Rose's meeting that appears to have influenced the decision. \"Significantly, [Rose] told me that currently he bets recreationally and legally on horses and sports, including Baseball,\" Manfred notes.

The estate that holds the copyright to the speech is suing CBS, which aired the speech on TV in 1968, for copyright infringement. The suit says CBS didn't register the speech under the Copyright Act of 1909, and that since King was a private citizen and not a federal employee, the speech's copyrights belonged to him. \"How is it that one estate can control the use of\u2014Martin Luther King Sr.\u2019s speeches won\u2019t be In the Public Domain for Another 70 Years\u2014until At least 2039\u2014thanks to a bill introduced in Congress this week?\" asks Elspeth Reeve at the Guardian. The bill, which was introduced by Rep. Robert Goodlatte, R- Va., would require copyright owners to pay licensing fees if they want excerpts of speeches to be made public. But the King estate, which has licensed the film Selma's rights to some of King's speeches, argues that such a mandate would force authors to pay hefty licensing fees. \"Sadly, the lawyers for some members of Dr. King\u2019s family don\u2019t see it that way,\" writes John Fund at the National Review.",

He said the referendum should take place \"as soon as possible\" to determine the future of Crimea, which Russia has promised to keep after annexing it. In Crimea, activists and journalists have been kidnapped and abused by pro-Kremlin militia, the International Business Times reports. \"This is real terror, when people are getting abducted, when armed men are walking the streets, when journalists are getting beaten,\" says a journalist in Simferopol. \"Moreover, very many 'titushkas' (thugs hired by the ousted Yanukovych regime) were also brought to Kyiv from Crimea.\" In Sevastopol, where Russia has a sizable naval base, dozens of armed pro-Russia men have seized control of the port.

We all have umbilical cords, so why don't we all have a navel?

The reason for the lack of buttons is actually quite simple, according to a post at the Huffington Post UK: The umbilicus, the part of the body that connects the baby's belly to.

And she has questions for renowned plastic surgeon Younan Nowzardan, who performed the surgery: \"What happened to it? Did you throw it in the trash?\" Nowzardan, however, tells KTRK he informed Jones that, because of a preexisting scar, the belly button was going to go. \"We can call Hollywood and get an Oscar nomination for her,\" he says, adding that he can go back in and give Jones a new belly button. But Jones says she has contacted an attorney and wants to settle the issue in court. Her displeasure notwithstanding, Jones is not alone in being belly-button-less. Fashion model Karolina Kurkova, for instance, is lacking a navel because of a surgery she had as an infant, the New York Daily News noted when this odd fact made headlines a few years ago.

Failures in the cars' AC or other equipment were factors in 19 of the 46 cases, while officer negligence was blamed in 26.

According to FBI data, more than 39,000 people were arrested for prostitution and related charges in 2016. It is believed that 80% of women arrested on prostitution charges are either under the control of a third party or have been trafficked at some point. The investigation found cases of the bond system being used in sex trafficking operations in at least five states. Pimps and sex buyers are locating incarcerated women awaiting a court date by using personal data such as mugshots and bail bonds posted online, or through corrupt bondsmen.

In a companion piece, the Guardian shares Kate's story: While incarcerated at Florida's Lowell Correctional Institution, a stranger named Richard Rawls began to write to her, saying he saw her mugshot online and that it stuck with him. He knew she'd be out soon. He told her to \"come on home to your daddy,\" that he would provide a comfortable home and all the love she needed. Instead, she was taken to a roach-infested house guarded by pit bulls; inside were other former inmates from the same prison.

The company's traditional car lineup will be reduced to just the Mustang and a new Focus Active crossover that will debut next year. The move comes after Ford reported a first-quarter profit of $1.7 billion, up 9% from a year ago, thanks in large part to a drop in its effective tax rate from 28.6% to 9%. However, pretax profits fell 14% to $2.2 billion as rising commodity prices took a toll.

In 1843, church president Joseph Smith wrote that he prayed to know why Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, and Solomon had so many wives. \"The Lord responded that He had commanded them to enter into the practice,\" Smith wrote.

The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\"). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home.

Here's a look at what experts are saying: 'Very unlikely': At Popular Mechanics, Kyle Mizokami tosses cold water on the idea that \"GPS spoofing\" is to blame. For one thing, broadcasting such an interference signal would likely have affected dozens of ships in the area, not just the USS McCain, and there's no indication of that. Plus, Navy ships don't rely solely on GPS: Human spotters should have seen the hazard. It's fishy: \"There\u2019s something more than just human error going on,\" a former information warfare specialist for the Navy tells McClatchy, referring to the string of Navy accidents. The story notes that on June 22, hackers appear to have manipulated the GPS signals of 20 ships in the Black Sea, the first such instance of GPS misdirection, or spoofing. The ships' GPSes actually told them they were on land, and the best guess is that the interference came from Russia.

Researchers asked 100 men and 100 women to smell the shirts for three consecutive nights, then rate the shirts on a scale of one to 10. Participants rated the donors' level of extroversion, neuroticism, dominance, and anxiety. The judges' scores matched up with the personality traits of the donors, but the matches weren't perfect, the researchers say in a post at Eureka Alert. But participants were able to accurately predict which donors were high in neuroticism and high in dominance. dominance was most accurate when a rater was analyzing the odor of someone who was the opposite sex. The findings are preliminary, and more studies need to be done, but researchers say the results suggest that personality traits can be expressed physiologically, including through our emotions, reports MyHealthNewsDaily.

The plague, which killed more than a million people in Europe before dying out in the 19th century, resurfaced in the Black Death virus, which is spread by infected fleas, the BBC reports. Black Death was first recorded in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the 1940s, and the country saw its first plague case in 1950. Since then, the number of cases has risen every year. In Africa, the risk of the plague is on the rise as the continent's agriculture continues to expand. In a study published in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, researchers note that as cropland continues to increase, rodent populations are also rising, creating \"the perfect storm for plague transmission.\" Symptoms include fever, chills, body aches, weakness, and nausea. People can be infected through unprotected contact with infectious bodily fluids or contaminated materials the inhalation of respiratory droplets/small particles from a patient with pneuMonic plague.

By studying tree rings to learn about precise climate fluctuations during the multiple epidemics from 1347 into the 1700s, a team out of the University of Oslo is reporting in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that giant gerbils in Asia were the more likely culprit. The working theory is that wet springs followed by warm summers in Asia prompted gerbil populations to soar, and that within a few years plague bacteria would show up in harbor cities in Europe, sweeping the continent from there. \"If we're right, we'll have to rewrite that part of history,\" a researcher tells the BBC. \"Suddenly we could sort out a problem,\" the researcher continues. \"Why did we have these waves of plagues in Europe? We originally thought it was due to rats and climatic changes in Europe, but now we know it goes back to Central Asia.\" Next up: sequencing plague bacteria from skeletons across Europe. If there's considerable genetic variation in the disease, this will support the theory that new strains kept arriving from Asia, as opposed to persisting in rat reservoirs in Europe.

The Seattle City Council voted 7-2 Tuesday to scrap the tax, which would have charged companies $275 per full-time worker each year, the AP reports. The measure had passed earlier this year, but businesses opposed to the tax raised more than $280,000 to fight it in a referendum before it was repealed. \"Proponents of engaging in a prolonged, expensive political fight, the City and I will continue to move forward on building real partnerships that align our strategies from business, advocates, philanthropy,\" Mayor Jenny Durkan said in a statement, per the Seattle Times. Durkan had called for the tax to be repealed after Amazon halted planning for two tower projects in response to the measure. The tax would have collected about $275 per head on employees at businesses with more than $20 million in annual revenue, raising roughly $48 million a year for housing and other services for the city's booming homeless population. (Amazon temporarily halted construction of a tower in downtown Seattle in opposition.)",

This: \"We have reached the conclusion that this is not a winnable battle at this time.\" That was the pronouncement of Seattle Councilwoman Lisa Herbold Tuesday in advance of what ended up being a 7-2 vote to reverse a new tax the council had unanimously approved only a month prior. The so-called \"head tax\" would have generated just shy of $50 million annually to put toward homelessness and affordable housing by charging businesses that generate more than $20 million in revenue a year about $275 per employee. That would have hit about 3% of businesses in the city, one of which is Amazon, which would have contributed about 25% of the expected total, reports NPR. The company was vocal in its opposition. And per SeattlePI.com, the \"stunning wealth\" of Amazon, Starbucks, and the rest of the opposition drove the reversal. As Councilwoman Lorena Gonzalez explains, \"I have been unable to find a way forward that we could out-fund and out-resource the opposition campaign by November\" (the opposition was campaigning for a referendum on the tax in the fall). \"Money has funded this campaign that put us in a position where we have to repeal this law.\" The AP characterizes city leaders as having \"underestimated the frustration\" over not just the tax but the fact that while $68 million was spent on homelessness last year, a January count found the homeless population in the Seattle area up 4%, to 12,000, suggesting to some that the city's current resources weren't being used appropriately.",

But at the BBC, a review of existing research on the topic suggests the drinks' variety itself isn't the problem. Instead, Claudia Hammond points to other possible factors. For instance, she notes, having several different types of drinks may simply mean drinking more total alcohol. (As for \"beer before liquor, never been sicker\"? It appears no research has been done to prove or disprove the idea that drink order makes a difference.) \"The existing evidence suggests that hangovers can't be blamed on mixing drinks,\" Hammond writes. But the amount of alcohol may not be the only culprit: Congeners, the non-ethanol products of the fermentation process, also contribute to a hangover. Tannins, for instance, are responsible for the color in darker types of alcohol. There are 37 times more congeners in bourbon than in vodka, and one study found that bourbon drinkers reported worse hangovers than those who drank vodka. So, Hammond writes, people having various types of drinks in a single night may end up indulging in drinks with more tannins. So go ahead and mix types of alcohol if you so desire, but you may want to avoid mixing alcohol with cigarettes: A study last month found that people who smoke and drink are at a higher risk of developing esophageal cancer, Science Daily reported.

The report, part of an investigation into allegations that Ford assaulted several staffers, says the mayor often drank heavily, sometimes while inebriated, and became \"rambling and incoherent\" after taking a few sips of vodka. One former staffer says that on one occasion, the mayor pulled over and talked football with an assistant football coach. \"The mayor pulled his car over (likely at a high school, was Fickel's recollection) and grabbed an LCBO paper bag from in front of the passenger seat which contained a fresh bottle of vodka and drank the 11 or 12 oz. mickey in one-two minutes going back and forth with a Gatorade,\" he says. Fickel says he got out of the Escalade soon after and Ford kept driving. There is no indication that any of these staffers contacted police with concerns Ford was drinking and driving. The police document also describes how Ford called three staffers \"Liberal bitches\" and \"Liberal hacks.\" At a city council meeting yesterday, councilors asked Ford to take a leave of absence to deal with his drinking and other problems.

It's unclear how long after that final approval would come. The move comes amidst a rapidly changing legal landscape around online gambling. Nevada became the first state to legalize online poker earlier this year. Though it has handed out a few licenses already, none of the companies' online poker games is up and running yet. And when they are, they'll be limited to state residents. But that could soon change: Harry Reid and Jon Kyl are working on a bill that would legalize online poker nationwide and even create an Office of Online Poker Oversight, the Journal reported yesterday. However, the bill would simultaneously ban most other forms of online gambling.",

Fifteen years later, DNA evidence cleared him of all three, and last month, the Los Angeles Superior Court overturned his conviction, the New York Times reports. Vargas, who was 13 at the time of the attacks, had received a teardrop tattoo as a homeless 13-year-old, according to the California Innocence Project, which helped free him after discovering his conviction was linked to a serial rapist known as the \"Tear Drop Rapist.\" The rapes Vargas was convicted of occurred within a 1.6-mile radius of the three attacks, and all three victims described the attacker as a small, Hispanic male with one or two teardrop tattoos under his eye. His conviction was based solely on the testimony of three victims, who changed their stories over the years. But the prosecution's case was weak, and the defense chose not to offer an eyewitness identification expert. When DNA testing came to light, the DA's office agreed to release Vargas to federal custody. \"I will pray for God's mercy on all of you,\" Vargas told the court before his sentence was handed down. \"But as far as I'm concerned ... an individual really did these crimes might really be raping someone out there.\" Vargas, 46, was taken back into custody when his green card was revoked when his conviction for the crimes was overturned.

According to a study published Wednesday in Current Biology, the dinosaur's tail was found preserved in semitranslucent amber, which is about the size of a dried apricot. Inside the lump of resin was a 1.4-inch appendage covered in feathers, and CT scans revealed eight vertebrae from the middle or end of a long, thin tail that may have been originally made up of more than 25 vertebrae. Modern birds and their closest ancestors feature a set of fused tail vertebrae called a pygostyle that enables tail feathers to move as a single unit. \" is the sort of thing you've seen if you're ever prepared a turkey,\" study co-author Ryan McKellar says in a press release. Researchers believe the tail feathers belong to a juvenile coelurosaur, part of a group of oviraptorosaurs that includes everything from tyrannosaurs to modern birds. It's believed to be the first known fossil of a feathered dinosaur in the US. The fossil was found in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah, National Geographic reports. \"This means you\u2019re firmly in dinosaur territory, as opposed to bird territory,\" McKellars says. \"The fact that is still present gives us a lot of hope for future analysis to obtain other chemical information things like, like, pigmentation or even to identify parts of the original keratin.\" (Scientists recently discovered a previously undiscovered dinosaur may have the ability to fly.)",

The find was published Thursday in Current Biology. The tail section is believed to belong to a young, sparrow-sized coelurosaur that lived 99 million years ago. Researchers know the tail belongs to a dinosaur because of its articulated vertebrae; birds have vertebrae that are fused together. And because of the way the features are structured, researchers believe they were useless for flight. It remains unclear exactly what purpose the feathers served, though researchers theorize dinosaurs may have used them for camouflage, regulating their body heat, or signaling to other animals.

All that activity can lead to dreamed situations that feel very real\u2014in some cases, even religious. In a new paper in Frontiers in Psychology, a neurologist and theological scholar argue that dreams are well-suited to create experiences in which we believe we've spoken to a deity of some kind.

What's more, in dreams, we often ascribe emotions and thoughts to those we believe we're encountering. We give them an \"exaggerated degree of agency\" because our dreaming brains have trouble understanding our thoughts as our own, the researchers write.

The victim's family is suing the camp, as well as the Baptist General Convention of Oklahoma, claiming the churches failed to do a good enough job of checking the backgrounds of workers and supervise participants. The lawsuit claims the rape itself is responsible for the girl, who was attending the camp with a group from Terrell, Texas, the AP reports. The victim says Petty told her he was going to show her how to perform tricks on a device he brought to the camp when he suddenly pulled her into his cabin. \"Petty closed the door to his bedroom, tied hands behind her back, pulled down her jeans, pushed her face down on his bed, and violently raped and sodomized her,\" court documents state. Per NewsOK, Petty tied a rope around the girl's wrists, raped her, and threatened to hurt her if she told anyone. A rep for the Oklahoma Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault says the sentence sends the wrong message to victims: \"Failure to hold perpetrators accountable regardless of their disabilities.",

A notice of intent to recall Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky was filed with the Santa Clara County registrar of voters on Monday, the San Jose Mercury News reports. The recall campaign, led by Stanford law professor Michele Dauber, aims to get 58,634 valid voter signatures within 160 days of the filing of the notice to qualify the measure for the June 2018 countywide ballot. If they're able to get that number, the recall will move on to the formal petition process, which will begin in August, when the signatures will need to be verified by the county registrar. Persky, who was transferred to civil court at his own request last summer, was widely criticized for his lenient sentence in the case of Brock Turner, who received six months in prison after being found guilty of assault with the intent to commit rape of an unconscious person and sexual penetration of an intoxicated person. Proponents say that's too light and that Persky has a \"long history of awarding lenient sentences to athletes and upper-class defendants for sex crimes and violence against women.\" Persky is supported by dozens of law school professors, including 11 who teach at Stanford, who say the recall would set a dangerous precedent. \"Every judge has made an unpopular decision; judicial recalls are an extreme step that should be reserved for,\" they write in a letter to the Mercury News.",

He tells Playbill that it wasn't a joke and that he wasn't acting on a dare. He just needed to charge his iPhone. \"I saw the outlet and ran for it,\" he recalls. \"That was the only outlet I saw, so I thought, 'Why not?' I was thinking that they were probably going to plug something in there on the set, and I figured it wouldn't be a big deal if my phone was up there too.\" Security guards quickly moved in. After talking to Playbill, Silvestri even participated in a press conference and read a statement in which he apologized. \"I don't go to plays very much, and I didn't realize that the stage is considered off limits,\" he said, per Gothamist.

The second incident occurred when Patti LuPone took the phone from an audience member who was texting during Show for Days.

Researchers looked at data from 1993 to 2012 and found that the suicide rate for black children rose from 1.36 per million to 2.54 per million, while the rate for white children fell from 1.14 to 0.77, the New York Times reports. Hanging/suffocation was the most common method of death for black boys, with a rate of 1.35 per million compared to 1.14 million for white boys. The study's lead author, Dr. Nancy Kalish, tells the Times that the findings suggest that \"prevention efforts in children younger than 12 years should be more focused on black and Latino communities.\" She says the findings should be a wake-up call for public health officials, especially since black children are still more likely than whites to die from gun violence. Kalish says black children who are bullied or teased may also be at higher risk of suicide. Researchers say the reason for the increased suicide rate in black boys is unclear, but they suspect it may have something to do with the fact that they are less likely to get the medical care and support they need, the Times notes. In the study, researchers also looked at other suicide methods, including hanging, and found they didn't change during the study.",

But while the suicide rate remained stable during that time, \"that stability obscured racial differences,\" observes Psych Central. The suicide rate decreased in white children, but increased significantly in black children, from from 1.36 to 2.54 per 1 million between the study's first five years and its last five. (In white children, the shift was from 1.14 to 0.77.) That shot suicide up from No. 14 on the list of causes of death among black kids of this age to No. 9; it's No. 11 for white kids. The researchers noted that 84% of those who committed suicide were boys and just 16% girls, and the rate worsens when viewed through a gender lens as well. For black boys, the rate climbed to 3.47 per million. The findings represent a big shift, per lead author Jeffrey Bridge. \"Historically, the suicide rate among US black individuals has been lower than that of white individuals across age groups,\" reads the study. \"To our knowledge, this is the first national study to observe higher suicide rates among US black individuals compared with white individuals.\" Hanging and suffocation were the main methods for young children.

The rat also has \"unusually long\" surfaces on its articular surfaces, according to a study published in the journal Zootaxa. It's also similar to other Sulawesi rats\u2014known as \"hrews rats\"\u2014in that they're long-haired, have large ears, and are similar in appearance to mice. The species was found on Mount Dako, which the Guardian notes is \"one of the most active volcanoes in the world\" and is also home to a variety of mammals, including elephants, rhinos, and giraffes. The paper's lead author, a professor of entomology at the University of Bristol, tells the BBC that the discovery of the new species is \"remarkable\" because it adds to the more than 50 rat species already known to exist on the island.",

Co-author Kevin Rowe tells Mashable Australia that it's unclear what purpose the hair serves, though \"it probably helps it in some kind of reproductive way. Both males and females have those long ... hairs, like whiskers. They're not like human pubic hairs.\" Among its other features: Rowe explains that the 18-inch-long rat's mouth opening is so narrow that it can't open it much. \"It probably eats worms and insect larvae, just kind of slurping them up.\" (In line with that slurping, it also lacks the coronoid process on the dentary bone, which other mammals rely on to chew.) KNOE reports it's the third genus newly identified by the international team since 2012 (here's another of the team's finds), and recalls the moment the rat was found\u2014twice. Rowe, of Museum Victoria, and LSU Museum of Natural Science Curator of Mammals Jake Esselstyn went to check their respective traps, saw what was clear to them was a new species, \"came back to camp and were both surprised that the other one had it as well.\" The rodent was given the name Hyorhinomys stuempkei, which the Age translates from the Greek as \"'hyo' meaning hog, 'rhino' meaning nose and 'mys' meaning rat.\" (Another unusual animal-related find: a mysterious, giant, jellylike \"thing.\")",

The monk, Itigilov, was found dead in the lotus position in his tomb in 1936, but authorities didn't know what to do with his body after he was reburied in 1939. It was discovered again in 2002 and remained in his crypt for the next 75 years. \"To me, it is the greatest miracle in life,\" spiritual leader Hambo Lama Ayusheyev said at the time. \"It turns out there are things on which time has no power.\" Now, 13 years after the discovery, authorities say the monk's body was stolen from another part of the country and had been planned for sale on the black market, with local media claiming he wanted to take it over the Mongolian border. A 45-year-old man was arrested after police uncovered the plot and \"quickly arrested\" him, according to the Times. It's not clear how the corpse was stolen, but \"police have revealed that the monk had been stolen and was about to be sold off,\" the paper says. \"He had then been planning to sell it.\" Buddhist expert Barry Kerzin tells the Telegraph the monk is in a state of meditation called \"tukdam,\" or \"one stage away from becoming a real-life Buddha.\" \"If the meditator can continue to stay in this meditative state, he can become a Buddha,\" says Kerzin, who is the physician of the Dalai Lama, who says the monk was the only the only a religious practice.

Dr. Barry Kerzin, a famous fellow monk who is also a physician to the Dalai Lama, tells the Siberian Times that monks in this state go into \"very deep meditation\" and, if they can stay in such a state for more than three weeks, their bodies shrink until all that remains are \"hair, nails, and clothes,\" he says. \"Usually in this case, people who live next to the monk see a rainbow that glows in the sky for several days. This means that he has found a 'rainbow body.' This is the highest state close to the state of Buddha,\" and someone who remains in the state can even become a Buddha, he says. He adds that over the past five decades, there have been 40 such cases in India. Ganhugiyn Purevbata, founder and professor at the Mongolian Institute of Buddhist Art at Ulaanbaatar Buddhist University, agrees: The monk \"is sitting in the lotus position vajra, the left hand is opened, and the right hand symbolizes of the preaching Sutra,\" he says. \"This is a sign that the Lama is not dead, but is in a very deep meditation according to the ancient tradition of Buddhist lamas.\" But scientists have a different take, theorizing that the cold weather in Mongolia, where the monk was found, helped preserve him, the BBC reports. And the Washington Post notes that such \"accidental mummies\" have been discovered in freezing climates before, like a 9,000-year-old mummified bison in Siberia. Meanwhile, there is drama of a less spiritual type unfolding: Police say a man stole the monk from a cave in another part of the country and was planning to sell him on the black market, but police learned of the plot, recovered the monk, and arrested the man for smuggling.

Archbishop Charles Chaput issued the new guidelines Friday in response to Pope Francis' Amoris Laetitia, a document on family values issued in April. Chaput says it is a \"hard teaching\" but it is also a \"positive one.\" The guidelines state that Catholics in same-sex partnerships, those remarried without an annulment, and cohabitating couples are not allowed to serve on parish councils, serve as lectors, or dispense Communion. \"No matter how sincere,\" it would \"offer a serious counter-witness to Catholic belief, which can only produce moral confusion in the community,\" the Inquirer quotes Chaput as saying. The pope is \"clearly open to the possibility of divorced and remarried Catholics receiving Holy Communion,\" a National Catholic Reporter columnist tells the Inquirer, \"but I think he'd also leave this to the discretion of the local bishop, which means that Chaput can do what he wants in his diocese, but a neighboring bishop may take a much more open position.\"",

But divorcees aren't the only ones Chaput wants to see living without sex. People in same-sex relationships and straight couples who aren't married must also go sexless. Fortunately, the new guidelines explain that anyone can be in a successful heterosexual marriage with kids even with \"some degree of same-sex attraction.\" The guidelines, which come from one of the most conservative Catholic leaders in the US, also recommend priests try to break up couples who aren't interested in getting married, which shows they're \"lacking in maturity,\" and claims same-sex relationships will \"produce moral confusion in the community.\" Anyone going against the guidelines should not receive Holy Communion and should be barred from positions of responsibility within the church.

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 India chose an \"untouchable\" as its next president Thursday after the first contest in which both candidates were from the lowest tier of the country's caste system. Ram Nath Kovind, nominated by the ruling BJP party, had been clear favorite for the largely ceremonial post, which is decided by 4,800 lawmakers across the country. Under India's constitution, the prime minister and his ministers wield executive power but the president sometimes plays a role such as deciding which party should form a government if a general election is inconclusive. Kovind is not the first president to be \"Dalit,\" a term that means \"oppressed\" in Sanskrit and refers to members of the lowest caste. Kocheril Ramanan took office in 1997 more than half a century after Gandhi pledged to end the country\u2019s ancient system of discrimination. It is, however, the first time since India gained independence from Britain in 1947 that both the final candidates were Dalit\u2014former diplomat Meira Kumar was also low-caste\u2014and it is also the first times that the upper-Caste dominated BJP has nominated a Dalit for the job. One-fifth of all parliamentary candidates must be Dalit under decades-long affirmative-action laws introduced to improve representation and outlaw discrimination. The Guardian reports that Kovind's election is widely seen as part of a strategy by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to widen support among the 200 million-strong Dalit community. Dalits, who are often referred to as untouchables, occupy the lowest rung of the caste system, which still sees them as \"impure.\"",

In India, the real power is with the prime minister. Kovind isn't actually the first Dalit president, the first coming in 1997, notes NBC News. In fact, one analyst tells the network that the real significance of the election isn't the caste factor but its reflection of the growing power of the ruling BJP Party. Both Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi belong to the BJP (which is why the election was never really in doubt), and Modi's blessing of Kovind is seen as a calculated strategy to woo other members of the 200-million-strong Dalit community. \"Dalit politics suddenly has come center stage with a bang,\" another analyst tells the New York Times. \"Every leader is bending over backward to show, 'I am a well-wisher.'\" India elects its vice president next month, and BJP is counting on another win to cement its influence over Parliament.",

The lawsuit asks a judge to block the administration from enforcing three new conditions it included in applications for Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant money, which the city uses to help buy police cars, purchase other equipment, and fund an anti-violence program. Those applications are due Sept. 5, and the city wants a court order before the deadline, says Corporation Counsel Ed Siskel. The new conditions outlined by Sessions' Justice Department: sharing immigration status information with federal officials enforcing deportation laws, providing unlimited police station access to those officials, and giving them 48-hour notice of an arrested person's release in cases of potential immigration violations. The city says Congress didn't give the DOJ the power to create new conditions when it created the grant program, and it argues that the conditions are unconstitutional. \"The federal government's focus on enforcing the law would require a 'reordering of law enforcement practice in Chicago,'\" the lawsuit reads, per the Chicago Sun-Times. \"But that's just what Chicago needs: a recommitment to the rule of law and to policies that roll back the culture of lawlessness that has beset the city.\"",

That's the conclusion of a new study published in Scientific Reports, which looked at the \"secure attachment\"\u2014or lack thereof\u2014of cats between their owners and strangers. The study's participants were split into three groups: one that was left with its owner for six minutes, one that had a stranger stay with it for three minutes, and one that hadn't been left alone for as long as three minutes. Afterward, the cats were tested for signs of attachment. \"The results of our study suggest that the typical bond between a cat and its owner may be much stronger than has been previously reported,\" says lead researcher Daniel Mills in a press release. Previous research has suggested that some cats show signs of separation anxiety when left alone by their owners, \"in the same.\" To test this, researchers had owners bring their cats to a lab that had been set up to look like a house, and then had the cats. When the owners left the room, cats would hide in a box or under a bed while the owner was away. But when the owner wasn't home, the vocalizations of the cats weren't the same as if they were with their owner or a stranger. This study is the first of its kind to test whether a cat's level of attachment is affected by its environment.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 There are a lot of cats in the United States. Perhaps close to 95 million live with us as pets, reports the Times-Picayune. But does our affection for these feline friends move in just one direction? New research in the journal PLoS One suggests that domesticated cats are more independent than dogs because they have less \"secure attachment\" to their owners. In this case, attachment \"is not simply an affectionate bond,\" the researchers write, but relates to \"the carer being perceived as a focus of safety and security in otherwise threatening environments.\" Past research has indicated that some cats whose owners leave them alone display signs of separation anxiety, as dogs do. \"But the results of our study show that they are in fact much more independent than canine companions,\" says lead researcher Daniel Mills. \"It seems that what we interpret as separation anxiety might actually be signs of frustration.\" Behavioral scientists at the University of Lincoln in the UK tested this by observing cats in unfamiliar environments with their owners, with strangers, and alone. They were looking for three distinct characteristics of attachment: the amount of contact a cat sought, its level of passive behavior, and its distress when the owner was absent. Cats were, it turns out, more vocal when their owners left them than when strangers did, but they demonstrated no other signs of attachment, hence the possibility that the vocalization was not one of longing; the researchers posit it could indicate frustration or just be a \"learned response.\" \"Our findings don\u2019t disagree with the notion that cats develop social preferences or close relationships,\" says Mills, \"but they do show that these relationships do not appear to be typically based on a need for safety and security.\" (One woman's attempt to rescue her cat from a cliff didn't go so well.)",

The black boxes will be sent to the Netherlands for examination, reports the BBC, which notes that it's not clear whether they can be used to determine the cause of the crash. The chief investigator for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe tells the AP that he believes pro-Russian separatists shot the plane down with an SA-11 surface-to-air missile system brought in by a Russian-supplied truck. \"It was an act of war,\" he says. \"We don't know how it happened, but we know that it was a Russian Buk system.\" Russia has denied supplying the missile system, but today offered what the Wall Street Journal calls a \"first detailed version\" of events. Russia's defense minister didn't offer any photographic, radar, or satellite evidence to back up the claim, but he presented a graphic showing four commercial planes in the area just before the crash, as well as what he said was likely a Ukrainian fighter jet.

At an official briefing last night, the defense ministry said that its radar spotted a second aircraft in the vicinity and that it was probably a Ukraine fighter jet, which could have shot down the plane. The air force chief also suggested that a Ukraine missile system could have hit the plane from the ground, and he said satellite imagery suggested that Ukraine had been moving such systems into the area. He offered no proof, but as Katie Stallard at Sky News writes, \"Russia doesn't need to prove its case\u2014all it needs is to create one, to insist that there are different versions of events, that there is credible claim and counter-claim.\" Meanwhile, the refrigerated train carrying passengers arrived in the Ukraine town of Kharkiv, reports the AP.

But in recent years, they've been dropping their out-of-the-blue bets on the stock market and investing instead in index funds that track market indexes. The New York Times takes a look at the unusual move by the state's chief investment officer, Steve Edmundson, and his predecessor, Ken Lambert, who have since January 2014 switched the last of the pension funds' stock and bond investments entirely into securities that track the market indexes exactly. \"The knock on index funds and similar strategies has always been that the smart money knew better,\" writes Megan McArdle. \" Endowments, foundation money, pension funds\u2014their managers had the wisdom and connections to find investments that outperform the market, or investors with the magic touch. The fact that they could supposedly do it (though they often couldn't) seemed to serve as a sort of challenge to individual investors, who took up trading as a hobby and bought and sold their way to unfortunate losses.\" So how did they do it? By ceasing to place outsize bets on companies, industries, or countries, the men also eliminate the temptation to focus too much on the short.

Where other states' retirement systems try to come up with the most complex investments possible to beat the markets, the 44-year-old Edmundson has a different philosophy when it comes to day-to-day trading: \"Do as little as possible, usually nothing,\" as the Journal puts it. And by \"nothing,\" that means not obsessing over the daily fluctuations in oil prices, the elections, or even what Janet Yellen is up to\u2014an approach that's rare among managers of large pension funds, the New York Times noted last year in an article about Edmundson. This laissez-faire tactic has served Edmundson well: His system's returns over anywhere from one to 10 years are competitive, if not better, than the pension systems of other states, including the largest public one\u2014California's. Even Edmundson's desk looks like it's his first day on the job, with just basic office supplies, a few family pics, and a printer\u2014no fancy Bloomberg Terminal to monitor real-time market info. Edmundson is able to kick back by keeping the system's stocks and bonds in low-cost index funds, though one investment strategy expert (who held the job before Edmundson) concedes \"doing nothing is harder than it looks\" when it comes to showing such restraint.

His other regular characters include Otto, Smithers, and Dr. Hibbert, as well as more rarely seen ones like Satan, Adolf Hitler, Bill Clinton, and George Bush, according to his website.

Brooks as saying \"show will go on, Harry will not be part of it, wish him the best.\" Shearer added: \"This because I wanted what we've always had: the freedom to do other work\" and thanked Simpsons fans for their support.

The New York Times reports on the study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which looked at recordings made by the AP of the sounds the diplomats reported hearing and concluded they were caused by the interaction of two ultrasound beams. If that's the case, it \"would rule out the microwave auditory effect where the microwave-induced vibrations exist only within the head,\" per the Times.

Yan's team says it's \"reasonable to guess the sounds were inadvertently produced by ultrasound devices, possibly even spy tech, but without malicious intent against the embassy personnel.\" A senior administration official tells CNN that ultrasound and infrasound are also being investigated as possible causes. The official says investigators have torn apart buildings where diplomats encountered the sounds but found no acoustic devices, leading law enforcement to believe that the injuries were the result of microwaves beamed from a nearby location and that the \"sounds\" were merely.

Kenneth Foster is a professor of bioengineering at Penn who explained the auditory effect in a 1974 study. At Scientific American, he assesses what's known about the Cuban ailments and lays out why it's \"wildly implausible\" that microwaves are to blame. For one thing, any such weapon powerful enough to cause brain damage would almost certainly burn the victims, too, and that didn't happen. Instead, Foster suggests that a much simpler explanation is likely. \"It is reasonable to guess the sounds were inadvertently produced by ultrasound devices, possibly even spytech, but without malicious intent against the embassy personnel,\" he writes. Foster cites this earlier investigation from the AP revealing the sounds that the victims are believed to have heard, and he says the sounds are consistent with ultrasound devices interacting with each other. It makes sense to him that the Cubans might have been trying to listen in on Americans with these relatively common gizmos. \"The incidents occurred about the time of the 2016 US election, and the Cubans undoubtedly were desperate for intelligence about US intentions.\" A Cuban scientist, meanwhile, agrees that the microwave theory is far-fetched. \"First, it was sonic weapons, now microwave,\" he told CNN. \"What's next, kryptonite?\"",

The younger Kaine was arrested on suspicion of second-degree rioting at the state Capitol, where cops say a group of 50 or so anti-Trump protesters raised a ruckus by blaring air horns, being verbally disruptive, setting off fireworks, and even a smoke bomb that reportedly hit a 61-year-old woman in the head when it was thrown into the crowd. A St. Paul police rep says \"some force\" was needed to haul \"Woody\" Kaine to the Ramsey County jail. He wasn't charged, nor were the others, though the St. Paul city attorney is looking into whether any misdemeanors are warranted. Kaine was released Tuesday morning while the case is further investigated. Per WCCO, the Minnesota Republican Party put out a statement Monday blaming Democrats for \"coordinating disruption and violence\" both during the election and afterward. The senator, meanwhile, issued his own statement to the Press, noting he and his wife \"love that our three children have their own views and concerns about current political issues,\" adding his kids know well how to \"express those concerns peacefully.\" (Tim Kaine once ran for his Senate seat against a cat.)",

A study published Tuesday in Circulation Research found that long-term exposure to PPIs \"accelerated biological aging in human endothelial cells which line the inside of blood vessels,\" according to a press release. When healthy cells create a Teflon-like coating that prevents blood from sticking, the endothelium becomes more like Velcro, with blood elements sticking to the vessel to form blockages. \"Lysosomes are like the garbage disposal of cells,\" says the study's lead author. \"They need to generate acid to get rid of cellular rubbish, and when cellular rubbish accumulates the cells age faster.\" The study found that one type of PPI, esomeprazole ( Nexium), impairs acid production by the lysosomes in the cells lining the blood vessel walls. In turn, the buildup of waste caused the cell to age faster. \"With the knowledge that PPIs are being used by millions of people for indications and durations that were never tested or approved, it may be time for the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory agencies to re-visit the specificity and the safety of these agents,\" the lead author says. \"Unless otherwise indicated, physicians should.\" Click for more.",

Their average age was 57, and six years later those taking one of four PPIs (Prilosec, Protonix, Prevacid, or Nexium) had a 21% higher risk of stroke than those not taking one. Lowest-dose PPIs didn't increase the risk much if at all, while highest-dose increased it, from 30% for Prevacid to 94% for Protonix. Another type of acid-lowering meds called H2 blockers (think Pepcid and Zantac) showed no elevated risk. \"As a culture, we tend to want a pill to deal with our problems, when a lot of people could reduce their heartburn by eating smaller meals, drinking less alcohol, or not smoking,\" one doc told CNN in 2010.

The former New York City mayor, who has been a leading voice on climate change issues, tells the New York Times that he has been in touch with a number of scientists, academics, and business leaders to see if there is a way for the US to continue reporting its greenhouse gas emissions to the United Nations while remaining a full party to the Paris accord. The Trump administration's withdrawal from the accord means the US will have to stop reporting its emissions for several years, but Bloomberg says that if it does continue to report, it will be doing so on a \"parallel\" basis with other countries, which would indicate the US is no longer leading the climate change fight at the federal level. The Times reports that it's not clear how the submission to the UN will be handled. Christiana Figueres, the former executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, says the submission could be included in future reports on the progress made by the 195 countries that signed the Paris agreement.",

On Friday, Bloomberg Philanthropies announced it would commit $15 million to \"support the operations\" of the UN's Framework Convention on Climate Change, which coordinates the Paris climate agreement, CNN reports. The $15 million will cover the US' share of the convention's operating budget. The executive secretary of the Framework Convention on Climate Change calls the money \"crucial.\" On Thursday, after announcing the US was withdrawing from the Paris agreement, President Trump said the money the US had pledged to give the UN for climate matters was a \"draconian\" burden on the country. Bloomberg says he believes the US can hit its 2025 emissions reduction target laid out in the Paris climate agreement without the help of the federal government. \"The bulk of the decisions which drive US climate action in the aggregate are made by cities, states, businesses, and civil society,\" the New York Times quotes Bloomberg as saying in a letter to the UN secretary-general.

The problem is that red meat contains a protein linked to a sugar molecule called galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose, or alpha-gal, which can cause a life-threatening reaction in people. For years, physicians and researchers only reported the allergy in places the lone star ticks call home, namely the southeastern US. But recently it's started to spread. Duluth, Minnesota, Hanover, New Hampshire, and the eastern tip of Long Island, where at least 100 cases have been reported in the last year. Scientists are racing to trace its spread, to understand if the lone Star tick is expanding into new territories, or if other species of ticks are now causing the allergy. The best guess is that something in the tick's saliva hijacks humans' immune systems and triggers the massive release of histamines whenever red meat is consumed. \"Just a few bites and you can render anyone really, really allergic,\" says an asthma and allergy fellow at the University of North Carolina, who's working on a cure. Wired has more.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Ticks are out in force this year, and there's one species in particular you should watch out for if you'd ever like to eat meat again. Experts say the lone star tick appears to be spreading from its home base in the southeastern US. Whereas other ticks can spread ailments such as Lyme disease, the lone star tick is bothersome because it is believed to trigger a potentially life-threatening and apparently lifelong meat allergy with its bite. The tick doesn't technically make people allergic to meat, but rather to a sugar molecule found in red meat known as alpha-gal. This alpha-gal allergy has typically been limited to the southeastern US, where the lone star tick is prevalent, but no more, reports Wired. Cases\u2014in which the consumption of meat can result in hives, difficulty breathing, or death\u2014have been reported in Minnesota, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and New York, per Inverse. Long Island has seen at least 100 cases in the last year. Researchers suspect the spread of the allergy coincides with the spread of lone star ticks, though it's also possible that other ticks are responsible. Either way, \"the nuisance level [for lone star ticks] is much higher than the black-legged tick,\" an expert tells the Weston Forum. \"It is aggressive and very abundant.\" Researchers are currently studying the effect of a lone star tick bite on mice to determine why it triggers the allergy.

In a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, Oregon Health & Science University researcher Shoukhrat Mitalipov and his team used a new DNA-editing technique called Crispr-Cas9 to correct a genetic mutation that causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or HCM, the most common inherited cardiac disease and the leading cause of death in athletes. They used sperm from a man with the mutation and 12 healthy women who had donated eggs for the research. They were also able to fix the mutation in only one of the embryos. If the results are confirmed, it would be the first time DNA was edited in a human embryo\u2014meaning one man and one woman will be the biological parents of the baby. The South Korean woman had a miscarriage, and the embryo was then implanted into a woman who became pregnant and had a healthy baby with no mutations, reports the New York Times. Russell Cruzan III is one of only a few children in the world with a condition similar to the one that led to the death of a 1-year-old boy in the UK earlier this month, WOOD-TV reports. His parents, who live in Springfield, Ore., are trying to raise money for research so that other families with children with the disease won't have to suffer the same fate.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Mitochondrial diseases afflict an estimated one in 4,000 people, most notably in the recent high-profile case of Charlie Gard in the UK, whose parents unsuccessfully sought to transport him to the US for experimental treatment. The fault lies in mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited from mothers and is responsible for powering every cell in the body, per Quartz. Now a 5-month-old baby in Michigan has been diagnosed with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 13, which claimed the life of Gard last week. His parents will attempt experimental treatment in Boston, they tell NewsChannel3. With only a 50% chance of reaching his second birthday, they say at least their baby might \"help other children with this condition.\" Russell Cruzan III, or \"Bubs,\" first worried his parents in early June, when they wondered why he wasn't eating or thriving and was lethargic. After several hospital visits, respiratory problems, and eventually pneumonia, they got the grim diagnosis: His body lacked the energy to power his major organs. The couple doesn't have help from their insurance provider, per WOOD TV, so they've set up a YouCaring page to help with the initial test. This is the type of disease that geneticists hope to be able to stop in its tracks using so-called three-parent IVF, where a donor egg supplies a healthy set of mitochondrial DNA (37 genes) and the biological mother supplies her egg's nucleus (thousands of genes) without passing on mitochondrial diseases.

Researchers at Lancaster University in the UK say the drug, called erenumab, slowed the progression of the disease in mice by blocking a protein that clogs the brain with abnormal proteins. \"This finding, I suspect, will be judged by history as a turning point in the search for medicines to control and prevent Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\" a professor of neuroscience tells the Telegraph. \"If this process is also working overtime in these conditions, targeting it could be a promising avenue for investigation.\" The drug, which is still in the early stages of development, targeted the harmful way brain cells react to misfolded proteins. Using a drug injected into the stomachs of mice through a mouth tube, they flipped a cellular switch from \"off\" to \"on\" to prevent neurons dying. Five weeks after treatment one group of mice remained free of symptoms such as memory loss, impaired reflexes, and limb dragging. They also lived longer than untreated animals with the same brain disease. The study focused on the root cause of many brain diseases\u2014 abnormally shaped proteins that stick together in clumps and fibers. When enough misshapen protein builds up in the brain, it can trigger a reaction that results in the death of nerve cells. Other approaches have sought to stop or limit the accumulation of the abnormal protein, whose structure is folded the wrong way. \"However, what is true in animals does not always hold true in people, and the ultimate test for this compound will be a true test,\" the lead researcher tells the Independent.",

The compound blocks the faulty brain signal that causes the initial \"shutdown,\" thus basically flipping the switch from \"off\" back to \"on.\" Proteins are produced, brain cells are protected, and symptoms are reversed. The mice in the study had prion disease, which is similar to a human neurodegenerative disorder. After receiving the compound, memory loss and other symptoms including impaired reflexes and limb dragging were reversed; the treated mice also lived longer than those who didn't receive the compound, Sky News reports. Though it's still a long way off, scientists think a treatment based on these findings could also help people with Parkinson's disease.

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 The Pacific sardine fishery is in the midst of what the Los Angeles Times calls the \"biggest sardine crash in generations.\" The small, energy-rich fish used to be a staple on the West Coast, but they're down 72% since their last peak in 2006, and scientists say the effects are rippling through the ecosystem, starving brown pelicans, sea lions, and other predators that rely on the oily fish for food. The decline has prompted steep cuts in the amount fishermen are allowed to catch, and federal fishery managers slashed harvest limits by more than two-thirds in November. Sardines are famously volatile, but the decline is the steepest since the sardine fishery in the mid-20th century. And their numbers are projected to keep sliding. One factor is a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which in recent years has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West coast. While those conditions have brought a boom in some species, such as market squid, they have repelled sardines. If nature is responsible for the decline, history shows the fish will bounce back when ocean conditions improve. But without a full understanding of the causes, the crash is raising alarm. Sea lions are starving to death because they don't have enough sardines to eat, National Marine Fisheries Service researchers say. The theory is based on new research that found sea lion mothers couldn't find the fatty fish, so they fed on squid, rockfish, and hake instead. \" sardines are one of the most cautiously fished in the world,\" says a NOAA official.",

One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans\u2014which also depend on sardines for food\u2014are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)\u2014and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing. Last month, Pew Charitable Trusts warned that dozens of species, including whales, sharks, dolphins, salmon, and tuna, could feel an impact.",

It landed back at Singapore's Changi Airport more then four hours later\u2014and just after it came to a halt, its right engine burst into flames as horrified passengers looked on. \"By the time the fire engines reached the plane, the flames were about a meter high,\" passenger Amit Jain tells Today. \"When we could see the flames rising, some people were trying to remove their bags from the overhead compartments, which was crazy,\" he says. \"I heard a few people scream 'Open the doors!' and 'Let us out!'\" The airline and the airport say the blaze was extinguished within minutes, CNN reports. The passengers were transferred to another flight to Milan. Passengers say they could smell oil while the plane was in the air, but they didn't realize how close to death they were until afterward, the BBC reports.

Reid was sent on the more advanced hike with only two other teenagers, not the required two adults. The lawsuit claims Reid was \"sent on an extremely aggressive hike\" in temperatures that reached 100 degrees with a heat index well over that. It also claims the camp didn't provide proper training before sending Reid on the hike, and that the family was not notified of his death for more than four hours. \"It doesn't take it away.

The boy's dad smelled a rat. He accused Davis of disqualifying his son's team so the second- and third-place teams, which bowl at lanes owned by Davis, could take higher honors. Davis fired back that Powell was \"full aware of the dress code\" and sent his kid anyway. He pressed: \"What parent would do this?\" As the Guardian reports, one of Powell's complaints is that his son was disqualified only after bowling a 171-point game that propelled his Riverdale team to the title in the Newfoundland city of St. John's.\" After the story made headlines in Canada, an odd-sounding compromise was reached.

On the left is a fellow suicide bomber, still unidentified, and on the right is another suspect, clad in white, who remains at large. Some media reports have identified him as Najim Laachraoui, who is suspected of paying a role in the Paris attacks, but authorities have not officially identified Laachraoui as a suspect in Brussels. Ibrahim El Bakraoui's brother, Khalid, 27, meanwhile, is accused of detonating a suicide bomb on the Brussels subway train. In another development, a Turkish official says Ibrahim El Bakraoui was arrested in June at the Turkey-Syria border and deported to the Netherlands. Turkey then warned both the Netherlands and Belgium that he was a \"foreign terrorist fighter,\" reports AP.",

Here's what critics are saying: \"The Emoji Movie is not a soul-crushing disaster simply because its dramatis personae are the range of emotive faces and symbols that live inside your cell phone,\" writes Adam Graham at the Detroit News. \"It is a Soul-crushing Disaster because it lacks humor, wit, ideas, visual style, compelling performances, a point of view or any other distinguishing characteristic that would make it anything but.\" \"In the mock tradition of countless superior films before it, it's attempting to sell a sense of childlike wonder and fascination with an ordinary, everyday object: your smartphone,\" writes Joe Morgenstern at the Wall Street Journal. \"And in doing so, it is one of the darkest, most dismaying films I have ever seen, much less one ostensibly made for children.\" \"This is a film that seems beamed from a near future in which nothing goes right; 'words,' as the kids in the film agree, 'aren't cool' anymore; and Patrick Stewart making jokes about soft s--- is the new prestige TV,\" writes Kenneth Turan at the Los Angeles Times.",

Here are some of the best takedowns of the new animated film: \"Children should not be allowed to watch The Emoji Movie,\" writes Charles Bramesco at the Guardian, calling it a \"sponsored-content post masquerading as a feature film\" and a \"force of insidious evil.\" It somehow exists to get kids to buy apps without apparently understanding kids and how they actually use emojis. \"A viewer leaves The Emoji Movie a colder person,\" the reviewer concludes. \"Hear that? It's the end of the world,\" writes Johnny Oleksinsk at ithe New York Post after calling The Emoji Movie a \"new exercise in soulless branding.\" At Vulture, Emily Yoshida calls it \"one of the darkest, most dismaying films I have ever seen, much less one ostensibly made for children.\" The Emoji Movie is \"a very, very dumb thing\" full of moments that \"sound like they were written by ad agencies,\" according to the Hollywood Reporter, which laments that the film wasn't released \"via Snapchat, where it would vanish shortly after arrival. But even that wouldn't be fast enough.\" Finally, Alonso Duralde at the Wrap calls it a \"soul-crushing disaster\" and \"completely shrill and stupid.\" This \"complete waste of your time\" is without \"humor, wit, ideas, visual style, compelling performances, a point of view, or any other distinguishing characteristic.\"",

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 If you live in Britain, Canada, Italy, or the Netherlands, your baby may be crying more than most babies around the world, according to new research out of the UK's University of Warwick. The findings, published in the Journal of Pediatrics, are based on a meta-analysis of studies involving 8,700 infants in countries including Germany, Denmark, Japan, and Canada. They found that babies cry for an average of two hours per day in the first two weeks of life, peaks at two hours 15 minutes at six weeks, and reduces to one hour 10 minutes by the 12th week. But some babies cry as little as 30 minutes per day, and others as much as five hours. The highest levels of colic\u2014crying more than three hours a day for at least three days a week\u2014were found in the UK, followed by Canada (34.1% at 3-4 weeks of age), and Italy (20.9% at 8-9 weeks). Denmark, Germany, and Japan, on the other hand, had the lowest rates of colic. \"Babies are already very different in how much they cry,\" says researcher Dieter Wolke. \"We may learn more from looking at cultures where there is less crying and whether this may be due to parenting or other factors relating to pregnancy experiences.\" Previous research has found that 40% of crying in babies is inconsolable, and Wolke blames \"unscientific\" parenting books for undue stress.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 New research into the amount of time that infants in various countries spend crying found that the littlest ones in usually placid Canada were the most colicky. British babies came in second, followed by Italy. The most tranquil tots, meanwhile, live in Denmark and Germany. Writing in the Journal of Pediatrics, psychologists at the University of Warwick analyzed 28 previous studies of some 8,700 infants to measure colic\u2014a harmless, if nerve-jangling, condition\u2014by gauging crying times during the first 12 weeks. The longest crying jags were clocked in Canada, reports the Guardian, where 34.1% of babies wailed more than three hours a day, at least three days a week. In the UK, the tally was 28% and in Italy 20.9%. Relatively blissful Danish babes scored 5.5%, with Germany at 6.7%. The first-of-its kind analysis found that babies the world over cry around two hours a day for the first weeks, peaking at two hours and 15 minutes at six weeks. Happily for stressed-out new parents everywhere, crying time is halved by week 12, per a press release. Lead researcher Dieter Wolke says parents in countries with low colic scores are less likely to intervene when baby starts crying, allowing the infant to self-soothe. \"They don\u2019t get all worried about it,\" Wolke tells the Telegraph. Then again, he notes, Danish babies may enjoy a bit of \"genetic bias\" since their country consistently ranks at the top of wellness surveys.

For men, the risk was 23% lower. The study did not prove chocolate causes atrial fibrillation or that chocolate is the culprit, but researchers suggest that chocolate has more cocoa content and that compounds in chocolate called flavonoids may help prevent the heart's electrical remodeling that leads to atrial fibrillation. \"As part of a healthy diet, moderate intake of chocolate is a healthy snack choice,\" says the lead author, per Reuters.",

Regularly eating chocolate could possibly help prevent a type of irregular heartbeat that can increase the risk of heart failure, strokes, and cognitive impairment, according to a study published Tuesday in Heart. Live Science reports between 2.7 million and 6.1 million Americans have atrial fibrillation, in which the upper chambers of the heart beat at a different pace than the lower chambers. But a study of 55,000 adults in Denmark found that those who ate chocolate at least once a month had rates of atrial fibrillation 10% to 20% lower than those who ate it less than once a month. The best results came from eating an ounce of chocolate two to six times per week. It's impossible to say based on the study whether chocolate consumption was directly responsible for lower rates of atrial fibrillation. Researchers also aren't clear how chocolate could even affect the development of the condition, but it may have something to do with things called flavanols, the Los Angeles Times reports. Atrial fibrillation is thought to be caused by molecules damaging heart tissue. The flavanols in chocolate can stop inflammation that leads to tissue damage. \"As part of a healthy diet, moderate intake of chocolate is a healthy snack choice,\" Reuters quotes the study's lead author as saying.

Dianne Feinstein, accusing them of interfering with federal immigration efforts by passing and enforcing state laws that hinder US operations against undocumented people, the AP reports. The lawsuit states that the Constitution gives the US government sweeping authority over immigration and accuses California of blocking enforcement efforts by the Department of Homeland Security and imposing other, impermissible obligations on the federal government. One of the laws under federal challenge bars private employers from voluntarily cooperating with immigration officials and requires businesses to notify workers in advance of a federal raid. A second law restricts state and local law enforcement from voluntarily sharing information with the feds about the release dates of undocumented people in their custody. The third law covers state inspections of detention facilities that hold noncitizens in federal custody.

Specifically, the report says the department didn't tell the public that the attack was a protest over an anti-Islam video until almost an hour after it began. The report also says the military never deployed to Benghazi because the Marines had already changed in and out of their uniforms four times as they prepared to deploy, reports the New York Times. Other highlights from the report: Hillary Clinton called an emergency conference call with defense and State Department officials on the night of the attack to discuss how to get Americans out of harm's way, and half of the action items people wrote down in the meeting didn\u2019t have to do with evacuation. \"The administration, including Secretary Clinton, knew that Benghazi was a terrorist attack\u2014from witness accounts, from their understanding of the history of violence in Benghazi,\" writes the Times. \"Yet, they led the public to believe the video and a protest were to blame.\" Rep. Elijah Cummings tells MSNBC the report is \"one of the saddest exercises I've ever engaged in in my 20 years in Congress.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The Republican-led House Benghazi committee released its final report Tuesday after two years of investigations. The 800-page report lays out the committee's findings on the 2012 attacks in Libya that left four Americans dead. Here's what you need to know: Benghazi is \"unlikely to be a potent tool for weakening Clinton\" in the general election, as the committee and report have little credibility and aren't seen as serious by many, the Los Angeles Times reports. Easily distilling the massive report, the Washington Post lays out its five \"most serious accusations,\" including that the CIA \"missed warning signs\" and \"misread how dangerous Libya ... was at the time.\" New evidence of \u201cculpability or wrongdoing\u201d on Clinton's part is lacking in the report, despite it being \u201cone of the longest, costliest, and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history,\" according to the New York Times. Given a lack of new evidence against Clinton, the Weekly Standard uses the report as a tool for blaming Obama. \u201cThe Obama administration knowingly provided the American people a false story about the Benghazi attack, its causes, and its consequences,\" the Standard states. How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed. According to the Hill, a Democratic lawmaker on the House Benghazi committee calls it \"one of the saddest exercises I've ever engaged in\" during 20 years in Congress. He accuses Republicans of hiding the final report from Democrats to avoid having it fact-checked. Zeroing in on what it calls the \"most revealing paragraph\" in the report, Vox concludes there's a pattern of spinning \"non-damning facts as damning\" for the Obama administration. The paragraph in question admits there were no US forces close enough to prevent the attack but insists that, in itself, was a failure on the part of the White House. \"I think it's time to move on,\" the AP quotes Clinton as saying after the release of the report, which she says includes nothing not previously discovered by an accountability board.",

The country's economy minister has promised he won't have appointments after 1pm on the so-called \"Premium Friday\" days, the BBC reports. The idea is to encourage workers to spend more time with family and friends, which has proven to be a hard sell in the past. \"Japanese workers worry about letting down their colleagues,\" the chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute says. \"They have a strong sense of working as a team.\" He says that private consumption could rise by $1.2 billion per Premium Friday if \"100%\" of workers showed up, though he warns that that could be a \"much smaller boost to the economy.\" Japan has long had a reputation for working long hours, with 22% of its population clocking more than 49 hours a week, behind South Korea's 35% and the US' 16%. Supporters of the plan say it will reduce work-related stress and give workers more time to spend with their families. But it will be a tough sell in a country where many family-run businesses are struggling to keep costs down. The Japan Business Federation has encouraged its members to sign up, but there are only around 1,300 companies in the country of more than 2.5 million, and even the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry hasn't indicated whether its workers will take part.",

The move isn't mandatory for companies, but the nation's biggest business lobby is on board and encouraging its members to take part when it launches on Feb. 24. It doesn't help that most workers in Japan tend to use only half their allotted paid time off, and that an estimated one in eight work 50 hours or more\u2014the highest percentage among G-7 nations. So it remains unclear whether Premium Friday will be a sufficient break for the overworked, or even attainable for those who must squeeze in their work at other times. Fortune is skeptical, calling it an \"essentially meaningless\" scheme. It quotes a critic who says the bigger issue to focus on is efficiency to cut down on those long work weeks, which are \"still considered a virtue.\" Another problem is that Japan has lots of small, family-run businesses where shortened hours could be a problem, notes the BBC.

There is still no running water or electricity. The city they are entering was until 48 hours ago their enemies' most important redoubt. With the rebel army regrouping, fears are growing of a similar, and perhaps even bloodier, siege in Donetsk, which, with a population of one million, is 10 times the size of Slavyansk.

He warned the cardinals who will elect his successor that \"the face of the church is at times disfigured by the sins against the unity of the Church and the divisions of the ecclesial body.\" He also made clear that he has no intention of interfering with his successor's work. The pope is expected to appoint the new chief of the Vatican bank, a move that would leave the next pontiff with a just-picked custodian to a secretive bank that, under Benedict, has denied allegations of money-laundering, the Journal notes. Benedict will give up all formal powers of his office, from the right to appoint bishops to the authority to issue infallible teachings, a Vatican spokesman says. But the ring that bears his office's seal will be smashed, paving the way for his successor to ascend the chair of Saint Peter. The former pope will continue to live inside Vatican City, where he will write and pray, according to Vatican officials. He will remain one of Roman Catholicism's leading theologians, an intellectual status that analysts and church officials say carries enormous weight for an institution. \"The Vatican belongs to the new pope, and needs the pope's permission to live there,\" says one senior fellow at Georgetown University. \"It's better to have him here than somewhere else,where he could become another center of power.\"",

The source confirmed reports that the opiate painkiller Percocet is believed to have been involved.

Fifteen months later, the little girl is still with social service workers, who won't return her to her mother.

Former President Vicente Fox tweeted Thursday: \"I've said this to @realDonaldTrump and now I'll tell you: Mexico is not going to pay for that f---ing wall. #F---ingWall Let's raise our voices against this dictator, Donald Trump.\" Mexican President Enrique Pea Nieto\u2014whose personal popularity rating is at just 12%, the lowest in history\u2014had been scheduled to meet with Trump officials on Thursday, the same day Mexico's foreign minister and economy minister met with the Trump administration. The Wall Street Journal reports that if Mexico does not pay for the wall, it could be forced to abandon the North American Free Trade Agreement, which it has been trying to salvage for years. \"If we're going for something that is less than what we have now, it doesn't make sense to stay in,\" economy minister Ildefonso Guajardo said earlier this week. \"There is unity; people do not like Trump.\" The two leaders plan to meet in Mexico City later this month.",

After Trump signed an executive order Wednesday and promised to start building the wall within months, Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto told his country in a televised address that Mexico \"does not believe in walls\" and will not pay for it, no matter what Trump says, the BBC reports. \"I regret and condemn the decision of the United States to continue construction of a wall that, for years, has divided us instead of uniting us,\" he said. In other coverage: Pe\u00f1a Nieto said Mexico still offers its friendship to the US, but he didn't confirm whether he plans to go ahead with his Jan. 31 meeting with Trump at the White House, the Guardian reports. Senior government officials said late Wednesday that the Mexican leader is thinking about calling it off. CNN reports that Pe\u00f1a Nieto said he would wait for an evaluation from Mexican officials in the US before confirming the visit to the US. He also said he had ordered government agencies, including the 50 Mexican consulates in the US, to step up protection for immigrants. The Washington Post looks at five major challenges the wall project will face, including rough terrain and the fact that most land along the border in Texas is privately owned. In Mexico, people are furious and are calling for a stern response to Trump's plans, reports the New York Times. \"It's like we are Charlie Brown and they are Lucy with the football,\" says former foreign minister Jorge Castaneda. \"Pe\u00f1a is a weak president in a weak country at a weak moment, but he has to find a way to get some official backbone.\" Historians say the last president to anger Mexico this much was Calvin Coolidge, who threatened to invade \"Soviet Mexico\" in the 1920s.

If the seizures go ahead, it would be a first for the government, which has followed a \"willing seller, willing buyer\" process since 1994 to white farmers who were willing to sell their land to blacks.

The organization's recommendation: Tamp down the size and scale of said exercises, start hammering out a new treaty on limiting the types of weapons used along the borders, and publicly announce beforehand when exercises are being held (Russia is pointed out as a prime offender in this regard).

The study found that 1.7% of women knew or suspected their best friend had self-induced an abortion, and 4.1% of women said they'd tried to do so themselves, the Dallas Morning News reports. \"Nobody should be denied safe and compassionate care based on her zip code,\" the president and CEO of Whole Woman's Health, an independent abortion provider in Texas, says. \"But that's exactly what.\" The study, published in the journal Pediatrics, looked at 1,171 women who had abortions in Texas between 2009 and 2013 (the most recent year for which data is available), and found that about half of them ended up having an abortion after taking the drug misoprostol, which is commonly used to induce miscarriages, the Houston Chronicle reports.

Findings of the Texas Policy Evaluation Project are startling: Between 100,000 and 240,000 Texan women ages 18 to 49 have taken matters into their own hands and tried to induce an abortion at home, with, as the Guardian puts it, \"varying degrees of success and differing medical consequences.\" The report asked an online sample of 779 women if they or their best friends had ever tried to self-induce an abortion, with 1.7% saying they had and 4.1% saying their best friend had or they suspected she had, the Atlantic reports. Extrapolating those figures to the nearly 6 million women of reproductive age in Texas is how researchers came to the final numbers, Mother Jones notes. In terms of methods used to attempt an abortion, the drug misoprostol was the most commonly cited, with others including \"herbs or homeopathic remedies,\" alcohol, illegal drugs, hormonal pills, and \"getting hit or punched in the abdomen,\" per the Atlantic. Texas restrictions on abortions are among the strictest in the US: The 2013 HB2 law has shut more than half the state's 41 abortion clinics. The CEO of a gynecology and abortion care organization tells the Guardian that the result is \"tremendously disrespectful.

Now researchers report in the journal Nature Communications that their 18-month study is the \"strongest evidence to date for a role for visual signals in the key evolutionary processes by which species are formed and maintained, and it is particularly exciting that we have found it in part of our own lineage.\" Researchers used facial recognition technology developed for humans to identify primate features from photos taken at zoos in the US, UK, and Nigeria, reports the BBC. \"Our findings offer evidence for the use of visual signals to help ensure species recognition: species may evolve to look distinct specifically from the other species they are at risk of interbreeding with,\" says senior author James Higham. \"In other words, how you end up looking is a function of how those around you look.\" Guenon monkeys live in Central and West Africa's forests, where they eat fruits, insects, and leaves and often live in large groups of two or more species. They're also prone to interbreeding, since they spend so much time with other friendly monkeys, their offspring might be infertile or less healthy. \"These results strongly suggest that the extraordinary appearance of these monkeys has been due to selection for visual signaling that discourage hybridization,\" says the lead author.

According to the San Gabriel Valley Tribune, Morrad Ghonim was 17 when his wife, Victoria, was shot in the head while the couple's 6-month-old son was in the back seat of their car in a La Mirada park. She died the next day. Prosecutors say Ghonim wanted his wife killed so he could collect $1 million in life insurance. Leon Martinez, the hit man who was convicted of the murder last year, testified this week that Ghonim asked him if he knew anyone who would kill for money. Martinez says Ghonim gave him $10,000 to kill Victoria and that he remembers walking up to the car and shooting her as she begged him not to hurt her baby. He claims Ghonim then handed him an envelope of cash. Martinez was sentenced to 28 years to life in prison without parole for the murder. Ghonim, who was living in Antigua at the time of his wife's murder and remarried a woman from Jordan, was arrested in 2015 and charged with murder for financial gain and lying in wait. His lawyer argued that Martinez is lying about the killing because he and Ghonim had a second marriage and he wants to see Ghonim go to prison. \u201cSo essentially this is a 20-year-olds murder that comes down to the credibility of a convicted killer and an ex-wife,\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t hear evidence of a real motive.\u201d Ghonim remarried a new wife is currently living in Jordan.",

But as they made to drive off, a gunman approached the passenger door, demanded money, and murdered his wife. Now, 24 years later, a jury has decided who was responsible for Vicki Ghonim's death: then-19-year-old Morrad Ghonim. The 43-year-old, who was extradited from Antigua last year, was on Monday found guilty of first-degree murder. The man who pulled the trigger, however, was Leon Martinez. Police got to Martinez by way of grant money earmarked for cold cases, reports the Whittier Daily News. A DNA test of pants found near the scene led them in 2010 to Martinez, who said Ghonim hired him and even reached over his wife's body to hand him payment. A friend of Martinez's relayed meeting a man days before Vicki's death who said he and his child's mother\u2014a student at John Glenn High, as Vicki was\u2014were having issues and planned to separate.

I would be fine with the changes if 'Share Everything' was just one of many options, but it's not. For a couple, the new share plan would cost $150 for access to two smartphones, 4GB of data, and unlimited text and voice.\" Existing customers can keep their unlimited plans, but they'll have to give up unlimited data if they upgrade to a new subsidized phone. The access fee for devices is $40 a month, while a basic phone is $30, laptops, Netbooks, and mobile hotspots are $20. Even the lowest rate\u2014 $10 a month for a tablet\u2014seems excessively high. Sprint, meanwhile, is already offering unlimited data on iPads for $80 a month. \"Think of your family and ask yourself: What is easier?

The problem? Data may be cheaper under the new plans, but \"you pay more per device,\" he explains. \"Verizon's new plan does not give families a discount. The difference amounts to an administrative change.\" Troy Wolverton goes a bit further in the Mercury News, calling the new plans \"a crummy deal for many consumers.\" He finds that many users will actually end up paying more, since the only real price breaks are on talk minutes and text messages\u2014\"services [consumers] are already using less.\" \"Overall, the move appears to be a price hike tarted up to look consumer friendly,\" he writes. All the critics concede that the new plans are certainly simpler to understand, but on ZDNet, Matthew Miller is \"disappointed that convenience comes at such a high price.\" If Sprint gets its LTE network running, it will be an \"attractive\" option for individual unlimited plans at $80 per phone, he notes. On CNET, Roger Cheng points out that Verizon is now \"forcing\" unlimited voice and text messages with these plans. \"Under the change, customers will have to give up their old grandfathered unlimited data plans right as people use more data than ever,\" he writes. \"It's a classic case of a carrier giving you more of what you don't need, and taking away what you do\u2014all for a higher price.\" The new plans roll out on June 28, and the only way to keep your existing plan is to upgrade to new phones at full cost, with no discount.",

In another tweet, he said Trudeau \"is being so indignant, bringing up the relationship that the U.S. and Canada had over the many years and all sorts of other things...but he doesn\u2019t bring up the fact that they charge us up to 300% on dairy \u2014 hurting our Farmers, killing our Agriculture!\" A third tweet warned the EU and Canada to \"Take down your tariffs & barriers or we will more than match you!\" Earlier Thursday, Macron said that the other six countries may end up signing an agreement that doesn't include the US. (Trump reportedly brought up a War of 1812 incident when discussing new tariffs on Canadian steel.)",

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 The captain of a Missouri duck boat that sank July 19 on Table Rock Lake, killing 17 people, was \"misconduct, negligence, or inattention to the duties\" that resulted in the deaths, according to a federal complaint filed Wednesday. The complaint was the first step in a federal criminal investigation into the sinking of the duck boat operated by Ripley Entertainment, which is being sued in four civil cases by survivors and families of the victims, the Kansas City Star reports. In its motion to allow federal investigators to talk to the relevant witnesses and participants in the cases, the US government said the victims and their families \"have a right to be heard.\" The federal investigation also looks at another duck boat captain and officials at the company that operates the tourist ride, CNN reports. Kenneth Scott McKee and Barry King, both of whom survived the sinking, \"are aware of their status as targets of the Government action,\" according to documents filed Wednesday in US District Court. They are under investigation for allegedly operating the vessel in a manner that endangered lives. The filing asked the court to put a hold on all lawsuits until the criminal investigation is complete.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The duck boat sinking that killed 17 on a Missouri lake is now the subject of a federal criminal investigation after the Coast Guard found probable cause for negligence. The US Attorney's Office for the Western District of Missouri is seeking to delay civil lawsuits over the July 19 incident until the end of its \"wide-ranging\" investigation to prevent revealing evidence too early, though two boat captains already know themselves to be targets. Per the Springfield News-Leader, the Coast Guard found probable cause for \"misconduct, negligence, or inattention to the duties of the captain\" by Kenneth McKee of Ride the Ducks Branson's sunken Stretch Duck 07, and also probable cause that Barry King acted in a \"grossly negligent manner\" while operating Stretch Duck 54, which made it to safety. The Branson area had been under a severe thunderstorm warning for 20 minutes before Stretch Duck 07 entered Table Rock Lake, where 73mph winds whipped up waves more than three feet high. Per the Wichita Eagle, the boat wasn't to be operated in winds exceeding 35mph or waves exceeding two feet. Civil cases also accuse Ride the Ducks Branson, owned by Ripley Entertainment, of putting passengers at risk through use of boat canopies, citing a National Transportation Safety Board recommendation to remove them following a 1999 tragedy. The NTSB is also investigating this case, along with the state, per CNN. \"We continue to fully cooperate,\" Ripley says in a statement, adding \"we are providing all documentation and materials requested in the case.\"",
