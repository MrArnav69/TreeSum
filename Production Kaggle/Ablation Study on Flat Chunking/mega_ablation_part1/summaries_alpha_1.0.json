    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Scientists say they've made a \"landmark\" breakthrough in the fight against Alzheimer's disease with an experimental drug that appears to slow the disease's progress in mice, the Guardian reports. Researchers at Lancaster University in the UK say the drug, called erenumab, slowed the progression of the disease in mice by blocking a protein that clogs the brain with abnormal proteins. \"This finding, I suspect, will be judged by history as a turning point in the search for medicines to control and prevent Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\" a professor of neuroscience tells the Telegraph. \"If this process is also working overtime in these conditions, targeting it could be a promising avenue for investigation.\" The drug, which is still in the early stages of development, targeted the harmful way brain cells react to misfolded proteins. Using a drug injected into the stomachs of mice through a mouth tube, they flipped a cellular switch from \"off\" to \"on\" to prevent neurons dying. Five weeks after treatment one group of mice remained free of symptoms such as memory loss, impaired reflexes, and limb dragging. They also lived longer than untreated animals with the same brain disease. The study focused on the root cause of many brain diseases\u2014 abnormally shaped proteins that stick together in clumps and fibers. When enough misshapen protein builds up in the brain, it can trigger a reaction that results in the death of nerve cells. Other approaches have sought to stop or limit the accumulation of the abnormal protein, whose structure is folded the wrong way. \"However, what is true in animals does not always hold true in people, and the ultimate test for this compound will be a true test,\" the lead researcher tells the Independent.",

Neurodegenerative diseases halt the production of key proteins, which in turn results in the unprotected brain cells dying off, and symptoms appearing. The compound blocks the faulty brain signal that causes the initial \"shutdown,\" thus basically flipping the switch from \"off\" back to \"on.\" Proteins are produced, brain cells are protected, and symptoms are reversed. The mice in the study had prion disease, which is similar to a human neurodegenerative disorder. After receiving the compound, memory loss and other symptoms including impaired reflexes and limb dragging were reversed; the treated mice also lived longer than those who didn't receive the compound, Sky News reports. Though it's still a long way off, scientists think a treatment based on these findings could also help people with Parkinson's disease.

The diocese was first made aware of the alleged sexual abuse in February. The priest was suspended from ministry and removed from the church in June 2017 after admitting to the financial misconduct. Burns says the diocese wasn't informed of the sexual assault allegation until February because officials wanted to protect the victims' identities while the investigation was underway.

The Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests accuses the diocese of waiting too long. \"Why would Bishop Burns suppress this crucial information?\" the group says in a statement. \"What about concern for the safety of children and the need to comfort any survivors?\" The name of one of the men in the report is clearly redacted, but it appears to be that of the late Father Lawrence Parede, a priest in the Archdiocese of Dallas who was accused of abusing at least seven children over a period of 20 years starting in the 1990s. Burns said he was \"saddened\" and read at Sunday's Mass.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The Catholic Church has hired two private investigators to track down a former Dallas priest who disappeared months before sexual abuse allegations against him surfaced. Pastor at St. Cecilia Catholic Church in Oak Cliff for 27 years, Rev. Edmundo Paredes stands accused of molesting three boys in their midteens between 10 and 20 years ago, though the exact period is being withheld to protect the victims\u2019 identities, reports the Dallas Morning News. Paredes, 69, was removed from St. Cecilia in June 2017 after allegedly stealing $60,000 to $80,000 in cash. This February, church officials also learned of sexual abuse allegations, which were reported to police and found to be credible, Bishop Edward Burns told parishioners on Sunday. \"I recognize this diocese cannot cover its ears, its eyes, its mouth. We need to look at this head on,\" Burns said. Still, the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests questions the delay in releasing the information. Officials initially said the allegations weren\u2019t disclosed earlier because of a police investigation. Late Monday, however, the Diocese of Dallas said a Pennsylvania grand jury report describing more than 1,000 victims of abuse by clergy since the 1940s had motivated the disclosure after victims objected to an announcement in March, per Fox 4. Officials suspect Paredes is in his native Philippines, which he visited annually, per WFAA. Per the Morning News, authorities there say they are unaware of his location."

Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, both of whom support abortion rights and will likely have a big say in who comes next. A remedy: At Vox, Ezra Klein writes that both parties are guilty of turning the nomination process into an \"insane\" one, given the stakes. At this point, if one party held the White House and the other the Senate, it's unlikely any nominee would be confirmed. His solution? Reduce the stakes by limiting justices to 10-year terms. A big percentage: The Washington Post picks out five times Kennedy cast the deciding vote on big issues, on everything from backing abortion rights to supporting gay rights to curtailing the death penalty.

But CGI is a \"roll-up\" company formed by acquiring other companies\u2014one of which, American Management Systems, was one giant black mark. AMS projects have hit trouble in at least 12 states as well as at the federal level, including a much-publicized 2001 failure to automate federal retirement benefits. The company went $60 million over budget on that one, yet produced nothing useful. More than 100 AMS alumni are now CGI executives or consultants. \"Should CMS have recognized that \u2018OK, here\u2019s CGI Federal. It\u2019s a new company, but, oh, my God, it looks a lot like the AMS from yesterday\u2019?\" asked one ex-CMS official. \"Yes. I would consider that dropping the ball.\" But it didn't come up in 2007, and CMS never re-vetted the company, the Post's review of internal documents reveals. On the bright side, the review also reveals that the decision was politics-free, made purely because officials considered CMS' bid \"technically superior.\" Vanity Fair, meanwhile, has an in-depth piece today on what many suspect is an accounting scandal brewing at CGI. It looks a lot like the company is using its acquisitions to mask financial problems, a quasi-legal practice known as creating a \"cookie jar.\""

Finally, lawyers at the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University's law school exposed a glaring hole (and possibly corruption) in the arson investigators' case. That evidence got Bunch released in 2012 after 16 years in prison, USA Today reported at the time. Then two lawyers from the Center, Karen Daniel and Judy Royal, began helping wrongfully convicted women based on a shocking statistic: Women constitute roughly 11% of violent-crime convictions but only 6% of overturned cases. But why are women's cases harder to overturn? Daniel and Royal give their reasons: Women are usually convicted of violent crimes against people close to them (like a husband or son) so DNA evidence won't help; the suspect's DNA is already spread around the crime scene. By contrast, men usually assault or kill strangers. An incredible 63% of women's exoneration cases turn out to be accidents or suicides rather than crimes. So instead of finding a \"real culprit,\" Daniel and Royal may have to laboriously dismantle the prosecutors' case, perhaps with new science on arson or shaken-baby syndrome that not everyone accepts. Sexist stereotypes are used against women in court.

But at the BBC, a review of existing research on the topic suggests the drinks' variety itself isn't the problem. Instead, Claudia Hammond points to other possible factors. For instance, she notes, having several different types of drinks may simply mean drinking more total alcohol. (As for \"beer before liquor, never been sicker\"? It appears no research has been done to prove or disprove the idea that drink order makes a difference.) \"The existing evidence suggests that hangovers can't be blamed on mixing drinks,\" Hammond writes. But the amount of alcohol may not be the only culprit: Congeners, the non-ethanol products of the fermentation process, also contribute to a hangover. Tannins, for instance, are responsible for the color in darker types of alcohol. There are 37 times more congeners in bourbon than in vodka, and one study found that bourbon drinkers reported worse hangovers than those who drank vodka. So, Hammond writes, people having various types of drinks in a single night may end up indulging in drinks with more tannins. So go ahead and mix types of alcohol if you so desire, but you may want to avoid mixing alcohol with cigarettes: A study last month found that people who smoke and drink are at a higher risk of developing esophageal cancer, Science Daily reported.

Throughout November, the researchers will conduct flights over the park using the electromagnetic system, which acts like an X-ray to determine where and how hot water flows beneath the surface. The team also hopes to gain insights into the infrequent but sometimes massive hydrothermal explosions that occur in the park, says lead scientist Carol Finn with the US Geological Survey. One such explosion, or possibly multiple explosions, that occurred roughly 13,800 years ago left a crater that measures 1-1/2 miles across beneath at the bottom of Yellowstone Lake. It's believed to be the largest such crater in the world. Similar to the regular eruptions of Old Faithful, hydrothermal explosions occur when huge pockets of boiling water beneath the ground experience a sudden drop in pressure, causing the water to convert to steam and explode violently to the surface, per the Billings Gazette. \"Nobody knows anything about the flow paths\" for the hot water that erupts from Yellowstone's geysers. \"Does it travel down and back up? Does it travel laterally\u2014This is really kind of a last frontier if you will, in Yellowstone, of being able to look at a large part that\u2019s underground that people have not looked at.\"",

She's waited a decade to explore what she calls \"a last frontier ... in Yellowstone,\" and the intention is to better map the flow of water that's feeding Old Faithful and rare but sometimes violent hydrothermal explosions. Over a four-week period, a helicopter will fly above, armed with electromagnetic technology that looks like a giant hula hoop. The AP explains it in layman's terms: \"The device acts like an X-ray to determine where and how hot water flows beneath the surface.\" Scientists will use the data to determine whether solid earth, \"rotten\" sulfuric rock, or water lurks below, which could assist in identifying unstable areas, per Wyoming Public Media. But a press release frames the main quest like so: We know that the water that explodes from Yellowstone's geysers \"originates as old precipitation, snow and rain that percolates down into the crust, is heated, and ultimately returns to the surface.\" We know that it can take as long as thousands of years for that process to run its course. What scientists are hoping to determine are the routes these waters take. \"Does it travel down and back up? Does it travel laterally?\" asks Finn. Right now, \"nobody knows.\" (Archaeologists made a surprise find underneath a Mayan temple.)"

The findings, published in the Journal of Pediatrics, are based on a meta-analysis of studies involving 8,700 infants in countries including Germany, Denmark, Japan, and Canada. They found that babies cry for an average of two hours per day in the first two weeks of life, peaks at two hours 15 minutes at six weeks, and reduces to one hour 10 minutes by the 12th week. But some babies cry as little as 30 minutes per day, and others as much as five hours. The highest levels of colic\u2014crying more than three hours a day for at least three days a week\u2014were found in the UK, followed by Canada (34.1% at 3-4 weeks of age), and Italy (20.9% at 8-9 weeks). Denmark, Germany, and Japan, on the other hand, had the lowest rates of colic. \"Babies are already very different in how much they cry,\" says researcher Dieter Wolke. \"We may learn more from looking at cultures where there is less crying and whether this may be due to parenting or other factors relating to pregnancy experiences.\" Previous research has found that 40% of crying in babies is inconsolable, and Wolke blames \"unscientific\" parenting books for undue stress.",

British babies came in second, followed by Italy. The most tranquil tots, meanwhile, live in Denmark and Germany. Writing in the Journal of Pediatrics, psychologists at the University of Warwick analyzed 28 previous studies of some 8,700 infants to measure colic\u2014a harmless, if nerve-jangling, condition\u2014by gauging crying times during the first 12 weeks. The longest crying jags were clocked in Canada, reports the Guardian, where 34.1% of babies wailed more than three hours a day, at least three days a week. In the UK, the tally was 28% and in Italy 20.9%. Relatively blissful Danish babes scored 5.5%, with Germany at 6.7%. The first-of-its kind analysis found that babies the world over cry around two hours a day for the first weeks, peaking at two hours and 15 minutes at six weeks. Happily for stressed-out new parents everywhere, crying time is halved by week 12, per a press release. Lead researcher Dieter Wolke says parents in countries with low colic scores are less likely to intervene when baby starts crying, allowing the infant to self-soothe. \"They don\u2019t get all worried about it,\" Wolke tells the Telegraph. Then again, he notes, Danish babies may enjoy a bit of \"genetic bias\" since their country consistently ranks at the top of wellness surveys. In any case, new parents should learn to chill. \"If you are not relaxed you are not going to be any use to your baby,\" Wolke says. (Crying saved this baby's life.)"

Robin Thicke and brother Brennan, the oldest of Thicke's three sons, say that Tanya Callau\u2014who wed Thicke in 2005\u2014is threatening them with bad publicity unless they give her more of Thicke's estate. Thicke left much of his estate to his three children, but Callau still inherited a significant amount (the Hollywood Reporter has the exact breakdown) and was allowed to continue living on his Carpinteria, Calif., ranch. Thicke's sons say their father acquired most of his wealth before meeting Callau, and that she signed a prenup prior to marrying Thicke. They also say she had no issues with the prenup or the estate plan the last time Thicke updated his trust, in February 2016. (He died in December.) But now, Thicke's sons claim, Callau is claiming the prenup is invalid and there are problems with the trust. Per a petition the brothers filed in a Los Angeles court this week, the brothers say Callau also claims she has community rights to more of Thicke's assets, she should be reimbursed for any improvements she makes to the ranch while living there, and that she took a step back from her own career to support Thicke and help raise his youngest son. The brothers' attorney says in the filing that Callau has \"threatened to make her claims fodder for 'tabloid publicity' unless the Co-Trustees agreed to participate in a mediation and succumb to her demands,\" leading the brothers to ask a court to enforce the prenup and Thicke's will, TMZ reports. Callau's rep says in a statement, \"Tanya Thicke has never threatened to take private family matters public.\""

Census data shows that 90% of people with the last name Washington are black. The story of how the name came to be begins with slavery, and takes a sharp turn after the Civil War, when all blacks were allowed to have their own surname. By choosing the name, Washington says, Reconstruction-era blacks might have been showing pride in the nation's. The US Census Bureau released a list of the 1,000 most common surnames in the country in 2000, and Washington was listed as 138th because most of those names were given to black people. But when the same list was released in 2010, Washington was at No. 1, with only 5% of its 146,520 names being black. \"It's an assumption that the surname is tied to George,\" says an expert on black genealogy. \"There is no direct evidence.\" Coincidence or not, today the numbers are equally stark.",

It could be that blacks chose the name to honor George himself, an odd prospect when you consider that the first US president, while opposed to slavery on paper, owned 124 slaves and worked them hard. But perhaps not so odd when you realize that Washington also freed all 124 of those slaves upon his and his wife\u2019s deaths; of the eight American presidents who owned slaves while in office, he was the only one to do so. Some of his former slaves may have chosen to take his surname as a mark of their community; others may have wanted to maintain a link to a powerful family after being freed. Or the choice could have been random: Booker T. Washington, for example, has never said why he chose his last name 60 years or so after George Washington\u2019s death. Some may even have picked the name to signal their devotion to their new country: \"There was a lot more consciousness and pride in American history among African-Americans and enslaved African-Americans than a lot of people give them credit for,\u201d says one professor and author.

Both males and females have those long ... hairs, like whiskers. They're not like human pubic hairs.\" Among its other features: Rowe explains that the 18-inch-long rat's mouth opening is so narrow that it can't open it much. \"It probably eats worms and insect larvae, just kind of slurping them up.\" (In line with that slurping, it also lacks the coronoid process on the dentary bone, which other mammals rely on to chew.)

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 \"That's the eye of a burglar.\" That's what convicted jewel thief Matthew Durham says he told himself after stealing two Vincent van Gogh paintings from New York's Guggenheim Museum in 2002, the New York Times reports. In a new documentary, Durham\u2014who was sentenced to life in prison in 2005 for the brazen theft\u2014says he did it because he could. \"I could hear them on my police scanner. They didn't know it was me.\" The works, \"View of the Sea at Scheveningen\" (1882) and \"Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen\" (1882-84), were never sold and are believed to be worth in the neighborhood of $10 million to $70 million each. In addition to bragging about the \"spectacular jobs\" he's done, Durham, 47, reveals for the first time how he got away with the paintings. He and an accomplice tied up the gallery's wall with rope, stuffed the paintings into a bag, and escaped in a getaway car. A security guard called the police, but she was not permitted to use force to try to stop the burglars. Durham left behind a black baseball cap. Police say the men used ropes to make their getaway from the Stedelijk Museum, where they stole two paintings by masters including Vincent Van Gogh and realist painter Paul Cezanne. One of the paintings taken was a seascape by Dutch master Willem de Kooning. The other was a painting by 19th-century Dutch painter Jaap Meijer.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 \"I'm a born burglar,\" says Octave Durham, per the New York Times, which looks at a new documentary about Durham's notorious theft of two Vincent Van Gogh paintings. Set to be broadcast Tuesday on Dutch TV, the 45-minute special by filmmaker Vincent Verweij gets the inside scoop on the 2002 heist Durham says took less than four minutes and nabbed him two works the Times deems \"of inestimable value\": Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen and View of the Sea at Scheveningen. Durham, who was convicted for the burglary in 2004 and spent just over two years in prison, says he passed cops in his getaway car and brags that he'd pulled off \"more spectacular jobs than this\"\u2014after years of denying he had any involvement in the theft, per Versopolis.com. In one reveal that may insult art lovers everywhere, Durham notes he didn't run off with the Van Goghs because of any particular love for the great master, or for art in general: He did it because it was an opportunity for a big get. \"That's the eye of a burglar,\" he says. Per NLTimes.com, Durham told a Dutch paper over the weekend he'd wanted to steal two other Van Gogh paintings\u2014Sunflowers and The Potato Eaters\u2014but one was too big to slip out and the other was under heavy security, so he and partner Henk Bieslijn settled on the other two. The Times notes the Van Gogh Museum is still \"furious\" with Durham, who didn't get paid for the film, and refused to help Verweij. The filmmaker defends his choice of cinematic subject, noting, \"You never see documentaries or articles about art theft from the perspective of the thief.\" (The Van Gogh Museum was pretty stoked when the paintings were recovered.)"

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 The floods that devastated northern California earlier this month have left a trail of debris at the nation's tallest dam, and amateur gold miners are eager to find out what it is. The San Francisco Chronicle reports the Feather River's spillway at Lake Oroville is partially collapsed, leaving a path of debris in its wake. The California Department of Water Resources says it doesn't know if gold has been found in the area, and a rep for the DWR tells the Chico Enterprise-Record that \"if anybody gets close to it they will be run off.\" One prospector says he believes there is a gold vein that runs from the spillway down to Potter's Ravine. He says he'll use a metal detector to look for quartz that has been worn down by the water, which will give him a strong signal. \"I don't do it for the money,\" says Bob Van Camp, who's known locally as \"Digger Bob\" and was the rep in 2014 when a 5.18-pound gold nugget was found in Butte foothills. \"[It's] something that an old-time gold miner missed,\" he says. He would love to get his hands on.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 This winter's flooding in Northern California has done more than bring relief after years of drought; it's created the prospect of the best gold prospecting in 20 years. Gold hunters in the area tell the Chico Enterprise-Record the floods have \"rearranged the rivers\" and \"move things around.\" That means gold veins that have been hidden for 200 years are suddenly exposed. According to CBS San Francisco, the floods also swept gold out of abandoned mines and washed it downriver. While KCRA reports that gold can simply be picked off the ground following major flooding, the best prospecting will come in the summer months when the water has receded. Right now, rivers are still high and government workers are trying to keep would-be prospectors away while they get things under control. But in the summer\u2014which experts say could be the busiest since the one that followed major flooding in 1997\u2014stream beds will be exposed for better gold hunting. \"I'm going to have a ball,\" one prospector tells the Chico newspaper. The epicenter for the new gold rush could be the Oroville Dam, which nearly catastrophically flooded this winter and required the use of an emergency spillway for the first time.

The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\"). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home.

Kimball said Smith told her that \"the practice of this principle would be the hardest trial the Saints would ever have to test their faith.\" Two more essays discuss plural marriage in the church's later years; they're part of an effort the church is making to share \"reliable, faith-promoting\" info about its past, the church's historian tells the Times.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 \"I believe you!!!\" Mira Sorvino writes in an open letter to Dylan Farrow published by the HuffPost. The actor reached out to Woody Allen's daughter Wednesday to apologize for starring in her father's Mighty Aphrodite\u2014for which she won an Oscar\u2014while ignoring Farrow's claims of sexual abuse against Allen. Farrow was 7 when she said Allen sexually touched her, and a judge later found her claims credible, though Allen has continually denied the allegations, Vulture reports. Sorvino says she was aware of Farrow's claims when she made Mighty Aphrodite but dismissed them \"as an outgrowth of a twisted custody battle\" because of her lifelong love of Allen's work. \"It is difficult to sever ties and denounce your heroes, your benefactors, whom you fondly admired and felt a debt of gratitude toward for your entire career\u2019s existence,\" she writes. Sorvino says her experience opening up to Farrow's brother, reporter Ronan Farrow, about Harvey Weinstein made her want to learn more about Dylan Farrow's allegations, which led to her taking those allegations seriously. Sorvino says her love of Allen's work \"does not excuse my turning a blind eye to your story simply because I wanted desperately for it not to be so.\" She says she won't work with Allen again, writing: \"We are in a day and age when everything must be re-examined. This kind of abuse cannot be allowed to continue. If this means tearing down all the old gods, so be it.\" Sorvino isn't the first actor to denounce Allen. Greta Gerwig and David Krumholtz recently said they regret working with him. And Vanity Fair reports Ellen Page in November called doing an Allen movie \"the biggest regret of my career.\""

The decision was a setback for Nestle\u2014which manages the brand overseas; Hershey is licensed to sell the brand here in the US\u2014and a victory for Cadbury, which was trying to block the trademark. The ruling means that, for now, other candy companies can make similar-looking chocolate bars.

The BBC even notes that in Norway, a lesser-known chocolate bar called Kvikk Lunsj (\"quick lunch\") has been around for nearly as long as KitKat. The fight between the two confectionary giants is the second major brouhaha they've had in recent years: In 2013, Nestle managed to block Cadbury's attempts to trademark its signature purple-colored chocolate wrappers, per Bloomberg.

The problem is that red meat contains a protein linked to a sugar molecule called galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose, or alpha-gal, which can cause a life-threatening reaction in people. For years, physicians and researchers only reported the allergy in places the lone star ticks call home, namely the southeastern US. But recently it's started to spread. Duluth, Minnesota, Hanover, New Hampshire, and the eastern tip of Long Island, where at least 100 cases have been reported in the last year. Scientists are racing to trace its spread, to understand if the lone Star tick is expanding into new territories, or if other species of ticks are now causing the allergy. The best guess is that something in the tick's saliva hijacks humans' immune systems and triggers the massive release of histamines whenever red meat is consumed. \"Just a few bites and you can render anyone really, really allergic,\" says an asthma and allergy fellow at the University of North Carolina, who's working on a cure. Wired has more.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Ticks are out in force this year, and there's one species in particular you should watch out for if you'd ever like to eat meat again. Experts say the lone star tick appears to be spreading from its home base in the southeastern US. Whereas other ticks can spread ailments such as Lyme disease, the lone star tick is bothersome because it is believed to trigger a potentially life-threatening and apparently lifelong meat allergy with its bite. The tick doesn't technically make people allergic to meat, but rather to a sugar molecule found in red meat known as alpha-gal. This alpha-gal allergy has typically been limited to the southeastern US, where the lone star tick is prevalent, but no more, reports Wired. Cases\u2014in which the consumption of meat can result in hives, difficulty breathing, or death\u2014have been reported in Minnesota, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and New York, per Inverse. Long Island has seen at least 100 cases in the last year. Researchers suspect the spread of the allergy coincides with the spread of lone star ticks, though it's also possible that other ticks are responsible. Either way, \"the nuisance level [for lone star ticks] is much higher than the black-legged tick,\" an expert tells the Weston Forum. \"It is aggressive and very abundant.\" Researchers are currently studying the effect of a lone star tick bite on mice to determine why it triggers the allergy.

The effect endures, too, since people tend to respond to messages using the same medium, thus the recipient may in turn experience similarly heightened emotions when replying, reports Pacific Standard. \"When writing romantic emails, senders consciously or subconsciously added more positive content to their messages, perhaps to compensate for the medium's inability to convey vocal tone,\" Dennis and Wells wrote in the paper. \"Senders engage with email messages longer and may think about the task more deeply than when leaving voicemails.

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 More than 24 hours after AirAsia lost contact with Flight 8501, there's still no sign of the crashed jet, which was carrying 162 people from Surabaya, Indonesia, to Singapore. Here's what we know so far and what we don't know: The plane was in the safest part of flight: Just 10% of fatal crashes from 2004 through 2013 occurred while a plane was at cruise elevation, according to a safety study published by Boeing in August. Airbus jets have sophisticated computers that automatically adjust to wind shears or other weather disruptions. But weather\u2014combined with pilot errors\u2014has played a role in past air disasters that occurred at cruise altitude, including the 2009 Air France Flight 447 crash over the Atlantic Ocean. Another possibility is some type of catastrophic metal fatigue caused by the cycle of pressurization and depressurization associated with each takeoff and landing cycle. This A320 had had 13,600 takeoffs and landings. Many occurred in humid climate, which speeds corrosion. The last communication between the pilot and air traffic control was 6:12am Sunday when the pilot \"asked to avoid clouds by turning left and going higher to 38,000 feet.\" The last radar contact occurred: Indonesia has sent out two Cessna jets to join the search for AirAsia Flight 8501. More than 1,100 search-and-rescue personnel from six countries are on their way to the area. The Airbus A320 was carrying 155 passengers, including 18 children, and seven crew members.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The disappearance of another jet in Southeast Asia while the fate of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 remains a mystery comes as a shock to the aviation world, but experts stress that the two cases are very different. The New York Times runs through some of the differences with AirAsia Flight 8501: Unlike with Flight 370, there has been no sign that anybody on Flight 8501 intentionally disabled any onboard systems, meaning that investigators should have the normal automatic transmissions from the flight to help the search. Flight 370 disappeared on a clear night, while Flight 8501 was believed to have encountered stormy weather, with weather agencies having reported lightning strikes along its route. The AirAsia pilot's last communication with air traffic control was a request \"to avoid clouds by turning left and going higher to 38,000 feet.\" Flight 370's pilot was very experienced, with more than 18,000 hours of flying time, while the combined experience of Flight 8501's pilot and co-pilot is believed to be less than half that. Neither Flight 370 nor Flight 8501 issued an emergency distress call, but, as the AP notes, \"pilots are trained to focus first on the emergency at hand and then communicate only when free,\" and there's no sign that the AirAsia flight diverted sharply from its intended course the way the Malaysia Airlines flight did. Another major difference is the search area for Flight 8501, which is much smaller and shallower than the vast area that has been searched for Flight 370. \"We are not talking about the deep Indian Ocean here,\" says CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest. \"We are talking about congested airspace around Southeast Asia. There will be much better radar coverage. There's certainly better air traffic control coverage.\""

In Donetsk, separatists have dubbed the region an independent republic, and have called for the sovereignty referendum to be held by May 11, the AP reports, noting that Crimea did much the same before Russia annexed it. These self-proclaimed lawmakers have also asked Vladimir Putin to send peacekeeping troops, according to Russia's state-run ITAR-Tass news agency. Acting Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov has canceled a trip abroad to deal with the unrest, and the country's interior minister, who blames the protests on Vladimir Putin and ousted Ukrainian leader Viktor Yanukovich, says the turmoil will be dealt with non-violently. He added that \"separatists\" had been removed from one building in Kharkiv as of today. More: Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk today emphasized those Russian fears, saying that country's troops were roughly 20 miles from the border and asserting that \"an anti-Ukrainian plan is being put into operation ... under which foreign troops will cross the border and seize the territory of the country.\" Reuters reports that in Luhansk, protesters occupying the state security building have reportedly taken hold of weapons. Meanwhile, the New York Times reports that a Ukrainian military officer in Crimea was last night killed by a Russian soldier who fired an automatic weapon at the unarmed man. The death apparently resulted from a confrontation between a number of Ukrainian and Russian troops, and occurred in a military dorm. Some Ukrainian military personnel remain in Crimea to facilitate the transition, notes the Times."

The documents released by the Carver County, Minn., sheriff's office Thursday include a request to seal the results of a search conducted at Prince's Paisley Park the day he died, Reuters reports. A judge granted the request, which was made on the grounds that \"intense media scrutiny\" could hamper the investigation or risk injury to innocent people. Carver County Chief Deputy Jason Kamerud declined to comment on reports of drugs found at Prince's home. He tells the AP that contrary to media reports, investigators have not asked the DEA to get involved. \"We might contact them to help us, but that hasn't happened,\" he says. \"We don't have the medical examiner's report yet.

Researchers looked at data from 1993 to 2012 and found that the suicide rate for black children rose from 1.36 per million to 2.54 per million, while the rate for white children fell from 1.14 to 0.77, the New York Times reports. Hanging/suffocation was the most common method of death for black boys, with a rate of 1.35 per million compared to 1.14 million for white boys. The study's lead author, Dr. Nancy Kalish, tells the Times that the findings suggest that \"prevention efforts in children younger than 12 years should be more focused on black and Latino communities.\" She says the findings should be a wake-up call for public health officials, especially since black children are still more likely than whites to die from gun violence. Kalish says black children who are bullied or teased may also be at higher risk of suicide. Researchers say the reason for the increased suicide rate in black boys is unclear, but they suspect it may have something to do with the fact that they are less likely to get the medical care and support they need, the Times notes. In the study, researchers also looked at other suicide methods, including hanging, and found they didn't change during the study.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It has to rank among the saddest of studies: a new look at suicides among young children. Researchers reviewed two decades of CDC data, from 1993 to 2012. Though they write in JAMA Pediatrics that \"suicide is a leading cause of death among school-aged children younger than 12 years,\" they found that suicides among those ages 5 to 11 are very rare, reports the AP: There were 657 during the period studied, or one roughly every week-and-a-half (per the CDC, the daily average for all ages is 105 suicides). But while the suicide rate remained stable during that time, \"that stability obscured racial differences,\" observes Psych Central. The suicide rate decreased in white children, but increased significantly in black children, from from 1.36 to 2.54 per 1 million between the study's first five years and its last five. (In white children, the shift was from 1.14 to 0.77.) That shot suicide up from No. 14 on the list of causes of death among black kids of this age to No. 9; it's No. 11 for white kids. The researchers noted that 84% of those who committed suicide were boys and just 16% girls, and the rate worsens when viewed through a gender lens as well. For black boys, the rate climbed to 3.47 per million. The findings represent a big shift, per lead author Jeffrey Bridge. \"Historically, the suicide rate among US black individuals has been lower than that of white individuals across age groups,\" reads the study. \"To our knowledge, this is the first national study to observe higher suicide rates among US black individuals compared with white individuals.\" Hanging and suffocation were the main methods for young children. Bridge advises parents to look for warning signs like prolonged unhappiness and withdrawing from favorite activities. (Related: Why men kill themselves more often than women.)"

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Microwave weapons? That's the latest theory being floated to explain the mysterious ailments suffered by staffers at the American embassy in Cuba. But now a pioneering scientist in that field thinks the idea\u2014based on a principle called the microwave auditory effect\u2014is bogus. Kenneth Foster is a professor of bioengineering at Penn who explained the auditory effect in a 1974 study. At Scientific American, he assesses what's known about the Cuban ailments and lays out why it's \"wildly implausible\" that microwaves are to blame. For one thing, any such weapon powerful enough to cause brain damage would almost certainly burn the victims, too, and that didn't happen. Instead, Foster suggests that a much simpler explanation is likely. \"It is reasonable to guess the sounds were inadvertently produced by ultrasound devices, possibly even spytech, but without malicious intent against the embassy personnel,\" he writes. Foster cites this earlier investigation from the AP revealing the sounds that the victims are believed to have heard, and he says the sounds are consistent with ultrasound devices interacting with each other. It makes sense to him that the Cubans might have been trying to listen in on Americans with these relatively common gizmos. \"The incidents occurred about the time of the 2016 US election, and the Cubans undoubtedly were desperate for intelligence about US intentions.\" A Cuban scientist, meanwhile, agrees that the microwave theory is far-fetched. \"First, it was sonic weapons, now microwave,\" he told CNN. \"What's next, kryptonite?\""

(That's just like 2012.) Most of that is in US Treasury notes, which are worth between $1 million and $5 million. Other assets include Vanguard retirement funds and college saving funds. Current financial disclosure rules only require politicians to list their assets within a broad range, so it's hard to pin down exactly how much Obama has, the New York Times explains. Besides his presidential salary, Obama makes most of his money off royalties from his books, though the market seems to believe he peaked as a writer in the '90s. His latest, 2010's Of Thee I Sing, A Letter to My Daughters, earned between $5,001 and $15,000, compared to $50,001-$100,000 for 1995's Dreams From My Father.

Addiction and hatred are no es bueno for the living.\" It continues, \"We speak for the majority of her family when we say her presence will not ... be missed.\" A viewer contacted WTVC to say it appeared some sections were plagiarized. Several sections are similar to the 2008 obituary for Dolores Aguilar ran in the Vallejo Times Herald in California. Robert Miller blamed the writing on his sisters, although one sister said she didn't write it, and called the obituary tragic and sad. \"Unbelievable. doesn't even have the integrity to write something for herself\u2014just goes out and steals\u2014There will be no service, no prayers, and no closure for the family she spent a lifetime tearing apart,\" reads the obit for Cornelia June Rogers Miller, who died in February at the age of 82.",

The Cherokee Scout publisher says the paper scans all submitted obituaries but notes they won't change anything unless there's a solid reason. \"The family's will overrode the editor,\" he says.

Now, researchers say they've found another that might shed light on how he translated the Book of Mormon. In a paper published in the American Journal of History, the researchers say Smith's translation of the book was based on two seer stones, or spectacles, found in a Shaker village in Ohio in 1831. They believe Smith placed the stones in a hat and \"looked into it.\" The Shaker, Richard McNemar, was a devout Mormon who lived in the late 19th century. In 1831, McNemar spoke of seeing \"two transparent stones in the form of spectacles\" through which he \"looked on the engraving & afterwards put his face into a hat & the interpretation then flowed into his mind,\" according to a Deseret Evening News article from the time. The researchers say the spectacles were based on McNemar's description of seeing two \"transparent stones\" in the well, and they believe Smith used them to typeset the book in modern English. In the book's Latin section, for instance, the words \"an,\" \"reed,\" and \"thou\" are used in Latin, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. But a researcher says he's found handwriting that suggests Joseph actually dictated the text in another language.",

The images of the \"seer stone\" that Mormons believe founder Joseph Smith used to translate buried gold plates he said he found in upstate New York 185 years ago were released as part of what the church says is an effort to be more transparent about its past, the AP reports. The photos have been published in a book that also includes pictures of the \"printer's manuscript\" of the Book of Mormon\u2014a handwritten copy of the original manuscript that was produced by one of Smith's scribes. The book, which Smith said he translated from \"reformed Egyptian\" with the stone, recounts a visit from Jesus Christ to North America, reports the Salt Lake Tribune. As for the translation, the church has this to say: \"Joseph placed ... the seer stone in a hat, pressed his face into the hat to block out extraneous light, and read aloud the English words that appeared on the instrument.\" It says the translation occurred over three months in 1829 as part of a \"a series of miraculous events.\" Indeed: In March, the Deseret News reported that the church says it takes roughly five years to translate and then produce the Book of Mormon in another language. The church says it is trying to make its history more \"tangible\" with the release, but Terryl Givens, professor of literature and religion at the University of Richmond, tells the AP that the church is also trying to show skeptics it has nothing to hide. \"Other churches' origins are concealed by the mist of history. Mormonism is the first world religion in which the origins were exposed to public view, to documentation, to journalists, and newspaper reporting.\" (Last year, the church admitted that Smith had up to 40 wives.)"

Sessions said Mayor Rahm Emanuel has complained that the federal government is demanding a \"reordering of law enforcement practice\"\u2014but that is what is needed to combat \"the culture of lawlessness that has beset the city.\" \"It's this simple: Comply with the law or forgo taxpayer dollars,\" Sessions said. Chicago is suing over plans to withhold police grant funding from cities that fail to meet federal conditions, including granting immigration officials unlimited access to police stations, the Chicago Tribune reports. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Monday that the federal government's plans will damage public safety and community policing. \"Undocumented immigrants are not driving violence in Chicago, and that\u2019s why I want our officers focused on community policing and not trying to be the immigration police,\" he said, per the Chicago Sun-Times."

Some 200 flag-shaped lapel pins featuring a photo of Kim Jong Il were also discovered in a hotel flowerbed near Incheon International Airport on Thursday, reports Stars and Stripes. These are no ordinary pins: As Atlas Obscura explains, they're a patriotic symbol distributed by North Korea's Workers' Party to be worn by all adults on the left side of the chest. Some say Kim Jong Un's wife disappeared after failing to wear one in public. Other versions feature Kim Il Sung, and a rare few show both former leaders. These are only given to high-ranking government officials and military leaders, though ordinary citizens can get a knock-off version from China on the black market. North Koreans were even using the pins in place of cash before the Workers' Party made it illegal. Police are investigating how the pins got into the flowerbed as possession of such items is illegal in South Korea, but say they may have arrived via a propaganda balloon.

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 On March 18, 1990, two men dressed as police officers broke into Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum and stole 13 priceless works of art\u2014including works by Rembrandt, Vermeer, Degas, and Manet\u2014for an estimated $500 million. Now the FBI is asking for the public's help in identifying a visitor who entered the museum the night before the theft and may have seen one of the works, the Boston Globe reports. \"With the public\u2019s help, we may be able to develop new information that could lead to the recovery of these invaluable works,\" US Attorney Carmen Ortiz says in a press release. The low-resolution video shows a security guard appearing to hit an intercom button, then to grant access to a man who can be seen in the museum's reception area at 12:49am on March 17, 1990. The man is also seen getting out of a car matching the general description of one. Authorities say the video \"is compelling in that perhaps the identity of this person ... will shed new light on exactly what happened March 18 who else may be involved,\" the New York Times reports.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The FBI hopes new surveillance footage released today will aid in the recovery of 13 priceless artworks stolen 25 years ago and help put to rest one of Boston's greatest mysteries. In the early hours of March 18, 1990, two men dressed as cops were let into the Gardner Museum, where they tied up two security guards and absconded with the artwork and the museum's security footage, the Boston Globe reports. But the thieves, who have never been identified, may have missed one key thing. According to the FBI, surveillance footage from the day before the robbery shows a security guard letting a man into the museum\u2014against protocol\u2014through the same door later used in the robbery. The Globe reports it's unclear why this footage wasn't viewed by law enforcement earlier, but it could show a \"dry run\" of the heist. The newspaper identifies Richard Abath as the security guard in the footage, and the FBI is hoping the public can help identify the mystery man he lets in. Abath, a rock musician at the time who now lives in Vermont, has claimed he had no part in the robbery, but this new footage appears to contradict a number of his statements. No one has ever been charged with stealing the art\u2014for which there is a $5 million reward\u2014and no one ever will, as the statute of limitations has expired. Someone in possession of the paintings, however, could face charges. Their total value exceeds $500 million, reports AP."

If you bought $100 of the cryptocurrency that day, you'd be sitting on about $75 million, Business Insider reports. Now, every single bitcoin is worth more than $2,100, which is a new high for the digital currency, CNBC reports. One bitcoin was worth $280 in early 2014 and $900 at the end of 2016. The digital currency's value is believed to be linked to policy changes in Japan and China that have made it easier for speculators to trade in bitcoins. The price of a bitcoin has soared more than 5,000% since last December, making it the most valuable currency on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Bitcoin can be bought and sold using any number of wallets, meaning people can send it, for example, to someone who wants to buy them a drink.

Analysts say several factors are behind the steep rise in the price of the currency, including political uncertainty worldwide and the ironing out of technical issues.

That's a pretty healthy profit for the collector who bought the outfit decades ago for just $20 as it was on the verge of being tossed out. James Tumblin, who used to work at Universal Studios, says he came across the dress while doing research at a costume company in the early 1960s. \"I saw this dress on the floor and a docent told me not to bother to pick it up, because they were throwing it away,\" he says, per the Telegraph. Tumblin asked if he could sell it and was told to keep it. He bought it for $20 after noticing a label on the back that said Selznick International Pictures and \"Scarlett production dress\" was written in ink. Other standout items included a straw hat worn by Leigh in a number of scenes in the movie and a gray wool suit worn by Clark Gable as his character, Rhett Butler. The outfit, a jacket and full skirt ensemble, was worn in several key scenes, including when Scarlett O\u2019Hara encounters Rhett Butler and when she gets attacked in the shanty town. When Leigh wore it in the film, it was slate blue-gray. Over the years, it's faded to light gray.

But \"I had noticed there was a printed label saying Selznick International Pictures, and 'Scarlett production dress' was written in ink,\" he said. \"I asked if he would sell it to me.\" He ended up paying just $20 for the costume, worn by Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara in four scenes of the 1939 film\u2014an incredible bargain considering the dress sold at auction on Saturday for $137,000. The outfit\u2014really a jacket and skirt ensemble\u2014was actually pale blue during filming. But some of the 150 Gone With the Wind pieces sold by Heritage Auctions this weekend remain in pristine condition, including a gray wool suit Clark Gable wore when he kicked down Scarlett O'Hara's boudoir door as Rhett Butler, CNN reports; it sold for $55,000. A straw hat worn by Leigh fetched $52,500, while a black bonnet donned by Leigh and Olivia de Havilland's character Melanie Wilkes sold for $30,000, Reuters reports. Tumblin seems happy to have been able to offer up his pieces, many of which have toured the country. \"I am really looking forward to walking through a museum and seeing something that I once owned,\" he said.

Unfortunately, this crucial forage fish appears to be in the midst of a severe population decline. Its absence will be felt by dozens of species of West Coast seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish su...",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 The Pacific sardine fishery is in the midst of what the Los Angeles Times calls the \"biggest sardine crash in generations.\" The small, energy-rich fish used to be a staple on the West Coast, but they're down 72% since their last peak in 2006, and scientists say the effects are rippling through the ecosystem, starving brown pelicans, sea lions, and other predators that rely on the oily fish for food. The decline has prompted steep cuts in the amount fishermen are allowed to catch, and federal fishery managers slashed harvest limits by more than two-thirds in November. Sardines are famously volatile, but the decline is the steepest since the sardine fishery in the mid-20th century. And their numbers are projected to keep sliding. One factor is a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which in recent years has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West coast. While those conditions have brought a boom in some species, such as market squid, they have repelled sardines. If nature is responsible for the decline, history shows the fish will bounce back when ocean conditions improve. But without a full understanding of the causes, the crash is raising alarm. Sea lions are starving to death because they don't have enough sardines to eat, National Marine Fisheries Service researchers say. The theory is based on new research that found sea lion mothers couldn't find the fatty fish, so they fed on squid, rockfish, and hake instead. \" sardines are one of the most cautiously fished in the world,\" says a NOAA official.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment\u2014the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans\u2014which also depend on sardines for food\u2014are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)\u2014and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing. Last month, Pew Charitable Trusts warned that dozens of species, including whales, sharks, dolphins, salmon, and tuna, could feel an impact."

Butterfield then started filming. The white bystander, who had a key to the building, let the group inside; the first white man then insisted they not get on the elevator with him and asked repeatedly whether they had a key to the building. As the group attempted to enter the elevator, the man pulled out a gun. \"He made sure we saw that he had a gun so we didn't get in the elevator,\" says Butterfield, who notes that the group had earlier questioned whether the man actually lived in the building, since it is student housing and he looked older than most residents. (At one point in the video, the man can be heard saying, \"Where am I going? I am going upstairs to get laid.\") The students, who were ultimately let into the building by their friend, reported the incident to police the following day. Building management has since released a statement saying the man in the video is not a resident. Social media users identified him, and his employer announced he has been fired from his position as general manager of a nearby hotel."

In a study published in PLOS Pathogens, CDC researchers say the virus, called Bourbon virus, was found in the blood of a man who died in Kansas earlier this year. The 51-year-old had a history of tick exposure, as well as symptoms similar to those seen in ticks in the area, including fever, chills, and loss of appetite, the Kansas City Star reports. However, the man didn't respond to antibiotics for three days after his illness onset and had no response to other ticks. The virus, named Araguari after Uganda, is believed to have originated in the Democratic Republic of Congo and spread through Central America and South America before making its way to the US in the 1980s, USA Today reports. It has no known history of transmission between humans or animals. The man, who had recently traveled to Mexico, had underlying health conditions that may have contributed to his death, per a Tennessee Department of Health press release. Since 2009, eight people in Missouri and Tennessee have been diagnosed with the Heartland virus, which causes high fevers and diarrhea, fatigue, and a drop in the number of their white blood cells, NBC News reports. \"I think it has probably been present for a while,\" a researcher tells the Star.",

Just one example of the Thogotovirus has appeared in the US, the researchers write in a CDC publication: Aransas Bay virus, found in ticks in a seabird nest off Texas. Though the Kansas death is the first scientists have linked to the illness, Staples believes it has probably affected others; they just didn't know it. That doesn't mean we should panic, she notes; we should just continue to protect ourselves against ticks, which may be carriers.

Researchers scanned the brains of 1,187 healthy people between the ages of 3 and 20 and found, for instance, that the size of the hippocampus tends to be smaller in those with the e2/e4 combination. They also found some kids with e4 didn't perform as well on tests of memory, though they caught up with their peers by age 10, reports HealthDay News. And while brain researcher Rebecca Knickmeyer, who didn't participate in the study but wrote an accompanying editorial, says the variants aren't necessarily predictive and people shouldn't start testing their kids, the research suggests that Alzheimer's may in fact be a developmental disorder, not strictly an aging one, reports the Los Angeles Times. That raises the possibility that adjustments to \"diet or cognitive training\" early on could change someone's \"trajectory,\" per Knickmeyer. Three in four people have at least one copy of e3, which seems to offer a protective effect. About 14% of people have an e4 variant, which has been linked with an elevated risk of Alzheimer's, but Knickmeyer points out that there are many Alzheimer's patients without e4, and many with e4 who never develop Alzheimer's.

I just don't understand,\" a frustrated Abts-Olsen can be heard asking on his dashcam video. \"I don't understand it either,\" the man replies. The man was arrested on suspicion of drug possession."

Gregory Jean Jr. had been physically abused and had tried to leave the home in the past, police say. His father, stepmother, and three teenage children have been arrested and charged with false imprisonment, cruelty to children, and obstruction. Police were first called to the home Friday night, but when they went back the next night, they didn't find the boy. On Saturday morning, he was reunited with his mother. \"The point today is that the child is safe,\" says Clayton County Police Chief Gregory Porter. \"There are a lot of unanswered questions at this point.\" Gregory's father, 37, and stepmom, 42, have denied knowing anything about another child living at the home. Gregory used an app to send his mother text messages, including a photo of the garage. After police resumed their search shortly after midnight, he passed those messages to police, who continued questioning the other residents of the house and searching. A police sergeant found the boy, who looked \"absolutely afraid,\" in a closet on the third floor. He thanked officers for helping him, and later posed for photos with police while smiling widely.",

But the officers had help from Gregory himself, because it was the texts and photos he sent to his mom that helped police track down where the missing 13-year-old was hidden in his father and stepmother's house, the AP reports. And although Gregory Jean Sr., 37, and Samantha Joy Davis, 42, didn't bar police from searching the home, \"there was a lot of deception,\" Clayton County Police Sgt. Joanne Southerland told reporters, as per CNN. In fact, the first officers on the scene\u2014sent after a 911 call from the boy's mother\u2014came up empty-handed and left after Jean and Davis said they knew nothing. After the police left, young Gregory contacted his mom again through the magicJack app and she redialed 911; when Southerland, who had worked in a Crimes Against Children unit for several years, heard that call, she made police go back and search again. \"We weren't going to leave until we found him,\" she tells WXIA. The space Gregory was crammed into had nothing but wooden beams and insulation\u2014\"a space where no person should be living,\" the local police chief told reporters.

The Census also found that more kids are being raised in single-parent homes, with 27% of kids under 18 living in such homes last year, up from 9% in 1960. The median age for people first getting married in 2014 was 29 for men and 27 for women.",

That number is particularly alarming when compared to pre-recession levels: In 2007, some 9 million, or one in eight, kids were on food stamps. There are currently about 46 million Americans total on food stamps, down from the 2013 peak of 48 million. The jump signals what Reuters says is a \"lop-sided\" economic recovery that has left low-income people behind, but it also underscores a fundamental partisan divide over social welfare programs.

Democrats, meanwhile, argue that it's too soon to scale back the program. Meanwhile, some other highlights from the Census numbers: 27% of children live in single-parent homes, three times the 9% who did in 1960 10% of kids live with a grandparent, 15% have a stay-at-home mom, 0.6% have a stay-at-home dad, and 38% have at least one foreign-born parent 48% of households are made up of married couples, down from 76% in 1940 Americans are continuing to marry later, at a median age of 29 for men and 27 for women; that's up from 24 and 21 in 1947"

A study published Tuesday in Circulation Research found that long-term exposure to PPIs \"accelerated biological aging in human endothelial cells which line the inside of blood vessels,\" according to a press release. When healthy cells create a Teflon-like coating that prevents blood from sticking, the endothelium becomes more like Velcro, with blood elements sticking to the vessel to form blockages. \"Lysosomes are like the garbage disposal of cells,\" says the study's lead author. \"They need to generate acid to get rid of cellular rubbish, and when cellular rubbish accumulates the cells age faster.\" The study found that one type of PPI, esomeprazole ( Nexium), impairs acid production by the lysosomes in the cells lining the blood vessel walls. In turn, the buildup of waste caused the cell to age faster. \"With the knowledge that PPIs are being used by millions of people for indications and durations that were never tested or approved, it may be time for the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory agencies to re-visit the specificity and the safety of these agents,\" the lead author says. \"Unless otherwise indicated, physicians should.\" Click for more.",

But a preliminary report just released by the American Heart Association is concerned that the drug\u2014already associated with a higher risk of heart attack and other vascular problems, as the AHA reported earlier this year\u2014may also increase one's risk of ischemic stroke, the most common type caused when a clot cuts off blood flow to the brain. \"At one time, PPIs were thought to be safe, without major side effects,\" the study's lead author says. \u201cThis study further questions the cardiovascular safety of these drugs.\" Researchers followed nearly a quarter-million patients in Denmark who were suffering from stomach pain and indigestion and had an endoscopy. Their average age was 57, and six years later those taking one of four PPIs (Prilosec, Protonix, Prevacid, or Nexium) had a 21% higher risk of stroke than those not taking one. Lowest-dose PPIs didn't increase the risk much if at all, while highest-dose increased it, from 30% for Prevacid to 94% for Protonix. Another type of acid-lowering meds called H2 blockers (think Pepcid and Zantac) showed no elevated risk. \"As a culture, we tend to want a pill to deal with our problems, when a lot of people could reduce their heartburn by eating smaller meals, drinking less alcohol, or not smoking,\" one doc told CNN in 2010.

If true, that would contradict DA Mary Lacy's claim that the killer was an intruder. \"It's certainly possible that an intruder was responsible for the murder, but I don't think that the DNA evidence proves,\" one forensic expert tells the Denver Post. The new evidence involves a DNA profile known as \"unknown male\" that investigators used in the case. The profile was never able to replicate itself because it contained markers from more than two people. District Attorney Mary Lacy concluded that the profile belonged to only one person who killed the 6-year-old beauty queen in 1996, reports the Daily Camera.

At the time, Lacy concluded that DNA evidence found on JonBenet's underwear and long johns belonged to a male intruder who was not part of the Ramsey family. But now three forensic experts who examined the DNA test results and lab reports used by Lacy say they do not support her conclusion. For one thing, a sample on her underwear identified as coming from \"Unknown Male 1\" may in fact be a composite from multiple people and thus \"worthless as evidence,\" says the news report. Another revelation that further muddles the picture: DNA samples on her long johns appear to come from JonBenet and at least two other people, not one, a fact that has never been revealed before. What's more, the independent experts say all of the unknown DNA may be the result of \"inconsequential contact with other people,\" reports the Camera. With the exoneration, \"I was trying to prevent a horrible travesty of justice,\" Lacy tells ABC. (The interview was done before these latest revelations.) \"I was scared to death that despite the fact that there was no evidence, no psychopathy, and no motive, the case was a train going down the track and the Ramseys were tied to that track.\" Comparison to the DNA profile now in doubt was used to exonerate dozens of other potential suspects.

It's not over, either: Storms are poised to strike regions from Dallas to Memphis until tomorrow and Arkansas through Monday. The north will also get its share, with sleet or snow hitting central New England through the central Appalachians into today, and blanketing the nation's capital tomorrow. In other details: Dallas/Forth Worth had it worst, canceling nearly 700 flights and the downtown Dallas holiday parade for the first time in 26 years. The storm cut out power for more than 200,000 customers. Temperature swings were shocking: In Hot Springs, Arkansas, a temperate 75-degree day on Wednesday turned into an ice storm yesterday. Most fatalities occurred on icy roads, including the death of Granby, Missouri, Mayor Ronald Arnall, whose car veered off a state highway in southern Missouri and hit a tree, Reuters reports. Oklahoma alone has recorded about 116 storm-related injuries. A new storm struck the Pacific Coast yesterday, dropping pretty heavy snow on Portland.

Arron Hughes, 28, tells the Daily Post that he was on a stag do in Vegas when he decided to take a dip in the water below the 725-foot structure. \"We were all just standing there, and I thought, 'f--- it! I'm going for a swim,'\" he says. \"I got to the bottom and thought 'I can make that.'\" Hughes says he made it across first, then swam back\u2014but he was nearly swept away by the water as he was dragged under by nine turbines that weren't in operation. He survived only because most of the turbines were turned off, although he had a close shave with one that was working. Hughes, a forklift driver, says he took 30 minutes to make the swim\u2014and was arrested immediately after getting out of the water. \"Even though I was knackered halfway across, I knew I had to get to the other side,\" he tells the Telegraph. \"The water was pulling me in towards the dam.\" Police were waiting for him when he climbed back out and he was put into handcuffs before being issued the fine.

But he apparently had luck on his side: Only one of the 10 hydroelectric turbines were powered on during his swim. \"I swam from Arizona to Nevada,\" he tells the Post. \"I went across first and then swam back. ... It took about 30 minutes to do. Even though I was knackered half way across I knew I had to get to the other side.\" He reportedly told the Sun that he was about 160 feet from the dam and felt a strong tug. \"I was sucked towards the wall and had to swim hard.\" He says police were waiting for him and handcuffed him for what he didn't realize wasn't permitted, as he says there aren't any \"no swimming\" signs posted. \"You're just expected not to.\" He says he ended up getting fined about $330, but, as the tattoo on his body reads, per the Times of London: \"No regrets.\" (This bachelor party ended up being a scam.)"

One even includes a well house being used as \u2026 a chicken coop. The US Army Corps of Engineers says it is working on fixing the issues. The report also finds that the US plan to fund hundreds of millions of dollars worth of infrastructure projects in the country is extremely behind schedule\u2014and that some of the ambitious plans may actually hurt the country, the Washington Post adds. The report raises concerns about the 2014 withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan and questions whether local forces are prepared to take over security duties\u2014and whether this new infrastructure can be successfully maintained by a country with limited resources.

Thank you to the FBI, the incredible men and women who are working this case, and to the many law enforcement agencies who have worked so hard to bring this evil person to justice.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The Anti-Defamation League says the shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh is thought to be the deadliest attack specifically targeting Jews ever in the US\u2014by far. CNN reports the previous attack to have that label occurred in 1985, when Seattle lawyer Charles Goldmark, his wife, and two sons were killed. (The Washington Post notes it \"was actually a case of mistaken religious identity,\" as the family was not Jewish.) The toll in Saturday's shooting stands at 11. The AP reports police on Sunday said the victims were eight men and three women. In an arrest affidavit made public, police say that while treating alleged shooter Robert Gregory Bowers for injuries he sustained after being shot by police, he said Jews were \"committing genocide to his people\" and that he wanted them all to die. The AP separately reports on a \"vulnerability\" the shooter took advantage of: an unlocked door. While the Tree of Life synagogue required guests to ring a bell to gain access during the week, on the Jewish Sabbath the building was open to all guests for Shabbat services. The Post quotes the FBI special agent in charge as saying it was \"the most horrific crime scene I\u2019ve seen in 22 years.\" Federal hate crime charges were filed against Bowers on Saturday: 29 charges in all, including 11 counts of using a firearm to commit murder. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports Pittsburgh police also filed charges on Saturday: 11 counts of criminal homicide, six counts of attempted homicide, six counts of aggravated assault, and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 An amazing, if grisly, feat continues to resonate after a report in Thursday's Globe and Mail of Toronto. The newspaper, quoting military sources, says a Canadian sniper in Iraq killed an ISIS militant from the mind-boggling distance of 3,540 meters, or 2.2 miles. The Canadian military has not confirmed what would be the longest kill shot by a sniper in history, but the story has in the meantime drawn attention to something else: the remarkable prowess of Canadian snipers in general. Some coverage: The training: If confirmed, that means the sniper record has been broken four times in the last 15 years, three of those times by Canadians, notes Maclean's magazine. One reason, it says, is because Canadian snipers \"are not simply taught to hit their targets.\" The training goes beyond their shooting duties, making sure they're able to \"design and run complex operations\" if necessary. \"That in itself may not make them better snipers but the gestalt of sniper-training and command-thinking combined could explain their skill.\" Long history: The CBC examines the history of Canada's military marksmanship, noting that Cpl. Francis Pegahmagabow of the 1st Canadian Infantry Battalion had 378 kills, making him deadliest sniper of World War I. A military historian says the skill carried into WWII. \"The best snipers were usually country boys who knew how to hunt.\" Official statement: The Canadian military has not confirmed the kill, but it did confirm the shot. \"A member of the Joint Task Force 2 successfully hit a target from 3,540 meters,\" it says in an email to NPR, adding that it won't divulge further details for troop safety. Really? The Globe and Mail says the shot was verified by video and data, but that hasn't emerged yet, and some are skeptical. The Washington Post talks to former US snipers who say that even seeing a human target would be difficult from that distance, even with advanced scopes. A theory floated by a former Marine shooter: \"A spotter with an advanced optical device was able to verbally walk the sniper onto the target and correct his aim.\u201d Yes: Canadian Cpl. Rob Furlong, who once held the record himself at 2,430 meters, counters the skeptics: \u201cIt\u2019s not an impossible distance,\u201d he says. \u201cSo to the naysayers I would just say, this can be done.\u201d It's a \"hell of a shot,\" adds former Canadian sniper Jody Mitic, who was written a book called, of course, Unflinching: The Making of a Canadian Sniper. A critic: In a post at Stuff.co.nz, John Edens thinks the shot was possible, given high-tech gizmos to account for everything from wind speed to the curvature of the earth. Plus, the gun used, a McMillan TAC-50 rifle, employs a 50-caliber bullet the size of a \"large cigar.\" His beef, though, is with media coverage that he thinks glorifies war. \"It's an achievement to a point, but it's not really one humanity should be proud of.\""

The Times uncovered a secret report compiled by a city department this year that found that 129 Rikers inmates suffered \"serious injuries\" in altercations with staff members over an 11-month span last year; 77% of those inmates had a mental health diagnosis. In most cases, the inmates were beaten while handcuffed. The Times investigated the incidents individually, and offer some disturbing details: When guards found Jose Bautista trying to hang himself, they saved him, but then allegedly threw him to the ground and punched him with such force that they perforated his bowel. It was one of five beatings noted in the report that followed a suicide attempt. Bautista needed emergency surgery, but guards took nine hours to drive him to the hospital\u2014which is only 15 minutes away. When Andre Lane threw water or urine at guards, they allegedly handcuffed him to a gurney, wheeled him to a clinic that wasn't monitored by security cameras, and beat him so violently that the walls and cabinets were covered with his blood. After Brian Mack complained that guards were stealing inmates' food, a guard captain allegedly hit him in the eye with his radio, while another officer punched him in the jaw. He came away with a broken eye socket and jaw. Correction officials said he'd been in a fight with another inmate, but investigators noted no such fight was logged in prison records. None of the guards involved in any of the cases have faced criminal charges\u2014or even administrative ones. Rikers has been under pressure to reform its treatment of mentally ill inmates\u2014in January, for example, it announced it would stop putting the \"seriously mentally ill\" in solitary, though the Times notes that classification applies to a small segment of the population.

After graduating from college two years ago, Saddam got a job with a shipping company, but it refused to hire him. \"People are scared to hire me,\" he says. \"I am an innocent victim of somebody else's crimes.\" So Saddam went to court to change his name, and a judge gave him the go-ahead to do so on May 5, though it's not clear whether he'll be able to get a new passport, driving license, or school certificate under his new name. \"It is not only us who hate you, the entire country hates you,\" a friend tells the Times of India of Saddam, who says he's known by many names, including Saddam Hussein, during his childhood in Baghdad. (The former dictator was hanged in 2006.)",

Hussain was, yes, named for that Saddam Hussein; the name was given to him by his grandfather. It turned out to be a poor choice, as the young man has been unable to find a job since graduating university two years ago, despite having done very well in school. And he's applied for dozens of positions. He says he's spoken with some of the HR departments of companies he's applied with, and they told him his name was the problem, because it could cause \"suspicion.\" One recruitment expert points out that this would be a problem especially if a job requires travel abroad, during which he might get stopped by airport or border authorities: \"He might just keep getting stuck or the company has to pull him out of the sticky situation, making the hire cumbersome,\" the expert says. Hussain got his first name legally changed to Sajid, but though he got all his official documents changed to reflect his new name, his original name still poses a problem because it's listed on educational certificates, which prospective employers want to see. He's working on getting those certificates changed as well, but the process is moving slowly, the BBC reports. (Meanwhile, in America, a guy is trying to change his name to Hitler.)"

The findings are preliminary, and more studies need to be done, but researchers say the results suggest that personality traits can be expressed physiologically, including through our emotions, reports MyHealthNewsDaily.

The editorial ends with a plea for voters, protesters, members of Congress, state legislators, the courts, the media, etc., to be vigilant about protecting America from its own president. On Monday, part two focuses on Trump's capacity to lie. Plenty of politicians lie, of course, but what Trump \"brings to the equation is an apparent disregard for fact so profound as to suggest that he may not see much practical distinction between lies, if he believes they serve him, and the truth.\" What makes this especially dangerous is that Trump repeats the lies of others, even crackpots. \"He gives every indication that he is as much the gullible tool of liars as he is the liar in chief.\" Verification seems to be a foreign concept to Trump, but it can't be for everyone else, write the editors, who close with advice: \"Investigate. Read. Write. Listen. Speak. Think. ... Be suspicious of those who confuse reality with reality TV, and those who repeat falsehoods while insisting, against all evidence, that they are true. To defend freedom, demand fact.\" Read part one and part two."

The bunker, built during the Cold War, was filled with Soviet-era weapons and abandoned after the fall of the Soviet Union, LiveScience reports. During that time, thousands of wood ants fell down a ventilation pipe into the bunker and couldn't climb back up. So the ants built a nest over the pipe and stuck it there for years. But when the pipe was finally removed, the open hole left by thousands of ants forced the ants to build a new nest over it, according to a study published in the Journal of Hymenoptera. \"Flat parts of the mound and the adjacent spaces ... were carpeted with bodies of dead ants,\" the researchers say. \"The sheer numbers of dead bodies suggest that this orphaned wood ants nest has been active for years, building a nest from soil and maintaining it in typical wood ant fashion. Except, of course, it's far from normal.\" The researchers estimate that several hundred thousand ants, possibly a million, call the bizarre barren mound home.

What sounds like a death sentence (they can\u2019t climb out, there is no food, and it is very cold) has turned into a survival story because these worker ants keep doing what they always do: building until they die. And when they do? \"A younger generation is on its way, ready to cart off the fallen to a two-million-strong ant cemetery beyond the mound and continue their endless, pointless labor,\" reports Inverse. Researchers write in the Journal of Hymenoptera that a million or so trapped ants have managed to carry on in a virtual Cold War nightmare, living in a near-starvation state and total darkness. The colony rests atop a thick cemetery of ant ancestors, indicating this has been going on for quite some time. Zoologists who stumbled upon the odd discovery in Templewo while counting bats doubted cannibalism was keeping the insects alive, suggesting bat excrement could be doing the trick. The ants produce no offspring, and so the colony's survival depends on surface ants making the same mistake they did. Wood ants are known to be resilient, though, with one colony surviving on a barren islet for nearly 30 years with only pine trees to munch, the researchers write.

Another factor: Because of the planes' relatively light frames, they can be pressurized to 6,000 feet, which the airline says allows for more humidity and makes the air pressure inside the aircraft closer to the pressure on the ground than is the case with most jets, per Quartz. A third factor is the jet's filtration system, which replaces the air in the cabin in its entirety every two to three minutes. The idea there is that, if nothing else, the improved air quality should help people sleep better on long flights. And the big question: Has it worked? It's a little too early to tell. The first such jet landed in the US only earlier this month via Qatar Airways, though other airlines plan to add the jet to their fleets, notes a post at Science Alert. (This protein might provide another way to fight jet lag.)"

This time, Israel \"has publicly framed a clear agenda targeting tunnels it says militants built to store weapons or stage attacks on its territory.

Edelman tells the New York Times that he received a direct message late last month warning him that somebody in his comment section had posted: \"I'm going to shoot my school up watch the news.\" \"I said, holy Toledo, what is going on?\" Edelman says. He spoke to assistant Shannon Moen, who found the message among hundreds of comments on one of Edelman's posts and called 911. Police were able to track the message to a home in Port Huron, Mich., where a 14-year-old boy was arrested. Police say the teen, a Central Middle School student, admitted making the threat. WDIV reports that two rifles belonging to the boy's grandfather were found at the home. The boy, who is now being held in a juvenile detention center, has been charged with making a false report of a terrorist threat, a felony that could get him up to four years in prison. Edelman says he wants to thank the person who alerted him, who has the Instagram handle jesseyi3. \"Thankfully, this kid said something,\" Edelman says. \"We're going to send him something, a care package, just for his work. He's the real hero.\" (Police say this would-be school shooter in Ohio changed his mind at the last second.)"

According to the Los Angeles Times, Trump called illegal immigration a \"humanitarian disaster\" for Mexico and the US and said the two countries have a \"mutual agreement\" to stop the \"illegal movement of people, drugs, and weapons\" along the US-Mexico border. But when asked if Mexico would pay for Trump's border wall, Trump said the talks were \"preliminary\" and there was \"no discussion\" of that. \"I happen to have a tremendous feeling for Mexican-Americans,\" Politico quotes Trump as saying. Trump was expected to fly to the president's official residence across town from the airport for a meeting and press statement. Trump is expected to deliver a speech on immigration later Wednesday.",

But: \"We didn't discuss payment of the wall.\" But ABC News reports Pe\u00f1a Nieto later took to Twitter, claiming he did in fact tell Trump Mexico wouldn't pay for the wall, essentially calling the candidate a liar. During the news conference, Trump maintained it was America's right to build a wall, Pe\u00f1a Nieto says any talk of border security needs to include stopping the flow of money and guns into Mexico, according to Politico. In addition to not addressing his long-made claim that Mexico would pay for the wall, Trump also softened his rhetoric on Mexican immigrants. \"I happen to have a tremendous feeling for Mexican-Americans,\" Salon quotes Trump as saying. And Pe\u00f1a Nieto insisted that all Mexican nationals living in the US \"deserve the respect of everyone.\" Trump ended his speech by calling Pe\u00f1a Nieto, a man who once compared him to Hitler, a \"friend.\" Pe\u00f1a Nieto characterized his discussion with Trump as \"open and constructive.\" He says he believes Trump really does want to help Mexico via his policies, the AP reports. Both men are \"extremely unpopular\" in Mexico, as the Times puts it."

They also found that men were more likely than women to have had more than one sexual encounter in the previous 12 months. The lead researcher tells the Times that it's possible that relationship permanency plays a role, or that sicker men in younger marriages are responsible for the higher frequency of sex. \"Growing old as a couple, with the experience and knowledge that come with that, may play a part,\" says one of the study's authors. \"You are able to learn about your partner and build on that over time.

Fortunately we were able to stop the workmen just before they began to wield pickaxes to break up the mosaic layer.\" Irwin called in Historic England, whose archaeologists confirmed that the mosaic had formed part the floor of the villa. The villa, which Irwin believes was home to an emperor's family between AD 175 and 220, is now being called \"unparalleled in recent years\" by archaeologists from Historic England and the Salisbury Museum. It's thought to have been three stories high, similar in height to other Roman buildings in the area, reports the Telegraph. The shell is believed to have belonged to a man named Irwin Fishbourne, who lived in the city of Chichester some 1,500 years ago. \"Some of the oyster shells we have found have not been touched by another human for more than 1,500 years, and now we have uncovered them lying around our house.

Irwin and his wife, who recently moved to the property with their children, had decided to add lights to their barn so they could play table tennis at night. Though electricians suggested overhead lines, the couple opted to bury them, and workers hit a hard layer about 18 inches down. It proved to be pieces of mosaic. Irwin, who designs \"luxury rugs for the Roman aristocrats of today,\" says he knew right away it was a significant find. \"Fortunately,\" he recalls, \"we were able to stop the workmen just before they began to wield pickaxes.\" Irwin contacted Historic England, and archaeologists rushed to the property to begin an excavation. Calling the site \"hugely valuable,\" Roberts tells the Guardian the discovery \"is unparalleled in recent years and it gives us a perfect opportunity to understand Roman and post-Roman Britain.\" It's not just the size of the building, believed to be three stories, that indicates it was the home of an important Roman: It's the stuff scientists have found along with the house\u2014discarded oyster shells, for instance, which would have been imported from the coast. \"High-status pottery,\" coins, and the mosaic flooring itself all point to wealth.

Liberia has closed its border crossings; Nigeria\u2019s airports, seaports, and borders have been on \"red alert\"; and West African airports are screening passengers for signs of illness. Since February, 1,200 people have been infected with Ebola, and 672 people in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have died; the fatality rate in this outbreak is 60%. Here\u2019s what you need to know about Ebola: It's possible that Ebola can jump from animals to humans through \"bush meat\" such as apes, monkeys, antelope, and porcupines, reports NBC News. Once an outbreak starts, it moves from person to person. The fatality rate is 50% to 90%. Early treatment is vital. The virus spreads through bodily fluids such as vomit and diarrhea; it\u2019s infectious when the victim shows symptoms and remains so after the patient's death. Many have contracted Ebola by preparing a corpse for burial. Up to 60% of patients will bleed from the eyes and skin. There is no cure, and antivirals aren\u2019t effective. The only way to get a diagnosis is with a blood test, adds the Wall Street Journal."

The bill, which was introduced by Rep. Robert Goodlatte, R- Va., would require copyright owners to pay licensing fees if they want excerpts of speeches to be made public. But the King estate, which has licensed the film Selma's rights to some of King's speeches, argues that such a mandate would force authors to pay hefty licensing fees. \"Sadly, the lawyers for some members of Dr. King\u2019s family don\u2019t see it that way,\" writes John Fund at the National Review.",

She knew DreamworksSKG owns them for a future Steven Spielberg film, and that \"with those rights came a certain collaboration\"\u2014ie, estate influence over King's portrayal. Why is it legal? Because King was a private citizen, not a government official, so his speeches and writings were his and passed onto his estate. What's more, Congress has extended copyright protection to the author's life plus 70 years (matching international standards), so MLK's work will become public domain on Jan. 1, 2039. The family has mostly kept quiet about all this, USA Today reports, but one of King's sons, Dexter, has written that \"people don't want us, as the heirs, the estate, to benefit ... or for my family to be in any way comfortable.\" Yet the estate does have limits: It initially demanded $20,000 from Clarence Jones, King's personal attorney and speechwriter, for including the \"I Have a Dream\" speech in a book\u2014but Jones published anyway, and the estate backed off, the National Review reports."

Chancellor Nicholas S. Zeppos called the inscription on Confederate Memorial Hall \"a reminder of racism, slavery and a very, very bloody Civil War.\" The Nashville university's efforts to change the name in 2002 were halted when the United Daughters of the Confederacy sued. The group\u2019s $50,000 donation in 1933 helped build the dorm. A state appeals court ruled the building could be renamed Memorial Hall only after Vanderbilt gave the United Daughters back their money\u2014$1.2 million in today\u2019s dollars. The university has the cash, thanks to a raft of anonymous contributors who wanted the tie to America\u2019s painful past broken for good. \"It's a symbol that is, for many people, deeply offensive and painful,\" Zeppos told the Tennessean. \"And to walk past it or to have to live in that space is really something that I just don't think is acceptable.\u201d Yet tampering with Confederate imagery remains controversial, and a new state law makes it harder to do so, the AP reports. Efforts by Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro to remove the name of Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest from a building could face a tougher climb under the Tennessee Heritage Protection Act, which now requires a vote of two-thirds of the state\u2019s Historical Commission rather than a simple majority."

The 74-year-old was placed on the permanently ineligible list in 1989 after he was found to have bet on Cincinnati Reds games while he was a player and manager. Commissioner Rob Manfred says in his decision that Rose \"claims not to remember significant misconduct detailed in the Dowd Report and corroborated by Michael Bertolini's betting notebook.\" Manfred says it's \"not at all clear to me that Mr. Rose has a grasp of the scope of his violations of Rule 21.\" Rose was hit with the lifetime ban in 1989, after an investigation found that he had gambling ties with the Cincinnati Reds, his former team. In a statement, Manfred said he was \"not convinced\" that Rose has \"avoided the type of conduct and associations that originally led to his placement on the permanent ineligible list.\" He added: \"I respect Mr. ROSE's accomplishments as a player, and as result, I will.\" ESPN's Outside the Lines reported earlier this year that it had obtained a notebook that shows Rose bet on at least one MLB team\u2014including on Reds games he played\u2014on at least 30 times in a four-month period beginning in March 1986.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The MLB player with the most hits in the league's history should be a shoo-in for the Hall of Fame, but that's hard to do when you've been permanently banned from baseball\u2014again. Commissioner Rob Manfred was reportedly set to tell Pete Rose on Thursday he won't lift the permanent ban against Rose that's been in place since 1989, but queries by the New York Times appeared to expedite Manfred's announcement, which he made Monday instead. MLB.com notes Manfred informed Rose, both verbally and in writing, of his decision. The \"stark language\" of the league's rules dictates \"that the penalty for a player or manager who bets on a game in which he has a duty to perform is mandatory, permanent ineligibility,\" Manfred says in his announcement accompanying the MLB press release. He adds he had instructed staff to gather any new evidence that may have emerged since the 1989 Dowd Report that helped place Rose on the league's ineligible list, based on evidence Rose bet on baseball while managing the Cincinnati Reds\u2014including bets on his own team. In addition to a polygraph test and a private meeting between Rose and Manfred in September, that new evidence included an incriminating notebook revealed in a June ESPN report that indicates Rose also bet while still playing for the Reds. Manfred notes that during that conversation, Rose had inconsistent stories, made contradictory statements, and couldn't remember important facts from the Dowd document. Another nugget came to light during Manfred and Rose's meeting that appears to have influenced the decision. \"Significantly, [Rose] told me that currently he bets recreationally and legally on horses and sports, including Baseball,\" Manfred notes. Interestingly, Manfred says that while Rose won't be reinstated, that's an entirely different issue than whether he should be eligible for the Hall of Fame, a debate he says \"must take place in a different forum.\""

Discovery calls the timing of the hobbits' disappearance \"suspicious,\" but the study found no proof they were wiped out by humans, and further excavations on Flores are needed. Other possible causes for the extinction of Homo floresiensis include volcanoes, overhunting of pygmy elephants, and climate change. But it's not just their death that is mysterious. Scientists still don't know why these real-life hobbits were so small, how they got to Flores, or if they're even a different species. Some experts have posited they are actually humans suffering from dwarfism or Down syndrome. (Meanwhile, ancient humans having sex with Neanderthals may be why we have allergies.)"

It tells of Rosenwald's rise from the son of a peddler to a clothing manufacturing apprentice to CEO of the largest US retailer, Sears, Roebuck & Co., in 1908, reports the Times of Israel. It was around that time he began to see similarities between the treatment of blacks in America and pogroms against European Jews. When his rabbi became an NAACP leader, Rosenwald sponsored meetings. Soon after, he donated $25,000 to Alabama's Tuskegee University, led by Booker T. Washington, whose writings on racial equality and education had piqued his interest. Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest. He went on to give $62 million to various causes, including the Rosenwald Fund, which created 5,300 schools in the South, attended by prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou, George Wolfe, and Eugene Robinson. It \"was the single-most important funding agency for African-American culture in the 20th century,\" poet Rita Dove says. More than 80 years after his death, Rosenwald still inspires. \"Not all of us can be Julius Rosenwald,\" says Kempner, but \"we can all do something.\""

The Treasury Department said a series of primary and secondary sanctions\u2014those affecting American and foreign partners of Iran\u2014would go back into effect after wind-down periods specified by law.

Most of the roughly 340 people aboard managed to reach nearby Beacon Island, off Western Australia, with the ship's captain setting off in search of help in a longboat. What happened in July of that year was gruesome: The West Australian reports that more than 120 people, among them women and children, were massacred by a group of mutineers led by undermerchant Jeronimus Cornelisz: Some were felled by musket fire or swords, others poisoned or drowned. Upon the captain's return, Cornelisz and many of his men were executed, reports the BBC. The Batavia's wreck was found in 1963, and a mass grave on the island was uncovered in 1999. Australia's ABC reports that the final day of searching the island during a 2013 expedition surfaced a tooth. Upon returning, archaeologists searched the area where the tooth was uncovered and have now found the island's 11th skeleton\u2014with an archaeologist explaining it's the first to have been found using archaeology, while the others found to date were uncovered \"by accident.\" Two musket balls were recovered near the remains, which are believed to be that of a youth.

Sadly for enthusiasts of air travel and sci-fi films, it looks like the project is going to remain on the drawing board for the foreseeable future. \u201cIt\u2019s just one of many ideas,\u201d an Airbus spokesman tells Wired. \"It doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re going to be working on making it a reality.\u201d",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 If you were thinking of designing an aircraft shaped sort of like an enormous doughnut, we have some bad news for you: Airbus has already called it. The company has filed a patent application for a passenger aircraft in that very shape, the Financial Times reports. Why go for the doughnut look? Well, current aircraft face heavy pressure on their front and rear ends, requiring special support. \"The purpose of the invention is particularly to provide a simple, economic, and efficient solution to these problems,\" Airbus says. The new design, which you can view here, also offers more room for passengers, CNBC reports. The \"doughnut\" does, of course, have its drawbacks. Boarding hatches\u2014in the doughnut's \"hole\"\u2014don't clearly fit emergency exit rules, Fortune notes, and the aircraft's shape might require airport redesigns. Either way, don't expect Dunkin' Donuts to start an airline anytime soon. \"It\u2019s just one of many ideas,\u201d an Airbus rep tells Fortune. \"It doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re going to be working on making it a reality.\" In fact, the company seeks more than 600 patents yearly, the rep tells the publication (though the Financial Times puts the figure at 6,000). For instance, Airbus recently sought a patent for standing \"seats\" that are basically bike saddles. (If that's not quite your desired comfort level, maybe try a flying three-room suite.)"

Per CNN, Maddy was in such bad shape when she was brought to Lt.

Except Ojeda wasn't convinced she was only 15. And so, as Ojeda tearfully relayed at a Monday presser, he asked the girl twice how old she was; she finally answered she was 17. Based on that info, Ojeda, who thought she'd die before they got her to the children's facility, made the call to take her to a hospital just 10 miles from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. There, operating surgeon Dr. Igor Nichiporenko quickly did \"damage control\" on the badly injured teen, who'd been shot in the abdomen, chest, and upper sternum, with tendons \"shattered from gunshot wounds.\" Astonishingly, Wilford was out of the hospital in less than a week. \"Young people have a tendency to heal very fast,\" Nichiporenko says, per the New York Times. \"She's very, very lucky.\" He adds that Ojeda's decision saved Maddy's life. Ojeda is just glad he was there to make the call. \"I thank God for allowing us to be an instrument in this miracle,\" he told CNN Tuesday.

Dutch volleyball star Ingrid Visser and her partner, Lodewijk Severein, went missing shortly after arriving in Murcia, Spain, earlier this month. On Sunday their bodies were found in a lemon grove, buried in a shallow grave. Three suspects were arrested the previous day; among them: Juan Cuenca Lorente, the 36-year-old former director of Murcia's volleyball club, which Visser, a popular Dutch player, played for from 2009 to 2011. Police say Lorente and the couple had some sort of business disagreement, though no specifics were released. As for what Visser, 35, and Severein, 57, were doing in Spain, the BBC reports that they were supposed to see a doctor there on May 14 but never showed up for the appointment; the Telegraph and Dutch News report that they were to undergo fertility treatment."

The reason for the lack of buttons is actually quite simple, according to a post at the Huffington Post UK: The umbilicus, the part of the body that connects the baby's belly to.

Did you throw it in the trash?\" Nowzardan, however, tells KTRK he informed Jones that, because of a preexisting scar, the belly button was going to go. \"We can call Hollywood and get an Oscar nomination for her,\" he says, adding that he can go back in and give Jones a new belly button. But Jones says she has contacted an attorney and wants to settle the issue in court. Her displeasure notwithstanding, Jones is not alone in being belly-button-less. Fashion model Karolina Kurkova, for instance, is lacking a navel because of a surgery she had as an infant, the New York Daily News noted when this odd fact made headlines a few years ago. The BBC also looked into the issue, explaining that in addition to surgery, another factor sometimes at play is a \"lotus birth\"\u2014in which the umbilical cord and placenta are left to drop off on their own.

This is a very real risk, one that Bitcoin enthusiasts don't spend enough time worrying about,\" he writes. \"My own guess is that the bubble\u2019s popping isn\u2019t imminent, and I think that when prices do fall, they\u2019ll land somewhere higher than the $138 I paid for my bitcoins.\" Felix Salmon, New Yorker: \"Like the assets at the center of most powerful asset bubbles, Bitcoin has sound theoretical underpinnings. Importantly, Bitcoin also has a small and (at least theoretically) finite supply.\" Ryan Tate, Forbes: \"Most people today look at Bitcoin and see an impractical curiosity. They're happy with the banking services they've already got and can't imagine why anyone would want to use an alternative.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The price of Bitcoins is skyrocketing at a head-turning rate\u2014they're currently worth more than $200 each, up from $90 when we wrote this piece on the phenomenon two weeks ago\u2014which has everyone wondering: Is this a bubble? And should you buy anyway in the likely event that it is? Here's what people are saying: Farhad Manjoo at Slate gives a first-hand account of the confusing and frankly downright shady process for buying the coins. \"You've got to take several leaps of faith, trusting sites that look like they were put together by teenagers,\" he writes. But that's why he thinks this bubble still has legs. Bubbles, he theorizes, take off when mainstream buyers get involved. Once better Bitcoin sites appear, the masses will arrive, and \"prices will begin to get really crazy.\" Speculators \"are just laughing at all the people who are dismissing Bitcoin as a bubble,\" writes Henry Blodget at Business Insider. Because the most you can lose on Bitcoins is 100% of your money\u2014and you stand to make much more than 100% back. Like, say, 600% (which investors have made in the last six weeks). That said, lots of things could obliterate the market, like hacking, or a government crackdown. Timothy Lee at Forbes thinks Bitcoins are a bonafide disruptive technology. \"The Bitcoin economy today looks a lot like the PC market circa 1978,\" he observes. \"Most people today look at Bitcoin and see an impractical curiosity.\" But Bitcoin isn't a product, it's a platform, and one with lots of room to grow. But Kurt Eichenwald at Vanity Fair is far, far less convinced, calling the system \"very cool. But also very foolish.\" Bitcoins aren't a currency anymore\u2014currencies are based on \"a rational expectation of relatively stable valuation,\" and Bitcoin prices are anything but stable or rational. \"In essence, the market is a fantasy,\" based on speculators and investors. And when they stop buying, who will replace them? \"My bet? No one.\" It's worth noting that the price took a really nasty hit today, falling 24% from its intra-day high of $266."

A notice of intent to recall Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky was filed with the Santa Clara County registrar of voters on Monday, the San Jose Mercury News reports. The recall campaign, led by Stanford law professor Michele Dauber, aims to get 58,634 valid voter signatures within 160 days of the filing of the notice to qualify the measure for the June 2018 countywide ballot. If they're able to get that number, the recall will move on to the formal petition process, which will begin in August, when the signatures will need to be verified by the county registrar. Persky, who was transferred to civil court at his own request last summer, was widely criticized for his lenient sentence in the case of Brock Turner, who received six months in prison after being found guilty of assault with the intent to commit rape of an unconscious person and sexual penetration of an intoxicated person. Proponents say that's too light and that Persky has a \"long history of awarding lenient sentences to athletes and upper-class defendants for sex crimes and violence against women.\" Persky is supported by dozens of law school professors, including 11 who teach at Stanford, who say the recall would set a dangerous precedent. \"Every judge has made an unpopular decision; judicial recalls are an extreme step that should be reserved for,\" they write in a letter to the Mercury News.",

The judge has a \"long pattern of bias in cases involving sex crimes and violence against women in favor of white or privileged defendants, particularly college athletes,\" which came to light after he sentenced Turner to just six months in jail for the sexual assault of an unconscious woman in 2015, the Recall Persky campaign said in a statement. Prosecutors had asked for six years. If campaigners can gather 58,634 voter signatures, the measure to recall Persky will appear on the countywide ballot in June of next year. Recall supporters say it will send a message to the whole country. Persky has already shifted from criminal to civil court, and supporters including District Attorney Jeff Rosen note that the Turner case has led to changes in the law, the San Jose Mercury News reports. \"Judge Persky\u2019s sentence in that case was wrong, in my opinion, but he had the right to give it,\u201d Rosen said in a statement. \"My focus as we move forward is less about an individual judge than it is to the victims of campus sexual assault.\" (A state commission cleared Persky of misconduct last year.)"

The current outbreak is believed to be the result of blooms in algal waters around the reef, which feed the starfish. The authors of the report say there is no way to stop the current outbreak, but they are calling on the government to do more to prevent future ones. \"Current state and national government investment has failed to achieve even modest targets and more money is needed to reduce pollution,\" Holmes says.",

This winter, though, an aquatic robot will be deployed to help slow the invasion of the invertebrates \u2026 by killing them, Scientific American reports. The COTSbot, developed at the Queensland University of Technology, is a small submarine outfitted with cameras, sonar, GPS, and a syringe-tipped arm. Following a pre-programmed path along the reef, the robot scans for crown of thorns starfish. Once it identifies its target, the COTSbot pumps it full of bile salts that, as Scientific American puts it, \"digest the animal from the inside\" before it can separate and regenerate (one starfish can produce millions of young). The COTSbot, which can kill more than 200 starfish in eight hours, will augment the efforts of human divers. \u201cIt's now so good it even ignores our 3D-printed decoys and targets only live starfish,\u201d one researcher says. It is believed the starfish has destroyed some 230 square miles of live coral in the past three decades, per the Times, which says the outbreak may be linked to starfish-nourishing algal blooms resulting from fertilizer runoff. Overfishing of the starfish's predators may also be to blame, per Scientific American. Check out the COTSbot in action in this video."

According to NBC, London police have been unable to uncover any evidence or details of a job interview. \"His dream is to visit the financial area in London,\" Sanchez tells the Guardian. \"That's where he always said he would love to work.\" His father says his son would have little interest in nightlife, as he was more focused on his stocks and making money, and police are currently searching the city's financial areas. ABC News reports Sanchez fears his son is lost somewhere in the city. According to NBC, Sanchez-Maldonado had been speaking to his father every day during his trip. They last spoke the day before he disappeared."

Chait's alleged relationship with the girl started when he was an intern at the Los Angeles Times in the mid-'80s, and he's accused of having sex with her at least a dozen times over the years, including while she was in high school. The girl's mother, however, says Chait never had any sexual relationships with her daughter, and that the alleged affair began when he met the girl and her family for the first time. According to the court documents, Chait, who has been with the Times since the early 1990s, was first questioned by police in connection with the alleged 1982 incident, during which Chait is said to have grabbed the girl by the hair and forced her to perform oral sex on him.

While the police report suggests Brown, who'd been walking with a friend in the street, attacked an officer in his police car and tried to take his gun when the officer told him to use the sidewalk, witnesses say the officer fired after a verbal altercation and that as Brown turned away and fled he was shot once, then at least twice more after he put his hands in the air. Police have not disputed that Brown was unarmed. The police officer who shot him, a six-year veteran of the force, is on paid administrative leave.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations, a civil liberties and advocacy organization, issued a statement early today asking that the NFL take steps in response to the penalty. \"To prevent the appearance of a double standard, we urge league officials to clarify the policy on prayer and recognize that the official made a mistake in this case,\" CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper said.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The NFL is getting quicker with its mea culpas: Amid another growing controversy, the league admitted its mistake today in penalizing a player over a Muslim prayer on the field last night, reports the Kansas City Star. In the game, referees flagged Chiefs player Husain Abdullah, a devout Muslim, after he slid to his knees for a prayer after scoring a touchdown. Immediately, the league began taking flak: If, say, Tim Tebow, can pray in the end zone and not be penalized, why not a Muslim player? Earlier today, the Council on American-Islamic Relations urged the NFL to clarify its rules to \"prevent the appearance of a double-standard,\" reports AP. Hours later, the NFL said the penalty was, in fact, a blown call. While league rules prevent players from celebrating while on the ground, there is an exception: The \"officiating mechanic in this situation is not to flag a player who goes to the ground as part of religious expression, and as a result, there should have been no penalty on the play,\" says an NFL spokesperson. Abdullah, for his part, wasn't making a big deal of it. (The NFL lost a legal fight today with the FCC over game blackouts.)"

Archbishop Charles Chaput issued the new guidelines Friday in response to Pope Francis' Amoris Laetitia, a document on family values issued in April. Chaput says it is a \"hard teaching\" but it is also a \"positive one.\" The guidelines state that Catholics in same-sex partnerships, those remarried without an annulment, and cohabitating couples are not allowed to serve on parish councils, serve as lectors, or dispense Communion. \"No matter how sincere,\" it would \"offer a serious counter-witness to Catholic belief, which can only produce moral confusion in the community,\" the Inquirer quotes Chaput as saying. The pope is \"clearly open to the possibility of divorced and remarried Catholics receiving Holy Communion,\" a National Catholic Reporter columnist tells the Inquirer, \"but I think he'd also leave this to the discretion of the local bishop, which means that Chaput can do what he wants in his diocese, but a neighboring bishop may take a much more open position.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It just got a whole lot less fun to be a Catholic in Philadelphia. New guidelines released by Archbishop Charles Chaput last Friday say divorced couples who have remarried must permanently abstain from sex, instead living like \"brother and sister,\" the Guardian reports. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, there are about 4.5 million US Catholics who have been remarried without getting their first marriage annulled by the church. But divorcees aren't the only ones Chaput wants to see living without sex. People in same-sex relationships and straight couples who aren't married must also go sexless. Fortunately, the new guidelines explain that anyone can be in a successful heterosexual marriage with kids even with \"some degree of same-sex attraction.\" The guidelines, which come from one of the most conservative Catholic leaders in the US, also recommend priests try to break up couples who aren't interested in getting married, which shows they're \"lacking in maturity,\" and claims same-sex relationships will \"produce moral confusion in the community.\" Anyone going against the guidelines should not receive Holy Communion and should be barred from positions of responsibility within the church. The six pages of guidelines are a direct response to Pope Francis' Joy of Love document, which many saw as instructing bishops to be more accepting of \"irregular\" relationships. But one official with the Philadelphia archdiocese says that document \"may not have been as well expressed as it should have been.\" Chaput's guidelines are meant to clarify it."

Team leader Marcello Canuto sees the dynasty rising up with a mix of cultural appropriation, like conjuring old gods on the tablet to gain legitimacy; marriage, with a princess from neighboring Mexico; and other alliances with powerful forces. Otherwise, beating Tikal \"would be the equivalent to Cuba defeating the United States in a war,\" says Canuto. \"They could only have done that ... if they had had the backing of the Soviet Union.\" Announced Wednesday, the altar is on display at the National Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology in Guatemala City, per the Times-Picayune."

The Census Bureau released a population report Wednesday that looks back at the 18-34 demographic over the past four decades, comparing today's young adults to those going back to 1975. \"If one theme describes how adulthood has changed over the last 40 years, it is growing complexity,\" the report notes.

Per the Miami Herald, millennials seem to look more highly upon a good education than their predecessors, with 37% boasting at least a bachelor's degree in 2016, compared with 23% in 1975. The extra schooling likely explains a drop homeownership among millennials, from 52% in 1975 to 29% today. You won't find millennials starting families as soon as they're done with that schooling, and women especially aren't as eager to be relegated to homemaker roles as past generations, NBC Washington reports.

A month before that report, she had complained to police that Lane was stalking her and left a note on her new boyfriend's car saying, \"Shana will always cheat on you.\" Lane is now on trial for the murder.

More: If the NBA hadn't chucked Sterling, the game would never have happened, because both teams had planned to walk off the court in protest moments before it was supposed to begin, Sports Illustrated reveals. \"It was a real option,\" says Warriors coach Mark Jackson. V. Stiviano, the woman Sterling was recorded making racist remarks to, is \"saddened\" by the owner's lifetime ban and is \"devastated\" that the recording was released, her lawyer tells the Los Angeles Times. He says that his client wasn't Sterling's girlfriend and never had a romantic relationship with him. The lawyer says she was hired as an \"archivist\"\u2014an archivist who received $1.8 million in gifts from Sterling, according to a lawsuit filed by his wife of more than 50 years. What now for Sterling? NBA Commissioner Adam Silver plans to push him to sell the team, and fellow team owners appear willing to follow the recommendation to force him out. He could fight back in the courts, but his chances of success are \"basically zero,\" a CNN legal analyst says. If he does sell, it will be for a huge profit: He bought the team for $12 million in 1981 and it is now valued at $575 million, though some experts believe it could sell for closer to $1 billion."

Two tombs carry Garrincha's name: the original grave where he was laid to rest in 1983, and a second one constructed in 1985 and marked with an obelisk. If the family agrees, Mage Mayor Rafael Tubarao says he'll order an exhumation of the graves and DNA tests of any bones. Garrincha, a nickname meaning \"little wren\" in Brazil's Portuguese dialect, is widely revered as the nation's greatest dribbler of all time.

The page notes that Oakleigh's left kidney is actually two, and she'll need to have one of them removed in order to prevent her kidneys from becoming infected with the antibiotic-resistant strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. \"We are so thankful for all the prayers and support we have received,\" writes her mother on the GoFundMe page. \"Oakleigh has a long road ahead of her.\"",

The bird, which lived around the time of the extinction event that wiped out most of Earth's dinosaurs, had feathers about the size of sesame seeds and were more than twice as long as those of modern birds, the BBC reports. \"This is the first time that feathers have been seen on a non-avian theropod,\" the study's lead author says. The fossil of the Caihong juji was found in a cave in southern China, and researchers report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that the bird's iridescent blue-and-black coloration is likely the result of an ancient pigment called melanosomes. These pigment-like structures are present in birds today, including hummingbirds and swifts, but they're also found in penguins and birds of the genus Anchiornis, reports the New York Times. \"It's kind of mind-blowing to see these feathers ... on a dinosaur,\" says a co-author of the study. \"They're longer on both sides of the body.\" Caihong, meaning \"lion of the sky\" in Chinese, is a member of a group of dinosaur relatives known as flighted avialans, which also include oviraptors and dromaeosaurids, which include the triceratops and the dinosaur that gave us our first glimpse of the dinosaur's nose.",

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes\u2014similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

The pilot left the cockpit for the toilet shortly before 10:30am local time and returned a few minutes later, but he couldn't get back in and was heard trying again and again to get into the cockpit before the plane went down, reports the AP. After several more minutes, the pilot could be heard trying to break open the doors. The report in Bild am Sonntag is based on a transcript from the cockpit voice recorder, but France's accident investigation agency, BEA, says it's \"dismayed\" by the leak, which could not have come from a BEA agent. A spokeswoman says the report is mere \"voyeurism.\" The New York Times, meanwhile, reports that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz sought treatment for an unspecified vision problem before the crash, but an official with Lufthansa, Lubitz's employer, says the vision problems could have been psychosomatic and that Lubitz did not seek treatment for them.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Investigators carrying out the grim task of recovering wreckage and human remains from the Germanwings crash say they have not found an intact body\u2014or the flight data recorder. To aid the search, an access road is being built to the remote site in the French Alps, where forensic teams have so far recovered DNA belonging to 78 of the 150 people killed, the Guardian reports. Investigators say that so far, only the empty protective casing of the black box has been found. In other developments: Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz is believed to have deliberately crashed the plane, but with the failure to find the flight's second black box, some in the aviation world are saying it is too early to rule out other causes. Airbus chairman Tom Enders slammed TV coverage of the crash in an interview published yesterday, Deutsche Welle reports. \"Sometimes people there speculate, fantasize, and lie with no basis in fact,\" he said, calling some of the reporting \"outrageous nonsense\" that was a \"mockery of the victims.\" The cockpit voice recorder was recovered soon after the crash, and German newspaper Bild has published what it says is a leaked transcript. Capt. Patrick Sondenheimer (also spelled Sonderheimer or Sondheimer, depending on the source) can be heard pleading for Lubitz to let him back in the cabin, shouting, \"Open the goddamn door!\" as passengers scream minutes before impact, according to the transcript. A spokeswoman for France's accident investigation agency tells CNN that investigators are \"dismayed\" by the leak. Over the weekend, there were reports that Lubitz suffered from a psychomatic illness that may have been linked to a vision problem. German newspapers, including Bild, also reported that Lubitz's girlfriend, a teacher, was pregnant and the couple had planned to marry, according to the Independent. In Lubitz's hometown of Montabaur, the local Lutheran pastor tells the AP that despite mounting evidence that Lubitz caused the crash, he was still part of the community and the church is standing by his family. He says Lubitz's mother is a part-time organist for the church and he knew the co-pilot as a teenager. \"This does not make sense. It is incomprehensible for me, for us, for everyone who knew her and the family,\" he says."

The bill was put to a vote last week, but the opposition used the filibuster to delay it and prevent it from passing. The ruling Saenuri Party controls 157 seats in the 293-member National Assembly, meaning the bill is very likely to be passed. \"Everyone participated with enthusiasm,\" Lee Jong-kul, the party's floor leader, said, reiterating that the bill infringes upon the privacy rights of the citizens. A total of 49 lawmakers took turns speaking around the clock in opposition to the bills, claiming it would give too much power to the intelligence agency.

The last speaker alone spoke for 12 hours and 31 minutes to claim the record for longest individual filibuster in South Korea. Speakers wore running shoes, thumbed through huge stacks of documents, read academic articles and online comments on privacy infringement in their entirety, and recited sections of George Orwell's 1984, per Yonhap News. It was unsurprising, then, that the parliament chair was caught sleeping. The lawmakers argued the anti-terror bill\u2014allowing for the collection of data, including phone records, on people considered security risks\u2014would violate privacy rights, but President Park Geun-hye said the filibuster was \"nothing more than a dereliction of duty.\" The public was also peeved that the stunt held up bills regarding North Korean human rights and an upcoming election."

All that activity can lead to dreamed situations that feel very real\u2014in some cases, even religious. In a new paper in Frontiers in Psychology, a neurologist and theological scholar argue that dreams are well-suited to create experiences in which we believe we've spoken to a deity of some kind. That is in part due to the feeling of an alternative reality we get in dreams, the researchers say. What's more, in dreams, we often ascribe emotions and thoughts to those we believe we're encountering. We give them an \"exaggerated degree of agency\" because our dreaming brains have trouble understanding our thoughts as our own, the researchers write. The researchers also note that unclear boundaries between REM sleep and wakefulness can be linked to schizophrenia\u2014but at Gizmodo, Annalee Newitz notes that the feeling of \"hearing voices\" may not necessarily mean a person is dealing with mental illness. A recent survey found that 15% of respondents who say they've heard voices have no diagnosis of disorder, and the \"hearing\" involved isn't necessarily auditory; the voices may not feel as though they're external at all, researchers say.

The Seattle City Council voted 7-2 Tuesday to scrap the tax, which would have charged companies $275 per full-time worker each year, the AP reports. The measure had passed earlier this year, but businesses opposed to the tax raised more than $280,000 to fight it in a referendum before it was repealed. \"Proponents of engaging in a prolonged, expensive political fight, the City and I will continue to move forward on building real partnerships that align our strategies from business, advocates, philanthropy,\" Mayor Jenny Durkan said in a statement, per the Seattle Times. Durkan had called for the tax to be repealed after Amazon halted planning for two tower projects in response to the measure. The tax would have collected about $275 per head on employees at businesses with more than $20 million in annual revenue, raising roughly $48 million a year for housing and other services for the city's booming homeless population.

This: \"We have reached the conclusion that this is not a winnable battle at this time.\" That was the pronouncement of Seattle Councilwoman Lisa Herbold Tuesday in advance of what ended up being a 7-2 vote to reverse a new tax the council had unanimously approved only a month prior. The so-called \"head tax\" would have generated just shy of $50 million annually to put toward homelessness and affordable housing by charging businesses that generate more than $20 million in revenue a year about $275 per employee. That would have hit about 3% of businesses in the city, one of which is Amazon, which would have contributed about 25% of the expected total, reports NPR. The company was vocal in its opposition. And per SeattlePI.com, the \"stunning wealth\" of Amazon, Starbucks, and the rest of the opposition drove the reversal. As Councilwoman Lorena Gonzalez explains, \"I have been unable to find a way forward that we could out-fund and out-resource the opposition campaign by November\" (the opposition was campaigning for a referendum on the tax in the fall). \"Money has funded this campaign that put us in a position where we have to repeal this law.\" The AP characterizes city leaders as having \"underestimated the frustration\" over not just the tax but the fact that while $68 million was spent on homelessness last year, a January count found the homeless population in the Seattle area up 4%, to 12,000, suggesting to some that the city's current resources weren't being used appropriately."

The study looked at 135 vaulters from 15 universities over a single track-and-field season and found that 41% suffered an injury during their event. The most common injury was to the low back, with the hamstrings and lower leg coming in second and third, respectively, per a press release. Back injuries were the most common type of injury, with 60% of them occurring during the vaulting phase. The risk of injury was 2.7 times higher for vaulters with multiple injuries, and the risk was even higher for those who landed on their body on the landing pad and their head on the ground instead of in the vault box. Researchers recommend that the minimum landing pad size be increased to 16 inches, and that the rule requiring soft surfaces next to the landing pads be enforced. For more, click here.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 If the words \"pole vaulting\" don't inspire fear in you, they should. That's the upshot of a Vice article about the sport, which succinctly expresses why: \"At 20 feet, a pole vault accident is like someone falling off the roof of their house, while running as fast at they can with a thick pole in their hands.\" If that sounds like a brush with death, it quite literally can be: A 2001 study analyzed the 32 catastrophic pole-vault injuries that were reported to the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research between 1982 and 1998; half the accidents resulted in death, and 6 in permanent disabilities. A follow-up study published in 2012 noted that one safety-related change made in 2003 was an expansion of the landing pad's minimum dimensions. In the 8 years that followed, the study noted only two of the 19 catastrophic injuries were fatal. But the rest weren't pretty: major head injuries and spine or pelvic fractures were among them. And a study of collegiate pole vaulters published this last January found 41% sustained some kind of injury, a figure that researchers saw as suggestive of the fact that \"injuries are very common in experienced vaulters.\" The injury stats aren't good, and the potential pay and fame aren't much better. So why the heck do it? Vice talked to US record-holder Brad Walker (one of 18 men to ever clear 6 meters), who sums up vaulters as \"risk-takers, usually with something to prove to themselves ... you won't find a vaulter jumping high who doesn't have at least one screw loose.\" As for why they stay with it, Vice points to its highly technical and challenging nature: As you approach the box you're a sprinter; then you're a gymnast. Walker says you need \"significant body control and spatial awareness,\" too."

For men, the risk was 23% lower. The study did not prove chocolate causes atrial fibrillation or that chocolate is the culprit, but researchers suggest that chocolate has more cocoa content and that compounds in chocolate called flavonoids may help prevent the heart's electrical remodeling that leads to atrial fibrillation. \"As part of a healthy diet, moderate intake of chocolate is a healthy snack choice,\" says the lead author, per Reuters.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Willy Wonka may have been on to something. Regularly eating chocolate could possibly help prevent a type of irregular heartbeat that can increase the risk of heart failure, strokes, and cognitive impairment, according to a study published Tuesday in Heart. Live Science reports between 2.7 million and 6.1 million Americans have atrial fibrillation, in which the upper chambers of the heart beat at a different pace than the lower chambers. But a study of 55,000 adults in Denmark found that those who ate chocolate at least once a month had rates of atrial fibrillation 10% to 20% lower than those who ate it less than once a month. The best results came from eating an ounce of chocolate two to six times per week. It's impossible to say based on the study whether chocolate consumption was directly responsible for lower rates of atrial fibrillation. Researchers also aren't clear how chocolate could even affect the development of the condition, but it may have something to do with things called flavanols, the Los Angeles Times reports. Atrial fibrillation is thought to be caused by molecules damaging heart tissue. The flavanols in chocolate can stop inflammation that leads to tissue damage. \"As part of a healthy diet, moderate intake of chocolate is a healthy snack choice,\" Reuters quotes the study's lead author as saying. Though it's important to choose chocolate with a higher cocoa content. (And you should probably also take it easy on the ibuprofen.)"

It's possible the traffic could be caused by law enforcement groups conducting investigations or hackers flooding the sites with fake visits. And then there's the positive justification for an anonymous web. \"There are important uses for hidden services, such as when human rights activists use them to access Facebook or to blog anonymously,\" says Tor's executive director.

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Feel younger than your chronological age? You may have a lower death rate, according to a new study published in JAMA Internal Medicine. \"Self-perceived age reflects appraisals of health, physical limitations, and well-being in later life,\" write the authors of the study, from University College London in the UK. \"Older people typically feel younger than their chronological age, and it is thought that those who feel Younger than their actual age have reduced mortality.\" To study this, the researchers analyzed data from more than 6,000 participants who answered the question, \"How old do you feel you are?\" The average age of the participants was 65.8 years, with an average self-Perceived Age of 56.8 years. They were divided into three groups: those who felt more than a year older than their real age (4.8%), people who felt 3 or more years younger (69.6%), and participants who felt closer to their actual ages (25.6%), Medical News Today reports. They found that the mortality rate was 14.3% among adults who felt Younger than Their Actual Age, with a mortality rate of 18.% among participants with a Self- Perceived Ages Close to Their Actual Ages, and 24.6% among participants who Feeled Older than Their actual Ages. The researchers believe this could be because they felt empowered to make their own decisions and because they followed medical advice. \"Individuals who feel Older than their Actual Age could be targeted with health messages promoting positive health behaviors and attitudes toward aging,\" the study's authors say.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 If you eat well and exercise, you'll probably feel younger than your chronological age. But new research suggests that simply feeling younger than your age\u2014even when accounting for other longevity factors, such as alcohol intake, wealth, illness, education, and smoking\u2014improves longevity, reports Medical News Today. Studying 6,489 participants in the English Longitudinal Study of Aging, researchers report in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine that mortality was only 14.3% among those who felt younger than their age, but was 18% for those who felt their age, and 24.6% for those who felt older. \"Someone who feels younger is possibly healthier than someone who feels older\u2014they have fewer diseases, they may be more mobile,\" a researcher tells CBS Philadelphia. The study couldn't connect self-perceived age with death by cancer, but did establish a strong link between self-perceived age and fatal cardiovascular disease. Factors that speed up self-perceived aging include becoming a parent at an early age, experiencing stress, and developing serious health problems such as cancer. Still, more than 66% of participants say they felt at least three years younger than their chronological age. According to the study, older people who feel old may well slow the aging process by adopting a fresh outlook: \"Interventions may be possible,\" the authors say. \"Individuals who feel older than their actual age could be targeted with health messages promoting positive health behaviors and attitudes toward aging.\" (Other research suggests soda can age our cells as much as cigarettes.)"

With that in mind, Tiffany notes such adverse effects could continue in Q4 and beyond."

The offer was made in papers filed this week in California Superior Court in San Francisco. The firm said the case, which drew an abundance of unfavorable attention to its inner workings and the fate of women in Silicon Valley, cost it $972,815 in witness fees, deposition, and court reporter costs. As the winning party, Kleiner is asking the former associate, Ellen Pao, to reimburse it for these bills. But if she forgoes any appeal and lets the case die, the firm will forgive and forget, or at least move on. \"We believe that women in technology would be best served by having all parties focus on making progress on the issues of gender diversity outside of continued litigation,\" a Kleiner spokeswoman said in a statement.

Pao's attorneys say they will have a decision in a few weeks. Kleiner Perkins says it offered Pao about $1 million as a settlement before the trial began, but received no response from her legal team. Because of that offer, the company can now go after Pao for expensive witness fees, explains the New York Times. One factor that will surely weigh on the decision: A review of previous cases suggests that Pao has only a slim chance of winning on appeal, reports Reuters."

But with the discovery of the fossil of Kulindadromeus zabaikalicus, \"the fact that feathers have now been discovered in two distinct groups ... suggests that featherlike structures coexisted with scales and were potentially widespread among the entire dinosaur clade; feathers may thus have been present in the earliest dinosaurs.\" The creature, which roamed what is now southern Russia, was about 2 feet long and had a short snout, long hind legs, short arms, and five strong fingers, reports the New York Times. \"It was a big surprise,\" the researcher says. \"Instead of scaly, scary creatures a lot of them actually had a fluffy, down.\"",

The latest fossils, however, come from a two-legged dinosaur in the ornithischian group, which National Geographic says accounts for about half of all dinosaurs. \"Probably that means the common ancestor of all dinosaurs had feathers,\" the study author says. The fossils have \"completely changed our vision of dinosaurs,\" he adds, per the BBC. A paleontologist not involved with the study calls it \"fantastic\" and says it revealed three types of feather imprints different from those of other feathered dinosaurs as well as those of modern birds: \"I don't know\" why they had feathers, he says. \"These animals couldn't fly, that's all we can tell you.\" (Read about a dinosaur that did fly\u2014with four wings.)"
