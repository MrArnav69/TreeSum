I think it could be done in an afternoon by an undergraduate student,\" she tells the Boston Globe. King's argument is that the eight-line fragment appears to have been copied from a much earlier Greek text, perhaps composed in the second century, and that the forger may have \"wanted to put his or her own spin on modern theological issues,\" such as the role of women and celibacy in Christianity. King pored over the original carbon-dating and ink testing done on the ancient papyrus and concluded that \"such a combination of bumbling and sophistication seems extremely unlikely. I haven\u2019t seen any argument that I find at all compelling that would indicate that it\u2019s not genuine,\" says the director of New York University's Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, one of the world's top papyrologists.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 To call it controversial is putting it mildly: Harvard professor Karen L. King in September 2012 debuted an ancient papyrus now known as the \"Gospel of Jesus' Wife\" at a conference in Rome. The papyrus makes an explicit reference to the woman's existence with the line, \"Jesus said to them, 'My wife...'\" Now, extensive testing by professors from Columbia, Harvard, and MIT in the fields of electrical engineering, chemistry, and biology has found no indications that it is a modern forgery, per an article by King published today in the Harvard Theological Review. The Boston Globe says it most likely dates to eighth-century Egypt, and the chemical composition of its ink is in line with the carbon-based inks the people of that country used at the time. But the Globe cautions that a master forger could have accessed the proper materials, and that traditional ink-dating methods couldn't be used because the papyrus is so small: a fragment roughly 1.5-by-3 inches in size bearing just eight incomplete lines (translation here). The Review also published a rebuttal by Brown Egyptology professor Leo Depuydt, who points to \"gross grammatical errors\" he says no native speaker of Coptic would make, the New York Times reports. (More criticism of the papyrus here.) The new findings certainly don't prove that Jesus was married, a point that King has never challenged; she'd like to see the debate shift to discussions of the document's significance, and \"questions like, 'Why does Jesus being married, or not, even matter?'\" King was in 2011 asked to review the fragment at the request of its anonymous owner, who says he bought it more than a decade earlier from a collector who said he purchased it, along with five others, in East Germany in the '60s."

Alter even talked to a rabbi who said celebrating was \"not in itself a transgressive act,\" for Jews, as long as they're not celebrating Christ as the Messiah. That's good, because 32% of Jews have a Christmas tree, a recent Pew survey revealed. Christmas has become a secular American holiday, like Thanksgiving or the Fourth of July. That's true even for religious Jews like Dennis Prager at RealClearPolitics, whose Orthodox family nonetheless watched the Vatican's mass every year. \"The notion that non-Christians are excluded is absurd,\" he argues; those who argue otherwise are, in his mind, secular liberals trying to divide America. \"The entire society\u2014Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, atheists as well as Christians\u2014all benefit from the goodness and joy that the Christmas season engenders.\" Click for Alter's full column, or here for Prager's."

Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake imposed a one-week curfew but stressed the need to respond in a way that did not incite more violence.

According to FBI data, more than 39,000 people were arrested for prostitution and related charges in 2016. It is believed that 80% of women arrested on prostitution charges are either under the control of a third party or have been trafficked at some point. The investigation found cases of the bond system being used in sex trafficking operations in at least five states. Pimps and sex buyers are locating incarcerated women awaiting a court date by using personal data such as mugshots and bail bonds posted online, or through corrupt bondsmen. Traffickers are then bailing women out of detention. Once released, the women are told they must work as prostitutes or have their bond rescinded and be sent back to jail.",

For the women already in prison, the traffickers use letters and calls to reel them in. In a companion piece, the Guardian shares Kate's story: While incarcerated at Florida's Lowell Correctional Institution, a stranger named Richard Rawls began to write to her, saying he saw her mugshot online and that it stuck with him. He knew she'd be out soon. He told her to \"come on home to your daddy,\" that he would provide a comfortable home and all the love she needed. Instead, she was taken to a roach-infested house guarded by pit bulls; inside were other former inmates from the same prison. Rawls fed her drugs then demanded she pay him back for them by working as a prostitute. Four months later, she was freed by a SWAT team. Read the full investigation here, or more on Rawls here."

Titus is already suffering the effects. \"When we got the diagnosis, [Titus] was still talking, walking and eating,\" Bekah says. \"Within a month ... he lost all of those abilities. He's blind, he cannot walk anymore, he's in a wheelchair, he's eating through a GJ tube and he doesn't talk anymore.\" Still, the Bowmans are finding a way to be thankful for every day they have with their boys.

The woman is OK, save for some bruises and scratches on her arms, and Benes faces a slew of charges, including battery on a person 65 or older and false imprisonment. The Smoking Gun has a copy of the complaint affidavit, though it doesn't explain why Benes thought an exorcism was necessary.

That's a CEO to worker pay ratio of 3,101 to one, according to a new report from the Economic Policy Institute. The ratio peaked in 2000 when CEOs earned 344 times the average worker's wage, the Guardian reports. The pay gap has been rising rapidly since 2009, according to the EPI, which found that CEO pay has increased by 979% between 1978 and 2017. \"Over time I think there has been a loosening of norms,\" Lawrence Mishel, an EPI senior fellow, tells Business Insider. Forbes has released its list of the highest-paid CEOs in the US, and it includes an eye-popping one for Amazon's Jeff Bezos. The 59-year-old CEO raked in a salary of $15.5 million last year, with the rest of his compensation coming in the form of stock options. The rest of the top five, per Forbes: Jeff Bezos, Amazon, $15.3 million Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook, $10.7 million",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 For every dollar made by the average Facebook employee, Mark Zuckerberg earned $37 in 2017. As far as CEO pay goes, that's nothing. The CEOs of America's top 350 publicly held companies earned an average of $18.9 million in wages, bonuses, and stock options last year, or 312 times more than their workers, according to a report by the Economic Policy Institute. Per the Guardian, such an \"astronomical gap\" hasn't been seen since the eve of the 2007 financial crisis. The 17.6% increase in average CEO pay, compared to 0.3% for workers, had a lot to do with a booming stock market, but it's also part of a larger trend. Since 2009, average CEO pay has risen 72%, compared to about 2% for workers, who now make $54,600 on average. \"It speaks to the degree the economic recovery is unbalanced,\" report co-author Larry Mishel tells the Washington Post, which describes CEO-to-worker pay ratios of 3,101-to-1 for McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook and 1,188-to-1 for Walmart CEO Doug McMillon. \"Had there not been the redistribution upward \u2026 the wages of the bottom 90% could have grown twice as fast as it actually did,\" Mishel tells the Guardian. Per the Post, 2018 figures could be even worse for workers given the tax package signed into law last fall; critics say it will make the rich richer, though Republican backers claim it will increase wages across the board."

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Dave Mirra, the action-sports star who killed himself in February, had a degenerative brain disease similar to that found in the brains of football and hockey players, multiple neuropathologists say. University of Toronto neuropathologist Lili-Naz Hazrati, who oversaw the examination of the 41-year-old's brain, says he is the first action sports athlete to be diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. \"I couldn't tell the difference,\" Hazrati tells ESPN. \"The trauma itself defines the disease, not how you got the trauma.\" The tau protein deposits found in Mirra's brains are indistinguishable from those found in NFL and NHL players with CTE, Hazrati says. \"It's assumed it is related to multiple concussions that happened years before,\" she adds. Mirra, a seven-time X Games champion and creator of X Games Fox, was found dead in his truck in his North Carolina home by a friend who had been unable to reach him. The cause of death hasn't been released, but an autopsy found that he had suffered from CTE, the Washington Post reports. His family has set up a fund in his name to fund research into CTE and other brain diseases. \"We ask for your continued support in honoring Dave's legacy and for your patience as we plan to create a platform for CTE awareness and research,\" the family says.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Dave Mirra, the legendary BMX star who killed himself in February, had chronic traumatic encephalopathy\u2014a disease more commonly seen in football players and boxers, ESPN reports. He's believed to be the first action sports athlete to be diagnosed with it. \"The key is brain injury,\" says the neuropathologist who diagnosed Mirra. \"Regardless of how you get it, through BMX or hockey, you are at risk for this.\" Mirra suffered numerous concussions throughout his BMX career. He once described a 2006 crash to the Washington Post by saying, \u201cI basically fell 16 feet straight to my head.\u201d \u201cThis is a young man that had a pretty rugged sports career and took a lot of injuries,\" USA Today quotes a friend as saying. Mirra's diagnosis of CTE was confirmed by multiple neuropathologists, though it's unclear what stage the disease was in. Scans of Mirra's brain showed the same tau protein deposits as those in the brains of former football players. CTE, which is only able to be diagnosed after death, can cause depression, dementia, and memory loss. Mirra's wife Lauren says Mirra underwent major mood and personality changes in the year before he killed himself at 41. \u201cWe ask for your continued support in honoring Dave\u2019s legacy and for your patience as we plan to create a platform for CTE awareness and research,\" reads a statement from Lauren, per USA Today. Mirra, who \"was the face of his sport,\" will be inducted into the National BMX Hall of Fame next month.

Several hundred Pacific walruses began amassing on an island off Alaska\u2019s northwest coast in the first week of August in what wildlife officials say is the earliest date yet for their annual \"haulout.\" The culprit appears to be shrinking Arctic ice. Walruses tend to head ashore two weeks after warm temperatures cause sea ice to recede too far north for them in the Chukchi Sea. This year, it happened earlier than ever. Walruses typically use sea ice for protection and as a home base, particularly for juveniles, while adults dive to the ocean floor for food. But \"when that ice retreats to the deeper water, they can't do that,\" Fish and Wildlife rep Andrea Medeiros tells Alaska Public Media. For the past several years, a barrier island near Point Lay has served as an alternative home base. Last year, thousands of walruses had arrived there by Oct. 7. This year, however, the haulout was observed beginning on Aug. 3\u2014a full two weeks ahead of the next earliest date observed back in 2011, reports Alaska Dispatch News. Medeiros tells the AP that last week some 2,000 walruses were observed on the island, where they're expected to stay until the fall. Hoping to head north to observe the animals? Officials would rather you not. Not only is it illegal to disturb them, the walruses are known to stampede to the water in response to plane and boat activity in the area, which spells bad news for juvenile walruses."

Nearly 400 cops and other rescuers\u2014as well as drones and search dogs, per Channel NewsAsia\u2014were deployed to find Yoshiki, who doctors feared would succumb to dehydration and Japan's summer heat. Being credited with Yoshiki's discovery: 78-year-old volunteer Haruo Obata, who correctly guessed the boy was more likely to have climbed up the mountain rather than down it. Obata tells the Shimbun that as he called the boy's name around 6:30am Wednesday, he heard an \"I'm here\" and found the child, who \"snatched a bag of candy\" from Obata's hands as he held it out to him. Yoshiki was found to be dehydrated, with tick bites and scratches, but otherwise fine. \"I'm so grateful my son returned safely,\" Yoshiki's mother told local TV. The boy's grandfather tells the Morning Post, \"I apologize, as it was I who took my eyes off him.\""

Trump announced the move Thursday, saying Israel had \"proved its power\" after years of \"unprovoked attacks\" on the city. The White House said Friday that Trump had signed a bill into law making the city the capital of Israel, the first time such a change has been made under a president who has called the city a \"shithole.\" Trump said Thursday that he had decided to make Jerusalem the capital because the city \"has been failing for a long time\" and he wanted to make it \"a great place to live and work.\" The move angered Palestinians, who called it a \"gross violation\" of international law. In a follow-up tweet, Trump noted that \"the budgetbusting pages\" are for his proposed border wall, which he says will be paid for with cuts elsewhere in the budget. \"This is the Democrats' plan to make America great again,\" he wrote. \"They want to give big tax breaks to the wealthy and give away vast amounts of money to the poor.

Senate passage shortly after midnight averted a third federal shutdown this year, an outcome both parties wanted to avoid. But in crafting a sweeping deal that busts budget caps, they've stirred conservative opposition and set the contours for the next funding fight ahead of the midterm elections, the AP reports. \"Shame, shame. A pox on both Houses\u2014and parties,\" tweeted Sen. Rand Paul. \"No one has read it,\" he added of the 2,200-page bill that was released the night before. \"Congress is broken.\" The House easily approved the measure Thursday, 256-167, a bipartisan tally that underscored the popularity of the compromise, which funds the government through September. It beefs up military and domestic programs, delivering federal funds to every corner of the country. But action stalled in the Senate as conservatives ran the clock in protest. Then, an unusual glitch arose when Sen. James Risch, an Idaho Republican, wanted to remove a provision to rename a forest in his home state after the late Cecil Andrus, a four-term Democratic governor. Once the opponents relented, the Senate began voting, clearing the package by a 65-32 vote a full day before Friday's midnight deadline to fund the government.

Prior to starting this leg on a trip around the world, the Impulse 2 had flown about 5,000 miles. Co-pilot Bertrand Piccard is next set to fly the plane from Hawaii to Phoenix before the plane eventually arrives on the eastern seaboard. The Impulse 2 will then attempt an Atlantic crossing, though any further delays could seriously hamper the trip. The team optimally needs to traverse that ocean before the peak of hurricane season in August. The plane had been scheduled to take off from Japan last week, but had to cancel at the last moment due to weather. (Discover how Borschberg will cope during the lengthy Pacific flight.)"

The PBS series Super Cats follows them on nightly forays, showing how they hunt and explaining why they kill more prey in a night than a leopard does in half a year. German zoo curator Luke Hunter helped by fitting several black-footed cats with radio collars, enabling the crew to track them in tall grasses. \"If you're a gazelle or a wildebeest, a black-footed cat isn't at all deadly,\" says Hunter, who has studied the cats since the 1990s. \"But those success rates make them the deadliest little cat on Earth.\" And the black-footed cat has tricks. It can hunt by bounding randomly through grass, sneaking up on prey in a weaving pattern, or waiting patiently by burrows for a meal to emerge. They can \"wait for up to 2 hours, absolutely immobile, just silently waiting at the burrow for a rodent to appear,\" Hunter says. \"And then they nab it.\" They kill 10 to 14 small birds and rodents nightly, or about one every 50 minutes\u2014a constant hunt necessary to supply their active metabolisms. Like most felines in the series, the black-footed cat is endangered, but Hunter accentuates the positive: \"I believe it's mostly not doom and gloom,\" he says, but \"if we don't work to reduce those threats, then we could lose some of these animals.\" See the episode at PBS.

A nine-person committee set up to oversee the surveillance would have only an advisory role and could not overrule the prime minister. The measure \"shows a number of tactics that seem cribbed from the NSA, including bulk collection of internet metadata, which would allow the government to track French citizens from site to site,\" notes a post at the Verge. The legislation also allows intelligence services to put microphones in a room or on objects to record conversations, and to use other devices to intercept phone conversations and text messages.

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 The Zika virus may be behind a spike in microcephaly and other birth defects in Brazil, according to a study published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. Researchers found the virus in the brain of an aborted fetus of a European woman who became pregnant while living in Brazil. An autopsy of the fetus showed microcephaly or small head size, as well as severe brain injury and high levels of the Zika virus in fetal brain tissues, exceeding levels typically found in blood samples, Reuters reports. The findings help \"strengthen the biologic association\" between Zika virus infection and microcephaly, researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston wrote in an editorial accompanying the study. The CDC released full results of its own research Wednesday that found Zika in the brains of two newborns who died shortly after birth and two miscarriages, NBC News reports. \"This is the critical point,\" the director of the Center for Emerging Viruses and Infectious Diseases at Johns Hopkins tells the New York Times. \"You have a mother who's infected, a fetus that's abnormal, and in the fetal, you have the genetic signature of the virus.\" Meanwhile, researchers published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association's JAMA Ophthalmology found eye defects in more than a third of pregnancies in Brazil linked to Zika.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The Zika virus' apparent effect on fetuses is on shocking display in a new study in the New England Journal of Medicine that was rushed to publication given the virus' spread. Though it offers no definitive link between Zika and fetal abnormalities, the study does produce the first evidence of virus transmission from mother to child and \"the strongest evidence yet that the virus causes abnormally small heads and incomplete brain development,\" reports the Verge. The study centers on a 25-year-old Slovenian woman who became pregnant while volunteering in Brazil in February 2015. She developed a high fever and rash during her 13th week of pregnancy, but ultrasounds at 14 and 20 weeks showed no issues. When she returned to Slovenia in October, however, doctors found extensive brain damage in the fetus and the pregnancy was aborted, per NBC News. An autopsy found the full genome of the Zika virus exclusively in the fetus' unusually smooth and scarred brain, suggesting the virus only attacked nerve tissue, per Reuters. The mother had no family history of genetic abnormalities and the fetus tested negative for 13 other viruses known to cause birth defects. \"You have a mother who's infected, a fetus that's abnormal, and in the fetus, you have the genetic signature of the virus,\" says an infectious disease expert. \"This is clear data showing Zika can infect the fetus.\" An epidemiologist adds \"it sounds like a pretty clear case of extreme microcephaly.\" Scientists suspect brain development may have stopped around 20 weeks, leading one doctor to suggest that Zika, like other viruses linked to birth defects, may be most dangerous in the early stages of pregnancy.

Walker, who is just seven months into his term, had made expanding Medicaid a campaign priority. \"This is the final option for me,\" he says.

Pete Kelly. \"Our current system is broken.\" Walker hopes to begin enrollment in September and have 20,000 signed up within one year.

Instead of \"when they fall in love,\" it should be \"when he falls in love,\" or perhaps the clunkier \"when he or she falls in love,\" right? That has long been the prevailing view, but after a slow and steady creep, that view seems to be disappearing. In fact, this year might be the tipping point for acceptance of the \"singular they.\" Quartz, for example, has dubbed singular they its Word of the Year. And earlier this month, the Washington Post changed its style guide to accept it, though the guide still encourages reporters to first try to write around it by recasting the sentence as plural, notes Poynter. So, \"All students must complete their homework, not Each student must complete his or her homework,\" per the guide. But when that kind of rewrite is \"impossible or hopelessly awkward,\" writers should employ the singular they. One big factor behind the shift\u2014not just at the Post but in newspapers, online posts, and English classrooms across the country\u2014is the increasing acceptance in society of those who identify as neither male nor female. The singular they solves the problem. (On a related note, the New York Times now permits \"Mx.\" as a gender-neutral honorific in place of Mr. or Ms., notes Quartz.) Grammatical purists may protest, but they are simply wrong, writes English teacher Anne Curzan at the Chronicle for Higher Education. \"There is nothing grammatically wrong with singular they other than the fact that people say there is something wrong with it,\" she writes, noting the similarity to the outdated rule, still enforced in places, about not splitting infinitives. Adds Anna Walsh at Baltimore's City Paper, \"Using language that's more accurately inclusive is something that every grammarian should be able to get behind, regardless of what pronouns they personally use.\" (The Internet seems to have invented a preposition.)"

The working theory is that wet springs followed by warm summers in Asia prompted gerbil populations to soar, and that within a few years plague bacteria would show up in harbor cities in Europe, sweeping the continent from there. \"If we're right, we'll have to rewrite that part of history,\" a researcher tells the BBC. \"Suddenly we could sort out a problem,\" the researcher continues. \"Why did we have these waves of plagues in Europe? We originally thought it was due to rats and climatic changes in Europe, but now we know it goes back to Central Asia.\" Next up: sequencing plague bacteria from skeletons across Europe.

After Trump signed an executive order Wednesday and promised to start building the wall within months, Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto told his country in a televised address that Mexico \"does not believe in walls\" and will not pay for it, no matter what Trump says, the BBC reports. \"I regret and condemn the decision of the United States to continue construction of a wall that, for years, has divided us instead of uniting us,\" he said. In other coverage: Pe\u00f1a Nieto said Mexico still offers its friendship to the US, but he didn't confirm whether he plans to go ahead with his Jan. 31 meeting with Trump at the White House, the Guardian reports. Senior government officials said late Wednesday that the Mexican leader is thinking about calling it off. CNN reports that Pe\u00f1a Nieto said he would wait for an evaluation from Mexican officials in the US before confirming the visit to the US. He also said he had ordered government agencies, including the 50 Mexican consulates in the US, to step up protection for immigrants. The Washington Post looks at five major challenges the wall project will face, including rough terrain and the fact that most land along the border in Texas is privately owned. In Mexico, people are furious and are calling for a stern response to Trump's plans, reports the New York Times. \"It's like we are Charlie Brown and they are Lucy with the football,\" says former foreign minister Jorge Castaneda. \"Pe\u00f1a is a weak president in a weak country at a weak moment, but he has to find a way to get some official backbone.\" Historians say the last president to anger Mexico this much was Calvin Coolidge, who threatened to invade \"Soviet Mexico\" in the 1920s. The Los Angeles Times looks at the details of the border wall project and other immigration-related actions Trump unveiled Wednesday. His plan to withhold federal grants from \"sanctuary cities\" like LA is expected to start legal battles that will last for years."

No elaboration was given. But that hasn't kept a religious bent out of discussion of and reactions to Nabra Hassanen's killing.

Balch Springs Police Chief Jonathan Haber says former officer Roy Oliver turned himself in Friday and was charged with the murder of Jordan, who was killed last Saturday night, the Dallas Morning News reports. Police initially said Oliver fired at the car because it was backing up aggressively toward officers. But bodycam footage shows the car was actually driving away at the time.

On Friday, Bloomberg Philanthropies announced it would commit $15 million to \"support the operations\" of the UN's Framework Convention on Climate Change, which coordinates the Paris climate agreement, CNN reports. The $15 million will cover the US' share of the convention's operating budget. The executive secretary of the Framework Convention on Climate Change calls the money \"crucial.\" On Thursday, after announcing the US was withdrawing from the Paris agreement, President Trump said the money the US had pledged to give the UN for climate matters was a \"draconian\" burden on the country. Bloomberg says he believes the US can hit its 2025 emissions reduction target laid out in the Paris climate agreement without the help of the federal government. \"The bulk of the decisions which drive US climate action in the aggregate are made by cities, states, businesses, and civil society,\" the New York Times quotes Bloomberg as saying in a letter to the UN secretary-general. Bloomberg says the federal government doesn't determine how the US as a whole acts on climate change. \"We're going to do everything America would have done if it had stayed committed,\" the former New York City mayor with an estimated worth of $50 billion says of group that includes mayors, governors, universities, and businesses."

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Scientists are trying to figure out what caused Indonesia's second-largest city, Palu, to be pummeled by a tsunami Friday, and they're not sure what caused it at all. \"We won't know what caused [it] until that's done,\" a University of California-Santa Barbara seismologist tells the New York Times. One possibility is that the tsunami was caused by an undersea landslide. Such a landslide would have displaced water and created waves, and the earthquake may have caused the rupture zone of the fault to move through an area where the seafloor rises or drops off, pushing seawater in front of it. Other possibilities are that the quake itself caused the tsunami, or that it was triggered by an earthquake-induced rupture on a strike-slip fault, reports the BBC. The death toll in Palu\u2014which is located on the island of Java\u2014now stands at more than 3,300, with more than 61,000 people injured, per the AP. In the wake of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami that killed more than a quarter-million people in Indonesia, the country promised to have a tsunami-detection system up and running by the end of this year. But the system has been \"simply put on hold\" since September, when the country's finance ministry, its geophysics agency, and a private company failed to come to an agreement on who should bear the brunt of the system's data. The project's final undersea point, off the coast of Padang, is just a few kilometers away.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The tsunami that killed hundreds, possibly thousands of people after an earthquake in Indonesia on Friday was much bigger and more devastating than would normally be expected after that kind of quake, scientists say. \"We expected it might cause a tsunami, just not one that big,\" geophysicist Jason Patton tells the New York Times. Tsunamis like the 18-foot monster wave that wrecked cities on Sulawesi island are usually caused by \"megathrust\" earthquakes that move land vertically, not \"strike-slip\" quakes like the 7.5-magnitude one Friday, which moved the earth horizontally, Patton says. The Sulawesi event was, however, localized, unlike the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. It may have been the case, Patton says, that massive undersea landslides created the tsunami, or that the narrow bay that Palu sits at the end of concentrated the wave's power. Indonesian authorities have been strongly criticized for apparently canceling the tsunami alert too early, though expert Adam Switzer at the Earth Observatory of Singapore tells the AP that this is unfair. \"What it shows is that the tsunami models we have now are too simplistic,\" he says. \"They don't take into account multiple events, multiple quakes within a short period of time. They don't take into account submarine landslides.\" The official death toll now stands at 844, though authorities, who have been preparing mass graves, have been unable to access some hard-hit areas, the Guardian reports."

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Pope Benedict XVI made his first public appearance since announcing his resignation today, presiding over Ash Wednesday celebrations from St. Peter's Basilica, the Wall Street Journal reports. He warned the cardinals who will elect his successor that \"the face of the church is at times disfigured by the sins against the unity of the Church and the divisions of the ecclesial body.\" He also made clear that he has no intention of interfering with his successor's work. The pope is expected to appoint the new chief of the Vatican bank, a move that would leave the next pontiff with a just-picked custodian to a secretive bank that, under Benedict, has denied allegations of money-laundering, the Journal notes. Benedict will give up all formal powers of his office, from the right to appoint bishops to the authority to issue infallible teachings, a Vatican spokesman says. But the ring that bears his office's seal will be smashed, paving the way for his successor to ascend the chair of Saint Peter. The former pope will continue to live inside Vatican City, where he will write and pray, according to Vatican officials. He will remain one of Roman Catholicism's leading theologians, an intellectual status that analysts and church officials say carries enormous weight for an institution. \"The Vatican belongs to the new pope, and needs the pope's permission to live there,\" says one senior fellow at Georgetown University. \"It's better to have him here than somewhere else,where he could become another center of power.\"",

Eric Peterson, 35, and his friend, 63-year-old Michael Hopper, had been enjoying their late-afternoon ski when the two heard a \"whoomp\" sound from about 20 feet above them, an Alaska State Troopers dispatch noted yesterday. The snow barreled down the mountain and covered the two men, but Hopper was able to extricate himself after two to three hours of strenuous digging. He found his friend's glove and started clawing through the snow until he got to Peterson's body, at which point he hightailed it to the Richardson Highway to find help. David Savage, a volunteer at the Lodge at Black Rapids about 20 miles away, says Hopper is the owner of the lodge and very familiar with weather conditions in that neck of the woods, spending plenty of time in the mountains there and even holding an avalanche safety course once a year at the lodge, KTUU reports. \"Mike is very educated in those mountains,\" Savage says, adding, \"Those mountains can be unpredictable.\" Indeed, the trooper dispatch noted that where Hopper and Peterson were skiing \"is widely unstable and continuing to deteriorate with the additional heavy snowfall,\" which is holding up efforts to recover Peterson's body. His family has been notified of his death, KTUU notes. (Avalanches could possibly halt future Everest attempts.)"

Researchers looked at the prescribing habits of more than 54,000 patients in 93 hospitals across the US and found that the \"highest and lowest prescribers\" in each hospital prescribed the most opioids, per a press release. The rate of \"high-intensity\" prescribers\u2014those who write the most prescriptions but who have the least number of emergency department visits\u2014was 10.3%, while the rate for \"low-intensity,\" or doctors who write only a few ER visits a year, was 5.2%. \"The bottom line is that we're seeing a lot of physicians who are not qualified to be prescribers of opioids,\" one of the study's authors tells the New York Times. \"And that's a problem.\" The researchers found that patients who saw a doctor who wrote at least 10 prescriptions in a two-year period were twice as likely to be prescribed an opioid for chronic pain than patients whose doctors wrote fewer than five prescriptions. And the more often a doctor wrote a prescription, the more likely the patient was to chronically use the drugs. The study doesn't prove a cause-and-effect link, but researchers say the findings suggest that doctors should be more careful about who they give opioids.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Scientists trying to better understand the nation's rising opioid addictions have uncovered an interesting wrinkle: A patient's risk of getting hooked might depend on which ER doctor they happen to get. In a New England Journal of Medicine study, researchers found that patients whose ER doctors are more likely to prescribe opioids are more likely to develop an addiction compared to the patients of ER doctors who prescribe less frequently. It may sound like an obvious chain of events, but it remains unclear why two patients given the same opioid prescription after similar complaints have different addiction risks depending on their ER doc. The takeaway is \"not that high-intensity prescribers are necessarily irresponsible in prescribing opioids to certain patients,\" the lead author tells the New York Times. But \"their patients have worse outcomes that we weren\u2019t aware of before.\" After tracking 375,000 Medicare patients in ERs between 2008 and 2011, researchers found that one in every 48 patients prescribed opioids ends up using them long-term, or more than half a year. But when comparing \"high-intensity\" prescribing docs (who gave opioids to one in four patients) to \"low-intensity\" prescribers (one in 14), patients of the first group had a 30% greater risk of turning into long-time users. It may be a simple numbers game, as observed in a post at Pacific Standard: \"The more prescriptions doctors give out, the more likely they'll end up handing a script to someone who will have a serious problem later.\" But one doctor sees a larger issue: Among ER doctors, there's no consensus \"about when to prescribe opioids and what dose to give.\" (This is how long it takes to become dependent.)"

North Korea has chemical and biological weapons that Chun estimates could be 2,500 to 5,000 tons, and Chun estimates that every North Korean, starting at age 14, gets 100 hours of training per year on how to shoot a weapon. He says China has realized it would prefer a nuclear-armed North Korea over an increased US presence in the region.",

The retired South Korean general, who the Financial Times reports led his country's special forces, spoke to a London-based think tank Wednesday and outlined exactly what American forces would encounter should we decide to bloody the country's nose\u2014or something more significant. He doesn't mince words: \"I try to explain to the Americans\u2014if we have to go into North Korea, ... it\u2019s not going to be like toppling [Saddam) Hussein]. This would be more like trying to get rid of Allah.\" He describes the country as \"one huge barracks\" and the population as militarized far beyond the [West's] imagination. \"A 14-year-old child in North Korea probably gets more than 100 hours of military training a year,\" the Times of London quotes Chun as saying. \"By age 14, a child knows how to fire an AK47, fire an RPG, throw a grenade, pitch a tent and march 24 hours.\" And even things that may seem promising on their face\u2014the North's estimated 1,000 fighter jets are aged\u2014aren't, per Chun, who says those planes would be used kamikaze-style, USA Today reports. And there's not just the physical battlefield to contend with, per the Brisbane Times: \"North Korean cyber capability is right below nuclear capability in terms of threat,\" says Chun. He also describes an extreme system designed to root out any dissent, whereby the country's families are grouped in units, and if one person \"misbehaves, the entire five or 10 families go to the gulag or are executed. So everybody spies on everybody else.\""

That's likely an all-time low, but it's still a far cry from the 60% who pleaded guilty in 1980, the New York Times reports. \"Prosecutors can say, 'Take these 10 years or, if you get a trial and are convicted, you\u2019re going to look at life,'\" says the report's author. \"That\u2019s a pretty amazing power that unfortunately they are more than willing to wield.\" Those who went to trial were sentenced to more than three times as many years in prison as those who took a plea, and the majority of them lost. The report blames mandatory-minimum sentencing laws for the steady increase in guilty pleas. \"If you can get someone to acknowledge guilt without the burden and expense of a trial, without having to marshal witnesses and line up witnesses, and without risking an acquittal, why not?\" says the author. But a rep for the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys says the government doesn't have the resources to try everyone charged with a drug offense. \"Justice would almost stand still if we took themajority of our cases to trial.\" Eric Holder has told federal prosecutors not to go after low-level drug offenders with mandatory minimum sentences, NPR reports.",

The trail is open to all, but \"those that choose to arrive unprepared can quickly find themselves in situations on the trail that begin to negatively affect others, as well as the trail environment,\" writes Kelly Servick at Outside. \"An influx of inexperienced, and often careless wanderers may invariably add strain to the fragile natural and human resources on which hikers rely.

He should know: Brook currently is trekking the 2,650-mile PCT, which runs from the Mexican border through California, Oregon, and Washington to the border with Canada. But don't take his word for it: The Pacific Crest Trail Association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail. To put things in perspective: 300 people attempted to complete the entire PCT in 2006, according to the AP, with about 120 of those making it. In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the PCTA's Jack Haskel told the AP in 2015. But after the movie, starring Reese Witherspoon, was released in 2014, interest in the PCT exploded. \"Millions are hearing about it now and are being inspired,\" Haskel said. Strayed, more or less unprepared for the journey, hiked 1,100 miles of the trail as a form of therapy as she grappled with personal demons. \"However for others that follow her strategy of deliberate ineptitude, things might not turn out so well,\" writes DontHikeLikeWild.org. \"Our advice to would-be hikers: Grow a spine first. Then get out there and hike the PCT.\" (This female hiker is the \"biggest badass you've never heard of.\")"

The credit card company says the biometric checks, which have been tested in the US and the Netherlands, will be rolled out in the UK soon, CNBC reports. \"I think the whole biometric space is a great way of protecting yourself when you are doing payments,\" a MasterCard exec says. \"There are a whole range of biometrics that say 'I'm me, I'm making a payment' and it just makes the whole thing more secure.\" According to the BBC, 92% of test subjects said they preferred using passwords. But instead of typing in 123456, users of the new system will be asked to look at their phone's camera or use its fingerprint sensor. If they opt for a selfie, they'll have to blink to prove they're not just holding up a photo. \"Consumers hate passwords,\" says Ajay Bhalla, chief of the company's safety and security division. \"We know the most commonly used password is 123456 ... If one site gets hacked all the places that you use the same password get compromised\u2014they are a big pain.\"",

If additional authentication is needed after online shoppers enter their credit card info, MasterCard users will be able to look into their phone or tablet's camera instead of entering a password, the BBC explains. \"Consumers hate passwords,\" says Ajay Bhalla, MasterCard's chief of safety and security. He says people use terrible, easily hackable passwords. Biometrics, such as facial recognition and the also-debuting fingerprint authentication, could reduce fraud for online shoppers. MasterCard tested out \"selfie pay\" in the US and Netherlands and found 92% of test subjects liked it. CNBC reports it could make online shopping easier, as MasterCard found 53% of people forget their password at least once a week, leading a third of online shoppers to just give up on buying anything. The next step for MasterCard is using people's heartbeats to verify their identity. People's hearts create their own signature electric signal, and MaserCard is testing out a bracelet that monitors it continuously and sends that information to nearby devices to authenticate the user. Bhalla calls it \"constant authentication.\" But that's still a ways off. MasterCard's facial recognition and fingerprint authentication will be rolled out this year."

He was just shooting at me.\" Slager's lawyer says he told Scott he was free to leave the vehicle and that the officer feared for his life. \"There's no doubt in my mind that he had his hands up and he made a move for something, and that's when he was shot,\" he says. The SC Appleseed Legal Justice Center, however, says \"killing someone over it\u2014that's just mind-boggling.\" Meanwhile, Scott's death is drawing national attention to the use of jail to force parents to pay child support. \"Parents who are truly go to jail over and over again for child Support Debt simply because they\u2019re poor,\" says a lawyer with the Southern Center for Human Rights, which filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of parents jailed without legal representation for failure to pay. \"We see many cases in which the person is released, they're given three months to pay a large amount of money.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The friend in the car with Walter Scott right before Scott's police-shooting death on April 4 says he'll \"never know why he ran.\" But Scott's family says it's because he was afraid of being thrown in jail again for not paying child support, according to the New York Times\u2014and based on the Times' report, he may have had ample reason for that fear. The paper notes challenges faced by supposed \"deadbeat\" dads who are actually living in poverty, running up their support tabs because they couldn't afford them in the first place, then getting thrown in jail and losing their jobs\u2014all while the debt builds. \"Parents who are truly destitute go to jail over and over again for child support debt simply because they're poor,\" a lawyer for the Southern Center for Human Rights tells the Times. Part of the problem right from the start: Support orders are often crafted using not a parent's actual income, but what's called \"imputed\" income, which gauges how much the parent would earn at a full-time job that made minimum wage. Indeed, a 2007 Urban Institute study cited by the Times notes that 70% of child support debt in nine states was owed by individuals who reported $10,000 or less in income (some didn't report any income). The commissioner of the federal Office of Child Support Enforcement tells the Times that jail time was originally intended for people purposely hiding funds\u2014not parents who couldn't afford the payments. Even a Supreme Court ruling from 2011 meant to prevent this from happening can prove futile, because some defendants can't afford lawyers to help them out, advocates say. In Scott's case, it was a cycle he apparently couldn't break. In a 2003 article on a new program in the Post and Courier, Scott noted he had enrolled in the program, meant to help dads catch up on payments, and voluntarily turned himself in for more jail time. \"This whole time in jail, my child support is still going up,\" he said at the time. \"I said, 'Man, you got four kids depending on you. \u2026 You got to get it together.\""

The study, which looked at responses to questions about vegetarianism, veganism, and vegetarianism in a nationally representative sample of 1,002 adults, also found that current vegetarians and vegans have a wide range of reasons for keeping the diet, from wanting to be more involved in their communities to simply not being able to deal with certain food cravings, reports the Los Angeles Times. \"The findings presented here offer a lot of possible avenues for new strategic thinking in veg advocacy, and how we might move the vegetarian/vegan diet from the margins more towards the center,\" the study's lead author says in a press release. \"There is rarely just one reason for people adopting or giving up a veg diet, it is not completely clear if lapses are due more to social pressures (eating a diet that seems unusual or outside the norm), or based on some other difficulty inherent to the diet itself.\" A second study, published in the American Journal of Epidemiology, looked at the habits and motivations of 956 vegetarians andvegans and found that they were still eating about the same amount of meat as their non-vegetarian counterparts, though some were eating more than they used to and others weren't eating as much at all.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It seems becoming a vegetarian and staying a vegetarian are two very different things. A whopping 84% of vegetarians end up eating meat again, and most people shift back within a single year, according to a new study. Specifically, 53% of vegetarians are meat-eaters again within 12 months, while more than 30% go back to meat within three months, the Huffington Post reports. Of the 11,000 people studied, 2% were vegetarians, 10% former vegetarians, and 88% lifelong meat-eaters. A major reason for lapsing, it seems, was social: Those who returned to being omnivorous didn't have enough support among friends for their vegetarian lifestyles. Earlier research points to health issues from staying meat-free, the Smithsonian reports. Some 35% of respondents to a separate survey of lapsed vegetarians said their own poorer health drove them back to animal flesh, Skeptoid reports. \"I will take a dead cow over anemia anytime,\" says one respondent. And in the Guardian, a lapsed vegetarian writes about the inconvenience of avoiding meat, as well as the feeling of \"every cell in my body screaming 'protein\u2014that's what you need.'\" Perhaps the writer would agree with the conclusions of the new study, as Co.Exist reports them: \"A message focused on reduction instead of elimination of animal products may be more effective to create an overall decline in animal product consumption.\" (Read about a veggie burger that \"bleeds\" like meat.)"

It was discovered again in 2002 and remained in his crypt for the next 75 years. \"To me, it is the greatest miracle in life,\" spiritual leader Hambo Lama Ayusheyev said at the time. \"It turns out there are things on which time has no power.\" Now, 13 years after the discovery, authorities say the monk's body was stolen from another part of the country and had been planned for sale on the black market, with local media claiming he wanted to take it over the Mongolian border. A 45-year-old man was arrested after police uncovered the plot and \"quickly arrested\" him, according to the Times. It's not clear how the corpse was stolen, but \"police have revealed that the monk had been stolen and was about to be sold off,\" the paper says. \"He had then been planning to sell it.\" Buddhist expert Barry Kerzin tells the Telegraph the monk is in a state of meditation called \"tukdam,\" or \"one stage away from becoming a real-life Buddha.\" \"If the meditator can continue to stay in this meditative state, he can become a Buddha,\" says Kerzin, who is the physician of the Dalai Lama, who says the monk was the only the only a religious practice.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The 200-year-old Buddhist monk found still seated in the lotus position is not dead, but is rather in a rare spiritual state known as tukdam, Buddhism experts suggest. Dr. Barry Kerzin, a famous fellow monk who is also a physician to the Dalai Lama, tells the Siberian Times that monks in this state go into \"very deep meditation\" and, if they can stay in such a state for more than three weeks, their bodies shrink until all that remains are \"hair, nails, and clothes,\" he says. \"Usually in this case, people who live next to the monk see a rainbow that glows in the sky for several days. This means that he has found a 'rainbow body.' This is the highest state close to the state of Buddha,\" and someone who remains in the state can even become a Buddha, he says. He adds that over the past five decades, there have been 40 such cases in India. Ganhugiyn Purevbata, founder and professor at the Mongolian Institute of Buddhist Art at Ulaanbaatar Buddhist University, agrees: The monk \"is sitting in the lotus position vajra, the left hand is opened, and the right hand symbolizes of the preaching Sutra,\" he says. \"This is a sign that the Lama is not dead, but is in a very deep meditation according to the ancient tradition of Buddhist lamas.\" But scientists have a different take, theorizing that the cold weather in Mongolia, where the monk was found, helped preserve him, the BBC reports. And the Washington Post notes that such \"accidental mummies\" have been discovered in freezing climates before, like a 9,000-year-old mummified bison in Siberia. Meanwhile, there is drama of a less spiritual type unfolding: Police say a man stole the monk from a cave in another part of the country and was planning to sell him on the black market, but police learned of the plot, recovered the monk, and arrested the man for smuggling.

Now, behavioral researchers Jason Rogers and Abbe Macbeth with Noldus Information Technology have used science to uncover why some people's resting faces are expressionless while those of others are considered angry and judgmental, the Washington Post reports. The pair used software called FaceReader, which maps 500 points on the human face and assigns expressions based on the emotions of happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, contempt, and \"neutral.\" When the researchers plugged in faces of famous RBF faces, the software lit up. \"Something in the person's face is relaying greater-than-trace amounts of contempt, but they don't intend that to be the case,\" Macbeth tells CBS News. That includes signals, Rogers tells the Post, such as \"one side of the lip pulled back slightly, the eyes squinting a little.\" One key point: The researchers found that the condition afflicts men and women equally. \"This means that classifying RBF as a female-dominant expression of bitchiness is actually quite wrong, and probably a reflection of societal expectations of women,\" observes the post at New York. (The Stir amplifies the point that men are affected, too, with a gallery of Kanye West RBF photos.) Can anything be done about RBF? \"We can't 'fix' anyone's face,\" Macbeth, also a sufferer tells CBS.

The 35-year-old married father of two young girls was arrested on June 1 while making an delivery to the garrison in Fort Hamilton.

Dianne Feinstein, accusing them of interfering with federal immigration efforts by passing and enforcing state laws that hinder US operations against undocumented people, the AP reports. The lawsuit states that the Constitution gives the US government sweeping authority over immigration and accuses California of blocking enforcement efforts by the Department of Homeland Security and imposing other, impermissible obligations on the federal government. One of the laws under federal challenge bars private employers from voluntarily cooperating with immigration officials and requires businesses to notify workers in advance of a federal raid. A second law restricts state and local law enforcement from voluntarily sharing information with the feds about the release dates of undocumented people in their custody. The third law covers state inspections of detention facilities that hold noncitizens in federal custody.

We can offer counseling,'\" she tells the Leicester Mercury. Instead, she and her husband, Dean Wilkins, opted for a risky surgery that has now saved their baby girl's life, the New York Times reports. Vanellope Hope Wilkins was born three weeks ago with an extremely rare condition known as ectopia cordis, in which the heart and part of her stomach are growing outside her body. Doctors at the Glenfield Hospital in Leicester thought she had less than a 10% chance of survival. Now, three weeks after her birth, she has undergone three operations to put her heart back in her chest. \"Before she was born, things looked very bleak, but now they are quite a lot better\u2014Vanellope is doing really well and has proved very resilient,\" the hospital's cardiologist tells the BBC. \"In the future, we may be able to put in some internal bony protection for her heart\u2014perhaps using 3D printing or something organic that would grow with her.\" The condition is so rare that experts say they don't know of another case in the US where a baby has survived it. \"I felt guilty for thinking negative thoughts because here she is fighting, and there was I, about to give up. I'm glad I stuck to my guns not to terminate,\" Findlay tells the Mercury. (Click to read about another baby who survived a rare form of the heart.)",

The fetus in her womb was growing a heart\u2014but in a rare case of ectopia cordis, it was outside of the body, as was a portion of the stomach, giving the fetus less than a 10% chance of survival, reports the Guardian. Three weeks after giving birth a month prematurely, however, Findlay, 31, and Dean Wilkins, 43, are the proud parents of a baby girl believed to be the first in the UK to survive such a condition, joining a few others in the US, per the New York Times. Less than an hour after she was delivered via caesarean section on Nov. 22, Vanellope Hope Wilkins went into her first of three surgeries at Leicester's Glenfield Hospital to relocate her heart into her chest. Doctors say she's now doing well, though she remains on a ventilation machine. Getting to this point wasn't easy. After the first surgery, doctors had to wait for Vanellope's chest to grow to make room for the heart. With doctors assisting, the heart eventually moved into a cavity through gravity. Doctors then created a mesh to protect the heart, as Vanellope was born without ribs or a sternum, and in the final surgery, they covered the hole with skin taken from under the infant's arms. \"In a way her strength gave me a strength to keep going,\" Findlay tells the BBC. \"No one believed she was going to make it except us,\" adds Wilkins. \"It's beyond a miracle.\" A pediatric cardiologist says Vanellope \"has proved very resilient.\" The main focus now is to prevent infection, but \"in the future we may be able to put in some internal bony protection for her heart, perhaps using 3D printing or something organic that would grow with her.\" (Heart surgery saved an unborn child in Canada.)"

Virginia-based American Tradition Partnership is asking the nation's high court to rule without a hearing because the state law conflicts straight with Citizens United. Montana and the other states want the court to either let the Montana Supreme Court decision stand or to hold a full hearing on the matter.

The other states, many with their own type of restrictions hanging in the balance, argue local restrictions are far different than the federal ban the court decided unconstitutionally restricted free speech. Further, state elections are at much greater risk than federal elections of being dominated by corporate money, requiring tailored regulation. \"There is a growing bipartisan consensus that Citizens United needs to be overturned, and Montana is leading the way,\" says a spokesman for a group called Free Speech For People. \"The Supreme Court has an opportunity to revisit Citizens United here.\" But legal observers say it's a long shot. \"It is highly unlikely that the Court would reverse its decision in Citizens United,\" a law professor at the University of California-Irvine tells the AP. \"At best, the court would listen to arguments and might agree a clarification is needed to allow the Montana law to stand.\"",

The twins' gender was not revealed, and the only identifying details given by Vietnam's state-run news agency VNS is that the children have very different hair (thick and wavy vs. thin and straight) and live in Hoa Binh province with their 34-year-old father and mother, whose age wasn't given. Le Dinh Luong, president of the Genetic Association of Vietnam, says he's unaware of any case like this in his country. That hasn't stopped paranoid fathers from phoning the Hanoi center over fears about their twins, reports the Tuoi Tre paper. It's rare, but certainly not unheard of in the US. Last year, a New Jersey judge ruled a man is father to one twin while another man is father to the other, in a case that had child-support implications. The judge in that case cited two other similar court cases, and a 1997 article by identity testing expert Karl-Hans Wurzinger, who testified in the case, put the number of reported paternity cases involving superfecundation (the fathering of fraternal twins by two males) at one in every 13,000.

By ceasing to place outsize bets on companies, industries, or countries, the men also eliminate the temptation to focus too much on the short. They say the move will save the funds $4 million a year in fees, per the Times.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 If your visions of high-profile hedge fund managers include frenetic scrambling through paperwork, fielding endless phone calls, and scouring the Internet during never-ending workdays, those don't apply to Steve Edmundson, the investment head of Nevada's $35 billion Public Employees' Retirement System, the Wall Street Journal notes. Where other states' retirement systems try to come up with the most complex investments possible to beat the markets, the 44-year-old Edmundson has a different philosophy when it comes to day-to-day trading: \"Do as little as possible, usually nothing,\" as the Journal puts it. And by \"nothing,\" that means not obsessing over the daily fluctuations in oil prices, the elections, or even what Janet Yellen is up to\u2014an approach that's rare among managers of large pension funds, the New York Times noted last year in an article about Edmundson. This laissez-faire tactic has served Edmundson well: His system's returns over anywhere from one to 10 years are competitive, if not better, than the pension systems of other states, including the largest public one\u2014California's. Even Edmundson's desk looks like it's his first day on the job, with just basic office supplies, a few family pics, and a printer\u2014no fancy Bloomberg Terminal to monitor real-time market info. Edmundson is able to kick back by keeping the system's stocks and bonds in low-cost index funds, though one investment strategy expert (who held the job before Edmundson) concedes \"doing nothing is harder than it looks\" when it comes to showing such restraint. Edmundson's minimalist philosophy even carries over to lunch: He brings leftovers or a sandwich from home so he doesn't have to spend $10 each day. (A typical Steve Edmundson day, in the Wall Street Journal.)"

By the afternoon, a helicopter had found both the haystack and the needle, to tragic ends. Ron and Mary Tarnowski were found dead in the Brookston area, near a hunting shack the family owned about 30 miles from Duluth. Foul play isn't suspected. The Washington Post reports the couple lived near one of their sons, Karl Tarnowski, who noticed they uncharacteristically didn't return home on July 29. The Duluth News Tribune reports the couple didn't have cellphones or credit cards on them, nor did their car's OnStar system engage, leaving authorities with little to go on. But there was, perhaps, a general area: Their last sighting had been at 1pm on the day they went missing at a corner store near Brookston. KARE reports the Tarnowskis' Chevy Tahoe was found in a remote area, apparently stuck on what seemed to be a \"swampy\" trail typically accessed by snowmobilers in the winter. Mary, 78, was in the vehicle; Ron, 82, was outside it, some 50 feet from the road, suggesting he had gone in search of help. Karl tells the Post that it's thought both died the day they went missing; Mary is believed to have succumbed to dehydration and heat. The couple is depicted as a devoted one: A stroke at age 42 left Mary paralyzed on her right side; Ron was constantly by her side, but had himself begun to show early signs of dementia.

He survived with only a scratch and told a police officer he'd fallen asleep at the wheel. The officer suspected the crash might've been intentional and the 27-year-old spent a night at a mental health facility in Frisco. A day later, the Breckenridge man was released and disappeared, reports the Washington Post. His family told the Summit Daily News McAtee had 10 days earlier stopped taking his medication for bipolar disorder, just as he had done a few times before when he dropped out of sight, but he always resurfaced. Over the next year, they scoured the country in search of him, thinking perhaps he'd gone off the grid like Chris McCandless, the subject of his favorite book, Into the Wild. They reached out to contacts in Alaska, where McAtee had flown planes, and homeless shelters, where they thought he might volunteer, but found no sign of him. In July, McAtee's father wrote online that \"there is a 50% chance that Jack wandered off into the wilderness and attempted to survive.\" But a month later, two hikers found a skull near the top of the Peak One, immediately south of Frisco; DNA confirmation that the skull was McAtee's came earlier this month. \"Our search has come to fruition,\" McAtee's family wrote. \"Our closure is at hand, albeit we acknowledge it will be a lifelong process.\" It's still not clear how or when McAtee died. His skull was all that was found of his remains, reports the Denver Post. What is certain: \"A person, an irreplaceable person, is gone,\" his family says. But \"the story's not over,\" McAtee's father adds. The family is hoping to raise $50,000 to build wells in Kenya in McAtee's memory. Nearly $15,000 has been raised so far.

More from the hearing, courtesy of Politico and CNN's liveblog. Alexander said 90% of those cases were disrupted by the PRISM web spying program. The NSA said that while it has assembled a massive database of call tracking information, it has targeted fewer than 300 numbers or other \"identifiers\" within it. Deputy Attorney General James Cole stressed that the NSA must get permission from the secret FISA court to access phone data, and must have evidence linking their target to a terrorist organization. \"This is not a program that's off the books that's been hidden away,\" Cole said. But Cole also said that the Fourth Amendment didn't apply to phone records, and that people shouldn't expect privacy for them. NSA Deputy Director Chris Inglis said that just 22 people at the NSA are authorized to query the phone database. Alexander said the NSA has neither the legal authority nor technical ability to \"flip a switch\" and listen to a phone conversation. The NSA brass wasn't exactly facing an inquisition.

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 For 75 years, scientists have been debating the true identity of Dickinsonia, the world's oldest known animal. Now, they say they've finally solved the mystery. In a study published in Science, researchers from Australia's Australian National University say Dickinsonia lived on Earth 558 million years ago\u2014millions of years earlier than they previously thought\u2014and they have found molecules of fat in an ancient fossil that proves it. \"The fossil fat molecules that we've found prove that animals were large and abundant 558 millions years ago,\" says lead researcher Associate Professor Jochen Brocks. \"Scientists have been fighting for more than 75 years over what Dickinsonia and other bizarre fossils of the Edicaran Biota were: giant single-celled amoeba, lichen, failed experiments of evolution, or the earliest animals on Earth,\" he says in a press release. The team found Dickinsonia fossils with organic matter still intact in rocks in a remote part of Russia, where they \"had to hang over the edge of a cliff on ropes and dig out huge blocks of sandstone, throw them down, wash the sandstone, and repeat this process until I found the fossils I was after,\" researcher Ilya Bobrovskiy tells the Washington Post. \"I took a helicopter to reach the sandstone.\" The team believes Dickinsonia produced cholesterol, which is unique in ancient life because all organics break down, leaving only the \"original skeleton of the cholesterol\" preserved in molecular fossils. Researchers believe the cholesterol is responsible for the hair's color and for its ability to grow long, Newsweek. \"What you get is an average composition of the ecosystem that was found in Siberia.",

That conclusion comes thanks to fat, reports Phys.org. Ilya Bobrovskiy of Australian National University discovered a Dickinsonia fossil in 300-foot-high cliffs along the White Sea in northwest Russia, in a place so remote she reached it via helicopter. The fossil was superbly preserved, so much so that its tissue had cholesterol molecules present in it. \"The fossil fat molecules that we've found prove that animals were large and abundant 558 million years ago, millions of years earlier than previously thought,\" says ANU professor Jochen Brocks, co-author of the paper on the discovery, which was published in Science. The Cambrian explosion that gave rise to modern animal groups didn't happen for another 20 million years or so. As for the oval Dickinsonia's appearance, the BBC describes it as possibly bearing \"a superficial resemblance to a segmented jellyfish.\" National Geographic delves into the difficulty of studying Ediacarans, who had no shells or bones to leave behind and whose \"squishy bodies have long since decayed.\" Read more on how the team overcame that here."

Eyebrows were raised about the veracity of Zhang Wei's purchase after photos were posted online of Zhang posing with the bottle and the manager of the Waldhaus Am See hotel; the Swiss hotel's Devil's Place whisky bar has a 2,500-bottle collection. The prime condition of the vintage bottle, and the wording on the label didn't add up, said doubters. They were right. The BBC reports a series of lab tests were performed and returned all-around negative results. University of Oxford researchers carbon dated the sample and say there's a 95% probability it was produced between 1970 and 1972.

Where did it all go wrong for the Wisconsin governor? Insiders tell Politico that Walker was overconfident, and though he tried to act as his own campaign manager, he seemed to be \"making it up as he went along,\" causing plenty of strategic blunders. Fundraising dried up as Donald Trump's rise pushed him to the sidelines, leaving him with a large organization but little support. His sudden departure from the race came after he failed to make an impression at the second debate and a CNN poll found his support at well below 1%. \"He was a terrible candidate, but he also got Trump-ed,\" a source tells Politico. More: Sources tell CNN that although a super PAC supporting him had plenty of cash, Walker's campaign funds started to dry up after the first debate as donors looked elsewhere. Walker \"is a pragmatist above all else and just didn't see the path to a comeback\" after his poll numbers collapsed even in Iowa, a campaign insider says. Walker was hurt by flip-flops on issues like birthright citizenship, where he changed his position three times in a week, CNN notes, and by gaffes like suggesting he would consider building a wall along the Canadian border. In his exit speech last night, Walker said he had been \"called to lead by helping to clear the field in this race so that a positive conservative message can rise to the top of the field.\" He urged other candidates to follow his lead so a clear alternative to Trump could emerge, the Washington Post reports. Some of Walker's former rivals praised him as he left the race, including Marco Rubio, who called him \"one of the best governors in the country,\" and Donald Trump, who said \"he's a very nice person and has a great future,\" reports the Hill. The rival campaigns didn't wait until Walker announced his exit to start trying to poach his aides and his donors, the AP reports. The competition heated up after the announcement: A source close to the billionaire Ricketts family, which had supported Walker, tells the AP that within minutes of the governor's press conference, the family received calls from six campaigns, some of them from the candidates themselves.

One of the six 136-foot covers draped over one of the plant's nuclear reactors to keep radioactive materials from seeping out is being painstakingly removed. Tepco officials say it will take till the end of 2016 to pry all six covers off, and till at least 2020 to remove the nearly 300 spent fuel rods lurking underneath. The project, which was supposed to commence last July, was previously postponed because of fears of radiation escaping. \"For the safety of Fukushima's residents, we would like the work to proceed with extra care,\" says the chief of a group of monitors overseeing the project. The total cost and time for the entire decommissioning assignment: tens of billions of dollars over 30 years or so, NBC notes. Meanwhile, the Japanese government today approved an increase in compensation payments to Tepco to a total of $57.2 billion, Reuters reports. That's $7.7 billion added onto the $49.5 billion in taxpayer-funded aid that Tepco had previously been approved to receive.

They say flying is the cheapest and safest it has ever been, affordable for the majority of Americans, and safest of all. In fact, on-time arrivals are hovering around 80%, the best they've ever been. So this is a conundrum. How can flying be both the best and the worst it\u2019s ever been? Business Insider asked more than 80 airline workers\u2014including flight attendants, gate agents, ticket agents, and other airport customer service reps\u2014to weigh in. Here are some of the things they couldn't say: \"I'm not talking to hear myself speak. It's not my job to say that.\" \"You could give me an in-flight entertainment system loaded with the entire library of human artistic achievement and I would still somehow be bored because I am on an airplane, waiting. Then I think about the fact I'm waiting. And now I\u2019m noticing my butt's sore. And the guy in front of me.\" \"I love my job is my job: I's worse. I could be a problem. \"I could be an issue, because the most.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Though the number of complaints on Twitter might lead you to believe otherwise, \"Flying has never been better.\" At least according to the industry experts the Outline spoke with, who pointed out that taking to the friendly skies has gotten safer and more on time (arrivals are now punctual about 80% of the time). And while it may not feel like it, it's cheaper, too, at least compared to the early '70s, when price fixing meant a flight from New York to LA was not allowed to cost less than about $1,600 in today's dollars. The Outline's full story works to bust some misconceptions, and Business Insider does something similar. It talks to 80 airline workers\u2014the ones who staff the gates, the planes, the customer service lines\u2014to share the secrets they wish they could share. Here are 5 standouts: Know I'm not being rude when I don't give you a free upgrade: One customer service agent explains \"the airline computer system tracks everything, and big brother can be watching us\"\u2014and doling out a free upgrade improperly can be a fireable offense. Don't take off your shoes: It might be tempting to wiggle those toes under the seat, but this isn't your house, and that \"water\" you're stepping on in the bathroom isn't actually water. Don't let those hands wander: If you're tempted to tug at your flight attendant's clothes to get his or her attention as they walk by, just don't. Ever. Keep the number 50 in mind: That's how many passengers are generally served by a single flight attendant. We're not forgetting about you, explains one. We're just dealing with minimal staffing. Know I have to do what the FAA says: That includes saying specific things. Not following the FAA's rules and regulations could cause a flight attendant to be fined.

The aircraft carrier was found off the coast of Papua New Guinea last week and will be returned to its home port of Ulithi Atoll in the Pacific for the first time in more than 50 years, reports the New York Times. The ship, commissioned in 1943, was part of a group of US aircraft carriers that attacked Japanese cruisers and planes near the Pacific island of Rabaul in November 1943. The Japanese planes didn't shoot down the carriers, however, and one of them managed to score a direct hit on the Independence's starboard quarter, causing serious damage. The warship was all but lost until 1990, when the US Geological Survey found it while mapping the seafloor. Oceanographer Robert Ballard, who discovered the Titanic, the Bismarck, and the John F.

This week, however, thousands of viewers watched as the first photos other than sonar scans of the 623-foot aircraft carrier were shown live online, courtesy of the same ocean explorer who discovered the Titanic, among other famous shipwrecks\u2014and those pics show the Independence is in remarkably good shape in its watery grave. \"There's very little change from when the Navy scuttled it,\" Robert Ballard says of his team's documentation, in conjunction with the Navy and the NOAA, adding the Titanic was similarly well-kept. \"The deep sea is the largest museum on Earth.\" Viewers saw such wonders as the Independence's sponge-covered flight deck, a Grumman Hellcat fighter plane, and even the ship's name imprinted on its hull, all at the same time as researchers on the Nautilus exploration vessel, who sent out two remote-controlled submersibles Monday and Tuesday to capture the pictures about 30 miles west of Half Moon Bay. What the deep-sea dive didn't find: any evidence of the atomic waste rumored to have been sunk with the ship, per USA Today, though a UC Berkeley nuclear engineering expert tells the Mercury News any danger posed by such waste would've long since dissipated. The 74-year-old Ballard says he treated his newest subject with the same respect he does all his shipwrecks, leaving artifacts intact. \"Taking things off would be like bringing a shovel to Gettysburg,\" he says.

According to the New York Times, court documents state an unnamed Spanish instructor told Mol in English: \"No jump, it's important, no jump.\" The appeals court ruled it's clear Mol could have heard \"now jump\" due to the instructor's \"incorrect use and pronunciation of English\" as she immediately leaped from the bridge. The court ruled the instructor should have said \"don't jump.\" The Daily Mail notes protocol called for the instructor to say exactly that. The ruling clears the way for the instructor to face criminal charges, including accidental homicide, should prosecutors choose to bring them. The Telegraph reports the director of the company that employs the instructor will face prosecution for homicide through negligence. The court found a number of faults with the company beyond ruling the instructor didn't speak English well enough to instruct foreigners in something as dangerous as bungee jumping.

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 India chose an \"untouchable\" as its next president Thursday after the first contest in which both candidates were from the lowest tier of the country's caste system. Ram Nath Kovind, nominated by the ruling BJP party, had been clear favorite for the largely ceremonial post, which is decided by 4,800 lawmakers across the country. Under India's constitution, the prime minister and his ministers wield executive power but the president sometimes plays a role such as deciding which party should form a government if a general election is inconclusive. Kovind is not the first president to be \"Dalit,\" a term that means \"oppressed\" in Sanskrit and refers to members of the lowest caste. Kocheril Ramanan took office in 1997 more than half a century after Gandhi pledged to end the country\u2019s ancient system of discrimination. It is, however, the first time since India gained independence from Britain in 1947 that both the final candidates were Dalit\u2014former diplomat Meira Kumar was also low-caste\u2014and it is also the first times that the upper-Caste dominated BJP has nominated a Dalit for the job. One-fifth of all parliamentary candidates must be Dalit under decades-long affirmative-action laws introduced to improve representation and outlaw discrimination. The Guardian reports that Kovind's election is widely seen as part of a strategy by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to widen support among the 200 million-strong Dalit community. Dalits, who are often referred to as untouchables, occupy the lowest rung of the caste system, which still sees them as \"impure.\"",

In India, the real power is with the prime minister. Kovind isn't actually the first Dalit president, the first coming in 1997, notes NBC News. In fact, one analyst tells the network that the real significance of the election isn't the caste factor but its reflection of the growing power of the ruling BJP Party. Both Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi belong to the BJP (which is why the election was never really in doubt), and Modi's blessing of Kovind is seen as a calculated strategy to woo other members of the 200-million-strong Dalit community. \"Dalit politics suddenly has come center stage with a bang,\" another analyst tells the New York Times. \"Every leader is bending over backward to show, 'I am a well-wisher.'\" India elects its vice president next month, and BJP is counting on another win to cement its influence over Parliament."

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 In what one conservationist is calling an \"environmental nightmare,\" an estimated 4,000 to 5,000 Atlantic salmon busted out of their holding pen over the weekend after a net broke, and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife is now pleading with locals to help catch as many as they can. Cooke Aquaculture's net pen was holding around 305,000 farmed salmon when anchor lines to the pen gave way and service walkways tipped on Saturday, reports the Seattle Times. The WDFW is now asking for the public's help in scooping the escaped fish out of the waters near Cypress Island (or wherever they may turn up), with no size or quantity restrictions. The exodus has environmentalists concerned, as they're afraid the farmed escapees could take over the feeding and spawning grounds of native chinook and steelhead salmon and pass on disease, KUOW notes. Cooke says in a statement that \"exceptionally high tides and currents coinciding with this week's solar eclipse\" contributed to the \"structural failure\" that led to the salmon's breakout. But environmentalists are pushing back on that, KING 5 notes, with one organization claiming Cooke had the same net issue earlier this summer. KUOW also reports that tide tables and current and wind speed numbers weren't unusually high on Saturday. A Cooke spokeswoman doubled down on the eclipse explainer late Tuesday, and she also added that the escaped salmon weren't a threat to native fish because they wouldn't survive. \"It's primarily a business loss,\" she tells the Times. The salmon, which weigh about 10 pounds each, \"will be food for the seals and the fishermen can enjoy them.\" (Is California's salmon population in big trouble?)"

CNN reports the computer program was able to correctly detect depression from a person's Instagram account 70% of the time.

Researchers found the Instagram posts of depressed people tended to be less saturated, darker, and more blue. Depressed people tended to use the Inkwell filter most often (non-depressed people preferred Valencia) and got more comments on their posts (non-depressed people got more likes). Depressed people also posted more photos of faces but had fewer faces per photo.

Because I always wanted them. It was just hard for me to have friends.\" She adds that she never said the song was about Katy Perry: \"I never said anything that would point a finger in the specific direction of one specific person, and I can sleep at night knowing that. I knew the song would be assigned to a person.\" More from the interview: On writing \"Blank Space\": \"It was about the loss of friendship. But nobody thinks that song is about a guy. But they would have. So I don\u2019t necessarily care who people think it\u2019s about. I just needed to divert them away from the easiest target. Listen to the song. It doesn\u2019t point to any one person or any one situation. But if you\u2019d listened to my previous four, I don't feel lonely.\" On feeling lonely: \"When I go home and turn on the TV, I'm like, 'Oh, my God.

Would any of this have happened if I was? In that sense, I do think about things before they happen.

Dlisted, Celebuzz, and Gigwise think it's likely Edward Droste, member of the indie rock band Grizzly Bear, who earlier this year called Swift not only calculating but frightening, mean, rude, and arrogant (though he at first wouldn't say who he was talking about). As for the rest of the GQ interview, Swift also discusses the rumor that her song \"Bad Blood\" is about Katy Perry (she basically fueled the rumor because she didn't want anyone to think the song was about one of her exes) and the VMAs moment when Kanye West stormed the stage and interrupted her acceptance speech. \"That was the most happenstance thing to ever happen in my career,\" she says. \"And to now be in a place where Kanye and I respect each other\u2014that's one of my favorite things that has happened in my career.\" Click for the full piece."

A large US expedition called WISSARD, led by a professor at Montana State University, has unearthed a thriving ecosystem of micro-organisms after drilling through the thick ice to reach Subglacial Lake Whillans in January of 2013, according to a university news release. Considered one of the planet's final frontiers, the subglacial environments below Antarctic ice sheets have long been suspected to harbor life of some kind. Many of the micro-organisms found are single-celled organisms, called Archaea, that survive by converting ammonium and methane into energy in a harsh environment similar to those found elsewhere in our solar system, such as on Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa. That has led scientists to wonder whether primitive (but hearty) life thrives there as well, Forbes reports. \"It's the first definitive evidence that there\u2019s not only life, but active ecosystems underneath the Antarctic ice sheet, something that we have been guessing about for decades,\" the lead author says. \"With this paper, we pound the table and say, 'Yes, we were right.'\" The findings appear today in the journal Nature.

The fast-track legislation would give Obama the power to present a final deal to Congress for an up-or-down vote without lawmakers being able to amend the terms. A similar bill is expected to be introduced in the House in the coming weeks. The 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership is seen as one of the biggest free trade pacts in US history, but it faces fierce opposition from labor unions and environmental groups who say it will kill US jobs and benefit multinational corporations, the Washington Post reports. \"It's no secret that past trade deals haven't always lived up to their promise, and that's why I will only sign my name to an agreement that helps ordinary Americans get ahead,\" Obama said in a statement today. \"At the same time, at a moment when 95% of our potential customers live outside our borders, we must make sure that we, and not countries like China, are writing the rules for the global economy.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 One of President Obama's biggest goals for his home stretch in office took a big step forward today with a deal struck by leading Republicans and Democrats. It's regarding the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed pact with 11 Pacific Rim nations that the Hill notes would be the biggest trade deal since NAFTA. In this case, the usual DC politics are flipped: Most Democrats oppose the president and most Republicans support him, reports the Wall Street Journal. Despite today's progress\u2014it was introduced as \"fast-track\" legislation in the House and Senate\u2014its ultimate fate is unclear in Congress. The New York Times predicts that for Obama, it will be \"one of the toughest legislative battles of his last 19 months in office.\" Making it fast-track legislation means that lawmakers would vote yes or no on the deal once the US and the other nations agree on terms, but they would not be able to add amendments. That greatly increases Obama's chances of getting other nations\u2014including Japan, Vietnam, Canada, and Mexico\u2014to sign on, because they wouldn't have to fear later changes. A sign of the challenges supporters face: The AFL-CIO says it will spend six figures on ads going after 16 senators and 36 members of the House, reports the Washington Post. The group is worried about the loss of US jobs, but Obama says the deal is necessary if America hopes to stay competitive against China."

Police say they will release body camera and helicopter footage of the shooting within a week.

The country's economy minister has promised he won't have appointments after 1pm on the so-called \"Premium Friday\" days, the BBC reports. The idea is to encourage workers to spend more time with family and friends, which has proven to be a hard sell in the past. \"Japanese workers worry about letting down their colleagues,\" the chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute says. \"They have a strong sense of working as a team.\" He says that private consumption could rise by $1.2 billion per Premium Friday if \"100%\" of workers showed up, though he warns that that could be a \"much smaller boost to the economy.\" Japan has long had a reputation for working long hours, with 22% of its population clocking more than 49 hours a week, behind South Korea's 35% and the US' 16%. Supporters of the plan say it will reduce work-related stress and give workers more time to spend with their families. But it will be a tough sell in a country where many family-run businesses are struggling to keep costs down. The Japan Business Federation has encouraged its members to sign up, but there are only around 1,300 companies in the country of more than 2.5 million, and even the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry hasn't indicated whether its workers will take part.",

The move isn't mandatory for companies, but the nation's biggest business lobby is on board and encouraging its members to take part when it launches on Feb. 24. It doesn't help that most workers in Japan tend to use only half their allotted paid time off, and that an estimated one in eight work 50 hours or more\u2014the highest percentage among G-7 nations. So it remains unclear whether Premium Friday will be a sufficient break for the overworked, or even attainable for those who must squeeze in their work at other times. Fortune is skeptical, calling it an \"essentially meaningless\" scheme. It quotes a critic who says the bigger issue to focus on is efficiency to cut down on those long work weeks, which are \"still considered a virtue.\" Another problem is that Japan has lots of small, family-run businesses where shortened hours could be a problem, notes the BBC.

The Navy says the McCain, which suffered \"significant damage\" to its hull after the collision with the Philippine-flagged ACX Crystal, will continue its search for the missing sailors in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and elsewhere.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 As the Navy tries to figure out what caused its latest collision, two of the most common theories involve human error or some kind of electrical glitch in the navigation system. But another idea has surfaced as well, and the Navy isn't ruling it out: hacking. \"2 clarify Re: possibility of cyber intrusion or sabotage, no indications right now...but review will consider all possibilities,\" tweeted Adm. John Richardson, chief of naval operations, per Fox News. The idea is that some foreign power, perhaps China or Russia, interfered with the USS John S McCain's GPS navigation, and perhaps did the same before the deadly June collision involving the USS Fitzgerald. Here's a look at what experts are saying: 'Very unlikely': At Popular Mechanics, Kyle Mizokami tosses cold water on the idea that \"GPS spoofing\" is to blame. For one thing, broadcasting such an interference signal would likely have affected dozens of ships in the area, not just the USS McCain, and there's no indication of that. Plus, Navy ships don't rely solely on GPS: Human spotters should have seen the hazard. It's fishy: \"There\u2019s something more than just human error going on,\" a former information warfare specialist for the Navy tells McClatchy, referring to the string of Navy accidents. The story notes that on June 22, hackers appear to have manipulated the GPS signals of 20 ships in the Black Sea, the first such instance of GPS misdirection, or spoofing. The ships' GPSes actually told them they were on land, and the best guess is that the interference came from Russia. It's fishy, take II: \"I don\u2019t believe in coincidence,\" a former member of Israel's cyber-warfare unit tells news.com.au. In addition to interfering with GPS signals, hackers also could have planted malware in the ships' computer network, he says. \"China has capabilities, maybe they are trying things, it is possible.\" The USS McCain had been returning from a patrol in the South China Sea, where it sailed by one of China's contested man-made islands, when the collision occurred. Remains of some of the 10 missing sailors from the USS McCain have been found on the ship itself."

The experts disagreed with former DA Mary Lacy's conclusion that the DNA matched that found on the girl's clothing, that there was. The Bode Cellmark Forensics lab determined that DNA found at the scene of the 6-year-old's murder wasn't from one person but from \"potentially accumulated DNA,\" which could have come from people in the Ramsey family. \"Reproducibility and repeatability is a hallmark of science,\" says one scientist. \"To me, that does raise concern.\"",

Which is what corporate publishers don\u2019t have,\" Spillman explains. \"They have shareholders, and/or parent companies, and must justify their quarterly earnings.\" That's why small publishers are increasingly winning the big literary awards after taking chances on books that the major houses won't touch. \"Random House\u2019s rash deal with Dunham is \u2026 why the corporate publishers are losing cultural relevance, and why they might soon lose solvency as well.\" Click for Spillman's full column\u2014or a column in defense of Dunham's massive deal."

No deaths have been reported. \"This advice includes all types or uses of romaine lettuce, such as whole heads of romaine, hearts of romaine, and bags and boxes of precut lettuce and salad mixes that contain romaine, including baby romaine, spring mix, and Caesar salad,\" the CDC said. \"If you do not know if the lettuce is romaine or whether a salad mix contains romaine, do not eat it and throw it away.\" (Tainted water was blamed in a different outbreak involving romaine earlier this year.)"

Researchers at McGill University report in the New England Journal of Medicine that terminally ill patients who receive palliative chemotherapy are more likely to be younger, married, insured, and more educated than those who don't receive the treatment. They are also less likely to acknowledge their illness is terminal and to have discussed end-of-life wishes with their physicians, reports the Los Angeles Times. \"Our findings underscore the challenge that many oncologists face when discussing the option of stopping chemotherapy with patients and their caregivers, particularly when patients\u2014and physicians\u2014may equate stopping treatment with 'giving up' or 'doing nothing,'\" the researchers write. The researchers looked at 386 adult patients who had at least one chemotherapy regimen but were still terminally ill at the time of enrollment in a longitudinal study of eight outpatient oncology clinics in the US. They found that the more chemo patients received, the more likely they were to undergo cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, or both in the last week of life, Medical News Today reports. The study did not find a difference in survival between those who received palliative chemotherapy and those who didn't. Click for more.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Sad news for cancer patients: A new study finds that those who receive chemotherapy during the end stages of the disease are at a higher risk of enduring a less peaceful death. Of 386 terminally ill patients in a new study, 65% of those who received chemotherapy during the final few months of their life died in their preferred place (for example, at home as opposed to in a hospital). But 80% of those who had chosen to stop treatment died in their preferred location, CBS News reports. Those who continued chemotherapy were more likely to die in an intensive care unit, to undergo CPR, and to be placed on a ventilator. Those who continued treatment were also less likely to have discussed their end-of-life wishes with their doctors. \"There\u2019s a subtle dance that happens between oncologist and patient,\" the lead author explains to the Boston Globe. \"Doctors don\u2019t want to broach the subject of dying, especially in younger patients, because it makes those patients think we\u2019re giving up on them.\" Of the subjects, who died within an average of four months after the study, 56% continued chemotherapy\u2014and they tended to be younger, wealthier, more educated, and more optimistic about their chances of survival.

IRSN researchers say they detected high levels of ruthenium 106, a type of atom that does not occur in nature and is only found when atoms are split in reactors, Reuters reports. The cloud was at its peak during the first week in October and dissipated until it could not be detected in France by Oct. 13, according to IRSN, which says its analysis of weather patterns points to a source between the Ural mountains and the Volga river. The institute, which says other European nuclear regulators have made similar findings, has ruled out the crash of a radioactive satellite or an accident at a nuclear reactor as the source of the cloud. It says the most likely source was either a facility dealing with spent nuclear fuel or a facility for radioactive medicine. Russian authorities say they're not aware of any accident in the area, while Kazakh authorities haven't been reached for comment yet, IRSN says. The institute says the cloud itself is harmless and is unlikely to contaminate food, though it says there must have been a very large amount of ruthenium 106 released at the accident site, enough that would have theoretically warranted an evacuation of a radius of several miles."

That's bad news for both the economy and the deficit, because if the debt ceiling isn't raised, the debt-to-GDP ratio, which measures the amount of money people will have to pay in taxes, will rise, too. \"It's a bad day for the economy,\" says Rep. Darrell Issa, the top Republican on the House panel that oversees the budget. \"If we don't get a deal done, we're going to see an increase in the debt limit and a huge increase in government spending.\"",

Zynga yesterday filed the first salvo of paperwork necessary to obtain an online gambling license in Nevada, the Wall Street Journal reports. But don't expect to be betting on Farmville (or more likely titles like Zynga Poker) anytime soon. The document filed yesterday was a request for the state to decide if Zynga is even potentially suitable for a license, and that decision alone is expected to take 12 to 18 months. It's unclear how long after that final approval would come. The move comes amidst a rapidly changing legal landscape around online gambling. Nevada became the first state to legalize online poker earlier this year. Though it has handed out a few licenses already, none of the companies' online poker games is up and running yet. And when they are, they'll be limited to state residents. But that could soon change: Harry Reid and Jon Kyl are working on a bill that would legalize online poker nationwide and even create an Office of Online Poker Oversight, the Journal reported yesterday. However, the bill would simultaneously ban most other forms of online gambling."

Morgan had been a member of the anti-Communist Escambray Front, one of several groups that supported a Western-style democracy in Cuba at the time. \"I have lived always looking for something,\" he told another gunrunner before heading to Havana. \"We were always outnumbered at least 30 to one.

After the war, Morgan returned to the US, where he became a businessman.

He met his future wife, Olga Rodrguez, in a rebel camp in 1958. She was a poor peasant girl from a poor family living in the central province of Santa Clara who had joined the underground resistance after the Batista regime's. Morgan was a wealthy private equity investor who'd been hired by the British crown to plunder gold from Cuba when it was a Spanish colony.

The judge accused the bank of \"gouging and profiteering\" by changing its policies to process checks, debit card transactions, and bill payments from the highest dollar amount to the lowest, rather than in the order the transactions took place, reports the San Francisco Chronicle. That helped drain customer bank accounts faster and drive up overdraft fees. Wells Fargo adopted the policies beginning in 2001, and they became widespread across the banking industry. The ruling detailed the experiences of two Wells Fargo customers who used their debit card for multiple small purchases, and were then charged hundreds in overdraft fees because the orders the purchases were cleared by the bank depended on the amounts. \"Internal bank memos and e-mails leave no doubt that, overdraft revenue being a big profit center, the bank's dominant, indeed sole, motive was to maximize the number of overdrafts,\" wrote US District Judge William Alsup.

The study found that 1.7% of women knew or suspected their best friend had self-induced an abortion, and 4.1% of women said they'd tried to do so themselves, the Dallas Morning News reports. \"Nobody should be denied safe and compassionate care based on her zip code,\" the president and CEO of Whole Woman's Health, an independent abortion provider in Texas, says. \"But that's exactly what.\" The study, published in the journal Pediatrics, looked at 1,171 women who had abortions in Texas between 2009 and 2013 (the most recent year for which data is available), and found that about half of them ended up having an abortion after taking the drug misoprostol, which is commonly used to induce miscarriages, the Houston Chronicle reports.

Findings of the Texas Policy Evaluation Project are startling: Between 100,000 and 240,000 Texan women ages 18 to 49 have taken matters into their own hands and tried to induce an abortion at home, with, as the Guardian puts it, \"varying degrees of success and differing medical consequences.\" The report asked an online sample of 779 women if they or their best friends had ever tried to self-induce an abortion, with 1.7% saying they had and 4.1% saying their best friend had or they suspected she had, the Atlantic reports. Extrapolating those figures to the nearly 6 million women of reproductive age in Texas is how researchers came to the final numbers, Mother Jones notes. In terms of methods used to attempt an abortion, the drug misoprostol was the most commonly cited, with others including \"herbs or homeopathic remedies,\" alcohol, illegal drugs, hormonal pills, and \"getting hit or punched in the abdomen,\" per the Atlantic. Texas restrictions on abortions are among the strictest in the US: The 2013 HB2 law has shut more than half the state's 41 abortion clinics. The CEO of a gynecology and abortion care organization tells the Guardian that the result is \"tremendously disrespectful. Abortion is legal in this country,\" she says. \"And so every woman deserves to have access to whatever method for terminating her pregnancy safely she might choose in her local community.\" (The Supreme Court will hear arguments over a provision that could leave just 10 or so abortion clinics open in Texas.)"

In May, the NFL banned players from sitting or kneeling during the anthem, but that policy was put on hold in July and won't be enforced as the league and players union try to hash things out on the sidelines."

The girl, Sofia Zago, had been on holiday with her parents at a resort near Venice when she was hospitalized Saturday with a high fever. She died Sunday, the BBC reports. \"It's the first time in my 30-year career that I've seen a case of malaria originating in Trentino,\" says Claudio Paternoster, an infectious diseases specialist at Trento's Santa Chiara Hospital. Since the 1950s, Italy has not had a malaria problem because mosquito-infested marshes were drained. There is speculation that Sofia might have caught malaria from one of two children treated for it at the Trento hospital after 15 August. They had caught it in Africa and recovered. The disease is caused by a parasite that leads to flu-like symptoms. Ninety-nine percent of malaria cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa, where it kills about 3,000 children every day, according to UNICEF. Europe was declared malaria-free in 2015.",

Italy was declared malaria-free in 1970, and the mosquito that carries the disease no longer lives in the country. \"It baffles us how she could have been infected,\u201d NBC News quotes a doctor at a hospital in Trento as saying. Sofia Zago was brought to the hospital on Saturday with a high fever and quickly fell into a coma. Tests showed she had cerebral malaria, the deadliest form of the disease, and she died Monday after being moved to a hospital in Brescia. A doctor says it was the first case of native malaria he's seen in Trento in 30 years. \"It's a mystery, almost impossible,\" the general manager of the provincial health service says regarding the case. Doctors believe Sofia may have been infected during a trip to a beach resort near Venice. It's possible she was infected by a mosquito that had managed to travel to Italy inside of luggage. It's also possible, though very unlikely, Sofia contracted the disease a few weeks ago when she was hospitalized for childhood diabetes. The BBC reports there were two children at the hospital at the same time recovering from malaria they picked up in Africa, though they were in a different ward and Sofia received no blood transfusions. Italy's health ministry has ordered an investigation, according to the AP. While Europe was declared malaria-free in 2015, there have been several individual cases of locally transmitted malaria in recent years, including one in Rome in 2009.

As Bloomberg reported, 60 students have died in frat-related incidents since 2005, a fact \"that is dwarfed by the numbers of serious injuries, assaults, and sexual crimes that regularly take place in these houses,\" writes Flanagan. She chronicles a few incidents, from a freshman girl's heinous rape at Wesleyan University to a young man who fired a bottle rocket out of his butt at Marshall University\u2014and the guy who fell off a deck videotaping it, and later sued Alpha Tau Omega for his injuries. To avoid financial ruin, fraternities have merged into \"vast national organizations\" that buy liability insurance, and they've created rules about alcohol consumption that are nearly impossible for party-lovers to follow\u2014so when the inevitable lawsuits come, frat members are considered at fault for breaking the rules. That means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills, and parents' homeowners insurance often pays settlements. So why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist? Largely because fraternity dorms save schools \"untold millions of dollars\" in housing, writes Flanagan, and the frat-house party image helps lure students into expensive universities. To be fair, advocates also describe the positives\u2014like increased confidence, brotherhood, and leadership training.

Kramer had visited the area with his aunt, and he posted \"wish I could stay\" on Facebook. \"We're focusing on the positive by trying to believe that him saying he needed to be with Mother Earth and set his soul free that he was talking about being out in nature and being one with nature,\" says his dad. Because a week has gone by with no clues, efforts are now being scaled back to rangers and pilots looking for clues when they're in the area, reports San Antonio Express-News. Kramer is described as 5 feet 7 inches tall, 140 pounds, with blue eyes and brown hair. He was last seen in blue jeans and an olive-green sweatshirt. \"We don't know what his plans were. He may be hiking, we just don't know,\" says a Grand Canyon National Park spokeswoman. (A group of 15 hikers was found in California's wilderness just last fall.)"

Sparks from the hot brakes after they landed could have the triggered the fire and it does appear quite dramatic. But they appear to have gotten that under control very quickly,\" he says, per Reuters. \"There don't appear to be any procedural issues here.\""

And the number of Americans who engaged in not a single one of those 104 activities in all of 2014 is more than one in four of us: That's 83 million people, or 28% of the US population over the age of 6, reports the Wall Street Journal. \"We feel confident, in a sad way, that this is the largest number we\u2019ve ever seen,\" says PAC member and Sports and Fitness Industry Association exec Tom Cove, who adds it's the most dismal result he's seen in 24 years. The number of completely sedentary Americans increased by 18% since 2007. That's not to say we don't like the appearance of fitness, just the actuality of it: The Journal notes the rise of \"athleisure\" apparel; such footwear saw sales jump 8% in the year ending April 11, while performance shoes took an 18% dive. The PAC traces the decline to our schools, which help form our lifelong fitness habits and where kids are spending less time in gym class and recess. Another problem? The increasingly cutthroat nature of sports is forcing more casual athletes to the sidelines. Says Cove: \"There are way too many kids who leave sports at age 9, 10, 11, because they simply have to make a decision: Am I going to be a travel soccer kid and devote my life to this, or are there other things that I want to do?\" (An editorial argues that it's not lack of exercise causing an obesity epidemic, it's the food industry's unhealthy products.)"

That's the conclusion of a new study published in Scientific Reports, which looked at the \"secure attachment\"\u2014or lack thereof\u2014of cats between their owners and strangers. The study's participants were split into three groups: one that was left with its owner for six minutes, one that had a stranger stay with it for three minutes, and one that hadn't been left alone for as long as three minutes. Afterward, the cats were tested for signs of attachment. \"The results of our study suggest that the typical bond between a cat and its owner may be much stronger than has been previously reported,\" says lead researcher Daniel Mills in a press release. Previous research has suggested that some cats show signs of separation anxiety when left alone by their owners, \"in the same.\" To test this, researchers had owners bring their cats to a lab that had been set up to look like a house, and then had the cats. When the owners left the room, cats would hide in a box or under a bed while the owner was away. But when the owner wasn't home, the vocalizations of the cats weren't the same as if they were with their owner or a stranger. This study is the first of its kind to test whether a cat's level of attachment is affected by its environment.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 There are a lot of cats in the United States. Perhaps close to 95 million live with us as pets, reports the Times-Picayune. But does our affection for these feline friends move in just one direction? New research in the journal PLoS One suggests that domesticated cats are more independent than dogs because they have less \"secure attachment\" to their owners. In this case, attachment \"is not simply an affectionate bond,\" the researchers write, but relates to \"the carer being perceived as a focus of safety and security in otherwise threatening environments.\" Past research has indicated that some cats whose owners leave them alone display signs of separation anxiety, as dogs do. \"But the results of our study show that they are in fact much more independent than canine companions,\" says lead researcher Daniel Mills. \"It seems that what we interpret as separation anxiety might actually be signs of frustration.\" Behavioral scientists at the University of Lincoln in the UK tested this by observing cats in unfamiliar environments with their owners, with strangers, and alone. They were looking for three distinct characteristics of attachment: the amount of contact a cat sought, its level of passive behavior, and its distress when the owner was absent. Cats were, it turns out, more vocal when their owners left them than when strangers did, but they demonstrated no other signs of attachment, hence the possibility that the vocalization was not one of longing; the researchers posit it could indicate frustration or just be a \"learned response.\" \"Our findings don\u2019t disagree with the notion that cats develop social preferences or close relationships,\" says Mills, \"but they do show that these relationships do not appear to be typically based on a need for safety and security.\" (One woman's attempt to rescue her cat from a cliff didn't go so well.)"

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 In 1999, Luis Vargas was sentenced to 55 years to life for three rapes he didn't commit. Fifteen years later, DNA evidence cleared him of all three, and last month, the Los Angeles Superior Court overturned his conviction, the New York Times reports. Vargas, who was 13 at the time of the attacks, had received a teardrop tattoo as a homeless 13-year-old, according to the California Innocence Project, which helped free him after discovering his conviction was linked to a serial rapist known as the \"Tear Drop Rapist.\" The rapes Vargas was convicted of occurred within a 1.6-mile radius of the three attacks, and all three victims described the attacker as a small, Hispanic male with one or two teardrop tattoos under his eye. His conviction was based solely on the testimony of three victims, who changed their stories over the years. But the prosecution's case was weak, and the defense chose not to offer an eyewitness identification expert. When DNA testing came to light, the DA's office agreed to release Vargas to federal custody. \"I will pray for God's mercy on all of you,\" Vargas told the court before his sentence was handed down. \"But as far as I'm concerned ... an individual really did these crimes might really be raping someone out there.\" Vargas, 46, was taken back into custody when his green card was revoked when his conviction for the crimes was overturned. His daughter tells KABC, \"This is all I've ever wanted, and I thank God for this one because God knows the truth behind all of this.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A California man imprisoned for 16 years for sexual assault was exonerated Monday after DNA tests showed another man committed the crimes, USA Today reports. Luis Vargas, 46, broke down when an LA Superior Court judge granted a petition to release him from his sentence of 55 years to life for three sex crimes. The move came after DNA evidence linked those assaults to a serial attacker known as the Teardrop Rapist, so labeled for having a teardrop tattoo under his eye, the AP notes. That man, who was never caught, is suspected of having committed about three dozen crimes in the LA area. Vargas had matched assailant descriptions, and he caught investigators' eye because he had a faded teardrop tattoo under his left eye and a 1992 rape conviction involving his girlfriend at the time, reports the Los Angeles Times. \"You can sentence me to all the years you want, but ... that individual that really did these crimes might really be raping someone out there,\" Vargas warned a judge before he was sentenced in 1999. In 2012, Vargas reached out to the California Innocence Project and asked to use DNA techniques to examine samples on the clothing of one of his alleged victims, per the Times. The DNA matched that of the victim and the Teardrop Rapist. The three victims had positively IDed Vargas as the perpetrator, but an Innocence Project attorney tells the AP it was a \"shaky witness\" case, an assertion the LA district attorney's office backed up in a recent court letter that said there were discrepancies and uncertainties in their identification of the rapist, the Times notes. Vargas still has to clear up some immigration issues before he's fully released, but he hopes to be home by Christmas."

The organization's study of more than 40,000 items retrieved from ISIS positions in Iraq and Syria, including guns and ammunition, found that many weapons the US government bought from European suppliers were diverted to ISIS, including an anti-tank missile component that was found with ISIS fighters in Iraq just 59 days after it left a Bulgarian factory and was sold to the US, NBC News reports. CAR says around a third of ISIS' weapons were made in the EU. More than half came from China and Russia. \"International weapon supplies to factions in the Syrian conflict have significantly augmented the quantity and quality of weapons available to IS forces\u2014in numbers far beyond those that would have been available to the group through battlefield capture alone,\" CAR said in its report. The report also detailed unusual finds, including a German rifle from 1941 found with fighters in Baghdad, and a cache of 122 Chinese-made machine guns found near Mosul, each with a pouch of amphetamines attached. CAR warns that even though ISIS has now lost most of its territory, it now has the ability to manufacture its own weapons and remains a worldwide threat, Deutsche Welle reports."

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 It's long been believed that Jesus' tomb was located in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, but for centuries historians have wondered whether the site had actually been moved or destroyed. A nine-month restoration of the site, known as the Holy Edicule, has now revealed the tomb's date to be 325 AD, the same time when the Romans were said to have discovered it and built the church around it, National Geographic reports. To date, scientists from the National Technical University of Athens have used radar and laser scanning to date the glue that holds the structure together, as well as ground-penetrating radar and radioactive elements in the glue. \"What it does is, it corroborates our historical accounts,\" says National Geographic archaeology writer Kristin Romey. \"There is so much information in the data that was collected by the restorers during the conservation project. There are many, many stories still to be told.\" The edicule is the size of a coat closet and was open to the public for just 60 hours while the restoration was being carried out. The church is said to be the burial site of Jesus, and the Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and Armenian\u2014\"Obviously that date is spot-on for whatever Constantine did,\" archaeologist Martin Biddle tells National Geographic, referring to Rome's first Christian emperor, who is believed to have built the site where Jesus was buried and laid to rest. Biddle published a landmark 1999 study on the history of the tomb in the church, which was destroyed in 1009 and rebuilt a century later. Researchers dated the cave that Jesus was likely buried; the cave was likely where where where he was buried. \"Where Jesus was or where the body was buried, or, or \"or, or either, or one, or the \"or or either either either or one or a major discoveries have occurred to reveal the cave or the remains of which where where the remains, or which which which could be or the only if either either Either Either EitherEitherEitherEither Either either eitherEither Either Either either or",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Millions of people flock to Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre each year. Many believe it to house the tomb of Jesus Christ, though scientists have thus far been unable to date the tomb to the time when the Romans built a church around it. Now, however, a new series of tests \"corroborates our historical accounts\" as a National Geographic writer puts it to NBC News. It's easiest to understand the significance by understanding the history: Around AD 325, experts believe Roman Emperor Constantine the Great arrived in Jerusalem on the hunt for places linked to Jesus; his team identified the cave that they believed Jesus was buried in and built a shrine (known as the Edicule) to enclose the tomb and then a church around it. That church was destroyed in 1009, recounts National Geographic. It was rebuilt, and all archaeological dating coincided with that rebuilding\u2014proving it was at most about 1,000 years old. The tomb was opened for the first time in centuries in October 2016 to allow for the Edicule to be restored. A marble slab was discovered beneath marble cladding, and mortar samples taken from the slab dated to around AD 345. National Geographic's take: \"While it is archaeologically impossible to say that the tomb is the burial site of an individual Jew known as Jesus of Nazareth ... [the] results put the original construction of today's tomb complex securely in the time of Constantine.\" (Scientists have issued a dire warning about the site.)"

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Scientists have discovered evidence of feathers on the tail of a 99-million-year-old dinosaur\u2014the first time such evidence has been seen in the fossil record, the Los Angeles Times reports. According to a study published Wednesday in Current Biology, the dinosaur's tail was found preserved in semitranslucent amber, which is about the size of a dried apricot. Inside the lump of resin was a 1.4-inch appendage covered in feathers, and CT scans revealed eight vertebrae from the middle or end of a long, thin tail that may have been originally made up of more than 25 vertebrae. Modern birds and their closest ancestors feature a set of fused tail vertebrae called a pygostyle that enables tail feathers to move as a single unit. \" is the sort of thing you've seen if you're ever prepared a turkey,\" study co-author Ryan McKellar says in a press release. Researchers believe the tail feathers belong to a juvenile coelurosaur, part of a group of oviraptorosaurs that includes everything from tyrannosaurs to modern birds. It's believed to be the first known fossil of a feathered dinosaur in the US. The fossil was found in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah, National Geographic reports. \"This means you\u2019re firmly in dinosaur territory, as opposed to bird territory,\" McKellars says. \"The fact that is still present gives us a lot of hope for future analysis to obtain other chemical information things like, like, pigmentation or even to identify parts of the original keratin.\" (Scientists recently discovered a previously undiscovered dinosaur may have the ability to fly.)",

According to the Los Angeles Times, the person selling the amber thought it was some kind of plant. While scientists have found evidence of feathered dinosaurs, not to mention feathered prehistoric birds, this piece of amber is the first time feathers have been found perfectly preserved and attached to what is unmistakably a dinosaur. The find was published Thursday in Current Biology. The tail section is believed to belong to a young, sparrow-sized coelurosaur that lived 99 million years ago. Researchers know the tail belongs to a dinosaur because of its articulated vertebrae; birds have vertebrae that are fused together. And because of the way the features are structured, researchers believe they were useless for flight. It remains unclear exactly what purpose the feathers served, though researchers theorize dinosaurs may have used them for camouflage, regulating their body heat, or signaling to other animals. Now that researchers can see how feathers actually appeared on a dinosaur's body, they hope to learn how they evolved for flight in modern-day birds. They also believe that, given access to Myanmar's amber mines, they may one day find a whole preserved dinosaur."

But it is a serious matter, and we need to discuss it.\" A Vatican official tells the Reporter that in some countries, sisters are forced to leave their congregations when they become pregnant, while priests are allowed to continue their ministry. \"The alternative, as a matter of survival, is to go 'on the streets' as prostitutes and thereby 'expose themselves to the risk of HIV, if not already infected,'\" he writes.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 \"It opened a great wound inside of me. I pretended it didn't happen.\" So says a nun who claims an Italian priest sexually assaulted her while she was confessing to him about 20 years ago in Bologna. A new AP investigation finds she's not alone: Religious sisters are apparently being abused by bishops and priests in Asia, South America, Africa, and Europe, and usually keeping quiet about the assaults. That changed this week when five nuns appeared on national TV in Chile and told their stories of sexual abuse by priests and other nuns, Crux reports. It's an older story in Africa, where reports have emerged of priests abusing nuns and pressuring them into abortions; a six-year study and follow-up report for the Vatican found 29 nuns impregnated at one congregation. The National Catholic Reporter revealed that study in 2001, but what the Church did is unclear. Meanwhile, the Vatican remains quiet on the issue and lacks rules to probe and punish abusers, leaving it to local church leaders to take action. \"Consecrated women have to be encouraged to speak up when they are molested,\" says a Vatican official on the condition of anonymity. \"Bishops have to be encouraged to take them seriously, and make sure the priests are punished if guilty.\" But amid #MeToo and an ever-widening Catholic Church abuse scandal, more nuns may be speaking up for themselves. \"I see it as two freedoms: freedom of the weight for a victim, and freedom of a lie and a violation by the priest,\" says the nun allegedly assaulted in Bologna. \"I hope this helps other sisters free themselves of this weight.\""

Conservation Minister Eugenie Sage says the $4 million project was completed last week. Since the mice arrived on the island on shipwrecks and sealing ships in the 1800s, they have wiped out two species of insect and pushed some sea birds to breed on nearby pest-free islands. Sage says 21 species of breeding sea bird once had 200,000 mice \"preyed on bird chicks and eggs, invertebrates, and plants.\" The mice were likely introduced in 1893 from a ship wreck or \"one of the many gangs,\" the government says. In 2014, New Zealand launched the \"Million Dollar Mouse\" project to raise funds to rid the islands of mice. The public kicked in $250,000, WWF NZ provided another $100,000, and the Morgan Foundation matched donations dollar for dollar. The rest of the funding came from the public and private sectors. A scientist who has spent more than a decade killing off the pests with poison and traps says, \"We're good at killing things, but we'll rely on scientific breakthroughs.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A subantarctic archipelago is making \"huge news\": The New Zealand Herald reports there are officially no more mice on the country's Antipodes Islands, which once housed up to 200,000 of the rodents. They caused a big threat to the World Heritage Site by preying on native birds, bugs, and plants, and the five-year effort to do away with them got an assist from the public, with the \"Million Mouse Project\" fundraising campaign bringing six figures. The Department of Conservation explains that cereal bait laced with rodent toxin was dropped via helicopter on the island during the winter of 2016. A team scoured the island last month looking for any mice and found none. \"This is huge news for conservation both in New Zealand and internationally,\" says New Zealand Conservation Minister Eugenie Sage. She says more than two dozen types of birds, 21 uncommon plants, and more than 150 insect species will benefit. Both Radio New Zealand and NPR note the mice originally found their way to the Antipodes either on 19th-century ships or via a shipwreck and proceeded to purge the island of at least two insect species, as well as to displace some seabirds to other islands. The initiative in the Antipodes isn't a stand-alone: The island nation has also gotten rid of other invasive species in the name of boosting biodiversity, including goats, rats, cats, rabbits, and a local meat-eating weasel. New Zealand's ultimate goal is to rid itself completely of all invasive pests by 2050, per Nature. (Scientists are bashing in the heads of invasive iguanas in Florida.)"

More specifically, the risk for microencaphaly is 1% to 14% depending on the scenario, reports the AP. The range is wide given that research into the disease is relatively new. For the study, scientists analyzed data from 400 babies diagnosed with microcephaly\u2014in which babies are born with abnormally small heads\u2014in the Brazilian state of Bahia between July and February. Because the study focused exclusively on microcephaly in a single Brazilian state, \"these numbers are probably only the tip of the iceberg,\" says a UCLA professor. One notable quirk: the bigger the outbreak, the better the odds are of having a healthy baby\u2014because more women would be exposed before becoming pregnant and perhaps develop immunity. When the outbreak is small, the risk rises to the 14% level. An earlier study out of Brazil put the risk of Zika-related birth defects and fetal death at almost 30%, though one based on a Zika outbreak in French Polynesia put the risk of microcephaly at 1%. But even a 1% risk could be devastating in developing countries, where there are limited care options for disabled children, a health expert tells USA Today. A separate study published Wednesday notes three Brazilian infants with microcephaly showed eye problems not linked to Zika before, including retinal lesions, hemorrhaging, and abnormal blood vessel development, per a release.

His immigration and gun rights platforms have now been joined by his new tax plan, which he announced Monday in a press conference from NYC's Trump Tower, CNBC reports. \"Too few Americans are working, too many jobs have been shipped overseas, and too many middle class families cannot make ends meet,\" notes his site, which boasts four \"simple\" goals to mitigate these issues: offering tax relief to the middle class, simplifying the tax code, growing the US economy, and ensuring the country doesn't add to its debt and deficit. Highlights of Trump's plan include getting rid of income taxes for individuals making less than $25,000 and married couples making less than $50,000\u2014with those qualifying filers receiving \"a new one page form to send the IRS saying, 'I win.'\" (Seriously.) Tax brackets would be whittled down from the current seven to four: 0%, 10%, 20%, and 25% (down from a current high of 39.6%, the AP reports; see where you'd fall on the tax chart shown here). The blueprint also would cut business tax rates down to no more than 15%, as well as levy a one-time 10% tax on overseas profits, which Trump's campaign thinks will encourage corporations to bring money back home, the Wall Street Journal notes. Trump says the tax benefits would be funded by reducing or ending \"redundant\" deductions and loopholes (mostly for the wealthiest, but also in certain cases for middle-class filers), as well as from newly reaped tax revenue from a healthier economy, the AP notes. \"My plan will bring sanity, common sense, and simplification to our country's catastrophic tax code,\" Trump said in an interview with the Journal. \"It will create jobs and incentives of all kinds while simultaneously growing the economy.\" (Read further details about the plan here.)"

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Verizon's new unlimited data plans are here, and they're not great, writes Chris Ziegler at the Verge. \"It's a classic case of a carrier giving you more of what you don't need, and taking away what you do\u2014all for a higher price. I would be fine with the changes if 'Share Everything' was just one of many options, but it's not. For a couple, the new share plan would cost $150 for access to two smartphones, 4GB of data, and unlimited text and voice.\" Existing customers can keep their unlimited plans, but they'll have to give up unlimited data if they upgrade to a new subsidized phone. The access fee for devices is $40 a month, while a basic phone is $30, laptops, Netbooks, and mobile hotspots are $20. Even the lowest rate\u2014 $10 a month for a tablet\u2014seems excessively high. Sprint, meanwhile, is already offering unlimited data on iPads for $80 a month. \"Think of your family and ask yourself: What is easier? Is it better to collect family members under one lump-sum plan or keep them to their own personal data limits?\" writes Jonathan Cheng at ReadWriteWeb. \"That is really what it comes down to.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Verizon yesterday unveiled its new \"Share Everything\" plans, in which families will share one data allowance on a family plan rather than each member having his or her own data allowance on separate plans. Despite the fact that Verizon is touting this as a money-saving opportunity for families, critics run the numbers and say it's actually not: Dan Rowinski of ReadWriteWeb finds that one hypothetical family of four will likely pay exactly the same amount per month, or may save at most $10 per month. The problem? Data may be cheaper under the new plans, but \"you pay more per device,\" he explains. \"Verizon's new plan does not give families a discount. The difference amounts to an administrative change.\" Troy Wolverton goes a bit further in the Mercury News, calling the new plans \"a crummy deal for many consumers.\" He finds that many users will actually end up paying more, since the only real price breaks are on talk minutes and text messages\u2014\"services [consumers] are already using less.\" \"Overall, the move appears to be a price hike tarted up to look consumer friendly,\" he writes. All the critics concede that the new plans are certainly simpler to understand, but on ZDNet, Matthew Miller is \"disappointed that convenience comes at such a high price.\" If Sprint gets its LTE network running, it will be an \"attractive\" option for individual unlimited plans at $80 per phone, he notes. On CNET, Roger Cheng points out that Verizon is now \"forcing\" unlimited voice and text messages with these plans. \"Under the change, customers will have to give up their old grandfathered unlimited data plans right as people use more data than ever,\" he writes. \"It's a classic case of a carrier giving you more of what you don't need, and taking away what you do\u2014all for a higher price.\" The new plans roll out on June 28, and the only way to keep your existing plan is to upgrade to new phones at full cost, with no discount."

Ten years after euro bank notes replaced national currencies on Jan. 1, 2002, the euro has for the first time recorded two consecutive annual losses against the US dollar while plunging to a record low against the yen. That raises the pressure on leaders as they struggle to hold the monetary union together in the face of credit downgrades, European Union splits, and a looming recession that might compound rising debt.

Specifically, the report says the department didn't tell the public that the attack was a protest over an anti-Islam video until almost an hour after it began. The report also says the military never deployed to Benghazi because the Marines had already changed in and out of their uniforms four times as they prepared to deploy, reports the New York Times. Other highlights from the report: Hillary Clinton called an emergency conference call with defense and State Department officials on the night of the attack to discuss how to get Americans out of harm's way, and half of the action items people wrote down in the meeting didn\u2019t have to do with evacuation. \"The administration, including Secretary Clinton, knew that Benghazi was a terrorist attack\u2014from witness accounts, from their understanding of the history of violence in Benghazi,\" writes the Times. \"Yet, they led the public to believe the video and a protest were to blame.\" Rep. Elijah Cummings tells MSNBC the report is \"one of the saddest exercises I've ever engaged in in my 20 years in Congress.\"",

The 800-page report lays out the committee's findings on the 2012 attacks in Libya that left four Americans dead. Here's what you need to know: Benghazi is \"unlikely to be a potent tool for weakening Clinton\" in the general election, as the committee and report have little credibility and aren't seen as serious by many, the Los Angeles Times reports. Easily distilling the massive report, the Washington Post lays out its five \"most serious accusations,\" including that the CIA \"missed warning signs\" and \"misread how dangerous Libya ... was at the time.\" New evidence of \u201cculpability or wrongdoing\u201d on Clinton's part is lacking in the report, despite it being \u201cone of the longest, costliest, and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history,\" according to the New York Times. Given a lack of new evidence against Clinton, the Weekly Standard uses the report as a tool for blaming Obama. \u201cThe Obama administration knowingly provided the American people a false story about the Benghazi attack, its causes, and its consequences,\" the Standard states. How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed. According to the Hill, a Democratic lawmaker on the House Benghazi committee calls it \"one of the saddest exercises I've ever engaged in\" during 20 years in Congress. He accuses Republicans of hiding the final report from Democrats to avoid having it fact-checked. Zeroing in on what it calls the \"most revealing paragraph\" in the report, Vox concludes there's a pattern of spinning \"non-damning facts as damning\" for the Obama administration. The paragraph in question admits there were no US forces close enough to prevent the attack but insists that, in itself, was a failure on the part of the White House. \"I think it's time to move on,\" the AP quotes Clinton as saying after the release of the report, which she says includes nothing not previously discovered by an accountability board."
