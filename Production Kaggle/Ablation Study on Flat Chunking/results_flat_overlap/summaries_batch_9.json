In the letter, Tupac tells Madonna he never meant to hurt her, saying, \"I must apologize to you because like you said I haven't been the kind of friend I know I am capable of being.\" He says he has \"grown both spiritually and mentally\" since their relationship. He also tells her he was hurt by an interview in which she said, \"I'm off to rehabilitate all the rappers and basketball players.\" Auction site GottaHaveRockandRoll.com plans to auction the letter off later this month, with $100,000 as the starting bid.

World leaders and Israeli officials gathered for a state memorial service in Jerusalem, which will be followed by a second funeral service at the Sharon family ranch near the Gaza border where he will be buried next to his wife, reports the Guardian. The Israeli military says two rockets were fired from Gaza just before the service but they do not appear to have landed in Israel, the AP reports. Critics denounce Sharon as a war criminal but funeral speakers including Joe Biden and Tony Blair were full of praise at the Jerusalem service, reports Reuters. Biden paid tribute to Sharon's decision to pull out of the Gaza Strip, while acknowledging that he had serious differences with US leaders. \"The security of his people was always Arik's unwavering mission\u2014an unbreakable commitment to the future of Jews, whether 30 years or 300 years from now,\" Biden said, describing Sharon as a complex man who lived in complex times. \"Arik was never uncertain.

And they were never shy about stating them. Nor was he ever shy about stating his position.\"",

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 President Trump knew that Mike Flynn had misled VP Mike Pence about his contacts with the Russian ambassador weeks before Pence was informed, it emerged Tuesday as the national security adviser's resignation continued to rock the administration. Pence spokesman Marc Lotter tells the Washington Post that the vice president \"became aware of incomplete information\" on Feb. 9 following a Post story on the issue. The White House, however, says Trump and other top administration officials were briefed on the Justice Department's concerns about Flynn at least two weeks earlier. \"It's not that he was being left out. It was a legal review,\" an administration source tells CNN. In other developments: The FBI interviewed Flynn in late January after it warned the Trump administration that he could be blackmailed, the New York Times reports. If authorities determine that he lied during that interview, he could face felony charges. In an interview with the Daily Caller hours before his resignation, Flynn insisted there were \"no lines crossed\" in his conversation with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. \"It wasn't about sanctions. It was about the 35 guys who were thrown out,\" Flynn said, referring to former President Obama's expulsion of Russian diplomats in December. \"It was basically, 'Look, I know this happened. We'll review everything.' I never said anything such as, 'We're going to review sanctions,' or anything like that.\" Legal experts tell Politico that Flynn faces a real risk of prosecution if he wasn't truthful with the FBI, and claiming to have forgotten parts of the conversation probably won't work. Lawyer Mark Zaid says a puzzling aspect of the case is that, as a former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Flynn must have known that conversations with ambassadors from countries like Russia would be under surveillance. Republican senators are among those calling for a full investigation of the Flynn affair, but he still has his defenders, including Rush Limbaugh. On Tuesday, the radio host described pressure on Flynn as a \"political assassination\" by the media, the Hill reports. \"They think they have blood in the water, they've got a scalp, and they think they can get another and then another and then another and then another until finally they get Trump,\" he said. The BBC reports that Pence and other top US officials will be in Europe later this week to reassure American allies\u2014though NATO allies will apparently be untroubled by the departure of Flynn, who was seen as \"a bizarre and destabilizing appointment.\"",

Yet even there, a Temple employee accuses him of drugging her with blue pills and sexually assaulting her.

Scotti says he then paid off the women with money orders using cash provided by Cosby (he produces the money orders). \"He had everybody fooled,\" says Scotti. \"Nobody suspected.\" When Cosby appeared on the Late Show With David Letterman, he asked female staffers to do an odd thing: watch him eat curry, Gawker reports.

Two years ago, Amy Nicholls bought a microscope from eBay seller Med Express. When the microscope arrived, she had to pay an extra $1.44 in postage despite already paying a $12 shipping fee. Med Express apologized for the mistake and offered to reimburse her, but she left a negative review on eBay anyway. Med Express claimed Nicholls' bad review hurt its reputation and sued her for libel. ABC reports the company filed a \"nearly identical\" suit that same day against a second customer, Dennis Rogan, for leaving a \"neutral\" review. The lawsuits, understandably, brought negative attention onto Med Express, and the company withdrew them, ABC reports. Regardless, Nicholls counter-sued Med Express with the help of two lawyers working for free. According to Ars Technica, Med Express agreed to pay $5,500 in legal fees during a trial in 2014 but never did, leading to a second trial. The judge found the company changed its testimony and wasn't credible, ordering it to now pay $19,250 to the two lawyers representing Nicholls. \"We were obviously happy to see that the Magistrate recognized the frivolous nature of the claims,\" according to a statement from the lawyers, who credited Nicholls and Rogan for striking \"a blow in favor of the First Amendment rights of all online commenters.\" (The first item ever sold on eBay was broken.)",

The Sulawesi event was, however, localized, unlike the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. It may have been the case, Patton says, that massive undersea landslides created the tsunami, or that the narrow bay that Palu sits at the end of concentrated the wave's power. Indonesian authorities have been strongly criticized for apparently canceling the tsunami alert too early, though expert Adam Switzer at the Earth Observatory of Singapore tells the AP that this is unfair. \"What it shows is that the tsunami models we have now are too simplistic,\" he says. \"They don't take into account multiple events, multiple quakes within a short period of time.

As Politico notes, Gingrich called the decision at the time a \"great victory for free speech,\" and while he still supports it, he is also complaining about being \"Romney-boated\" by his rival's \"millionaire friends.\" Also: Restrictions needed? The Huffington Post gives banner treatment (\"We've Created a Monster\") to the issue, with Sam Stein writing that some prominent Republicans think that restrictions on super PACs are in order.

Lemmy, as his legions of fans knew him, discovered he had cancer on Saturday\u2014just two days after his 70th birthday\u2014and died on Monday, the BBC reports. The British-born rocker, a former Jimi Hendrix roadie, formed Mot\u00f6rhead in 1975 when he was kicked out of Hawkwind after a drug bust in Canada. \"Our mighty, noble friend Lemmy passed away today after a short battle with an extremely aggressive cancer,\" the band said on its Facebook page. \"We will say more in the coming days, but for now, please ... play Mot\u00f6rhead loud, play Hawkwind loud, play Lemmy's music LOUD. Have a drink or few.\" Lemmy, who made a total of 22 albums with Mot\u00f6rhead, including the 1980 classic \"Ace of Spades,\" rocked\u2014and partied\u2014as hard as anybody in the business, though despite the band's massive influence on thrash metal and other genres, he never cared for the term \"heavy metal,\" feeling more kinship with punk bands like The Damned, reports the CBC. Health problems didn't slow him down much in later years: The band completed a North American tour in September and was due to begin a European one in January. In August, he told the Guardian that death was the only thing that could stop him. \"As long as I can walk the few yards from the back to the front of the stage without a stick,\" he said. \"Or even if I do have to use a stick.\" (We also lost \"Louie Louie\" singer Jack Ely this year.)",

Specifically, the patent titled System and method using foot recognition to create a customized guest experience would scan guests shoes when they enter the park then track them as the move about. According to the Orlando Business Journal, this would allow Disney to track guests' favorite rides and paths through the park. It could also allow them to have Donald Duck greet guests by name or get souvenir photos or videos to them more quickly. The scanners could discern everything from shoe color, to wear patterns, to gum stuck on the sole. Disney filed for the patent back in 2015; it was issued by the US Patent & Trademark Office on July 19. The company, however, says it has no plans to actually use its foot camera patent. A spokesperson tells the Times that Disney files a lot of patents in an \"ongoing effort to relentlessly innovate and push the boundaries of creativity and technology to create immersive experiences and legendary guest service.\" Disney had already decided against biometric scanning\u2014such as fingerprinting, retinal scans, and facial recognition\u2014to track visitors because it considers it too invasive, the Stack reports. Plus those methods can be thrown off by things like hats and sunglasses. The company also didn't want to track clothing because that would \"require cameras that are visible to the person.\" The shoe-scanning cameras throughout the park would be \"out of a person's line of sight.\" (But will members of \"Club 33\" have their photos taken?)",

Pehlu Khan died late Tuesday of injuries sustained when he and 14 other men were brutally beaten three days earlier in Rajasthan state, police said. The men had bought the dairy cows at a cattle fair and were taking them home in neighboring Haryana state when the mob stopped the trucks, pulled out the men, and beat them, said the duty officer at the police control room in Behror town, where Saturday's attack took place. Indian television channels broadcast video of the men being beaten with sticks and iron rods, the AP reports. No arrests have been made. Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a Hindu nationalist, took office in 2014, hard-line Hindus have been demanding that India ban beef sales\u2014a key industry for many within India's poor, minority Muslim community. There has also been a sharp rise in the activities of self-styled Hindu cow-protection groups that stop trucks on highways and attack anyone transporting bovine animals. Rumors of beef eating by Muslims have sparked violence in several places in northern India. About two years ago, a man was beaten to death by a mob over rumors his family had eaten beef, and two others were killed for allegedly transporting cows for slaughter. In many Indian states, the slaughtering of cows and selling of beef is either restricted or banned. The BBC reports that Gujarat state recently enacted the nation's toughest laws on the matter\u2014slaughtering cows there is now punishable by life in prison.",

As comforting as that may be, new research out of Arizona State University is far less so. Whereas researchers previously thought such an eruption would be centuries or millennia in the making, an analysis of fossilized ash left over from Yellowstone's last supereruption 630,000 years ago reveals the process could take only decades. Tiny crystals left over from underground magma at Yellowstone show the first sign of the last supereruption was a spike in temperature that coincided with the movement of new magma into the reservoir beneath the supervolcano. The crystals also reveal a supereruption followed much quicker than scientists previously thought\u2014perhaps within decades, or what Popular Mechanics calls \"a geologic snap of the finger.\" This is the first indication that \"the conditions that lead to supereruptions might emerge within a human lifetime,\" which one researcher describes as \"shocking,\" per the Times.

Discovered in 2017 at the Guatemalan site of La Corona, the nearly 1,500-year-old engraving depicts a king named Chak Took Ich'aak conjuring gods from a shaft shaped like a snake. Ich'aak later governed the nearby city of El Peru-Waka, suggesting that the so-called Serpent Kingdom or Kaanul dynasty forged a movement that grew until it defeated the towering city-state of Tikal in 562 A.D. \"... In this case, around 1,500 years ago, I would call this the historical Mayan version of Game of Thrones,\" excavation co-director Tomas Barrientos tells Phys.org.

Team leader Marcello Canuto sees the dynasty rising up with a mix of cultural appropriation, like conjuring old gods on the tablet to gain legitimacy; marriage, with a princess from neighboring Mexico; and other alliances with powerful forces. Otherwise, beating Tikal \"would be the equivalent to Cuba defeating the United States in a war,\" says Canuto. \"They could only have done that ... if they had had the backing of the Soviet Union.\" Announced Wednesday, the altar is on display at the National Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology in Guatemala City, per the Times-Picayune.",

He also called on countries to stop stockpiling nuclear weapons. Obama said both al-Qaeda and ISIS are still seeking nuclear material for weaponizing, and the risk of nuclear terrorism remains very real. He pointed out recent news that ISIS members had been following a Belgian nuclear plant's senior manager and secretly recording his daily activities. \"We cannot be complacent,\" he said. In addition to ISIS and al-Qaeda, world leaders also expressed concern with North Korea's nuclear weapons program. US officials estimate there is approximately 2,000 metric tons of material worldwide that could be used to build a nuclear weapon, NBC News reports. The US and Russia (Putin refused to attend the summit) account for 90% of the world's nuclear weapons with more than 14,000 nuclear warheads between them.",

David H. Newman, said to be in his 40s (the Times and New York Daily News note he's 45) first came to the attention of police when a woman in her 20s called them Jan. 12 and said Dr. Newman assaulted her the night before. She says Newman entered the private room in the ER where she was being examined for shoulder pain, injected her with morphine even after she told him nurses already had, then groped her and masturbated on her face while she was incapacitated, sources tell the Daily News. After that story broke, a second woman, 22, came forward Sunday and told authorities that during a September visit to the ER for a bad head cold, Newman had groped her breast, the paper notes. An assistant DA said that Newman\u2014who CBS New York said \"showed no emotion\" as he entered the NYPD's Special Victims division Tuesday with his lawyer\u2014must have been carrying around his own supply of morphine, as only nurses are typically given access to the drug, per CBS. \"[Dr. Newman] has been suspended from Mount Sinai pending the outcome of the investigation, and we continue to cooperate fully with the appropriate authorities,\" a statement from the hospital says, per the Times. Authorities want a court order for Newman's DNA to compare to DNA on the hospital gown the shoulder pain victim wore; she says she used the gown to wipe his semen off her face, then stashed it as evidence, the Daily News notes. \"That's horrifying,\" a South Bronx woman who says she's had multiple surgeries at Mount Sinai tells CBS. \"To hear something like that is very scary \u2026 how many other women has this happened to?\" A judge Tuesday night set Newman's bail at $50,000 cash or $150,000 bond, the Times notes.

The officers fired the rubber bullets while trying to clear protesters who were trying to prevent National Police cars from leaving after police confiscated ballot boxes. The Spanish government has ordered police to stop the voting process, saying it's illegal. Catalan officials said more than 300 people were injured, some seriously. Catalan President Carles Puigdemont condemned the crackdown. \"Police brutality will shame forever the Spanish state,\" he said as crowds cheered. Tension has been on the rise since the vote was called in early September, crystalizing years of defiance by separatists in the affluent region, which contributes mightily to Spain's economy. Enric Millo, the Spanish government's rep in the region, said police and National Guard forces acted \"professionally\" to enforce court orders to suspend the vote. He dismissed the vote's validity, saying, \"today's events in Catalonia can never be portrayed as a referendum or anything similar.\" Clashes broke out less than an hour after polls opened. Polling station workers reacted peacefully and broke out into songs and chants challenging the officers' presence. Spanish officials had said force wouldn't be used, but that voting wouldn't be allowed. Regional separatist leaders pledged to hold it anyway, promising to declare independence if the \"yes\" side wins, and called on 5.3 million eligible voters to cast ballots.",

Inflation, he argues, isn't so scary. Rising prices would encourage people to buy now, not later, and it would reduce the \"real\" value of debt. But Bernanke has said that \"would be very reckless.\" He observed that the Fed's inflation goals are a self-fulfilling prophesy\u2014without them, companies would jack up prices. Samuelson sides with Ben, adding that prices could rise faster than wages, hurting spending. \"None of this is preordained,\" Samuelson writes. \"Economists have exaggerated their understanding and control of the economy.

Vox explains the group, which falls to the far right on economic issues, has been feuding with Trump since he announced his run. Though Trump's views on immigration make him seem like a far-right candidate, his promises of \"no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid\" and higher taxes on the wealthy place him closer to the left. \"When Republicans run in primaries with a platform like Trump's, the club tries to take them down,\" reports Vox. \"That's its whole reason for being.\" The Club's president David McIntosh wasted no time in attacking Trump back in June, noting he was \"not a serious candidate.\" But things heated up weeks later when Trump shared a letter from McIntosh asking for a $1 million contribution.

Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups\u2014it's not clear which species is responsible\u2014had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools \u2026 designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)",

Some reactions: Greg Sargent, Washington Post: \"He was clearly out to pick a major public fight with Republicans over tax cuts for the rich. Obama mounted a surprisingly aggressive moral case for ending high end tax cuts, casting it as a test of our society\u2019s priorities, and argued\u2014crucially\u2014that anyone who fails to support ending them is fundamentally unserious about the deficit.\" Larry Kudlow, National Review: \"Basically his message today was class-warfare, soak-the-rich. Somehow, Democrats are for your kids but Republicans are for your fat cats. It\u2019s so tiresome. It will never sell.\" Steve Benen, Washington Monthly: Obama \"did a very effective job at putting Republicans in a box. Either policymakers accept a balance approach, Obama argued, or the GOP will be exposed as deficit frauds who care about protecting the rich at the expense of everyone else.\" Robert Frank, Wall Street Journal: \"Obama has a new term for the people he wants to tax more: jet owners. ... The problem is that most of the people that would be subject to the higher taxes the president wants aren\u2019t likely to be private-jet owners. Someone earning $250,000 a year\u2014among those scheduled for a tax increase in 2012\u2014is unlikely to afford a jet\u2014or even a few charter trips on a jet.\"",

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 An amazing, if grisly, feat continues to resonate after a report in Thursday's Globe and Mail of Toronto. The newspaper, quoting military sources, says a Canadian sniper in Iraq killed an ISIS militant from the mind-boggling distance of 3,540 meters, or 2.2 miles. The Canadian military has not confirmed what would be the longest kill shot by a sniper in history, but the story has in the meantime drawn attention to something else: the remarkable prowess of Canadian snipers in general. Some coverage: The training: If confirmed, that means the sniper record has been broken four times in the last 15 years, three of those times by Canadians, notes Maclean's magazine. One reason, it says, is because Canadian snipers \"are not simply taught to hit their targets.\" The training goes beyond their shooting duties, making sure they're able to \"design and run complex operations\" if necessary. \"That in itself may not make them better snipers but the gestalt of sniper-training and command-thinking combined could explain their skill.\" Long history: The CBC examines the history of Canada's military marksmanship, noting that Cpl. Francis Pegahmagabow of the 1st Canadian Infantry Battalion had 378 kills, making him deadliest sniper of World War I. A military historian says the skill carried into WWII. \"The best snipers were usually country boys who knew how to hunt.\" Official statement: The Canadian military has not confirmed the kill, but it did confirm the shot. \"A member of the Joint Task Force 2 successfully hit a target from 3,540 meters,\" it says in an email to NPR, adding that it won't divulge further details for troop safety. Really? The Globe and Mail says the shot was verified by video and data, but that hasn't emerged yet, and some are skeptical. The Washington Post talks to former US snipers who say that even seeing a human target would be difficult from that distance, even with advanced scopes. A theory floated by a former Marine shooter: \"A spotter with an advanced optical device was able to verbally walk the sniper onto the target and correct his aim.\u201d Yes: Canadian Cpl. Rob Furlong, who once held the record himself at 2,430 meters, counters the skeptics: \u201cIt\u2019s not an impossible distance,\u201d he says. \u201cSo to the naysayers I would just say, this can be done.\u201d It's a \"hell of a shot,\" adds former Canadian sniper Jody Mitic, who was written a book called, of course, Unflinching: The Making of a Canadian Sniper. A critic: In a post at Stuff.co.nz, John Edens thinks the shot was possible, given high-tech gizmos to account for everything from wind speed to the curvature of the earth. Plus, the gun used, a McMillan TAC-50 rifle, employs a 50-caliber bullet the size of a \"large cigar.\" His beef, though, is with media coverage that he thinks glorifies war. \"It's an achievement to a point, but it's not really one humanity should be proud of.\"",

Critics are raving about War for the Planet of the Apes, directed and co-written by Matt Reeves; it currently has an impressive 94% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Here's what they're saying: It's a \"consistently intelligent, morally thoughtful and often beautiful picture\" with a \"coherent and credible\" story that's just as impressive as the action, writes Charles Taylor at Newsweek. He adds the \"special effects are used to support the story rather than supplant it.\" One downside: each scene featuring Woody Harrelson's colonel \"feels strained, not least because this usually terrific actor has been saddled with one of the film's few caricatures.\" But Brian Lowry says Harrelson \"is at his wild-eyed best\" in what he calls \"the summer's best sequel,\" and \"a stirring, soulful conclusion to a trilogy that has brilliantly evolved from its original source.\" This is \"one of those rare instances of a movie billed as a 'climactic chapter' that actually possesses the feeling and majesty of one,\" he writes at CNN, also commending Andy Serkis' intense portrayal of the ape Caesar. Serkis is not only \"brilliant\" but his appearance is \"so lifelike that you forget you're looking at a visual-effects triumph,\" writes Chris Klimek at NPR. The film itself, wrapping up a \"shockingly good series of prequels,\" is \"suspenseful, mournful, grand,\" with \"gravitas and commitment\" that give it \"a place of pride in our current apocalyptic renaissance,\" Klimek adds. Sara Stewart feels \"the imagery and the nonstop horror are a little too heavy-handed.\" But the flick still shines with \"an epic and heartbreaking second half that broadly references the Holocaust, internment camps, refugees and even the Bible,\" she writes at the New York Post. \"Apologies to Charlton Heston loyalists, but War for the Planet of the Apes is a good example of how today's movies sometimes beat the hell out of the oldies,\" she adds. \"It seems wrong to even group them in the same franchise.\"",

Per the AP, the black rhinos died in what Kenyan conservationist Paula Kahumbu calls \"a complete disaster\" after they were relocated from two locations to Tsavo East National Park last month. Officials suspect salt poisoning as the cause, pointing to higher salinity in water sources in their new home. When the saltier water made the rhinos thirsty, they likely drank even more, possibly leading to their deaths, the country's Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife said in a statement. The rhinos were among 11 moved to the park, and officials said the surviving animals are being closely monitored. The planned relocation of other rhinos to the park has been suspended. As the Guardian notes, the Save the Rhino organization estimates the total world population of black rhinos at around 5,500. The species is targeted by poachers who aim to collect their horns for the black market in Asia. Moving endangered animals from one sanctuary to another is called translocation and is done in hopes of establishing healthy populations in new areas. While deaths can and do occur with such moves, officials say a death rate of this magnitude is uncommon.

They now know that they're related to a suspected serial killer. Police say they tracked the suspected Golden State Killer by comparing DNA from one of his many crime scenes to genetic information freely available online, the Sacramento Bee reports. They traced family trees for possible suspects and singled out DeAngelo, a 72-year-old ex-cop, last Thursday. Sacramento County District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert says DeAngelo was placed under surveillance, and DNA collected from discarded items provided \"astronomical evidence\" that he was the killer. Schubert tells the Bee that when she was informed of the DNA test results, \"I probably used a few words I wouldn't put in a newspaper, but basically said, 'You'd better not be lying to me.'\" She adds: \"There were a lot of holy s--- moments.\" DeAngelo was arrested outside his home Tuesday. The San Jose Mercury News reports that investigators used the open-source genealogy website GEDMatch.com to search for the suspect who committed 12 murders and more than 50 rapes between 1974 and 1986. Other genealogy websites, including Ancestry.com and 23andMe, say they weren't contacted by police about the case and that they never provide customer information to law enforcement unless they're legally compelled to. (Neighbors describe DeAngelo as a \"nice old grandpa\" obsessed with lawn care.)",

Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle site should be investigated by California regulators, according to the watchdog group Truth in Advertising. TINA announced on its website this week that it has compiled more than 50 instances of Goop claiming, directly or indirectly, that certain products \"treat, cure, prevent, alleviate the symptoms of, or reduce the risk of developing a number of ailments,\" Fortune reports. Those products, of course, are either sold by or promoted by Goop, but Goop doesn't have the scientific evidence legally required to make such claims about the products, per TINA. The watchdog group has submitted a complaint letter to two of the California Food, Drug, and Medical Device Task Force's district attorneys requesting enforcement. A Goop spokesperson reached out to BuzzFeed (which has helpfully compiled some of the products TINA takes issue with, including a crystal said to treat infertility, hair treatments for depression, and a vaginal egg to prevent uterus slipping) to say that TINA's claims are \"misleading ... unsubstantiated and unfounded.\" Goop was also recently called out by NASA over body stickers supposedly containing spacesuit material, and soon after, a San Francisco OB-GYN made headlines when she called out Goop for promoting the aforementioned vaginal eggs, among other things. In fact, Dr. Jen Gunter's posts about Goop spurred the website to issue a defense, with Team Goop writing: \"As women, we chafe at the idea that we are not intelligent enough to read something and take what serves us, and leave what does not. We simply want information; we want autonomy over our health.\"",

As for this Valentine's Day, \"We'll probably have a nice dinner, a special bottle of wine, and a piece of chocolate,\" he says. \"We're past the craving for jewelry and expensive nonsense. We just enjoy simply being together.\" As for his letter-writing habit, he expresses a single qualm to CBS New York: \"As I get older, my biggest fear is the day I forget to give it to her.\" (One couple's love letters from WWI were recently uncovered.)",

It's unclear what Gorka did to earn the warrant, though he has boasted in the past of regularly carrying two pistols and was stopped trying to carry a pistol through an airport in 2016.

Gorka, a former Breitbart writer, tells the Guardian the warrant is \"more #FAKENEWS.\" On Twitter he responded to coverage of the warrant by saying he moved to the US in 2008. New York notes Gorka didn't necessarily have to be living in Hungary to have been there at some point in 2009. Gorka's actual role at the White House was unclear before he left in August (he claims he resigned, but reports say he was fired by new chief of staff John Kelly). However, it does appear Gorka was wanted by Hungary at the same time he met with that country's foreign minister as a White House adviser, which is, if nothing else, slightly ironic.",

With New Year's Eve approaching, outlets such as Phys.org are reminding people that an extra \"leap second\" will be added to the final day of 2016 in order to keep our earthly time-keeping measures in sync. No, this won't affect countdowns to ball drops\u2014the second is incorporated into the day in far more subtle ways\u2014but if you happened to watch the online clock counting Coordinated Universal Time, or UTC, you'd see the quirk of it going from 23:59:59 to 23:59:60, instead of flipping to 00:00:00. A more technical explanation: \"Leap seconds are added in order to keep the difference between UTC and astronomical time (UT1) to less than 0.9 seconds,\" per the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Wonky, yes, but for companies such as Google that operate Network Time Protocol servers, the leap second is indeed a big deal\u2014and a post at Popular Mechanics praises the company's \"extremely elegant solution\" to the issue. Google will \"smear\" that extra second, as it explains in a blog post. \"Instead of adding a single extra second to the end of the day, we'll run the clocks 0.0014% slower across the ten hours before and ten hours after the leap second, and 'smear' the extra second across these twenty hours.\" Other cloud companies such as Akamai use a similar approach but over 24 hours, notes PCWorld, which expects this longer \"leap smear\" to be standard when the next leap second rolls around, probably in 2018.

Per Yahoo Sports and the Commercial Appeal, Brian Christopher Lawler, 46, was found hanging in his jail cell in Memphis, Tenn., Saturday evening and died the next day. \"Corrections officers administered CPR until paramedics arrived,\" the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation says in a statement. \"Lawler was transported to Regional One Medical Center in Memphis, where he died Sunday afternoon.\" Lawler, who once performed for the WWE as Grandmaster Sexay on the Too Cool tag team, had been behind bars after being arrested on July 7 and charged with DUI, driving with a revoked license, and evading arrest. \"WWE is saddened to learn that Brian Christopher Lawler \u2026 has passed away,\" the WWE said in a statement. \"WWE extends its condolences to Lawler's family, friends, and fans.\" Big names in wrestling also paid their condolences, including Hulk Hogan, who tweeted, \"RIP Brian Christopher thank you for always stealing the show my brother only love HH.\" The WWE also announced the death of \"one of the greatest villains sports-entertainment had ever seen,\" per NBC News: that of Josip Peruzovic, known in the ring as Soviet heel Nikolai Volkoff. The AP reports that the wife of the 70-year-old Hall of Famer, who was once on a tag team with the Iron Sheik, found Peruzovic unresponsive when she went to give him medication he took for heart problems.

If the United Kingdom is to continue applying the 'unacceptable behaviour' criteria to those who wish to enter its borders, it must be fairly applied to the rich as well as poor, and the [powerful] as well as [weak].\" This Scottish David has taken on the American Goliath before. Kelly, a citizen journalist for the Aberdeen Voice, gave Trump a hard time when he was building his Aberdeen golf course a few years back; she's also tried to get the real estate mogul stripped of an honorary degree at a local university, CNN notes. \"The petition will allow all UK residents who want to stand up against \u2026 Donald Trump's hate speech specifically the opportunity to do so,\" Kelly tells the Voice. \"People have been barred from the United Kingdom for less.\" The Metro backs up that claim, citing the banning of both rapper Tyler the Creator and anti-Islam activist Pamela Geller. Meanwhile, a counter-petition entitled \"Don't Ban Trump From the United Kingdom\" has emerged, calling Kelly's arguments \"illogical\"\u2014but that petition had just over 1,600 signatures as of this writing. The House of Commons tells CNN a committee will decide Jan. 5 how to handle Kelly's petition.",

He was joined by chairman Lynn Weidner, president and COO Josh Randle, and board member Tammy Haddad. The resignations of Miss America leadership come after HuffPo published internal emails Thursday that feature Haskell calling a former Miss America winner \"fat and gross\" and joking that he's one of very few people who haven't had sex with her, according to USA Today. He also mused about renaming Miss America winners \"c--ts,\" as per the Hollywood Reporter. On Friday, Haskell was suspended pending an investigation as 49 former Miss America winners signed a petition calling on pageant leadership to resign. Haskell remained adamant that he wouldn't resign over what he said were false accusations and a \"mistake of words.\" In a statement, the Miss America Organization says Haskell's resignation will take effect immediately. Randle and Weidner will stay on for the coming weeks to \"facilitate a smooth transition.\" \"The board thanks Lynn and Sam for many years of tireless work for, and significant financial support to, both the Miss America Organization and thousands of young women,\" the statement reads. In addition, the board says it \"will be conducting an in-depth investigation\" into the emails.",

Their adopted father, 53-year-old Jorge Barahona, was found outside the truck and has been charged with aggravated child abuse for now, reports CNN. The story coming together suggests the twins were adopted by Jorge and his wife and subjected to systemic abuse, including being bound by their hands and feet and forced to stay in the bathroom, reports the Miami Herald. State authorities had two previous reports of something amiss, including one on Feb. 10, but took no action against the parents.

But you're in for a nice surprise. Critics are raving about this spoof on celebrity culture, starring Andy Samberg and a sea of music-industry celebs. Here's what they're saying: It has all the makings of an \"easy-to-watch and enjoyable film. But Popstar is smarter than that,\" writes Anne T. Donahue at the Globe and Mail. \"It's a legitimate look at celebrity culture delivered in a way that's as funny as it is thought-provoking.\" Yes, there are dick jokes\u2014which are \"great\"\u2014but it effectively \"holds a magnifying glass up to the culture that we've all had a hand in creating.\" Fans of the Lonely Island, the name given to the comedy trio of Samberg, Akiva Schaffer, and Jorma Taccone, are in for a \"nonstop party time,\" writes Peter Travers at Rolling Stone. The flick isn't just funny\u2014it's \"insanely funny\" and comes \"with a surprising amount of heart,\" he says, noting \"everyone from Bieber to Kanye gets ribbed in this hilarious mockumentary.\" It's \"a pitch-perfect take satirizing modern-day pop stardom\" and \"front and center, carrying the film, is Samberg in what is easily the most winning film performance of his career,\" writes Richard Roeper at the Chicago Sun-Times. \"It's funny because it gets it RIGHT without ever being too mean-spirited. Even the jokes referencing Anne Frank and Osama bin Laden are good-natured and almost sweet. Almost.\" Ty Burr, however, gives it a 6 or 7 out of 10. He enjoyed the \"sneaky wit of its take on celebrity culture\" and the \"patented Lonely Island music numbers,\" but he found Popstar to be \"genial, silly, and instantly forgettable,\" he writes at the Boston Globe. He was particularly bummed to see Sarah Silverman, Tim Meadows, and Joan Cusack \"get lost in the shuffle.\"",

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 To call it controversial is putting it mildly: Harvard professor Karen L. King in September 2012 debuted an ancient papyrus now known as the \"Gospel of Jesus' Wife\" at a conference in Rome. The papyrus makes an explicit reference to the woman's existence with the line, \"Jesus said to them, 'My wife...'\" Now, extensive testing by professors from Columbia, Harvard, and MIT in the fields of electrical engineering, chemistry, and biology has found no indications that it is a modern forgery, per an article by King published today in the Harvard Theological Review. The Boston Globe says it most likely dates to eighth-century Egypt, and the chemical composition of its ink is in line with the carbon-based inks the people of that country used at the time. But the Globe cautions that a master forger could have accessed the proper materials, and that traditional ink-dating methods couldn't be used because the papyrus is so small: a fragment roughly 1.5-by-3 inches in size bearing just eight incomplete lines (translation here). The Review also published a rebuttal by Brown Egyptology professor Leo Depuydt, who points to \"gross grammatical errors\" he says no native speaker of Coptic would make, the New York Times reports. (More criticism of the papyrus here.) The new findings certainly don't prove that Jesus was married, a point that King has never challenged; she'd like to see the debate shift to discussions of the document's significance, and \"questions like, 'Why does Jesus being married, or not, even matter?'\" King was in 2011 asked to review the fragment at the request of its anonymous owner, who says he bought it more than a decade earlier from a collector who said he purchased it, along with five others, in East Germany in the '60s.",
