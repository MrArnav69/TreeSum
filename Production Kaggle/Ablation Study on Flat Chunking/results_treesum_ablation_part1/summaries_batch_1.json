The identities of special forces personnel can be classified, and making them public is against the law. The investigation was launched in September by Republican Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, who wants to see the full report before drawing any conclusions. \"I\u2019m not looking for anyone to be indicted,\" he said yesterday. \"But the IG does not make referrals to theJustice Department as a matter of routine.

The Pentagon says its investigation into possible leaks related to the film is still ongoing. It was launched at Rep. Peter King's request, but his office hadn't been notified of any findings by this week. King says that \"raises the question\" of whether the delay was for political reasons.

Spinal Solutions founder Roger Williams got kickbacks in the form of free plane rides and consulting contracts from doctors who wanted to sell the company's products.

Williams allegedly wooed doctors via lavish vacations, Lakers seats, and containers full of cash. There's no evidence doctors were complicit in the reported counterfeiting, but plenty of them used the screws.
