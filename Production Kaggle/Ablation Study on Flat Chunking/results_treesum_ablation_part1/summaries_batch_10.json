The official said the strike was an \"act of self-defense,\" not an act of war. It was the first time North Korea launched a ballistic missiles over Japan. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called it an \"unpre\u2014North Korea's missile launch over Japan early Thursday is being described as a very real threat to the country and its people.\" Residents were warned to take cover in buildings or underground after the intermediate-range missile flew over northern Japan for two minutes before crashing into the Pacific Ocean, the Guardian reports. Sirens blared as the missile passed overJapan. \"I woke up with a Siren and an announcement that North Korea launches a missile that would possibly hit cities within Hokkaido,\" tweeted one resident. \"If you find suspicious objects, please don't go near them and immediately call police or firefighters.\" The missile appears to have malfunction; the New York Times describes it as a \"direct challenge\" to President Trump, who warned earlier this week that the US is \"locked and loaded\" if it is attacked by Pyongyang.", "reference_summary": "\u2013 \"Are we really willing to risk Los Angeles or Chicago in retaliation for an attack on a US military base in the region? Probably not,\" nuclear strategy specialist Vipin Narang tells the AP. And that's exactly the calculation that gives North Korea a small shot at \"winning\" in a nuclear conflict, challenging the assumption that launching a nuclear weapon would be automatic suicide for the country. If North Korea feels threatened to the point of using a nuclear weapon, a first target would likely be a US military base in Japan; North Korea would then use its long-range nukes to threaten the US mainland and avoid a retaliatory strike. Experts say this is Kim Jong Un's \"theory of victory\"\u2014one that President Trump may be attempting to combat with an unsuccessful version of the \"madman strategy.\" Here's what else you need to know about North Korea's most-recent missile launch: Tuesday's missile launch over Japan seems likely to result in even more sanctions against North Korea. But after UN sanctions Aug. 5 targeted millions of dollars in seafood, coal, iron ore, and more, is there anything left to sanction? CNN reports two options are oil and Chinese banks. After Tuesday's missile launch, Trump said \"all options are on the table.\" This was, all things considered, a \"measured\" response from the president, according to the Atlantic.

Korea expert Stephan Haggard tells the Washington Post that Tuesday was another example of how \"weirdly conservative\" Kim Jong Un is\u2014carrying out provocative actions with just enough restraint to avoid an actual response. For example, pointing the missile toward Japan, not Guam.

That's similar to the results of previous studies showing a link between potato consumption and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes in later life. \"This is the first time we've seen this association,\" says the lead author of the study, published in the British Medical Journal. \"What we do know is\u2014Women who eat an awful lot of potato are more likely to develop gestational diabetes.\" The reason isn't clear, but researchers say potatoes have a high glycemic index, which is linked to a spike in blood glucose levels after eating them, CBS News reports. \"Potatoes elevate blood sugar in people more than just about any other type of food,\" says one doctor. \"They are carbohydrates, and all carbohydrates have that potential.\"", "reference_summary": "\u2013 If your short-term plan involves getting pregnant, your immediate plan should potentially be to lay off the potatoes. So suggests a National Institutes of Health study published Tuesday in the BMJ that found women who eat more potatoes before becoming pregnant may be more likely to develop gestational diabetes as compared to their spud-light counterparts. That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap. The researchers estimate that trading two servings of potatoes weekly for a substitute vegetable, legumes, or whole-grain food would reduce the risk of gestational diabetes\u2014which CBS reports affects as many as 8% of pregnancies\u2014by 9% to 12%. As for why women should care, Zhang tells the BBC that women with gestational diabetes can develop pre-eclampsia and hypertension, which \"can adversely affect the fetus\" and put the mother at higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.

The left and right hemispheres of the bat's auditory cortex work in tandem to make certain sounds sound like each other.

The Telegraph reports the extinction of mammals, birds, and amphibians has happened up to 100 times faster than the normal rate during the past six mass extinctions\u2014the most recent being the Permian mass extinction 66 million years ago. Humans are responsible for the loss of 77 mammal species, 140 bird species, and 34 amphibians. \"This is very depressing because we used the most conservative rates, and even then they are much higher than the regular extinction rate, really indicating we are having a massive loss of the species,\" Dr. Gerardo Ceballos of the National Autonomous University of Mexico tells the Guardian. The study looked only at species that had been declared extinct, meaning it could take years after a species to return to existence. \"These estimates reveal an exceptionally rapid loss of biodiversity over the last few centuries, indicating that a sixth mass extinction is already under way,\" the study's lead author says in a press release. If current trends continue, 1,508 vertebrate species could go extinct in the next 100 years, and another 4,400 by the end of the century, say researchers from Stanford, the Smithsonian, and elsewhere. That's about 2.3% of the world's vertebrate species, or about the same as the rate at which all other animal and plant species have gone extinct. \"The particularly high losses in the last several decades accentuate the increasing severity of the modern extinction crisis,\" says Ehrlich, who was not involved in the study.", "reference_summary": "\u2013 Feeling upbeat? Enough of that: Planet Earth is undergoing a sixth mass extinction that will likely annihilate the human race unless we can curb the trend, scientists say. According to a new paper, the current rate of species extinction outpaces the natural rate far more than anyone knew, NBC News reports. The analysis \"employed better knowledge\" of Earth's natural extinction rate, the Guardian reports, upping the number from one extinction per million species annually to two extinctions. It then compared that to a current extinction rate that study authors consider conservative. Presto, they got a rate since 1900 that's eight to 100 times worse than the natural one. \"We were very surprised to see how bad it is,\" says study leader Gerardo Ceballos. \"This is very depressing.\" \"If it is allowed to continue, life would take millions of years to recover, and our species itself would disappear early on,\" says Ceballos. But nations can reverse the crisis\u2014which has been linked to deforestation, industrialization, and other human factors\u2014by conserving threatened species and lowering pressures on their populations, the paper says. So far critics seem to buy the paper's basic math but doubt that species extinction will continue at this high rate for centuries. \"It is likely the problem will decline rapidly because most countries will be rich and care much for the natural world,\" writes one environmentalist.
