Police say the girl had a cellphone she could use to call her mother in case of emergency, and on the third day of her stay at the park, someone asked where her mom was. The girl said her mom, McDonald's worker Debra Harrell, was at work. Her daughter is now in the custody of social services.

At Salon, Tracy Clark-Flory writes that by arresting this mom (presumably causing her to lose her job) and putting the child far more trauma than she was ever likely to suffer in the park ... \"even if the state felt it had the right to declare this parenting decision impermissible, couldn't they have given this woman a simple warning before taking custody?\"", "reference_summary": "\u2013 Should sending your kid to play alone at a local park land you in jail?

When the parents of other children at the park found out, they called police, who arrested Harrell and charged her with unlawful conduct toward a child. The daughter has been placed in state custody. Local news outlets first reported the story on July 1, but it's been getting wider attention lately thanks to an indignant post on Reason from \"Free Range Kids\" advocate Lenore Skenazy. And so far, pretty much everyone agrees that the arrest is senseless and wrong.

One law professor tells Grose that the statutes for child welfare laws are often broadly written, giving police lots of latitude\u2014and allowing \"race, class, and gender biases to influence decisions.\" That could be the case here, because Harrell is black, and her poverty helped cause the situation. \"The story is a convergence of helicopter parenting with America\u2019s primitive family policy,\" writes Jonathan Chait at New York. \"Our welfare policy is designed to make everybody, even single mothers, work full-time jobs. The social safety net makes it difficult for low-wage single mothers to obtain adequate child care.

On Thursday, that court order was overturned in a unanimous decision by the California Supreme Court that animal activists are decrying. A Los Angeles County Superior Court judge issued the injunction against the zoo in 2012 in response to a taxpayer lawsuit alleging animal cruelty. But in what the Los Angeles Times calls a \"highly technical ruling\" overturning the injunction, the state's highest court said a taxpayer lawsuit (which uses civil law rules) can't be used to address criminal conduct. The taxpayer lawsuit began in 2007 when an LA resident sued over what he said was abusive treatment of the elephants, also including the use of chains and drugs, Courthouse News Service reports. A lawyer who worked on the case, for free, for more than five years says he'll attempt to find another way to get a similar injunction against the zoo, or request that the state legislature overturn the ruling. \"I thought we had done something here to move the ball forward and instead the Supreme Court has allowed the zoo to take a step into the Dark Ages,\" he says. The Supreme Court explained in its ruling that by obtaining the injunction in such a way, the court did not allow the zoo to have a jury trial or the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The barbed sticks known as bull hooks have since been banned entirely in California, and for its part, the zoo says that it has never used and will never use them or electric shocks as disciplinary tools for its elephants, and that it will continue to follow the court order despite it being overturned.", "num_chunks": 2}, {"sample_idx": 4562, "generated_summary": "\u2013 Elon Musk's wife is praising the Tesla CEO after he pulled over to help a couple whose car spun out in traffic.

The updated Red List, released Thursday at a biological diversity conference in Cancun, Mexico, points to man as the main driver of the declining stats, with poaching, habitat loss, and local unrest all assuming partial blame. A Duke University conservation biologist says the IUCN is partly to blame, too, for not considering more species threatened. \"There's a strong tendency to think that familiar species [such as giraffes, chimps, etc.] must be OK because ... we see them in zoos,\" he tells the AP. \"This is dangerous.\" Some good news, at least for some long-neckers: Of the nine giraffe subspecies, three of them are experiencing increasing populations; one is stable.
