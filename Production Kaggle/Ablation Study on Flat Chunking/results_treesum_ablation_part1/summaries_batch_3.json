That anecdote kicks off Politico's behind-the-scenes look at the crisis. The Wall Street Journal has one too\u2014with different bits of insider gossip. Here are the most interesting tidbits from both: Obama and Harry Reid decided on their no-negotiation strategy over the summer, believing that Boehner could never unite his fractured caucus behind anything. Republicans never believed the pair would stick to it. Boehner and Reid initially struck a deal in which Boehner would pass a sequester-level budget with an ObamaCare-defunding rider that the Senate could simply strip out. Boehner assumed\u2014incorrectly\u2014that his caucus only wanted a show vote. Boehner's former chief of staff was feeding the White House intelligence, telling it that Boehner would have to fight up until the debt ceiling deadline. Reid also took to monitoring Twitter for hints on the GOP's next move\u2014a sign of how badly communication was flowing. Many Republicans turned to Joe Biden, hoping he would intervene. Biden told them he'd been \"sidelined \u2026 at the direction of the president,\" one rep says. Reid, bitter about the fiscal cliff deal Biden negotiated, had wanted him out. At one point, Boehner brought up the idea of a \"grand bargain\" at a White House meeting; Reid laughed in his face. When Paul Ryan joined the fray at an Oct. 10 meeting, he told Obama that he would \"miss his moment\" and derail his whole term if he didn't strike a deal. But he also made what White House aides called a \"Freudian slip,\" saying, \"We\u2019re going to have six weeks to negotiate the debt limit.\" That night, aides to Boehner, Cantor, and Obama began talking about a broader budget deal, and agreed to talk more in the morning. The White House never called. When Mitch McConnell finally decided he had to broker the deal, he partnered with Lamar Alexander\u2014angering Susan Collins, who had worked far harder on the process, only to see her own deal torpedoed. McConnell picked Alexander because he had better conservative credentials, and was pals with Reid confidante Chuck Schumer. Alexander and Schumer brokered the deal behind the scenes, then passed it off to Reid and McConnell. McConnell tells the Washington Post that he saw himself as a backup quarterback thrown into the game. \"I felt like I was on the two-yard line, I had a pretty weak offensive line, and the best I could hope for was to try to punt.\" Boehner made one last-ditch attempt to pass an alternative. \"We're running out of time,\" he told his caucus. \"Your 'no' vote has consequences.\" But as Reid and Obama had predicted, he couldn't convince them.

The court didn't rule on the specifics of the case, but it did say that the rules violated Section 706 of the Communications Act, which requires the FCC to regulate the Internet. Without net neutrality, Internet service providers can discriminate against certain types of traffic\u2014like streaming video or peer-to-peer file sharing\u2014and make more money at the expense of everyone else, writes Troy Wolverton at the San Jose Mercury News. \"Right now, America\u2019s broadband is slow. It\u2019s slow because ISPs can already make gobs of money by charging the rich a ton for high-quality Internet while leaving the rest of America with subpar (or no) service,\" he writes. \"Thanks to the ruling, broadband providers can now exert a lot more control over what sites you visit on the Internet and what services you can access.\"", "reference_summary": "\u2013 Yesterday was the day net neutrality died, with a court ruling that Internet service providers aren't bound by FCC non-discrimination rules\u2014so they can prioritize some traffic over others.

Among their warnings: The Wall Street Journal reports that the decision could have a huge impact on sites like Netflix and YouTube, whose video services hog a lot of bandwidth (they account for 32% and 19% of peak web traffic, respectively). If ISPs start making Netflix, for instance, pay a usage fee to maintain speedy content delivery, that cost could make a serious dent in its profits\u2014or trickle down to consumers. ISPs could charge sites big fees in exchange for faster content delivery, potentially giving giants who can pay, like Amazon, a big leg up over independent retailers\u2014not to mention other small businesses, the Huffington Post notes. Providers might even go so far as to prioritize traffic to partner sites\u2014Time Warner might push CNN, for example. Another anti-competitive fear, via BuzzFeed: Big companies might start paying your data fees for the use of their sites. That might sound good\u2014free data?\u2014but it would mean that companies with the ability to pay would have a major advantage over start-ups in winning users. As BuzzFeed points out, \"If, in this future, you're choosing between two streaming music services, and one of them pays for your data, there's a very good chance you\u2019re going to pick that one.\" Beyond concerns over fees, there are worries that providers could block certain websites completely: Comcast users could theoretically end up with no access to, say, Netflix or Vonage, writes Troy Wolverton in the San Jose Mercury News.

A group called Safe Streets has filed suit on behalf of 10 residents who say Colorado's law classifying marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug violates their First Amendment rights. The lawsuit argues that since marijuana is still illegal under federal law, Colorado is violating the 14th Amendment by allowing its marijuana to be sold in places where it's already banned. The states also say the law is causing a rise in marijuana trafficking across state lines. Since Colorado legalized marijuana last year, crime rates are down, marijuana use among teens hasn't increased, and the state has taken in around $60 million in taxes and fees.

This isn't the first group to take legal measures against the state. The attorneys general in Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit against Colorado last year, saying the free flow of pot across state lines is hurting communities. \"Left unchallenged, I am confident Colorado's law will cause long-term harm to Nebraska families,\" that state's AG, Doug Peterson, wrote in an open letter, as per the LA Times. And two lawsuits filed last month by an anti-drug group express similar complaints and add racketeering charges into the mix, the Huffington Post noted in February.
