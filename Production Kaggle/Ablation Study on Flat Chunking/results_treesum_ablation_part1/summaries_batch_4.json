Daniel Deguzman was hospitalized last month with acute flaccid myelitis, or AFM, and died Monday, two days after he was taken off life support, KIRO 7 reports. He's believed to be the first death in the state related to the illness, which affects the nervous system and can cause weakness or paralysis in one or more arms or legs. Nine kids between the ages of 3 and 14 have been admitted to Seattle Children's Hospital with AFM in Washington state since July, the hospital says, all but one had lost some strength in one arm or leg. AFM is rare, occurring only about once every 100 years, and it's not contagious, CBS News reports. Symptoms can include fever, chills, fatigue, loss of muscle tone, and pain in the joints. According to the CDC, AFM is caused by a virus, and there's no treatment for it. \"If a child or adult is experiencing any kind of weakness at all, they should see their health care provider immediately,\" an Oregon Public Health Division spokesman says.", "reference_summary": "\u2013 It was a quiet 2015 after dozens of people, mostly children, fell gravely ill in 2014 from a mysterious condition called acute flaccid myelitis, which first presents as a cold but quickly escalates to polio-like symptoms, including paralysis. It is quiet no longer as the Centers for Disease Control confirms what appear to be about 90 cases across 33 states so far this year, and three of them are in Oregon, home to the first case in 2014, reports the Oregonian. Washington, which saw only a couple cases in 2014, appears to be suffering from something of an outbreak, with nine cases so far this year including the first suspected fatality; a 6-year-old boy is believed to have died from the illness, reports MyNorthwest.com. The illness is not contagious, according to doctors, but it's not clear how people contract it. Little is known about AFM, though it's been linked to enteroviruses as well as West Nile and related viruses, and there is no treatment other than comfort care. It affects the nervous system, particularly the spinal cord, and telltale symptoms include weakness and paralysis. \"If a child or adult is experiencing any kind of weakness at all, they should see their health care provider immediately,\" Oregon's public health division spokesperson tells KATU.
