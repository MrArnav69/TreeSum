According to an arrest affidavit released Tuesday, Lindquist had offered his father's guns to a man in exchange for drugs, so long as the man staged the scene to look like a burglary. That's not what happened. Now charged in the case, 23-year-old Ruth Correa reportedly told police her brother, Sergio Correa, hit Lindquist in the head with a machete after Lindquist panicked, per the Washington Post. The siblings then stabbed Lindquist, leaving his body in the woods near his parents' home, which they entered through a basement door they knew to be unlocked, per the affidavit. When Kenneth and Janet Lindquist appeared, 26-year-old Sergio hit Kenneth, 56, with a baseball bat while Ruth told Janet that \"her son had set her up,\" the affidavit states, per NBC Connecticut. The document says Sergio then choked Janet, 61, and hit her in the head with the bat before he and his sister set the house alight and took off with stolen goods and Matthew Lindquist's car, later found burned. After reportedly telling police that her brother might be planning to kill her, Ruth Correa was arrested on charges of murder, home invasion, arson, and robbery on May 12, a week after Matthew Lindquist's body was found. At the time, police said additional arrests were expected. Sergio Correa has yet to be charged, though.

That's according to a study published Wednesday in Climatic Change that looked at 20 of the world's busiest airports, including New York's LaGuardia and Paris' Charles de Gaulle. The study found that on the hottest days, fuel capacities and payload weights will have to be reduced by as much as 4%, which would mean about 12 fewer passengers on an average 160-seat plane, reports the Los Angeles Times. The problem is that thinner air means less lift as a plane travels along a runway. This can cause a plane to be unable to takeoff safely. \"All the published studies have been about thing getting worse,\" an expert at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research tells the New York Times. \"Our results suggest that weight restriction may impose a non-trivial cost.\" The most affected airports in the study are in the Middle East, including Dubai and New York\u2019s LaGuardia, though London\u2019s Heathrow and Paris\u2019Charles de Gaulle were also considered safe. The researchers looked at five common commercial airplane models, including the Boeing 737-800, Airbus A320, Boeing 787-8, Boeing 777-300, and Airbus A380. They calculated how their takeoffs would be affected at 19 airports around the world based on projected temperatures from 27 different global climate models. The good news is that London, Paris, and JFK in New York will be able to shrug off future heat waves, but other sectors of the economy could suffer delays and cancellations.

A new study suggests stories like that will become quite common in the not-too-distant future. Via Reuters, the study published in Climatic Change estimates that rising temperatures could leave up to one-third of planes grounded during heat waves in the coming decades. The problem centers around the wings\u2019 capacity for lift, which is lessened in warmer conditions. By 2100, worldwide average temperatures are expected to rise by 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit. To safely take off, airlines would need to make adjustments during the hottest part of the day, with 10% to 30% of planes affected. Full flights will either stay grounded until conditions cool down or lighten their loads by removing fuel, cargo, or passengers, per a release at EurekAlert. Think 12 to 13 people asked to leave a 160-person passenger plane. \"Our results suggest that weight restriction may impose a non-trivial cost,\" one of the study\u2019s lead authors says.
