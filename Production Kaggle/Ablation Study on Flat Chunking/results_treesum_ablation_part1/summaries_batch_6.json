It may sound like an obvious chain of events, but it remains unclear why two patients given the same opioid prescription after similar complaints have different addiction risks depending on their ER doc. The takeaway is \"not that high-intensity prescribers are necessarily irresponsible in prescribing opioids to certain patients,\" the lead author tells the New York Times.
