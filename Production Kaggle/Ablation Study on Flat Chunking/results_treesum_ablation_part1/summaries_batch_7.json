The report states insurers and Medicaid programs in 27 states limited or banned access to Sovaldi because they feared it would be too expensive to treat so many people. \"The documents show it was always Gilead's plan to max out revenue, and that accessibility and affordability were pretty much an afterthought,\" says Sen. Ron Wyden, who co-led the investigation with Sen. Chuck Grassley. Gilead responded to the report with a statement saying the price hike was \"in line with previous standards of care\" and that more than 600,000 people are treated with Sovaldi. Harvoni, a treatment that costs $94,500, was also approved for Sovaldi in December 2014 and is now the most expensive hepatitis C treatment in the world, reports the New York Times.

Gilead Sciences, the sixth richest drugmaker in the world, \"is making a fortune selling essential drugs to the very government and taxpayers that helped pay to develop them, and then dodging taxes on the resulting profits,\" says Frank Clemente, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, which issued the report this month. Gilead has avoided some $10 billion in taxes by moving assets to Ireland, where there is a lower tax rate, and then not bringing some $28.5 billion in profits back into the US. Per the Washington Post, the California-based company's revenues in 2015 hit $32.6 billion, up three times from 2012. As for the accusation of gouging: Last year, a Senate investigation found that the company \"pursued [a] profit-driven strategy\" with its hepatitis drugs, rather than making the drugs more accessible at a lower price (it had considered $50,000). As the Post notes, Gilead, which declined to comment on the report, isn't alone in looking overseas for tax relief. Plenty of other pharmaceutical and technology companies do it. Apple, for instance, has squirreled away nearly $200 billion abroad, Bloomberg reported last year. According to Citizens for Tax Justice, that's enabled the company to avoid paying $59.2 billion in US taxes. Pfizer has some $193 billion abroad, per the Post.

The study looked at 32 pole-vault injuries that were reported to the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research between 1982 and 1998. Of those, 17 (53%) involved athletes landing on the landing pad and their head on the ground; eight (25%) landed in the vault box after being stranded at the height of the jump, and five (16%) completely missed the landing pads; and a thoracic spine fracture resulted in a paraplegia. The injuries occurred in male athletes between the ages of 17 and 17.5, and 31 of them resulted in catastrophic head injuries. The most common type of injury was a traumatic brain injury, which was caused by a \"significant increase\" in the amount of force applied during the jump. The researchers recommend increasing the minimum landing pad size to 25 feet, and enforcing the rule requiring soft surfaces next to the landingpads to prevent injuries. In fact, one-third of lumbar injuries were season-ending, and the odds of injury were 2.7 times greater for vaulters with multiple prior injuries.

A follow-up study published in 2012 noted that one safety-related change made in 2003 was an expansion of the landing pad's minimum dimensions.

And a study of collegiate pole vaulters published this last January found 41% sustained some kind of injury, a figure that researchers saw as suggestive of the fact that \"injuries are very common in experienced vaulters.\" The injury stats aren't good, and the potential pay and fame aren't much better. So why the heck do it?

They say they've found underwater craters off the coast of Norway that are likely the result of \"enormous blowouts of gas,\" the Telegraph reports. The gas could turn water beneath the craters into foam, which could cause ships to sink suddenly. But it's not clear whether the gas blowouts happen in the Bermuda Triangle area, or how they would make planes vanish from the sky, the Guardian notes. The theory stems from surveys of the ocean floor between Britain and continental Europe that have revealed large quantities of methane hydrates, an odorless gas found in swamps and mines. As the methane deposits rise, they become gaseous, and huge bubbles form at the surface. \u201cWhether or not the ship will sink depends on its position relative to the bubble,\u201d write the researchers in the Journal of Adolescent Health.

The stem cells were created in the lab from the donor skin of a monkey who was a good genetic match for the recipient. The hope is that the heart cells will not be rejected by the immune system, but the procedure is time-consuming and expensive. Currently, patients who suffer a heart attack can receive a heart transplant, but there are not enough donors. The new study shows that using stem cells could be a much more cost-effective option.

The procedure could lead to a new way to treat heart attacks and at least partially repair heart damage, the Guardian reports. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men and women in the US. Scientists are intrigued by the idea of treating damaged hearts by using a patient's own skin cells to create healthy heart cells, which are less likely to be rejected since they don't come from a donor. In the latest study in the journal Nature, the team at Shinshu University induced heart attacks in five macaques and then injected them with heart cells made from the skin of a healthy macaque who was a close genetic match. To avoid rejection, they ensured the donor monkey had a type of protein similar to the recipients' and they gave the sick monkeys anti-rejection drugs.

The scientists were able to overcome that by using an enzyme to break down the scar tissue, in tandem with a growth factor that helped the transplanted nerves grow. \"This is one of the most important steps that I have seen in recent years,\u201d says an Oslo neuroscientist not involved with the study.", "num_chunks": 3}, {"sample_idx": 2175, "generated_summary": "\u2013 When a dad couldn't afford to buy his 2-year-old daughter a seat on a plane, an airline agent stepped in\u2014and paid for the ticket, CBS News reports.

Each subject watched 10 total videos, four each featuring warm and cold water with different actors who used either their left or right hand, as well as two control videos.

The heart rate of the viewers didn't change, and neither hot or lukewarm videos produced similar results.

According to court documents, the man grabbed the girl, pulled her into a yard, and raped her. He allegedly used a garden hose to clean the evidence of the assault and forced it in the girl's vagina to do so. They drove to a McDonald's and back to Bolar's house, where they said the girl was not allowed to leave and he would find and kill her if she did. He raped and beat the girl and forced her to clean his house throughout the next two days, police say.
