The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep.

In a blog post, Musk says he decided to make a public announcement last week because he wanted to be \"completely forthcoming\" with Tesla's largest shareholders. \"However, it wouldn't be right to share information about going private with just our largest investors without sharing the same information with all investors at the same time,\" he writes. Musk says his \"best estimate\" is that \"approximately two-thirds of shares owned by all current investors would roll over into a private Tesla.\" He adds that Saudi Arabia's $32 billion investment fund has expressed support for the plan, but details are still being worked out. Tesla shares rose 4.4% in after-hours trading Monday following a tweet from Musk saying he had secured funding to take the company private.

Musk said he had hired two financial advisers and two legal advisers and is \"excited to work with\" them on the proposal. \"If and when a final proposal is presented, an appropriate evaluation process will be undertaken by a special committee of Tesla\u2019s board, which I understand is already in the process of being set up, together with the legal counsel it has selected,\" he wrote. \"I am confident that Tesla will deliver on its mission of making cars safe and environmentally friendly.", "reference_summary": "\u2013 It sure has been an interesting week for Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and things might get worse before they get better.
