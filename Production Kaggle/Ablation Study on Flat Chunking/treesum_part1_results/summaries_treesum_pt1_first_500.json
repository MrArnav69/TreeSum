The New York City woman, who's suing Sean for $127,000, testified in court Friday that when she arrived at her nephew's birthday party in Westport, Conn., on March 28, 2011, Sean was riding his brand-new bike outside.

Connell told the jury she didn't complain about her injury at the time because \"it was his birthday party and I didn't want to upset him,\" but she noted that the broken wrist upended her busy life. \"I live in Manhattan in a third-floor walk-up, so it has been very difficult,\" she said. \"And we all know how crowded it is in Manhattan.\" Not to mention how it affected her in social situations: \"I was at a party recently, and it was difficult to hold my hors d'oeuvre plate,\" she noted.

The court \"appeared headed for a defeat for the company,\" writes Eugene Robinson at the Washington Post, though he notes that the outcome \"remains in doubt.\" It's not clear whether the court rules in favor of broadcasters in the case, it could have \"far-reaching implications,\" writes Denniston. Here's a look at some of the key lines from today's arguments, as rounded up by the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, and Wall Street Journal: Chief Justice John Roberts: \"At the end of the day, the car dealer's providing cars to the public, the valet parking service is not.\" Justice Antonin Scalia: \"You're asking us to say that this technology is unconstitutional.\" Justice Elena Sotomayor: \"If you provide streaming of music where you also have a contemporaneous live performance, then you also get a public performance.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The Supreme Court heard oral arguments yesterday in ABC v. Aereo, a much-watched case that could have big implications for both cloud computing and broadcast television\u2014implications the justices didn't seem comfortable with. Aereo allows users to record broadcast TV online and watch it at their leisure. The major broadcast networks are suing it for copyright violation, and stand to lose billions in fees cable companies pay to carry their programming. Aereo says it's simply renting users the equipment to do online what they can legally do at home. Here's how the arguments went: \"If you're comfortable with the Supreme Court resolving disputes over technology, the transcript of Tuesday's oral arguments \u2026 should change your mind,\" writes Jon Healey at the LA Times. Stephen Breyer at one point made an analogy to \"what used to be called a phonograph record store.\" He also worried that Aereo's antennas could \"pick up every television signal in the world,\" which isn't true, Healey pointed out, \"because the world isn't, you know, flat.\" The justices seemed skeptical of Aereo's business model. \"It's not logical to me that you can make these millions of copies and essentially sell them to the public,\" Sonia Sotomayor said. John Roberts said the company was only using thousands of small antennas, instead of a few big ones \"to get around copyright laws,\" the Wall Street Journal reports. But the justices also seemed genuinely worried that their decision could stifle innovation. Sotomayor asked what effect this would have on \"the Dropbox and the iCloud.\" When the broadcasters' lawyers told them to \"just be confident\" that Aereo's service was different, Samuel Alito said, \"I don't find that very satisfying. \u2026 I need to understand what effect it will have on these other technologies.\" Aereo's best hope is that the justices adhere to a lower court's Cartoon Network vs. Cablevision ruling, which held that customers could make DVR recordings on Cablevision's hard drives, writes Lyle Denniston at SCOTUSblog. At one point, Anthony Kennedy suggested lawyers pretend that decision had come from the high court. Ultimately, the justices didn't seem to like their options. \"This is really hard for me,\" Sotomayor confessed. \"I don't see how to get out of it,\" Breyer agreed."

For example, they point to a Fox News story Monday detailing how the wife of a Justice Department official named Bruce Ohr worked for the company behind the infamous anti-Trump dossier that emerged during the election. Ohr was recently demoted for concealing his own meetings with the company, Fusion GPS. \"The Department of Justice and FBI cannot ignore the multiple problems that have been created by these obvious conflicts of interests,\" Trump attorney Jay Sekulow tells Axios. \"These new revelations require the appointment of a special counsel to investigate.\" It's not clear how likely this is to happen, but Attorney General Jeff Sessions has previously floated the idea of a second special counsel to cover a wide range of GOP concerns. Meanwhile, the Washington Post has a profile of Trump's legal trio: Sekulow (the TV presence), Ty Cobb (a White House attorney), and John Dowd (Trump's personal attorney).

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 As Australia mourns two hostages killed in a Sydney cafe yesterday, many are wondering what gunman Man Haron Monis was doing on the streets in the first place. The Iranian-born cleric, who was killed when police commandos stormed the cafe, was on bail for around 50 counts of sexual and indecent assault and for charges of being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife. The 31-year-old mother of two was stabbed repeatedly and set on fire with the use of lighter fluid last April, allegedly by Monis' girlfriend. The crime happened in an apartment stairwell. More: Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott says the government will look into why the 50-year-old was out on bail and why he did not appear on the country's terrorist watch list, the BBC reports. \"How can someone who has had such a long and checkered history not be on the appropriate watch lists, and how can someone like that be entirely at large in the community?\" he wondered at a press conference today. \"These are questions that we need to look at carefully and calmly and methodically.\" Just three days before he walked into the cafe with a gun and took 17 people hostage, Monis had failed in an attempt to overturn a conviction for sending \"grossly offensive\" letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. The country's High Court rejected his application to hear a fresh constitutional challenge to the charges against him, for which he was sentenced to 300 hours of community service. Monis, who declared himself to be a sheikh and a \"spiritual healer,\" was seen as a \"fringe figure\" in Sydney's Islamic community, according to a Guardian profile. Shia Muslim leaders had asked police to probe his claims to be a leading cleric and last week, he announced on his website that he had converted to Sunni Islam and pledged allegiance to ISIS. The lawyer who represented Monis in the murder case tells the Australian Broadcasting Company that his client, who came to the country as a refugee in 1996, may have thought he had \"nothing to lose,\" hence \"participating in something as desperate and outrageous as this.\" He says that while in prison, Monis suffered some \"very unpleasant events, involving matters of excrement over himself and his cell,\" and he is certain that the siege was the act of a \"one-off random individual,\" not an organized terrorist group."

STRAUSS and ALEXA VALIENTE \n \n Here's the Situation: \n \n Long-time Hubbard, Ohio, residents Rick and Cindy Krlich told ABC News' \"20/20? that everyone in their town has turned against them. \n \n Over the past seven years, they said, horns have been honked 5,000 times by people driving past their house. \n \n \"In the beginning, it was 100 times a day,\" Rick Krlich said. Lately, the couple said, it has settled down to ...",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 An Ohio man is suing the city of Hubbard, the police chief, and the county for allegedly harassing him by driving by his house and honking their horns, Courthouse News reports. Garrick Krlich says the harassment started in 2007 when he bought a property next to his own that was up for auction following the death of the former fire chief's aunt. The property had been in John Clemente Jr.'s family for more than a century. After Krlich bought the property, Clemente \"told plaintiff to rescind his bid or they\u2019d be \u2018bitter enemies for life,\u2019 because the house had be in his family since 1922,\" according to Krlich's lawsuit. He says he called the police and 911, but nothing has been done. Krlich installed video and audio recording equipment to capture \"countless incidents of horn blowing by passing motorists, including, inter alia, the Hubbard Police Department firemen (while driving police cruisers), City of Hubbard councilmen ... and numerous city and county officials, school buses and others connected to the local governments.\" Krlich is suing for compensatory damages for his video recording equipment and legal fees as well as punitive damages. The event, which was held at the town's fire station, was a chance for the neighbors to come together and try to put an end to the honking. \"I think it's very important that we come together as a community,\" said the Clementes' son. \"We're all from the same family, we all live in the same house, and we all know each other.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Friends driving by your house and honking a friendly hello: cool. City and county officials and employees honking for almost 10 years as they drive by to get back at you for placing a bid on a house: not so cool. Per Courthouse News Service, that's the claim of Ohio resident Garrick Krlich's lawsuit filed Thursday against the city of Hubbard, Trumbull County, and Hubbard's police chief, all of whom Krlich says \"intentionally turned a blind eye\" to an orchestrated campaign to \"harass, intimidate, terrorize, and retaliate against him,\" mainly via the car-honking. Why Krlich says he's the object of retaliation: In 2007, he tried to buy at an auction a neighboring property that for nearly a century had been in the family of the town's fire chief at the time. Krlich says when he put in the highest offer, then-Fire Chief John Clemente Jr. told him he'd better take it back or risk being \"bitter enemies.\" Krlich kept his bid in, though for unspecified reasons, the property \"did not pass to him as it should have\"\u2014and, he says, the harassment started anyway. Described on the Krlich.com website (subtitled \"Small Town Terrorism\") as \"undeserved, uninterrupted, unyielding spite,\" the subsequent actions Krlich says have been directed toward him\u2014the relentless honking, an unsympathetic police department, a 911 service that hangs up on him\u2014have been carried out by various Hubbard firefighters driving city trucks, members of Police Chief James Taafe's family, city councilmen, and others, per the suit. In a 2014 20/20 interview, Krlich says the honking peaked at 100 times a day (it's since died down to just a couple per day); Clemente and his wife noted in the same interview that Krlich was simply litigious. \"If you beep your horn one time, he'll take you to court,\" Marlene Clemente said."

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 There are two kinds of people when it comes to air travel: Those who think flying has never been better and those who think it's never been worse. The former group includes the 930 million passengers who flew out of a US airport last year. Seats keep getting smaller and closer together; seat cushions are getting thinner. Everything costs extra: bags, food, and even things we took to be basics, like seat assignments and carry-ons. \"None of us fly by choice,\" one disgruntled United passenger recently wrote in a pretty representative tweet. \"Flying sucks, period.\" But there's another group of people who see it differently: industry experts. They say flying is the cheapest and safest it has ever been, affordable for the majority of Americans, and safest of all. In fact, on-time arrivals are hovering around 80%, the best they've ever been. So this is a conundrum. How can flying be both the best and the worst it\u2019s ever been? Business Insider asked more than 80 airline workers\u2014including flight attendants, gate agents, ticket agents, and other airport customer service reps\u2014to weigh in. Here are some of the things they couldn't say: \"I'm not talking to hear myself speak. It's not my job to say that.\" \"You could give me an in-flight entertainment system loaded with the entire library of human artistic achievement and I would still somehow be bored because I am on an airplane, waiting. Then I think about the fact I'm waiting. And now I\u2019m noticing my butt's sore. And the guy in front of me.\" \"I love my job is my job: I's worse. I could be a problem. \"I could be an issue, because the most.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Though the number of complaints on Twitter might lead you to believe otherwise, \"Flying has never been better.\" At least according to the industry experts the Outline spoke with, who pointed out that taking to the friendly skies has gotten safer and more on time (arrivals are now punctual about 80% of the time). And while it may not feel like it, it's cheaper, too, at least compared to the early '70s, when price fixing meant a flight from New York to LA was not allowed to cost less than about $1,600 in today's dollars. The Outline's full story works to bust some misconceptions, and Business Insider does something similar. It talks to 80 airline workers\u2014the ones who staff the gates, the planes, the customer service lines\u2014to share the secrets they wish they could share. Here are 5 standouts: Know I'm not being rude when I don't give you a free upgrade: One customer service agent explains \"the airline computer system tracks everything, and big brother can be watching us\"\u2014and doling out a free upgrade improperly can be a fireable offense. Don't take off your shoes: It might be tempting to wiggle those toes under the seat, but this isn't your house, and that \"water\" you're stepping on in the bathroom isn't actually water. Don't let those hands wander: If you're tempted to tug at your flight attendant's clothes to get his or her attention as they walk by, just don't. Ever. Keep the number 50 in mind: That's how many passengers are generally served by a single flight attendant. We're not forgetting about you, explains one. We're just dealing with minimal staffing. Know I have to do what the FAA says: That includes saying specific things. Not following the FAA's rules and regulations could cause a flight attendant to be fined.

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 The Center for Investigative Reporting has a disturbing story out of Southern California, where a company called Spinal Solutions sold millions of dollars' worth of spinal implants to doctors who then turned to the company for advice and cash. The problem? The implants were fakes. The company mixed authentic and counterfeit screws in surgical kits that were sent to doctors across the nation. The FDA was alerted about alleged counterfeit operations in 2011, but the company didn't close until 2013\u2014and then because of crippling debt. \u201cWhat do they do if they find out there are these bogus parts that can come unscrewed?\u201d says Susan Reynolds, a California woman who opted for spinal fusion surgery\u2014a procedure that offered little relief from her chronic pain. Five years later, she had most of her spinal hardware removed, convinced that the erector set of metal in her spine was the source of ongoing problems. A nurse slipped them under her pillow. Moses, 38, had all but forgotten the bag of hardware until she received a letter from an Oakland, Calif., law firm in March. The report focuses on Roger Williams, the pitchman for Spinal Solutions, a company that makes spinal implants. More than two dozen plaintiffs have signed on to a massive lawsuit concerning an alleged scheme in which patients received non-FDA approved screws during spine and back surgery. \"The fraudulent non- FDA conforming devices were installed in people's bodies at a very low cost to the providers,\" an attorney said Friday. \"They were then fraudulently billing the insurance companies, the worker's, and how much money the money.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Medical firm founder Roger Williams owned private planes, flashy cars, and a yacht dubbed \"Spare Change\"; he had courtside seats to see the Lakers and enjoyed spending thousands at strip clubs. But an investigation by the Center for Investigative Reporting suggests his $18-million-a-year California company, Spinal Solutions, made its money in part through counterfeiting expensive screws used in spinal surgeries and then distributing the knockoff screws to surgeons. Williams allegedly wooed doctors via lavish vacations, Lakers seats, and containers full of cash. There's no evidence doctors were complicit in the reported counterfeiting, but plenty of them used the screws. A machinist, now 85, tells CIR that he made copies of screws for the company for $65 each, which is about half of their typical price\u2014and far, far less than the $12,500 hospitals once billed for them. Other companies' logos were also falsified on the screws. A whistleblower finally told the FDA about the alleged counterfeiting in 2011, but the company was allowed to continue operation until debts ruined it in 2013. The losers in all this, of course, were the patients, who could face dangers thanks to the substandard equipment. \"This has been terrible, worst thing that\u2019s ever happened to me \u2026 not knowing if the stuff still in me they couldn\u2019t get out will one day kill me,\" says one patient. As of last month, 32 lawsuits sought to address the matter, CBS 2 reports; one has more than 20 plaintiffs. (In happier spinal news, a paralyzed man's nose helped him to walk again.)"

Researchers at Johns Hopkins University say they found vulnerabilities in the devices that allow hackers to remotely control them and access patients' data, reports Ars Technica.

The researchers say that despite warnings from security researchers for years, manufacturers haven't taken the necessary steps to secure their products. \"It's still ideal to make cardiac devices more secure as cyberattacks become more common, elaborate, and sophisticated,\" writes Sam Barsanti at Gizmodo. \"Unfortunately, it sounds like very few listened.\" A separate study by security firm Ponemon Institute found that only 17% of manufacturers did so. St. Jude Medical, which makes implantable pacemakers, is recalling 465,000 devices due to \"potential exploitation of cybersecurity vulnerabilities,\" the Wall Street Journal reports.

It's unclear how many people in other countries are affected. Over the past decade, there's been an increase in reports of serious vulnerabilities in pacemakers, insulin pumps, and other medical devices, reports Ars Technica. That's because they're now outfitted with tiny radio-frequency equipment for remote maintenance that no longer requires new and costly surgeries when the devices need updating. Back in May, Engadget reported that security company WhiteScope found 8,000 bugs hackers could exploit in pacemaker programs alone. While attackers must be within 50 feet of the device to hack into it, and no one has yet to die from a cyber attack, some argue that the mere threat of an attack is reason enough to make these devices as sophisticated and protected as possible.

The spokeswoman also argued that Pledger's \"quality of life was significantly improved during the time he was taking Risperdal,\" per the Daily News.

Harrell was arrested ...",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Debra Lynn Harrell dropped her 9-year-old daughter off at a North Augusta, SC, park around 2pm Monday and then left for work, WFXG reports. Police say the girl told them her mother drops her off at the park all the time so she can play while her mother is at work. The girl also told police she sometimes walks over to McDonald's to get lunch, according to the report. Harrell confessed to leaving her daughter alone in the park and was arrested and booked into jail. The Department of Social Services took custody of the girl. Harrell has pleaded not guilty, and her lawyer says she is \"a good mother and a good citizen.\" But at Slate, Amanda Marcotte writes that it's rare for a parent to be charged with a crime for leaving a child alone. \"Every state has its own child maltreatment laws and definitions of neglect\u2014and they are all very vague with no specifics,\" she writes. \"Most include within neglect failure to provide adequate supervision.\" Harrell is black, and class is definitely behind how her situation came to be in the first place. \"This allows race, class, and gender biases to influence decisions in both the child welfare and criminal justice systems,\" writes Tracy Clark-Flory on Salon.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Should sending your kid to play alone at a local park land you in jail? Because that's what happened to Debra Harrell. The 46-year-old South Carolina mom repeatedly sent her 9-year-old daughter to a well-trafficked park while she went to work at McDonald's. When the parents of other children at the park found out, they called police, who arrested Harrell and charged her with unlawful conduct toward a child. The daughter has been placed in state custody. Local news outlets first reported the story on July 1, but it's been getting wider attention lately thanks to an indignant post on Reason from \"Free Range Kids\" advocate Lenore Skenazy. And so far, pretty much everyone agrees that the arrest is senseless and wrong. Some reactions: Skenazy notes that the original news reports make it sound like Harrell \"committed a serious, unconscionable crime,\" as locals speculate that the girl could have been kidnapped. \"To which I must ask: In broad daylight? In a crowded park? Just because something happened on Law & Order doesn't mean it's happening all the time in real life.\" \"Since I'm a parent, Harrell\u2019s arrest scares me: How can I appropriately parent my child when doing something that seems relatively safe, if out of fashion, can get you arrested?\" asks Jessica Grose at Slate. One law professor tells Grose that the statutes for child welfare laws are often broadly written, giving police lots of latitude\u2014and allowing \"race, class, and gender biases to influence decisions.\" That could be the case here, because Harrell is black, and her poverty helped cause the situation. \"The story is a convergence of helicopter parenting with America\u2019s primitive family policy,\" writes Jonathan Chait at New York. \"Our welfare policy is designed to make everybody, even single mothers, work full-time jobs. The social safety net makes it difficult for low-wage single mothers to obtain adequate child care. And society is seized by bizarre fears that children are routinely snatched up by strangers in public places,\" which is actually an exceedingly rare phenomenon. \"The state has caused the child far more trauma than she was ever likely to suffer in the park,\" writes Conor Friedersdorf at the Atlantic, and they're taking the child at a time when the state has a shortage of foster families. And there's no empirical evidence saying the child would be safer, say, sitting at McDonald's. \"The actual safety of a given kid is not being rigorously determined. State employees are drawing on their prejudices to make somewhat arbitrary judgment calls.\""

They returned the charts to the Afghan Geological Survey's library after the US invasion in 2001, but the information was ignored until 2009, when a Pentagon task force that had created business development programs in Iraq was transferred to Afghanistan. Afghanistan's Ministry of Mines \"is not ready to handle this,\" says a Pentagon official. \"We are trying to help them get ready.\" Already, the biggest mineral deposits have been found in southern and eastern Afghanistan, including large gold deposits in Pashtun areas along the border with Pakistan. Afghanistan could also be a major producer of ni lithium, a soft metal used in producing superconducting steel. James Risen of the New York Times is taking a lot of flak for a front-page story yesterday that claimed the US had found $1 trillion in mineral reserves in Afghanistan. Critics accused Risen of deliberately timed the story to coincide with Gen.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 As has been widely noted, Mitch McConnell had a truly awful Tuesday. The Senate majority leader had to surrender on ObamaCare repeal, ally Bob Corker announced he was retiring, and, perhaps worst of all, the Senate candidate that McConnell strongly backed in Alabama got trounced by one backed by the Steve Bannon contingent. Just how bad is it for McConnell? Here's a look at coverage: Mocked by Trump: The president has taken to doing physical impressions of a slump-shouldered McConnell, reports Axios. Trump also reportedly called out McConnell as \"weak\" at a dinner with conservative activists, reports Politico. On the wane: McConnell has gone from \"brilliant tactician\" to looking vulnerable after the defeats this week, reports the New York Times. If the GOP fails to get tax reform passed this year, his post as majority leader could be in jeopardy\u2014especially with populist insurgents backed by Bannon looking to win more seats. No immediate danger: Both Politico and the Times say McConnell retains rock-solid support in the Republican Conference and thus is not in any immediate peril. Much of that support is based on his formidable fundraising skills on behalf of Senate Republicans. Beware the midterms: In a piece subtitled, \"Is the Senate Leader Losing His Grip on the GOP?,\" Abigail Tracy at Vanity Fair notes that midterm elections in general are often unkind to the party in power: \"With the GOP in the midst of an ideological schism, McConnell\u2019s faction could be headed for a reckoning.\" Indeed, Tuesday's triple whammy \"just shows how weak the Republican establishment is right now,\" writes Harry Enten at FiveThirtyEight. Boehner's fate? McConnell is willing to take all the criticism coming from conservatives over the ObamaCare fail, especially if it protects rank-and-file Republicans, per an analysis at the Washington Post. \"But one thing that could hamper McConnell\u2019s long-term standing would be if he became a real albatross to his own incumbents in primary elections ahead,\" writes Paul Kane. Fear of that played a role in John Boehner's resignation as House speaker two years ago. False narrative: Many in the media are portraying the Alabama results as a loss for Trump, but winner Roy Moore is decidedly Trumpian, writes Erick Erickson at the Resurgent.

Ricken of Green Bay declared \"with moral certainty\" that Ms. Brise did indeed have encounters \"of a supernatural character\" that are \"worthy of belief.\" Brise went on to teach children in the faith, and Mary continued to instruct her until her death in 1858. Now, \"our Holy Mother, the Blessed Virgin Mary, visited the young woman,\" the Green Bay diocese says on its website. \"It was an unlikely visitation to a simple, humble country girl on a Dirt Road in the wooded countryside. Her instruction was seemingly simple but required the commitment of Adele's life's work: teach the children inthe faith.\" Click here for more.",

This year's winners were announced at a ceremony at Harvard last night, the Christian Science Monitor reports. A team led by Harvard-Radcliffe Society of Physics Students created a computer model of the human heart that predicts the heart's rate based on how long a person has been sitting in a chair. The model predicted the heart rate. German doctor Stefan Hessel discovered that the body's immune system responds to stress by attacking its own tissues with enzymes. Hessel's discovery led to the development of a new class of scar tissue called anisotopic dermatitis, which \"attacks the immune system's tolerance for pain.\" Volkswagen won \"for solving the problem of excessive automobile pollution by automatically, electromechanically producing fewer emissions whenever the cars are being tested.\" The economics prize went to a team from New Zealand and the UK who analyzed the \"set of human characteristics associated with the brand,\" or brand personality, by putting pictures of rocks in front of 225 Kiwi students. The psychology award went to Evelyne Debey and Maarten De Schryver for asking a thousand liars how.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Thursday night was the silliest night in scientists' calendars, and with winners including a man who wore prosthetic extensions to live among a herd of goats in the Alps for several days, this year's Ig Nobel awards did not disappoint. In front of a rowdy crowd, real Nobel winners handed out the awards to those who had the year's oddest research. Winners also received $10 trillion\u2014in a single Zimbabwean banknote (US value: less than $1). Some highlights from the annual ceremony at Harvard University, which was presented by the Annals of Improbable Research: \"Goat man\" Tom Thwaites wore his goat legs to the awards ceremony .He tells the BBC that he gained a \"goat buddy\" during his time in the Alps\u2014but there were some tense moments. \"I was just sort of walking around, you know, chewing grass, and just looked up and then suddenly realized that everyone else had stopped chewing and there was this tension which I hadn't kind of noticed before and then one or two of the goats started tossing their horns around and I think I was about to get in a fight,\" he says. Thwaites shared the biology prize with Charles Foster, another Brit who has spent time living in the wild as, among other things, a badger, an otter, and a fox. Science reports that the medicine prize went to a team of neurologists and psychologists, who, with the help of video cameras, mirrors, and volunteers injected with a chemical that causes a mild itch, discovered that scratching the left side of your body will relieve an itch on the right side if you're looking in a mirror at the time. A Japanese team won the perception prize with a study published as \"Perceived Size and Perceived Distance of Targets Viewed From Between the Legs: Evidence for Proprioceptive Theory.\" Their research involved bending over and looking at things from between their legs to see if they looked any different. Egyptian urologist Ahmed Shafik was posthumously awarded the reproduction prize for his research on how wearing trousers of polyester, cotton, or wool affected the sex lives of rats. The rats that wore polyester had the biggest drop in sexual activity, notes the Guardian. This year's Ig Nobel in chemistry went to Volkswagen, for \"solving the problem of excessive automobile pollution emissions by automatically, electromechanically producing fewer emissions whenever the cars are being tested.\" (Previous Ig Nobels have gone to scientists who swallowed parboiled dead shrews and a researcher who allowed bees to sting every part of his anatomy.)"

The lawsuit was brought by the Animal Legal Defense Fund on behalf of three Asian elephants who were moved from the LA Zoo to a breeding facility in the city last year. The zoo argued that the move was necessary to ensure the animals' health and well-being. The Supreme Court ruled in the zoo's favor on Monday, saying the city failed to prove the elephants' health was in danger and that the zoo was within its rights to move them. The ruling was a victory for the zoo, which says it \"provides the highest level of care for our elephants and all our animals.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 For years, the Los Angeles Zoo has been under a court order requiring it to exercise its three elephants on soft ground and not use electric shocks or barbed sticks on them. On Thursday, that court order was overturned in a unanimous decision by the California Supreme Court that animal activists are decrying. A Los Angeles County Superior Court judge issued the injunction against the zoo in 2012 in response to a taxpayer lawsuit alleging animal cruelty. But in what the Los Angeles Times calls a \"highly technical ruling\" overturning the injunction, the state's highest court said a taxpayer lawsuit (which uses civil law rules) can't be used to address criminal conduct. The taxpayer lawsuit began in 2007 when an LA resident sued over what he said was abusive treatment of the elephants, also including the use of chains and drugs, Courthouse News Service reports. A lawyer who worked on the case, for free, for more than five years says he'll attempt to find another way to get a similar injunction against the zoo, or request that the state legislature overturn the ruling. \"I thought we had done something here to move the ball forward and instead the Supreme Court has allowed the zoo to take a step into the Dark Ages,\" he says. The Supreme Court explained in its ruling that by obtaining the injunction in such a way, the court did not allow the zoo to have a jury trial or the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The barbed sticks known as bull hooks have since been banned entirely in California, and for its part, the zoo says that it has never used and will never use them or electric shocks as disciplinary tools for its elephants, and that it will continue to follow the court order despite it being overturned."

The updated Red List, released Thursday at a biological diversity conference in Cancun, Mexico, points to man as the main driver of the declining stats, with poaching, habitat loss, and local unrest all assuming partial blame. A Duke University conservation biologist says the IUCN is partly to blame, too, for not considering more species threatened. \"There's a strong tendency to think that familiar species [such as giraffes, chimps, etc.] must be OK because ... we see them in zoos,\" he tells the AP. \"This is dangerous.\" Some good news, at least for some long-neckers: Of the nine giraffe subspecies, three of them are experiencing increasing populations; one is stable.

Now, South Korean and American officials tell the New York Times that Jang was actually fighting rivals for control of North Korea's lucrative exports: coal, clams, and crabs. North Korean military forces were deployed to retake control of one of the sources of those exports, the rich crab and clam fishing grounds that Jang seized from the military. In the fight, the emaciated, poorly trained North Korean forces \"were beaten\u2014very badly\u2014by Uncle Jang\u2019s loyalists,\" according to one official. The rout of his forces appears to have been the final straw for Kim, who saw his 67-year-old uncle as a threat to his authority over the military and, just as important, to his own family\u2019s dwindling sources of revenue. Eventually, at Kim's order, the North Korean army came back with a larger force and prevailed. The battle was over who would profit from North Korea\u2019s most lucrative exports. The two men died in front of a firing squad. But instead of rifles, the squad used antiaircraft machine guns, a form of execution that according to South Korean intelligence officials and news media. South Korean officials say Jang and his allies had been waging a campaign of \"abuse of power\" through their business deals with China, which badly needed North Korean coal.

In other news from Pyongyang: The Telegraph lists some of the 24 charges against Jang, which apparently included \"gnawing at the unity and cohesion of the party\" and \"dreaming different dreams.\" He was also blamed for \"improper relations with several women\" and \"squandering foreign currency at casinos.\" But Pyongyang's claims that Jang was executed over his plans to seize power are likely inaccurate, says South Korea's head of intelligence: The real problem was Jang and his associates' push to take control of major business deals\u2014for instance, coal sales to China, the official said in a closed meeting, as noted by the New York Times. After Jang's rivals complained, Kim ordered Jang's associates to drop certain deals, but they refused; Kim believed his authority was being questioned.

Plaintiffs in the long-running lawsuit included the makers of a documentary about the song and singer Rupa Marya, who had to pay $455 for including it on a live album. \"I hope we can start reimagining copyright law to do what it's supposed to do\u2014protect the creations of people who make stuff so that we can continue to make more stuff,\" she tells the AP. Lawyers say they now plan to make the suit a class-action one to force Warner to pay back some of the royalties, the Times reports."

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Wonder what happened to iconic film directors like David Lynch, John Waters, and Francis Ford Coppola? Well, Hollywood checked the balance sheet and decided to stop making their kind of mid-budget films, Flavorwire reports. It's all dollars and cents: Thoughtful or offbeat films costing $5 million to $60 million can make moderate profits at best, while blockbusters with international appeal are able to bring in sick money. Paramount's Titanic made that point in 1997 by costing $200 million and earning nearly $2.2 billion worldwide. At that time, mid-budget films like Kiss the Girls and In & Out dominated the Paramount slate and drew modest profits; this year, mega-flicks like Transformers: Age of Extinction, Hercules, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles rule Paramount's roost and earn the big bucks. \"You could make movies in the ten-to-twenty-million-dollar budget range\" at one time, says Susan Seidelman, director of Desperately Seeking Susan. Now, she says, studios \"have to appeal to every demographic in every part of the world.\" And few seasoned directors want to test the indie market, where tons of under-$2 million films are vying for attention. So Spike Lee has funded a film via Kickstarter, Steven Soderbergh publicly quit feature filmmaking last year, and other directors are turning to TV for creative freedom. This sea-change has been coming for years now, as an old Forbes piece shows, but some\u2014including Steven Spielberg\u2014believe Hollywood will over-invest in blockbusters: \"There\u2019s going to be an implosion\" where several \"mega-budgeted movies are going to go crashing into the ground, and that\u2019s going to change the paradigm again,\" he says."

She says at least 20 of the 78 sentences involved strongly resemble SparkNotes passages and compares several of them side by side. Multiple phrases, including \"Ahab's lust for vengeance,\" appear both in SparkNotes and Dylan's talk, but not in Moby Dick itself. He had to give the talk to collect $922,000 in prize money. \"Some men who receive injuries are led to God, others are led to bitterness,\" a quote that one blogger thought Dylan had invented, appears to be based on SparkNotes. Pitzer suggests that Dylan donate some of the prize money to the SparkNotes writer, though others are more forgiving. University of Minnesota music professor Alex Lubet tells the Star-Tribune that Dylan's lecture shouldn't be treated like a classroom assignment. \"His lecture is wild and strange,\" Lubet says. \"It\u2019s meant to be a post-modern work of art.

Weeks after returning home, the 36-year-old noticed an itchy spot on the left side of her groin and assumed she'd been bitten by an insect, reports Live Science. Thinking it was an infected spider bite, her doctor fruitlessly prescribed antibiotics. Dr. Enrico Camporesi of Tampa's Memorial Hospital next took a look, noticing a hole in the center of the wound, which felt hard, as though something were inside. A surgeon suspected it was a living thing, and turned out to be right. Cutting open the lesion, doctors found a tapered human botfly larva with rows of spines and hooks meant to keep it buried in the woman's skin for up to 128 days, reports the Miami Herald. Commonly found in Central America, a human botfly first deposits her eggs on an insect, like a mosquito, which carries them to human or animal hosts. Injected in skin via bites, the egg hatches into larva that eventually drops from the skin and continues developing, eventually reaching the size of a large bumblebee, per the Journal of Investigative Medicine High Impact Case Reports. Though the botfly didn't reach the pupa stage in this case, it wasn't necessary for its human host to go under the knife. Belizeans cover lesions\u2014with petroleum jelly, nail polish, and even bacon strips, per the Herald\u2014to suffocate larvae, which emerge for air and can be removed with tweezers.

Here are the most interesting tidbits from both: Obama and Harry Reid decided on their no-negotiation strategy over the summer, believing that Boehner could never unite his fractured caucus behind anything. Republicans never believed the pair would stick to it. Boehner and Reid initially struck a deal in which Boehner would pass a sequester-level budget with an ObamaCare-defunding rider that the Senate could simply strip out. Boehner assumed\u2014incorrectly\u2014that his caucus only wanted a show vote. Boehner's former chief of staff was feeding the White House intelligence, telling it that Boehner would have to fight up until the debt ceiling deadline. Reid also took to monitoring Twitter for hints on the GOP's next move\u2014a sign of how badly communication was flowing. Many Republicans turned to Joe Biden, hoping he would intervene. Biden told them he'd been \"sidelined \u2026 at the direction of the president,\" one rep says. Reid, bitter about the fiscal cliff deal Biden negotiated, had wanted him out. At one point, Boehner brought up the idea of a \"grand bargain\" at a White House meeting; Reid laughed in his face. When Paul Ryan joined the fray at an Oct. 10 meeting, he told Obama that he would \"miss his moment\" and derail his whole term if he didn't strike a deal. But he also made what White House aides called a \"Freudian slip,\" saying, \"We\u2019re going to have six weeks to negotiate the debt limit.\" That night, aides to Boehner, Cantor, and Obama began talking about a broader budget deal, and agreed to talk more in the morning. The White House never called. When Mitch McConnell finally decided he had to broker the deal, he partnered with Lamar Alexander\u2014angering Susan Collins, who had worked far harder on the process, only to see her own deal torpedoed. McConnell picked Alexander because he had better conservative credentials, and was pals with Reid confidante Chuck Schumer. Alexander and Schumer brokered the deal behind the scenes, then passed it off to Reid and McConnell. McConnell tells the Washington Post that he saw himself as a backup quarterback thrown into the game. \"I felt like I was on the two-yard line, I had a pretty weak offensive line, and the best I could hope for was to try to punt.\" Boehner made one last-ditch attempt to pass an alternative. \"We're running out of time,\" he told his caucus. \"Your 'no' vote has consequences.\" But as Reid and Obama had predicted, he couldn't convince them. With the ball back in McConnell and Reid's court, McConnell made a few last-minute demands. Reid rejected them. It took all of 15 minutes for McConnell to call back and accept Reid's terms."

However, with no documented proof, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Friday it must propose the fine. Dr. Cornelis Van der Schyf, vice president for research at the university, blamed partially completed paperwork from 15 years ago as the school tried to dispose of the plutonium. \"Unfortunately, because there was a lack of sufficient historical records to demonstrate the disposal pathway employed in 2003, the source in question had to be listed as missing,\" he said in a statement to the AP. The statement said the plutonium \"poses no direct health issue or risk to public safety.\" The plutonium was being used to develop ways to ensure nuclear waste containers weren't leaking and to find ways to detect radioactive material being illegally brought into the US following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. While the missing amount could not be used to make a nuclear bomb, it could be used to create a so-called dirty bomb to spread nuclear contamination. The university, which has 30 days to dispute the proposed fine, reported the plutonium missing on Oct. 13, according to documents released by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Joseph James Pappas, 62, should be considered armed, dangerous, and possibly suicidal, Houston police Chief Art Acevedo said at a news conference Wednesday afternoon. \"There was a lot of planning that went into this,\" Acevedo said of the July 20 attack on Dr. Mark Hausknecht, adding that it appears a \"20-year-old grudge\" led to the attack, per CNN. Hausknecht was gunned down while riding his bike to work at Houston Methodist Hospital, which is part of the busy Texas Medical Center. Authorities say the shooter rode past Hausknecht before turning around and firing. A tip on Tuesday led police to suspect Pappas, the chief said, though he didn't elaborate as to the nature of the tip. Acevedo said Pappas hadn't been seen in 36 to 48 hours, the AP reports. He said the last anyone had heard from Pappas was in a Tuesday morning text message in which Pappas wrote that he was going to kill himself. Acevedo said police searched his home at 4am Wednesday and found evidence that ties Pappas to the killing, but he declined to elaborate as to the nature of the evidence. The chief said Pappas, who was a peace officer in Harris County for three decades per the Houston Chronicle, is white and very fit, and that he's likely getting around on his 10-speed bicycle, which he rides \"extensively and almost exclusively.\" Friends and family have described Hausknecht as a humble and generous man who was adored by his patients, volunteered in his community and cared about the environment. He was also an avid cyclist and rode his bike to work each morning, as he lived less than 2 miles from his office."

Constand first went to the police in 2005, but the district attorney's office in Norristown, Pa., said in a statement today that the case will be reopened because of new allegations and because the statute of limitations has run out. The trial is expected to last four to six weeks, and prosecutors are expected to call as many as 50 other accusers to the stand to make the case that Cosby used drugs to give Constand what she says was three pills and a glass of wine so he could sexually assault her, per the Atlantic. The big question is whether Cosby will testify in his own defense. (He has said he doesn't plan to.)",

Reports of Malcolm-Jamal Warner, who played son Theo Huxtable, attending are similarly being bandied about. The New York Times offers an overview of what to expect during the trial\u2014\"perhaps America's highest profile celebrity trial since that of OJ Simpson\"\u2014including expected lines of evidence, the Cosby legal team's anticipated strategy, and some juror information. CNN says the trial has come down to a \"he said-she said\" scenario, with one other alleged victim expected to testify against Cosby in addition to Constand. \"What Cosby is hoping for is that the jury forgets about the other 48 [alleged victims],\" a Fordham criminal law professor notes. Meanwhile, Constand herself is reportedly ready to face intense grilling on the witness stand. \"There's no trepidation, no fear,\" a close friend who's also one of Cosby's alleged victims tells NBC. \"She used to play basketball and she prepared for those games like nobody else and that is what she has done here.\" (Vice calls the trial a \"test for America.\")"

The suit alleges the slot machines were designed to lure Stevens into a \" trance-like state\" where he could lose all his money, and that the manufacturers of the machines were aware of the addictive nature of the devices and tried to make them asaddictive as possible. \"The manufacturers know these machines are addictive and do their best to made them addictive so they can make more money,\" says the lead attorney on the suit, which names Caesars Riverboat Casino in Elizabeth, Ind., and several other casinos.

Scott Stevens was a successful Ohio finance exec whose life started unraveling in 2006 after a trade show in Vegas. For six years, his gambling habit spiraled out of control: He sneaked off to gamble when his wife thought he was working, embezzled nearly $4 million from his firm, and drained his family's savings\u2014until the day in 2012 he decided to end his life. After his suicide, Stacy started researching gambling addiction (she hadn't even known about her husband's problem) and filed suit against the West Virginia casino where he was a regular, as well as the maker of the slot machines there. Experts relay how casinos track and target addicted gamblers, supply ready flows of cash via on-site ATMs, and offer plenty of perks to keep them coming back.

While the casinos and machine manufacturers place the blame for gambling addictions on individuals, Terry Noffsinger, the lead attorney for the Stevens suit, says these addictive machines are not due to \"negligence.

He called on America's \"relentless stamina and vigilance and every institutional check and balance this country can muster\" to restrain Trump, per Variety, noting, \"If we do not allow Donald Trump to exhaust our fight and somehow come out of this presidency calamity-less and constitutionally, partially intact, then I, Donald J.

Among their warnings: The Wall Street Journal reports that the decision could have a huge impact on sites like Netflix and YouTube, whose video services hog a lot of bandwidth (they account for 32% and 19% of peak web traffic, respectively). If ISPs start making Netflix, for instance, pay a usage fee to maintain speedy content delivery, that cost could make a serious dent in its profits\u2014or trickle down to consumers. ISPs could charge sites big fees in exchange for faster content delivery, potentially giving giants who can pay, like Amazon, a big leg up over independent retailers\u2014not to mention other small businesses, the Huffington Post notes.

Daniel Ramirez of Bellingham was one of eight children being treated at Seattle Children's Hospital for acute flaccid myelitis, or AFM, a rare condition in which the nervous system is paralyzed. KOMO News reports Daniel was sent to the hospital with cold symptoms and dizziness and was paralyzed within a few hours. He never recovered. \"We thought that Hayden's case was the most severe it could get\u2014paralyzed from the neck down,\" says his mother, Heather Werdal. \"That is scary for us because we didn't think it could (cause death).\" Hayden, 15, is one of two children in Washington diagnosed with AFM in 2014. It all started with a cold. Ten days later, symptoms went from serious to severe. \"Within 10 days he was completely paralyzed, on a ventilator, and on a trake. He kept getting sicker. It was a scary time,\" says mom. There were just two cases in Washington in 2014, but there have been more than 50 cases in 24 states so far this year. AFM affects the spinal cord. Symptoms typically include sudden weakness in one or more arms or legs, along with loss of muscle. \"This is not something that happens very often,\" says Dr. Richard Leman of the Oregon Public Health Division. \"But we want to detect it if it's there.\" AFM has been linked to enteroviruses and West Nile.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It was a quiet 2015 after dozens of people, mostly children, fell gravely ill in 2014 from a mysterious condition called acute flaccid myelitis, which first presents as a cold but quickly escalates to polio-like symptoms, including paralysis. It is quiet no longer as the Centers for Disease Control confirms what appear to be about 90 cases across 33 states so far this year, and three of them are in Oregon, home to the first case in 2014, reports the Oregonian. Washington, which saw only a couple cases in 2014, appears to be suffering from something of an outbreak, with nine cases so far this year including the first suspected fatality; a 6-year-old boy is believed to have died from the illness, reports MyNorthwest.com. The illness is not contagious, according to doctors, but it's not clear how people contract it. Little is known about AFM, though it's been linked to enteroviruses as well as West Nile and related viruses, and there is no treatment other than comfort care. It affects the nervous system, particularly the spinal cord, and telltale symptoms include weakness and paralysis. \"If a child or adult is experiencing any kind of weakness at all, they should see their health care provider immediately,\" Oregon's public health division spokesperson tells KATU. Aside from Daniel Ramirez, the 6-year-old taken off life support last week, most kids appear to make partial to even full recoveries. KOMO News reports that a teenager afflicted in Washington in 2014 still needs a wheelchair but continues to improve and hopes to go to college soon. (Ramirez went from healthy to dead in two weeks.)"

A roundup of coverage: Politico takes a close look at the implications of Trump involving himself so closely in the federal procurement process and turning it into a \"$440 billion weapon.\" Presidents including Obama have used the process to advance their agendas, but experts say it's unprecedented for one to target individual companies and contracts the way Trump is doing\u2014and his approach is likely to create great uncertainty for defense companies. Business Insider looks at the F-35's capabilities\u2014and the $379 billion contract for Lockheed to supply 2,443 of them to the military. Pentagon officials involved with the F-35 says the fifth-generation jet is far ahead of the Boeing plane, meaning it would take years of redesigning and testing for the Super Hornet to have the same capabilities. The AP reports that Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher said: \"We have committed to working with the president-elect and his administration to provide the best capability, deliverability, and affordability,\" while Lockheed declined to comment. Bloomberg reports that Trump's action \"sidelined decades of policy and practice in how the government spends billions of dollars annually on military hardware.\" A Teal Group military aircraft analyst tells Bloomberg that Trump's tweet was \"bizarre,\" especially since only the Navy uses the Super Hornet, while the Marines are \"completely dependent\" on F-35Bs and the Air Force is sticking with the F-35A. \"Thus, Trump's tweet is both late to the game and completely irrelevant.\" Retired Rear Adm. Dave Oliver tells Politico that Trump's attempt to bring the tactics of the New York real estate market to military procurement will probably just drive prices up. \"He will scare the bejesus out of some fifth-level auditor who is going to say, 'Goodness gracious, maybe I ought to look at whoever he is attacking at the moment,' says Oliver, who was a top Pentagon acquisition official in the 1990s. \"Whether the president has any legal standing of any kind in this doesn't matter.

Medicaid patients would be unable to get treatment at Planned Parenthood, which would be defunded for a year. The bill also includes a tax break for the wealthy. Here's what else you need to know: First, Politico has the full text of the 142-page document Republicans are calling a \"discussion draft.\" Three Republican senators can defeat the bill by joining Democrats to vote against it. FiveThirtyEight reports the most likely candidates are Rand Paul and Mike Lee (who don't believe it goes far enough; Paul recently said he doesn't want \"ObamaCare lite\") and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski (who want more protections for Medicaid and pre-existing conditions). ABC News reports four Republican senators have already said they won't vote for the bill without more information and negotiation: Paul, Lee, Ron Johnson, and Ted Cruz. They released a joint statement saying the bill doesn't do enough to repeal ObamaCare. The bill's writing was cloaked in such secrecy that the Week reports as of Thursday morning quite a few Republican senators still had not seen it; Murkowski, for example, told a reporter, \"I am not a reporter, and I am not a lobbyist, so I've seen nothing.\" President Trump had called the House bill \"mean\" and in need of \"more heart.\" So Scientific American takes a look to see if the Senate version fulfills that requirement.

The bag was collected in a criminal investigation against Max Ary, founder and former director of the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center. He was convicted of stealing and selling hundreds of space artifacts, many on loan from NASA to the Cosmosphere. In 2005, Ary was sentenced to three years in prison and ordered to pay $132,274 in restitution. He has since been released after serving about 70% of his sentence. Federal prosecutors are seeking to recover the bag, which was used on the Apollo 11 lunar landing. It was sold by Nancy Carlson, an Illinois resident, for $995 and later shipped to NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center for authentication. NASA, who had apparently not been notified of the bag\u2019s sale, withheld the bag's return. Carlson sued the agency in June and has asked the federal judge who handled Ary's case to rescind the sale and refund Carlson.

The Apollo 11 bag was among hundreds of items found during a search of his garage. Then the government accidentally sold the bag at auction in 2015. Nancy Carlson, the Illinois woman who bought it for $995, sent it to NASA to confirm it was the real deal.

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 The Supreme Court kicked off its new term today, and there's no shortage of high-profile cases on its docket, including one on abortion. Here's a look at some of the bigger ones: The court will hear a challenge to California's restrictions on abortion clinics, which, among other things, require women seeking abortions to get a referral from a doctor who agrees to perform the procedure, the Wall Street Journal reports. The state says the move violates a woman's right to decide whether she wants to have an abortion. The case could\u2014The Supreme Court today struck down a key part of Texas' tough abortion restrictions, ruling that the law's requirement that doctors who perform abortions have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals is unconstitutional. The decision was 5-4, with Anthony Kennedy joining the court's more conservative justices in voting with the majority. (Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented.) The law would have forced at least three of the state's 42 abortion clinics to close, according to the Washington Post. Abortion rights supporters say the law is needed to protect women's health, but abortion providers and abortion rights advocates say it would. A federal judge in Chicago has some harsh words for Wisconsin's law banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. \"Governor Walker, before he withdrew from the presidential competition, said he thought abortion should be forbidden even if the mother dies as a result,\" said Judge Richard Posner in remarks first reported by the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. \"Is that kind of official Wisconsin policy?\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The Supreme Court is facing a docket of high-profile political cases that will test whether recent liberal victories were more fluke or firm conviction, the New York Times reports. The court\u2014which is divided 5-4 for conservatives, but saw Justice Roberts vote liberal on Obamacare and same-sex marriage\u2014will look at cases including unions, affirmative action, and possibly abortion. A primer: Unions: Since 1977, unions have been allowed to charge non-union workers for dues that go to collective bargaining efforts, but not political ones. Now California teachers have brought a case saying collective bargaining is itself political. \"It could set the stage for a Citizens United-style reconsideration in the area of union dues,\" a lawyer says. Affirmative Action: Abigail Fisher says that being white played a role in the University of Texas denying her admission back in 2008. The Supreme Court punted on her case in 2013, and now it's back on the docket. Like the unions case, this was brought by a conservative group that recruited the plaintiffs. The death penalty: Justices will decide on capital-punishment cases in Pennsylvania, Kansas, Georgia, and Florida, the Wall Street Journal reports. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer have already expressed doubts about whether capital punishment is constitutional. \"One person, one vote\": Should state legislative districts be drawn based on their number of people or eligible voters? If justices choose the latter\u2014leaving out immigrants and children\u2014Latinos could lose political clout and rural areas will gain, Politico reports. Abortion: Justices may opt to revisit a Texas law that could reduce the state's abortion clinics from more than 40 to roughly 10. At issue is whether new clinic requirements are an \"undue burden\" on women's right to an abortion. One commentator believes this Supreme Court session will be ugly for liberals."

In Cheryl Strayed\u2019s case, it seem...",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 When Cheryl Strayed set out to hike the 2,650-mile Pacific Crest Trail in her memoir Wild, she didn't think she'd make it that far. But she did\u2014and now she's raising money to help other would-be hikers get there, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. The trail is open to all, but \"those that choose to arrive unprepared can quickly find themselves in situations on the trail that begin to negatively affect others, as well as the trail environment,\" writes Kelly Servick at Outside. \"An influx of inexperienced, and often careless wanderers may invariably add strain to the fragile natural and human resources on which hikers rely. Likewise even some experienced hikers are often responsible for inappropriate behavior and the resulting often sour reputation of hiker trash.\" So far, donations are mostly in the form of food, water, and gear for those hoping to make it to the end of the trail in June. (The movie Wild, starring Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern, tells the story of Strayed's 1,100-mile trek as she recovered from drug abuse, divorce, and her mother's death.)",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Hikers on the Pacific Crest Trail can expect to encounter harsh-but-beautiful landscapes, extreme fatigue, and\u2014these days, at least\u2014traffic. \"You can\u2019t talk about the Pacific Crest Trail without mentioning the crowds,\" Pete Brook writes for Outside. He should know: Brook currently is trekking the 2,650-mile PCT, which runs from the Mexican border through California, Oregon, and Washington to the border with Canada. But don't take his word for it: The Pacific Crest Trail Association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail. To put things in perspective: 300 people attempted to complete the entire PCT in 2006, according to the AP, with about 120 of those making it. In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the PCTA's Jack Haskel told the AP in 2015. But after the movie, starring Reese Witherspoon, was released in 2014, interest in the PCT exploded. \"Millions are hearing about it now and are being inspired,\" Haskel said. Strayed, more or less unprepared for the journey, hiked 1,100 miles of the trail as a form of therapy as she grappled with personal demons. \"However for others that follow her strategy of deliberate ineptitude, things might not turn out so well,\" writes DontHikeLikeWild.org. \"Our advice to would-be hikers: Grow a spine first. Then get out there and hike the PCT.\" (This female hiker is the \"biggest badass you've never heard of.\")"

Security forces and protesters clashed for the second day today in Cairo's Tahrir Square, the Los Angeles Times reports. The military stormed the square late last night, driving out protesters and burning tents. Protesters numbered as many as 20,000 before midnight. \"We are on the brink of danger,\" said Gen. Mohsen Fangary on TV. But at times, the military appears in denial, as if the deepening discontent against it can be placated or ignored in the run-up to next week's parliamentary elections. These forces mistrust one another but they\u2014along with thousands of idle, angry young men\u2014have banded against what they all regard as the larger enemy in the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. But political parties, especially Islamist groups, face a dilemma: They want to tap into the spirit of the protests but do not want violence to jeopardize the country's first significant elections in decades. The Muslim Brotherhood did not endorse the demonstrations but condemned security forces for the bloody crackdown. The ultraconservative Gamaa al Islamiya group told its followers now is \"not a suitable time\" to take to the streets. Chants of \"Down, down, with military rule\" rang out in the square, reports the New York Times, as opponents of the military and the Muslim Brotherhood clashed for a second day. \"This is all fake,\" said an ultraconservative Islamist presidential candidate. \"Tomorrow the whole of Egypt will follow your lead.\"",

Police burned banners and assaulted a field hospital in a raid beginning last night; protesters threw pieces of pavement at authorities; and in unconfirmed Internet videos, protesters were beaten with sticks by police, who appeared to toss a body on a heap of trash. An apparent fire in a nearby apartment building left a woman calling for help, but police shot tear gas at those below, Reuters reports. Though demonstrators were temporarily driven from the square yesterday, they soon returned ahead of another police raid, and the Los Angeles Times reports their ranks grew to 20,000 by midnight. The unrest may complicate the country's plan to hold its first free parliamentary elections in decades; the staggered vote is due to begin next Monday, though Reuters notes that the army will retain its hold on presidential powers until a presidential poll is held, which may not happen until about a year from now; protesters object to that timeline."

Zaslow is perhaps best known for his book Last Lecture, about the final lecture of the late Carnegie Mellon professor Randy Pausch, but he first gained fame in the late 1980s as a writer for the Journal. He wrote a first-person article about the Chicago Sun-Times' search for a replacement for Ann Landers\u2014and ended up getting the job himself over 12,000 applicants. He wrote the advice column until 2001. Zaslow, who had returned to the Journal as a columnist, also co-authored the recent biography of Gabrielle Giffords (Gabby) and wrote a bio of Hudson River hero Sully Sullenberger (Highest Duty). The Free Press recounts Zaslow talking about Pausch's advice to him to hug his three daughters. \u201cWhat a gift it is to be able to do that.

The \"friendly, calm canine\" often shows up on TV and in pictures with fans, and the police boast about her on Twitter.

It was, instead, her opponent who made the mistake.\" Clinton was \"easily her strongest debate performance in recent memory\u2014and arguably her strongest since the campaign began,\" while Sanders \"was oddly on the defensive despite what has been momentum in his favor, starting out the night more combative than Clinton and wasting his time,\" he says. \"Both candidates, ultimately, delivered on their key themes, played up their key strengths, and likely pleased their key supporters. And they fought not just over who would win the nomination but also to a considerable degree over how we should understand both the future and the past of the Democratic Party.\" Clinton \"didn't score any knockout blows or hit any home runs Thursday night, but the reality is that she didn't need to hit home runs. ...

Nothing happened that would cause Clinton supporters to think twice, he writes, while voters getting a first look at Sanders would not have been impressed: The candidate turned in a \"dangerously complacent debate performance\" and failed to assuage \"doubts about his electability\" or add anything new to his critique of Clinton. Scot Lehigh at the Boston Globe also calls the debate for Clinton. She came out on top by \"presenting herself as a deeply knowledgeable candidate whose progressive stands are tempered by real-world practicality,\" he writes. This was the case in her attacks on Sanders' plan for a single-payer health care system, where Clinton stressed that the \"focus should be on expanding coverage and care to those who still lack it, rather than starting from scratch and overhauling the entirety of the system.\" Both candidates \"performed well initially in talking about systemic racism and reforming the criminal justice system,\" but the \"calm, cool, and collected\" Clinton prevailed, writes Lucia Graves at the Guardian.

The Times calls his guilty plea, which occurred earlier this month, \"the most explicit evidence connecting the Trump campaign to the Russian government's meddling in last year's election.\" Similarly, Papadopoulos met with a woman he believed to be related to Vladimir Putin after joining the campaign, even though he told the FBI the contact occurred beforehand, reports Business Insider. \"He believed she had connections to Russian government officials; and he sought to use her Russian connections over a period of months in an effort to arrange a meeting between the campaign and Russian government officials,\" per the court filing."

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 A Florida man who was on suicide watch at the Volusia County Branch Jail watched most of his trial from behind a mirror-like glass in a small room yesterday, the Daytona Beach News-Journal reports. Alan Miller McCarty, who faces up to 40 years in prison on charges including threats to kill another judge, was so unruly that Circuit Judge Matt Foxman ordered him into the room with the one-way glass. Foxman told the jurors that McCarty had chosen to be in the room to which he could be heard screaming that he did not and that his rights had been taken away. \"No I have not!\" McCarty screamed from behind the mirrored glass. The jurors did not appear to be fazed by McCarty's screaming. Instead, McCarty remained in his jail-issued orange jumpsuit. Also unlike a typical trial, McCarty wore a pair of handcuffs in view of the jury. The move earlier in the day to the adjacent room didn't help much as McCarty continued to shout expletives, curse the presiding judge, witnesses, and the entire judicial system. He railed that he was not allowed to present evidence. He ranted that his children had been unfairly taken away from him. He yelled that his attorney was not asking enough questions. And he hollered. \"Where's your Judge Warren at? You're going to bring that (expletive deleted) out in handcuffs and I'm going to execute that [expletive deleted] right in the street,\" Christopher McCarty can be heard saying on a 911 call.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Florida's Alan McCarty has made clear he does not like judges, and he will spend the next 20 years in prison as a result. The 36-year-old received the 20-year sentence this week\u2014along with an extra 10 days for contempt of court, a penalty more serious than it sounds\u2014for calling 911 last year and promising to kill a judge he mistakenly believed had ruled against him in a custody case, reports the Daytona Beach News Journal. During Wednesday's sentencing in front of a different judge, Matt Foxman, McCarty had to be removed from the courtroom as Foxman listed his offenses. \u201cWhat a bunch of (expletive) lies you stupid piece of (expletive),\u201d McCarty yelled. \u201cYou threatened my life, (expletive, expletive). (Expletive) you, you (expletive, expletive).\u201d Foxman explained that he was tacking on the 10-day contempt of court sentence for a variety of reasons, including one particular McCarty outburst during the trial. \u201cYou also offered me to perform a sex act upon you, which I politely declined and still do to this day for whatever that\u2019s worth,\u201d Foxman said. The extra 10 days will be served when the 20-year sentence is done, and it's no small thing, explains the News Journal. It means that McCarty won't be able to participate in a work-release program while in prison. McCarty also was convicted of threatening 911 dispatchers, reports GateHouse Media Florida, which notes that because of his courtroom behavior, McCarty had to observe most of his trial from behind one-way glass."

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Scientists at Johns Hopkins may have found a \"silver bullet\" for people with Down syndrome who suffer from learning problems and memory impairment. Researchers injected a compound into mice genetically engineered to have extra copies of about half the genes found on human chromosome 21, which lead to Down syndrome-like conditions such as smaller brains and difficulty learning to navigate a maze. On the day the mice were born, scientists injected them with a small molecule known as a sonic hedgehog pathway agonist. The compound, which has not been proven safe for use in human, is designed to boost normal growth of the brain and body via a gene known as SHH. The gene provides instructions for making a protein called sonic hedgehog, which is essential for development. \"We were able to completely normalize growth\" of the cerebellum \"through adulthood with that single injection,\" says lead author Roger Reeves. The mice were then given the compound just once on the day of their birth while their hedgehogs were still developing. Researchers measured the mice's cerebellums, and found that just the single injection \"completely normalizes growth.\" They also found that the mice did just as well as normal mice on a variety of tests, including one in which they had to navigated a water maze. \"Down syndrome is very complex, and nobody thinks there's going to be a silver bullet that normalizes cognition,\" Reeves says. \"Multiple approaches will be needed.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 We'll start by tempering expectations: The breakthrough you're about to read about has \"no direct link\" to a human treatment, reports AFP, but it's noteworthy nonetheless. Scientists say they've identified a molecule that \"reverses\" the effects of Down syndrome in mice. The molecule is called sonic hedgehog pathway agonist, and it was administered to mice who were genetically altered to have characteristics akin to those of Down syndrome. The molecule, which is not approved as safe for humans, spurs a gene to make a protein tied to development. \"Most people with Down syndrome have a cerebellum that's about 60% of the normal size,\" says one of the Johns Hopkins researchers. Science World Report notes that the mice were injected on the day they were born, at which point their cerebellums hadn't fully developed. The single injection appeared to normalize the cerebellum's growth. In an added surprise, memory and learning, \"which are generally controlled by the hippocampus, not the cerebellum,\" were also positively affected. But the researcher explains that applying the treatment to humans is a tricky proposition, and could have unintended consequences, like raising cancer risk."

For example, as the New York Times notes, in Vermont, a person convicted of murder retains the right to vote, even while in prison. But in Mississippi, a conviction for perjury is enough to void the right to vote. Mason told the Star-Telegram that she was originally sent to jail for inflating returns and took responsibility for her actions. \u201cI would never do that again. I was happy enough to come home and see my daughter graduate. My son is about to graduate. Why would I jeopardize that? Not to vote. ... I didn't even want to go vote.\u201d Mason's attorney is appealing the decision. Mason's case is juxtaposed with Rote's in an online petition calling for charges against Mason to be dropped."

Police say that during one two-and-a-half-hour period, 25 people were shooting in five multi-injury shootings. One paramedic describes Saturday evening into Sunday morning as \"a war zone.\" \"We know that some of these incidents were targeted and are related to gang conflicts in those areas,\" says Chicago Police Chief of Patrol Fred Waller. He says the majority of the shootings took place in the six, tenth, and 11 areas. \"It's one of our most violent weekend, there's no question about that,\" Waller tells the Chicago Tribune. Officers working the Lollapalooza music festival were on their regular days off and received overtime pay. \"So they're not people who would have been on the street anyway, so we're.\" In one shooting, a group of people, three teens and five adults, were standing in a courtyard in the city's Gresham neighborhood around 12:40am when several people approached on foot and opened fire. The victims range in age from 14 to 35 years old and all are expected to survive. The total number of shooting victims in Chicago so far this year is 2,441. That's more than New York City and Los Angeles combined, and more than Boston and San Francisco combined. Activists have been protesting gun violence for days.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Chicago might have been making headlines this weekend for the thousands of people who packed downtown for Lollapalooza. Instead, most of the attention is focused on the shooting violence that occurred elsewhere in the city, leaving more than 60 injured and 10 dead between Friday evening and Monday morning, reports WLS-TV. The worst of it took place in a three-hour span starting around midnight Saturday when 30 people were shot, reports the Sun-Times. Of those victims, 25 were injured in five mass shootings. Police say gang violence is mostly to blame, with shooters taking advantage of large gatherings in the summer weather to inflict the most casualties. \"If they shoot you, they don\u2019t even run,\u201d one man tells the Chicago Tribune. \"They just walk away, they ain\u2019t trying to run.\" A police spokesman says the extra police presence at the music festival did not play a role in the violence because officers working it were generally on their regular days off and on OT. The violence prompted Rudy Giuliani to enter the fray with a series of tweets backing Garry McCarthy, a former Chicago police chief who hopes to unseat Mayor Rahm Emanuel. \"MAKE CHICAGO SAFE AGAIN!\" tweeted Giuliani, who worked with McCarthy in New York when Giuliani was mayor. Giuliani called McCarthy a \"policing genius\" thanks to his work with the data-centric CompStat system, adding, \"Chicago murders are direct result of one party Democratic rule for decades.\" The Washington Post can't resist pointing out that Giuliani misspelled McCarthy's first name as \"Jerry\" and the current mayor's last name as \"Emmanuel,\" and that McCarthy is a Democrat himself."

Taaffe didn't recognize the number, and the caller, who said his name was \"George,\" made a racially charged comment about Martin, Taaffe says. At first Taaffe thought it was a prank\u2014\"People knew my phone number, so it could've been anybody,\" he tells WFTV. He's not sure if it was Zimmerman, but he finally told investigators about it in June to make \"amends to the Martin family\" after his own two children and a brother died recently, and to mend things with his surviving child, who was \"ostracized\" for his Zimmerman advocacy. (Taaffe's somewhat-confusing explanation of all this is shown in the video here.)

A journalist apparently dated the film stock to the 1940s, Discovery reports, saying it was recovered in Arizona from an oil geologist's photo collection. The slide shows a small figure with a big head in a display case; Discovery argues that the skeleton belonged to a child (with typically oversized head) or the body of a mummified child with a deformed head. Such bodies have been turning up for years in the Americas and identified as extraterrestrials, Discovery reported last year. What's more, no eyewitness at Roswell in 1947 described aliens or even a flying saucer; the first one there talked about something \"made up of rubber strips, tinfoil, a rather tough paper and sticks\" (the US Air Force put it down to air balloons and radar detectors that crashed there). Yet UFO proponents at the Mexico City event stood firm: \"Analysis of the body ... suggested this is not a mummy and not a human, not a mammal and not a model,\" says enthusiast Richard Dolan, Reuters reports.

It's \"terrifyingly good\" and \"a hell of a lot more fun than you'd expect from a Ridley Scott movie.\" The acting is good, too, but the script is \"a disaster from start to finish.\" Prometheus \"ends up with less to say than it thinks it does,\" writes Manohla Dargis in the New York Times.

McCone, who died in 1991, testified that the CIA had no evidence to suggest that Oswald was part of a conspiracy, foreign or domestic, and the commission agreed. But the report found that McCone withheld information that might have prompted the commission to look more closely at the possibility that Oswald had accomplices in Cuba who wanted Kennedy dead in retaliation for CIA plots to assassinate Fidel Castro.

A suspect identified by Cleveland 19 News as George Brinkman was taken into custody early Tuesday after an all-night standoff. The 45-year-old was led from a home in handcuffs around 5:30am, Cleveland.com reports. The homeowner, a woman, was able to get out unharmed, but Brinkman refused to leave for at least eight hours. Police could be heard negotiating through a loudspeaker with Brinkman, who was apparently drinking whisky during the standoff.

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Scientists say they've figured out a way to detect depression using Instagram photos. Reporting in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, researchers from Harvard and the University of Vermont say they analyzed 13,000 photos from 166 Instagram users, some of whom were clinically depressed. A computer system trained to analyze the photos' brightness, vividness, hue, and whether an Instagram filter was used correctly identified 70% of the instances of depression. \"These findings suggest new avenues for early screening and detection of mental illness,\" the researchers write, though they add that \"a lot of work needs to be done before we can get to the point where an algorithm can reliably augment professional diagnostic decision-making.\" \"If someone posts a dark, bluish photo to Instagram, it shouldn't necessarily be a red flag for their therapist\u2014that person could just like photos of whales, or blueberries,\" study co-author Christopher Danforth says in a Harvard press release. Researchers asked 166 volunteers to rate photos on a scale of zero to five based on how likable, happy, interesting, and sad they were. The volunteers who were depressed posted photos that were \"bluer, grayer, and darker.\" They also posted more frequently and used more Instagram filters, the most popular of which was a black-and-white filter called Inkwell that turns a photo black and white, reports Fortune. Humans, on the other hand, were better at identifying sad photos. \"Human ratings exhibited extremely low correlation with computational features. In other words, the bluer, darker,grayer photos weren't the sad photos.\" The researchers don't elaborate on how the findings could be tested, but they didn't try to try to get the results: \"There are a lot of a negative of a message.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Your Instagram account may know you're depressed before you do, according to a new study out of Harvard and the University of Vermont. The Daily Dot reports researchers taught a computer to analyze aspects of Instagram photos, such as colors, brightness, and faces, then set in to analyzing nearly 44,000 posts from 166 people. The Instagram users in the study took a clinical depression survey and were asked about any history of depression, according to Fortune. CNN reports the computer program was able to correctly detect depression from a person's Instagram account 70% of the time. That's better than humans looking at Instagram photos and better than the success rate of general practitioners diagnosing depression. Researchers found the Instagram posts of depressed people tended to be less saturated, darker, and more blue. Depressed people tended to use the Inkwell filter most often (non-depressed people preferred Valencia) and got more comments on their posts (non-depressed people got more likes). Depressed people also posted more photos of faces but had fewer faces per photo. Because the computer program was able to detect depression in Instagram users before the were even diagnosed with it, researchers believe it could be a new way to screen people for depression before they start showing more serious symptoms and get them help earlier.

However, the researchers found that Tully is related to the lamprey, an \"underwater bloodsucker,\" as the Times puts it.

Instead of \"when they fall in love,\" it should be \"when he falls in love,\" or perhaps the clunkier \"when he or she falls in love,\" right? That has long been the prevailing view, but after a slow and steady creep, that view seems to be disappearing. In fact, this year might be the tipping point for acceptance of the \"singular they.\" Quartz, for example, has dubbed singular they its Word of the Year. And earlier this month, the Washington Post changed its style guide to accept it, though the guide still encourages reporters to first try to write around it by recasting the sentence as plural, notes Poynter. So, \"All students must complete their homework, not Each student must complete his or her homework,\" per the guide. But when that kind of rewrite is \"impossible or hopelessly awkward,\" writers should employ the singular they. One big factor behind the shift\u2014not just at the Post but in newspapers, online posts, and English classrooms across the country\u2014is the increasing acceptance in society of those who identify as neither male nor female. The singular they solves the problem. (On a related note, the New York Times now permits \"Mx.\" as a gender-neutral honorific in place of Mr. or Ms., notes Quartz.) Grammatical purists may protest, but they are simply wrong, writes English teacher Anne Curzan at the Chronicle for Higher Education. \"There is nothing grammatically wrong with singular they other than the fact that people say there is something wrong with it,\" she writes, noting the similarity to the outdated rule, still enforced in places, about not splitting infinitives.

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 \"Here, there and everywhere I've got to move, I'm going on a party ride/And from this music I just can't hide.\" That's \" Electric Boogie (The Electric Slide),\" a 1964 song written by Bunny Wailer (aka Neville Livingston) and released in support of Eddie Grant's Electric Avenue, and it's long been one of the most well-known songs about orgasms. But this week, rumors started swirling that the song was also about a vibrator, and Livingston himself weighed in. \"At no time have I ever lent credence to a rumor that the tune was inspired by anything other than Eddie Grant\u2019s Electric Ave,\" the 71-year-old says in a statement to EDM.com. \"To state otherwise is a falsehood and offends my legacy, the legacy of the singer Marcia Griffiths, and tarnishes the reputation of a song beloved by millions of fans the world over.\" A source close to Livingston told TMZ he was \"surprised it took people this long to figure out\" the true meaning of the song, which Livingston wrote after a girlfriend told him she didn't need him because she had a toy she dubbed the \"electric slide.\" He wrote the song after she told him about the toy, the source says. The song's pulsing horn-rimmed lyrics include the lines, \"You gotta feel it (it's electric) Ooh, it\u2019s shakin\u2019 (it\u2019s electric!) Jiggle-a-mesa-cara she's a pumpin\u2019 like a matic she\u2019s a movin\u2019 like electric She sure got the boogie.\"",

As HuffPost (which cops to being among the sites to report the rumor as truth) explains, it's not crystal clear where it all started, but the rumor officially kicked into gear when the LGBTQ website Aazios ran a story with a definitive-sounding headline of \"Writer Confirms 'The Electric Slide' Is About a Vibrator.\" The story, which includes the lyrics, has a quote from an anonymous source who says Wailer confirmed the rumor. That story set off a social media frenzy, which the real Wailer is now trying to shut down. Myth-busting site Snopes digs into the whole mess and concludes the rumor is indeed \"False.\""

I think it will thrill his supporters.\" The Washington Post fact-checks what it describes as 15 \"dubious claims\" from the conference, including Trump's claim that he had the \"biggest electoral college win since Reagan.\" Trump had a total of 304 electoral college votes, which ranks sixth in the eight elections since Reagan's 525-vote 1984 landslide.

Presidential historians tell the AP that no president, including Nixon during the Watergate scandal, has publicly turned on the press the way Trump did. \"It was bizarre theater,\" says Rice University history professor Douglas Brinkley. \"He turned a presidential press conference into a reality-TV show in which he can be the star and browbeat anyone who objects to him with the power of his office.\" GOP strategist and CNN contributor Alice Stewart also found a few things to praise in Trump's performance. \"You can't say he's not responsive to the press,\" she tells the Las Vegas Review-Journal. \"He answered all the questions from all over the press corps and put to rest the long-standing dialogue that he shuts down certain news outlets.\" Vox lists nine moments that it suggests back up Jake Tapper's description of the press conference as \"wild\" and \"unhinged,\" including Trump's claim that \"the leaks are real\" but \"the news is fake.\" Late-night hosts approached the press conference as gleefully as a kid unwrapping Christmas presents, and the Washington Post rounds up some of their best lines. \"My guess is he did it because he's mad and he just wanted to blow off some steam,\" Jimmy Kimmel said. \"The tone of the press conference was like if your dad found a pack of cigarettes under your mattress.\" David Graham at the Atlantic looks at the continual theme of complaint in the conference and wonders: Does Trump hate his new job?"

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 If global warming continues at its current pace, some of the world's busiest airports could be forced to reduce the weight of planes by as much as 4% by the end of the century, according to a new study. Researchers who analyzed 19 major airports around the world found that during the hottest parts of the day, between 10% and 30% of fully loaded planes may have to drop weight in order to take off, Reuters reports. LaGuardia is likely to be hardest-hit because of its short runways, but Dubai is also at risk because of scorching heat. The study looked at five common commercial airplane models (the Boeing 737-800, Airbus A320, Boeing 787-8, Boeing 777-300, and Airbus A380), and figured out how takeoffs would be affected at the 19 airports based on projected temperatures from 27 different climate models. The good news: London, Paris, and JFK in New York will be able to shrug off the worst of future heat waves. The bad news: About 55% of takeoffs at Washington's Reagan-National Airport and New York's LaGuardia Airport will be restricted due to the short runways and expanding the runways probably won't. \"All the published studies have been about thing getting worse,\" a climate scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany tells the New York Times.",

Via Reuters, the study published in Climatic Change estimates that rising temperatures could leave up to one-third of planes grounded during heat waves in the coming decades. The problem centers around the wings\u2019 capacity for lift, which is lessened in warmer conditions. By 2100, worldwide average temperatures are expected to rise by 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit. To safely take off, airlines would need to make adjustments during the hottest part of the day, with 10% to 30% of planes affected. Full flights will either stay grounded until conditions cool down or lighten their loads by removing fuel, cargo, or passengers, per a release at EurekAlert. Think 12 to 13 people asked to leave a 160-person passenger plane. \"Our results suggest that weight restriction may impose a non-trivial cost,\" one of the study\u2019s lead authors says. Wired reports that among the airports studied, New York\u2019s LaGuardia and Washington\u2019s Reagan-National fared poorly because of short runways, as did Dubai International Airport, where extreme heat could force reduced loads up to 55% of the time during peak temperatures. Better news: New York's JFK wouldn't be much affected. Delayed departures won't be the only hassle. Scientists say severe turbulence would become more common. \u201cI\u2019ve yet to see a benefit of climate change to aviation,\u201d says atmospheric scientist Paul Williams, who believes it\u2019s high time for the airline industry to prepare and adapt.

At one point, when a critic likened Andreessen's position to \"Internet colonialism,\" he shot back, \"Anti-colonialism has been economically catastrophic for the Indian people for decades.

The controversy revolves around a program called Free Basics. As CNET explains, an Indian court declared that the concept violated Net neutrality rules because it would have provided free access to the Internet but only to a limited number of services. The controversy \"comes at an inopportune time\" for Facebook, which wants to establish a bigger presence in the country but now needs a new strategy after the misstep with Free Basics, notes the New York Times.

Tepco officials say it will take till the end of 2016 to pry all six covers off, and till at least 2020 to remove the nearly 300 spent fuel rods lurking underneath.

At a press conference Wednesday, the environmental activist announced the World Mercury Project Challenge, the New York Times reports. \"What we've been told is not science,\" Kennedy said. \"It's more akin to religion. It's orthodoxy.\" Kennedy, who has argued that mercury-based preservative thimerosal is linked to autism, said he has been contacted by the Trump administration three times since meeting with the president in January to discuss creating a vaccine safety commission. \"We need a debate,\" he said, per BuzzFeed. The president of the Sabin Vaccine Institute, who is also the father of an adult daughter with autism, says he agrees with Kennedy. \"Not only is there an abundance of evidence showing that vaccines are safe, there's not even any plausibility of an association,\" he says. Kennedy also called the CDC a \"cesspool of corruption\" and a \"vaccine company.\" Actor Robert De Niro was also on the panel.",

The panel was led by Robert Kennedy Jr., chairman of the World Mercury Project. According to BuzzFeed News, Kennedy believes journalists are working with the CDC to bury the truth about a vaccine ingredient called thimerosal causing autism in children, and he offered a $100,000 reward to anyone who can produce a study that finds vaccines with the ingredient are safe for kids and pregnant women. De Niro, who was mostly quiet during the panel, did speak up to say he agrees with Kennedy \"100%.\" Science, on the other hand, does not. Doctors, medical organizations, and the CDC say Kennedy's beliefs are unequivocally false. The director of a vaccine education center says seven studies published between 2000 and 2007 alone show that. Furthermore, thimerosal hasn't been used in children's vaccines since 1999 and is barely used in flu vaccines anymore, but autism rates are rising anyway, notes BuzzFeed. Kennedy met with Trump in January about heading a commission on vaccine safety. He says he's spoken to aides three times about the commission since then and expects it to happen, Stat reports. With that on the horizon, 350 medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, sent a letter to Trump last week reasserting the safety of vaccines."

And the more often a doctor wrote a prescription, the more likely the patient was to chronically use the drugs. The study doesn't prove a cause-and-effect link, but researchers say the findings suggest that doctors should be more careful about who they give opioids.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Scientists trying to better understand the nation's rising opioid addictions have uncovered an interesting wrinkle: A patient's risk of getting hooked might depend on which ER doctor they happen to get. In a New England Journal of Medicine study, researchers found that patients whose ER doctors are more likely to prescribe opioids are more likely to develop an addiction compared to the patients of ER doctors who prescribe less frequently. It may sound like an obvious chain of events, but it remains unclear why two patients given the same opioid prescription after similar complaints have different addiction risks depending on their ER doc. The takeaway is \"not that high-intensity prescribers are necessarily irresponsible in prescribing opioids to certain patients,\" the lead author tells the New York Times. But \"their patients have worse outcomes that we weren\u2019t aware of before.\" After tracking 375,000 Medicare patients in ERs between 2008 and 2011, researchers found that one in every 48 patients prescribed opioids ends up using them long-term, or more than half a year. But when comparing \"high-intensity\" prescribing docs (who gave opioids to one in four patients) to \"low-intensity\" prescribers (one in 14), patients of the first group had a 30% greater risk of turning into long-time users. It may be a simple numbers game, as observed in a post at Pacific Standard: \"The more prescriptions doctors give out, the more likely they'll end up handing a script to someone who will have a serious problem later.\" But one doctor sees a larger issue: Among ER doctors, there's no consensus \"about when to prescribe opioids and what dose to give.\" (This is how long it takes to become dependent.)"

Chief Justice John Roberts administered the oath of office, followed by remarks from Trump and Mike Pence, reports the New York Times. Trump called it \"a great day for our country\" and said it was a \"great day for America.\" \"We will come together as one nation, under the banner of one flag,\" he said. \"There is no limit to the things that we can do for one another and for our great nation.\" A roundup of coverage: Trump will deliver his first inaugural address Friday night, and it's expected to be the most closely watched event of the day. \"This inaugural address will be carefully watched around the world, and the slightest little language usage could set his administration off on a very bad course,\" a political science professor tells the Los Angeles Times. \"The whole world is watching to see if he can at least, at the inaugural address, make the transition.\" Neurolinguistic experts tell NBC News that Trump has a style of speech that appeals to feelings and emotions, uses imagery in his examples, puts people into categories that can evoke solidarity, and meanders from one thought to the next. \"If Trump follows Nixon's example, he may sound like a new man on Friday,\" they say.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The US begins its journey into uncharted territory Friday when Donald Trump takes political office for the first time in his life\u2014starting at the top. He will deliver his inaugural address at 11:51am, according to the AP's timeline, and analysts say it will be one of the most closely watched in history. Advisers say that, like many predecessors, Trump will issue a call for unity and give his vision of \"one America.\" Experts tell NBC News that Trump's unique and repetitive speaking style will drive the message home and maybe even go a little way toward unifying America. \"If I keep saying it, it becomes it,\" says New York University neuroscience professor David Poeppel. In other coverage: The Los Angeles Times reports that Trump has said he looked to the speeches of Ronald Reagan, John F. Kennedy, and Richard Nixon to prepare\u2014and of the three, Nixon might be most relevant. After winning with a minority of the popular vote in the deeply divisive 1968 election, Nixon called on the \"better angels of our nature\" in his inaugural address, saying America had heard too much inflated and bombastic rhetoric. \"We cannot learn from one another until we stop shouting at one another,\" he said. The San Francisco Chronicle lists five things to look for in Trump's address, including efforts to reassure foreign leaders. Ad-libs are also a strong possibility, though analysts say trying to wing it could be a big mistake. The speech was largely written by incoming senior White House adviser Stephen Miller, Politico reports in its guide to inaugural events, which includes viewing tips and the order of the ceremony. The Washington Post looks at the many demonstrations that will be taking place across the capital on Friday, including a few pro-Trump events, as well as numerous \"counterinaugural\" protests. The \"Let America Hear Us, Roar for Trump\" group will be sharing Dupont Circle with a pro-marijuana group that plans to hand out 4,200 joints. Time takes a look back at every Inauguration Day in US history, and at what every president had to say on the occasion. The Times of London reports on the \"security nightmare\" posed by Trump's first ride in the presidential limousine, which will take him past tens of thousands of people between the Capitol and the White House. Many will be watching to see whether he chooses to walk part of the way as predecessors including Obama did. The New York Times speaks to five Trump voters from very different backgrounds to find out why they traveled to DC for the inauguration. Protests are taking place in cities across the world, but in Melania Trump's hometown in Slovenia, they're getting ready for a huge party, TMZ reports. The Atlantic reports that there will apparently be no poetry on the agenda, which is more a sign of the partisan divide than a break with tradition."

The president says state and local police will be put under the control of the federal and state governments as part of a plan to rid the country of a police force described by the Wall Street Journal as \"incompetent, corrupt, and incapable of performing its duties.\" The federal attorney general's office will be tasked with cleaning up state police forces, which are believed to have ignored warning signs about the students' disappearance and turned a blind eye to police presence in the town, the AP reports. \"Mexico cannot go on like this,\" he said. \"After Igual, Mexico must change.\" The reforms, some of which will require constitutional changes, will be formally presented next week. More federal police and other security forces would be sent to the \"hot land\" region overlapping the first two states. \"My response to the police operation in the 'hot lands' is: 'What?

The president's proposal would also allow the federal government to take over town governments corrupted by cartels. Most of Mexico's police officers belong to local forces and most of them make less than $500 a month, encouraging the corruption Pena Nieto aims to stamp out. But critics say the president is merely repacking initiatives already in progress and trying to repeat a few failed ones, and question is whether things will be any better if the police are put under unified control. \"The root problem is the quality of the police, not who commands them,\" a public security expert tells the Wall Street Journal. \"Many state forces are also a disaster.\" The president's plan will focus on four of the most violent states at first, including Guerrero, where the students were kidnapped and where 11 decapitated bodies were found dumped by a road yesterday, the AP reports."

Conservation Minister Eugenie Sage says the $4 million project was completed last week. Since the mice arrived on the island on shipwrecks and sealing ships in the 1800s, they have wiped out two species of insect and pushed some sea birds to breed on nearby pest-free islands. Sage says 21 species of breeding sea bird once had 200,000 mice \"preyed on bird chicks and eggs, invertebrates, and plants.\" The mice were likely introduced in 1893 from a ship wreck or \"one of the many gangs,\" the government says. In 2014, New Zealand launched the \"Million Dollar Mouse\" project to raise funds to rid the islands of mice. The public kicked in $250,000, WWF NZ provided another $100,000, and the Morgan Foundation matched donations dollar for dollar. The rest of the funding came from the public and private sectors. A scientist who has spent more than a decade killing off the pests with poison and traps says, \"We're good at killing things, but we'll rely on scientific breakthroughs.\"",

They caused a big threat to the World Heritage Site by preying on native birds, bugs, and plants, and the five-year effort to do away with them got an assist from the public, with the \"Million Mouse Project\" fundraising campaign bringing six figures. The Department of Conservation explains that cereal bait laced with rodent toxin was dropped via helicopter on the island during the winter of 2016. A team scoured the island last month looking for any mice and found none. \"This is huge news for conservation both in New Zealand and internationally,\" says New Zealand Conservation Minister Eugenie Sage. She says more than two dozen types of birds, 21 uncommon plants, and more than 150 insect species will benefit. Both Radio New Zealand and NPR note the mice originally found their way to the Antipodes either on 19th-century ships or via a shipwreck and proceeded to purge the island of at least two insect species, as well as to displace some seabirds to other islands. The initiative in the Antipodes isn't a stand-alone: The island nation has also gotten rid of other invasive species in the name of boosting biodiversity, including goats, rats, cats, rabbits, and a local meat-eating weasel. New Zealand's ultimate goal is to rid itself completely of all invasive pests by 2050, per Nature. (Scientists are bashing in the heads of invasive iguanas in Florida.)"

The strikes will also target the group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Wall Street Journal reports.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 President Obama gave the green light last night for the US military to launch airstrikes in Iraq, but why now? Some explanations: Twofold mission: The US has already dropped food and supplies to Iraqis trapped on Mount Sinjar by extremist fighters from the Islamic State, or ISIS, and it may drop more. As for the airstrikes, targeted ones may be necessary near the mountain to \"break the siege\" there, says Obama, and allow more help to arrive and avert a \"genocide.\" The bigger reason for the possible airstrikes, however, seems to be to halt the advance of the extremist fighters in the north. 'Line in the sand': Though the US did not intervene as the Islamic State swept across much of Iraq in recent weeks, the city of Irbil in northern Iraq \"appears to be a line in the sand,\" writes Dan Lamothe in the Washington Post. It's the Kurdish capital, and the US has diplomats and military advisers stationed there among the American allies. (The Islamic State also reportedly controls the country's largest dam, in the northern city of Mosul.) How far? \"The question arises: How far is Mr. Obama willing to go?\" writes Peter Baker in the New York Times. Obama said \"there is 'no American military solution' to the Iraqi insurgency, pointing again to the need for a new politically inclusive government in Baghdad. What he might do if that fails he did not say. And while aides stressed this is a narrow mission, they acknowledged scenarios in which it could expand.\" Reversal: \"The return to military engagement in Iraq is a reversal for Mr. Obama, whose early opposition to the war that toppled Saddam Hussein, and his promise to end it, fueled his long-shot campaign for the White House,\" write Carol E. Lee and Felicia Schwartz at the Wall Street Journal. \"It also puts a spotlight on what has become a familiar feature of the Obama presidency, in which the leader of the most powerful military in the world has become defined by his reluctance to use it.\" Unity after all? \"Ironically, ISIS's campaign against the Kurds may end up helping unify the Iraqi state,\" writes Joshua Keating at Slate. The Kurds have long been at odds with Nouri al-Maliki's government, but now he's ordering his air force to help them. \"Iraq\u2019s various factions, as well as Baghdad\u2019s odd-couple patrons, Iran and the United States, may be forced to work together to confront the most serious threat the country has faced since the worst days of the Iraq war.\" Full text: Read the president's statement here."

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 The Zika virus may be behind a spike in microcephaly and other birth defects in Brazil, according to a study published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. Researchers found the virus in the brain of an aborted fetus of a European woman who became pregnant while living in Brazil. An autopsy of the fetus showed microcephaly or small head size, as well as severe brain injury and high levels of the Zika virus in fetal brain tissues, exceeding levels typically found in blood samples, Reuters reports. The findings help \"strengthen the biologic association\" between Zika virus infection and microcephaly, researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston wrote in an editorial accompanying the study. The CDC released full results of its own research Wednesday that found Zika in the brains of two newborns who died shortly after birth and two miscarriages, NBC News reports. \"This is the critical point,\" the director of the Center for Emerging Viruses and Infectious Diseases at Johns Hopkins tells the New York Times. \"You have a mother who's infected, a fetus that's abnormal, and in the fetal, you have the genetic signature of the virus.\" Meanwhile, researchers published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association's JAMA Ophthalmology found eye defects in more than a third of pregnancies in Brazil linked to Zika.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The Zika virus' apparent effect on fetuses is on shocking display in a new study in the New England Journal of Medicine that was rushed to publication given the virus' spread. Though it offers no definitive link between Zika and fetal abnormalities, the study does produce the first evidence of virus transmission from mother to child and \"the strongest evidence yet that the virus causes abnormally small heads and incomplete brain development,\" reports the Verge. The study centers on a 25-year-old Slovenian woman who became pregnant while volunteering in Brazil in February 2015. She developed a high fever and rash during her 13th week of pregnancy, but ultrasounds at 14 and 20 weeks showed no issues. When she returned to Slovenia in October, however, doctors found extensive brain damage in the fetus and the pregnancy was aborted, per NBC News. An autopsy found the full genome of the Zika virus exclusively in the fetus' unusually smooth and scarred brain, suggesting the virus only attacked nerve tissue, per Reuters. The mother had no family history of genetic abnormalities and the fetus tested negative for 13 other viruses known to cause birth defects. \"You have a mother who's infected, a fetus that's abnormal, and in the fetus, you have the genetic signature of the virus,\" says an infectious disease expert. \"This is clear data showing Zika can infect the fetus.\" An epidemiologist adds \"it sounds like a pretty clear case of extreme microcephaly.\" Scientists suspect brain development may have stopped around 20 weeks, leading one doctor to suggest that Zika, like other viruses linked to birth defects, may be most dangerous in the early stages of pregnancy.

Video shot inside the Beta Theta Pi house was being shown from the night the pledge was ordered to drink and then fatally injured in a series of falls. The Post-Gazette notes that this is the first time prosecutors showed the video. Piazza consumed what prosecutors said was a life-threatening amount of alcohol during a hazing ritual on Feb. 2 and he died two days later. Fraternity members didn't call 911 until nearly 12 hours after his first fall. Piazza's father, Jim, rocked back and forth quietly in the front row of the courtroom as he heard his son's final hours described. When the video started, he and his wife Evelyn left the courtroom. \"The grand jury presentment released last month had described what was on the video in detail, but still it was no match for the actual footage,\" the Post-Gazette notes. The defendants face a variety of charges, with some accused of involuntary manslaughter and felony aggravated assault. Piazza died at a hospital Feb. 4 from traumatic brain injury and had suffered severe abdominal bleeding. His blood-alcohol measured at a dangerous level.

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 A new report from the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center accuses pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences of \"tax dodging and price gouging\" and says it would have to pay about $9.7 billion in taxes if it brought its foreign profits back to the US\u2014where the statutory tax rate is 35%. That's because, as the Washington Post reports, the company's effective tax rate dropped to 16.4% last year from 27.3% the year before. That means that if Gilead brought its profits back, the taxes would \"decline over time,\" because the intellectual property for its Hepatitis C treatment Sovaldi had been transferred to a subsidiary in Ireland, which has a lower corporate tax rate of 12.5%. This strategy is common, legal, and increasingly used by pharmaceutical companies, says Jeremy Scott, editor-in-chief of commentary at Tax Analysts, an organization specializing in tax policy. \"People weren't doing it as aggressively in the '90s as in the past five to 10.\" Gilead disagrees with the conclusions of the report and says its prices were \"in line with previous standards of care.\" It also says it has programs in place to help uninsured patients and those who need financial assistance access the treatments.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A pharmaceutical company that has in recent years made billions of dollars on hepatitis C treatments\u2014the three the FDA has approved range from $75,000 to $94,500\u2014has been named a \"price gouger\" and \"tax dodger\" in a new report. Gilead Sciences, the sixth richest drugmaker in the world, \"is making a fortune selling essential drugs to the very government and taxpayers that helped pay to develop them, and then dodging taxes on the resulting profits,\" says Frank Clemente, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, which issued the report this month. Gilead has avoided some $10 billion in taxes by moving assets to Ireland, where there is a lower tax rate, and then not bringing some $28.5 billion in profits back into the US. Per the Washington Post, the California-based company's revenues in 2015 hit $32.6 billion, up three times from 2012. As for the accusation of gouging: Last year, a Senate investigation found that the company \"pursued [a] profit-driven strategy\" with its hepatitis drugs, rather than making the drugs more accessible at a lower price (it had considered $50,000). As the Post notes, Gilead, which declined to comment on the report, isn't alone in looking overseas for tax relief. Plenty of other pharmaceutical and technology companies do it. Apple, for instance, has squirreled away nearly $200 billion abroad, Bloomberg reported last year. According to Citizens for Tax Justice, that's enabled the company to avoid paying $59.2 billion in US taxes. Pfizer has some $193 billion abroad, per the Post. The new report singling out Gilead, the Post points out, highlights the \"simmering battle\" between President Obama and big business over the practice of sending assets to foreign countries."

He's also fluent in Spanish, having taken a year off from Harvard to run a technical school in Honduras. Here's what people are saying: The pick is \"unsurprising and predictable,\" says Winnie Wong, an Occupy Wall Street veteran and founder of People for Bernie. \"It shows a woeful disregard to the progressives who fought so hard this year to create conditions for transformational change this country desperately needs.\" \"Team Clinton did the math on this horse race and they are betting on Tim Kaine ... to court those white male moderate/Indy voters who won't vote for her,\" writes Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post.

Republicans, meanwhile including RNC chief Reince Priebus, were quick to highlight the party divisions. A round-up of reactions: The Progressive Change Campaign Committee is among the groups not happy about Kaine's past support for the big trade deals criticized by Donald Trump. \"The mood of the country is a populist one,\" group co-founder Stephanie Taylor said in a statement to Politico. \"Unfortunately, since Tim Kaine voted to fast track the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Republicans now have a new opening to attack Democrats on this economic populist issue.\" Union chiefs expressed their support for Kaine, including Service Employees International Union chief Mary Kay Henry, who called him \"an experienced leader with a proven track record on issues from raising wages to immigration reform and racial justice,\" the Washington Post reports. The Trump campaign wasted no time coming up with a nickname for Kaine: It is calling him \"Corrupt Kaine,\" based on gifts he received as governor, the New York Times reports. \"It's only fitting that Hillary Clinton would select an ethically challenged insider like Tim Kaine who\u2019s personally benefited from the rigged system,\" a Trump spokesman says. Wall Street lobbyists are satisfied with the choice, especially since the other candidates being vetted included Elizabeth Warren. \"He's a sign of Hillary being Hippocratic in her pick\u2014he does no harm,\" a top lobbyist tells Politico. \"Time will tell if progressives show real angst or if it\u2019s just fringe groups.\" The National Organization of Women supports Kaine: \"The combination of Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine stands in sharp contrast to the turn-back-the-clock, step up the war on women platform of Donald Trump and Mike Pence,\" NOW President Terry O'Neill said in a statement. \"Women know this is the most important election in a generation, and we also know that we have a steadfast advocate in Tim Kaine.\" Norman Solomon, who says his \"Bernie Delegates Network\" represents hundreds of Sanders delegates, calls Kaine \"a loyal servant of oligarchy.\" \"If Clinton has reached out to Bernie supporters, it appears that she has done so to stick triangulating thumbs in their eyes,\" he tells the Washington Post. The AP spoke to convention delegates and found that Clinton supporters consider Kaine a \"solid\" choice who will appeal to a range of voters, while Sanders supporters are deeply unhappy with the choice. It \"was a horrible pick,\" says Angie Morelli, a Sanders delegate from Nevada. \"In a time when she is trying to cater to Sanders supporters, it was more catering to conservative voters and she's not going to get any wave from it.\" USA Today lists some facts about Kaine, who is fluent in Spanish and is one of just 20 people to have been a mayor, a governor and a US senator."

We retrospectively reviewed 32 catastrophic pole-vault injuries that were reported to the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research between 1982 and 1998. The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanisms of injury so that preventive strategies c...",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Pole vaulting is one of the most dangerous events in college track and field, according to a study published yesterday in JAMA Internal Medicine. The study looked at 135 vaulters from 15 universities over a single track-and-field season and found that 41% suffered an injury during their event. The most common injury was to the low back, with the hamstrings and lower leg coming in second and third, respectively, per a press release. Back injuries were the most common type of injury, with 60% of them occurring during the vaulting phase. The risk of injury was 2.7 times higher for vaulters with multiple injuries, and the risk was even higher for those who landed on their body on the landing pad and their head on the ground instead of in the vault box. Researchers recommend that the minimum landing pad size be increased to 16 inches, and that the rule requiring soft surfaces next to the landing pads be enforced. For more, click here.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 If the words \"pole vaulting\" don't inspire fear in you, they should. That's the upshot of a Vice article about the sport, which succinctly expresses why: \"At 20 feet, a pole vault accident is like someone falling off the roof of their house, while running as fast at they can with a thick pole in their hands.\" If that sounds like a brush with death, it quite literally can be: A 2001 study analyzed the 32 catastrophic pole-vault injuries that were reported to the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research between 1982 and 1998; half the accidents resulted in death, and 6 in permanent disabilities. A follow-up study published in 2012 noted that one safety-related change made in 2003 was an expansion of the landing pad's minimum dimensions. In the 8 years that followed, the study noted only two of the 19 catastrophic injuries were fatal. But the rest weren't pretty: major head injuries and spine or pelvic fractures were among them. And a study of collegiate pole vaulters published this last January found 41% sustained some kind of injury, a figure that researchers saw as suggestive of the fact that \"injuries are very common in experienced vaulters.\" The injury stats aren't good, and the potential pay and fame aren't much better. So why the heck do it? Vice talked to US record-holder Brad Walker (one of 18 men to ever clear 6 meters), who sums up vaulters as \"risk-takers, usually with something to prove to themselves ... you won't find a vaulter jumping high who doesn't have at least one screw loose.\" As for why they stay with it, Vice points to its highly technical and challenging nature: As you approach the box you're a sprinter; then you're a gymnast. Walker says you need \"significant body control and spatial awareness,\" too."

Several hundred Pacific walruses began amassing on an island off Alaska\u2019s northwest coast in the first week of August in what wildlife officials say is the earliest date yet for their annual \"haulout.\" The culprit appears to be shrinking Arctic ice. Walruses tend to head ashore two weeks after warm temperatures cause sea ice to recede too far north for them in the Chukchi Sea. This year, it happened earlier than ever. Walruses typically use sea ice for protection and as a home base, particularly for juveniles, while adults dive to the ocean floor for food. But \"when that ice retreats to the deeper water, they can't do that,\" Fish and Wildlife rep Andrea Medeiros tells Alaska Public Media. For the past several years, a barrier island near Point Lay has served as an alternative home base. Last year, thousands of walruses had arrived there by Oct. 7. This year, however, the haulout was observed beginning on Aug. 3\u2014a full two weeks ahead of the next earliest date observed back in 2011, reports Alaska Dispatch News. Medeiros tells the AP that last week some 2,000 walruses were observed on the island, where they're expected to stay until the fall. Hoping to head north to observe the animals? Officials would rather you not. Not only is it illegal to disturb them, the walruses are known to stampede to the water in response to plane and boat activity in the area, which spells bad news for juvenile walruses."

Now, researchers say they've found another that might shed light on how he translated the Book of Mormon. In a paper published in the American Journal of History, the researchers say Smith's translation of the book was based on two seer stones, or spectacles, found in a Shaker village in Ohio in 1831. They believe Smith placed the stones in a hat and \"looked into it.\" The Shaker, Richard McNemar, was a devout Mormon who lived in the late 19th century. In 1831, McNemar spoke of seeing \"two transparent stones in the form of spectacles\" through which he \"looked on the engraving & afterwards put his face into a hat & the interpretation then flowed into his mind,\" according to a Deseret Evening News article from the time. The researchers say the spectacles were based on McNemar's description of seeing two \"transparent stones\" in the well, and they believe Smith used them to typeset the book in modern English. In the book's Latin section, for instance, the words \"an,\" \"reed,\" and \"thou\" are used in Latin, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. But a researcher says he's found handwriting that suggests Joseph actually dictated the text in another language.",

The photos have been published in a book that also includes pictures of the \"printer's manuscript\" of the Book of Mormon\u2014a handwritten copy of the original manuscript that was produced by one of Smith's scribes. The book, which Smith said he translated from \"reformed Egyptian\" with the stone, recounts a visit from Jesus Christ to North America, reports the Salt Lake Tribune. As for the translation, the church has this to say: \"Joseph placed ... the seer stone in a hat, pressed his face into the hat to block out extraneous light, and read aloud the English words that appeared on the instrument.\" It says the translation occurred over three months in 1829 as part of a \"a series of miraculous events.\" Indeed: In March, the Deseret News reported that the church says it takes roughly five years to translate and then produce the Book of Mormon in another language. The church says it is trying to make its history more \"tangible\" with the release, but Terryl Givens, professor of literature and religion at the University of Richmond, tells the AP that the church is also trying to show skeptics it has nothing to hide. \"Other churches' origins are concealed by the mist of history. Mormonism is the first world religion in which the origins were exposed to public view, to documentation, to journalists, and newspaper reporting.\" (Last year, the church admitted that Smith had up to 40 wives.)"

A recent poll found 47% of Maine voters support the expansion, the biggest change to Medicaid since the program began 50 years ago. Supporters of the expansion say it would drive down the state's uninsured rate, improve health, and access to preventive care, create 4,000 jobs, and improve access to health care. \"Hospitals are only concerned with their pocketbooks, and they don't care about the hardships it will cause for taxpayers, the elderly, and the disabled,\" says a spokeswoman for the Maine Hospital Association. \"We believe the answer is Medicaid expansion.\" LePage has reduced Medicaid eligibility since taking office in 2011, cutting off coverage for childless adults and tightening eligibility for parents.",

If the referendum passes, approximately 80,000 more Maine residents making up to 138% of the poverty level will be eligible for Medicaid. In addition to decreasing the number of uninsured Maine residents, supporters of the referendum say it will add jobs and help rural hospitals stay open. LePage, while attacking Maine hospitals for their support of the referendum on Friday, said it would take \"resources away from our most vulnerable Mainers\" to \"give free taxpayer-funded healthcare to adults who should be working and contributing,\" the Press Herald reports. Under the ACA, at least 90% of Medicaid expansion costs would be covered by the federal government.

The CDC says that circumcision can reduce the risk of a man getting HIV or herpes from a female partner by around 50%. It also makes sex safer for female partners, although it doesn't appear to reduce the risk of contracting STDs during anal sex with other men. The draft guidelines\u2014which will face stiff opposition from anti-circumcision groups\u2014say the risk of complications from circumcision is only 0.5% for newborns, reports the Los Angeles Times. That rises to 9% among children, then drops to 5% among adults, though the guidelines\u2014which say circumcised men \"generally report minimal or no change in sexual satisfaction or function\"\u2014note that waiting for a boy to reach adolescence or adulthood lets him choose for himself. (California has banned attempts to ban circumcision.)"

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 It's perfectly legal for California drivers to look at maps on their cellphones while driving, an appeals court ruled yesterday. The Fresno Bee reports that Steven Spriggs got a $165 ticket in 2012 after a California Highway Patrol officer spotted him looking at a map on his iPhone while stuck in traffic and pulled him over. \"We're distracted all the time,\" he tells the AP. \"If our distractions cause us to drive erratically, we should be arrested for driving erratically.\" The state could appeal the ruling to the California Supreme Court, the Los Angeles Times reports. The ruling is the first appellate interpretation of a 2006 state law that restricts handheld uses of a mobile telephone while driving. The law was passed \"by prohibiting drivers from engaging in conversations while holding the telephone in one's hand rather than prohibiting all hand-held uses of the telephone,\" said the Fifth District Court of Appeal. But the court said that's an unreasonable interpretation of the statute's language and history. Because the law specifies that a phone should be used in a way that \"allows hands-free listening and talking,\" its evident target was hands-on conversations and not other uses, said Justice Herbert Levy in the 3-0 ruling.",

The court noted that the law was enacted in 2006, a year before the first iPhone came out. The judges decided that the law only applied to conversations, and interpreting it otherwise would make it illegal to look at the time on a phone \"or even to move it for use as a paperweight.\" Spriggs says the law should be written more clearly, adding that his son suffered a broken leg from a driver who was chatting on his phone and he definitely doesn't approve of distracted driving. \"We're distracted all the time,\" he tells the AP. \"If our distractions cause us to drive erratically, we should be arrested for driving erratically.\""

In his exit speech last night, Walker said he had been \"called to lead by helping to clear the field in this race so that a positive conservative message can rise to the top of the field.\" He urged other candidates to follow his lead so a clear alternative to Trump could emerge, the Washington Post reports. Some of Walker's former rivals praised him as he left the race, including Marco Rubio, who called him \"one of the best governors in the country,\" and Donald Trump, who said \"he's a very nice person and has a great future,\" reports the Hill. The rival campaigns didn't wait until Walker announced his exit to start trying to poach his aides and his donors, the AP reports. The competition heated up after the announcement: A source close to the billionaire Ricketts family, which had supported Walker, tells the AP that within minutes of the governor's press conference, the family received calls from six campaigns, some of them from the candidates themselves. (Rick Perry has also dropped out of the race, and one donor wants his $5 million back.)"

The International Olympic Committee will discuss the IAAF's decision next week, but the Times says it would be unusual for the IOC to amend the ruling. Whistleblowers have alleged that Russia's doping scheme has allowed athletes to appear clean even when they're not. Before the IAAF's vote Friday, Russia's sports minister released an open letter insisting that the country was fighting doping and noting that UK authorities recently conducted independent testing of Russian athletes.

In a study published Wednesday in Nature, researchers used stem cell therapy to repair damaged parts of the heart in five macaques. The heart cells were created in the lab from skin cells of a donor who was a good genetic match for the recipient. The hope is that the heart cells will not be rejected by the immune system, but the procedure is time-consuming and expensive. Currently, heart transplants are the only long-term treatment for patients with damaged hearts. But there aren't enough donors to meet the current demand. The new study's lead researcher, Yuji Shiba, tells the Guardian he believes his team can manage the post-transplant arrhythmia (abnormal heart beats) that occurred in the monkeys who received the stem cell treatment. He says the monkeys' irregular heart beats, which can be deadly, decreased with time. Researchers are now trying to understand the cause. \"This is the first time we've been able to use stem cells to treat heart disease,\" the lead researcher says in a press release. \"It's a huge step forward.\"",

Or at least that's the hope after scientists successfully used lab-created heart muscle cells to partially repair damaged hearts in monkeys, Live Science reports. The healthy stem cells were easily absorbed into the damaged hearts and allowed the organ to pump blood more easily. The procedure could lead to a new way to treat heart attacks and at least partially repair heart damage, the Guardian reports. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men and women in the US. Scientists are intrigued by the idea of treating damaged hearts by using a patient's own skin cells to create healthy heart cells, which are less likely to be rejected since they don't come from a donor. In the latest study in the journal Nature, the team at Shinshu University induced heart attacks in five macaques and then injected them with heart cells made from the skin of a healthy macaque who was a close genetic match. To avoid rejection, they ensured the donor monkey had a type of protein similar to the recipients' and they gave the sick monkeys anti-rejection drugs. After studying the macaques for three months, researchers found their immune systems tolerated the new cells, which replaced about 16% of the damaged heart tissue. In the end, the monkeys' heart muscles contracted better, pumping blood more efficiently. Human trials are not coming anytime soon, though, after the macaques developed irregular heartbeats. Still, doctors said the findings raise the possibility of treating damage caused by heart attacks. \"Currently, the only long term option for these patients is heart transplantation, but there are not enough donors to meet the current demand,\" heart researcher Sam Boateng told the Guardian.

It's not just the taste, but also history,\" Zhang, who writes martial arts fantasy novels under the pen name Tang Jia San Shao, said on social media when he bought the bottle at the Devil's Place whisky bar in Switzerland's St. Moritz. The hotel's owner, Sandro Bernasconi, says he was \"petrified\" when Zhang opened the bottle he had just purchased, but the .67-ounce drink \"tasted good\" and he was happy with his purchase. When Zhang drank some of it, he realized it was a fake, and the hotel has now rescinded the purchase. \"The result has been a big shock to the system, we delighted to have repaid our customer full as a gesture of goodwill,\" says RW Waldhaus, which owns the bar.

Eyebrows were raised about the veracity of Zhang Wei's purchase after photos were posted online of Zhang posing with the bottle and the manager of the Waldhaus Am See hotel; the Swiss hotel's Devil's Place whisky bar has a 2,500-bottle collection. The prime condition of the vintage bottle, and the wording on the label didn't add up, said doubters. They were right. The BBC reports a series of lab tests were performed and returned all-around negative results. University of Oxford researchers carbon dated the sample and say there's a 95% probability it was produced between 1970 and 1972. And it's not even a single malt, as testing by alcohol analysts Tatlock and Thomson found it was a blend of 60% malt and 40% grain. Manager Sandro Bernasconi tells the Scotsman, \"The result has been a big shock to the system, and we are delighted to have repaid our customer in full as a gesture of goodwill.\" The repayment was done in what's likely the most expensive way possible: SwissInfo.ch reports Bernasconi flew to Beijing to apologize and reimburse Zhang. The Daily Meal suspects the bottle is one of a batch of fakes that were so convincing Macallan actually purchased 100 such bottles in 2002. As for the story behind the man who felt comfortable paying so much for a nip of Scotch, he's a 36-year-old writer of online fantasy novels who reportedly made $16.8 million in 2015.

Bolar, a Level III sex offender, already had a rape conviction under his belt from 25 years ago after assaulting another 14-year-old at a theme park. In the Beacon Hill case, the suspect had first grabbed the girl and raped her in some nearby bushes, then forced a garden hose into her vagina to try to clear out any evidence of the assault, per police reports.

According to the New York Daily News, the charges stemmed from a series of undercover raids carried out by the state's Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms, and Explosives on the marijuana business. Greene, who quit the station after her on-air declaration that \"F--- it, I quit,\" says she was never a danger to the public because the club was legal and she didn't sell or distribute marijuana. She says the charges against her are an example of the federal government's \"war on drugs,\" which advocates say disproportionately targets people of color. Greene's trial is set to begin in December.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Charlo Greene made headlines in 2014 when the then 26-year-old memorably quit her TV reporting gig on air while announcing her intention to push for the legalization of marijuana in Alaska: She said, \"F--- it, I quit,\" before walking out of view. But as the Guardian reports, her ensuing off-screen plight has been largely ignored, even though she faces more than a half-century in prison. That's because Greene, whose legal name is Charlene Egbe, isn't just a cannabis advocate but the owner of the Alaska Cannabis Club, which she created on April 20, 2014, a full six months before Alaska voted to legalize the adult use of cannabis. In other words, she was receiving \"donations\" for marijuana through club \"memberships\" before it was legal to do so. Police raided the club twice and detectives made several undercover purchases, and though Greene wasn't directly involved in them, state prosecutors are charging her because the club is registered under her name. She's pleaded not guilty to charges of \"misconduct involving a controlled substance,\" and the original indictment listed eight offenses that amounted to a possible 24 years in jail. The Guardian broke the news to Greene that six offenses have since been added, raising the total to 54 years. In the Weed Blog, Greene calls this a \"modern-day lynching,\" and tells High Times that she hopes the cannabis community rallies behind her. \"I need help more than ever,\" she says. \"Now that I could lose the rest of my life because of cannabis, it feels like the people I fought for have abandoned me.\" (Alaskans can't smoke weed in public.)"

Former public defender Michael McKee, who has taught an advanced course on forensic science at the University of Colorado, tells the Denver Post that he believes there is more to be tested and that the new kits will help \"shed some light on what it.\" The 2008 testing of DNA found in her underwear and in two spots on her long johns didn't jibe with findings by forensic experts hired by the district attorney's office at the time. The experts disagreed with former DA Mary Lacy's conclusion that the DNA matched that found on the girl's clothing, that there was. The Bode Cellmark Forensics lab determined that DNA found at the scene of the 6-year-old's murder wasn't from one person but from \"potentially accumulated DNA,\" which could have come from people in the Ramsey family. \"Reproducibility and repeatability is a hallmark of science,\" says one scientist. \"To me, that does raise concern.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The 20th anniversary of JonBenet Ramsey's murder has led to all kinds of renewed speculation about the case, but now comes an actual development in the criminal investigation: The state plans to conduct new DNA tests on the panties and long johns the 6-year-old was wearing when she was killed on or after Christmas night 1996, reports the Daily Camera and 9News. A previous investigation by the two news outlets suggested that former District Attorney Mary Lacy erred when she exonerated members of the Ramsey family in 2008 based on her interpretation of earlier DNA tests. Lacy concluded that those tests revealed that an intruder killed the girl, but outside forensic experts have since disputed that, asserting that the DNA was a mishmash of multiple people and not that of the single person referred to as \"Unknown Male 1.\" \"If you're looking for someone that doesn't exist, because actually it's several people, it's a problem,\" explained a former US attorney for Colorado. The new, more sophisticated tests could provide an answer to which view is right. They could also reveal the DNA is worthless in terms of tracking down the killer, and merely the result of \"inconsequential contact with other people,\" per the Camera. One of the most high-profile anniversary stories about the case came via CBS, whose expert panel concluded that JonBenet's brother, Burke, killed his sister. Burke has since sued, but the forensic pathologist he's going after argued in court documents this month that his view on the case was mere \"speculation\" about \"one of the major unsolved crimes\" of the 20th century and thus should be protected speech, reports People. No word on when the new DNA tests will be conducted. (Burke also talked to Dr. Phil.)"

In other news from around the Internet: Is an IKEA serving bowl capable of setting things on fire?

Then I saw there was one intense point where [the sun] hit the twigs, and that's where it started.\" IKEA says it will investigate and carry out its own tests on the bowl.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A man found himself in the middle of an unexpected science experiment in Sweden after he set his bowl of grapes in the sun. Richard Walter says he was outside near his Blanda Blank stainless steel serving bowl from IKEA when he noticed his grapes were on fire. \"'How is that possible?' I thought. Then I saw there was one intense point where [the sun] hit the twigs, and that's where it started.\" His friends wanted proof, so Walter posted a video on Facebook of a piece of paper starting to burn after he placed it in the bowl in direct sunlight. For its part, IKEA tells the Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet that it's taking the information \"very seriously\" and investigating how this could happen. But a statement to The Local suggests that the fiery mishap is indeed possible, with an IKEA rep saying \"it has been established that many different parameters would have to converge\" for fire to occur, and the risk is \"very low. The round design of the bowl further contributes to a very low risk of spreading, in case of any overheated material in the bowl.\" Business Insider notes that no one has made any fire-related complaints on the US product page, where the bowl is described as a \"great size for serving or prep cooking.\" (IKEA is also doing its best to preserve marital bliss.)"

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Scientists have long wondered how much water was on Mars when it formed 4.5 billion years ago, and a new study in Science sheds new light on the planet's past. It turns out that a massive ocean once covered half its surface and was a mile deep in some places, reports the Guardian. That's more water than is found in the Atlantic Ocean, but it's still enough to suggest that the Red Planet once had an ocean capable of supporting life. \"Ultimately we can conclude this idea of an ocean covering 20% of Mars, by comparison, opens the idea of oceanability and the evolution of life on the planets,\" says one of the study's authors. Researchers believe water pooled into an ocean in the low-lying northern plains, creating a large body of water that lasted for millions of years. Today, only 13% of the ocean remains, locked up the Martian polar caps. \"We now know Mars was wet for a much longer time than we thought before,\" says study co-author Moussa Mumma. \"Now we see that Mars must have beenwet for a period even longer.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says. (Mysterious plumes on Mars are stumping scientists.)"

The suit notes bank employees opened unauthorized accounts for customers, failed to close them when asked, and applied phony fees that hurt customers' credit. The bank says the issues stem from a few bad eggs, who have been disciplined or fired. But \"on the rare occasions when Wells Fargo did take action against its employees for unethical sales conduct, Wells Fargo further victimized its customers by failing to inform them of the breaches, refund fees they were owed, or otherwise remedy the injuries that Wells Fargo and its bankers have caused,\" the suit alleges, per the Los Angeles Times. The suit also claims bank employees robbed customer accounts of money that was used to pay fees on accounts they never wanted, while the bank placed customers in collections and added \"derogatory information\" to credit reports, Courthouse News reports. The lawsuit follows a 2013 Times investigation which described Wells Fargo employees forging customers' signatures to open unwanted accounts. In new interviews, a former employee says false accounts were opened \"daily,\" while a customer describes \"a three-year battle\" with the bank after his three accounts multiplied to 10. Per the suit: \"Wells Fargo has generated a virtual fee-generating machine, through which its customers are harmed, its employees take the blame, and Wells Fargo reaps the profit.\" LA hopes to put an end to the practices, with up to a $2,500 fine for each violation, plus refunds for customers."

Though the former tennis champ claims his April appointment as a Central African Republic attache to the European Union means he's immune from bankruptcy hearings in the UK, the CAR appears to be balking. Becker's claimed post of attache for sports, culture, and humanitarian affairs \"does not exist\" in CAR records, meaning he's not an official diplomat, says Foreign Ministry chief of staff Cherubin Moroubama. What's more, the diplomatic passport issued to Becker in March, listing his post as \"financial charge de mission,\" is phony, with a serial number matching one of several stolen under a transitional government in 2014, Moroubama says, per the BBC and Guardian. CAR Foreign Minister Charles Armel Doubane calls the passport a \"clumsy fake,\" per ABC Australia. \"To be recognized as a diplomat, it would require not just [the] president's nomination but also my signature as foreign minister,\" he adds, per the Guardian. That leaves plenty of questions for CAR's ambassador to the EU, Daniel Emery Dede, who reportedly signed Becker's passport, and for the CAR embassy in Belgium, which confirmed the issuance of it and featured a photo of Becker on its website, per the BBC. Becker, who met with CAR President Faustin-Archange Touadera in Brussels in April, is maintaining his diplomatic status amid the confusion, reports Deutsche Welle, which has a certificate a lawyer says confirms Becker's position as attache for finance, as well as for sports, culture, and humanitarian affairs."

In a video that's gone viral, the 21-year-old model can be seen staring into a lens for four minutes at a time, Mashable reports. The video was posted to Instagram Wednesday, and it's since been viewed more than 6 million times. Hadid says in the caption that she was \"super excited\" to take part in the staring contest, which was filmed in New York City. \"People should be putting this on their giant TVs during holiday parties instead of fireplace b-roll,\" says an executive producer in a statement picked up by Glamour, which calls the video \"weirdly mesmerizing.\" But not everyone is a fan. \"Let me stop you right there: There's not. It is just Gigi, looking straight ahead, sometimes blinking and smiling, for a full four minutes,\" writes Sam Barsanti at Gizmodo. \"It's just Gigi. She blinks a bunch, so she\u2019s not going to win any staring contests.\" The video is \"a good representation of how clueless many magazines are about how to produce good videos for the web and how equally baffled they are by nontraditional stars like Hadid, who, though a model, has become stratospherically famous for 'doing nothing,' and therefore need not\u2014and perhaps cannot\u2014entertain audiences with more conventional talents.\"",

Staring, and occasionally blinking, in slow motion. For four minutes and nine seconds. And that's it (though she does laugh near the end, prompting one person to comment on YouTube, \"3:53 melted my heart and make my eyes wet?\"). At Slate, Heather Schwedel looks at where this fits in to the buzzy \"pivot to video\" that's underway in the media world, with more and more publications dumping journalists and shifting their resources to producing video. Her conclusion: \"This is how backward our world is, now: A video of a Hadid doing nothing makes a weird sort of sense. Of course! Brilliant!\" Schwedel speculates that this started out as an inside joke born from photo-shoot footage, but writes, \"It\u2019s just as fun to imagine that the editors at Glamour were so devoid of ideas that they asked Hadid to sit there and do nothing for a while on camera.\" And she sees the whole thing as reflective of \"how clueless many magazines are about how to produce good videos for the web.\" But, she concedes, maybe this is a \"step up,\" at least compared with the \"glorified slideshows\" that have become a popular approach to creating cheap videos. At Man Repeller, Amelia Diamond writes that she did get sucked in by the video, but the credit may not go to Hadid. \"Could you have watched anyone for this long with the right song?

Two sisters, Denise and Micheline L\u00e9vy, aged 10 and 9, clutched dolls\u2014one pink, one blue\u2014as they were led away to Auschwitz. A gendarme grabbed the dolls and flung them to the ground, Le Parisien reports, via the Telegraph. A shopkeeper picked them up and gave them to the grandmother of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Gilles, a 38-year-old schoolteacher, who has now donated them to the Shoah Memorial, the Holocaust museum in Paris. The dolls were among 200 items put on display Sunday, out of 19,000 objects collected by volunteers. In many cases like the L\u00e9vy sisters, they are all that remain of the deported. For two generations, Gilles' family minded the dolls. \"But nobody ever played with them,\" she told the paper. \"We knew their history.\" They tried to find out what happened to the L\u00e9vy sisters, but turned up no clues. Gilles said it seemed wrong to keep the dolls. \"We wanted to give them to a museum, or a place of memorial.\" It was difficult to let them go, she added, \"but it was the best thing we could do for the memory of those little girls.\" Over the past two years, volunteers for the Shoah Memorial criss-crossed France collecting a trove of objects belonging to those deported, including photos, a jersey emblazoned with a Star of David, a violin case, and fading slips of paper noting the Jews in hiding stacked in a little red box, reports Telerama. \"Some preferred that we borrow the objects \u2026 so they could pass them on to their children,\" Shoah curator Lior Lalieu-Smadja told Telerama. \"We understand their choice but, unfortunately, we know that quite often this evidence will be lost.\""

Instead, the Android device was given to him in a trade for a new number that is only known to a \"limited number of people,\" the New York Times reports.

Barack Obama, the first president to use a mobile device in office, started with a \"heavily modified\" Blackberry before moving to a mostly disabled iPhone. The devices were used to check email and news sites but rarely\u2014if ever\u2014for phone calls. This is all likely to cramp Trump's style. A Republican senator says the president was known for answering his phone even if he didn't recognize the number. He would even call back strange numbers that didn't leave a message. A former Secret Service agent tells Cnet Trump is unlikely to be able to use his new device for phone calls because they are way too easy to intercept. Trump's aides\u2014some of whom are excited journalists and others won't have direct access to him\u2014say he's likely to instead go office to office in person to get his \"gossip\" fix.

Abath, a rock musician at the time who now lives in Vermont, has claimed he had no part in the robbery, but this new footage appears to contradict a number of his statements.

According to NBC News, there were five polling places in Maricopa County that remained open past midnight, including one location where the final ballot was cast nearly 1am. The Recorder's Office released a letter from the Justice Department Monday asking for information on how many polling places were needed, how many minority voters were affected, and whether potential effects on minorities were examined. \"Obviously, the outcome of the election for the primary is not going to be changed, but delegate counts could be changed,\" an election attorney who was in Florida during the 2000 presidential fiasco tells the Republic. \"The Arizona election is pretty close to as bad as that one.\" Secretary of State Michele Reagan certified the official canvass Monday and says anyone who wants to sue over the results now has five days to file a court challenge, the AP reports.",

The DoJ's civil rights division penned a letter Friday asking Maricopa County, the state's most populous, to determine if federal law was violated regarding, among other things, the number and location of polling sites (the county cut them from 200 to 60 in 2012 in an apparent bid to save money). The Justice Department's reason for this request: reports of \"disproportional burden in waiting times \u2026 in some areas with substantial racial or language minority populations,\" the letter noted. Those waiting times were incredibly inconvenient: The AP notes that some voters waited nearly six hours, with the last vote cast at almost 1am at one site; polls had closed at 7pm, but voters already in line at that point were allowed to cast ballots. Poll workers even reportedly brought pizza to hungry voters. Maricopa County has until April 22 to respond to the DoJ's letter, which included 10 specific requests for information, including polling locations, procedures, and response to public backlash, the Arizona Republic reports. \"We are going to gather the information \u2026 and we will make it public,\" the county elections director says. Despite these issues, Arizona's secretary of state certified the primary results on Monday, calling it for Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, per the AP.

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 The US-led airstrikes in Syria have been a \"major reversal\" for President Obama, writes the editors at the Los Angeles Times. \"Until recently he has assiduously resisted American entanglement in Syria's civil war, and for good reason,\" they write. \"But if the threat posed by Islamic State justifies a rethinking of Obama's aversion tointervention in Syria, might it not also incline him to change his view about 'no boots on the ground?'\" The conflict pits President Bashar al-Assad, a secular dictator with innocent blood on his hands, against an assortment of opponents whose division into moderate and extremist factions isn't nearly so neat or stable as some advocates of US intervention suppose. Obama changed his mind about intervention in Syria for the same reason he decided to launch airstrikes in Iraq and augment the US military presence in that country: a sickeningly swift sequence of events in which Islamic State fighters routed Iraqi forces, terrorized Christians, and other minorities, and seemed poised to attack Baghdad. The result was his promise of a long-term campaign to 'degrade and ultimately destroy' Islamic State.\" But there's much more to be done, writes David Ignatius in the Times: \"President Obama says this will be a long campaign, and it will need to be given the limitations he has put on the military.\" In the New York Times, Ross Douthat agrees that it's a \"welcome offensive,\" but wonders whether the US has \"a clear strategy and achievable aims\" in place.",

Can we trust that he won't reverse himself on ground troops, too? Yes, ISIS and the Khorasan group pose threats to US interests, \"but is the threat serious enough to justify an ever-escalating role for the US military in Syria and Iraq?\" asks the editorial. \"Does the US have a clear strategy and achievable aims? The case has yet to be made.\" Disagree: The Wall Street Journal editorial board not only applauds the airstrikes but thinks US ground troops should be ready to move quickly. If the mission is to succeed, and it must, they'll be needed to direct airstrikes as militants hide in populated areas. \"No US President should ever start a war he doesn't intend to win, and wars rarely go as smoothly as advertised in advance,\" concludes the editorial. \"Now that he has attacked ISIS, Mr. Obama must show that America is the strong horse.\""

He adds \"we don't know if it is going to be a significant cause of human hepatitis,\" but scientists say it's unlikely. In fact, \"it may be good for you.\" They first found the virus in blood samples from two volunteers, part of a study of 46, who received blood transfusions to treat hemophilia between 1974 and 1980. The virus only appeared after transfusions, but both patients cleared it and showed no sign of disease. Two more cases were found among 106 who'd received plasma, per mBio; both cleared the virus, though one was infected for five years. Even if the virus is harmful, researchers say there's no need to panic. \"This is not SARS. This is not MERS. This is not HIV,\" says an expert. Whereas blood transfusions were once performed solely with human blood products, they now use genetically engineered products. Plus, blood is screened more carefully and stricter policies better control who donates blood compared to 25 years ago. \"Does it cause trouble that would justify any response with blood safety? I don\u2019t think we're at that level,\" a pathologist at the Blood Systems Research Institute tells Science. Scientists have yet to isolate the virus but say the next step is to develop an antibody test to find HHpgV-1 in a larger population. Afterward, experts can determine whether those with HHpgV-1 antibodies appear less healthy than those without the virus and look for links to disease.

It had no navigational devices and had lost a rotor blade. Some aboard had been \"reduced to bones,\" and Kyodo News reports that the coast guard suspects it originated in North Korea, which sits about 450 miles away. Sky News reports foreign ships aren't an uncommon occurrence in Japan: 44 have washed ashore this year; 66 did so in 2016. The BBC presents a theory as to why: Some believe North Korea has been calling for more seafood to be fished in order to feed a hungry population. The increased demand may be leading its citizens to take boats that are in subpar condition far off its shores. And as a professor with Japan's Tokai University tells Sky News, the Sea of Japan \"starts to get choppy when November comes. It gets dangerous when northwesterly winds start to blow.\" Kyodo notes the boat that carried the eight live men has vanished; police are reviewing both cases. (This ghost ship was found gutted by fire.)"

But as scientists identified more faults in California, \"it has become increasingly apparent that we are not dealing with a few well-separate faults, but with a vast interconnected fault system.

Another list, spotted by Tech Insider, includes more than 80 names, though the site notes that Anonymous has wrongly identified extremists before. The group is also working to take down ISIS-affiliated websites using denial-of-service attacks to overload servers. ISIS, however, seems unperturbed. \"All they can do is hacking (sic) Twitter accounts, emails etc.,\" the terrorist group said in a statement Monday, calling Anonymous a bunch of \"idiots.\" Still, ISIS shared tips with supporters about how to avoid cyberattacks, including altering email addresses, changing a computer's shared location, and ignoring suspicious links, per Newsweek. While Anonymous' attacks could hinder communications between ISIS supporters, analysts tell the Christian Science Monitor that they're unlikely to do much good. \"What they are doing is more of simple harassment,\" one says. \"In the end it is not going to help law enforcement to prevent an actual physical attack like what happened in Paris.\" (ISIS has a 24-hour help desk for jihadis having tech trouble.)"

Betty McCollum, a member of the Chippewa tribe. \"Here in Minnesota, we have 11 proud tribal nations, but only 150 years ago, their ancestors, men and women, elders and children, were hunted and murdered for profit. This was a government-funded policy of genocide. The pain of this brutal and shameful history is still with us.\" More than two dozen speakers from across the country addressed the noisy but peaceful gathering, which organizers said was the largest-ever protest of the name. Native Americans, students, and other activists chanted, sang, and waved banners: \"Change the Name Now\" and \"Stop Racism in the NFL.\" The interactions between protesters and Redskins fans never turned violent, but they were often tense and sometimes profane. Samuel Wounded Knee, 35, a Crow Creek Sioux with square shoulders and long dark hair, carried a sign that read \"Wake Up Snyder\" and confronted nearly every Redskins fan he saw, cursing at one who cut through the rally and taunted protesters. The protests came as the Vikings opened their season against the Redskins. \"So I'm racist because I like the Redskins?\" one fan told protesters. \"I mean, how far do you go with this?\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The Washington Redskins are having a rough time of it today: Things started with a crash this morning involving two of the team's buses, which were en route to play the Vikings in Minneapolis, reports the AP. A police escort in Minnesota crashed into a guardrail around 8:30am; the team bus immediately behind it braked to avoid hitting the cop car, but second bus rear-ended the first. No injuries. Arriving in Minneapolis, the team was met with chants of \"Who are we? Not your mascot!\" from some 3,200 protesting Native Americans who were none too happy with the \"Redskins\" moniker. \"My Hubby Did Not Fight in Iraq To Be Called A 'Redskin,' read one sign. The protest raised familiar arguments, with one Redskins fan calling the name a \"respectful\" one in which Native Americans should \"take pride.\" The name is nothing more than \"a racial slur,\" counters one Democratic rep at the protest, citing Minnesota's \"11 proud tribal nations. This was a government-funded policy of genocide.\" Indeed, as the Washington Post reports, Minneapolis is home to a sizable Native American presence, perhaps contributing to the size of the demonstration. The issue is compounded by the University of Minnesota, which currently leases its football stadium to the Vikings for a hefty $300,000 per game. With 1,100 students who identify as Native American, the university had in August demanded that the Redskins limit use of the mascot, logo, and team name during today's game."

But the path there officially kicks off Tuesday with a special election primary in which three candidates will be weeded down to two. President Trump and Mitch McConnell are backing former Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange, who was temporarily appointed to the seat after Sessions left it. But it's former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore who's the apparent front-runner, with Strange and US Rep. Mo Brooks trailing behind, reports Politico. More: A candidate needs 50% of the vote to take the seat, which most news outlets agree is unlikely to happen. Moore leads in some polls at around 35% support, with Strange and Brooks in a close race for second. Should Trump's favorite be eliminated, it \"will call into question the influence of Trump's support in a reliably Republican state,\" per Politico. Not that Trump should be too disappointed with Brooks or Moore. Both are \"Trumpian candidates,\" reports Axios. McConnell has a huge interest in the race, though. He and his allies have invested millions in Strange's campaign. Also key: Brooks has said he wants McConnell \"fired.\" Not helping Brooks, however, is a controversial campaign ad he aired that included audio from the shooting of Steve Scalise, reports NBC News. Strange is likewise plagued by his appointment by former Gov. Robert Bentley in what some suspect was \"a corrupt bargain to end the state's criminal investigation of Bentley,\" the New Republic previously reported. Reuters mentions the candidates' stances on issues like gay marriage and illegal immigration. The winner of the runoff election is likely to face one of two Democrats in December: either former US Attorney Doug Jones, backed by Joe Biden, or Robert Kennedy Jr., a Navy veteran with no relation to the famous Kennedy family, per Politico. Either way, the Republican winner will be sitting pretty. Alabama hasn't elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1992, per the New York Times. Polls close at 8pm EDT."

Just 2.5 hectares of land remained above high tide, reports Newsweek. \"Significantly, this probably represents the first recorded mammalian extinction due to anthropogenic climate change,\" the researchers say\u2014though they hope the animals reached the island on debris from Papua New Guinea and still survive there. Researchers say extreme weather was a factor in the extinction of the Little Swan Island hutia, a rodent once found on an atoll off Honduras, but cats were also to blame. \"If this is one of the first\" extinctions solely linked to humans, \"it is more than likely not going to be the last,\" says an ecologist. \"Species restricted to small, low lying islands, or those with very tight environmental requirements are likely to be the first to go.\" (Five islands have already vanished.)"

FBI agents working on the latter investigation carried out a raid on Cohen's home and office in early April, and because part of that mission was to seek documents related to Daniels' nondisclosure agreement, there may be \"large potential factual overlap\" with Daniels' civil case, per Otero. \"This is no simple criminal investigation,\" Otero noted Friday. \"Whether or not an indictment is forthcoming, and the Court thinks it likely based on these facts alone, these unique circumstances counsel in favor of stay.\" Daniels' lawyer, Michael Avenatti, responded to Otero's ruling on Twitter, tweeting: \"While we certainly respect Judge Otero's 90 day stay order based on Mr. Cohen's pleading of the 5th, we do not agree with it.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Two prisoners were beheaded and at least another one died after being thrown off the roof in a riot that erupted yesterday in a prison in southern Brazil, authorities say. Inmates of the penitentiary in the city of Cascavel took at least two agents and several other inmates hostage in the uprising, said military police Capt. Ricardo Pinto, who added that negotiations for better conditions in the prison were still under way last night. The BBC and AFP say the riot was still ongoing this morning, and that a fourth prisoner had been killed after also being pushed from the roof. The revolt began before sunrise yesterday when a prison guard was captured during breakfast. Prisoners set some objects on fire and were using metal poles to cause damage to the 928-bed prison that housed more than 1,000 inmates. Dozens of the prisoners climbed onto the building's rooftop, with their faces covered with white fabric. Local media images showed at least 30 rebellious inmates shouting while they beat men held with ropes around their necks, or whose hands were tied behind them. The rioting inmates waved banners emblazoned with the initials PCC for a criminal prison gang formed in the 1990s. Jairo Ferreira, a lawyer for the prison guards' union, said the prisoners rioted to demand better food and medical care."

In a study published in Science, researchers from Australia's Australian National University say Dickinsonia lived on Earth 558 million years ago\u2014millions of years earlier than they previously thought\u2014and they have found molecules of fat in an ancient fossil that proves it. \"The fossil fat molecules that we've found prove that animals were large and abundant 558 millions years ago,\" says lead researcher Associate Professor Jochen Brocks. \"Scientists have been fighting for more than 75 years over what Dickinsonia and other bizarre fossils of the Edicaran Biota were: giant single-celled amoeba, lichen, failed experiments of evolution, or the earliest animals on Earth,\" he says in a press release. The team found Dickinsonia fossils with organic matter still intact in rocks in a remote part of Russia, where they \"had to hang over the edge of a cliff on ropes and dig out huge blocks of sandstone, throw them down, wash the sandstone, and repeat this process until I found the fossils I was after,\" researcher Ilya Bobrovskiy tells the Washington Post. \"I took a helicopter to reach the sandstone.\" The team believes Dickinsonia produced cholesterol, which is unique in ancient life because all organics break down, leaving only the \"original skeleton of the cholesterol\" preserved in molecular fossils. Researchers believe the cholesterol is responsible for the hair's color and for its ability to grow long, Newsweek. \"What you get is an average composition of the ecosystem that was found in Siberia.",

That conclusion comes thanks to fat, reports Phys.org. Ilya Bobrovskiy of Australian National University discovered a Dickinsonia fossil in 300-foot-high cliffs along the White Sea in northwest Russia, in a place so remote she reached it via helicopter. The fossil was superbly preserved, so much so that its tissue had cholesterol molecules present in it. \"The fossil fat molecules that we've found prove that animals were large and abundant 558 million years ago, millions of years earlier than previously thought,\" says ANU professor Jochen Brocks, co-author of the paper on the discovery, which was published in Science.

Officials say the stolen helicopter fired 15 shots at the Interior Ministry before launching four grenades at the Supreme Court building, Reuters reports. There were no reports of deaths or injuries. In a statement posted online, the police officer believed to have piloted the helicopter, flanked by armed men, said he was part of \"a coalition of military employees, policemen, and civilians who are looking for balance and are against this criminal government,\" the BBC reports. The officer, who identified himself as police pilot Oscar Perez, called for new elections to be held and said the coalition was fighting \"tyranny,\" not security forces. Maduro, whose government has been targeted by violent protests that have left at least 75 people dead over the last three months, said the attack could have \"caused a tragedy with several dozen dead and injured,\" the AP reports. He said the armed forces had been placed on alert. \"I have activated the entire armed forces to defend the peace,\" Maduro said. \"Sooner or later, we are going to capture that helicopter and those who carried out this terror attack.\""

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 North Korea defied international warnings and launched a ballistic missile over Japan on Tuesday\u2014the same day the UN Security Council unanimously approved new sanctions against the country, CNN reports. \"The world has received North Korea's latest message loud and clear: this regime has signaled its contempt for its neighbors, for all members of the United Nations, and for minimum standards of acceptable international behavior,\" President Trump said in a statement. Trump said the US is seeking an emergency meeting of the Security Council. \"All options are on the table,\" he said. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the \"reckless behavior\" of North Korea is a \"direct threat\" to the US and its allies. South Korean President Moon Jae-in also condemned the launch, calling it a \"grave provocation.\" The intermediate-range missile flew over Japan before splashing into the Pacific Ocean. Experts say the launch appears to have been a calculated move designed to draw Japan and the US closer together. The North Korean state news agency said that Kim Jong Un was present for the missile launch and that it was a \"meaningful prelude to containing Guam,\" the New York Times reports. Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said he spoke to Trump for 40 minutes on the issue and that the two\u2014\"Currently, a North Korean missile is flying above Japan,\" the Japanese government says in a text message. \"It is very dangerous.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 \"Are we really willing to risk Los Angeles or Chicago in retaliation for an attack on a US military base in the region? Probably not,\" nuclear strategy specialist Vipin Narang tells the AP. And that's exactly the calculation that gives North Korea a small shot at \"winning\" in a nuclear conflict, challenging the assumption that launching a nuclear weapon would be automatic suicide for the country. If North Korea feels threatened to the point of using a nuclear weapon, a first target would likely be a US military base in Japan; North Korea would then use its long-range nukes to threaten the US mainland and avoid a retaliatory strike. Experts say this is Kim Jong Un's \"theory of victory\"\u2014one that President Trump may be attempting to combat with an unsuccessful version of the \"madman strategy.\" Here's what else you need to know about North Korea's most-recent missile launch: Tuesday's missile launch over Japan seems likely to result in even more sanctions against North Korea. But after UN sanctions Aug. 5 targeted millions of dollars in seafood, coal, iron ore, and more, is there anything left to sanction? CNN reports two options are oil and Chinese banks. After Tuesday's missile launch, Trump said \"all options are on the table.\" This was, all things considered, a \"measured\" response from the president, according to the Atlantic. It was an official statement instead of a tweet, didn't threaten \"fire and fury,\" and avoided calling Kim Jong Un a \"wack job.\" The Guardian reports on the scary morning had by residents of Japan, who were awoken around 6am Tuesday by a government missile warning on their phones. They were given less than 10 minutes to get to a shelter or sturdy building as sirens and special broadcasts blared. The missile test impacted US markets, with the Dow dropping more than 100 points Tuesday morning, Reuters reports. The stock market would recover by the afternoon as the threat passed. Korea expert Stephan Haggard tells the Washington Post that Tuesday was another example of how \"weirdly conservative\" Kim Jong Un is\u2014carrying out provocative actions with just enough restraint to avoid an actual response. For example, pointing the missile toward Japan, not Guam. Finally, Russia's deputy foreign minister blamed the US and South Korea for Tuesday's nuclear test and came out against further sanctions against North Korea, saying they haven't prevented missile tests in the past and won't in the future, Newsweek reports."

Groening, 93, says he was assigned to the Auschwitz I section of the complex, where gas chambers and crematoria were located, but he also worked at Birkenau, where the main gas chambers were located. \"Someone said that 5,000 people were processed in 24 hours, but I didn't verify this,\" he said, per the AP, adding that he \"didn't know\" how many were actually processed.

Groening earlier described a veritable traffic jam of trains arriving at the Nazi death camp, reports the BBC. \"For the sake of order we waited until train one was entirely processed and finished,\" Groening testified; that processing involved marching most passengers directly into the gas chambers.

In other developments: Timothy Vail was the last man to escape from a New York prison, according to the New York Daily News, and he says he hopes Matt and Sweat can avoid capture. He tells the Daily News that he hopes they \"stay out of sight and don't commit any new crimes.\" Vail, who raped and murdered a pregnant woman in 1988, injured himself while escaping from the Elmira Correctional Facility in 2003 and was recaptured within two days after he and a fellow fugitive stole a van. Police officers who've dealt with Matt say he is the most evil criminal they've encountered, and he was trouble from a very early age, the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle reports. The former chief of police in North Tonawanda, near where Matt grew up, says he's around the same age as the 48-year-old and that long before Matt's first arrest, he had a \"fearsome\" reputation and was known for terrorizing other kids on the school bus. An officer in Tonawanda tells the paper that in 1986\u201411 years before his arrest for a gruesome local murder\u2014Matt broke out of a correctional facility and was recaptured a few days later.

A history professor tells the Times that the first escapes happened just weeks after the prison opened.

According to a police report seen by the Dallas Morning News, Colleen Crowley told officers that Manziel hit her several times during an argument. Crowley said Manziel, who was not arrested, told her he was going to drive her home because he didn't want her to drive while intoxicated. She said he also appeared to be \"on some kind of drugs.\" The police report states that Crowley was \"somewhat vague on the details of the assault\" and became \"increasingly uncooperative\" during the investigation. Crowley told police that she did not report the assault at her apartment because she was \"running in and out of her apartment through the front door in an attempt to get away from Jonathan.\" She told officers she \"finally rushed out of the apartment and ran to a nearby neighbor's door to seek help.\" Fort Worth police said in a statement Thursday that they had completed an \"information only\" report on the incident and that \"Investigative efforts to date have not resulted in the filing of a criminal complaint and the incident is determined to be closed.\"",

Crowley told police Manziel \"restrained\" her then \"led\" her down a back stairway to the valet after she tried to leave. \"I was crying and begged the valet, 'Please don't let him take me. I'm scared for my life!'\" she reportedly told police. She said the valet responded: \"I don't know what to do.\" USA Today reports Manziel told her she was too buzzed to drive, so he would take her home.

Crowley claimed Manziel then threatened to kill himself, later adding, \"Shut up or I'll kill us both.\" The altercation ended at Crowley's Fort Worth apartment where she says she grabbed a knife and Manziel fled, sources say. A police report notes Crowley became \"increasingly uncooperative\" during an investigation, and no charges were filed. Manziel tells TMZ that he didn't hit Crowley or threaten suicide. \"It didn't happen,\" he says. \"I'm completely stable.\""

Researchers at the University of Southern California looked at the health records of more than 50,000 pregnant women and found that women who ate five or more servings of potatoes a week had a 26% higher risk of developing the disease, which can lead to diabetes, high blood pressure, and other health problems, the New York Times reports. \"Our findings are biologically plausible, though the detailed underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated,\" the study's lead author says in a press release. \"High potato consumption can result.\" The researchers also found that pregnant women who consumed five servings of baked, boiled, mashed, or French fries a week were 24% less likely to develop gestational diabetes mellitus, the most common type of diabetes during pregnancy, the Los Angeles Times notes.

So suggests a National Institutes of Health study published Tuesday in the BMJ that found women who eat more potatoes before becoming pregnant may be more likely to develop gestational diabetes as compared to their spud-light counterparts. That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap. The researchers estimate that trading two servings of potatoes weekly for a substitute vegetable, legumes, or whole-grain food would reduce the risk of gestational diabetes\u2014which CBS reports affects as many as 8% of pregnancies\u2014by 9% to 12%. As for why women should care, Zhang tells the BBC that women with gestational diabetes can develop pre-eclampsia and hypertension, which \"can adversely affect the fetus\" and put the mother at higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. The team notes, however, that the study shows correlation, not causation, and says more research is needed. (One country has told its women not to get pregnant right now.)"

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Humans were thought to be unique as a species in that we use both halves of our brains to \"distinguish different aspects of sound,\" as Georgetown neuroscientist Stuart Washington puts it. Turns out we're not as special as we thought. A type of bat also displays this hemispheric specialization when it comes to sound processing, Washington has discovered. In both humans and Parnell's mustached bats\u2014a species that lives in an area ranging from Mexico to Brazil, RedOrbit reports\u2014the left hemisphere handles quicker sounds, while the right deals with slower ones, a press release reports. For humans, the right hemisphere \"may allow us to identify who is speaking, to gauge their emotional state via tone of voice, and to tease out pitch in music,\" Washington notes. As for the left hemisphere, \"men largely use just the left hemisphere\" to process language, while women use both hemispheres to do so, Washington says. In mustached bats\u2014named based on the hair springing from the sides of their snouts, Animal Diversity Web explains\u2014the right hemisphere's slower processing is used for sonar, \"which relies on detecting small changes in frequency,\" says Washington, senior author of the study in Frontiers in Neuroscience. The left is used \"to distinguish communication sounds from each other, because (the bats') communication sounds have rapid changes in frequency.\" All this is more than just a matter of interest: The findings could help study human language disorders, especially since some study techniques \"can only be permitted in animals,\" Washington adds.

That was him finally owning it,\" Lake tells People, adding she now feels compelled \"to spread the word about recognizing this disorder and getting treatment as soon as possible.\" Though she describes Evans as \"charismatic\" and \"funny,\" she says he also had \"a lot of self-esteem issues and a lot of demons.\" It was difficult \"for him to get out of bed and be excited for things,\" says Lake, who initially revealed his death on Instagram, per Us Weekly. But in 2014, he suffered a manic episode. \"I didn't know what it looked like, so I didn't see it coming,\" Lake says. He \"thought he could fly. He thought he could cure cancer with his hands. It was horrific.\" Lake later divorced Evans, who entered a treatment center, but says the couple remained together until a similar episode last September. \"I wanted to save him,\" but \"there was nothing I could do,\" Lake says. \"The struggle was just too much for him,\" she adds of his suicide. \"He did the best he could.\""

It took about 30 minutes to do. Even though I was knackered half way across I knew I had to get to the other side.\" He reportedly told the Sun that he was about 160 feet from the dam and felt a strong tug. \"I was sucked towards the wall and had to swim hard.\" He says police were waiting for him and handcuffed him for what he didn't realize wasn't permitted, as he says there aren't any \"no swimming\" signs posted. \"You're just expected not to.\" He says he ended up getting fined about $330, but, as the tattoo on his body reads, per the Times of London: \"No regrets.\" (This bachelor party ended up being a scam.)"

Many of the people who have racked up nearly 3 million views of the video that shows Detective Jeff Payne arresting University of Utah Hospital nurse Alex Wubbels would likely agree. Gill on Friday called for a criminal investigation into the encounter, in which Payne handcuffed a screaming Wubbels after she refused to permit a blood draw from an unconscious patient\u2014as she was right to do, according to law, because Payne had neither a warrant nor the consent of the patient, who was not under arrest. The Salt Lake Tribune reports Payne was put on administrative leave Friday afternoon, along with a second unnamed officer connected to the July 26 incident. More: Mayor Jackie Biskupski and Chief Mike Brown both called Wubbels to apologize. Per the city, the Unified Police Department will begin a criminal probe into the matter, and an internal affairs investigation will be conduced as well. The Tribune also offers more background on the patient in question: William Gray, a 43-year-old who was driving a semi when a 26-year-old who was trying to evade the Utah Highway Patrol crashed into Gray head-on. That driver was killed, and a police official explains it's typical to get blood draws of those involved in fatal crashes, even if they aren't suspected of wrongdoing. The AP cites Payne's police report, in which he wrote he was trying to avoid a \"scene\" by taking Wubbels outside and that this his boss told him to arrest her if she didn't cooperate with the draw. Wubbels' attorney says the nurse was left in a hot police car for 20 minutes before the detective realized the hospital had already drawn the patient's blood as part of treatment. The Tribune notes that while the video may suggest Payne was demanding Wubbels draw Gray's blood, Payne is actually one of a handful of officers certified to draw blood in accident cases, and was looking to draw the blood himself."

If we don't act now, we will be leaving behind a trail of dead animals and plants that will be unrecognizable to future generations.\" So says George Takei, a co-author of a study published Friday in Science Advances that found the rate of extinction for species in the 20th century was up to 114 times higher than it would have been without man's impact. \"This is very depressing because we used the most conservative rates, and even then they are much higher than the normal extinction rate, really indicating we are having a massive loss of the species,\" Dr. Gerardo Ceballos of the National Autonomous University of Mexico tells the Guardian. vertebrates\u2014including mammals, birds, and fish\u2014 comprise more than half of all species on the planet and have suffered a 52% decline over the past 40 years. The normal rate is two species dying out every 10,000 years; the current rate is 114 times that. Humans are largely to blame for the extinctions of at least 77 mammals, 140 types of bird, amphibians, and 34 since 1500, including the dodo. \"The evidence is incontrovertible that recent extinction rates are unprecedented in human history and highly unusual in Earth's history,\" the study's lead author says in a press release. \"If the currently elevated extinction pace is allowed to continue, humans will soon.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Feeling upbeat? Enough of that: Planet Earth is undergoing a sixth mass extinction that will likely annihilate the human race unless we can curb the trend, scientists say. According to a new paper, the current rate of species extinction outpaces the natural rate far more than anyone knew, NBC News reports. The analysis \"employed better knowledge\" of Earth's natural extinction rate, the Guardian reports, upping the number from one extinction per million species annually to two extinctions. It then compared that to a current extinction rate that study authors consider conservative. Presto, they got a rate since 1900 that's eight to 100 times worse than the natural one. \"We were very surprised to see how bad it is,\" says study leader Gerardo Ceballos. \"This is very depressing.\" \"If it is allowed to continue, life would take millions of years to recover, and our species itself would disappear early on,\" says Ceballos. But nations can reverse the crisis\u2014which has been linked to deforestation, industrialization, and other human factors\u2014by conserving threatened species and lowering pressures on their populations, the paper says. So far critics seem to buy the paper's basic math but doubt that species extinction will continue at this high rate for centuries. \"It is likely the problem will decline rapidly because most countries will be rich and care much for the natural world,\" writes one environmentalist. Earth has seen five other mass extinctions, including one 443 million years ago that killed off 83% of sea life, and the most recent, which wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago, the Telegraph notes."

Here's a look at some of the key points: The bill cuts the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%. It also temporarily lowers the individual tax rate for everyone but the wealthiest Americans. It boosts the national debt by about $5 trillion over the next decade. The vote was 52-48 along party lines, with Maine's Sen. Susan Collins the last Republican to vote in favor, the AP reports.

The record-breaking speech came after 39 opposition lawmakers spoke for 192 hours and 25 minutes over nine days to block the vote on the bill, which would give the nation's intelligence service the authority to collect information on private communications, travel, and financial transactions of potential terrorists. The bill was put to a vote last week, but the opposition used the filibuster to delay it and prevent it from passing.

A total of 49 lawmakers took turns speaking around the clock in opposition to the bills, claiming it would give too much power to the intelligence agency.

At least the lawmakers still have something to show for their efforts: They smashed the world record for filibustering set in 2011 when Canadian lawmakers delayed proceedings for 57 hours. The last speaker alone spoke for 12 hours and 31 minutes to claim the record for longest individual filibuster in South Korea. Speakers wore running shoes, thumbed through huge stacks of documents, read academic articles and online comments on privacy infringement in their entirety, and recited sections of George Orwell's 1984, per Yonhap News. It was unsurprising, then, that the parliament chair was caught sleeping. The lawmakers argued the anti-terror bill\u2014allowing for the collection of data, including phone records, on people considered security risks\u2014would violate privacy rights, but President Park Geun-hye said the filibuster was \"nothing more than a dereliction of duty.\" The public was also peeved that the stunt held up bills regarding North Korean human rights and an upcoming election."

The sources say Neiman acknowledged the breach in a call with credit card companies on Monday, and that the time stamp on the first hack was in mid-July. In a statement yesterday, Neiman said it had \"no knowledge of any connection\" between the two breaches, though it did acknowledge that \"some of our customers' payment cards were used fraudulently after making purchases at our stores.\" The company said it would provide customers with a free year of credit monitoring, similar to what Target has offered.",

The Department of Homeland Security recently sent retailers and financial service companies a secret memo warning that the Target hit appeared to be part of a larger international campaign, the Wall Street Journal reports, an insight gleaned with the help of Dallas cybersecurity firm iSight Partners. Yesterday, iSight released its own report, saying that a virus it's calling KAPTOXA \"has potentially infected a large number of retail information systems\"\u2014and noting that the \"intrusion operators displayed innovation and a high degree of skill,\" particularly in terms of the \"operational sophistication\" of the hack. The Journal shares this feature by way of example: The virus focused on stealing data during the peak hours of 10am and 5pm; the data was housed in a Target server that the hackers later accessed. The virus attacks point-of-sale systems in a way that is \"new to eCrime,\" subverting traditional efforts to protect consumer data, the report warns, according to NBC. Parts of the code, which is impervious to all known antivirus software, have been online since last spring.
