The Sunday report by several newspapers says an advanced vertical take-off and landing or VTOL drone will be displayed in February. Resalat quoted Abbas Jam, who is director of the project, as saying that the drone can also fly in silence. Iran says other drones made dozens of apparently undetected flights into Israeli airspace from Lebanon in recent years. The report follows Iran's claim earlier this month that it obtained images of sensitive Israeli bases taken by a drone that was launched by Lebanon's Hezbollah movement that month and downed by Israel. Meanwhile, Reuters reports that Iran plans to boost its naval presence in the Persian Gulf to protect three islands it says the United Arab Emirates is illegally occupying. \"The security of the Iranian islands ... is part of the various strategies of the naval force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps,\" says a commander.",

As Reuters reports by way of Iranian state media, a lead researcher claimed that the drone would be tested yesterday and \"unveiled\" next year, adding that the drone \"enjoys ultra-advanced technology and has been built for the first time in the world.\" The drone is reportedly also capable of hovering in mid-air, and is silent, adds the AP. Iran earlier this week claimed it had drones far more advanced than Hezbollah's."

Cynk Technology operates a \"social network\" called Introbiz.com. It has no revenue, no assets, no members, and only one employee. \"Real companies get hurt when the entire space gets tagged as bad because of really bad incidents such as this,\" a former SEC official tells Bloomberg. The move came after the SEC discovered that Cynk, based in Belize, hadn't filed quarterly reports with the SEC as required, nor had it issued any press releases in the past six months. \"We've been very good friends since we were young,\" one employee tells Business Insider. \"He recently got a hold of me and said he has a job for me.

The company, Cynk, runs a website called Introbiz.com designed to help connect people with celebrities and various kinds of professionals. Fair enough\u2014until its stock leaped by 25,000% since June, notes Business Insider. Worse, the company address in Belize City, Belize, is inaccurate (Cynk apologized) and the company's shares have swapped hands three times over six years, always between people who were the CEO and sole employee. More details: Business Insider found someone matching CEO Javier Romero on Facebook and called him up. He answered to Javier until the reporter identified herself, when he said he was really Jason. Javier is \"actually out right now,\" he said. \"I don't really want to disclose his business. I can definitely get a number for you guys.\" Stock manipulation in the penny market is \"extremely common\" and hard to regulate, an expert tells Bloomberg. Another says that \"one percent\" of investors would trade in a company like Cynk\u2014but stock promoters hardly helped, raving on Twitter that the stock \"keeps surging higher!!\" and \"this could be EPIC!!\" The SEC probe is part of its recent crackdown on penny-stock fraud. Over the past two years, the commission has halted trading in over 1,300 companies. The blog Zero Hodge drew attention to the stock this week, quipping, \"Lord Overstone said it best.

House of Cards producer Media Rights Capital says Spacey was reported for sexual harassment in 2012 and it is \"deeply troubled\" by the new allegations, per the Hollywood Reporter.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Donald Trump was pretty pleased with his performance against Hillary Clinton at Monday's debate, even though scientific polls\u2014not the easily manipulated online polls that Trump is citing\u2014show most Americans pick Clinton as the clear victor. Even some of his own campaign advisers don't feel he was on point enough during the head-to-head, though they're framing it as \"missed opportunities\" rather than total failure. And so the strategy for Oct. 9's debate is reportedly getting an overhaul, with more role-playing practice, facts study, and even rehearsing how to move around the stage for the town-hall-style event, per the New York Times. What these advisers, who spoke anonymously to the paper, are worried about, however, is whether Trump will agree to this prep. Complicating things: Some say he actually was drilled on how to combat Clinton on certain issues and that he just chose not to. Others point the finger at Trump's extremely busy schedule in the days before the debate and too many people (up to a dozen, some with not much political acumen) giving him conflicting suggestions. Sources say his debate training was \"unconventional,\" with Trump unable to concentrate during more traditional sessions and preferring to simply dish with advisers rather than have mock debates. Trump himself told Fox News he found it hard to segue into some of those challenges against Clinton on the debate stage, such as the subject of Benghazi. Trump's pulling back\u2014he stopped attacking Clinton and even grew \"subdued\" as the debate proceeded\u2014has got to change the next time around, frustrated aides say. Instead, he has to set Clinton's vulnerabilities in his sights and stick to his plan for the whole night. \"It clearly looked like he ran out of gas after 30 minutes [in the New York debate], and that came through loud and clear,\" a senior political strategist tells the Times."

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 An experimental treatment being tested on animals could dramatically improve the prognosis for people with right heart failure, which is the leading cause of death in Canada and the third leading cause in the US, Medical Daily reports. The treatment targets a protein known as Cardiotrophin 1 that helps the heart's small blood vessels grow and pump blood around the body. Researchers injected it into the hearts of rats and mice and found that the creatures' hearts increased in size and blood flow. \"This suggests the action of CT1 is universally conserved and puts us much closer to therapy,\" says co-author Dr. Patrick Burgon of the University of Ottawa Heart Institute. \"If this testing is successful, it will take a number of years for the treatment to become widely available.\" Right heart failure\u2014which occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs\u2014is the only treatment currently available for the condition. CT-1 helps the muscles to grow in a more healthy way and stimulates blood vessel growth around the heart, improving its ability to pump blood. This process happens naturally during pregnancy and when athletes exercise. After the baby is born or the athlete stops exercising, the heart returns to its original state. \"Treatment with CT-1 might get them to that point,\" the researcher says. So far, about two weeks of treatment with a mini-pump about the size of a tablet inserted under the skin has proven to be beneficial for about two months after treatment stops. The researchers still need to figure out the minimum dose to get the maximum effect.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Scientists in Canada say they've found a way to trick the heart, making it behave as if it were the beneficiary of exercise even if no exercise was able to be done. According to a study in Cell Research, the Ottawa researchers discovered that protein cardiotrophin 1 (CT1) can fuel healthy heart growth, repair heart damage, and cause the heart to pump more blood in cases of left heart failure, as a result of heart attack, and right heart failure, as a result of high blood pressure in the lungs, reports Medical News Today. It's a big deal since medications used to treat left heart failure don't work on right heart failure, which usually requires a heart transplant, per a release. Exercise can be beneficial because it boosts the heart's ability to pump blood, but \"people with heart failure usually can't exercise,\" researcher Lynn Megeney tells the Ottawa Citizen. The heart usually responds by expanding, irreversibly, in an unhealthy way. But that's why CT1 is \"very exciting,\" Megeney says. It \"causes heart muscles to grow in a more healthy way and it also stimulates blood vessel growth in the heart,\" increasing blood flow just like with exercise. And just like with exercise, the heart returns to its original size afterward. Megeney says the discovery could lead to fewer heart transplants, but he says it could be two or three years before researchers begin clinical trials on humans and, assuming they go well, a decade before treatment is available to the public.

The victims' argument centers around the marketing campaign behind the AR-15, which the mother of one 6-year-old victim tells CBS News was \"morally reprehensible.\" The lawsuit claims Remington linked \"the AR-15 to macho vigilantism and military-style insurrection\" in order to target a \"younger demographic\" and increase sales.

Aisthorpe, then 26, came down with the flu, and so he climbed back down on Oct. 16, 1988, to seek medical attention. When Aisthorpe realized he was in no condition to attempt the climb, he sent a message back to Runarsson and Gudjonsson, both 27 and from Iceland: \"Feel free\" to go for the summit without him.

Among other things, the A350 is 20% bigger than its predecessors, 10% wider, 50% carbon fiber-reinforced plastic, and features LED lights that change color to reflect the sun's natural glow. It's also pressurized to 6,000 feet, so passengers have more room to move around. The plane's flaps follow the flight path, which reduces drag and noise and makes the ride smoother. It also features a filter that changes the air every two to three minutes to keep stale air from entering the cabin. The A350's interior is also designed to be adaptable so that carriers can swap out seats and configuration much more easily than in the past. \"There's an open architecture that can evolve to welcome new functions and can cope with the evolution of technology,\" an Airbus engineer tells Popular Mechanics.",

Another factor: Because of the planes' relatively light frames, they can be pressurized to 6,000 feet, which the airline says allows for more humidity and makes the air pressure inside the aircraft closer to the pressure on the ground than is the case with most jets, per Quartz. A third factor is the jet's filtration system, which replaces the air in the cabin in its entirety every two to three minutes. The idea there is that, if nothing else, the improved air quality should help people sleep better on long flights. And the big question: Has it worked? It's a little too early to tell.

The pilot reported the incident, which landed safely, to police after the drone came within 500 feet of the plane as it was coming in to land from Geneva, NBC News reports. Five crew members and 132 passengers were aboard the Airbus A320 at the time. British Airways said in a statement that the plane was inspected and cleared for the next flight. \"Safety and security are always our first priority and we will give the police every assistance with their investigation,\" the airline said. The UK's Air Proximity Board says it has logged more than 100 near-misses involving drones over the past two years, the BBC reports. The board says drones \"just have no place to be\" at the country's airports, with incidents including a drone \"flying over the top of a B737 aircraft while at 4,000 feet, missing it by about 5m, shortly after it left\" Manchester Airport in August, and a drone that came within 50 feet of a plane in September.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 In what the UK's Civil Aviation Authority says would be \"a totally unacceptable\" first, a British Airways plane landing at Heathrow appears to have been hit by a drone on Sunday, the BBC reports. The Airbus A320 coming into London from Geneva had 132 passengers and five crew members aboard, a BA spokesman tells CNN; the incident was reported after the BA pilot touched down. \"Our aircraft landed safely, was fully examined by our engineers and it was cleared to operate its next flight,\" the rep says. No arrests have been made (it's unclear whose drone it may have been), and the aviation security arm of the Metropolitan Police is looking into the matter. Police note that flying a drone too close to a plane is illegal, NBC News reports, with punishment including up to five years in prison. Specifically, drones over 15 pounds can't fly higher than 400 feet and aren't permitted to fly \"beyond the direct unaided line of sight\" of its operator or near crowds or buildings. Not that the incident came as a total surprise: The head of the International Air Transport Association had previously noted the \"real and growing threat\" of a drone-plane hit, while a British Airline Pilots Association rep says it was \"only a matter of time.\" A recent study by Bard College's Center for the Study of the Drone underscores the danger in US airspace, with 327 \"close encounters\" of drones flying within 500 feet of manned aircraft between December 2013 and September 2015, and at least 28 pilots \"[maneuvering] to avoid a collision with a drone.\" Frighteningly, aviation experts say they don't really know what would happen if a drone got sucked into a plane's engine, a Civil Aviation Authority rep tells NBC. (A drone recently came within 200 feet of a plane at LAX.)"

US planes are bringing in supplies and a medical ship is on the way; Britain is also sending an aircraft carrier, notes the BBC. In other developments: Supplies from the US and other countries are arriving, but some areas are still in desperate need of relief and \"the major challenge is logistics,\" a European Commission spokesman tells the LA Times. \"With all this aid arriving and at the same time, the various Philippine authorities\u2014military, civilian structures, the Philippine Red Cross\u2014trying to distribute aid to so many communities ... obviously there are bottlenecks.\" Lawlessness in the devastated city of Tacloban is also slowing the distribution of aid, the Guardian finds. A Red Cross convoy was allegedly hijacked by armed men and there are rumors that inmates who escaped during the storm have been ambushing people carrying supplies. Communist rebels have declared a ceasefire in disaster areas, but troops say there has been at least one attack. Some 2,357 people have been confirmed dead, but the toll is expected to rise significantly as remote areas hit hard by the storm are reached. In Tacloban, where bodies are being trucked to mass graves, the city administrator says he is sticking by his original estimate of 10,000 dead in the city alone. In a smaller city south of Tacloban, the devastation is even worse and a 16-member medical team from California is laboring in extreme conditions to help survivors, NBC finds. The volunteer surgeons\u2014working by flashlight in Tanawan's ruined town hall\u2014believe the region will need help for months. \"I don\u2019t know when or how we are going to be able to leave,\" one doctor says. \"This is just the beginning of a wave of misery.\" USA Today has more on that front: The few doctors in Manila are already overwhelmed with hundreds of patients\u2014and those are mostly minor injuries. They're soon expecting to see big problems like pneumonia, diarrhea, infections, and dehydration. And the New York Times looks at a hospital in Tacloban that has no power, where victims lay waiting for care. Food, water, and medical supplies are short; one patient interviewed by the Times says he has not received painkillers, antibiotics, or even an antiseptic for his wounds."

A new UCLA study suggests a link, though researchers emphasized that more research needs to be done to confirm what's actually happening. Still, the findings \"could raise questions about whether people with acne should take vitamin B12 supplements,\" observes Live Science. It seems that the vitamin changes the way skin bacteria behaves, which promotes inflammation, which in turn leads to pimples. Some people are more vulnerable than others. \"This study does present some compelling evidence suggesting that supplementation with B12 can cause or exacerbate acne in a subset of individuals,\" says a co-author of the study. She emphasizes that the research shows correlation, not causation. While previous studies have linked the vitamin to acne flareups, this is the first to provide details on how it interacts on a molecular level with bacteria, especially Propionibacterium acnes. One upside of the research is that it might eventually lead to better acne medication, reports the Verge. (Kids may be getting too many vitamins in cereal.)"

Since then, the price of the life-saving device\u2014which counteracts severe allergic reactions by injecting a dose of epinephrine into a person's body\u2014has risen by more than 500%, to more than $600 a pair. \"We really noticed it in the past year, year and a half when we went to go have it filled. It was $600,\" says Lexi Henegar, whose 7-year-old daughter has severe allergies to dairy, wheat, soy, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, and sesame seeds. Mylan, the manufacturer of the EpiPen, says the price has changed over time to better reflect important product features and the value the product provides. The company also notes it's made a \"significant investment to support the device over the past years.\" But CBS reports Mylan's main competitor, Teva Pharmaceuticals, recalled its EpiPen last fall after a public outcry over the price. \"The only explanation for Mylan raising the price by six times since 2009 is that the company values profits more than the lives of millions of Americans,\" Bernie Sanders tells NBC News.",

But drugmaker Mylan has hiked the price of the device by nearly 500% over the past few years, CBS News reports, and parents and doctors aren't happy. \"When epinephrine only costs a few cents, but they're going up to $500, personally I don't think that's ethically responsible,\" allergy specialist Dr. Douglas McMahon told NBC News. \u201cPatients are calling and saying they can't afford it.\u201d (McMahon is seeking FDA approval for his own device that he says will cost $50.) Twice in her seven years, Ellie Henegar\u2019s life was saved with an EpiPen, but her parents were stunned last year when the bill came to $600, they told CBS. Compare that to 2009, when the bill was about $100 for the same two-pack of EpiPen. While insurance covers varying degrees of the cost, not everyone is lucky enough to have a plan that does, NBC notes. With a near monopoly, Mylan has little incentive to cut the price, Bloomberg reports. In fact, Mylan execs considered dumping the aging product in 2007. Instead, they launched a marketing campaign that turned the device into an essential, donating EpiPens to schools and dropping $35 million on TV ads. A law passed by Congress in 2013 requiring schools to stock epinephrine devices also boosted sales, which last year totaled $1 billion. Mylan contends it has made a \"significant investment\" to improve the device and offers coupons. \"It's a totally established brand name with little competition,\" Bloomberg\u2019s Robert Langreth tells CBS. \"That gives them freedom to raise the price every year.\""

The group, discovered by two British divers late Monday, are on a dry rock ledge around 2.5 miles from the mouth of the cave, and the Thai military says it could be months before it can get them out, unless the boys learn to dive, the BBC reports. The cave in northern Thailand often remains flooded until the end of the rainy season in September or October, meaning the youth soccer team and their coach may need to have food and other supplies sent in for the next four months. Experts warn that it could be very difficult to get the boys, ages 11 to 16, to safety through miles of dark, narrow, flooded tunnels. \"Trying to take non-divers through a cave is one of the most dangerous situations possible, even if the dives are relatively easy,\" US National Cave Rescue Commission coordinator Anmar Mirza tells the AP. Thai officials say they're committed to \"100% safety\" and will continue to explore their options, including draining water from the cave system and searching for shafts that could provide an alternative escape route. Officials say the boys are hungry and weak but in stable medical condition with only minor injuries. They have been provided with high-protein liquid food and will be given more supplies and visited by doctors in the days to come."

    "document": "Talcum Powder and Cancer \n \n What is talcum powder? \n \n Talcum powder is made from talc, a mineral made up mainly of the elements magnesium, silicon, and oxygen. As a powder, it absorbs moisture well and helps cut down on friction, making it useful for keeping skin dry and helping to prevent rashes. It is widely used in cosmetic products such as baby powder and adult body and facial powders, as well as in a number of other consumer products. \n \n In its natural form, some talc contains asbestos, ...",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Baby powder and other cosmetic products containing talcum powder have been linked to an increased risk of cancer in women, according to a new study. The study, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, looked at data on more than 31,000 women and found that those who used talcum powder for more than a year had a 24% increased chance of getting ovarian cancer, the New York Times reports. Researchers say they're not sure why talc\u2014which is used in products including baby powder and facial powders\u2014is linked to cancer, but they suspect it could be because the mineral contains asbestos, which is known to cause cancer when inhaled. The World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer considers talc \"possibly carcinogenic to humans,\" and the American Cancer Society has linked the powder to an increase risk of ovarian cancer. But the talcum powder industry says the IARC's assessment is based on data from only a small number of studies, and that any link between talc and cancer is unproven. On Thursday, a St. Louis jury awarded a 62-year-old California woman $70 million in damages, the third such verdict against Johnson & Johnson this year, reports Bloomberg. Deborah Giannecchini used the company's baby powder for feminine hygiene for four decades before she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2012. \"I've waited for a long time for this. I've wanted this so badly,\" Giannella says after the verdict. \"If this doesn't send a message, I'm going to file a class-action suit against them.\" (Critics say talcum powder is too toxic.)",

The 63-year-old Californian said those J&J products contributed to her developing ovarian cancer. The jury voted against J&J 10-2\u2014one of the dissenters actually didn't think the award was enough\u2014with an award of $575,000 in medical damages, $2 million in compensatory damages, $2.5 million in compensatory damages against Imerys Talc (the producer of the talcum powder), and $65 million in punitive damages against J&J. About half of the punitive damages will go to the Missouri Crime Victims' Compensation Program, per Jim Onder of Onder Law, which has handled all three cases with awarded damages so far. Memos from inside J&J show the company knew for decades about research tying the use of talc powder to ovarian cancer, Onder says\u2014though CNBC says \"much\" of that research has been \"weak.\" Giannecchini, however, had no clue of possible risks. \"There isn't a way to describe how you feel ... when you're told you probably won't make it beyond the next year,\" she says of receiving her stage 4 cancer diagnosis in 2012. Per her lawyers, Giannecchini has about an 80% chance of dying within the next two years, Bloomberg reports. Not that Onder expects J&J to cede to the nearly 2,000 state and federal complaints against it; instead, he believes the company will take a \"scorched-earth legal policy\" and not settle \"until they absolutely have to.\" In a statement, a J&J rep says the company will appeal because it's \"guided by the science, which supports the safety of Johnson's Baby Powder.\""

So, really this was a new instance for us.\" Officials haven't disclosed whether the dogs were drinking Flint water, how much lead was in their systems, or what symptoms they were showing. \"I think the key thing is, as pet owners you know what is the normal routine for your pet,\" Averill says. \"So what pet owners need to be looking for is the animal having their normal behavior in their normal routine, as they are creatures of habit.\" He says owners should get their water tested, get a filter in place, and \"water your pets through that filtered water.\"",

Both dogs are alive, Averill notes, but the state report doesn't specify how high their lead levels were, or what symptoms they had. And indeed, it's challenging to diagnose dogs with lead toxicity, as symptoms such as \"mental dullness,\" arthritis, and lethargy can mimic those of other illnesses, Averill says. Instead, he mentions keeping an eye on variations in a pet's routine to help pinpoint if something's wrong. He does note to CBS, however, that the \"vast majority\" of lead tests on area dogs have come back negative, and he says they're relying on local veterinarians with \"boots on the ground\" to look out for suspicious cases. In the meantime, while Averill gives the OK to bathe pets in Flint-area tap water, he says they should be drinking filtered or bottled water or, as a last resort, melted snow. \"It would be safer, if your only other choice is feeding them straight Flint water,\" he notes.

Scott Fitzgerald hung out in that doesn\u2019t have a damn cocktail?\" Everyone bought the story (even the historian known as Dr. Cocktail who wrote a book about vintage spirits) and loved the drink, which is made with bourbon, triple sec, bitters, sparkling wine, and garnished with an orange twist. Even the hotel is sticking with the drink as its signature cocktail, saying it's become a hotel tradition and \"will remain part of its future.\" (This is Obama's cocktail of choice.)"

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 The number of newborns in the US who are circumcised has dropped by 10% over the past 32 years, according to a new CDC report. Some 58.3% of newborns were circumcised in 2010, down from 64.5% in 1979 and the lowest rate since the survey began in 1978, the New York Times reports. The CDC doesn't recommend the practice, but the American Academy of Pediatrics does, and the AAP's policy statement states that \"despite potential medical benefits to newborn male circumcision, there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine circumcision of newborns.\" The lead author of the report says the fall \"is a good thing,\" as it shows parents that \"the health and well-being of their children is not at risk.\" But a rep for the anti-circumcision group Family Research Council says there's still \"a lot of uncertainty\" about the health risks. A University of Michigan study last year found that men are more likely to be infected with HIV if they're circumcised than if they don't, and Denmark is poised to take the first step toward a ban on the practice. In the 1980s and '90s, circumcision rates were on the rise in the West, while they were down in the Midwest, South, and Northeast.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 \"To be circumcised should be an informed, personal choice,\" or so thinks the Danish Medical Association, which on Friday issued its recommendation that no boy under age 18 in the country be circumcised. Going that route then leaves the door open for the male to make a decision of his own \"when he has come of age,\" says Lise Moller, the head of the association\u2019s ethics board. That's not to say the doctors' group is calling for a ban, which it says it weighed and decided against due to cases where male circumcision is medically necessary and for the potential for clandestine botched procedures, says Moller. Had they wanted a ban, they'd possibly face a steep slope. In a June report to the UN, Denmark agreed with Egypt's stance that it is a parental right to circumcise one's male child, reports the Copenhagen Post. Still, the Local reports that 74% of respondents to a 2014 survey said they'd support a full or partial ban. An estimated 1,000 to 2,000 circumcisions take place in Denmark each year, and the country should have a firmer idea of that number as of Jan. 1, after which all circumcisions must be logged in Denmark's national patient registry, reports the Local. Doctors who fail to do so will be fined, reports the Post. The CDC reports that in 2010, an estimated 58% of male newborns were circumcised in the US.

But there's a solution, and it comes courtesy of a company called MOTUS: a snow shovel with a D-grip that's designed to alleviate wrist and back pain, as well as improve posture, according to MOTUS. The company's website explains that the straight grip and T-grip (for pushing and pulling) are designed \"to make snow shovels easier to work with\" and \"restraint the tissues located on the end of the range of wrist and tendons ... [to] reduce the risk of repetitive stress injury.\" But it's not just your wrists that may be feeling the effects of shoveling: A study published in the American Journal of Sports Medicine found that people who used a straight grip on their shovels for at least two hours a day experienced less pain in their wrists than did those who didn't use the grips, reports Today.com. And if you've ever griped a bottle of wine with a straight arm, you're in for a treat: Scientists say they've discovered a way to reduce the amount of force required to hold the bottle, Popular Science reports. \"This is substantial in the order of about 5% overall decrease in the energy required for a single execution task,\" says a study co-author. \"If you can reduce the load in the moment of doing a task by 5%, that\u2019s equivalent to cutting the weight of your upper body by about 10%.

Beyond that, however, the recommendations get muddled, notes Timothy Noah on Slate: Shovels that make it easier to gather the snow make it harder to lift the snow, and vice versa. There is one obscure shovel supposedly better suited to both parts of the job, but good luck finding one in a hardware store. A few other things will lessen your risk: Don\u2019t start shoveling while snow is still falling (it\u2019s colder, so you\u2019ll put additional strain on your heart); don\u2019t bundle up too much (getting too hot isn\u2019t good, either); and don\u2019t drink coffee (it increases your heart rate) or hot cocoa (who knows why?) right before shoveling. If that all sounds like too much trouble, \u201cwait till someone younger or poorer than you knocks on your door and offers to shovel your walk for $20 or $30,\u201d Noah recommends. \u201cDelegate.

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 William Shakespeare's famous Stratford-upon-Avon garden is home to some 400 tobacco pipes dating back to the early 17th century. But what was in those pipes? Four of them contained traces of cannabis, according to a study published in the South African Journal of Science. Researchers believe Shakespeare was high on cannabis, possibly because he was aware of the negative effects of cocaine, per a press release. In one of his sonnets, he writes about \"invention in a noted weed.\" In another, he refers to \"compounds strange\" and says he would prefer not to be associated with \"strange drugs.\" Researchers believe the pipes were smoked by Sir Francis Drake, Sir Walter Raleigh, and others. Drake brought coca leaves to England from Peru, and Raleigh brought North American \"tobacco leaves\" (Nicotiana) from Virginia. But it's unclear if Drake and Raleigh were the same person, or if other people, including Shakespeare, smoked tobacco. In addition to cannabis, the study found evidence of cocaine in two of the pipes. It's possible other people smoked tobacco in the garden, but\u2014 Traces of Cocaine, marijuana, and tobacco have been found in 24 clay pipes found on the grounds of William Shakespeare\u2019s home in Stratford-on-Avon. The clay pipes were analyzed by researchers from South Africa\u2019s Transvaal Museum. The researchers speculate that Shakespeare and other members of his court smoked tobacco, nutmeg, and hallucinogenic extracts while performing their plays in the court of Queen Elizabeth I. \"One can well imagine the scenario in which Shakespeare performed his plays in a smoke-filled haze.\"",

Something had been smoked in the pipe bowls and stems unearthed from William Shakespeare' garden in Stratford-upon-Avon; the question was what. Researchers in South Africa now have gas chromatography mass spectrometry to thank for their answer. A piece in the Conversation based on the report published in the South African Journal of Science explains the \"technique is very sensitive to residues that can be preserved in pipes even if they had been smoked 400 years ago.\" Eight of the 24 pipe-fragment samples tested were shown to contain cannabis; another had evidence of nicotine, and two more \"evidence for Peruvian cocaine from coca leaves.\" Of those, only four of the cannabis samples were from Shakespeare's garden; the others were from the Stratford-upon-Avon area. Study author Francis Thackeray writes that the research establishes that a wide range of plants were smoked in the area during the early 17th century, and he leans on Shakespeare's own words to try to draw connections. Thackeray references Sonnet 76, which refers to \"invention in a noted weed\"; he interprets weed as cannabis and invention as writing. As for whether we can conclude that Shakespeare got high, Thackeray writes \"one can well imagine\" it. (In April, Texas researchers reported another Shakespeare find.)"

Activists used a ladder to put a rope around the statue's neck before a group of people pulled it to the ground, the News & Observer reports. Protesters, who had gathered outside the old courthouse building in Durham in response to the weekend violence in Charlottesville, then kicked and spat on the statue. The bronze statue of a soldier holding a muzzleloading rifle was erected in 1924, with the words \"In Memory of the Boys Who Wore the Gray\" engraved on the pillar, reports CNN. Police officers filmed the toppling of the statue. No arrests were made, though North Carolina brought in a law in 2015 banning the removal of monuments to the Confederacy from public property without permission from state officials, the AP reports. Police say they didn't arrest anybody because the toppling took place on county property. \"The racism and deadly violence in Charlottesville is unacceptable, but there is a better way to remove these monuments,\" tweeted Gov. Roy Cooper. Protesters called for the removal of other monuments to the Confederacy, including the \"Silent Sam\" statue on the University of North Carolina's Chapel Hill campus."

But though she was the first Korean to receive such an honor, Choi wasn't happy living under guard. While promoting a movie in Vienna in March 1986, Choi and Shin sought asylum at the US embassy. The pair\u2014who would spend more than a decade in the US before returning to South Korea in 1999\u2014would later reveal secret recordings in which Kim apologized for the kidnapping scheme, per CNN.

The suit says Bavaria and the Bayerische Staatsgemaldesammlungen have refused their demands for the paintings, including several displayed at Munich's Pinakothek der Moderne museum, despite its public commitment to \"fair and just\" treatment for Nazi-looted art, Reuters reports. The Hultons say some of the paintings may have passed through the hands of Hildebrand Gurlitt, one of four dealers the Nazis let sell \"degenerate\" art they disliked, and who had amassed a cache of roughly 1,400 works discovered in his reclusive son Cornelius's Munich apartment in 2012.

The widow of Flechtheim's sole heir (his nephew) and the nephew's son cite \"a presumption of international law\" that sales of Jewish property after Jan. 30, 1933, aren't legitimate because they were made under duress. And so in the case of the six paintings by Max Beckmann and two others by Juan Gris and Paul Klee, timing is the issue. The Bavarian State Paintings Collection argues the paintings, worth up to $20 million, were sold by Flechtheim in 1932.

It's so far away, in fact, that scientists were able to peer back 13.1 billion years, to the time when the universe was just 700 million years old. \"That means that when we are looking at the sun, we are actually looking at its light as it was eight minutes ago,\" an astronomer tells the Washington Post. \"In other words, we're looking 95% of the way back to the Big Bang. To put that into human terms, that would be.\" Researchers used images from the Hubble Space Telescope to identify 43 possible faraway galaxies, then used state-of-the-art spectrographic equipment at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii to confirm their distances. In the end, Finkelstein and his colleagues could only retrieve data from this lone galaxy. Light from this baby galaxy began its journey when the Universe was about 700 millions years old and just emerging from the cosmic mist left over from its birth, the lead author of the study tells the Los Angeles Times. The galaxy is believed to have formed its own stars 200 million years ago. That's a lot of stars in a single year, which is \"unusual,\" says Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. \"It's not unusual to find small galaxies at those early times, but finding such a small galaxy making so many stars at once is unusual.\" The discovery could shed light on how our universe came to be.",

Scientists say it formed a mere 700 million years after the Big Bang, and it could shed further light on how the universe came to be. The BBC adds this little mind-bender: \"Because it takes light so long to travel from the outer edge of the universe to us, the galaxy appears as it was 13.1 billion years ago.\" Not mind-bending enough? Try this from the Washington Post: \"We\u2019re looking 95 percent of the way back to the Big Bang.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House\u2014but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight\u2014which appears to be the likeliest scenario\u2014the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month\u2014and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon\u2014but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day\u2014and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University\u2019s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

Cops were investigating why the sewer cover was open. They described a steep drop into a storm drain that links to a water treatment plant. During heavy rains an overflow system discharges water directly into the river. A frantic search began Saturday morning after a passerby spotted the open sewer and beside it a baseball cap and umbrella believed to be Jacob's. Surveillance video confirmed the teen was in the area, WMUR reports. Jacob's family searched storm drains across the city, hoping perhaps he was trapped inside one and would hear their shouts. \"Maybe he might have fallen in and he\u2019s just hanging on, and maybe he\u2019s too cold to yell,\" his uncle, Darren Blouin, told WMUR.

That man is Col. Anatoliy Chepiga, who fought in the war in Chechnya and in 2014 received the state's highest award: Hero of the Russian Federation. The BBC notes the award is generally given by Vladimir Putin, who has previously stated that Boshirov and companion Alexander Petrov are merely civilians; the men have said they traveled to Salisbury as tourists to see a well known cathedral there. Bellingcat suspects the mission that spurred that honor was a secret one; while most recipients' heroics are described in detail, Chepiga simply received his award \"by decree from the Russian president.\" As for how the alleged identification came to be, Bellingcat explains a source suggested it look at whether the men could have attended the Far Eastern Military Command Academy, which had \"the best reputation for foreign-language training and overseas clandestine operations.\" It came upon a photo that it thought could be Boshirov and continued its web searching, which ultimately led it to Chepiga's name and passport file. A 2003 photo in the file \"strongly resembled a younger 'Boshirov.'\" The BBC had this to say: \"British officials have not commented.

A former UN special envoy for rhino conservation, Bradley Martin began his efforts in earnest in the 1970s, when the number of elephants being slaughtered for their ivory spiked. That's when he left the US for Kenya, and his work helped put an end to the sales of rhino horn and ivory in China. His travels also took him to Vietnam and Laos, where last year he and another researcher revealed the latter country's ivory trade was the fastest growing in the world. Their work there involved the dangerous ploy of pretending they were buyers and staying in a casino frequented by organized-crime members and traffickers, all so they could find out what the going price for ivory was. Local police say they've already questioned a cook and gardener at Bradley Martin's home and have come up empty so far on suspects."

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 In Belgium, euthanasia is legal for people with \"constant and unbearable physical or psychological suffering.\" But for those suffering from a mental illness, it's not, the New York Times reports. That's because the country requires an independent assessment from at least two other doctors before a patient can end his or her own life. But in a recent case, two doctors\u2014one who had already approved euthanasia for the patient, and one who didn't\u2014say the patient was misled into thinking the request would be approved. \"They say things that are not always correct,\" says Dr. Michel Distelmans. The Wall Street Journal reports on the case of Tine Nys, a 41-year-old woman who suffered from severe depression and tried to end her life multiple times before her death in 2015. Nys' sister, Sophie, filed a criminal complaint against psychiatrist Marie-Claire Thienpont and her colleagues after she says they failed to administer life-ending drugs. The criminal complaint was dismissed last year. The doctors are accused of not having properly prepared the case, the first criminal investigation in a euthanasia case since the practice was legalized in 2002.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Belgian doctors accused of improperly euthanizing a woman with autism will see their case go to trial, marking \"the first time that there has been a decision to refer such a case to a court of law\" since the practice was legalized in 2002, a prosecutor tells the AFP. Three doctors from East Flanders are being investigated on suspicion of having \"poisoned\" Tine Nys in 2010. The 38-year-old had been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome two months before she died in an apparently legal killing by a doctor. Sophie Nys, one of Tine's sisters, told the AP of \"irregularities\" in the process: that the doctor who performed the euthanasia asked her parents to hold the needle in place while he administered the fatal injection, among other fumbling efforts. Afterward, the doctor asked the family to use a stethoscope to confirm that Tine's heart had stopped. Last year, the AP reported that after Nys' family filed a criminal complaint, her doctors attempted to block the investigation. \"We must try to stop these people,\" wrote Dr. Lieve Thienpont, the psychiatrist who approved Nys' request to die\u2014and one of the doctors now facing charges. \"It is a seriously dysfunctional, wounded, traumatized family with very little empathy and respect for others.\" Nys also alleged that her sister's longtime psychiatrist wouldn't give Tine the OK, and that Thienpoint did so after as few as two or three sessions with her. Belgium is one of two countries, along with the Netherlands, where euthanasia of people for psychiatric reasons\u2014including depression, personality disorder and Asperger's\u2014is allowed if they can prove they have \"unbearable and untreatable\" suffering."

Japan finally has an estimate on how much radiation has been released: The level is an indication of the total radioactive materials emitted. Data has revealed that the cumulative amount of radioactive particles released into the atmosphere had reached levels that apply to a Level 7 incident, reports the AP. So what is that estimate? According to two estimates, the equivalent of about 500,000 terabecquerels of radiation from iodine-131 has been released. The Level 7 threshold is \"several tens of thousands of terabecquerels.\" But all 7s are not created alike: The Wall Street Journal notes that officials were careful to say this this is still not a Chernobyl-size disaster. \"The amount of released radiation is about a tenth of Chernobyl\"\u2014about 5.2 million terabecquerels\u2014said a rep for Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency. But it could still top Chernobyl in one regard: TEPCO today warned that the plant continues to release radioactive materials, and that the total levels emitted could eventually top those released by Chernobyl. Level 7 also indicates widespread effects on the environment and health: The Telegraph noted that Japan's safety commission now says radiation in excess of the amount considered safe for humans during an entire year has been found as far as 37 miles from the plant; the evacuation zone is only 18 miles. Is there another big one we haven't been talking about? Sort of. Besides Chernobyl, Time notes that a 1957 accident in Kyshtym, Russia, was the only one that's come close to being a 7; it was a 6. Most nuclear accidents tend to be a 3 or less."

Scientists discovered that fiber releases a molecule called acetate into the gut that tells the body to stop eating, they report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Acetate is produced when plants and vegetables are digested by bacteria in the colon, and it eventually ends up in the hypothalamus region of the brain, which controls hunger\u2014and scientists say they've figured out why fiber keeps us full for longer and may lead to new, non-surgical treatments for obesity. \"Being able to influence the balance of gut and brain may be the key to developing new interventions for obesity,\" says a biochemist in the study, published in Nature Communications. \"There has been lots of epidemiological information showing a relationship between fiber and obesity, and no one has been able to connect the epidemiological results with actual mechanisms,\" he tells the New York Times. \"Until now, a high-fibre diet was thought to help keep weight down by stimulating the release of appetite-suppressing hormones in the gut, but humans do not seem to show the same increase in these hormones that mice do.\" Mice injected with liposome made from a chemical found in rat placentas showed no sign of a type of white blood cell called T-cells after they were injected twice a day for four weeks, but after the second injection, they showed signs of T-cell production. acetate is believed to be a \"cheap and effective\" treatment for Alzheimer's disease.",

Acetate then makes its way to the brain's hypothalamus, where it builds up and triggers chemical reactions that tell us we're full, Time reports. Researchers reached this conclusion by scanning the progress of a dietary fiber called inulin through the bodies of mice. Those mice who ate fatty diets rich in inulin gained less weight than mice who didn't eat inulin. But one electrophysiologist not related to the study points out that the mice were fed dietary fiber levels of about 11%. He tells Nature that at such a level, \"the room would be full of mouse farts\"\u2014and perhaps the mice were eating less because they felt gassy. The researchers plan to next test the idea in humans. So could we eventually see an acetate-based diet pill?

Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is expected to designate two more national monuments\u2014the 1.3 million-acre Bears Ears National Monument and the 300,000-acre Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument\u2014in Utah on Thursday. \"Nothing could be further from the truth,\" Patagonia CEO Marcario says in a statement. \"This action is unprecedented and widely unpopular. It is also illegal, and Patagonia will be challenging his decision in court.\" Patagonia, which has donated more than $80 million to groups fighting to protect public lands, says selling off public land to the highest bidder \"also means that hunters, fishers, and others argue the president doesn't have that authority and his move jeopardizes a wealth of Native American artifacts, dinosaur fossils, and rugged spaces.\"",

The suit, which the AP notes was filed on behalf of several groups, says the proposed 85% reduction at Bears Ears is an \"extreme overreach in authority\" and puts at risk dinosaur fossils and Native American artifacts, among other resources. Patagonia owner Yvon Chouinard told CNN of his litigious plans earlier this week, noting, \"This government is evil, and I'm not going to sit back and let evil win.\" President Obama designated Bears Ears a national monument at the end of 2016; Grand Staircase-Escalante received the protection 20 years earlier from President Clinton. At the heart of the commotion is whether a current president can walk back a former president's creation of a national monument under the Antiquities Act, with Native American tribes, environmental groups, and paleontologists arguing that Trump doesn't have the authority to do so; two legal experts interviewed by the AP had varying opinions on the matter. NBC News, which notes the legal wrangling over the national monuments could stretch out for years, adds that Patagonia has long been active in fighting for Utah's public lands. The AP notes more lawsuits are anticipated, especially if Trump moves on Zinke's push to cut other national monuments. More in Time from Patagonia's CEO on why the company is suing."

The court documents also reveal that, according to Bitterman, Jace threatened to kill her if she \"went to war\" over visitation with Jordan. And, the Los Angeles Times reports, another filing shows that one of Bitterman's friends testified that she saw at least four violent incidents between the couple before they divorced, including one in which Jace \"choked and hit\" Bitterman and then \"slammed her against the wall\"\u2014as Jordan, then 6 months old, cried in his crib nearby. Jordan is now grown, but Jace's two young sons with April Jace were home when he allegedly killed their mother. Money problems may have been behind their fight."

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 If you're yawning a lot, check the temperature: Researchers say we may yawn when it's warm out because that cools down the brain. In the study, which agrees with earlier research, experts at the University of Vienna showed pictures of yawns to pedestrians in Austria and Arizona, ScienceDaily reports; they aimed to induce contagious yawning, ninemsn explains. After the study was conducted in both summer and winter, researchers found that such yawns occurred most often at temperatures around 68 degrees Fahrenheit. The scientists argue that there's a \"thermal window for yawning,\" and it opens when we're warm but the air is cool enough for a yawn to lower our temperatures, Time reports. Previous research has indicated that we yawn after our body temperatures rise. The study found that people's age, sex, and previous night's sleep, on the other hand, didn't have much of an effect on our yawning patterns. All this talk of temperature still fits the idea that we yawn when sleepy, ninemsn notes. Tiredness, stress, and a lack of stimulation can have an effect on our brain temperatures."

Scientists have discovered that the larvae of the Argentine horned frog emit a \"brief, clear, and very audible metallic-like sound\" when they feel threatened, the Telegraph reports. Horned frog tadpoles are naturally aggressive and carnivorous, and it is possible that the scream is mainly emitted when another horned Frog tadpole moves to attack it as a measure to avoid cannibalism. The discovery, reported in the Swedish journal Acta Zoological, is the first evidence for the production of sound by the larva of anurans (frogs and toads). It was made by Dr. Guillermo Natale of the National University of La Plata in Buenos Aires, and his colleagues, when they were studying the mating calls and croakings of adult frogs. Many adult amphibians use loud sounds such as croaks to advertise their presence, and often to attract sexual partners, but until now researchers did not realize amphibian larvae might also produce sounds underwater. That changed when Dr. Natale caught a horned frog tad pole in a pond using a hand-held net. \"We heard a brief, clear and very audibly metallic- like sound,\" he said. It's the first time any vertebrate larva has been found to use sound to communicate underwater, reports the BBC. The ability was discovered when scientists placed a live frog in a tank and played a recording of its distress call, which could be heard by millions of other frogs and salamanders living in the same tank.",

Instead of hugging the bottle, the wine fails to bridge the gap and simply falls directly into its intended vessel until it stops coming out entirely.

Biophysicist Daniel Perlman at Brandeis University, an inventor with more than 100 patents under his probably well-designed belt, says he's solved the age-old problem by etching a small groove into the bottle itself, per Phys.org. (You can see a demonstration via this video.) To arrive at his solution, Perlman studied slow-mo videos of wine being poured, then calculated precisely how large of an edge would be required to catch the offending drip. The answer: 2mm wide, 1mm deep. Gizmos already are on the market to stop the spills, while sommeliers might use a napkin to deftly wipe the bottle after a pour, but Perlman wanted to simplify things. \"I wanted to change the wine bottle itself,\" thus avoiding the need for an accessory, he says. Bloggers sound intrigued. The drip issue is a \"pretty obvious\" flaw that has been allowed to linger for as long as wine bottles have been made, complains a post at BGR.

The private prison industry is \"morally repugnant\" and creates a \"perverse incentive\" to keep jails filled, according to Sanders' campaign website, which says \"the measure of success for law enforcement should not be how many people get locked up.\" Private prisons, which house 19% of federal prisoners, were created to reduce overcrowding in public facilities, but have since become a $5 billion \"recession resistant\" investment, the Christian Science Monitor reports. Reform advocates say the industry reduces the motivation to rehabilitate prisoners because companies make a profit by keeping them imprisoned. A University of Wisconsin study released this spring found that private prison inmates often serve longer sentences, yet are just as likely to recidivate as those in public prisons. \"The profit motivation of private companies running prisons works at cross purposes with the goals of criminal justice,\" Sanders says. \"Criminal justice and public safety are without a doubt the responsibility of the citizens of our country, not private corporations. They should be carried out by those who answer to voters, not those who answered to investors.\" According to the Los Angeles Times, 8.4% of people in federal and state prisons in 2013 were in private facilities.",

Kris Maharaj, 75, was sentenced to death in 1987 for the 1986 killings of his business partner, Derrick Moo Young, and Young's 23-year-old son, Duane, in a Miami hotel. Maharaj says he was there to settle a $441,000 investment dispute, but he left before they arrived and was killed. But his lawyers say they have a \"treasure trove\" of documents\u2014including fake letters of credit from Pablo Escobar's Medellin cocaine cartel\u2014that prove Maharaj was framed. Among them: records from the Plaza Hotel showing the Youngs were involved in drug dealing and money laundering, reports the Miami Herald. Maharaj's conviction was later reduced to life, and he was taken off death row in 2002 but resentenced to life a year later. His lawyers plan to call 53 witnesses at an evidentiary hearing next week, including six who say Maharaj was 30 miles away from the hotel at the time of the murders. The state, however, says much of the material is hearsay and inadmissible in any new trial. \"Kris Maharaj is so patently innocent that it is unimaginable to me that the state of Florida does not let him go,\" Clive Stafford Smith, who has written a book on the case, tells the Guardian. \"It is a very sad day when the government desperately wants to keep the wrong person in prison, such that they will not even investigate who the real is.\"",

CNN has a profile on Maharaj's case detailing how, in 1986, he was arrested for the Miami murders of his business partners Derrick and Duane Moo Young\u2014even though he had an alibi. Police said the Moo Youngs had cheated the former millionaire out of $400,000. He was found guilty and sentenced to death. That sentence has since been reduced to life in prison, but in April a Florida judge scheduled a November hearing to determine if new evidence could undermine the verdict. Maharaj's lawyers have 53 witnesses and 498 documents on tap, according to the Guardian. \"We've got several Colombian cartel people to say, 'We did the murders,'\" one lawyer says. These cartel witnesses say that the Moo Youngs were money launderers for the cartel, and were killed because they lost some of the money. The lawyers also say they can prove that prosecutors hid evidence that would have proved Maharaj's innocence. But in court filings, prosecutors say the evidence is all \"hearsay and inadmissible.\" (Click to read about how Escobar's hippos are causing problems in Colombia.)"

Clinton will be introduced by Elizabeth Warren, who's locked in possibly the nation's most competitive Senate race against Scott Brown. \"I'm going to talk about what I've talked about for years now,\" Warren told ABC last month. \"America's middle class is getting hammered and Washington is rigged to work for the big guy.\" It's worth noting that Brown didn't speak at the RNC. Warren won't be the only woman, either; Democrats intend to showcase many, USA Today reports, including Sandra Fluke, whom you might remember from her run-in with Rush Limbaugh. A number of CEOs are also on the docket, ready to affirm that an Obama presidency would indeed be good for business, the AP reports. Tonight will also mark Obama's official nomination. Since he ran essentially unopposed in the primary, this will simply be a roll-call of all the states, scheduled for after Clinton's speech.

Here are the top and bottom five, along with their favorable/unfavorable split: Most popular: Hawaii\u201454-10 (+44) Colorado\u201444-9 (+35) Tennessee\u201448-14 (+34) South Dakota\u201442-8 (+34) Virginia\u201445-13 (+32) Least popular: California\u201427-44 (-17) Illinois\u201419-29 (-10) New Jersey\u201425-32 (-7) Mississippi\u201422-28 (-6) Utah\u201424-27 (-3) Of course, most people are indifferent about most states, the Houston Chronicle observes, with an average of two-thirds of respondents saying they were \"not sure\" for each. But some states were quite polarizing; Democrats like California 91 points more than Republicans do, while Republicans like Texas 82 points more than Democrats."

It was once home to bits of forest, the scientists found using offshore plant DNA. In other words, as the International Business Times has it, \"Greenland really was green.\" The Greenland Ice Sheet that's there now, however, has been remarkably durable: The findings imply that it made it through a strong period of warming some 130,000 years ago. \"It's unlikely the ice sheet has disappeared for significant periods of time in the last three million years, at least at this one pinprick on this big island,\" Bierman says. \"Now human activity may spell the end of it.\" (What else lies under Greenland's ice?

The BBC recalls the crime: Sandra Rivett was beaten to death in the family's London home and her body left in the basement; Lord Lucan's estranged wife was also attacked but got away, fleeing to a neighboring pub and yelling \"He\u2019s in the house! He\u2019s murdered the nanny!\" per the Times. Lady Lucan named her then 39-year-old husband as the attacker, saying he had thought she was Rivett, reports USA Today. A June 1975 inquest named him as Rivett's murderer, except the man born Richard John Bingham was never officially seen again after that night; a car he had borrowed from a friend was later found, blood-stained and abandoned. The sightings and theories kept flowing, though: in Melbourne, Australia, and France within the first year; employed as a waiter in San Francisco; backpacking on Mount Etna; dying in Goa in 1996. Just last Saturday came a story from an old gambling friend, who says he was told that the lord shot himself and had his body fed to a tiger. Lucan was declared dead in 1996, but the rub was that son George Bingham was unable to take on his title, preventing him from assuming his father's seat in the House of Lords. The death certificate now allows for that."

She says she was one of the NPR women. She tells the Times she was invited to dinner at a seafood restaurant in Washington, DC, in 2015 to talk about her career at NPR.

Looking at 725 adult children from 309 families in the Within-Family Differences Study\u2014a longitudinal project documenting various aspects of relationships between parents and their adult children\u2014they say that depressive symptoms were most common in the adult children who claimed to be emotionally closer to their mother than their siblings, reports Medical News Today. That also held true for \"the children with whom their mothers had the greatest conflict, and in whom the mothers were most disappointed,\" write the authors. Interestingly, the study found no difference between male and female children, but it did find a racial disparity, notes Medical Daily. Adult black children felt their mother's disappointment more acutely than their white counterparts. Researchers hypothesize that sibling rivalry may be behind the depression, meaning more attention or support from mom doesn't necessarily beat out the negative attention from jealous siblings. Or that the favorites are more often asked to help the aging mother, which is its own source of stress. (The adult children in the study had mothers who were 65 to 75 when interviewed.) And yet a third possibility is posed by Bustle: A mother's attention may naturally drift toward the weakest or most sensitive child, thus her favoritism doesn't necessarily cause depression. Researchers plan to look at whether similar results play out with fathers, and whether it's possible to predict favoritism.

The appliance will sell for $59.99 and will ship starting Nov. 14th, per The Verge, which calls it \"a pretty dead-ahead 700W microwave.\" It features many of the standard microwave buttons, but most of the cooking presets are voice activated (such as \"Alexa, one potato,\" a command used by Amazon's David Limp a demonstration). You can also set it up to automatically order products from Amazon. \"What this microwave does is keep track of how many times you cook popcorn and make sure you never run out,\" Amazon VP Daniel Rausch tells the Wall Street Journal. Also debuted on Thursday were other smart devices, such as an Echo for cars and a home security system, as well as improvements to Alexa like the abilities to whisper and hold conversations. It all adds up to Amazon's push to \"unite a scattered industry,\" the WSJ notes. Through products like the new AmazonBasics microwave, the company hopes to get big manufacturers to use its Alexa-enabled chips affordable household appliances. As The Verge puts it: \"The point is to wow gadget makers with how simple, secure, and easy it is to integrate its Alexa Connection Kit.\""

In a study published in the American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse, researchers recruited 20 long-term AA members who reported no cravings for alcohol during the week preceding testing. The participants were placed in an MRI scanner and then shown either pictures of alcoholic drinks or people drinking to simulate drinking behavior in a laboratory setting. The pictures were presented twice: first after asking the participant to read neutral material from a newspaper, and again after the participant recited an AA prayer promoting abstinence from alcohol to represent the impact of AA. All research subjects reported some degree of craving for alcohol after viewing the images, and less craving after reciting anAA prayer. MRI data revealed that there were changes in parts of the prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain that controls attention, and in brain sites responsible for control of emotion and the semantic reappraisal of emotion, which represents the different ways a people understand situations based on their perspectives. \"This finding suggests that there appears to be an emotional\u2014Alcoholics Anonymous isn't just for the rich and famous\u2014it's for everyone, a new study finds,\" Galanter says in a press release. \"It's not a program for everybody.

A small new study out of the NYU Langone Medical Center finds that at least among 20 long-term Alcoholics Anonymous members who reported no cravings in the week leading up to the test, prayer reduced cravings that arose when shown images of alcoholic drinks or people drinking. To perform the tests, the researchers report in the American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse, participants were asked to read the newspaper or pray after being shown the images. Participants reported some craving following seeing the images, but less so after having prayed, while MRI data showed changes in parts of the prefrontal cortex that controls attention as well as in regions thought to control emotion. \"This finding suggests that there appears to be an emotional response to alcohol triggers, but that it\u2019s experienced and understood differently when someone has the protection of the AA experience,\" says senior author Marc Galanter, who published a book on Alcoholics Anonymous earlier this year. He goes on to suggest that the reduction in cravings in AA members correlates to the amount of time that has elapsed since one's so-called \"spiritual awakening,\" which AA describes as taking a different attitude toward drinking. In previous research, participants asked to pray every day for four weeks drank about half as much as those who were not. (See why some have been challenging the 75-year hegemony of AA.)"

That means some of our water must have predate the sun, when heavy hydrogen was in abundance. So, if water can survive a star's birthing process, and if other solar systems in the universe formed much like ours did, that means that water might be a common ingredient in the making of other planets far from our own.

Earth was actually \"born dry,\" in an extremely hot environment, according to the Times. Scientists believe we eventually received water via comets or asteroids that crashed down on Earth's surface. Figuring out where the water in the comets and asteroids came from, however, is another story, though researchers think they've narrowed it down to two possibilities: that the heavy deuterium water was dispersed among bodies in the solar system during the \"violent\" process of our sun's birth, or that the heavy water originated from ice found in the gas cloud from which our sun and solar system were born. Either way, researchers say this could indicate that young planets all around the universe contain water: According to scientists, there are up to 11 billion planets outside our own system that could house liquid water and, possibly, life, notes Time.

A straw hat worn by Leigh fetched $52,500, while a black bonnet donned by Leigh and Olivia de Havilland's character Melanie Wilkes sold for $30,000, Reuters reports. Tumblin seems happy to have been able to offer up his pieces, many of which have toured the country. \"I am really looking forward to walking through a museum and seeing something that I once owned,\" he said.

The flaw was that those locations could be seen by anyone in a group chat, even if the person who sent the message wasn't friends with everyone else in the group. And so Khanna developed a browser app called Marauder's Map that exposed, on a map, the geo-location data that was being shared. He tweeted about his Chrome extension and posted about it on Medium on May 26. By the 28th, CNN, the Washington Post, and many others had covered his findings; the extension was downloaded 85,000 times. That same day, Facebook asked Khanna to disable the app; he did. The company also deactivated location sharing on desktops and released a June 4 update that required users to opt in to location sharing. It also withdrew Khanna's internship, which was to start on June 1. The official reason given was a violation of the \"high ethical standards expected of interns,\" according to Boston.com. \"This mapping tool scraped Facebook data in a way that violated our terms,\" a Facebook rep tells the site.

In a Facebook post, he says he has \"done nothing wrong\" and has been the target of \"harassment, vengeance, and demonization,\" the Toronto Star reports. Three women have accused the 47-year-old host of hitting and choking them without their consent and verbally abusing them during sex, but he says the sex was consensual and he \"does not engage in non-consensual role play or sex and any suggestion of the contrary is defamatory.\" He adds that he was fired because he refused to \"walk away quietly\" and \"publicly suggest that this was my decision.\" He says he was \"stripped from my show, barred from the building, and separated from my colleagues\" over the weekend. The CBC announced Friday that it was investigating the allegations, and sources tell the Star that top CBC officials spent the weekend in closed-door meetings at their Toronto headquarters. The four women who came forward say they had dates with the host, the CBC reports. Keith Urban's radio show is on the air in the US for the first time, and it's causing quite a stir on social media, the Huffington Post reports. One of the many reactions: Urban himself tweeted a link to an excerpt of his new book, Out of the Woods, in which he talks about his experience as a gay man on a radio show. \"I've never been happier in my life,\" he says.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Early yesterday, the CBC announced that it was terminating the employment of Q radio host Jian Ghomeshi, explaining somewhat vaguely that \"information came to our attention recently that ... precludes us from continuing our relationship with Jian.\" The details didn't remain vague for long. The 47-year-old took to Facebook last night, writing that \"I was given the choice to walk away quietly and to publicly suggest that this was my decision. But ... that would be untrue.\" Ghomeshi's version of the truth is that an unnamed \"jilted\" ex has launched a smear campaign against him, centered around his bedroom activities, which he writes \"may not be palatable to some folks.\" Ghomeshi describes \"a mild form of Fifty Shades of Grey\": rough sex that was consensual and involved safe words. The Toronto Star tells it quite differently: It says it has heard allegations from three women (none willing to go on the record) who describe incredibly violent and non-consensual sex. One told the Star that Ghomeshi had expressed that he would be aggressive, which she took to mean \"he would want to pull my hair and have rough sex. ... [Later] he attacked me. Choked me. Hit me like I didn't know men hit women. I submitted.\" The women told the paper they have not gone to police, reportedly over concerns their names would leak or that sexual texts they sent Ghomeshi would be used against them; they cited the case of Carla Ciccone, who was lambasted online after publishing a story on XOJane about a date she had with a popular radio host and \"repulsive sexual predator.\" Ghomeshi plans to file a $50 million suit against the CBC today; Q is one of the most successful shows the network has ever run."

The Telegraph reports the 46-year-old Bras is the first chef to ask Michelin not to bestow a star without \"justifying his choice by a change in (restaurant) concept or closing the business.\" Bras, who opened Le Suquet in central France 20 years ago, says he wants to drop the stars before the level of stress that drove another three-star chef to suicide in 2003. \"That's in a corner of my mind,\" he says.

Bras, who took over the restaurant from his father, Michel, more than a decade ago, tells AFP he can no longer take reviewers showing up unannounced at any time, usually a few times a year. \"I want to feel free without asking myself whether my creations will please the Michelin inspectors,\" he says. He adds that the 2003 suicide of French chef Bernard Loiseau, whose restaurant had been rumored to being close to losing its third star, was a factor. His father is supportive of his decision, AFP reports, via Eater, and another three-star chef who shut his own restaurant tells the Telegraph, \"When the Michelin guide is no longer a driving force, it's better to change lanes.\" Bras knows this may knock him down a few pegs in the cooking world, but it doesn't faze him. \"Maybe I will be less famous, but I accept that,\" Bras tells AFP.

Clifford, who says she had an affair with Trump in 2006 before he became president, is suing to void a non-disclosure agreement and says Trump and Cohen have threatened her with \"millions of dollars in damages ($1M each time I speak out) if I tell the truth about what happened.\" In a statement to the Daily Beast, Daniels says she doesn't want to hurt attorney Michael Avenatti, but it's time to \"set the record straight.\" \"He has spoken on my behalf without my approval.

In her statement, Daniels alleges that Avenatti filed a defamation suit against President Trump in her name but against her wishes. (A judge ended up tossing the suit.) \"If he filed the case with her name when it was clear that she told him not to, then he could be sued for that,\" New York University Law School prof Stephen Gillers tells the DB. \"If true, she has a malpractice case against him.

Tehran has blamed Israel for a string of explosions that have hit Iranian nuclear targets, including the death of one of Natanz's top nuclear scientists.

It was assumed they'd stay behind to pick up the slack, and many more bosses \"don't understand or care, who fire women for being late once again, who say 'no' to time off for a doctor's.\" But Mary Elizabeth Williams at Salon thinks Foye's essay is \"a tie-in for a lighthearted novel about a woman who fakes a pregnancy in order to get some time off?\" We're a \"nation that hates children, parents, and families\u2014as a matter of policy, not just in bars and airplanes.\"",

But Foye has bigger fish to fry than working moms getting to leave work on time. She's advocating for \"meternity leave\" to balance out the maternity leave given to new moms. She defines meternity leave as \"a sabbatical-like break that allows women and, to a lesser degree, men to shift their focus to the part of their lives that doesn\u2019t revolve around their jobs.\" Foye says a meternity leave would allow childless women to get the time to refocus and reevaluate their lives\u2014time that is already afforded to new mothers. Foye actually took a meternity leave for herself and says the experience was invaluable. \"I may not have been changing diapers, but I grappled with self-doubt for the year and a half that I spent away from the corporate world,\" she writes. Obviously, Foye's opinion has been controversial. \"I have to laugh pretty hard at a Foye\u2019s description of maternity leave as a 'sabbatical-like break,'\" writes Mary Elizabeth Williams at Salon. \"It\u2019s not exactly a vacation,\" concurs Korin Miller at Women's Health Magazine. \"You're up every three hours to nurse. ... If you can squeeze in a five-minute shower, it's pretty much a damn miracle.\" And Laura June at New York Magazine points out only 13% of new moms in the US even get maternity leave."

The value of the whale-watching industry was estimated at $2.1 billion in 2008, the most recent year for which full data is available. Even though collisions with boats can hurt the animals, researchers are more concerned about effects such as not feeding or swimming away from boats, which takes energy. \"Badly run trips can translate into all sorts of negative reactions from the whales,\" says the head of the Responsible Whale Watch Program at the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society. \"They can stop resting or increase their respiratory rate.

The push began earlier this year when the Bank of England announced that Winston Churchill would replace prison reformer Elizabeth Fry on the 5-pound note. Critics pointed out that would leave no women on the nation's currency, except for the queen.

She was \"famous for being famous,\" as the New York Times put it, making her \"a forerunner to Paris Hilton.\" Now, after decades of keeping her true identity a secret, Angelyne is telling her side of the story for the first time to the Times. Goldberg, whose real name was Angelyne Lyne, was famous for her custom-made pink Corvette convertible, which she would drive around the city in. According to the THR, she was a \"single-handedly created and then inhabited a modern myth of LA: the platinum blond bombshell in the bright pink Corvette forever circumnavigating the city.\" In addition to driving the car, she sold merchandise under the Angelyne name and made a living hawking products. Goldberg died at the age of 63.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 About a year after Hollywood Reporter journalist Gary Baum profiled Angelyne, the mysterious billboard bombshell he describes as LA's \"modern myth,\" a hobbyist genealogist contacted him claiming to have proof of a compelling back story: that she was born in Poland to Holocaust survivors. Now, also for the Hollywood Reporter, Baum unravels what he believes is likely the iconic blonde's true identity, publishing yearbook photos, marriage certificates, and more. The woman who's adorned hundreds of billboards across LA since the 1980s under the one-name pseudonym Angelyne\u2014she's been called a precursor to other \"famous for being famous\" celebrities like Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian\u2014appears to have started off as Ronia Tamar Goldberg. She came to California in 1959 by way of Israel, and her mother died of cancer at the age of 44 when Goldberg, who upon arrival to LA became Renee, was just 14. Baum reached out to Goldberg's alleged younger sister, now Annette Block, and her husband, as well as an ex-husband and a stepsister, all of whom are generally hazy on details if willing to talk at all. Angelyne, for her part, has gone on AirTalk with host Larry Mantle to claim that the story contains \"a lot of inaccuracies\" and that the \"vindictive\" piece can never change the fact that she is \"not a woman\" but \"an icon.\" Indeed, she ran for mayor of Hollywood in 2008, per the Washington Post, and came in 28th out of 135 candidates; she also ran for governor of California in 2003 and, of course, has made numerous paid appearances at events and is the subject of a documentary. For now, the legend and sometimes-actress/singer who says she was orphaned at a young age and whose Hollywood start traces back to a 1974 porno tells Baum she wants to save her story for a memoir for \"my own financial interest.\" (The Kardashians have erected an elaborate and bizarre business empire.)"

According to one source, UN officials knew the report was \"potentially damaging,\" as it suggested WFP food aid cuts to the Rohingya over a two-year period were causing harm, even starvation. \"There was a real sense that they had things to hide,\" the source says. The WFP tells a very different story: The agency \"stands by its original assessment\" that 80,000 Rohingya children under the age of five were suffering from potentially fatal weight loss in Rakhine in July. However, the food situation will have changed since an \"upsurge in violence\" in August, \"just months before the next harvest,\" a rep tells the Telegraph. \"In a dynamic and evolving situation, it is important to coordinate closely with all partners, including the government,\" WFP adds, noting its decision to scrap the previous report came \"following a request by the government to conduct a joint review.\" That review has stalled with Myanmar keeping agencies out of the conflict zone, however.

Under a plea deal, the 41-year-old will spend between three and eight years in prison. Prosecutors say Sandusky pressured a teenage girl under 16 to send him nude photos, the New York Times reports. After her father reported messages from Sandusky to police last year, investigators discovered that he had asked the girl's sister to perform oral sex on him in 2013, when she was 13. He pleaded guilty to charges including soliciting sex from a child younger than 16. Authorities say Sandusky, a former state prison guard who knew the girls through dating their mother, tried to persuade them that what he was doing was normal, saying \"it's not weird because he studied medicine,\" but asking them not to show his messages to anybody. Sandusky, like his mother, Dottie, loyally supported his father through his trial for the sexual abuse of 10 boys, the Times notes. Sandusky will now be classed as a Tier III sex offender, Pennsylvania's highest level, meaning he will have to register with state police for life and verify his information four times a year.

Without radio signals from Earth, China will require additional satellite technology to communicate with the probe.

Mashable notes it's hardly unprecedented for an astronaut to be pulled from a mission, and outlines the reasons that have surfaced in past instances, including medical issues. A former NASA administrator tells Syracuse.com that the likelihood is high Epps will make it to space. \"When [crew changes] do happen, the reassigned astronauts almost always fly on a later mission. The exceptions are very few and far between.\" Sean O'Keefe further speculates that Au\u00f1\u00f3n-Chancellor's medical background might be better suited to the mission's human research experiments than Epps, who is an engineer.

Sources also tell the New York Times that the Justice Department warned the White House on Jan. 26 that Flynn had misled Pence about his conversations with Sergey Kislyak, though it's not clear whether Trump was aware of that legal review at the time of his request for Flynn's resignation on Monday. A senior administration official tells CNN that Trump asked Flynn to resign because his \"level of trust\" with the president had \"evolved to the point where he felt he had to make a change.\" Rush Limbaugh, meanwhile, says the resignation was a \"political assassination\" carried out by the media, the Hill reports. On his radio show Tuesday, Limbaugh accused the media of having a scalp. \"The media's going to try as hard they can not to let go of this, because now they've got their scalp,\" he said. \"They think they have blood in the water.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 President Trump knew that Mike Flynn had misled VP Mike Pence about his contacts with the Russian ambassador weeks before Pence was informed, it emerged Tuesday as the national security adviser's resignation continued to rock the administration. Pence spokesman Marc Lotter tells the Washington Post that the vice president \"became aware of incomplete information\" on Feb. 9 following a Post story on the issue. The White House, however, says Trump and other top administration officials were briefed on the Justice Department's concerns about Flynn at least two weeks earlier. \"It's not that he was being left out. It was a legal review,\" an administration source tells CNN. In other developments: The FBI interviewed Flynn in late January after it warned the Trump administration that he could be blackmailed, the New York Times reports. If authorities determine that he lied during that interview, he could face felony charges. In an interview with the Daily Caller hours before his resignation, Flynn insisted there were \"no lines crossed\" in his conversation with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. \"It wasn't about sanctions. It was about the 35 guys who were thrown out,\" Flynn said, referring to former President Obama's expulsion of Russian diplomats in December. \"It was basically, 'Look, I know this happened. We'll review everything.' I never said anything such as, 'We're going to review sanctions,' or anything like that.\" Legal experts tell Politico that Flynn faces a real risk of prosecution if he wasn't truthful with the FBI, and claiming to have forgotten parts of the conversation probably won't work. Lawyer Mark Zaid says a puzzling aspect of the case is that, as a former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Flynn must have known that conversations with ambassadors from countries like Russia would be under surveillance. Republican senators are among those calling for a full investigation of the Flynn affair, but he still has his defenders, including Rush Limbaugh. On Tuesday, the radio host described pressure on Flynn as a \"political assassination\" by the media, the Hill reports. \"They think they have blood in the water, they've got a scalp, and they think they can get another and then another and then another and then another until finally they get Trump,\" he said. The BBC reports that Pence and other top US officials will be in Europe later this week to reassure American allies\u2014though NATO allies will apparently be untroubled by the departure of Flynn, who was seen as \"a bizarre and destabilizing appointment.\""

Brennan\u2014who leaves office Friday, along with other Obama administration officials\u2014also warned Trump against \"absolving Russia of various actions that it's taken in the past number of years\" and said it was \"outrageous\" that Trump had compared the intelligence community to Nazi Germany, the BBC reports.

One possibility is that the tsunami was caused by an undersea landslide. Such a landslide would have displaced water and created waves, and the earthquake may have caused the rupture zone of the fault to move through an area where the seafloor rises or drops off, pushing seawater in front of it. Other possibilities are that the quake itself caused the tsunami, or that it was triggered by an earthquake-induced rupture on a strike-slip fault, reports the BBC.

Tsunamis like the 18-foot monster wave that wrecked cities on Sulawesi island are usually caused by \"megathrust\" earthquakes that move land vertically, not \"strike-slip\" quakes like the 7.5-magnitude one Friday, which moved the earth horizontally, Patton says. The Sulawesi event was, however, localized, unlike the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. It may have been the case, Patton says, that massive undersea landslides created the tsunami, or that the narrow bay that Palu sits at the end of concentrated the wave's power. Indonesian authorities have been strongly criticized for apparently canceling the tsunami alert too early, though expert Adam Switzer at the Earth Observatory of Singapore tells the AP that this is unfair. \"What it shows is that the tsunami models we have now are too simplistic,\" he says. \"They don't take into account multiple events, multiple quakes within a short period of time.

The Walt Disney Co. has been awarded a patent for a \"system and method using foot recognition to create a customized guest experience,\" the Orlando Sentinel reports. The system would involve a robot or mobile scanning mechanism that would use a foot scanner to take depth information and a camera to take appearance information of a guest's foot, then use that data to determine various factors like the most popular rides and common paths guests take from ride to ride. \"Less invasive manners, such as comparing a user's clothing or the like, can produce inaccurate results as many guests may have similar clothing or may change clothing, such putting on or taking off an outer layer or sweater, which can make detection unreliable,\" the patent states. Disney hopes the data will help improve management and future planning. The patent also describes the use of concealed sensors throughout a theme park that would track the guests' movements. It states the foot scanners would be able to take detailed information on a shoe, including the color, tread and wear patterns, stains, and even if gum were on the bottom of the shoe\u2014all to reduce confusion of following the wrong guest on the data collecting side.

Specifically, the patent titled System and method using foot recognition to create a customized guest experience would scan guests shoes when they enter the park then track them as the move about. According to the Orlando Business Journal, this would allow Disney to track guests' favorite rides and paths through the park. It could also allow them to have Donald Duck greet guests by name or get souvenir photos or videos to them more quickly. The scanners could discern everything from shoe color, to wear patterns, to gum stuck on the sole. Disney filed for the patent back in 2015; it was issued by the US Patent & Trademark Office on July 19. The company, however, says it has no plans to actually use its foot camera patent. A spokesperson tells the Times that Disney files a lot of patents in an \"ongoing effort to relentlessly innovate and push the boundaries of creativity and technology to create immersive experiences and legendary guest service.\" Disney had already decided against biometric scanning\u2014such as fingerprinting, retinal scans, and facial recognition\u2014to track visitors because it considers it too invasive, the Stack reports. Plus those methods can be thrown off by things like hats and sunglasses. The company also didn't want to track clothing because that would \"require cameras that are visible to the person.\" The shoe-scanning cameras throughout the park would be \"out of a person's line of sight.\" (But will members of \"Club 33\" have their photos taken?)"

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Steven Avery has filed a fresh appeal in his Wisconsin murder case\u2014and thanks to the hit Netflix documentary Making a Murderer, there are now a lot more people paying attention. The appeal filed in a Madison court on Monday, which can be seen in full here, accuses authorities of searching his property illegally and claims that a juror with a preconceived notion that he was guilty improperly influenced other jurors during his 2007 trial for the murder of Teresa Halbach, the AP reports. Avery recently secured new legal representation from Chicago-area lawyer Kathleen Zellner and the Midwest Innocence Project, reports WBAY, but Monday's court filing appears to have been prepared without the new legal team. Zellner specializes in reversing convictions, and she says she has found new evidence that will exonerate Avery, reports NBC News. The Netflix documentary suggests that Avery\u2014who served 18 years for a rape he didn't commit before being released two years before the Halbach murder\u2014is the victim of a conspiracy, and a petition urging President Obama and Gov. Scott Walker to free him now has more than 415,000 signatures. Walker, however, has never pardoned anybody, and WBAY reports that he has signaled he isn't going to start with Avery. Netflix viewers \"should read the unanimous opinion of the Court of Appeals before jumping to conclusions,\" he said in a Facebook post."

It depicts a wedding between a princess from the Kaanul dynasty and a King of La Corona. \"This altar shows us a part of Guatemala's history, and in this case, around 1,500 years ago, I would say it's one of the best altars of its kind in the world,\" BarrientoS tells the New York Times. \"It's a high-quality work of art that shows us they were rulers entering into a period of great power and who were allying themselves with others to compete.\" La Corona \"was the place where the most important historical Mayan political movement began to take shape\" in the sixth century, when the Serpent Kingdom expanded from its capital of Dzibanche to La Corona, according to the Times. It's believed the altar dates back to May 12, 544 AD, the day Chak took over Tikal, the capital of the Kaenul dynasty, 20 years before he became a vassal and ruler of the larger city of Peru-Waka. But the gods associated with him are different from those associated with the area, the AP reports.

Discovered in 2017 at the Guatemalan site of La Corona, the nearly 1,500-year-old engraving depicts a king named Chak Took Ich'aak conjuring gods from a shaft shaped like a snake. Ich'aak later governed the nearby city of El Peru-Waka, suggesting that the so-called Serpent Kingdom or Kaanul dynasty forged a movement that grew until it defeated the towering city-state of Tikal in 562 A.D. \"...

Team leader Marcello Canuto sees the dynasty rising up with a mix of cultural appropriation, like conjuring old gods on the tablet to gain legitimacy; marriage, with a princess from neighboring Mexico; and other alliances with powerful forces. Otherwise, beating Tikal \"would be the equivalent to Cuba defeating the United States in a war,\" says Canuto. \"They could only have done that ... if they had had the backing of the Soviet Union.\" Announced Wednesday, the altar is on display at the National Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology in Guatemala City, per the Times-Picayune."

Samuelson sides with Ben, adding that prices could rise faster than wages, hurting spending. \"None of this is preordained,\" Samuelson writes. \"Economists have exaggerated their understanding and control of the economy. People don't often act according to academic theories.\" Krugman actually responded, praising Samuelson for making \"a serious effort\" to tackle the tough issue.

Vox explains the group, which falls to the far right on economic issues, has been feuding with Trump since he announced his run. Though Trump's views on immigration make him seem like a far-right candidate, his promises of \"no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid\" and higher taxes on the wealthy place him closer to the left. \"When Republicans run in primaries with a platform like Trump's, the club tries to take them down,\" reports Vox. \"That's its whole reason for being.\" The Club's president David McIntosh wasted no time in attacking Trump back in June, noting he was \"not a serious candidate.\" But things heated up weeks later when Trump shared a letter from McIntosh asking for a $1 million contribution.

In two new studies published in Science, researchers say that by 320,000 years ago, the first Homo sapiens were in the region of Olorgesailie in what is now Ethiopia, Science News reports. \"Social networking during a long period of climate variability was a key to success for early Homo sapiens,\" says one of the researchers. \"Greater mobility encouraged inventive thinking about how to acquire resources.\" The team also found evidence of the first mass-produced stone tools in Africa\u2014small, flatter, sharper tools that date back 300,000 years to the start of the Middle Stone Age, which happens to be tens of thousands of years earlier than previously thought. \"I think of the hand axes as the Swiss army knife,\" says a paleoanthropologist not involved in the study. The discovery is evidence of a \"long-term trend of climate-driven behavior,\" the researchers say, and it suggests that Homo sapiens or their relatives became more and more sophisticated toolmakers as the region's climate shifted from dry to wet.

Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups\u2014it's not clear which species is responsible\u2014had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools \u2026 designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"

Either policymakers accept a balance approach, Obama argued, or the GOP will be exposed as deficit frauds who care about protecting the rich at the expense of everyone else.\" Robert Frank, Wall Street Journal: \"Obama has a new term for the people he wants to tax more: jet owners. ... The problem is that most of the people that would be subject to the higher taxes the president wants aren\u2019t likely to be private-jet owners.

The newspaper, quoting military sources, says a Canadian sniper in Iraq killed an ISIS militant from the mind-boggling distance of 3,540 meters, or 2.2 miles. The Canadian military has not confirmed what would be the longest kill shot by a sniper in history, but the story has in the meantime drawn attention to something else: the remarkable prowess of Canadian snipers in general. Some coverage: The training: If confirmed, that means the sniper record has been broken four times in the last 15 years, three of those times by Canadians, notes Maclean's magazine. One reason, it says, is because Canadian snipers \"are not simply taught to hit their targets.\" The training goes beyond their shooting duties, making sure they're able to \"design and run complex operations\" if necessary. \"That in itself may not make them better snipers but the gestalt of sniper-training and command-thinking combined could explain their skill.\" Long history: The CBC examines the history of Canada's military marksmanship, noting that Cpl. Francis Pegahmagabow of the 1st Canadian Infantry Battalion had 378 kills, making him deadliest sniper of World War I. A military historian says the skill carried into WWII. \"The best snipers were usually country boys who knew how to hunt.\" Official statement: The Canadian military has not confirmed the kill, but it did confirm the shot. \"A member of the Joint Task Force 2 successfully hit a target from 3,540 meters,\" it says in an email to NPR, adding that it won't divulge further details for troop safety. Really? The Globe and Mail says the shot was verified by video and data, but that hasn't emerged yet, and some are skeptical. The Washington Post talks to former US snipers who say that even seeing a human target would be difficult from that distance, even with advanced scopes. A theory floated by a former Marine shooter: \"A spotter with an advanced optical device was able to verbally walk the sniper onto the target and correct his aim.\u201d Yes: Canadian Cpl. Rob Furlong, who once held the record himself at 2,430 meters, counters the skeptics: \u201cIt\u2019s not an impossible distance,\u201d he says. \u201cSo to the naysayers I would just say, this can be done.\u201d It's a \"hell of a shot,\" adds former Canadian sniper Jody Mitic, who was written a book called, of course, Unflinching: The Making of a Canadian Sniper. A critic: In a post at Stuff.co.nz, John Edens thinks the shot was possible, given high-tech gizmos to account for everything from wind speed to the curvature of the earth. Plus, the gun used, a McMillan TAC-50 rifle, employs a 50-caliber bullet the size of a \"large cigar.\" His beef, though, is with media coverage that he thinks glorifies war. \"It's an achievement to a point, but it's not really one humanity should be proud of.\""

Trump revealed his decision during a prison reform event at the White House. Trump previously nominated White House physician Dr. Ronny Jackson for the job, but Jackson withdrew last month. Politico sees Wilkie's path to confirmation as much smoother than Jackson's, though it points out one potential wrinkle: Wilkie was one of three congressional aides present when Trump's campaign supported ditching a provision in the GOP's 2016 platform that called for tough action against Russia.

It was the first time since the 1990s that rhinos had been relocated to the national park, which originally had a population of nearly 2,000, but now has between 10 and 20.

Per the AP, the black rhinos died in what Kenyan conservationist Paula Kahumbu calls \"a complete disaster\" after they were relocated from two locations to Tsavo East National Park last month. Officials suspect salt poisoning as the cause, pointing to higher salinity in water sources in their new home. When the saltier water made the rhinos thirsty, they likely drank even more, possibly leading to their deaths, the country's Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife said in a statement. The rhinos were among 11 moved to the park, and officials said the surviving animals are being closely monitored. The planned relocation of other rhinos to the park has been suspended. As the Guardian notes, the Save the Rhino organization estimates the total world population of black rhinos at around 5,500. The species is targeted by poachers who aim to collect their horns for the black market in Asia. Moving endangered animals from one sanctuary to another is called translocation and is done in hopes of establishing healthy populations in new areas. While deaths can and do occur with such moves, officials say a death rate of this magnitude is uncommon. Kenyan wildlife officials said the results of an investigation into the deaths would be made public as soon as it concludes."

In 2016, he was charged with carrying a gun at Washington's Reagan National Airport. He told Recoil magazine earlier this year that his \"everyday carry\" includes two pistols, a knife, a flashlight, a tourniquet, and a copy of the US Constitution.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 President Trump's deputy assistant was a wanted man during his seven-month stint in the White House, the Guardian reports. A warrant out of Hungary states Sebastian Gorka has been wanted on charges for \"firearm or ammunition abuse\" since September 2016. According to BuzzFeed, the warrant is still active. It's unclear what Gorka did to earn the warrant, though he has boasted in the past of regularly carrying two pistols and was stopped trying to carry a pistol through an airport in 2016. A Hungarian news outlet reports the warrant could be from an incident in 2009. Gorka, a former Breitbart writer, tells the Guardian the warrant is \"more #FAKENEWS.\" On Twitter he responded to coverage of the warrant by saying he moved to the US in 2008. New York notes Gorka didn't necessarily have to be living in Hungary to have been there at some point in 2009. Gorka's actual role at the White House was unclear before he left in August (he claims he resigned, but reports say he was fired by new chief of staff John Kelly). However, it does appear Gorka was wanted by Hungary at the same time he met with that country's foreign minister as a White House adviser, which is, if nothing else, slightly ironic."

North Charleston's city council voted unanimously on Thursday to settle with Walter Scott's family for $6.5 million, the New York Times reports. A city attorney tells the Post and Courier that they're proud they could \"settle a case of this magnitude without a brick being thrown, without a fire being set, and without a lawsuit being filed.\" He says the city took the $6.4 million settlement in the Freddie Gray case and the $5.9 million settlement in the Eric Garner case into account during negotiations. As part of the settlement, Scott's family has agreed not to sue the city or its employees, the Times notes. The city lawyer says that while the payment is large, there was the potential for \"a very large verdict\" if the case went to court because there's video of the shooting and former officer Michael Slager has been charged with murder. \"It's historic,\" an attorney for the Scott family tells the Washington Post. \"It sets a good precedent for a city not tolerating this sort of behavior from police officers.\" Anthony Scott, Walter Scott's brother, says the settlement ensures that Scott's four children will be taken care of financially, and a portion of it will be donated to the Red Cross to help flood victims in the state, the Post and Courier reports. (Slager is in jail awaiting trial for the April 4 shooting, and he says video of the incident doesn't tell the whole story.)"

Three of the patients died at the Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills, and the others died at a nearby hospital, Hollywood police chief Tomas Sanchez told reporters Wednesday. Sanchez said 115 patients were evacuated from the facility after a \"prolonged power failure to the transformer which powered the facility's air-conditioning system as a result of the hurricane,\" Local 10 reports. He said police are conducting a criminal investigation. A rep for Florida Power & Light says parts of the facility were energized by the utility company, the Miami Herald reports. Gov.

At least a dozen other patients at the facility are in emergency care. A hospital rep says most of the victims have been treated for respiratory distress, dehydration, and heat-related issues. \"I kept calling\" to FPL and the nursing home to find out when the AC would be restored, says one woman. \"And I said, 'This is life-threatening.'\" The Rehabilitation Center has been cited for \"substandard or fraudulent operations\" in the past.",

A sixth death was announced in a press release later Wednesday morning. It may have all been due to extreme temperatures at the facility, though the causes of death haven't yet been officially determined. A police rep simply said \"a number of people\" were \"in respiratory distress\" at the facility; 115 people were evacuated from it.

Sanchez says a criminal investigation into the deaths has been opened. The Airstron employee who had been trying to fix the AC unit tells Local 10 that a fuse needed to cool the unit popped out during the hurricane. He says he's been trying to repair the facility's unit for days, but Florida Power & Light (FPL) has yet to fix the fuse for him despite his phone calls. The Washington Post reports a rep for FPL noted the county didn't designate the facility as \"top critical\"\u2014meaning a place given priority attention\u2014during a 2017 hurricane planning meeting. The Post separately reported that as of Wednesday morning some 40% of the state was still without power, and that some may not see it for as long as weeks. The mayor of Naples, Fla., put it bluntly: \"The biggest issue is power.

A number of mysterious cars have been spotted in and around San Francisco with cameras mounted on the roofs of at least two of them, according to the Claycord blog, which has published photos and a video of one of the cars. The cameras appear to be equipped with LIDAR, a technology used by Google, Nokia, and others to map out imagery for Street View. LIDAR has also been used in some adaptive cruise control implementations to monitor distances between vehicles and automatically apply the brakes on a car. The unmarked vehicle was confirmed as having been leased to Apple via its number plate, which \"could indicate that the company is preparing a large update to its maps app for the iPhone and iPad, similar to the street-level photography within Google Maps,\" writes Sam Biddle at the Guardian. Apple's car also includes the same wheel sensor that Navteq used on its Bing cars previously to create street imagery for Microsoft's mapping service. Google Street View was introduced in 2006 across five major US cities before expanding to the rest of the UK and Europe in 2008. It marked the switch for Google from relying on other providers for maps to building its own. A similar project from Apple could boost the accuracy of its map application and bring it up to par with competitors from Google and Nokia's Here maps.",

What's more, CBS San Francisco reports that the vehicle is leased to Apple. Could they be mounting a rival to Google Maps' popular Street View? After all, Apple is planning to release iOS 9 for iPhones and iPads in the summer, and was rather embarrassed by Apple Maps' poor directions and subpar 3D imagery when it first came out. Yet Apple would need a fleet of vehicles to challenge Google's Street View, the Verge notes. Also, technology analyst Rob Enderle says the van has \"too many cameras\" for street-viewing and may in fact be a self-driving vehicle. The van also resembles one seen in a Brooklyn YouTube video that describes it as a \"self-driving car.\" Apple isn't among companies with a permit to test self-driving cars, but the van may be used by an Apple partner who does: \"You know, they have partnerships with a variety of the carmakers,\" says Enderle. \"Just because they\u2019re leasing the car doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s their project.\" Apple has no comment on the high-tech van or vans\u2014so \"it looks like these curious vehicles will remain a mystery for now,\" says the Verge.

Vistara is offering free ground transportation for women flying alone on its domestic flights, as well as window and aisle seats for them on flights to and from the airport, per the Indian Express. \"Our staff is equipped to help women traveling alone with the booking of airport-authorized taxis,\" says Vistara's chief strategy and commercial officer. \"This service is a sincere effort.\" India has been plagued by violence against women since the fatal gang rape of a 23-year-old on a New Delhi bus in 2012. The US State Department warns Americans to avoid traveling alone in the country, while Australia and the UK advise women not to travel alone on public transit. India is fifth on the International Women's Travel Center's list of the most dangerous countries for women travelers, which also includes Brazil, Mexico, Russia, and Saudi Arabia. \"We did find there is a correlation between what happens to local women and women travelers,\" says editor Marta Turnbull. \"There are a lot of activists who are taking it on as an issue. We're optimistic that things will get.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 India has earned a reputation as a place that's dangerous for women and girls, underscored by the story of a 10-year-old rape victim now in the news for trying to get permission to get an abortion. Another shocking story from 2012 set off a series of protests across the country after a young woman was fatally gang-raped on a public bus, and\u2014along with many other high-profile sexual assaults\u2014has prompted countries like the US to caution women not to travel alone in India. Now the Indian airline Vistara has taken matters into its own hands, offering a free service called Woman Flyer, which it describes to Bloomberg as a \"sincere effort to ensure peace of mind of our women customers.\" The free service, which launched in March, is used by between 75 and 100 women every day, according to Vistara. Women who sign up for the service will get help with their bags, be guaranteed a window or aisle seat, and be escorted to a pickup point by airline staff, reports Emirates Woman. While this is thought to be the first airline anywhere to offer this kind of service, Air India began providing female-only rows earlier this year in response to assaults in the air. In 2015, researchers in the UK noted that in places with gender equality, separating women \"reinforces a message that women must be contained and segregated in order to protect them,\" but many who are hailing Vistara's new service says safety comes first.

They then released the bees into an arena where they could observe them pulling strings, and found that novice bees were able to pull a string 10 times faster than experienced bees. \"This is the first time that we've been able to show that a stimulus plays a role in how bumblebees learn to pull,\" says the lead researcher. \"They don't need to pay attention to the object they're trying to pull in order to do so. Instead, they just need to figure out where the string is and where it's going to be pulled from.\" The bees didn't learn the trick by watching other bees pull the strings, but by \"contextually enhancing\" the reward by putting a string in a different part of the Plexiglas table than where they'd seen it during, reports the Washington Post.

But that doesn't mean you can't teach a bee a new trick, as behavioral ecologist Clint Perry tells the paper: \"Bees have some amazing cognitive abilities,\" including counting up to at least four. And now he and colleagues from Queen Mary University of London are reporting in the journal Plos Biology that bees can not only learn an entirely new skill to get food but also pass on their knowledge, which is one of the basic aspects of culture. In their study, researchers placed blue discs with sugar water beneath a clear plastic table, just out of reach, but affixed a string to each one that, if tugged, would move it within reach. Out of 110 bumble bees individually introduced to the task, some tugged at the strings before eventually quitting, and only two sorted out how to pull on the string to get the sugar water. However, when bees got to watch the ones retrieving the sugar water, more than 60% of them were able to pull the string when it was their turn. One of the researchers tells Science that, as exciting as the findings are, the explanation isn't necessarily that bees are smart, but that \"culturelike phenomena might actually be based on relatively simple mechanisms.\" (One type of bumblebee has nearly gone extinct in 20 years.)"

And while brain researcher Rebecca Knickmeyer, who didn't participate in the study but wrote an accompanying editorial, says the variants aren't necessarily predictive and people shouldn't start testing their kids, the research suggests that Alzheimer's may in fact be a developmental disorder, not strictly an aging one, reports the Los Angeles Times. That raises the possibility that adjustments to \"diet or cognitive training\" early on could change someone's \"trajectory,\" per Knickmeyer. Three in four people have at least one copy of e3, which seems to offer a protective effect. About 14% of people have an e4 variant, which has been linked with an elevated risk of Alzheimer's, but Knickmeyer points out that there are many Alzheimer's patients without e4, and many with e4 who never develop Alzheimer's.

But Willow survived, and on May 6, she delivered a girl with heart and lungs strong enough to deliver a lusty cry. Five months later, Willow died. \"She's still the most beautiful girl that I've ever met,\" Mark Sr. wrote on Facebook. \"I'm the luckiest guy in the world to have her as my life and the mother of my three amazing children.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 In May of 2014, Willow Short received a heart transplant when she was just six days old. On Saturday, she was found shot to death along with the rest of her family in what police believe was a murder-suicide. The bodies of Mark Short, 40, Megan Short, 33, and children Willow, 2, Mark Jr., 5, and Lianna, 8, were found in their home in Sinking Spring, Pa., on Saturday afternoon when a relative called police after Megan didn't show up for a lunch date. Cops haven't revealed which parent they believe was responsible for the unfathomable crime, but they say a handwritten suicide note was found in the home and a handgun was found near the body of one of the adults, NBC Philadelphia reports. Police say the couple had \"domestic issues,\" and a friend in the neighborhood tells the Reading Eagle that Megan was planning to leave Mark and had been open about it, posting on Facebook that she needed people to help her move out on Friday. In 2014, the Eagle reported on Willow's struggle to survive her first week of life. In 2015, the Shorts and their struggle to obtain anti-rejection medicine for Willow were featured in a New York Times story. In April, Megan wrote a blog post about dealing with PTSD after Willow's illness, saying she still suffered from anxiety and nightmares and it had taken her two years to realize how badly she had been impacted by the ordeal, the Philadelphia Inquirer reports."

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Target knew about its massive security breach almost two weeks before it did anything about it, according to a new report from Bloomberg Businessweek. The report says that a security firm hired to watch its servers for malware told the retailer on Nov. 30 that someone had hacked the company, but no one acted on it. \"For some reason, Minneapolis didn\u2019t react to the sirens,\" the report says. Months before the hack, Target installed a $1.6 million malware detection tool from FireEye and had security specialists in Bangalore monitor its system at all hours. On Nov. 30, the Bangalore team got an alert and notified Target's security team in its Minneapolis headquarters. For some reasons, however, that team did nothing about an attack that would eventually compromise up to 40 million customers' credit card data. (Target later revealed that personal information like email addresses and phone numbers had been compromised for 70 million customers, meaning a total of 110 million people may have been affected.) The report, which is based on a two-month investigation, contradicts Target\u2019s statements about the incident until now. In a Congressional testimony, the company claims that it only learned of the attack in mid-December, after the US Department of Justice caught it and contacted Target. However, Businessweek cites computer logs that show there were FireEye alerts from November 30 and then Dec. 2, when a second attack occurred. Click for more on the breach.",

Target had plenty of time to react\u2014but did nothing. The $1.6 million software program from security firm FireEye detected the installation of malware on Nov. 30 and multiple times afterward, before hackers started stealing data, but the urgent alerts went unheeded. Why didn't the software kill the malware on its own? \"The system has an option to automatically delete malware as it's detected. But according to two people who audited FireEye's performance after the breach, Target's security team turned that function off,\" says the story, which follows a two-month investigation. \"It's possible that FireEye was still viewed with some skepticism by its minders at the time of the hack ...\" The story points to \"inaction on the part of Target and a clear effort by FireEye to shore up its reputation,\" writes blogger John Biggs at TechCrunch. \"If Target couldn\u2019t be bothered to delete the malware, this piece suggests it\u2019s not FireEye\u2019s fault.\" Click for the full story, which, as Mashable points out, speculates that the mastermind of the Target hack might be a 22-year-old Ukrainian."

That's the biggest decline since the CDC started tracking such things in the 1960s. \"It's good news, but it's not good enough,\" says the lead author of the study. \"We still have a lot of work to do to reduce the incidence.\" The rate among people 75 and older also dropped, from 12.1% to 6.6%. But the rate among those ages 85 to 95 rose from 18.3% to 19.2%. The researchers believe the decline is due to better treatment of risk factors, including obesity, high cholesterol, and diabetes. \"More years of education was associated with a lower risk for dementia,\" the study's lead author says in a press release. \"The fact that our study also shows a decline provides additional evidence that this phenomenon seems to be going on across the United States and not in one particular geographic region.\" More than 28 million baby boomers will develop the disease between now and 2050, and the cost of caring for them will consume nearly 25% of Medicare spending in 2040.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Good news for older Americans: A new study suggests that their odds of getting dementia are shrinking despite predictions to the contrary. While standardized tests showed 11.6% of Americans 65 and older had dementia in 2000, only 8.8% did in 2012, reports NBC News. What's more, people are getting dementia later, with the average age at diagnosis increasing from 80.7 to 82.4 over the same period, reports the New York Times. One possible factor: A person's average education increased during that period from 11.8 years to 12.7 years, say University of Michigan researchers. \"Education might actually change the brain itself,\" lead author Kenneth Langa tells NPR. \"We think that it actually creates more, and more complicated, connections between the nerve cells so that you're able to keep thinking normally later into life.\" Another potential factor: While health ailments linked to dementia such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol increased, people were treating them with better medications. The study draws on long-range data about 20,000 Americans from all kinds of backgrounds, and Langa says it suggests that dire predictions about the nation's dementia problem might have been been overstated. The Alzheimer's Association isn't so sure: Though dementia rates may be falling, \"the total number of Americans with Alzheimer's and other dementias is expected to continue to increase dramatically\" as the number of older adults climbs,\" it says. In the US, the number of people 65 and older is projected to double by 2050, notes NPR. (A game could reduce your dementia risk.)"

Henry, for his part, is tired of hearing about that line of criticism, reports AL.com. \"People make a big deal about these carries,\" he said. \"I mean, I want the ball. I want to play so it's not a big deal to me.\" Stanford's do-it-all running back Christian McCaffrey was the runner-up. Deshaun Watson, quarterback of No. 1 Clemson, finished third. Henry and the Crimson Tide (12-1) play Michigan State in the Cotton Bowl on Dec. 31."

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Harvey Weinstein is out at the company he co-founded. The Weinstein Company's board of directors says the producer, who has been accused of sexual harassment and assault by scores of women, has been fired, the New York Times reports. \"The board determined that Mr. Weinstein's conduct did not meet the high standards the company expects of its leaders,\" the board said in a statement. The firing comes a week after the company said it would seek a court order to force Weinstein to step down from the company. \"We watched the guy for 10 years, and he totally mismanaged the company,\" says board member Tarak Maerov. Maerov and fellow board member Ben Ammar, who was also on the board from 2005 to 2013, say Harvey Weinstein had control of at least six out of nine seats on the company's nine-person board. The lawsuit, which names Weinstein, brother Bob, and three other TWC board members as defendants, accuses the Weinsteins of keeping employees in the dark about \"decades of misconduct\" going back to at least 2005, when Harvey was co-chairman of the company, the Los Angeles Times notes. Meanwhile, Julia Roberts, one of the first high-profile actresses to accuse Weinstein of sexual misconduct, says her career was ruined and she was \"demoralized\" by her encounter with him in a bathtub. \"I stood there frozen, of course. I've since wondered, why would something like that be so frightening?\" she tells Slate. \"It was such a flooding experience. I do know, and I'm ashamed.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Ronan Farrow continues his investigation into Harvey Weinstein's sexual assault and harassment settlements with a new piece in the New Yorker, offering the strongest evidence yet that Weinstein's brother and Weinstein Company partner was in the know. Though Bob Weinstein has denied prior knowledge of allegations from more than 75 women, Farrow reports roughly $600,000 paid to two British accusers 20 years ago came from Bob's personal bank account. Bob, who was operating Disney's Miramax with Harvey at the time, confirms the payment but says he only agreed because Harvey said \"he was fooling around with two women\" who wanted money \"and he didn't want his wife to find out.\" The payment was also hidden from Disney, but Bob says \"there was nothing to indicate any kind of sexual harassment.\" While Bob Weinstein remains as head of the Weinstein Company, a $275 million bid for its assets led by Maria Contreras-Sweet, former head of the US Small Business Administration, would see 51% of the company controlled by women, reports Deadline. Such a change might be necessary, according to the Weinstein Company's remaining board members, financier Tarak Ben Ammar and director Lance Maerov. They tell Fortune Weinstein should've been fired in 2015 for alleged misuse of company funds but was protected by billionaire friends and board members, including James Dolan and Dirk Ziff. That same year, Filipina-Italian model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez says she received a $1 million settlement after Harvey groped her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt, per the New Yorker. Three other accusers discuss allegations of their own, with each other, at Slate."

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 More than 30 years after the world's worst nuclear accident, the Chernobyl exclusion zone still has plenty of wildlife\u2014including wolves, elk, wild boar, and roe deer, LiveScience reports. \"It's very likely that wildlife numbers at Chernobyl are much higher than they were before the accident,\" says a co-author of a new study published in Current Biology. \"This doesn't mean radiation is good for wildlife, just that the effects of human habitation, including hunting, farming, and forestry, are a lot worse.\" The area is now similar to four uncontaminated nature reserves elsewhere in the former Soviet Union, researchers say. Researchers compared four nearby nature reserves that weren't contaminated by the nuclear accident and found no evidence of a decline in wildlife populations after the Chernobyl accident. \"Because it is contaminated land, it is not easy to study wildlife in detail, and any studies are going to have to rely on approaches like this taken here,\" says an Oxford professor of zoology. But \"this study demonstrates that, regardless of potential radiation effects on individual animals, theChernobyl exclusion zone supports a thriving and abundant mammal community despite nearly three decades of chronic radiation exposure.\"",

A new study on animals in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone shows what once looked something like a wasteland is now packed with elk, roe deer, red deer, wild boar, and wolves. Researchers conducted aerial surveys in the zone during winter months between 1987\u2014a year after the Chernobyl disaster\u2014and 1997 and estimated animal populations based on tracks in the snow, reports the Guardian. They found the number of animals in the area was actually on par with those in four uncontaminated nature reserves nearby; but the number of wolves was more than seven times greater than in reserves. The numbers of elk, roe deer, and wild boar also jumped at a time when elk and wild boar populations were sliding elsewhere in the former Soviet Union. \"It's very likely that wildlife numbers at Chernobyl are much higher than they were before the accident,\" a researcher says in a release. \"This doesn't mean radiation is good for wildlife, just that the effects of human habitation, including hunting, farming, and forestry, are a lot worse.\" But another researcher who has studied birds in the zone tells the BBC the research \"only applies to large mammals under hunting pressure, rather than the vast majority of animals\u2014most birds, small mammals, and insects\u2014that are not directly influenced by human habitation.\" And since the study didn't look at radiation exposure, it \"does not address the issue of whether radiation has effects on reproduction, survival, longevity, or general health of the animals surveyed.\" While scientists found Chernobyl's wild boar population dipped in 1993, they say hungry wolves and a disease outbreak were to blame.

Most of the roughly 340 people aboard managed to reach nearby Beacon Island, off Western Australia, with the ship's captain setting off in search of help in a longboat. What happened in July of that year was gruesome: The West Australian reports that more than 120 people, among them women and children, were massacred by a group of mutineers led by undermerchant Jeronimus Cornelisz: Some were felled by musket fire or swords, others poisoned or drowned. Upon the captain's return, Cornelisz and many of his men were executed, reports the BBC. The Batavia's wreck was found in 1963, and a mass grave on the island was uncovered in 1999.

Louisiana so far hasn't had a documented case of Zika contracted locally, though there have been around two dozen cases of travel-related Zika reported there, per the Shreveport Times. But another expert isn't so sure about the Zika risk. Ben Beard, who helps run the CDC's Zika outbreak initiative, concurs there may soon be a proliferation of the blood-hungry mosquitoes in Louisiana due to the massive flooding, but not necessarily of the Zika-carrying kind, as that variety is tinier and therefore more likely to be swept away with the floodwaters. Meanwhile, Zika is already affecting the Bayou State in another way: Per KENS, blood donors are desperately being sought there because locals who've recently traveled to Zika-affected regions can't give blood for about a month after they've come back from their trip, a logistical issue that, along with other factors, has caused a blood shortage in the state.

Though a rep for the European Council president says Italy isn\u2019t on the agenda, other officials privately contradict him. Last Friday saw a 2.45% gap between the yields of Italian and German 10-year bonds\u2014the biggest since the euro began. The Italian yield has hit some 5.27%, just below the 5.5% bankers fear could prompt a widening crisis. Meanwhile, the country\u2019s blue-chip stock market index dropped 3.5%. Investors are worried Silvio Berlusconi may be trying to squeeze out the country\u2019s finance minister, Giulio Tremonti, who has been considered highly effective during the financial crisis and in managing debt. The threat to Italy hasn\u2019t approached the severity of the Greek crisis, but its economy is more than double the size of Greece, Portugal, and Ireland combined, notes the New York Times. \u201cWe can't go on for many more days like Friday,\" a European official tells Reuters. \"We're very worried about Italy.\""

Oh, look at you. Awwww. Aw, he's so. Oh I know. You've never heard a little bad, a little off, language.\" He continued: \"Aren't you just a perfect young man. Give me a break. You know what? It's stuff like that that people.\" Millions of people tuned in to CNN, Fox, and MSNBC on Tuesday night for the 9pm hour likely expecting to hear some candidate speeches. What they got was one candidate talking for 45 minutes: Donald Trump. All three networks stuck with Trump's long press conference even as it veered into sales pitches for his own product lines, despite the fact that Hillary Clinton, who had won the Mississippi primary in a landslide and was neck-and-neck in Michigan, spoke at the same time, Politico reports. They also mostly ignored Bernie Sanders' speech, which occurred in the 8pm hour, and John Kasich's speech, reports Mediaite. \"Trump is catnip to the networks, and they stuck with his rambling, incoherent infomercial,\" Georgetown Institute of Politics director Mo Elle Ellehee tells CNN. \"That's dangerous for his opponents.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 On the heels of his Mississippi and Michigan wins, Donald Trump on Tuesday held a 45-minute press conference from the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Fla., and that was far from the only Trump brand on display. The candidate was last week dinged by Mitt Romney over ventures like Trump University, Trump Airlines, Trump Vodka, Trump Magazine, and Trump Steaks, reports NBC News. (\"A business genius he is not,\" is how Romney put it.) And so Trump did his best to counter that claim, trotting out his steaks (\"if you want to take one we'll charge 50 bucks a steak,\" he said), his magazine (a copy was lobbed into the crowd, notes TPM), his water, and his wine (from the \"largest winery on the East Coast\"). As RealClearPolitics national political reporter, Caitlin Huey-Burns\u2014and many others\u2014put it, \"This is like Trump QVC.\" But not all digs were aimed at Trump. \"I hope the Trump speech lasts another 4 hours and I hope the Cable networks will carry it all, because there is obviously no news judgment,\" former NPR political editor Ken Rudin tweeted, as spotted by Politico. Politico points out that CNN, Fox, and MSNBC carried the entirety of Trump's press conference even though Hillary Clinton and John Kasich spoke during the 9pm ET hour. And as far as mocking goes, Trump didn't just take it, he dished it. At one point, NBC News reporter Peter Alexander asked the candidate about how parents should explain his language to their kids. Trump's reply, per Gawker: \"Oh, you\u2019re so politically correct. You\u2019re so beautiful. Oh, look at you. Awwww. Aw, he\u2019s so. Oh, I know. You\u2019ve never heard a little bad, a little off, language. I know, you\u2019re so perfect. Aren\u2019t you perfect. Aren\u2019t you just a perfect young man. Give me a break. You know what?

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 The FDA is considering dropping marijuana's Schedule I classification, which makes it illegal for anyone with no \"current accepted medical use,\" the Huffington Post reports. The move could make banks less wary of doing business with legal marijuana businesses, and it could also make it easier for medical marijuana patients to get their hands on the drug. Schedule I drugs are reserved for those with the highest potential for abuse. Marijuana has been classified as Schedule I for decades, along with other substances like heroin and LSD. Rescheduling marijuana would not make it legal, but a lower classification could potentially ease restrictions on research into the drug and make banks more wary of offering financial services to state-legal marijuana businesses. It could also allow those businesses to make some traditional. The FDA \"has not approved marijuana as a safe and effective drug for any indication,\" the guidelines state, including glaucoma, AIDS wasting syndrome, neuropathic pain, cancer, multiple sclerosis, chemotherapy-induced nausea, and seizure disorders. But the agency is aware that there is considerable interest in its use to treat a number of medical conditions, including, for example, glaucoma. In Britain, one in four cases of psychosis can be blamed on powerful strains of marijuana, according to a new study. \"Most people who smoke cannabis do it moderately and enjoy it,\" the study's lead author tells Channel 4. \"But if you drink a bottle of vodka each day it won't be good for your health, the same with a large amount of cannabis.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Despite efforts to reclassify marijuana down to a Schedule II (read: less dangerous) drug, there are some people who still insist on its dangers\u2014and new research may back those theories up. Scientists at King's College London have discovered that smoking potent, or \"skunklike,\" cannabis was tied to almost a quarter of all new psychosis cases they studied, the BBC reports. The study published in the Lancet compared 410 patients between the ages of 18 and 65 who had experienced \"first-episode psychosis\" with 370 healthy patients. The results suggest that the development of psychosis\u2014i.e., delusions and hallucinations\u2014is three times greater for skunk smokers than for nonusers, and up to five times higher if they smoked it every day. Hashish, a milder form of cannabis that contains much less THC than the skunk variety, isn't linked to any increased risk for psychosis. English experts say that skunk cannabis is widespread, with one doctor telling the BBC, \"In London, it's very difficult to find anything else.\" Anecdotal stories that back up the study's warnings are worrisome. One woman tells the BBC that, after smoking skunk pot, she \"went from someone who had never experienced any mental health issues whatsoever to an absolute wreck.\" A recovering addict who's now a drug counselor tells Sky News that skunk is the \"Incredible Hulk of cannabis [and is] absolutely decimating young people's lives.\" Still, despite the warnings, study researchers point out that, according to a 2010 study in the Lancet, the three most harmful drugs are alcohol, crack cocaine, and heroin; cannabis falls at No. 8, notes Channel 4 News.

For decades, physics students have been asked to calculate that time and have been taught that the correct answer is 42 minutes. Now, a more realistic analysis has lopped 4 minutes off that estimate. \"This is the kind of paper we love,\" says David Jackson, editor of the American Journal of Physics. The new calculation, which appears in the March issue of the journal, doesn't merely add more detail about the structure of Earth. It also explains why you can replace one overly simple assumption with another equally crude one and still get a much more accurate answer. \"That's what makes this so much fun to think about,\" Jackson says. The gravity tunnel problem is a staple of introductory physics courses because it simultaneously demonstrates both striking features of Isaac Newton's law of gravity and a common but very important type of cyclical motion. To solve it, students must calculate how the force of gravity on an object changes as the thing falls through the tunnel. Students assume that, like a billiard ball, Earth has the same density throughout: roughly 5500 kilograms per cubic meter. In that case, the strength of the gravitational force pulling you toward Earth's center varies in proportion to the distance from. Alexander Klotz's paper argues that the Earth is a lot denser at the center than at the crust, which would affect a person's fall. If gravity were to be at a surface level constant throughout the trip, it would take just 38 minutes.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It's a common hypothetical in physics classrooms: How long would it take to fall through a tunnel from one side of the Earth to the other? The new answer: 38 minutes and 11 seconds, reports Science. The result is courtesy of McGill University graduate student Alexander Klotz, whose calculations take four minutes off the previously accepted answer and appear in the American Journal of Physics. The reason for the shorter time? Unlike previous calculations, Klotz's take into account that the Earth's layers have different densities, and those differences would affect the hypothetical falling man, notes Phys.org. \"The way the Earth is structured, the gravity increases slightly as you go deeper towards the dense core, to about 110% of its surface value, before getting weaker as you move through the core, reaching zero at the center,\u201d says Klotz, as quoted in Forbes. (If it's all a little too hypothetical, try physics-inspired pasta instead.)"
