    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Scientists say they've made a \"landmark\" breakthrough in the fight against Alzheimer's disease with an experimental drug that appears to slow the disease's progress in mice, the Guardian reports. Researchers at Lancaster University in the UK found that a specific protein in the brains of mice caused the disease to slow down. The drug, called d-amyloid- peptide, was able to reduce the protein's levels in the mice's brains. \"This finding, I suspect, will be judged by history as a turning point in the search for medicines to control and prevent Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\" says a professor of neuroscience at Lancaster. Five weeks after treatment, one group of mice remained free of symptoms such as memory loss, impaired reflexes, and limb dragging. They also lived longer than untreated animals with the same brain disease. But the study, published in Science Translational Medicine, is only in its early stages and it could be a decade or more before the drug is ready for human trials. Researchers say the drug, which is still in the early stages of development, would need to be tested on people with other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's. \"It's the first time a substance has been given to mice that prevents brain disease,\" the lead researcher tells the Independent. \"We can go forward and develop better molecules and I can't see why preventing this process should only be restricted to mice. I think this probably will translate into other mammalian brains.\"",

Neurodegenerative diseases halt the production of key proteins, which in turn results in the unprotected brain cells dying off, and symptoms appearing. The compound blocks the faulty brain signal that causes the initial \"shutdown,\" thus basically flipping the switch from \"off\" back to \"on.\" Proteins are produced, brain cells are protected, and symptoms are reversed. The mice in the study had prion disease, which is similar to a human neurodegenerative disorder. After receiving the compound, memory loss and other symptoms including impaired reflexes and limb dragging were reversed; the treated mice also lived longer than those who didn't receive the compound, Sky News reports. Though it's still a long way off, scientists think a treatment based on these findings could also help people with Parkinson's disease. Now the bad news: The mice did suffer side effects, including weight loss and diabetes.

Survivors of clergy abuse say the delay in revealing the allegations is outrageous. \"Why would Bishop Burns suppress this crucial information?\" the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests says in a statement. \"What about concern for the safety of children and the need to comfort any survivors.\" Dallas BishopAccountability.org is out with a list of more than 300 \"predator priests\" it says have been named in the Pennsylvania report.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The Catholic Church has hired two private investigators to track down a former Dallas priest who disappeared months before sexual abuse allegations against him surfaced. Pastor at St. Cecilia Catholic Church in Oak Cliff for 27 years, Rev. Edmundo Paredes stands accused of molesting three boys in their midteens between 10 and 20 years ago, though the exact period is being withheld to protect the victims\u2019 identities, reports the Dallas Morning News. Paredes, 69, was removed from St. Cecilia in June 2017 after allegedly stealing $60,000 to $80,000 in cash. This February, church officials also learned of sexual abuse allegations, which were reported to police and found to be credible, Bishop Edward Burns told parishioners on Sunday. \"I recognize this diocese cannot cover its ears, its eyes, its mouth. We need to look at this head on,\" Burns said. Still, the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests questions the delay in releasing the information. Officials initially said the allegations weren\u2019t disclosed earlier because of a police investigation. Late Monday, however, the Diocese of Dallas said a Pennsylvania grand jury report describing more than 1,000 victims of abuse by clergy since the 1940s had motivated the disclosure after victims objected to an announcement in March, per Fox 4. Officials suspect Paredes is in his native Philippines, which he visited annually, per WFAA. Per the Morning News, authorities there say they are unaware of his location."

Here's what people are saying: At the Daily Beast, Elie Mystal calls the retirement \"a good moment to step back and realize just how broken the process for selecting Supreme Court justices now is.\" In 2016, Senate Republicans responded to Antonin Scalia's death by inventing and establishing the absurd faux principle that open seats on the court cannot be filled in an election year. Given that America hosts national elections one out of every two years, that means, in theory, that Supreme Court seats should remain unfilled fully 50% of the time. In response, Senate Republicans eliminated the filibuster on Supreme Court nominations. \"What we are seeing here is a case of what the political scientist Steven Smith calls 'Senate syndrome': One side breaks a norm or rule, then the other side breaks another in response, and the tit-for-tat escalates until the underlying process is in ruins,\" writes Mystal. \"The minority party no longer holds a scintilla of power\u2014President Trump has until the end of the month to choose a Supreme Court nominee to replace Anthony Kennedy, andthe process could drag on for months.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The fallout from Anthony Kennedy's bombshell decision to retire from the Supreme Court continues to resonate, with President Trump saying he's \"honored\" that Kennedy has given him an opportunity to pick a successor. Of course, getting him confirmed is another issue, and the Hill digs into the political logistics in the Senate. Republicans have the numbers, but two wild cards are Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, both of whom support abortion rights and will likely have a big say in who comes next. A remedy: At Vox, Ezra Klein writes that both parties are guilty of turning the nomination process into an \"insane\" one, given the stakes. At this point, if one party held the White House and the other the Senate, it's unlikely any nominee would be confirmed. His solution? Reduce the stakes by limiting justices to 10-year terms. A big percentage: The Washington Post picks out five times Kennedy cast the deciding vote on big issues, on everything from backing abortion rights to supporting gay rights to curtailing the death penalty. The story notes that of the 276 majority opinions written by Kennedy, 92 came in 5-4 decisions."

Bush administration, and only firms in that pool were later allowed to bid for the Affordable Care Act work. \"There was very great time pressure,\" says a former CMS official. \"The feeling was we had a lot of big IT powerhouses and they knew our work.\" But the Times found that CGI's track record was dysfunctional. \"Should CMS have recognized that 'Okay, here's CGI Federal. It's a new,'\" asks one former official.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It turns out there were even more reasons the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services shouldn't have picked the free-wheeling and allegedly shady CGI Federal to build HealthCare.gov. When CGI was vetted back in 2007, it didn't have any obvious black marks on its record, the Washington Post explains. But CGI is a \"roll-up\" company formed by acquiring other companies\u2014one of which, American Management Systems, was one giant black mark. AMS projects have hit trouble in at least 12 states as well as at the federal level, including a much-publicized 2001 failure to automate federal retirement benefits. The company went $60 million over budget on that one, yet produced nothing useful. More than 100 AMS alumni are now CGI executives or consultants. \"Should CMS have recognized that \u2018OK, here\u2019s CGI Federal. It\u2019s a new company, but, oh, my God, it looks a lot like the AMS from yesterday\u2019?\" asked one ex-CMS official. \"Yes. I would consider that dropping the ball.\" But it didn't come up in 2007, and CMS never re-vetted the company, the Post's review of internal documents reveals. On the bright side, the review also reveals that the decision was politics-free, made purely because officials considered CMS' bid \"technically superior.\" Vanity Fair, meanwhile, has an in-depth piece today on what many suspect is an accounting scandal brewing at CGI. It looks a lot like the company is using its acquisitions to mask financial problems, a quasi-legal practice known as creating a \"cookie jar.\""

Daniel and Royal give their reasons: Women are usually convicted of violent crimes against people close to them (like a husband or son) so DNA evidence won't help; the suspect's DNA is already spread around the crime scene. By contrast, men usually assault or kill strangers. An incredible 63% of women's exoneration cases turn out to be accidents or suicides rather than crimes. So instead of finding a \"real culprit,\" Daniel and Royal may have to laboriously dismantle the prosecutors' case, perhaps with new science on arson or shaken-baby syndrome that not everyone accepts. Sexist stereotypes are used against women in court. In the case of a woman wrongfully convicted of murdering her son, the prosecutor implied she did it to pursue a modeling career. \"That was based on one tiny conversation expressing slight interest in maybe having a nice photo taken,\" says Daniel. \"Almost every case has something like this.\" Click for Mother Jones' full article."

But at the BBC, a review of existing research on the topic suggests the drinks' variety itself isn't the problem. Instead, Claudia Hammond points to other possible factors. For instance, she notes, having several different types of drinks may simply mean drinking more total alcohol. (As for \"beer before liquor, never been sicker\"? It appears no research has been done to prove or disprove the idea that drink order makes a difference.) \"The existing evidence suggests that hangovers can't be blamed on mixing drinks,\" Hammond writes. But the amount of alcohol may not be the only culprit: Congeners, the non-ethanol products of the fermentation process, also contribute to a hangover. Tannins, for instance, are responsible for the color in darker types of alcohol. There are 37 times more congeners in bourbon than in vodka, and one study found that bourbon drinkers reported worse hangovers than those who drank vodka. So, Hammond writes, people having various types of drinks in a single night may end up indulging in drinks with more tannins. So go ahead and mix types of alcohol if you so desire, but you may want to avoid mixing alcohol with cigarettes: A study last month found that people who smoke and drink are at a higher risk of developing esophageal cancer, Science Daily reported.

They found that babies cry for an average of two hours per day in the initial two weeks, peaks at two hours 15 minutes at six weeks, and reduces to one hour 10 minutes by week 12. But some babies cry as little as 30 minutes per day, and others as much as five hours, per the study.

Denmark, Germany, and Japan, however, had the lowest rates of colic. \"Babies are already very different in how much they cry,\" says researcher Dieter Wolke. \"We may learn more from looking at cultures where there is less crying and whether this may be due to parenting or other factors relating to pregnancy.\"",

Lead researcher Dieter Wolke says parents in countries with low colic scores are less likely to intervene when baby starts crying, allowing the infant to self-soothe. \"They don\u2019t get all worried about it,\" Wolke tells the Telegraph. Then again, he notes, Danish babies may enjoy a bit of \"genetic bias\" since their country consistently ranks at the top of wellness surveys.

It's not clear exactly what happened: According to MyFox DFW, the family says Mackenzie's primary parachute didn't open properly (it was supposed to open automatically) and may have gotten tangled, and Mackenzie couldn't open the emergency chute. Mackenzie's dad (who says the main chute only half-opened, according to CNN) blames Pegasus Air Sports Center, claiming it offered inadequate training and didn't properly maintain its equipment. The owner of Pegasus, however, blames Mackenzie and denies any problem with her equipment: \"She didn't do what she was supposed to do,\" he says, though it's not clear what she did wrong; the owner says she didn't take a \"corrective counter action\" to make her parachute \"stop turning.\" He claims the chute did open fully but somehow, \"maybe ... initiated by her,\" started a rotation that caused the problem. The family has hired a lawyer, Fox News Insider reports."

According to court documents, Thicke left Callau 25% of his personal effects, 40% of his remaining estate, a $500,000 life insurance policy, and said she could live at his ranch. Callau, who wed Thicke in 2005, also wants more because she says she gave up her career to help raise Alan's youngest son, Carter. The Thicke sons want a judge to enforce their dad's will and prenup. Thicke died suddenly in December at the age of 69.

Thicke left much of his estate to his three children, but Callau still inherited a significant amount (the Hollywood Reporter has the exact breakdown) and was allowed to continue living on his Carpinteria, Calif., ranch. Thicke's sons say their father acquired most of his wealth before meeting Callau, and that she signed a prenup prior to marrying Thicke. They also say she had no issues with the prenup or the estate plan the last time Thicke updated his trust, in February 2016. (He died in December.) But now, Thicke's sons claim, Callau is claiming the prenup is invalid and there are problems with the trust. Per a petition the brothers filed in a Los Angeles court this week, the brothers say Callau also claims she has community rights to more of Thicke's assets, she should be reimbursed for any improvements she makes to the ranch while living there, and that she took a step back from her own career to support Thicke and help raise his youngest son. The brothers' attorney says in the filing that Callau has \"threatened to make her claims fodder for 'tabloid publicity' unless the Co-Trustees agreed to participate in a mediation and succumb to her demands,\" leading the brothers to ask a court to enforce the prenup and Thicke's will, TMZ reports.

In fact, the name is so heavily African-American that many present-day Washingtons are \"surprised to learn\" that white Washingtons exist, a researcher tells the AP. The story of how Washington became the \"blackest name\" begins with slavery and takes a sharp turn after the Civil War, when all blacks were allowed the dignity of a surname. By choosing the name, he says, Reconstruction-era blacks might have been showing pride in the nation's. When the Census Bureau released a list of the 1,000 most common surnames in the country in 2000, it listed Washington as 138th because most of those names were given to black people. Today, Washington is listed as the No. 1 name among blacks, even though it's not 100% black, the AP reports. \"It's an assumption that the surname is tied to George,\" says an expert on black genealogy. \"There is no direct evidence.\" The reason might have something to do with George Washington, who freed his slaves. \"Many of the big planters continued to be extremely powerful figures in their regions, so there was an advantage for a freed person to keep.\"",

It could be that blacks chose the name to honor George himself, an odd prospect when you consider that the first US president, while opposed to slavery on paper, owned 124 slaves and worked them hard. But perhaps not so odd when you realize that Washington also freed all 124 of those slaves upon his and his wife\u2019s deaths; of the eight American presidents who owned slaves while in office, he was the only one to do so. Some of his former slaves may have chosen to take his surname as a mark of their community; others may have wanted to maintain a link to a powerful family after being freed. Or the choice could have been random: Booker T. Washington, for example, has never said why he chose his last name 60 years or so after George Washington\u2019s death. Some may even have picked the name to signal their devotion to their new country: \"There was a lot more consciousness and pride in American history among African-Americans and enslaved African-Americans than a lot of people give them credit for,\u201d says one professor and author.

In one reveal that may insult art lovers everywhere, Durham notes he didn't run off with the Van Goghs because of any particular love for the great master, or for art in general: He did it because it was an opportunity for a big get. \"That's the eye of a burglar,\" he says. Per NLTimes.com, Durham told a Dutch paper over the weekend he'd wanted to steal two other Van Gogh paintings\u2014Sunflowers and The Potato Eaters\u2014but one was too big to slip out and the other was under heavy security, so he and partner Henk Bieslijn settled on the other two. The Times notes the Van Gogh Museum is still \"furious\" with Durham, who didn't get paid for the film, and refused to help Verweij. The filmmaker defends his choice of cinematic subject, noting, \"You never see documentaries or articles about art theft from the perspective of the thief.\" (The Van Gogh Museum was pretty stoked when the paintings were recovered.)"

According to CBS San Francisco, the floods also swept gold out of abandoned mines and washed it downriver. While KCRA reports that gold can simply be picked off the ground following major flooding, the best prospecting will come in the summer months when the water has receded. Right now, rivers are still high and government workers are trying to keep would-be prospectors away while they get things under control. But in the summer\u2014which experts say could be the busiest since the one that followed major flooding in 1997\u2014stream beds will be exposed for better gold hunting. \"I'm going to have a ball,\" one prospector tells the Chico newspaper.

Here's what they're saying: Republicans are expected to pick up seats in Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, and New Hampshire, while Democrats are likely to lose seats in Iowa, Nevada, North Carolina, and Indiana. Republicans are \"starting from a defensive crouch\" and won't be able to hang on to a majority for more than two years, Politico reports. Barack Obama is on track to have the worst midterm results of any two-term president since Harry Truman, writes Stuart Rothenberg at Roll Call. Obama's party is expected to lose between five and 12 House seats, which would put the total number of seats the Democrats would lose in the midterms at 68 to 75. Truman lost 83 House seats in his two midterms in 1946 and 1950, while Dwight Eisenhower lost a combined 66 in the 1954 and 1958 midterms, according to the Cook Political Report. Most recently, Republicans lost 30 seats in George W. Bush's second midterm and 31 in Ronald Reagan's first. \"Are the Democrats' losses due to the increasingly partisan nature of our elections and the makeup of the past two Senate classes, or is the president at least partially to blame because he failed to show leadership on key issues and never successfully moved to the political center?\" asks Rothenberg. \"The leftward-tilting map means a GOP-controlled Senate could be short-lived if the party prevails on Tuesday.\" Nate Silver predicts a \"battle for the soul\" in the National Journal.",

No president has lost as many in back-to-back midterms since Harry Truman lost 83 in 1946 and 1950, writes Stuart Rothenberg. Dwight Eisenhower managed to lose a total of 66, but Obama seems on track to top him. More typical is the pattern of Bill Clinton, who lost 54 in 1994 but bounced back with a gain of five in 1998. Still, if Tuesday is shaping up to be a night of celebration for the GOP, Politico offers a reality check, at least in the Senate: Several first-term Republicans in vulnerable states will be up for re-election in 2016.

The research, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is part of a larger effort to unravel the mysteries of the evolutionary tree of life. In other words, it's a look at the evolution of life as we know it. As the New York Times explains, scientists have long known that mammals were born into the world, but they didn't know when\u2014or how\u2014they were born. This study, however, is the first to show that the birth of mammals actually began about 66 million years ago. The origins of the placental order, which includes mammals like mammals and birds, have long been a mystery. Protungulatum donnae is the most common ancestor of mammals, and is believed to have given rise to some 5,400 living species, including shrews, bats, whales, cats, dogs, and, of course, humans. Researchers say the animal's arrival on the scene came about 400,000 years after the end of the Cretaceous Period, during which all non-avian dinosaurs died, and 36 million years later than had been estimated based on genetic data alone. \"The findings were not a total surprise,\" one researcher tells the Times. \"But it\u2019s an important discovery because it relies on lots of information from fossils and also molecular data.

The study examined 83 mammals and fossils for more than 4,500 traits, creating a database 10 times larger than any previous database.

The rat poison, brodifacoum, prevents blood clotting, and officials believe it was mixed with the synthetic marijuana. The synthetic cannabinoids are sprayed on dried plant material to be used in vaporizing devices. They are sold under many names, including herbal or liquid incense. \"If you have purchased any of these products, and start experiencing severe, unexplained bleeding or bruising, please have someone take you to the hospital immediately or call 911,\" the state health department says. \"Do not walk or drive yourself. Tell your health care providers about the possible link between your symptoms and synthetic cannabinoid use.\" The outbreak, which began last month, has sickened at least 38 people and killed two. On Tuesday, the Illinois Department of Public Health announced a donation of nearly 800,000 vitamin K tablets to be given to victims. Vitamin K pills are followed by intravenous transfusions of the blood-clotting medication. \"The bottom line ... Efforts to liken synthetic cannabinoids to the active ingredient in marijuana ... are misleading misnomers,\" the department tweeted. \"These ' products' contain many highly potent, dangerous chemicals and you are taking big risks when using them.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Another person in Illinois has died after using synthetic marijuana, reports the Chicago Tribune. The central Illinois woman, who was in her 30s, is the fourth person to die in the state after apparent use of the tainted substance. She's the third central Illinois victim; the fourth was from Chicago. In the last few weeks, more than 150 people across 13 counties have been hospitalized after using synthetic pot laced with what health officials believe to be a type of a rat poison known as brodifacoum, a powerful anti-coagulant. A widely used pesticide, when ingested by humans brodifacoum can cause bleeding from the nose or gums, as well as internal bleeding. Symptoms include coughing up blood and bloody urine, health officials say, and brodifacoum poisoning can be treated with vitamin K administered via IV to stabilize the blood\u2019s clotting ability. The treatment is effective if initiated before excessive bleeding occurs, per the American Council on Science and Health. CNN reports health officials urge anyone who has a reaction to synthetic marijuana to call 911 or go to an emergency room."

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Six Baltimore police officers charged in the death of Freddie Gray will be tried separately from each other, a judge ruled Wednesday. The officers face charges including murder, assault, and misconduct in office, and the judge said trying them together would be \"in the interest of justice\" because some of the evidence against one officer could be used against another, the Baltimore Sun reports. Dozens of protesters gathered outside the courtroom after the ruling. \"It's a step in the right direction,\" a 23-year-old East Baltimore resident who said he knew Gray tells the Washington Post. \"I am here for Justice for Mr. Gray.\" The judge also dismissed charges against the driver of the police van in which Gray was injured. Lawyers for the officers\u2014who have waived their rights to attend Wednesday's hearing\u2014argued that the evidenceagainst them is too \"mutually admissible\" to try them separately, and they fear statements made by the officers could incriminate each other. \"The unnecessary name calling and over-the-top rhetoric to which this court has been required to wade in order to get to the heart of the legal issues in this case is remarkable,\" Baltimore Circuit Court Judge Barry Williams said.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Written motions finally evolved into verbal arguments this morning in Baltimore, where defense attorneys for two of the six officers charged in the arrest and death of Freddie Gray tried to have said charges dismissed and the office of State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby recused from the case\u2014attempts that were both rejected by Judge Barry Williams, the Baltimore Sun reports. The defense attorneys argued, among other things, that Mosby had influenced the jury pool by \"[adopting] and [encouraging] the public's cry of 'no justice, no peace'\" when she publicly announced the charges against the officers in May. Another complaint by the defense: Mosby's judgment was influenced by her husband serving as councilman for a local district that saw a \"disproportionate amount of violence\" in the days after Gray's death, the AP reports. Williams called that assertion \"condescending\" and said while he was \"troubled\" by some of Mosby's comments during her May 1 news conference, the defendants' right to a fair trial wasn't compromised by her statements, per the AP. The hearing is expected to continue this afternoon to determine whether the trial for the six officers should be split up. (In a unrelated story, members of Freddie Gray's family, including Gray himself, were victims of lead poisoning and may have been misled by a settlement company.)"

Farrow was 7 when she said Allen sexually touched her, and a judge later found her claims credible, though Allen has continually denied the allegations, Vulture reports. Sorvino says she was aware of Farrow's claims when she made Mighty Aphrodite but dismissed them \"as an outgrowth of a twisted custody battle\" because of her lifelong love of Allen's work. \"It is difficult to sever ties and denounce your heroes, your benefactors, whom you fondly admired and felt a debt of gratitude toward for your entire career\u2019s existence,\" she writes. Sorvino says her experience opening up to Farrow's brother, reporter Ronan Farrow, about Harvey Weinstein made her want to learn more about Dylan Farrow's allegations, which led to her taking those allegations seriously. Sorvino says her love of Allen's work \"does not excuse my turning a blind eye to your story simply because I wanted desperately for it not to be so.\" She says she won't work with Allen again, writing: \"We are in a day and age when everything must be re-examined. This kind of abuse cannot be allowed to continue. If this means tearing down all the old gods, so be it.\" Sorvino isn't the first actor to denounce Allen. Greta Gerwig and David Krumholtz recently said they regret working with him. And Vanity Fair reports Ellen Page in November called doing an Allen movie \"the biggest regret of my career.\""

She lost a presidential bid in 2012 but has since led the party to regional election victories.

The lawyer, who says the payments were made \"in coordination with, and on behalf of, Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump,\" also says hundreds of thousands of dollars were sent into Cohen's account from companies including Novartis, AT&T, and Korea Aerospace with US government business interests, the AP reports.",

According to financial records reviewed by the New York Times and NBC News, a company linked to a Russian oligarch targeted by US sanctions deposited around $500,000 into an account controlled by Essential Consultants, the shell company Cohen used to pay hush money to Daniels before the 2016 election. Michael Avenatti alleges that funds from oligarch Viktor Vekselberg may have \"replenished the account\" in a series of payments in 2017 after the Daniels settlement, though Columbus Nova, a US affiliate of a Vekselberg company, denies that he was involved in its payments to Trump's personal lawyer, the Washington Post reports. The purpose of the company's payments is unclear. Sources tell CNN that Robert Mueller's investigators have already quizzed Vekselberg about the payments to Cohen's company. Records reviewed by the Times show that around $4.4 million flowed through the Essential Consultants account between its creation weeks before the 2016 election and January this year, including hundreds of thousands of dollars from pharmaceutical firm Novartis, AT&T, and Korea Aerospace. AT&T confirmed the payments late Tuesday, saying Cohen's firm was among those it \"engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration,\" the AP reports. Cohen isn't a registered lobbyist, and while the unusual payments may not have broken any laws, Trump and his attorney \"have a lot of explaining to do,\" Avenatti said in a tweet Tuesday."

Nestle's attempts to trademark the shape of its \"four-fingered\" KitKat have been rejected by the European Court of Justice, which ruled that shape alone isn't enough to recognize it as a KitKat, the BBC reports. The decision was a setback for Nestle\u2014which manages the brand overseas; Hershey is licensed to sell the brand here in the US\u2014and a victory for Cadbury, which was trying to block the trademark. The ruling means that, for now, other candy companies can make similar-looking chocolate bars. Nestle, which reaped more than $60 million a year from 2008 to 2010 in the UK from KitKat, argued that the four-fingered design has become inextricably associated with the KitKat brand over the past eight decades, Bloomberg notes. But Cadbury said the shape wasn't enough to make a consumer automatically think \"KitKat,\" and the court agreed. The BBC even notes that in Norway, a lesser-known chocolate bar called Kvikk Lunsj (\"quick lunch\") has been around for nearly as long as KitKat. The fight between the two confectionary giants is the second major brouhaha they've had in recent years: In 2013, Nestle managed to block Cadbury's attempts to trademark its signature purple-colored chocolate wrappers, per Bloomberg.

They say that they are not punishing him. Of course they are. They are there with him, watching him in his cell,\" Coronel says, per the Los Angeles Times. \"They don't let him sleep. He has no privacy, not even to go to the restroom.\" The Telemundo interview with Coronel was recorded in Mexico in mid-February and aired Sunday night, NBC News reports. Coronel\u2014who married Guzman on her 18th birthday eight years ago, when he was 50\u2014has dual American-Mexican citizenship and gave birth to his twin girls in California in 2011. He is believed to have at least 17 other children. Coronel says she only saw her husband twice during his months as a fugitive last year. \"He just wanted to have a nice time with his daughters,\" she says. \"To be in peace.\" She claims to know little of Guzman's drug empire and says she has never seen him use drugs or violence. \"He is like any other man\u2014of course he is not violent, not rude,\" she says. \"I have never heard him say a bad word. I have never seen him get excited or be upset at anyone.\" (When authorities closed in, Guzman temporarily escaped through a door hidden behind a mirror.)"

    "document": "PAHOA, Hawaii (Reuters) - Residents on the Big Island of Hawaii were alerted on Thursday to rising levels of toxic gas from lava-oozing fissures, and geologists warned that new areas east of the erupting Kilauea volcano may be at risk of molten rock bursting from the ground. \n \n Hawaii County authorities sent a text message to residents of the southeast corner of the island warning them of a wind change that would bring rising levels of sulfur dioxide gas, which can be fatal if inhaled in large ...",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Hawaii's Big Island is on edge as the eruption of the Kilauea volcano, which has destroyed dozens of homes and spewed lava into residential areas, shows no signs of slowing down. The US Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory says new fissures are opening up on the east side of the island and there is a \"decent chance\" more homes will be destroyed, reports the Los Angeles Times. \"Because the lava intrusion is still active and earthquakes are still occurring, we still think there's a decent chance of new eruptive activity at the surface,\" an official with the USGS Hawaii Volcano Observatory tells Reuters. Authorities have removed highly flammable chemicals from a nearby geothermal power plant that was in the path of creeping lava. Workers in Hawaii have moved 50,000 gallons of a flammable gas away from a geothermal plant where lava has oozed from cracks in the ground, the AP reports. The move of pentane from the Puna Geothermal Venture was sped up because of the ongoing lava threat. The flammable gas was moved to an industrial park some 30 miles away, Hawaii County Managing Director Wil Okabe says. The Geothermal Venture sits on the edge of Leilani Estates, one of the areas where nearly 2,000 residents have been forced to evacuate as Kilauea continues to spew lava. Officials say they aren't expecting a possible explosive volcano to be life-threatening as long as people stay out of a surrounding Hawaii national park that's preparing to close.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The ongoing eruption of Hawaii's Kilauea volcano is creating new worries for residents\u2014including the risk of \"vog,\" or volcanic smog. Big Island residents have been warned that a change in the wind is expected to increase the risk of vog, which contains potentially deadly sulfur dioxide gas, Reuters reports. Gov. David Ige has warned that more mass evacuations will be needed as new cracks in the ground send lava and toxic gas into new neighborhoods near the volcano. Ige has asked President Trump to declare a disaster in the state so that federal money can be used in the event of large-scale evacuations by air and sea, the AP reports. Forecasters say Big Island residents are likely to face higher levels of sulfur dioxide Friday, which is especially dangerous for children, the elderly, and those with respiratory conditions, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Trade winds are expected to ease conditions by Saturday morning. Amid fears that the volcano, one of the world's most active, could erupt explosively, flammable pentane has been removed from a geothermal plant near two neighborhoods that had to be evacuated because of lava and gas. Kilauea is surrounded by Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, which closed Thursday night until further notice. Scientists had warned that if the volcano erupts, park visitors within a mile or so of the crater were at risk of being hit by refrigerator-sized boulders."
