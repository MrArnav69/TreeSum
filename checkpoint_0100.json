Republicans currently hold 29 governorships, Democrats have 20, and Rhode Island's Gov. Lincoln Chafee is an Independent. \n \n Polls and race analysts suggest that only three of tonight's contests are considered competitive, all in states where incumbent Democratic governors aren't running again: Montana, New Hampshire and Washington. \n \n While those state races remain too close to call, Republicans are expected to wrest the North Carolina governorship from Democratic control, and to easily win GOP-held seats in Utah, North Dakota and Indiana. \n \n Democrats are likely to hold on to their seats in West Virginia and Missouri, and are expected to notch safe wins in races for seats they hold in Vermont and Delaware. \n \n Holding Sway On Health Care \n \n While the occupant of the governor's office is historically far less important than the party that controls the state legislature, top state officials in coming years are expected to wield significant influence in at least one major area. \n \n And that's health care, says political scientist Thad Kousser, co-author of The Power of American Governors. \n \n \"No matter who wins the presidency, national politics is going to be stalemated on the Affordable Care Act,\" says Kousser, of the University of California, San Diego. \n \n A recent U.S. Supreme Court decision giving states the ability to opt out of the law's expansion of Medicaid, the federal insurance program for poor, disabled and elderly Americans, confers \"incredible power\" on the states and their governors, Kousser says. \n \n Just look at what happened when the Obama administration in 2010 offered federal stimulus money to states to begin building a high-speed rail network. Three Republican governors, including Rick Scott of Florida and Scott Walker of Wisconsin, rejected a share of the money citing debt and deficit concerns. \n \n \"A [Mitt] Romney victory would dramatically empower Republican governors,\" Kousser says. \n \n State-By-State View \n \n North Carolina: One-term incumbent Democratic Gov. Beverly Perdue, the first woman to hold the state's top office, announced in January that she would not seek re-election after polls showed her with high disapproval ratings and trailing Republican candidate Pat McCrory. \n \n The seat is expected to be won by McCrory, a former Charlotte mayor, who is facing Perdue's lieutenant governor, Walter Dalton. McCrory lost a close race to Perdue in 2008, when then-presidential candidate Barack Obama became the first Democrat to win North Carolina in more than three decades. The Real Clear Politics average for the race has McCrory maintaining a 14.3 percentage point lead. \n \n Montana: Popular Democratic Gov. Brian Schweitzer \u2014 he won his last election with 65 percent of the vote \u2014 has reached his two-term limit. The state's Democratic Attorney General Steve Bullock is trying to keep the seat in his party's column by associating himself with Schweitzer's legacy. He's in a tough race with former two-term GOP Rep. Rick Hill. \n \n New Hampshire: Former Democratic state Sen. Maggie Hassan has also promised a continuation of the policies of her predecessor, retiring Democratic Gov. John Lynch. Her opponent is lawyer Ovide Lamontagne, a Tea Party conservative who ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1996 and for the U.S. Senate in 2010. The national parties have invested in the campaigns, which have focused on fiscal and women's health care issues. \n \n Washington: The state's governorship has been in Democratic hands for 32 years, and former U.S. Rep. Jay Inslee is in a dead-heat battle to keep it that way. His opponent is the state's Republican Attorney General Rob McKenna. McKenna has a proven ability to win statewide, but working in Inslee's favor are Obama's poll numbers. The Real Clear Politics average shows Obama with an average 13.6 percentage point lead over Romney; Inslee is leading McKenna by an average of 1 percentage point. \n \n Pretty Much Sure Things \n \n Republican Govs. Jack Dalrymple in North Dakota and Gary Herbert in Utah, and GOP Rep. Mike Pence in Indiana are expected to win. So are Democratic Govs. Peter Shumlin in Vermont and Jack Markell in Delaware. \n \n Democrats are also hoping to hold on to the governorship in Missouri, where Jay Nixon is running for a second term against Republican Dave Spence; and in West Virginia, where Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin, former state senate president, is running for his first full term after winning a special election in 2011. GOP businessman Bill Maloney is his opponent, as he was last year. \n \n Nixon has been consistently outpolling Spence by an average of about 7 points in Missouri. Tomblin is seen as likely to retain his seat, even in a state where Romney is leading Obama by double digits. ||||| GOP Eyes Gains As Voters In 11 States Pick Governors \n \n Jim Cole / AP i Jim Cole / AP \n \n Voters in 11 states will pick their governors tonight, and Republicans appear on track to increase their numbers by at least one, and with the potential to extend their hold to more than two-thirds of the nation's top state offices. \n \n Eight of the gubernatorial seats up for grabs today are now held by Democrats; three are in Republican hands.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It's a race for the governor's mansion in 11 states today, and the GOP could end the night at the helm of more than two-thirds of the 50 states. The GOP currently controls 29 of the country's top state offices; it's expected to keep the three Republican ones that are up for grabs (Utah, North Dakota, and Indiana), and wrest North Carolina from the Dems. That brings its toll to 30, with the potential to take three more, reports NPR. Races in Montana, New Hampshire, and Washington are still too close to call, and in all three, Democrat incumbents aren't seeking reelection. The results could have a big impact on health care, since a Supreme Court ruling grants states the ability to opt out of ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion. \"A Romney victory would dramatically empower Republican governors,\" said one analyst.

    "document": "\n \n \n \n UPDATE: 4/19/2001 Read Richard Metzger: How I, a married, middle-aged man, became an accidental spokesperson for gay rights overnight on Boing Boing \n \n It\u2019s time to clarify a few details about the controversial \u201cHey Facebook what\u2019s SO wrong with a pic of two men kissing?\u201d story, as it now beginning to be reported in the mainstream media, and not always correctly. \n \n First of all, with regards to the picture: \n \n The photo which was used to illustrate my first post about the John Snow Kiss-In is a promotional still from the British soap opera \u201cEastenders.\u201d It features one of the main characters from the show (Christian Clarke, played by the actor John Partridge- left) and someone else who I don\u2019t know. I am not a regular viewer so I can\u2019t say if the man on the right is an extra or an actual character. \n \n This picture has itself caused scandal in the UK, as it was a gay kiss that was broadcast before the watershed, and as such led to a number of complaints to the BBC. However, since this episode aired (October 2008) Christian now has a boyfriend and a few more gay kisses have taken place. \n \n In relation to the John Snow Kiss-In event, I used this particular photo because I considered it to be quite mild (no groping, no tongues). The photos I had considered using before I chose that one are much more racy. Oh the irony! \n \n Secondly, the removal of the Facebook John Snow Kiss-In event: \n \n It turns out that the Facebook event for the John Snow Kiss-In was not blocked by Facebook, but made private by the creator of the event itself. Paul Shetler, the organizer, left this comment on the previous thread: \n \n \u201cHey I just saw this. Before it goes too far, I just want people to know that FB have NOT removed the kiss-in event page; it\u2019s still there, but _I made the event private after the event_ was over and only visible to those who had been invited as there were starting to be trolls posting abusive nonsense on it.\u201d \n \n Thanks for clearing that up, Paul. Now if Facebook will only reply to Richard\u2019s query about why they removed my original post and photo when he put it up on his wall\u2026 \n \n It has been erroneously reported in the media that our own Richard Metzger (who lives in Los Angeles) organized the London \u201cKiss-In\u201d event, which is untrue, and also unfair to Paul Shetler and the actual organizers. Also, Richard did not state in his post that Facebook HAD taken the event page down, he just questioned IF this was the case and IF there was a connection with MY post about the event being removed from his own wall. This seems to have confused some people. \n \n Here is a report on the John Snow Kiss-In from the Guardian, featuring an interview with Mr Shetler: \n \n ||||| || News || \n \n Page 1 of 1 \n \n \n \n \n \n UPDATED: A photo of two men kissing that was posted on a Facebook page protesting a London pub\u2019s decision to eject a same-sex couple for kissing has been removed by the social networking site, an error, according to a rep for the company. \n \n \n \n \"The photo in question does not violate our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities and was removed in error,\" the statement, obtained by America Blog, says. We apologize for the inconvenience\" \n \n \n \n The Dangerous Minds Facebook page was set up to promote a \u201cgay kiss-in\u201d demonstration in London to protest the pub. The page used a photo of two men kissing to promote the event. \n \n According to NYULocal.com, the photo was quickly removed and the following e-mail was sent to administrators of the Facebook page: \u201cShares that contain nudity, or any kind of graphic or sexually suggestive content, are not permitted on Facebook.\u201d \n \n \n \n The decision to remove the photo has prompted scores of people to post their own pictures of same-sex couples kissing in protest \u2014 dozens in the last few hours alone.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It turns out Facebook is only guilty of about half of what it\u2019s been accused of in the gay kiss incident. The social networking site apologized yesterday for taking down an image used to promote a \u201ckiss-in\u201d event in London. \u201cThe photo in question does not violate our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities, and was removed in error,\u201d the site said in a statement, according to the Advocate. But Facebook did not, as has been reported in several places, take down the kiss-in event itself. Here\u2019s what happened: The photo Facebook took down was posted by the Dangerous Minds blog to promote the event. In its initial write-up about the incident, the blog observed that the page organizing the protest had been taken down. But it was actually the organizer himself who \"removed\" the event, Dangerous Minds clarified. Organizer Paul Shetler explains that he decided to switch it from a public event to a private one, as \"there were starting to be trolls posting abusive nonsense on it.\"",

    "document": "It's the Golden State's latest version of the Great Secession. \n \n \n \n Fed up by Sacramento's regulations and Southern California's political sway, residents in one rural Northern California county are taking steps to leave the state. \n \n The Siskiyou County Board of Supervisors voted, 4-1, on Tuesday to pursue seceding from California, the Redding Record Searchlight reported. Proponents say Siskiyou should form a new state -- called Jefferson -- with other counties in Northern California and Southern Oregon they believe share similar interests. \n \n On Tuesday more than 100 people filled the supervisors' chambers, many of whom indicated support for the declaration, the Searchlight reported. When a speaker asked those in the audience who was in favor, \"nearly every hand in the room was raised,\" the newspaper said. \n \n \"Many proposed laws are unconstitutional and deny us our God-given rights,\" said Happy Camp resident Gabe Garrison. \"We need our own state so we can make laws that fit our way of life.\" \n \n \"The state of Jefferson is the place I want to raise my son,\" Kayla Brown said. \n \n Resident complaints include a lack of representation in Sacramento and insufficient attention to major issues for the county, such as water rights and a rural fire prevention fee, the Searchlight reported. \n \n \"We have to have government that's local, understands our issues and has empathy,\" said Mark Baird, a rancher who the Searchlight said was heading the effort. \n \n Supervisor Marcia Armstrong cited restoration of limited government as one of the reasons she supported the declaration. \n \n \"We also have this enormous bureaucracy of unelected officials making decisions for us,\" she said. \n \n Supervisor Ed Valenzuela, who chairs the board, was the only vote against the decision, the Searchlight said. He cited the oath he took upon his reelection to \"uphold the Constitution and uphold the constitution of the state of California.\" \n \n \"I signed on to work within the system I know,\" he said. \"I don't like it, I don't agree with it all the time, but ... I did sign up for that and I will continue to do so.\" \n \n Neighboring counties, which would be invited to join Jefferson, are also weighing secession. Humboldt County Supervisor Rex Bohn told the Times-Standard that his board would probably meet to consider their options. \n \n \"I was one of the people who thinks the state of Jefferson wasn't a bad idea,\" he told the newspaper. \"There has been a total lack of respect of our water rights and the fire fee. Those things may not be important to the rest of the state, but it's important to us.\" \n \n Secession efforts within California date back to the 1800s. The most recent high-profile attempt came in 2011, when Riverside County officials weighed a proposal to pursue the establishment of \"South California,\" which would have seen 13 counties leave the Golden State. \n \n [For the Record, 1:50 p.m. PDT Sept. 4: An earlier version of this post incorrectly attributed Humboldt County Supervisor Rex Bohn's comments on the state of Jefferson to the Redding Record Searchlight. They were made to the Times-Standard.] \n \n ALSO: \n \n Rim fire: Containment of Yosemite-area blaze at 80% \n \n YouTube video shows Long Beach police repeatedly striking suspect \n \n Girl, 7, wounded in car-to-car shooting in Palmdale; three in custody \n \n Twitter: @katemather | Google+ \n \n kate.mather@latimes.com ||||| The Siskiyou County Board of Supervisors voted 4-1 on Tuesday to support the county's split from the state of California. \n \n It's the first in a long series of steps to form the proposed state of Jefferson, which proponents of the effort say would bring representation to rural North State counties that currently are beholden to the whims of representatives of the more heavily populated Southern California and free them from burdensome state regulations. \n \n \u201dWe have to have government that's local, understands our issues and has empathy\u201d for those affected, said Mark Baird, a Scott Valley rancher who's also president for Scott Valley Protect Our Water and vice president of the Siskiyou Water User's Association. \n \n Baird is leading the charge to form a new state from rural counties in Northern California and Southern Oregon, though he certainly wasn't the only voice in support of the move. \n \n More than 100 people packed the supervisors' chambers Tuesday for the discussion on whether the county should issue a declaration that it wants to secede from the state. Nearly all those in attendance appeared to be for the move and about a dozen spoke in support of it. \n \n \u201dMany proposed laws are unconstitutional and deny us our God-given rights,\u201d said Gabe Garrison of Happy Camp. \u201cWe need our own state so we can make laws that fit our way of life.\u201d \n \n Among those in attendance was Erin Ryan, field representative for Rep. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Doug LaMalfa. When asked for the congressman's opinion, she said that she and other LaMalfa staff members supported the effort to secede, but she did not know LaMalfa's thoughts on it. \n \n She also said there's support for the split in Sacramento. \n \n The discussion also attracted members of groups from Shasta and Tehama counties who are looking for their own supervisors to pass similar declarations. \n \n \u201dIt would be the only way I could see everyone coming together in a positive manner,\u201d said Tom Moller of Red Bluff. \n \n Also there was Kayla Brown, a mother in her early 20s, who said she didn't want to raise her child in California. \n \n \u201dThe state of Jefferson is the place I want to raise my son,\u201d she said. \n \n At one point in the meeting a speaker asked for a show of hands from those in attendance who supported the split. Nearly every hand in the room was raised. \n \n And supervisors echoed much of that enthusiasm in their own comments. \n \n \u201dI haven't had one contact in regard to this issue, that's in opposition,\u201d Supervisor Michael Kobseff said. \n \n Supervisor Marcia Armstrong said the issues were about regulation, restriction of rights, lack of representation, regionalism and restoration of limited government. \n \n \u201dWe also have this enormous bureaucracy of unelected officials making decisions for us,\u201d she said. \n \n Board Chair Ed Valenzuela was the sole vote against the declaration. He said he was elected to solve problems within the system. \n \n \u201dIt comes down to because I took an oath. I took an oath when I ran for re-election, which I just did, and that was to uphold the Constitution, and uphold the constitution of the state of California,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd within that, and because knowing what it's like to be a minority, I know the value of having to work from the other side without the numbers and without support. I signed on to do that, I signed on to work within the system I know. I don't like it, I don't agree with it all the time but at the same token, I did sign up for that and I will continue to do so.\u201d \n \n In August, county residents lobbied the board to consider separating from the state over a laundry list of complaints including a lack of representation in Sacramento for the Republican-majority county, issues pertaining to water rights and the rural fire prevention fee. \n \n If the county were to split from the state, any action taken today would be the first step in a long process that would require approval from the state Legislature and the U.S. Congress. \n \n Siskiyou County would also invite other neighboring counties in California and Southern Oregon to join in the effort to create a new state. \n \n The U.S. Constitution allows for the formation of new states, though land can't be taken from existing states without the consent of state and federal governments. \n \n Humboldt County 1st District Supervisor Rex Bohn said he can understand the frustration in Siskiyou County and that he tends to agree with most of the issues that were brought up by the board. \n \n \u201dI was one of the people who thinks the State of Jefferson wasn't a bad idea,\u201d Bohn said. \u201cThere has been a total lack of respect in terms of our water rights and the fire fee. Those things may not be important to the rest of the state, but it's important to us. This is a major thing for everyone that lives rurally.\u201d \n \n Bohn said the problem is that only 16 percent of the state is rural, and decisions in Sacramento are sometimes based on the needs or realities of more urban areas. \n \n \u201dIt's kind of a drastic measure to get someone to listen to you, but I guess they feel like they're not getting heard,\u201d he said. \n \n Bohn added that the Humboldt County supervisors will likely meet to discuss the issue. \n \n Humboldt County 3rd District Supervisor Mark Lovelace said he took the talk of secession as a statement of frustration. \n \n \u201dThere has to be basic economic underpinnings to make a state work,\u201d Lovelace said. \u201cThere is a certain romantic appeal and allure to the state of Jefferson, this entire idea of what could have been, but in reality it would not be good economically.\u201d \n \n He said one of the problems with a rural county seceding is that the tax base starts small. \n \n \u201dSiskiyou is one of the largest counties with one of the smallest populations,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is also full of state roads that they won't be able to maintain, and federal land.\u201d \n \n Times-Standard staff writer Catherine Wong contributed to this report.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Not a big fan of Southern California? Neither is Northern California, apparently. Supervisors in rural Siskiyou County voted 4-1 Tuesday in favor of seceding from the state, reports the Times-Standard. The county thinks state officials in Sacramento are too focused on the big metro areas of the south and thus want to form a state of its own\u2014to be called Jefferson. Supporters want to invite other northern counties, and perhaps a few from Oregon, to join, too, notes the Los Angeles Times. \u201dWe have to have government that's local, understands our issues, and has empathy,\u201d says one local rancher. It's clearly a very long-shot bid, one that would eventually require the blessing of both the state legislature and the US Congress. Still, neighboring Humboldt County is expected to meet soon to consider the idea. (Meanwhile, some counties in Colorado want to form a new state of their own.)",

    "document": "If True, Building Set For Demolition Could Be Manhattan's Oldest October 15, 2013 5:39 PM \n \n Preservationist Adam Woodward discovered a cellar that he believes could be the foundation of the Revolutionary War-era Bull\u2019s Head Tavern. (credit: Adam Woodward) \n \n NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) \u2014 A preservationist says he has found evidence that a Manhattan building is the former site of an 18th-century tavern where George Washington is believed to have enjoyed a celebratory drink during the American Revolution. \n \n If it is indeed the home of the legendary watering hole, the discovery could mean that the building that is perhaps Manhattan\u2019s oldest is slated to demolished. \n \n \u201cAfter the English had marched up the Bowery and out of the city (in 1783), George Washington and Governor (George) Clinton stopped at the Bull\u2019s Head (tavern),\u201d preservationist Adam Woodward told WCBS 880\u2019s Alex Silverman. \n \n play pause Preservationist Believes He's Found Tavern Where George Washington Visited \n \n WCBS 880's Alex Silverman... \n \n \n \n \n \n The building at 50 Bowery, which has had many faces since, is being prepared for demolition so a hotel can be built at the site. Legend had it that \u201cthe Bull\u2019s Head\u2019s structure, cellar, bones\u201d were still inside, Woodward said. \n \n He decided to poke around and, in the basement, Woodward found what he believes are Colonial-era, hand-hewn and hand-planed joists and foundation walls. \n \n \u201cFound myself in what I am pretty certain is the 1750s historic tavern,\u201d he said. \n \n Woodward said he felt compelled to investigate in the building, which once housed a chain drugstore and the Atlantic Garden beer garden, because time was running out. \n \n \u201cI just realized that it would be the last chance to solve one of the great mysteries of New York City history,\u201d he said. \n \n \u201cIt was pretty incredible walking back in time 250 years.\u201d \n \n Historian and author David Freeland told Silverman that the find \u201cwould make it very likely the oldest building remaining in Manhattan.\u201d \n \n That has Woodward hoping city officials will act quickly to preserve the site. \n \n \u201cWhat an incredible opportunity that the city suddenly has for this thing to re-emerge,\u201d he said. \n \n You May Also Be Interested In These Stories ||||| Photo \n \n Maybe George Washington slept there, or maybe he only watered his horse and ordered stronger stuff for himself. Either way, David Freeland sounded excited as he crossed the threshold where a famous Colonial-era tavern, the Bull\u2019s Head, once welcomed thirsty out-of-towners. \n \n \u201cThere are treasures inside,\u201d said Mr. Freeland, an author and a historian who researched the site for a book about a beer garden that later occupied the tavern\u2019s place on the Bowery. \n \n Photo \n \n But all he saw was debris from the building\u2019s most recent life, as a chain drugstore with a Chinese restaurant upstairs. He did not reach the treasures that thrilled local-history aficionados over the weekend \u2014 namely, some old-looking joists and foundation walls in the basement \u2014 because the steps were blocked by rubble. The site is to be cleared for a hotel. \n \n The joists were discovered by a photographer and preservationist, Adam Woodward, who suspects that structural elements of the Colonial-era tavern were used in the construction of the much larger beer hall, the Atlantic Garden. It reigned as \u201cone of the show places of New York\u201d from 1858 on, The New York Times said when it finally shut down in 1911. \n \n But what about the tavern where Washington established his temporary headquarters in November 1783 as the British withdrew? \n \n \u201cThe whole issue of whether the Bull\u2019s Head was buried inside the Atlantic Garden was one of the great mysteries of New York,\u201d Mr. Woodward said. \n \n Until, apparently, the other day, when he got a look inside. He saw iron work from the 19th century and I-beams from later on. And then he saw a stairway to the basement, and headed down. \n \n \u201cAt one point there was a distinct change in the building material, from cinder block to a brick-and-stone foundation wall,\u201d he said. \u201cI followed that wall and found myself at the front of the building, under the sidewalk at the Bowery, and looked up and saw what looked to me like 18th-century hand-hewn and hand-planed joists and beams with extremely wide floorboards right above them.\u201d \n \n He said, \u201cI was thinking, I am standing in the cellar of the Bull\u2019s Head.\u201d \n \n The Bull\u2019s Head opened around 1750 on the fringe of what was a still-young city concentrated below the Bowery. Washington and his troops marched down the Bowery and stopped there in 1783 before making \u201ctheir official entrance into the city proper,\u201d said Kerri Culhane, a historian who wrote the application that won the Bowery a place on the National Register of Historic Places. \n \n The neighborhood \u201cwas a butchers\u2019 district in the 18th century and the 19th century,\u201d Ms. Culhane said. \u201cPeople drove livestock down from the hinterland and the slaughterhouse was behind the Bowery. That\u2019s where the trading took place.\u201d \n \n It was also a home to the ancestors of future V.I.P.\u2019s. \u201cThe Astors started out as butchers,\u201d she said, but began snapping up land. They even owned the Bull\u2019s Head site. \n \n But the tavern closed. Mr. Freeland wrote that the building became a store that sold stoves until the Atlantic Garden opened as a beer garden. \n \n It was a popular gathering place for German immigrants in its early days, and in the 1870s and 1880s, the Atlantic Garden was raided repeatedly for selling beer on Sundays, when the city\u2019s excise laws appeared to forbid that. Mr. Freeland noted that the laws did not mention beer, only \u201cintoxicating liquors or wines.\u201d The Atlantic Garden\u2019s owner got off after one raid because the judge sampled the beer the police had seized and complained it was so watered down that \u201ca man might drink by the gallon without getting drunk.\u201d \n \n Later still, the Atlantic Garden became \u201ca place where Tin Pan Alley songwriters would go to plug their songs,\u201d Mr. Freeland said. One tune that apparently got its start there in the 1890s was \u201cDaisy Bell,\u201d the song that turned the phrase \u201cbicycle built for two\u201d into a catchphrase. \n \n Mr. Woodward said he hoped the demolition for the hotel could be delayed long enough for \u201ca proper archaeological exploration.\u201d (Calls to the owner were not returned on Monday.) \n \n \u201cI can\u2019t think of another lot in Manhattan that has a more important history,\u201d Mr. Woodward said, \u201cand the fact that it might be intact, a couple of feet under the building, is an incredible opportunity to get on archaeological record.\u201d \n \n \n \n ||||| Elected officials and the Landmarks Preservation Commission are both doing their best to launch a thorough investigation of what may very well be the famed 18th century saloon the Bull's Head Tavern, but their options are limited. Photographer Adam Woodward first documented the ancient, hand-planed wood joists and stone foundation in the basement of 50 Bowery last week, and both he and historian David Freeland are convinced that these are the remnants of Bull's Head. If so, this would be the oldest surviving structure in Manhattan by far, and as Woodward puts it, an \"incredible opportunity to get on archaeological record.\" But the fate of the site depends on the current owner, Alex Chu, who is demolishing the site to make way for a new hotel. \n \n The Landmarks Commission tells The Lo-Down that they're \"aware of the situation,\" but \"cannot require the owner to conduct archaeology.\" The best they can do is give the owner a list of good archaeologists. Some elected officials are also getting involved, but again they've got to take it up with Chu first. \n \n \u00b7 Landmarks Commission: No Jurisdiction to Mandate Historic Site Survey at 50 Bowery [TLD] \n \n \u00b7 All Coverage of Bull's Head Tavern [~ENY~]",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 In 1783, after the British soldiers left New York City, George Washington is believed to have stopped for a celebratory drink at the Bull's Head tavern. Now a preservationist thinks he's found the historic site\u2014and if he's right, it could be the oldest building in Manhattan. Adam Woodward had heard that the building at 50 Bowery, currently scheduled to be demolished so a hotel can go up, might have \"the Bull's Head's structure, cellar, bones,\" he tells CBS New York. So he searched the basement, and \"found myself in what I am pretty certain is the 1750s historic tavern,\" he says. Specifically, he found what he thinks are hand-hewn and hand-planed joists and foundation walls from the Colonial era. Since that time, the building has housed a drugstore, a Chinese restaurant, and a beer garden, among other things. Now he's hoping city officials will preserve the site, saying, \"What an incredible opportunity that the city suddenly has for this thing to re-emerge.\" A historian is also convinced it is indeed the old tavern, and investigations have been launched by elected officials and the Landmarks Preservation Commission, Eater NY reports. But ultimately, the commission says, it \"cannot require the owner to conduct archaeology,\" so a lot depends on him. He's apparently not talking yet; the New York Times couldn't get hold of him.",

According to CBS Minnesota, Wendy's employees claim that Eiram Chanel Amir Dixson became argumentative during a drive-thru transaction just after noon Thursday after the woman asked specifically for fresh French fries. Reports don't specify the condition of the fries, or whether she even received them, but do make clear that an argument followed. Employees allege Dixson reached through the drive-thru window and, after an employee threw a soft drink at her, proceeded to spray them with Mace. The restaurant manager was hit directly in the face while two more employees were also in the line of the spray, per the police report. All three employees provided similar accounts of the incident, according to ABC News 5. Dixson is being charged with felony use of tear gas to immobilize. If found guilty, she\u2019ll face a maximum sentence of up to five years in prison and/or a $3,000 to $10,000 fine.

    "document": "The U.S. Census Bureau reported Wednesday that 16 million children living in America received food stamps in 2014, or about one out of every five kids. \n \n Census said that number is up dramatically from 2007, before the Great Recession, when 9 million kids were receiving food stamps, or about one in eight. The data comes from Census\u2019 2014 survey on families. \n \n \u201cThe rate of children living with married parents who receive food stamps has doubled since 2007,\u201d Census said. \n \n The findings are likely to bolster claims from some Republicans that the Obama administration seems to have a goal of putting more people under government aid programs. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich in 2012 called President Barack Obama the \u201cfood stamp president,\u201d which led some to say his comment was racist. \n \n The debate over food stamps has led to a sort of chicken-and-egg argument between Republicans and Democrats. The GOP has said the end of the recession should allow Congress to reduce spending on food stamps. \n \n While Democrats have tried to give President Barack Obama credit for a rebounding economy, they also note that millions of additional people are using food stamps, and that the program should not be cut yet. The total number of people using food stamps has almost doubled since the start of the Great Recession, to nearly 48 million in 2013. \n \n The number finally dipped from that peak in 2014, but just a little, to about 46 million people. \n \n Republicans have tried since 2013 to cut food stamp spending, as part of their overall plan to slow spending and get control of the budget deficit. In 2013, the House voted to cut $39 billion from food stamps over a decade, and almost a year ago, President Barack Obama signed a final deal that will cut just $8.7 billion from the program over ten years. \n \n That cut was estimated to reduce food stamp benefits by about $90 per month for the hundreds of thousands of homes that use them. ||||| WASHINGTON The number of children in the United States relying on food stamps for a meal spiked to 16 million last year, according federal data, signaling a lopsided economic recovery in which lower income families are still lagging behind. \n \n The roughly one in five children who received food stamps in 2014 surpassed pre-recession levels, when one in eight or 9 million children were on food stamps, according to the U.S. Census survey of American families released on Wednesday \n \n Republicans in Congress have sought to cut back on the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program or food stamp program as part of a larger plan to balance the budget. \n \n Early last year lawmakers proposed $40 billion in cuts from the program over 10 years. The final farm bill signed into law trimmed $8.6 billion from the program, eliminating benefits for about 850,000 people, according to estimates by anti-hunger advocates. \n \n Other findings of the survey show a rapidly changing America in which more children are being raised in single-parent homes and more young people are delaying marriage. \n \n Of the 73.7 million children under 18 in the United States, 27 percent were living in single parent homes last year, tripling the 9 percent in 1960. \n \n The number of marriages also dwindled last year with less than half of households in America made up of married couples, compared to three-quarters in 1940, the survey found. \n \n The median age for people first getting married in 2014 was 29 for men and 27 for women up from 24 and 21 respectively in 1947. \n \n (Reporting by Elvina Nawaguna; Editing by Sandra Maler) ||||| The number of children receiving food stamps remains higher than it was before the start of the Great Recession in 2007, according to the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s annual Families and Living Arrangements table package released today. \n \n \n \n The rate of children living with married parents who receive food stamps has doubled since 2007. In 2014, an estimated 16 million children, or about one in five, received food stamp assistance compared with the roughly 9 million children, or one in eight, that received this form of assistance prior to the recession. \n \n \n \n These statistics come from the 2014 Current Population Survey\u2019s Annual Social and Economic Supplement, which has collected statistics on families and living arrangements for more than 60 years. Today\u2019s table package delves into the characteristics of households, including the marital status of the householders and their relationship to the children residing in the household. The historical data on America\u2019s families and living arrangements can be found on census.gov.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 There are roughly 73.7 million kids running around America, and about 16 million, or nearly one in five, of them are doing so fueled by food stamps, according to US Census data out yesterday. That number is particularly alarming when compared to pre-recession levels: In 2007, some 9 million, or one in eight, kids were on food stamps. There are currently about 46 million Americans total on food stamps, down from the 2013 peak of 48 million. The jump signals what Reuters says is a \"lop-sided\" economic recovery that has left low-income people behind, but it also underscores a fundamental partisan divide over social welfare programs. As the Blaze notes, Republicans want to scale back the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program\u2014arguing that the end of the recession should indicate less need\u2014and trimmed $8.6 billion and 850,000 people from its rolls with last year's farm bill. Democrats, meanwhile, argue that it's too soon to scale back the program. Meanwhile, some other highlights from the Census numbers: 27% of children live in single-parent homes, three times the 9% who did in 1960 10% of kids live with a grandparent, 15% have a stay-at-home mom, 0.6% have a stay-at-home dad, and 38% have at least one foreign-born parent 48% of households are made up of married couples, down from 76% in 1940 Americans are continuing to marry later, at a median age of 29 for men and 27 for women; that's up from 24 and 21 in 1947",

    "document": "For members of the deaf community, ordering food or drinks at a drive-thru can be a frustrating, or even impossible, experience. But as one deaf woman recently discovered, Starbucks is trying to make this feature accessible for customers with disabilities -- with the help of a little technology. \n \n On Tuesday, 28-year-old Rebecca King of St. Augustine, Florida, uploaded a video to Facebook which reveals what happened during her visit to a local Starbucks drive-thru. \n \n The video shows King driving up to the ordering kiosk. A woman\u2019s voice emits from the intercom. \n \n \"Hi, welcome to Starbucks,\" the woman says. \"What can we get started for you today?\" \n \n King does not respond and waits in her seat. A few moments later, a Starbucks barista appears on a monitor. \n \n King begins to communicate with the woman using sign language, and the barista signs right back. \n \n \"Starbucks! This is what I\u2019m talking about!\" King wrote in her Facebook post, which has been watched more than 4.9 million times to date. \"Share it away! We can change the world!\" ||||| A new technology is getting a lot of attention \u2014 and for good reason \u2014 at the brand-new Starbucks by the outlet malls in St. Johns County. \n \n A video posted on Facebook shows a customer named Rebecca King using sign language for an order -- and barista, Katie Wyble, quickly signs back. \n \n Wyble says she's had a \"passion for sign language since I first saw a teacher use it when I was in preschool.\" Wyble used a two-way video screen to see King, and the duo quickly completed an order for two coffees. \n \n King's video of the encounter went viral overnight. The video was just posted Tuesday, and it has more than 1 million views and over 65,000 shares. \n \n \u201cShare it away,\" King said on Facebook. \"We can change the world!\u201d \n \n \u201cI think more people need to know about what we\u2019re doing because it moves customer service to a whole new level,\u201d Wyble said. \u201cI hope it helps make more people aware of what they can to do serve others in their communities.\u201d \n \n St. Augustine is known to have a large deaf and blind community. Action News Jax spoke to Professor Tiri Fellows, who is deaf and teaches American Sign Language. She had a translator tell us what she thought about this technology. \n \n \n \n \u201cI think it's awesome because it gives the deaf opportunity to order in a different way through the window,\u201d Dr. Fellows said. \n \n Dr. Fellows says going through a drive-thru without a device like this is such a hassle for the deaf or hearing impaired. \n \n \n \n She says its about time someone created this device to help them. \n \n \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d Dr. Fellows said. \u201cMy friends from Arizona saw that on Facebook, Illinois Texas \u2014 they all reposted that video.\u201d \n \n \n \n Dr. Fellows hopes the video continues to spread on social media so other businesses will want to get the technology as well.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A Florida Starbucks has made it easy for deaf customers to order at the drive-thru\u2014and video of one deaf woman's experience has been viewed more than 6.5 million times since she posted it on Facebook Tuesday. \"Starbucks! This is what I'm talking about!\" wrote Rebecca King. The 28-year-old tells First Coast News she was surprised on Monday when she drove up to the St. Augustine Starbucks ordering window and a barista appeared on a two-way video screen to take her order via sign language. She went back the next day to record video of her doing the same thing. \"It is a big deal to (the) deaf community that Starbucks has one now. Nowhere else has that!\" says King. \"We all want to have that at every drive-thru in the world.\" The barista is 22-year-old Katie Wyble, who tells Action News Jax she's had a \"passion for sign language since I first saw a teacher use it when I was in preschool\"; she continued to study it in grade school, high school, and college. \"I think more people need to know about what we\u2019re doing because it moves customer service to a whole new level,\u201d Wyble adds. \u201cI hope it helps make more people aware of what they can to do serve others in their communities.\" St. Augustine has a large deaf community and the Starbucks in question is brand-new. It's not clear whether other Starbucks locations have the same capability, but the Huffington Post notes that at least two other chains, Culver's and Subway, have installed their own technology to help deaf customers order.",
