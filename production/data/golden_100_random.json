You always have the option to delete your Tweet location history. Learn more ||||| One tweet too many \n \n X marks the spot where Denis Finley, editor of the paper in Bernie Sanders' hometown, screwed up. If Oprah Winfrey was the media's Big Winner for her Golden Globes peroration on sexual harassment, Finley was a (fortunately less-publicized) Big Loser due to ham-handed tweets. \n \n Even the most sober of mainstream media get bollixed up over page views and reader engagement as they seek to be more refined P.T. Barnums of a digital age. Being provocative for provocation's sake is increasingly rationalized as a way to promote your handiwork, no matter how tenuous and fleeting the actual loyalty manifested (perhaps with help from a Drudge Report link) might be. \n \n But, as Finley, executive editor of the Gannett-owned Burlington Free Press, unwittingly reminds us, there's a difference between being responsibly provocative and perhaps tone deaf to your audience \u2014 especially in the digital age. \n \n Vermont plans to join Oregon and Washington, D.C., in offering drivers a third option in listing gender on licenses. So M, F or X. In liberal Burlington, where Sanders was mayor, it's not unpopular. And it just prompted one citizen's tweet, \"This is awesome! // #VT Is One Step Closer To Offering A Third Gender On Driver's Licenses.\" But Finley, who came to the Free Press from Virginia in 2016 after a long stint as Norfolk Virginian-Pilot editor (and, briefly, as publicist for a Norfolk museum), felt compelled to respond: \"Awesome! That makes us one step closer to the apocalypse.\" \n \n If Winfrey played brilliantly to her audience, Finley fumbled in recognizing his. The Vermont online universe is now filled with mostly outrage, and claims of canceling subscriptions. In fact, it was only the third in a succession of curious tweets by Finley. They underscored the tempting perils of journalists, even newsroom bosses, who feel compelled to opine on, well, just about anything.Thus, Finley saw an Associated Press tweet on how fans of Frank Lloyd Wright are seeking to prevent the demolition of a Montana office building designed in 1958. This inspired a response: \"I don't care who designed them, destroy all office buildings.\" \n \n Fine. Chalk that up to lame humor. Then, after word from none other than The New York Times that \"Former President Barack Obama is to be the first guest on David Letterman's new monthly Netflix talk show,\" he sought to exhibit his inner Jimmy Kimmel with this: \"Another reason not to subscribe to Netflix.\" That was lame, with a smidgen of the obtuse. \n \n As outrage quickly manifested itself over the gender matter, Finley seemed to dig a deeper hole. A Tim Sinnott tweeted that the state policy was awesome \"because recognition is awesome\" and Finley responded, \"All recognition? Any recognition, Tim? What if someone said it's awesome they are going to recognize pedophiliacs on licenses? I'm not being snarky, I'm just asking. Not all recognition is awesome.\" \n \n Finley was either high-mindedly engaged in a Socratic inquiry, as if teaching a constitutional law seminar, or manifesting Jonesean (as in Alex Jones, of InfoWars) subtlety cum derision. If I'm a top Gannett official, I might now be wondering if a second bomb cyclone affecting New England is actually on my payroll. \n \n \"So you think trans people are the equivalent of pedophiles?\" Anderson asked. \n \n When tracked down by Vermont's Seven Days about the flap (He declined comment when I contacted him, saying, \"Maybe in a few days\"), Finley said, \"I really just wanted to ask the question: 'Why is that awesome? And why is that necessary?' That\u2019s all, and I think any journalist would ask that question.\" He said use of the word apocalypse was inspired by a Sports Illustrated feature, \"Signs of the Apocalypse.\" \n \n When I passed through Burlington last summer, there were still Sanders T-shirts in store windows. How long before some retail outlets offer a tie-dyed image of Finley with a big, fat \"X\"? \n \n \"Denis Finley doesn't seem to care that, when he enters the arena as executive editor, he carries the reputation of his news organization with him. 'Reader engagement' is not making provocative statements and then picking fights with people who disagree,\" says Tom Kearney, deputy managing editor of the Stowe Reporter, Waterbury Record and News & Citizen of Morrisville, and executive editor of the Shelburne News and The Citizen, which serves Charlotte and Hinesburg. \n \n Then there's Jon Margolis, who was an A-list national political writer during his heyday with The Chicago Tribune. That was a pre-internet world where reporters and editors weren't tweeting their views on everything from whom they'd seen at lunch, a referee's call in the NFL game they were watching or, of course, every breathing moment of Donald Trump. \n \n \"Why this urge to tweet so often?\" asks Margolis, who is retired in South Burlington, a few blocks from the Burlington city line. \"I do not think the world breathlessly awaits my latest witty aphorism or my personal take on what happened today. If I have something to offer that\u2019s worthwhile, I\u2019ll write a piece about it. That means reporting \u2014 online, on the phone, at somebody\u2019s office. And then writing, as well as possible, which means as succinctly as possible but always more than 280 clicks of the keyboard.\" \n \n \n \n \"Tweeting is like artificial turf. The technology makes it possible, not advisable. That would apply even where the tweet is not as aggressively ignorant as Finley\u2019s. But just think: Were he writing an article instead of a blurt (essentially what a tweet is) he might have read it over and then altered (or deep-sixed) it. Or had somebody else edit it, which even the boss should always do. Amazing how the conventional processes of newspapers can save us from ourselves.\" \n \n Jake Tapper vs. Stephen Miller \n \n Jousting between cable TV hosts and guests is now a performance fixture. Bill O'Reilly rode it to riches before his sexual harassment self-immolation. In its most pedestrian post-O'Reilly form, it brings some well intentioned but weak liberal saps served up as red meat for Fox's Tucker Carlson. \n \n In a fairer tussle, it brought us CNN's Jake Tapper and White House aide Stephen Miller. And Tapper giving him the boot. \n \n Tapper is evolving into his network's prime skeptic of all things Trump and, unlike Carlson, not reflexively given to pillorying lightweight guests. And Miller is the unbridled partisan who has reveled in public combat ever since his high school days at a largely liberal Los Angeles high school \n \n As The New York Times' Matt Flegenheimer has put it in a profile of Miller, his life \"is a triumph of unbending convictions and at least occasional contrivance. It is a story of beliefs that congealed early in a home that he helped nudge to the right of its blue-state ZIP code, and of an ideology that became an identity for a spindly agitator at a large and racially divided public high school.\" \n \n \"These formative years supplied the template for the life Mr. Miller has carved out for himself in Washington, where he remains the hard-line jouster many of Mr. Trump\u2019s most zealous supporters trust most in the White House \u2014 and many former peers fear.\" \n \n This all began with the equally pro forma, and dungeon's host salutation, \"Stephen, thanks so much for joining us and happy new year, good to see you.\" \n \n On Sunday, Miller called Michael Wolff the \"garbage author of a garbage book,\" a rather mediocre pre-meditated line for someone of his acerbic and calculating essence. He called Trump a \"political genius.\" He called it a \"work of pure fiction.\" And \"a pile of trash.\" \n \n It was mostly solid, fair-minded inquisition by Tapper for about six minutes, until it first got a tad personal and each started cutting off the other. Miller referred to CNN's Trump coverage as hysterical, and Tapper suggested it was Miller who was being hysterical. As if Miler were a child, Tapper asked him to \"settle down, settle down.\" \n \n At the nine-minute mark, what had seemed a small lull turned sour as Tapper brought up a letter that Miller wrote on the subject of firing then-FBI Director James Comey. Miller stumbled a tad before Tapper broached the president's bizarre Saturday tweet on his own purported genius. \n \n Tapper correctly persisted in broaching the public discourse on Trump's rationality, as Miller sought to divert the topic to his theme of CNN being out of touch with a working America that his boss understands and CNN doesn't. \n \n Then, Tapper had enough. He said that Miller was being \"obsequious,\" playing to an audience of one (Trump) and not answering his question. He simply cut him off. It was rather abrupt and could have been executed in a less peremptory manner. It came off as a host losing control, as much as Trump critics loved the scene and think Miller deserved it. But if you don't want to fight the lions, stay away from their pen. \n \n Regardless, both Miller and Tapper surely came away thinking they'd won (maybe all the more so as Miller was escorted out by security). Predictably, Trump soon tweeted some venom Tapper's way: \"Jake Tapper of Fake News CNN just got destroyed in his interview with Stephen Miller of the Trump Administration. Watch the hatred and unfairness of this CNN flunky!\" \n \n New York Times unveils ad on Golden Globes \n \n Truly salute The New York Times for actually trying to market excellence in a way that's about 20 years late for most of the newspaper industry. It unveiled the next part of its \"The Truth is Hard\" brand campaign during NBC's Golden Globes broadcast. \n \n Similar to its first ad on last year's Oscars, the ad features black type against a white background. \"He said, she said\" are the first words you see. Then they are repeated multiple times until it's just, \"She said, she said, she said, she said,\" with the ad ending \"The truth has power. The truth will not be threatened. The truth has a voice.\" \n \n The \"truth has a voice\" is a simple and potent notion. But, as a TV spot, it falls a bit flat. As one top advertising executive told me, it's unlikely that most viewers connected the paper's incredible sex harassment reporting, including on Harvey Weinstein, and the ad. For those who who did \u2014 the event was filled with unavoidable talk of sex harassment in Hollywood, including Seth Meyers' opening monologue \u2014 the ad was preaching to the choir. \n \n Potency of advertising involves melding the right media and the right audience. In a narrow sense, the Golden Globes might seem a good target \u2014 but only in a narrow sense. The Times has a great narrative to spin as to why it should be trusted, including its admirable attention to fact-checking and precision (even with some hotly disputed cuts in the copy editing force). Perhaps a larger campaign can include such factors. \n \n It's because the challenge for quality media involves more than the mere declaration of virtue. As with changing the attitudes of Americans toward sex harassment, changing attitudes toward even the best of media \u2014 especially when it comes to people paying for content \u2014 will involve a military-like campaign, with no one-size-fits-all-messages and the unavoidable (and very expensive) need to make the case with unprecedented regularity and persistence. \n \n TV news viewing continues to head south, Trump aside \n \n As Poynter reports, \"Until now, local TV news viewership has been declining slowly. But a new Pew research study shows that from 2016 to 2017, the decline picked up speed.\" \n \n Younger Americans' turn from TV news is important. But, somewhere in the mix, is surely ideology, though the study does not point explicitly to what's been previously shown to be the sharp decline in Republicans' confidence in \"mass media.\" \n \n A revealing photo history \n \n The Associated Press put together a gallery of photos of what actresses have tended to wear at the Golden Globe Awards over the years, as opposed to the black dresses they pointedly wore last night. \n \n The morning Babel \n \n CNN opened with Trump defending his mental fitness and, no surprise, a very brief take at colleague Tapper's spat with Miller. It gave rather more time to social media hurrahs about Winfrey's Golden Globes speech and the notion of her running for president. \n \n \"When you think of the Democratic lineup for 2020 ... you pretty quickly run out of star power,\" said Brian Stelter, media reporter cum political analyst. \"If you want to fight fire with fire, Trump is a reality TV star and Oprah Winfrey has been on TV in some ways longer than he has. There are a lot of reasons why this might make sense to Democratic insiders. That speech if anything, gave people more reason to dream it up.\" For sure, there was a smattering of speculation. But, one might hope, it quickly encounters recognition of what's playing out before us: the obvious limits of electing somebody with no experience in the arena. \n \n MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" backed Tapper's performance (\"I would have cut it short after the second answer,\" said Mika Brzezinski) and was the latest to get time with author Michael Wolff. And, before then, there was Axios' Jonathan Swan on what appears to be Trump's shrinking work schedule and also the co-hosts' riff on Trump's insecurity. The latter included the co-hosts venturing into the topic of TV stars, no names mentioned, being self-absorbed (\"We've met a lot of people in television who are narcissistic and stupid,\" Brzezinski said). Hmmm. \n \n But it was a different tone on Trump's favorite morning show, \"Trump & Friends,\" where co-host Brian Kilmeade surfaced at Pancake Pantry in Nashville, Tenn., for breakfast and generally supportive Trump chat. Oh, he was also giving away free to diners copies of new books both by himself and co-host Ainsley Earhardt. Call it a celebration of American commerce. \n \n Sending individuals back to harm \n \n Sarah Stillman, who heads the Global Migration Project at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, has been compiling a database of individuals essentially deported to harm, even death in Central America. With the help of a dozen students, and lots of activists involved in immigrant rights, humanitarian aid and other organizations, she's now uncovered patterns of awful consequences to what can at times seem almost frivolous infractions and, too, insufficient government due diligence and articulation to individuals of their rights. The melancholy bottom line is underscored in this New Yorker piece. \n \n Terrific women in a mostly male soccer universe \n \n Watching loads of English soccer over the past week, I was reminded of the terrific in-studio hosting work of Brit Rebecca Lowe for NBC's fine coverage of Premier League matches, as well as Brit Kate Abdo (who is also fluent in Spanish, German and French) for Fox Sports' solid (not quite as strong and measured as NBC's) coverage of the related FA Cup tournament. The latter is one in which the top rank teams are thrown into a mix with lower division ones in frequent David vs. Goliath contests (often at the very quaint fields of the Davids). Sunday, mighty Arsenal was such a victim. \n \n And yet, they are surrounded by a sea of men, in studio and out, with all the match announcers men and, with a single seeming exception, glimpsed in an Arsenal-Nottingham Forest match yesterday, all the refs and linesman are male (there was a female linesman). \n \n New England hoopla \n \n New England Patriots fans have reason to be suspicious of ESPN, as Boston.com columnist Chad Finn, underscores. An us-versus-the-world mindset is partly fueled by some inaccurate reporting on the Patriots by ESPN. But when it comes to its chronicle of rising tensions among the owner, coach and star quarterback, Finn defends reporter Seth Wickersham \n \n The reflexive doubts are too bad, he writes, since \"if the story is read with clear eyes and all rooting interests aside, it\u2019s far more illuminating than it is salacious.\" \n \n Are we so sure that Mueller is investigating Trump for obstruction? \n \n Writing in the excellent Lawfare blog, Harvard Law's Jack Goldsmith raises the possibility that the seeming lack of recusal by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in the Mueller Russia investigation might suggest that there's not the obstruction investigation that folks assume (speculation fueled further by a Michael Schmidt opus in The New York Times last week). \n \n \"One possibility is that Rosenstein has no conflict because Mueller is not actually investigating the president for obstruction. It has been widely reported for months in multiple reputable outlets that Mueller is conducting such an investigation. Schmidt\u2019s story implies that he is, and reports that Mueller has evidence in his possession that appears relevant only to an obstruction investigation.\" \n \n The reader over your shoulder \n \n There's unavoidable counsel to journalists in a blog in the Paris Review, the literary bastion founded by the late George Plimpton, as Patricia O'Conner an author and former staff writer at The New York Times Book Review, discusses a 1940s work by poet-novelist Robert Graves, \"The Reader Over Your Shoulder: A Handbook for Writers of English Prose.\u201d \n \n The book turned on the notion that writers should imagine a bunch of readers standing over their shoulder, in the process laying out 41 core principles and, then, annealing 50 excerpts of writing from famous authors to school headmasters. Graves was pretty fearless in underscoring lack of clarity. \n \n As O'Conner puts it, \"Those forty-one principles work both ways; they make for better reading as well as better writing. They can show a reader what\u2019s wrong with something that rings false or doesn\u2019t make sense or leaves questions unanswered. In a climate where rumors, impressions, and outright lies are sometimes treated as fact, informed readers are more important than ever. No democracy can afford to be without readers who can ask the right questions, who can critically judge what they read, who can mentally peer over an author\u2019s shoulder.\" \n \n And tonight's big college football championship game \n \n It's Alabama versus Georgia and, reports The Wall Street Journal this morning, \"ESPN, armed with new data about its viewers, is more aggressively selling its female audience, starting with the College Football Playoff, which culminates in Monday\u2019s championship game. The timing couldn\u2019t be better. Advertisers are looking for new ways to reach women, and more efficiently reach broader audiences, as consumer viewing habits change.\" \n \n \"Financial services firm Northwestern Mutual is among the advertisers using college football to reach women and families. The company wasn\u2019t new to the playoff, and knew that the sporting event reached a 'healthy mix of men and women and families,' but a new pitch and compelling data from ESPN helped the company 'come up with different ad spots' targeting women and families, said Aditi Gokhale, Northwestern Mutual\u2019s chief marketing officer.\" \n \n Corrections?

    "summary": "\u2013 Denis Finley has taken to Twitter to call Politico a \"whore,\" sniff about David Letterman's upcoming Netflix show featuring Barack Obama, and call for the destruction of all office buildings, but it was his tweets about a potential change to Vermont's driver's licenses that cost him his job as editor of the Burlington Free Press. The paper reports Finley was fired by honchos at parent company Gannett on Monday evening after he was found to have repeatedly flouted its social media rules. \"We encourage our journalists to engage in a meaningful dialogue on social media, but ... the conversation [should] adhere to our overarching values of fairness, balance, and objectivity,\" says an exec from the USA Today Network, Gannett's main brand.

I didn't feel threatened by him, but I'm concerned that someone like him has that level of influence,\" Morgan said. \"There's got to be a level of discourse that can rise above what happened last night. It was undignified, unedifying.\" \n \n (Also on POLITICO: Alex Jones, creator of 'Deport Piers Morgan' petition, blows up on CNN) \n \n In what Morgan described as a \"big, long rant,\" Jones -- the man who started the White House petition to deport Morgan -- shouted questions about gun control legislation, gave premonitions of a 1776-like rebellion, and pronounced conspiracy theories -- including his belief that 9/11 was an inside job -- while Morgan tried calmly and in vain to conduct a civil interview. \n \n \"Sometimes it's better to let somebody have the rope they need to tie themselves in knots,\" Morgan told POLITICO, noting that he had been far more vocal and more passionate in previous interviews with gun advocates. According to Morgan, Jones continued ranting straight through the commercial break that divided the two-segment interview. \n \n (PHOTOS: Celebrities call for gun control) \n \n Morgan said he anticipated such a performance: \"I knew what we were going to be getting into with him,\" he said. \"I know about his background and his reputation, so I know he's kind of shock jock.\" \n \n But Jones is also influential among conservatives, Morgan said, which is why he had him on CNN. \n \n \"He said last night that his show now airs in 140 networks, he has a huge online presence -- every day his message gets sent out to millions of Americans,\" Morgan said. \"Through vitriol and rhetoric he is able to spur heavy gun sales and ammunition sales.

But that makes him more dangerous. There will be lots of people who follow him avidly who are not so intelligent, who believe everything he says.\" \n \n Morgan added that the petition to deport him was \"not an insignificant issue.\" \n \n \"There is a pattern of British people who espouse peace or want more peace being gagged in this country,\" he said, citing John Lennon and Charlie Chaplin. But Morgan said that Carney's nod to the First Amendment was promising. \n \n \"They were making the point I've been making: You can hardly accuse me of attacking the Second Amendment by attacking the First Amendment,\" he said. \"I am merely representing my opinion, and that is protected.\" \n \n (PHOTOS: Pols speak out on gun control) \n \n Though the media seems to have all but forgotten the gun control debate, and though chances for gun control legislation are starting to look dim, Morgan vowed to continue addressing the issue until government takes action. \n \n \"After every shooting, America goes back to normal. The media come off the story, nothing gets done, the pressure on politicians dissipates,\" he said. \"But you and I both know there's going to be another shooting in months, or even weeks.

    "document": "White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci took a page out of President Trump\u2019s playbook Wednesday night with a tweet threatening to sic the FBI on a supposed information leaker. \u201cIn light of the leak of my financial disclosure info which is a felony. I will be contacting the FBI and the Justice Department,\u201d Scaramucci wrote, inexplicably tagging White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. Scaramucci did not specify what information was leaked, but a Politico article cited the incoming communications director\u2019s required financial disclosure in reporting he earned $4.9 million since last year from his ownership stake in investment firm SkyBridge. Scaramucci appeared to delete the tweet, but in a subsequent post said Priebus was among the senior White House officials helping to crack down on leaks. ||||| The incoming White House communications director earned $4.9 million from his ownership stake in SkyBridge. | Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Scaramucci still stands to profit from SkyBridge from the White House The newly named White House communications director has earned millions from ownership stake since last year, according to his financial disclosure. \n \n Anthony Scaramucci finally has his White House job, but he still stands to profit from an ownership stake in his investment firm SkyBridge Capital. \n \n The incoming White House communications director earned $4.9 million from his ownership stake in SkyBridge in addition to more than $5 million in salary between Jan. 1, 2016, and the end of June, when he joined the Export-Import Bank, according to a financial disclosure filed with the Office of Government Ethics. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n The disclosure form, which is publicly available upon request, hasn\u2019t been previously reported. \n \n The disclosure highlights the extensive wealth Scaramucci has accumulated in his career \u2014 much like many of Trump\u2019s other top advisers and Cabinet secretaries \u2014 and also the challenge he faces in extracting himself from the potential conflicts his investments could pose. \n \n Scaramucci\u2019s financial filing values SkyBridge Capital at more than $50 million and states that he owns nearly 44 percent of the firm. When the sale of the company is completed, expected to be in the third quarter of this year, he will receive \u201cthe agreed-upon purchase price for his share of the sale proceeds,\u201d according to the filing. \n \n Bloomberg valued the Skybridge deal at between $200 million and $230 million when it was announced in January. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s black and white that he\u2019s going to get money,\u201d said Austin Evers, executive director at American Oversight, a watchdog group that focuses on transparency in government. \n \n The SkyBridge website continues to advertise Scaramucci as the firm's managing director, despite the fact that he has been a government employee for more than a month. A SkyBridge spokeswoman said Scaramucci stepped down from the executive post Jan. 17, when the company\u2019s sale was announced. He remained an employee of the firm, collecting a salary, until starting at Ex-Im last month. \n \n The investment firm, which Scaramucci founded in 2005, is in the process of being sold to RON Transatlantic and Chinese conglomerate HNA Group.

    "document": "CLOSE Scientists say they've found archaeological evidence to support rumors they previously were skeptical of: that starving colonists at Jamestown, Virginia, turned to cannibalism to survive. (May 1) AP \n \n Marks of butchery evident on teen's remains discovered at the site. \n \n This August 2012 photo shows four shallow chops to an incomplete skull excavated in Jamestown, Va., by William Kelso of the Jamestown Rediscovery Project. (Photo: Don Hurlbert, Smithsonian) Story Highlights During the 'starving time,' only 60 of 300 colonists survived \n \n Researchers: Skull shows signs of cannibalization \n \n Final blow split the cranium open \n \n WASHINGTON -- Jamestown's colonists resorted to cannibalism during the \"starving time\" winter of 1609-10, archaeologists confirmed Wednesday. \n \n In a briefing at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, archaeologist Doug Owsley presented the reconstructed skull of a 14-year-old English girl, named \"Jane\" by the researchers, discovered at the site of the fort and bearing the marks of butchery. \n \n \"The skull was split in half, most likely with a lightweight ax or quite possibly, a cleaver,\" Owsley said at the briefing. Cut marks crisscrossing the skull and jaw of the girl indicate her flesh, tongue and brains were removed from the skull, Owsley said. Those were traditional cuts for animal butchery of the time, \"all parts of the cuisine of the 17th century,\" he said. \n \n Jamestown was founded in 1607 by English colonists. The starving time was a period two years later in which 80% of the colonists died. Besieged by Powhatan Indians in their wooden fort, the settlers had been joined by new colonists late that summer, among them women and children, whose main supply ship had disappeared in a storm, leaving them without food. Only 60 of 300 people survived the winter. \n \n \"They were so emaciated when they were rescued that they were described as resembling skeletons,\" says historian James Horn of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, who spoke at the briefing. Records kept by the colony's governor, George Percy, make clear references to cannibalism during the winter, Horn says. \"The English would have only resorted to cannibalism under the most severe circumstances,\" he added. \n \n VIDEO: Cannibalism at Jamestown confirmed \n \n Owsley reported on the forensic analysis of 17th century human remains and a reconstruction of her appearance made by forensic scientists. The remains had been excavated by Jamestown archaeologists led by William Kelso of the Jamestown Recovery Project in 2012 as part of a 20-year excavation of the James Fort site. \"We don't believe Jane was a lone case,\" Kelso said. \n \n This April 2013 photo shows a forensic facial reconstruction produced by StudioEIS of Brooklyn, N.Y., in consultation with William Kelso of the Jamestown Rediscovery Project. (Photo: Don Hurlbert, Smithsonian) \n \n \"This is amazingly interesting, but it also confirms stories of cannibalism from the settlers themselves,\" says Charles Mann, author of 1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created. \"Things were indeed terrible during those early years,\" Mann says, by email. \n \n While not all colonial-era historians agreed that cannibalism took place at Jamestown, most modern ones generally credited the accounts (one man was executed for eating his wife) as reliable. Horn and Owsley argued the butchery marks on Jane provide stronger evidence for the practice. \"No one can say with authoritative certainty exactly why this young lady was cut up, but given the context, it looks like butcher's marks,\" Owsley said. \n \n In the briefing, he identified a number of features on the skull and a shin bone that indicated that Jane was cannibalized. Four shallow chops to the forehead were attempted in a first, failed attempt to open the skull. The back of the head was then split open. The final blow split the cranium open. \n \n \"The person doing this was not a very good, or experienced butcher,\" Owsley said. Chop marks on the shin bone resemble more conventional butchers' marks seen on animal bones from the time, indicating that more than one person may have been involved in cannibalizing the girl. She was doubtless one of the newly arrived settlers, though still not definitively identified. An exhibition devoted to the discovery will open this Friday at the Historic Jamestowne site, and her reconstructed face will be displayed at the Smithsonian museum. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/18cNUHU ||||| Douglas Owsley, a physical anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institution, left, and Jamestown archaeologist William Kelso unveil the reconstruction from the remains of \"Jane,\" a 17th-century teenager from Jamestown who researchers believe may have been the victim of cannibalism at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington. \n \n May 1, 2013 Douglas Owsley, a physical anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institution, left, and Jamestown archaeologist William Kelso unveil the reconstruction from the remains of \"Jane,\" a 17th-century teenager from Jamestown who researchers believe may have been the victim of cannibalism at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington.

The next set, after the body was rolled over, was more effective. One cut split the skull all the way to the base. \n \n \u201cThe person is truly figuring it out as they go,\u201d said Douglas Owsley, a physical anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institution. \n \n In the meantime, someone \u2014 perhaps with more experience \u2014 was working on a leg. The tibia bone is broken with a single blow, as one might do in butchering a cow. \n \n That\u2019s one possible version of an event that took place sometime during the winter of 1609-1610 in Jamestown. What\u2019s certain is that some members of that desperate colony resorted to cannibalism to survive. \n \n That cannibalism occurred during the colony\u2019s \u201cstarving time\u201d was never in much doubt. At least a half-dozen accounts, by people who lived through the period or spoke to colonists who did, describe occasional acts of cannibalism that winter. They include reports of corpses being exhumed and eaten, a husband killing his wife and salting her flesh (for which he was executed), and the mysterious disappearance of foraging colonists. \n \n This 14-year old girl was eaten. She has been reconstructed after archaeologists found her bones in Jamestown, Virginia. Her remains show that she died during the \u201cstarving time\u201d period and bare the telltale signs of cannibalism. (The Fold/The Washington Post) \n \n The proof comes in the form of fragments of a skeleton of a girl, about age 14, found in a cellar full of debris in the fort on the James River that sheltered the starving colonists. The skull, lower jaw and leg bone \u2014 all that remain \u2014 have the telltale marks of an ax or cleaver and a knife. \n \n \u201cHistorians have to decide whether this type of thing happened,\u201d said Owsley, who has examined thousands of skeletal remains, both archaeological and forensic. \u201cI think that it did. We didn\u2019t see anybody eat this flesh. But it\u2019s very strong evidence.\u201d \n \n James Horn, head of research at the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation and a historian on the colony, said the discovery \u201cadds a significant confirmation to what was reported to have occurred at Jamestown.\u201d Further, it\u2019s the only physical evidence of cannibalism of Europeans in any New World colony, although, as with Jamestown, there are written accounts of the practice in others. \n \n \u201cI tend to be sparing in the use of words like \u2018unique.\u2019 But I think this is one of those finds that literally is,\u201d Horn said. \n \n About 300 people inhabited the fort in November 1609. By spring, there were only 60. The girl, most likely a maidservant but possibly the daughter of a colonist, was one of the casualties. \n \n Her bones were unearthed last August as part of the Jamestown Rediscovery archaeological project begun in 1994. About 18 inches of fill remain in the cellar, so it\u2019s possible more of her skeleton will be found. Enough of her skull exists, however, to imagine what she might have looked like, using CT scanning, computer graphics, sculpture materials and demographic data. \n \n The bones, the reconstruction of her head and the story were presented Wednesday at an event at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of Natural History. The remains will be displayed at the Archaearium, the museum at the Jamestown fort archaeological site, starting this weekend. A warning sign at the room\u2019s entrance notes that human remains are on view. There are no depictions of bodies being butchered, cooked or consumed. \n \n The starving time nearly ended the colony, which was riven by internal dissent, under attack by Powhatan Indians and short of food almost from its founding in 1607. A resupply fleet of nine vessels had left Plymouth, England, on June 2, 1609. Aboard, including crew, were 500 people, of which perhaps three dozen were women and girls. The fleet was struck by a hurricane on July 23, 1609. One ship sank. The flagship, Sea Venture, wrecked on Bermuda. Most of the passengers and crew escaped to the island, an event that became the kernel of William Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cThe Tempest.\u201d Among the survivors was the colony\u2019s incoming lieutenant governor, Thomas Gates. (The marooned fashioned two boats from the wreck\u2019s remains and miraculously sailed into Jamestown the next May.) \n \n The seven other ships, scattered and damaged, sailed on. Six arrived in mid-August, with the girl, whom the researchers have named \u201cJane,\u201d almost certainly on one of them. The seventh ship arrived in October. \n \n The new arrivals \u2014 about 300 people \u2014 proved to be as much a drain on the colony as a relief. \n \n The ships\u2019 crews hoarded provisions. The summer corn crop was enough to feed only about 50 people for a year. The colony\u2019s military leader, Capt. John Smith, sent two groups of colonists upstream and downstream to fend for themselves. He was badly wounded in what was probably an assassination attempt and in October sailed home with the ships. By then, people were already going hungry. \n \n The girl\u2019s bones were found mixed with those of a horse, dogs and squirrels \u2014 testament to the extreme food sources the colonists turned to that winter. They were part of the trash collected in a fort-wide cleanup and dumped in the cellar before the arrival of the colony\u2019s governor, Lord De La Warr, the following June. \n \n The cause of her death isn\u2019t known. The tentative cuts to the front of the skull and the deeper ones to the back are close together \u2014 evidence that she was dead, not squirming, when they were made. The temporal bone was pried off to reach the brain. There are dozens of cuts to the jaw, suggesting that muscle was stripped from it. \n \n Could the marks have been left by animals? \n \n \u201cNot a chance,\u201d Owsley said. \u201cI deal with this all the time. Not a chance.\u201d In fact, he says with confidence that the dissector or dissectors were right-handed. \n \n Chemical analysis of the bone reveals an enriched \u201cnitrogen profile,\u201d evidence of lots of protein in the girl\u2019s diet. That, in turn, suggests she was a member of a high-born family or at least lived in such a household for much of her life. \n \n She wouldn\u2019t have gone to Jamestown alone. Whoever accompanied her was probably dead by the time she became food for the starving. \u201cIf she\u2019d had a family to protect her \u2014 after death as well as before \u2014 this probably wouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d Horn said. \n \n Learning who she was will be difficult. Complete passenger lists for the voyages don\u2019t exist. Research into the Virginia Company\u2019s sponsors in Plymouth might reveal a family with a girl born in 1595 or 1596 who went to America. There may be extractable DNA in the bone fragments, but at this point, there are no descendants to compare it with. \n \n Even the appearance that Owsley and his collaborator, Kari Bruwelheide, gave the girl is to some extent guesswork. \n \n They used the thickness of facial tissue seen among girls in contemporary southern England to gauge Jane\u2019s. They gave her consensus hair \u2014 light brown \u2014 not the red or blond of other latitudes and regions. They also chose not to depict her as she undoubtedly was before death \u2014 gaunt and emaciated. \n \n \u201cBut I didn\u2019t make her look like a healthy, plump teenager either,\u201d Owsley said. \u201cI\u2019m putting her in her circumstances.\u201d \n \n Those include dirt on her face and a thousand-yard stare, but not, alas, her name.",

    "document": "Click image above to view graphic \n \n Although the prospect of a pill for Alzheimer's remains a long way off, the landmark British study provides a major new pathway for future drug treatments. \n \n The compound works by blocking a faulty signal in brains affected by neurodegenerative diseases, which shuts down the production of essential proteins, leading to brain cells being unprotected and dying off. \n \n It was tested in mice with prion disease - the best animal model of human neurodegenerative disorders - but scientists said they were confident the same principles would apply in a human brain with debilitating brain diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's. \n \n The study, published today in the journal Science Translational Medicine, was carried out at the Medical Research Council's (MRC) Toxicology Unit at the University of Leicester. \n \n \u201cIt's a real step forward,\u201d team leader Professor Giovanna Mallucci told The Independent. \u201cIt's the first time a substance has been given to mice that prevents brain disease. The fact that this is a compound that can be given orally, that gets into the brain and prevents brain disease, is a first in itself\u2026 We can go forward and develop better molecules and I can't see why preventing this process should only be restricted to mice. I think this probably will translate into other mammalian brains.\u201d \n \n In debilitating brain diseases like Alzheimer's, the production of new proteins in the brain is shut down by a build-up of \u201cmisfolded proteins\u201d or amyloids. This build-up leads to an \u201cover-activation\u201d of a natural defence mechanism that stops essential proteins being produced. Without these proteins to protect them, brain cells die off - leading to the symptoms of diseases like Alzheimer's. \n \n The compound used in the study works by inhibiting an enzyme, known as PERK, which plays a key role in activating this defence mechanism. In mice with prion's disease, it restored proteins to protect brain cells \u201cstopping the disease in its tracks\u201d, restoring some normal behaviours and preventing memory loss. \n \n Although the compound also produced significant side effects in mice, including weight loss and mild diabetes, which was caused by damage to the pancreas, Professor Mallucci said it would \u201cnot be impossible\u201d to develop a drug that protected the brain without the side effects and that work towards doing so had been \u201cvery promising\u201d. \n \n The breakthrough was greeted with excitement by scientists, who nonetheless cautioned that it remained a significant proof of principle and a possible basis for new treatments, rather than a guarantee of an Alzheimer's cure in the near future. \n \n Computer graphic of a vertical (coronal) slice through the brain of an Alzheimer patient (credit: Science Photo Library) \n \n Professor Roger Morris, acting head King's College London's department of chemistry, said: \u201cThis is the first convincing report that a small drug, of the type most conveniently turned into medicines, stops the progressive death of neurons in the brain as found, for instance, in Alzheimer's disease. True, this study has been done in mice, not man; and it is prion disease, not Alzheimer's, that has been cured. However, there is considerable evidence that the way neurons die in both diseases is similar; and lessons learned in mice from prion disease have proved accurate guides to attenuate the progress of Alzheimer's disease in patients.\u201d \n \n \u201cFrom finding the first effective drug in a mouse, to having an effective medicine in man, usually takes decades to bring to fruition, in the very few cases in which it is successful. So, a cure for Alzheimer's is not just around the corner. However, the critical point of principle made by Professor Mallucci's study is that a drug, given orally, can arrest neurodegeneration caused by amyloid in the brain. \n \n \u201dThis finding, I suspect, will be judged by history as a turning point in the search for medicines to control and prevent Alzheimer's disease.\u201c \n \n David Allsopp, professor of neuroscience at Lancaster University said that the study had thrown up \u201dvery dramatic and highly encouraging results\u201c, but said that more research was needed to overcome the \"problematic side-effects\" and to prove the technique would be effective against other disease like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. \n \n There are currently 800,000 people in the UK with dementia and Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause. The number of people living with the condition is set to break one million by 2021, and represents an enormous health burden for the NHS and the social care system. Parkinson's affect 1 in 500 people and around 127,000 people suffer from the condition. \n \n Dr Eric Karran, director of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: \"Targeting a mechanism relevant to a number of neurodegenerative diseases could yield a single drug with wide-reaching benefits, but this compound is still at an early stage. It will be important for these findings to be repeated and tested in models of other neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. While Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia, other diseases that cause dementia are also characterised by the abnormal build-up of proteins in the brain. \n \n \u201cIf this process is also working overtime in these conditions too, targeting it could be a promising avenue for investigation. However, what is true in animals does not always hold true in people and the ultimate test for this compound will be to see whether it is safe and effective in people with these diseases.\u201d ||||| Scientists are hailing a landmark British study which has paved the way for a pill that can cure brain diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's by stopping the death of neurons. \n \n The Medical Research Council (MRC) team focused on the root cause of many degenerative brain diseases - abnormally shaped proteins that stick together in clumps and fibres. \n \n When enough misshapen protein builds up in the brain it can trigger a reaction that results in the death of nerve cells. \n \n Other approaches have sought to stop or limit the accumulation of the abnormal protein, whose structure is folded the wrong way. \n \n But this research, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, targeted the harmful way brain cells react to misfolded proteins. \n \n Using a drug injected into the stomachs of mice through a mouth tube, they flipped a cellular switch from \"off\" to \"on\" to prevent neurons dying. \n \n Five weeks after treatment one group of mice remained free of symptoms such as memory loss, impaired reflexes and limb dragging. \n \n They also lived longer than untreated animals with the same brain disease. \n \n During the study, a neurodegenerative disease caused by abnormal prion proteins was induced in the mice. \n \n Prion diseases, which include Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), are rare in humans but share the same underlying cause - misfolded proteins - as more common conditions such as Alzheimer's. \n \n Lead scientist Professor Giovanna Mallucci, from the MRC Toxicology Unit, said: \"We were extremely excited when we saw the treatment stop the disease in its tracks and protect brain cells, restoring some normal behaviours and preventing memory loss in the mice.\" \n \n The scientists stress human trials are a long way off and point out that the mice suffered serious side effects, including significant weight loss and raised blood sugar. \n \n But they also believe the research demonstrates in principle the possibility of developing an oral treatment - a pill or swallowed liquid - that can protect the brain from neurodegenerative disease. \n \n The research is at a very early stage and it could be a decade or more before the medicine is actually developed. \n \n But experts said the findings were highly significant. \n \n Professor Roger Morris, from King's College London, said: \"This is the first convincing report that a small drug, of the type most conveniently turned into medicines, stops the progressive death of neurons in the brain as found, for instance, in Alzheimer's disease. \n \n \"True, this study has been done in mice, not man; and it is prion disease, not Alzheimer's, that has been cured. \n \n \"However, there is considerable evidence that the way neurons die in both diseases is similar; and lessons learned in mice from prion disease have proved accurate guides to attenuate the progress of Alzheimer's disease in patients.\" \n \n He added: \"This finding, I suspect, will be judged by history as a turning point in the search for medicines to control and prevent Alzheimer's disease.\" \n \n Professor David Allsop, from the University of Lancaster, said: \"Inhibiting this pathway has produced some very dramatic and highly encouraging results in mice infected with prion disease. \n \n \"The main caveats of the research, however, are that prion disease is very rare in humans, and it is not yet clear if the same approach will be viable for much more common neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. \n \n \"More research is needed to determine if this approach is valid for any condition other than prion disease, and also to find ways of getting around these problematic side-effects.\"",
    "summary": "\u2013 Scientists are calling it a breakthrough and a turning point: In a new study, a compound successfully halted brain cell death in mice, meaning we're one step closer to a pill that can treat Alzheimer's, the Independent reports. Neurodegenerative diseases halt the production of key proteins, which in turn results in the unprotected brain cells dying off, and symptoms appearing. The compound blocks the faulty brain signal that causes the initial \"shutdown,\" thus basically flipping the switch from \"off\" back to \"on.\" Proteins are produced, brain cells are protected, and symptoms are reversed. The mice in the study had prion disease, which is similar to a human neurodegenerative disorder. After receiving the compound, memory loss and other symptoms including impaired reflexes and limb dragging were reversed; the treated mice also lived longer than those who didn't receive the compound, Sky News reports. Though it's still a long way off, scientists think a treatment based on these findings could also help people with Parkinson's disease.

That amount weighs about 11 times as much as the Great Pyramid of Giza. \n \n China currently leads the world in production of electrical and electronic equipment. In 2012, China produced about 12.2 million tons (11.1 million metric tons), followed by the U.S. with about 11 million tons (10 million metric tons). \n \n However, the United States eclipses China in e-waste generation, because more products previously put on the market in the U.S. are likely to be retired. In 2012, the U.S. produced about 10.4 million tons (9.4 million metric tons), versus China's 8 million tons (7.3 million metric tons). \n \n The U.S. generated the seventh highest amount of e-waste per person \u2014 about 66 lbs. (30 kg) per capita. (The country with the highest per capita e-waste was Qatar.) \n \n E-waste in the U.S. \n \n The U.S. National Center for Electronics Recycling (NCER) and MIT have released a detailed report on U.S. generation, collection and export of used electronics in conjunction with the e-waste map. \n \n The U.S. generated about 258.2 million units of used computers, monitors, TVs and cellphones in 2010, 171.4 million of which were collected for recycling, and 14.4 million were exported, according to the report. [Green Guide to Holiday Electronic Gifts (Op-Ed)] \n \n The U.S. is a major exporter of used electronics. The U.S. exports more CRT (cathode ray tube) monitors by weight than any other product, and more cellphones than any other electronics product in terms of numbers. \n \n However, export numbers could be an underestimate, because exporters want to keep them quiet in order to bypass restrictions or bad press, said Jason Linnell, executive director of NCER. \n \n In terms of recycling, \"We are a little bit behind compared with countries in the European Union,\" Linnell told LiveScience.European countries have had established e-waste recycling programs for more than 10 years, whereas only 25 U.S. states have started similar programs, Linnell said. \n \n But recycling of e-waste is on the rise. \"We're seeing more recycling programs, and a lot of states are collecting 5 to 6 lbs. (2.3 to 2.7 kg) of e-waste per person per year,\" he said. \n \n \"It's better than the past, but we we still have a ways to go,\" Linnell said. \n \n Follow Tanya Lewis on Twitterand Google+.

Original article on LiveScience. ||||| It has been called the \u201cdirty underbelly\u201d of electronics. \n \n E-waste \u2014 all those discarded electrical or electronic devices, from cell phones and TVs to tablets and computers. \n \n The numbers are staggering. And now, a world e-waste map \u2014 the first of its kind \u2014 shows just how staggering. \n \n The average Canadian, for example, generated about 24 kilograms of e-waste in 2012. That\u2019s more than 860,000 tonnes for the entire country, roughly equivalent to the weight of about 1,700 fully loaded Boeing 747s at take off. \n \n But the biggest producer of e-waste is the United States, with an astonishing 9,359,000 tonnes produced in 2012, about 29 kilograms per person, according to the map, which was created by a number of agencies through their \u201csolving e-waste problem\u201d (StEP) initiative. \n \n The numbers are mind-boggling, said Josh Lepawsky, a professor at Memorial University in St. John\u2019s, N.L., and a member of StEP. \n \n \u201cThe main purpose (of the map) is to give a sense how much electronic waste is present in any given any country,\u201d said Lepawsky. \n \n It also allows a comparison between purchasing power in different countries, which is a measure of wealth, he said. \n \n (The richer the country, the more e-waste it generally generates.) \n \n By 2017, the volume of discarded e-products worldwide is expected to be 33 per cent higher than in 2012 and weigh the equivalent of eight of the Great Pyramids of Egypt. \n \n Haiti is among the lowest producers of e-waste in the world, with less than 8,000 tonnes produced in 2012, or less than one kilogram per person. \n \n Afghanistan, too, was among the lowest in the world, with less than 19,000 tonnes of e-waste for the country, or 0.58 kilogram per person. \n \n The map is surprising in parts, said Lepawsky. \n \n Singapore is much wealthier than Canada, he said, \u201cwhen you look at e-waste generated.\u201d In Singapore, a tiny country, the average person generated about 36 kilograms in 2012. \n \n \u201cThe world is changing quite quickly,\u201d he said. \n \n Luxembourg is another example. \n \n It has a much smaller population than the U.S., 520,000, compared to more than 314 million, but more new electrical and electronic equipment comes to the market in Luxembourg per capita. \n \n (The U.S. is the largest consumer in absolute terms but it is behind Luxembourg in per capita terms.) \n \n It is a disheartening number, said Miriam Diamond, a professor in the department of earth sciences at the University of Toronto, referring to the e-waste that emanates from Canada. \n \n \u201cIt represents throwing away a tremendous amount of energy that went into making it in the first place.\u201d \n \n Used electronics often make their way to the developing world where some are reused. \n \n But, Diamond says, \u201cIn a lot of the recycling sector, they are dismantled by hand. That is a serious threat to health and the environment.\u201d \n \n Innovation is a trademark in the world of electronics, especially in the world of cellphones, laptops and computers, where engineers come up with distinct, sleek styles to lure people to buy more. \n \n \u201cWhy won\u2019t these same smart people also find a way that electronics can be used longer or reused in the best way, too?\u201d she asked. \n \n The cost of mining new resources is also staggering. \n \n \u201cThese minerals that we mine are scarce. . . is it worth it? Mining, too, has negative impact on people and places.\u201d \n \n For Lepawsky, the solution to the tonnes of e-waste is relatively simple. \n \n \u201cStop buying new electronics; use what you have for longer,\u201d he said, adding that sometimes buying new products is about fashion more than anything else. ||||| An employee holds circuit boards at the Coopermiti warehouse of electronic waste in Sao Paulo March 6, 2013. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Brazil generates the greatest amount of electronic waste (e-waste) per capita among emerging countries. \n \n OSLO (Reuters) - China and other emerging economies have overtaken Western nations in dumping old electronic goods, from TVs to cellphones, and will lead a projected 33 percent surge in the amount of waste from 2012 to 2017, a U.N.-backed alliance said on Sunday. \n \n The report, the first to map electronic waste by country to promote recycling and safer disposal of often toxic parts, shows how the economic rise of developing nations is transforming the world economy even in terms of pollution. \n \n \"The e-waste problem requires attention globally,\" Ruediger Kuehr of the U.N. University and executive secretary of the Solving the E-Waste Problem (StEP) initiative, told Reuters. StEP is run by U.N. agencies, governments, NGOs and scientists. \n \n The weight of electronic goods discarded every year worldwide would rise to 65.4 million tonnes from 2012 to 2017 from 48.9 million in 2012, with most of the growth in developing nations, StEP said. \n \n By 2017, it would make the annual piles of old washing machines, computers, fridges, electronic toys and other goods with an electric cord or battery the weight equivalent of 200 Empire State Buildings or 11 Great Pyramids of Giza, it said. \n \n Some waste from rich countries ends up in developing nations, where many people work in hazardous conditions for low wages dismantling it. \n \n Waste from emerging countries, as well as Russia and other former Soviet bloc nations, overtook totals from Western nations such as the United States, the European Union, Japan and Australia around 2012, StEP data showed. \n \n In that year, the West produced 23.5 million tonnes of waste and all others 25.4 million, a shift from the previous estimates for 2007 when the West accounted for most, StEP said. \n \n MOUNTAINS OF TRASH \n \n By 2017, trash from the West would rise to 28.6 million tonnes, far less than the 36.7 million from other countries, a side-effect of the economic rise of emerging nations such as India, Brazil and South Africa. \n \n \"Although there is ample information about the negative environmental and health impacts of primitive e-waste recycling methods, the lack of comprehensive data has made it hard to grasp the full magnitude of the problem,\" Kuehr said in the report. \n \n Consumers could help with better recycling, especially at Christmas, he said. \n \n Waste can be valuable if recycled. One study estimated that a million cellphones can yield 24 kg (53 lb) of gold, 250 kg of silver, 9 kg of palladium and more than 9 tonnes of copper. \n \n Sunday's report also showed that the average person on the planet produces 7 kg of electronic waste every year. Americans were among the highest with 29.8 kg each. \n \n Separately, U.S.-based experts trying to track the fate of waste said that about two-thirds of U.S. electronics waste is collected for re-use or recycling and that only 8.5 percent of the collected units are exported. \n \n Bigger electronic items, especially TVs and computer monitors, were exported to nations including Mexico, Venezuela, Paraguay and China, it said. Smaller items often went to Asia. \n \n Jeremy Gregory, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a co-author of the report, told Reuters it was hard to track trade because the waste is often merely described as \"mixed metals\" on import documents. \n \n StEP urged nations to adopt clearer trade descriptions. \n \n For StEP maps, click here: here \n \n (Editing by Alison Williams)",

    "document": "\"Tonight Show\" host Jay Leno is taking a significant reduction in pay and roughly two dozen staffers are being let go as part of a major budget restructuring at the late-night talk show. \n \n Although \"The Tonight Show\" remains the top-rated late-night program, from a financial standpoint it is only break-even, according to a person familiar with the economics of the show. One reason for that is that the production budget of the show was not reduced when Leno moved back to late night after his ill-fated stint in prime time during the 2009-10 television season. \n \n Leno's current salary is between $25 million and $30 million and he volunteered to take a cut if it would save some jobs. A person close to the network thought Leno's new salary is likely around $20 million. Bruce Bobbins, one of Leno's spokesmen, declined to comment. \n \n [Updated at 10:49 a.m., Aug. 18: In a statement later Bobbins said, \"Jay's foremost concern is for the wonderful people who work for 'The Tonight Show.' He did what was necessary to ensure their well-being.\"] \n \n While an NBC spokeswoman declined to comment on the situation, the job losses are said to be between 20 and 25 people and many other senior staffers also agreed to pay cuts. \n \n The weekly budget for Leno's prime time show was approximately $2.3 million and it stayed there when he returned to late night and Conan O'Brien was sent packing. The budget now will be closer to $1.7 million, which is in the range of what it was during Leno's previous late-night stint. \n \n Leno is not the first late-night host to agree to a salary reduction. In 2009, CBS restructured David Letterman's deal and reduced his salary and the budget of the show. \n \n Whether NBC will look to other areas to make additional cuts is yet to be determined. Earlier this year, the network trimmed its marketing and promotions staff. \n \n News of the cuts were first reported by Deadline Hollywood. \n \n ALSO: \n \n Movie review: 'Cosmopolis' \n \n Moviegoers still wary of theaters after Aurora shootings \n \n Robert Pattinson tries to separate professional and personal lives ||||| Related: Tonight Show Cuts Latest In Wave Of NBC Layoffs & Cost Trims Imposed By Comcast \n \n SATURDAY UPDATE: Jay Leno\u2019s spokesman has now issued this statement: \u201dJay\u2019s foremost concern is for the wonderful people who work for The Tonight Show. He did what was necessary to ensure their well-being.\u201d \n \n BREAKING\u2026 EXCLUSIVE\u2026 FRIDAY 8:30 PM: NBC insiders tell me The Tonight Show went through \u201ddownsizing\u201d today and that 20 staffers lost their jobs. Others tell me the number is more like 25, and producers were forced to take pay cuts or lose their jobs. I\u2019ve also learned that Jay Leno took what is being described as a \u201ctremendous\u201d pay cut to \u201csave as many people\u2019s jobs as he could\u201d. Leno\u2019s Tonight Show is consistently the #1 late night talk show in both households and demographics, except for some anomalies when Leno does get beaten. And that\u2019s despite the fact that the network\u2019s primetime ratings have been dismal for many years or that Leno himself was harshly criticized by the media for that January 2010 standoff with Conan O\u2019Brien. Even so, The Tonight Show has been and still is a cash cow for NBC. So what happened to merit the downsizing? \u201cI don\u2019t think ad sales are off. I just think the people who bought this company, Comcast, wants to go through everything at NBC and get their money back,\u201d an NBC insider tells me. \u201dIt\u2019s hard to go through those kinds of cuts. It\u2019s more a network issue than a late-night issue. And I would say that Jay doesn\u2019t get credit for digging out of a gigantic hole every single night. He\u2019s a very valuable guy to NBC and someday everyone will understand that. He does a great job.\u201d \n \n Related: Gabby Douglas & Michelle Obama Give \u2018Tonight Show\u2019 A Bump \n \n The downsizing also comes just 5 days after First Lady Michelle Obama appeared as a guest for the third time on The Tonight Show: high unemployment, job creation, and taxing the rich vs the poor all are issues in the 2012 president campaign. Leno has said publicly that he\u2019s able to bank his entire Tonight Show salary and live on the hefty fees he makes from his hectic personal appearance schedule. Leno\u2019s new salary is reportedly $27M-$30 million a year. He reportedly brings home another $15M-$20M a year from his other gigs. \n \n Leno replaced Johnny Carson as host of The Tonight Show in 1992 after having been a regular substitute host since 1987. He \u201cofficially\u201d ended hosting of The Tonight Show in 2009 when Conan O\u2019Brien started on June 1st. Leno was going to be paid for all of 2009 by NBC even though he was only working six months of it. When his ratings dipped, O\u2019Brien was asked to move The Tonight Show\u2018s time slot later to make room for Leno\u2019s return at 11:30 PM. O\u2019Brien refused. NBC gave Conan a $40M payoff (including salaries for his staff) to leave The Tonight Show hosting job which Leno resumed in 2010. \n \n Related: Gabby Douglas & Michelle Obama Give \u2018Tonight Show\u2019 A Bump \n \n Jay Leno Celebrates 20th Anniversary Hosting \u2018The Tonight Show\u2019 \n \n Jimmy Kimmel Bests Leno & Letterman \n \n Editor-in-Chief Nikki Finke - tip her here.",
    "summary": "\u2013 Jay Leno has long said he lives off his standup money and takes the millions he gets paid for hosting the Tonight Show and sticks it right in the bank. So the news that Nikki Finke at Deadline Hollywood broke last night might not sting quite as much for him: One source tells her that Leno took a \"tremendous\" pay cut, and the LA Times confirms it was indeed \"significant.\" The numbers require some guesswork, but the LAT thinks he went from somewhere between $25 million and $30 million down to about $20 million. Finke's numbers are higher. According to both accounts, Leno volunteered to take the cuts to save jobs, though at least 20 people got layoffs. Why the downsizing? Finke says it's not because of concerns about ratings or ad revenue, but because parent company Comcast is demanding cuts all around.

These really do appear to be quite specific to Alzheimer's,\" Kodadek said. \n \n They also used the test on blood from 200 elderly people not suffering from dementia and found 8 percent had elevated concentrations of the same antibodies found in Alzheimer's patients, which suggests the test may work as an early predictor of disease. ||||| Executive Health \n \n Early Steps Toward an Alzheimer's Blood Test \n \n Different immune system proteins exist in the blood of people with the disease, study finds \n \n THURSDAY, Jan. 6 (HealthDay News) -- A blood test that screens for antibodies, a protein produced by the immune system, may one day be used to detect Alzheimer's and other diseases, new research suggests. \n \n Though the research is still in its infancy, being able to detect Alzheimer's via antibodies would be a simpler and less invasive method of diagnosing the disease, researchers said. \n \n But the study's lead author stressed that the true benefits of such a test for Alzheimer's patients won't really arise until scientists develop effective treatments against the disease. \n \n \"It's unclear whether people would want to know a couple of years ahead of time they are going to get Alzheimer's if they can't do anything about it,\" said Thomas Kodadek, a professor of chemistry and cancer biology at The Scripps Research Institute in Jupiter, Fla. \"But I can say with some certainty that we will never get a good therapy for Alzheimer's without early diagnosis.\" \n \n The study, funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, is published in the Jan. 7 issue of Cell. \n \n Typically, in developing blood tests for diseases, researchers have searched for antigens -- that is, proteins from a virus, bacteria or other disease process such as cancer or neurological conditions like Alzheimer's -- that set off an immune response. \n \n Only after identifying the antigen would researchers then search for antibodies to that antigen, or signs that the immune system had picked up on the problem and mounted a response. \n \n But antigens can be difficult to find, Kodadek explained. \n \n \"In Alzheimer's, or in a disease such as cancer, it's not at all obvious what the initiating event is,\" he said. \"We just don't know what are those first weirdly modified proteins that are unique to the disease process that the immune system 'sees.'\" \n \n The new research went about things differently. Rather than search for the elusive antigen, researchers did \"high throughput\" screening using thousands of synthetic molecules, called peptoids, that would bind with the antibodies. \n \n Comparing blood samples from six Alzheimer's patients, six healthy people and six Parkinson's disease patients, the researchers found that two of the thousands of synthetic molecules \"captured\" at least three-fold more immunoglobulin (IgG) antibodies from all six of the Alzheimer's patients than from either the healthy controls or the Parkinson's patients. \n \n The synthetic molecules, in effect, acted as a lure for the antibodies -- enabling the researchers to spot biomarkers in the blood unique to those with Alzheimer's. \n \n This process could be repeated to test for antibodies associated with other diseases as well, Kodadek theorized. \n \n \"The big advance from what people have been doing before is that this method completely removes the requirement of knowing the native antigens that triggered the immune response,\" Kodadek said. \"The real excitement is it should allow us to identify biomarkers for any disease for which the immune system reacts.\" \n \n The synthetic molecules are easily modifiable and can be produced quickly in large quantities at lower cost, Kodadek said. \n \n However, while promising, the results are preliminary and need to be replicated in larger numbers of patients, noted Dr. Jeremy Koppel, an Alzheimer's research scientist at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in Manhasset, N.Y. He was not involved in the new research. \n \n \"This study represents a novel approach to the development of a noninvasive screening instrument for conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, which currently lack definitive diagnostic biomarkers,\" Koppel said. \"Beyond diagnostics, the future identification of the biomarkers detected in this study has the potential to deepen our understanding of the disease process itself.\" \n \n Another caveat is that the study was done in people who already had Alzheimer's, not those merely at risk for the disease. Further research needs to be done to determine how soon into the progression of the disease the abnormal antibodies can be detected. \n \n Right now, there are a few medications that can help with the symptoms of Alzheimer's, but there are no treatments that slow the progression of the disease. \n \n So for many patients, early diagnosis may not necessarily be something they want, Kodadek said. But from a research perspective, early diagnosis is a key to developing better treatment, he added. \n \n With neurodegenerative diseases, the hope is that drugs could block further decline, making it crucial to know if a person has the disease before they begin having significant symptoms, he said. \n \n More information \n \n The U.S. National Institute on Aging has more on Alzheimer's. \n \n SOURCES: Thomas Kodadek, Ph.D., professor, chemistry and cancer biology, The Scripps Research Institute, Jupiter, Fla; Jeremy Koppel, M.D., Alzheimer's research scientist, Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, N.Y.; Jan. 7, 2011, Cell \n \n Copyright \u00a9 2011 HealthDay.

(Photo by Todd Williamson/Invision for LA friendly House/File) (Associated Press) \n \n PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) \u2014 Author and actor Christopher Kennedy Lawford, who was born into political and Hollywood royalty, sank into substance abuse and addiction and rose to become a well-known advocate for sobriety and recovery, has died. \n \n Lawford died of a heart attack Tuesday in Vancouver, Canada, his cousin, former U.S. Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy, told The Associated Press. He was 63. \n \n Lawford was in Vancouver living with his girlfriend and working to open a recovery center. He had been doing hot yoga, which he did often, but the strain of it \"must have been too much for him at that point,\" Kennedy said. \n \n Lawford was the only son and oldest child of Patricia Kennedy \u2014 sister of John, Robert and Ted Kennedy \u2014 and Peter Lawford \u2014 the English actor and socialite who was a member of Frank Sinatra's \"Rat Pack.\" \n \n \"I was given wealth, power and fame when I drew my first breath,\" Lawford wrote in his 2005 book, \"Symptoms of Withdrawal: A Memoir of Snapshots and Redemption,\" the first of several books he wrote about his substance struggles. \n \n He wrote that his parents got telegrams predicting big things for him from Bing Crosby and Dean Martin and said he once got a lesson in doing \"The Twist\" from Marilyn Monroe. The cover of his books shows him sitting poolside as a child with his uncle and soon-to-be-president John F. Kennedy looming behind him. \n \n He spent his youth frolicking with Hollywood stars on one coast and rubbing shoulders with political stars on the other, living between libertine Los Angeles and the hyper-competitive Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, where he was a big-brother figure to John F. Kennedy Jr. \n \n \"You can't get much more fawned over than being a Kennedy male,\" Lawford wrote. \n \n His life with drugs began with LSD while at boarding school at age 14. In the years before he had experienced the assassinations of his two uncles and his parents' divorce in 1966. \n \n With heroin and other opioids as his substances of choice, Lawford leapt into deeper substance abuse in drug-heavy 1970s Hollywood, where his father also abused drugs and alcohol as his career faded. Peter Lawford died in 1984.

He had a small part in 2003's \"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,\" made appearances on TV shows including \"Frazier\" and \"The O.C.\" and had recurring roles on the soaps \"All My Children\" and \"General Hospital,\" playing a senator in the latter. \n \n He told the AP in 2005 that his famous dual identities both helped and hurt him in Hollywood. \n \n \"The names give you entree, absolutely, but it's a kind of a double-edged sword,\" he said. \"People do pay attention to you, but nobody gets ahead in Hollywood unless they are really lucky or they deserve it.\" \n \n He is survived by his sisters, Sydney, Victoria and Robin, and his children, David, Savannah and Matt. \n \n ___ \n \n Dalton reported from Los Angeles. ||||| JFK's Nephew Christopher Lawford Dead at 63 After Yoga Studio Emergency \n \n JFK's Nephew Christopher Lawford Dead at 63 After Yoga Studio Emergency \n \n EXCLUSIVE \n \n 10:45 AM PT: Law enforcement sources tell TMZ, Lawford was at a yoga studio Tuesday night when he had a medical emergency and later died.

    "document": "Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s retirement \u2014 coming on the heels of the chaotic, ugly realpolitik that followed Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death \u2014 is a good moment to step back and realize just how broken the process for selecting Supreme Court justices now is. \n \n In 2016, Senate Republicans responded to Antonin Scalia\u2019s death by inventing and establishing the absurd faux principle that open seats on the Supreme Court cannot be filled in an election year. Given that America hosts national elections one out of every two years, that means, in theory, that Supreme Court seats should remain unfilled fully 50 percent of the time. \n \n Democrats, infuriated by the GOP\u2019s treatment of President Obama and Merrick Garland, filibustered Neil Gorsuch \u2014 the kind of broadly qualified nominee who would\u2019ve passed easily in previous eras. In response, Senate Republicans eliminated the filibuster on Supreme Court nominations. \n \n What we are seeing here is a case of what the political scientist Steven Smith calls \u201cSenate syndrome\u201d: One side breaks a norm or rule, then the other side breaks another in response, and the tit-for-tat escalates until the underlying process is in ruins. That\u2019s now happened with Supreme Court nominations. \n \n Here, in truth, is where the past few years have left us. The minority party no longer holds a scintilla of power over Supreme Court picks. The majority party can and will jam whomever they want onto the Court, where that person will serve for life. But in times when the Senate and the White House are controlled by different parties \u2014 which happens fairly often \u2014 there\u2019s almost no chance that any seat on the Court will be filled. \n \n Imagine, for a minute, that Democrats win the Senate in 2018 and Ruth Bader Ginsburg retires in 2019. What are the chances, given the precedent of the past few years, that Senate Democrats will permit Trump to replace Ginsburg and give conservatives a 6-3 majority on the Supreme Court? I\u2019d guess somewhere between zero and zero. \n \n This is an insane way to manage one of the most powerful institutions in American life. But the decorous, gentle equilibrium of yesteryear was also nonsensical. There\u2019s always been something bizarre about the idea that a position as important, as long-serving, and as irreversible as Supreme Court justice should be made based on qualifications rather than ideology. \n \n Politics isn\u2019t a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 competition, it\u2019s a contest for power, and the wielding of that power has real consequences. In practice, the Supreme Court decides how elections are funded, whether abortions are legal, whether millions of people will continue to have health insurance \u2014 if elected politicians and activist groups see its composition as a matter of life and death, that\u2019s because it often is. \n \n Yes, Garland was relatively moderate, but if he had replaced Scalia, he would\u2019ve swung the Court to a 5-4 liberal majority, leading to a slew of transformative rulings Republicans would find abhorrent. Yes, Gorsuch was qualified, but he has ruled in ways Democrats find awful, and the clarity of his opinions will not soften their effects. \n \n For that reason, I don\u2019t blame Republicans for blocking Garland. Nor do I blame Democrats for filibustering Gorsuch. And I do not expect Republicans to give Democrats a sliver of oversight over Kennedy\u2019s replacement. \n \n But the result of both sides taking SCOTUS nominations as seriously as they deserve to be taken is disastrous \u2014 it will become common for seats on the Court, perhaps multiple at one time, to remain open for years, and when they are filled, they will be filled with more extreme candidates. \n \n The core problem here is the stakes of Supreme Court nominations: They\u2019re too damn high. Candidates serve for life \u2014 which, given modern life spans and youthful nominees, can now mean 40 years of decisions \u2014 and no one knows when the next seat will open. President Jimmy Carter served four years and saw no open seats. President George H.W. Bush served four years and filled two. Barack Obama served eight years and named two justices. Donald Trump isn\u2019t even two years into his presidency and he\u2019s already been given two vacancies. \n \n The result isn\u2019t merely an undemocratic branch of government but a randomly undemocratic branch of government. And that randomness, and the stakes of seeing it play out in your side\u2019s favor, makes it necessary to turn Supreme Court nominations into bloodsport. It creates incentives for justices to stay on the bench long after the point at which they should\u2019ve retired, in the hopes that they can outlast an ideologically unfriendly administration \u2014 Ruth Bader Ginsburg, for instance, is 85, but it\u2019s hard to imagine she won\u2019t do everything in her physical power to hang onto her seat until a Democrat can replace her. It biases presidents toward nominating the youngest qualified jurist they can find, rather than the best jurist they can find. \n \n We need to deescalate Supreme Court fights. The most obvious way to do that is to limit terms. Holding justices to a 10-year, nonrenewable term would lower the stakes of any individual Supreme Court nomination as well as make the timing of fights more predictable. An idea like this could have bipartisan support \u2014 Gov. Rick Perry proposed 18-year terms in the 2012 campaign, making an argument that I think sounds even more persuasive today: \n \n Doing this would move the court closer to the people by ensuring that every President would have the opportunity to replace two Justices per term, and that no court could stretch its ideology over multiple generations. Further, this reform would maintain judicial independence, but instill regularity to the nominations process, discourage Justices from choosing a retirement date based on politics, and will stop the ever-increasing tenure of Justices. \n \n Implementing a reform like this would be a step toward repairing and normalizing a process that is now dangerously broken, infuriatingly random, and distorting both our politics and the judges we choose to interpret our laws. ||||| The fight over President Trump Donald John TrumpScaramucci warns Trump must 'change tactics now' on trade Trump sought to purchase historic Scottish building for hotel: report Republican wins right to replace Farenthold in Congress MORE\u2019s next nomination to the Supreme Court began almost immediately after the news broke of the opening on Wednesday. \n \n Moments after Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy said he would retire, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellSunday shows preview: Supreme Court fight in the spotlight Appeals court nominees languish in Senate as Flake demands tariff vote Gillibrand incorrectly claims no Democrats voted for Trump\u2019s first Supreme Court nominee MORE (R-Ky.) said the Senate would act before the midterm election to confirm Trump\u2019s next nominee. \n \n ADVERTISEMENT \n \n \u201cWe will vote to confirm Justice Kennedy\u2019s successor this fall,\u201d McConnell said on the Senate floor. \n \n Democrats immediately cried foul, arguing the nomination fight should come next year. \n \n Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerOvernight Health Care: Judge blocks Kentucky Medicaid work requirements | Trump officials consider cuts to ObamaCare outreach | House probes HHS office in charge of migrant children Overnight Health Care: Amazon enters the pharmacy business | Two Republicans to play pivotal role in Supreme Court abortion fight | Senate panel approves medical research boost Lewandowski: Pelosi is not the leader of the Democratic Party MORE (N.Y.), recalling the bitter fight over Merrick Garland Merrick Brian GarlandBattle over Trump court pick to be most expensive ever Mitch McConnell\u2019s gamble is about to pay off \u2014 big time Dem senator: No argument will 'lay bare' GOP's hypocrisy on Supreme Court MORE\u2019s nomination to the court in 2016, demanded that McConnell hold off until a new Congress is seated in 2019.

    "summary": "\u2013 The fallout from Anthony Kennedy's bombshell decision to retire from the Supreme Court continues to resonate, with President Trump saying he's \"honored\" that Kennedy has given him an opportunity to pick a successor. Of course, getting him confirmed is another issue, and the Hill digs into the political logistics in the Senate. Republicans have the numbers, but two wild cards are Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, both of whom support abortion rights and will likely have a big say in who comes next. A remedy: At Vox, Ezra Klein writes that both parties are guilty of turning the nomination process into an \"insane\" one, given the stakes. At this point, if one party held the White House and the other the Senate, it's unlikely any nominee would be confirmed. His solution? Reduce the stakes by limiting justices to 10-year terms. A big percentage: The Washington Post picks out five times Kennedy cast the deciding vote on big issues, on everything from backing abortion rights to supporting gay rights to curtailing the death penalty. The story notes that of the 276 majority opinions written by Kennedy, 92 came in 5-4 decisions.",

    "document": "Image copyright PA Image caption Police said the suspected drone had struck an inbound Airbus A320, similar to this one \n \n A police investigation is under way after a passenger plane approaching Heathrow Airport flew into what is believed to have been a drone. \n \n The British Airways flight from Geneva, with 132 passengers and five crew on board, was hit as it approached the London airport at 12:50 BST on Sunday. \n \n If confirmed, it is thought it would be the first such incident in the UK. \n \n BA said it would give the police \"every assistance with their investigation\". No arrests have been made, police say. \n \n The Metropolitan Police said the plane was hit by the drone at about 1,700ft (580m) while flying over the area of Richmond Park, in south west London. \n \n No debris has been found and police have asked for anyone who finds drone parts in the Richmond area to come forward. \n \n The force's aviation security unit, based at Heathrow, is leading the investigation. \n \n 'Very real danger' \n \n After safely landing the plane, the pilot reported an object had struck the front of the Airbus A320. \n \n A BA spokesman said: \"Our aircraft landed safely, was fully examined by our engineers and it was cleared to operate its next flight.\" \n \n Chief Superintendent Martin Hendy, head of the Met's aviation policing command, said the incident highlighted \"the very real dangers of reckless, negligent and some times malicious use of drones\". \n \n A Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) spokesman said it was \"totally unacceptable\" to fly drones - which are generally used to capture aerial film or photographs - close to airports. \n \n Steve Landells, from the British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa), said it had been \"only a matter of time before we had a drone strike\". He called for greater enforcement of existing rules. \n \n Are drones dangerous or harmless fun? \n \n London music video drone footage draws criticism \n \n The rules for flying domestic drones \n \n Analysis \n \n Image copyright PA \n \n Leo Kelion, Technology editor \n \n Flying a drone near an airport can already be punished with up to five years in prison, and rules also forbid flying them \"beyond the direct unaided line of sight\" of the operator or near buildings and crowds of people. Drones may not fly above 400ft (122m). \n \n But the latest incident will only add to the pressure for further steps to be taken. \n \n The US recently introduced a compulsory registration scheme so any drone recovered from an accident can be traced back to its owner. \n \n In addition, officials could make it mandatory for drones to run geo-fencing software - that would prevent them flying in restricted areas. \n \n The Department for Transport has promised to publish a strategy for unmanned aircraft this year. \n \n Pilots have also called for it to fund tests into what would happen if a drone got sucked into an engine or crashed into a plane's windscreen. \n \n Last month, the British Airline Pilots Association noted that while the threat of bird strikes had been well researched, there was little data about how much damage a drone could cause a plane. \n \n The incident follows a warning earlier this year by the head of the International Air Transport Association Tony Tyler that drones flown by the general public are \"a real and growing threat\" to civilian aircraft. \n \n The UK Air Proximity Board - which investigates near-miss incidents in UK airspace - said there had been a number of serious near-misses at UK airports involving drones. \n \n David Black, from Blackwing Aerial Services - a company that specialises in licensed commercial drones - said education and enforcement of the current rules were important, particularly for hobbyists. \n \n \"I think a register is a good idea,\" he said. \n \n \"With firearms it has shown it's a good thing... but it has not stopped bad guys from getting guns. If you're going to use them as weapons, bad guys can build them themselves. \n \n \"You need enforcement, but the problem with enforcement is that it costs money and people to carry it out.... There needs to be better technology for detection and avoidance.\" \n \n Geo-fencing is available in some drones - a database within the drone will not let it take off if it is near an airport so that operators cannot accidentally fly into trouble. \n \n Mr Landells from Balpa added: \"The law as it stands says you're not supposed to go above 400ft (122m) or 500m away from the base unit, depending on the drone you're using, but we've been seeing incidents up at 8,000 feet, where drones just have no place to be, so we've got to do something. \n \n \"That's a registration process, some sort of tracking, some sort of electronic security - we've got to do something about this.\" \n \n Drone incidents at UK airports \n \n Image copyright BAA \n \n 17 April 2016 - A British Airways plane approaching Heathrow is believed to have hit a drone while in midair \n \n 28 November 2015 - The pilot of an A321 plane narrowly missed a drone hovering at 100ft above a runway at Gatwick Airport \n \n 30 September 2015 - A small drone helicopter passed within 30ft of the cockpit of an A319 plane while on the approach to Heathrow \n \n 22 September 2015 - A \"quadcopter-type drone\" missed the right-hand side of a B777 plane by about 25m while at 2,000ft after it left Heathrow Airport \n \n 13 September 2015 - A silver drone with a \"balloon-like\" centre missed an E170 aircraft by about 20m, while the plane was approaching London City Airport over the Thames \n \n 13 September 2015 - A drone flew over the top of a B737 aircraft while at 4,000ft, missing it by about 5m, shortly after it left Stansted \n \n 27 August 2015 - A DO328 aircraft flew within 50ft of a drone while approaching Manchester Airport at 2,800ft \n \n Source: The UK Airprox Board ||||| Story highlights London police seek public's help in finding operator of drone that may have struck airliner \n \n No one was hurt and the plane wasn't damaged, but authorities worry about potential for catastrophe \n \n London (CNN) Did a drone hit an airliner trying to land at London's Heathrow Airport? \n \n The pilot of a British Airways flight certainly thinks so, and now authorities would like to find out who might have been behind the weekend incident. \n \n British Airways Flight BA727 from Geneva was approaching Heathrow on Sunday afternoon when what the pilot believed to be a drone struck the front of the aircraft, London Metropolitan Police said.

Already, the migrant trail was adapting, finding new ways to reach western Europe. ||||| Refugees blazed a new pathway through Europe on Wednesday, with hundreds hiking through cornfields to reach welcoming Croatia even as others faced tear gas and water cannons from Hungarian police determined to turn them away. \n \n The contrasting scenes along the Serbian border highlighted both the make-or-break resolve of the asylum seekers and the growing friction facing Europe, which has failed to create a coordinated policy for the unprecedented influx of economic migrants and war refugees from the Middle East, Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan. \n \n \u201cWe hit a stone and we flow around it,\u201d said Arazak Dubal, 28, a computer programmer from Damascus, who had been on the road for 18 days. \n \n He and his three companions reached Belgrade only to discover on Facebook and WhatsApp that the Hungarian border was closed to refugees. \n \n \u201cSo I went to Google Maps, and here we are,\u201d said Dubal, huffing in the hot afternoon as he trudged across the farm fields. \n \n \n \n \n \n A two-hour drive to the northeast \u2014 along Serbia\u2019s frontier with Hungary \u2014 the route was slammed shut. \n \n Just steps from Hungary, thousands of people spent the night in the wet grass on the Serbian side of the border. Hours later, hundreds tried to punch through the cordon of razor wire and riot police massed near the Serbian border town of Horgos. \n \n But they ran headlong into security forces\u00ad who unleashed tear gas and pepper spray to drive them back. Some refugees were swatted by batons and crumpled to the ground in pain. \n \n [New threat on the refu\u00adgee trail: land mines] \n \n \u201cOpen the door!\u201d the refugees yelled as they hurled water bottles and debris at riot police. \n \n Nearby, children screamed for their missing parents. Water cannons sprayed crowds on the Serbian side, forcing refugees to retreat to a squalid squatters\u2019 camp that took root just after Hungary closed the border Tuesday. \n \n There were no major injuries, but some refugees were treated by Serbian authorities for respiratory problems from the tear gas and at least one migrant had a leg injury, the Associated Press reported. \n \n It was the first major clash between security forces\u00ad and migrants since police used stun grenades to stop refugees from crossing into Macedonia from Greece almost a month ago. \n \n \u201cWe fled wars and violence and did not expect such brutality and inhumane treatment in Europe,\u201d said Amir Hassan, who was drenched from a water cannon and tried to wash tear gas from his eyes, according to AP. \n \n \u201cShame on you Hungarians!\u201d he shouted, pointing toward the Hungarian police. \n \n At the United Nations, Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called Hungary\u2019s border crackdowns \u201cunacceptable.\u201d \n \n \u201cAll the countries have their domestic problems,\u201d he said, \u201cbut since they are the people fleeing the wars and persecutions, then we must show our compassionate leadership.\u201d \n \n Neighboring countries continued to heap scorn on Hungary\u2019s decision to blocks its southern border. \n \n \u201cBarbed wire in Europe in the 21st century is not an answer, it\u2019s a threat,\u201d complained Croatia\u2019s prime minister, Zoran Milanovic, in a direct jab at the blockades by neighboring Hungary. \n \n Milanovic promised that refugees would be allowed to pass through his country. \n \n He told lawmakers in Zagreb that Croatia would \u201caccept and direct\u201d the migrants to transit the country \u2014 comments that rocketed through the social media networks used by the refugees and increased the march toward Croatia. \n \n [ The limbo of the no man\u2019s land ] \n \n The river of migrants was swelling by the hour. \n \n By late afternoon, more than 600 migrants walked through fields and along small roads to cross from Serbia into Croatia, a European Union member, where officials set up posts to register names and details. \n \n Many traveled by bus from Macedonia and Hungary; others pulled up in taxis before crossing the border on foot and receiving a polite reception from authorities. \n \n \u201cWe want to keep them moving as quickly as possible,\u201d said Zdravko Helic, a civil protection officer in Tovarnik. \n \n He was proud to add, \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a single incident.\u201d \n \n Saeed, 19, a student from Damascus, called Hungary\u2019s treatment of the refugees \u201cold-fashioned racism.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re the first today,\u201d said Dubal, the Syrian refugee. \u201cThere\u2019ll be thousands tomorrow.\u201d \n \n Afterward they were taken by bus to a refugee processing camp outside the capital, Zagreb, where they would be officially registered. \n \n What happens after Zagreb was uncertain. \n \n Croatian officials said they would probably allow the migrants to continue their journeys by bus and train to Slovenia, Austria, Germany and beyond. But it was only Croatia\u2019s first day at the leading edge of the mass migration, and authorities were scrambling to coordinate their response with E.U. partners. \n \n \u201cWe will walk all the way to Germany if we have to,\u201d said Mohammad, 28, who worked in a mobile phone store in Aleppo, Syria\u2019s largest city. \n \n \u201cShop is gone, house is gone, some of family is gone,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I will walk.\u201d \n \n Like many in the migrant stream, he declined to give his last name out of fear of reprisals against relatives back home. \n \n The refugees had nothing good to say about Hungary. \u201cNot nice at all,\u201d said Abdullah, 24, from Aleppo, who smiled and waved at the Croatian police before they hustled him into a van. \n \n \u201cSee?

    "summary": "\u2013 More than 500 migrants have been detained for illegally entering Hungary or breaching a border fence, with nearly 50 criminal cases on the books since new laws took effect yesterday, the New York Times reports, while the BBC notes that Hungarian riot police today fired tear gas at migrants trying to break through the border with Serbia. And as restrictions tighten, migrants are seeking other ways into Western Europe through Slovenia and Croatia, as well as through Hungary's border with Romania. Issues remain: Hungary\u2019s poorer neighbors may be ill-equipped to handle the flow, and there are areas peppered with land mines, remnants of the Balkan Wars. While solutions are sought, thousands spent last night in a Vienna train station, per the Times, while at least 22 migrants drowned yesterday in the Aegean Sea, the Post notes\u2014a sad repeat of a similar incident a couple of days earlier. Leaders of neighboring nations are scrambling to come up with their own plans for dealing with the influx, which is no small task: The EU border agency notes a head count of 500,000 migrants at EU nations' entry points so far in 2015; last year that number was around 280,000, the BBC reports. Many are refugees fleeing high-conflict areas such as Syria and Iraq, per the Washington Post, which adds there's a noted \"absence of a coordinated policy for the unprecedented influx.\" \"Barbed wire in Europe in the 21st century is not an answer, it's a threat,\" Croatia's PM says, per the Post, adding that Croatia would \"accept and direct\" migrants through his country. An Egyptian billionaire who says he wants \"to clear my conscience as a human being\" has come up with an even more creative stopgap for the Syrian refugees involved: hosting them on two available Greek islands, using a joint-stock company to accept donations, Bloomberg reports.

The two rounds that were fired sent passengers scattering in panic. The shot were heard by a special agent of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). The HSI office is about 150 feet from the shooting. \n \n The agent ran toward the gunfire, continued Miller, identified himself as a federal agent and ordered Moore to drop the gun. Moore turned toward the agent who fired, striking Moore in the upper body. At the same moment, Moore turned his own gun on himself and fired. Moore was dead at the scene. Inside a black suitcase next to where Moore was sitting, HSI, FBI and Houston PD found a black suitcase contains a Smith & Wesson AR15 assault weapon with a fully loaded magazine. \n \n In Moore's car, more .223 ammo for the weapon was found. Earlier in the day, Moore had posted on social media that he intended to commit a mass shooting today. A handwritten note found on Moore's body said he had changed his mind and wanted to kill himself. \n \n An autopsy will be conducted Friday. \n \n The terminal was closed immediately after the shooting. But later Thursday, parts of the terminal were reopened to passengers. The rest of the airport remained open after the shooting. \n \n Darian Ward, a spokeswoman for the Houston Airport System, said some passengers who were scheduled to leave from Terminal B were rerouted to other terminals. \n \n Dale Howard, of Tomball, was at the baggage handling area of the airport waiting for his sister to arrive on an incoming flight when he heard two shots fired from the floor above. A few seconds later, he said he heard three more shots. \n \n \"People were screaming. I knew exactly what it was \u0097 gunfire,\" Howard said. \n \n Police from an adjacent station rushed in, and Howard said he directed them to the floor above. \n \n Greg Newburn, who was in the terminal waiting for a flight to Oklahoma City, said he was sitting in a cafe area when he heard two gunshots and after a pause, several more. \n \n \"It seemed like quite a few shots. Everyone was scrambling, running left and running right, turning tables up and hiding behind tables. Nobody knew what was happening. I couldn't tell where the shots were coming from,\" he said. \n \n Newburn, from Gainesville, Fla., said it took him a few seconds to realize that the shots had come from the ticketing area, near the security checkpoint. ||||| The seed for this crawl was a list of every host in the Wayback Machine \n \n This crawl was run at a level 1 (URLs including their embeds, plus the URLs of all outbound links including their embeds) \n \n The WARC files associated with this crawl are not currently available to the general public. ||||| Page 1 of 1 \n \n UPDATE: Houston police just released this portion of Carnell Marcus Moore's suicide note that they say was written on Hotel Derek stationery: \n \n \n \n \"Here in the last hour, I yield to mercy when this could have turned bad. Jehovah found a path to my heart, that love would conquer anger. The monster within me was getting stronger and while I could not save myself I could spare others. [redacted] Peace is within sight. I ask that authorities handle my disposal \u2013 Carnell Marcus Moore\" \n \n ________ \n \n A Beaumont man shot and killed Thursday at Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport was a reserved person of few words, neighbors said. \n \n But 29-year-old Carnell Marcus Moore wrote of death on his Facebook page earlier Thursday and, according to Houston police, apparently left a suicide note that said he was having trouble controlling his \"monster inside.\" \n \n Moore was killed in gunfire about 1:35 p.m. near a Terminal B ticket counter. It is unclear who fired the fatal shot. \n \n HPD spokesman Kese Smith said an armed male in his early 30s entered the airport and fired at least once into the ceiling just inside the doors of the terminal's pre-security departure area. \n \n Hearing the gunfire, a Homeland Security Investigations agent came out of his office and confronted Moore, ordering him to put down the gun, Smith said. \n \n When Moore refused the command, the officer pulled out his weapon and the man turned toward him, Smith said. \n \n The agent fired once, and Moore shot himself - apparently at the same time, according to Smith. Moore died at the scene. No one else was injured. \n \n Tricia Bentley, a spokeswoman for the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences, said an autopsy was expected to be performed on Friday. \n \n Hours after the shooting, officers were at Moore's home in Beaumont, carrying out computer equipment, a neighbor said. \n \n Marietta Kidd said she looked out a window toward the duplex where Moore lived and counted seven unmarked cars in her parking lot about the time school let out on Thursday. Kidd said her father owns the home and that her sister is Moore's neighbor. \n \n Kidd, who owns a beauty salon on the same street where Moore lived, said he had been in the duplex for several years and that he never talked much. \n \n Moore spoke of death on his Facebook page three times since Wednesday. \n \n 'When I go to meet God' \n \n The first status update was posted nearly 24 hours before he was killed. \"I recently had the chance of staring death in the face, and she was beautiful,\" he wrote at 1:26 p.m. Wednesday. \n \n About 12:45 a.m. Thursday, he proclaimed that \"This Life Will Crash Tomorrow!\" \n \n And about 12:42 p.m., he posted: \"45 minutes and 59 seconds in God's Shadow and Time Stops.\" \n \n His timeline also includes a video of a strained and sorrowful spoken word piece called \"When I go to meet God.\" \n \n The lyrics include: \"What makes a mother's son decide that death is better than tomorrow?\" and \"This is not a life worth living. I already ruined it.\" \n \n According to his Facebook profile, Beaumont was Moore's hometown, though he finished high school in a Georgia community south of Atlanta. He graduated from the heating, ventilation and air conditioning program at the Lamar Institute of Technology. \n \n 'He was a good guy' \n \n Colleagues remembered Moore as an affable and kind man. \n \n \"He was a friendly guy who talked to everybody,\" said Tim Knobloch, 29, one of Moore's tech school classmates in 2004 and later his co-worker at a Beaumont air conditioning company. \"He was a good guy.\" \n \n The shooting scene was chaotic, passengers and employees reported. \n \n Tina Gellinger, a 40-year-old Kansan who went outside between flights, was coming into Terminal B when she heard shouts to \"run!\" \n \n She and others scrambled toward elevators and hid behind walls as gunfire rang out. \n \n Nearby at the McDonald's in the food court, employee Tiffany Rigmaiden heard two shots, then shouting, then three more shots. The 23-year-old said a Transportation Security Administration agent running by told her and other workers to get down. Instead, they escaped through a back door and took an elevator to a lower floor. \n \n According to Houston Airport System spokeswoman Darian Ward, Houston police and the FBI \"interviewed quite a few people.\" She added that there was no \"visible damage\" to the facility. \n \n The incident also interrupted flights. \n \n Terminal B, where mostly smaller, regional jets land and take off, was shut down for hours. Incoming passengers were rerouted to enter through terminals C and E. At one point, a ground stop prevented planes from landing at Terminal B. \n \n Mike Glenn and Cindy George contributed to this report. Guiseppe Barranco reported from Beaumont.",

His is the 2,651st tribute to celebrity on the sidewalks of Los Angeles, and during his speech, the Doggfather wanted to thank the man responsible for all of his success: Tha Snoop D-o-double g. \n \n \n \n Snoop has definitely earned some tangible appreciation for his career, selling over 23.5 million albums in the United States and 37 million albums worldwide. And since he seems to be the Susan Lucci of the Grammys with 17 nominations, an zero wins, the Walk of Fame is a big deal. So when it came time for Snoop to recognize the person whose hard work and tenacity paved the way for the honor, naturally, the artist formerly known as Snoop Doggy Dogg and Snoop Lion gave thanks to the most important member of his squad: himself. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Snoop\u2019s been having a good year: His most recent album, Snoop Dogg Presents Bible Of Love, topped the gospel charts in March, and Redemption Of A Dogg, the semi-autobiographical musical that he\u2019s starring in, has just finished up its autumn tour. His new cookbook (From Crook To Cook: Platinum Recipes From Tha Boss Dogg\u2019s Kitchen) is available wherever books are sold, his GGN news show is coming soon in adapted form to film and television, and his game show (Snoop Dogg Presents The Joker\u2019s Wild,) is returning to TBS next year. \n \n And, if that wasn\u2019t enough, earlier this year Snoop Dogg set the Guinness World Record for the largest Paradise cocktail: a \u201cGin and Juice\u201d drink measuring over 132 gallons and containing 180 bottles of gin, 154 bottles of apricot brandy and 38 jugs of orange juice. Laid back. \n \n \n \n The fact that Snoop is indeed a hard working man/bad MFer isn\u2019t the only reason he has to shout himself out. While it\u2019s true that anyone can nominate a celebrity for inclusion\u2014including fans, the public figure\u2019s manager, agent, studio, network, or the celebrity themselves, there is a stipulation that whoever does the nominating also agrees to be responsible for paying the $40,000 it costs to install and maintain the star. That\u2019s why it makes sense for talent (or their family or studio) to nominate themselves \u2014$40k is a lot of money, even if you have eleventy billion income generating projects like Snoop does. \n \n ||||| Grammy-nominated rapper Snoop Dogg received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame ahead of the 25th anniversary of his debut album \"Doggystyle.\" (Published Monday, Nov. 19, 2018) \n \n Rapper Snoop Dogg, a 16-time Grammy nominee, received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame Monday, four days before the 25th anniversary of the release of his debut album \"Doggystyle.\" \n \n Talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, record producer Quincy Jones and the rapper Dr. Dre were among those attending the ceremony in front of the El Capitan Entertainment Center on Hollywood Boulevard where Kimmel's show is taped. \n \n After thanking friends and family, Snoop Dogg ended his acceptance speech by quipping, \"I want to thank me.\" \n \n \"I want to thank me for believing in me,\" he said. \"I want to thank me for doing all this hard work.

The company is reviewing taking legal action against both KTVU-TV and the NTSB.\" \n \n \n \n Update: The NTSB has released a statement stating an intern is responsible for confirming the incorrect names. Sounds like someone's summer internship is over. \n \n KTVU has also provided further explanation into why they said these names on air: They didn't say them out loud before rattling them off during their live taping and they didn't confirm with the NTSB employee (intern) on their position within the organization. They did, however, call to verify the correct spelling of the names. \n \n \n \n Update: Peter Knudson, a spokesman for the NTSB, just confirmed to SF Weekly that the NTSB did not release the names of the pilots of flight 214 to KTVU, or any news organization, for that matter. \n \n \n \n Original Story: Local station KTVU totally screwed up the names of Asiana Flight 214 pilots when announcing them on live television today, and we're a little worried the name \"Ho Lee Fuk\" might actually go down in history. \n \n So just to correct the record: The ill-fated Boeing 777 wasn't actually being steered by Mr. Fuk and his co-pilots Sum Ting Wong, Wi Tu Lo, and Bang Ding Ow. \n \n KTVU rushed to fix the blunder and issued an apology,blaming the NTSB for the fuck-up. The apology didn't do much to stop screenshots of the offensive names from making their rounds through the blogosphere. \n \n Oh, look -- here they are: \n \n And here's a video of the newscaster announcing the names with complete sincerity -- with \"Fuk\" pronounced \"Fook,\" lest you suspect the station of impropriety: \n \n Note: Asiana actually released the names of two pilots -- the ones allegedly responsible for the botched landing -- on Sunday. Junior pilot Lee Gang-guk had 43 hours of experience flying the Boeing jet; his supervisor Lee Jeong-min tried to take over to abort the crash. \n \n Someone call Ron Burgundy, this is a story for him. ||||| On today\u2019s Noon newscast on KTVU, the station claimed it had \u201cjust learned the names of the 4 pilots on board\u201d Asiana flight 214 which crashed last Saturday. But the station was given bad information that made it all the way into the newscast. If you read the names it becomes immediately clear this is a joke, which went unnoticed by the newsroom, producers and the anchor. \n \n You\u2019ll recall earlier this week, KTVU touted its coverage as being not only first, but \u201c100% accurate.\u201d \n \n \u201cBeing first on air and on every platform in all aspects of our coverage was a great accomplishment, but being 100% accurate, effectively using our great sources and social media without putting a single piece of erroneous information on our air, is what we are most proud of as a newsroom,\u201d said News Director Lee Rosenthal at the time. Watch: \n \n About 15 minutes later the station corrected its mistake, but claimed an NTSB official had confirmed the names. \n \n Earlier in the newscast we gave some names of pilots involved in the Asiana Airlines crash. These names were not accurate despite an NTSB official in Washington confirming them late this morning. We apologize for this error. \n \n > More: Further apology from KTVU president & GM Tom Raponi: \u201cWe sincerely regret the error and took immediate action to apologize, both in the newscast where the mistake occurred, as well as on our website and social media sites. Nothing is more important to us than having the highest level of accuracy and integrity, and we are reviewing our procedures to ensure this type of error does not happen again.\u201d \n \n >More: The NTSB has released a statement saying a summer intern \u201cacted outside the scope of his authority\u201d and mistakenly confirmed the fake names for KTVU Friday morning: \n \n The National Transportation Safety Board apologizes for inaccurate and offensive names that were mistakenly confirmed as those of the pilots of Asiana flight 214, which crashed at San Francisco International Airport on July 6. Earlier today, in response to an inquiry from a media outlet, a summer intern acted outside the scope of his authority when he erroneously confirmed the names of the flight crew on the aircraft.

First of all, we never read the names out loud, phonetically sounding them out.\u201d \n \n > More: The AAJA responds: \u201cThose names were not only wrong, but so grossly offensive that it\u2019s hard for us at the Asian American Journalists Association to fathom how those names made it on the broadcast.\u201d",
    "summary": "\u2013 There's not fact checking, and then there's ... not even using your brain. A newscast on Bay Area Fox affiliate KTVU apparently fell for a (racist and offensive) joke, incorrectly reporting that the pilots of the plane that crashed at San Francisco airport were named \"Sum Ting Wong,\" \"Ho Lee Fuk,\" \"Bang Ding Ow,\" and \"Wi Tu Lo,\" SF Weekly reports. The network later apologized, but said an NTSB official in Washington had \"confirmed\" them. It wasn't exactly an official. Per the NTSB: \"Earlier today, in response to an inquiry from a media outlet, a summer intern acted outside the scope of his authority when he erroneously confirmed the names of the flight crew on the aircraft.\" The kicker, as Mediabistro notes, is that KTVU had just been boasting about its \"100% accurate\" coverage of the disaster earlier this week.",

It could just be an interplanetary communications glitch. \n \n There are several transmitters on the spacecraft that will broadcast at different frequencies. Using one of them, the so-called X-band, the Curiosity will send simple messages directly to Earth.

That tracking would come from the Odyssey orbiter circling Mars, if the spacecraft is able to get to the right location at the right time. \n \n If not, the waiting time for a final answer on whether the rover was safely on the surface could range from two to eight hours. If no signal arrives from Curiosity via three Mars orbiters and the Deep Space Network after 18 hours, NASA officials said, then they would start to worry about its safety. \n \n The final descent has been pre-programmed and the army of engineers and scientists at the Jet Propulsion Lab\u2019s Mission Control have no control over it. \u201cOur position will be identical to anyone at home,\u201d said Adam Steltzner, lead of the Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) team. \u201cWe\u2019re all along for the ride.\u201d \n \n Speaking for the team as a whole, Steltzner said they were \u201cRationally confident, emotionally terrified and ready for EDL.\u201d \n \n Because the rover is so much larger, more complicated and more ambitious than earlier models, it has to land in a new and far more hazardous way. The landing, which could never be tested in full on Earth, includes a hovering rocket stage, a kind of sky crane, to lower it to the ground. NASA\u2019s chief scientist John Grunsfeld has said that because of that heightened landing difficulty, in addition to the unprecedented sophistication of the instruments on board, Curiosity is \u201cthe most important NASA mission of the decade.\u201d \n \n Worldwide spectacle \n \n The Curiosity landing is shaping up to be an international spectacle. Formal \u201clanding\u201d parties have been scheduled from South Australia to Rome, from Israel to Crete; and in the United States from Atlanta to Seattle, Milwaukee to Honolulu. \n \n NASA also has helped organize a landing gathering in New York\u2019s Times Square, which will feature a large screen that will beam the streaming news from atop a building and high above the crowd. \n \n Reaching, orbiting and landing on Mars is notoriously hard. In addition to the European Space Agency, nations including the United States, the former Soviet Union, Russia, the European Space Agency, China and Japan have sent missions to Mars since the late 1960s, but only about one-third of them have succeeded. \n \n The United States is the only nation to land a vehicle on Mars and complete its mission, having done it six out of seven tries.",
    "summary": "\u2013 The Curiosity rover landed safely on Mars early this morning, prompting whoops of joy and relief in NASA's mission control center, reports the New York Times. The rover quickly beamed back a picture of its own shadow cast on the surface of the Red Planet. \"Touchdown confirmed. We are safe on the surface of Mars!\" the team read out after receiving signals from the rover. After a journey of 354 million miles, the rover, which is much bigger and more complex than previous models, had to land in a new way that could never be fully tested on Earth, leading to what control room staff described as \"seven minutes of terror\" before confirmation was received, notes the Washington Post. As earlier reported, the spacecraft ferrying it had to rely on a supersonic parachute to slow it from 13,200mph to about 1.7mph; with seconds to go, the rover was then lowered to the surface using three nylon tethers and retro rockets.",

    "document": "\u201cNow, this is real simple,\u201d President Obama told a crowd at Prince George\u2019s Community College, in Maryland, in late September. \u201cIt\u2019s a Website where you can compare and purchase affordable health-insurance plans, side by side, the same way you shop for a plane ticket on Kayak \u2026 same way you shop for a TV on Amazon. You just go on, and you start looking, and here are all the options.\u201d \n \n As we all now know, the bug-infested Website healthcare.gov turned out to be anything but \u201creal simple.\u201d After the site\u2019s disastrous October 1 launch, the administration organized a frantic rescue effort shepherded by Jeffrey Zients, who is to become Obama\u2019s chief economic adviser in January, and on December 17, the administration tapped Microsoft executive Kurt DelBene to lead the effort to build out the rest of the Website. The site is working better (but as of this writing still not perfectly) for consumers, though the complications it has unleashed for President Obama will be even harder to fix. The New York Times called the broken Website a \u201ccrisis that suddenly threatened his presidency,\u201d and according to a CBS News poll, Obama\u2019s job-approval rating has plunged to an all-time low. Americans\u2019 approval of the Affordable Care Act has also dropped to its lowest level since CBS News began polling support for the law. \n \n The story of how the Obama administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the agencies tasked with implementing the Affordable Care Act got it so wrong is still unfolding. Much of the blame has to fall on an insular White House that didn\u2019t want to hear about problems, and another chunk has to land on CMS, which instead of hiring a systems integrator, whose job it would have been to ensure that all the processes feeding into healthcare.gov worked together, kept that role for itself. As anyone who has worked with the federal government on such projects knows, it is utterly inept when it comes to technology. \u201cThe government continues to struggle with how best to acquire the expertise to integrate technology,\u201d says Stan Soloway, the C.E.O. of the Professional Services Council, which represents contractors who work with the government. Soloway has a scary stat, which is that of the 80,000 information-technology workers in the federal government, for every one person under 30, there are 10 people over 50. \n \n That lack of expertise explains why in building healthcare.gov, the government turned to industry contractors; in particular, to CGI Federal, a subsidiary of CGI Group, a Canadian company. To those uninitiated in the dark art of government contracting, it seems scandalous that CGI, a company most Americans had never heard of, a company that is not located in Silicon Valley (where President Obama has plenty of Internet superstar friends who could have formed a dazzling brain trust to implement his signature legislation) but rather in Montreal, could be chosen as the lead contractor for the administration\u2019s most important initiative. While right-wing news outlets have focused on the possible relationship between Toni Townes-Whitley, senior vice president for civilian-agency programs at CGI Federal, and Michelle Obama, both of whom were 1985 Princeton graduates, CGI\u2019s selection is probably more an example of a dysfunctional system than it is a scandal. \u201cA lot of the companies in Silicon Valley don\u2019t do business with the government at that level [the level required for federal contracting],\u201d explains Soloway. \u201cIt is very burdensome, and the rules make it very unattractive.\u201d Indeed, government contractors have to meet a whole host of requirements contained in a foot-thick book, including cost accounting and excessive auditing, to prove that they are not profiting too much off the American taxpayer. Hence, there tends to be a relatively small, specialized group of companies that compete for this work, even on such critical matters as healthcare.gov. \n \n In this context, the selection of CGI, which has had a long relationship with the U.S. government through the companies it has acquired\u2014among other projects, CGI also ran recovery.gov, the Website for all data related to the Recovery Act\u2014doesn\u2019t seem so odd. Back in 2007, CGI was one of 16 companies given an umbrella contract to do unspecified systems work for CMS. These so-called indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity, or ID/IQ, contracts exist throughout the federal government. Companies compete to be on the list, and then when a specific task arises, they compete again to be awarded that task; but because the list of competitors is predetermined, the process is shorter. When the Obama administration selected a main contractor for healthcare.gov, they decided to use the prequalified contractors, rather than starting afresh, in order to save time, according to Bloomberg. CGI was chosen as the lead contractor for the Website over three other bidders: IBM, QSSI, and Computer Sciences Corporation. According to congressional testimony, CGI stands to be paid $292 million for its work on healthcare.gov. \n \n CGI\u2019s lack of visibility before healthcare.gov wasn\u2019t a reflection of the size of the company or how much work it does. With a market value of roughly $11.6 billion, CGI, after the decline of BlackBerry maker RIM, boasts of being Canada\u2019s biggest technology company. (All figures in this story are in Canadian dollars; one U.S. dollar is worth about 1.07 Canadian dollars at the present time.) In truth, companies like CGI are more body shops than true technology companies, and the projects they take on require a lot of grunt work by a lot of low-level employees. CGI employs almost 70,000 people, who are embedded in businesses and governments around the globe. Its U.S. clients have included the military, the F.B.I., Pennsylvania\u2019s Medicaid Medical Assistance program, and at least 40 state governments. \n \n CGI is short for Conseillers en Gestion et Informatique, or Consultants to Government and Industry. It was founded back in 1976 by two Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, Serge Godin and Andre Imbeau. The publicity-shy Godin, now 63 and still active as the company\u2019s chairman, became a billionaire this year, according to Slate, which called him a \u201cclassic tortoise\u201d who had built his fortune with a \u201creliable, and more patient, business strategy than stumbling on the right tech at the right time.\u201d He\u2019s received numerous awards and honorary titles, including being inducted into the Canadian Business Hall of Fame, and he is a major owner of harness-racing horses. His daughter, Julie Godin, is the company\u2019s executive in charge of human relations, and her father\u2019s presumptive heir. \n \n CGI has been a big stock-market success. According to the Canadian newspaper Globe and Mail, CGI\u2019s stock has risen an average of 25 percent annually for the last 25 years. At its peak in November, the stock was up almost 70 percent in 2013, and the problems of healthcare.gov seemed to be having no discernible impact. Slate said that that\u2019s because healthcare.gov is such a small part of its business. At any rate, CGI just reported revenues of $10.1 billion in its fiscal year ended in September 2013, up more than 100 percent from a year ago. \n \n Even before healthcare.gov, CGI was embroiled in its share of controversy about its work, from problems with Ontario\u2019s online medical registry to difficulties with the Department of Taxation\u2019s collection system in Hawaii. As CGI worked on healthcare.gov, government officials were frustrated with the company for missing deadlines, and Michelle Snyder, CMS\u2019s chief operating officer, told colleagues, \u201cIf we could fire them, we would,\u201d according to The New York Times. Both Marilyn Tavenner, CMS administrator, and Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of Health and Human Services, testified in congressional hearings that CGI didn\u2019t meet expectations. A CGI spokesperson says, \u201cas a matter of policy, we do not discuss the specifics of our ongoing client projects.\u201d \n \n On Wall Street, there\u2019s an entirely different sort of controversy brewing about CGI. Several smart investors\u2014including well-known short-seller Jim Chanos, who runs Kynikos Associates\u2014are betting against CGI, or shorting its shares, not because of the quality of its work but because of questions about its earnings. In September, Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Keane downgraded CGI to a rare \u201csell\u201d rating, citing quality-of-earnings questions. What he and others point out is that a number of questionable accounting tactics could be creating the illusion that CGI\u2019s business is far more successful than it actually is. After the news broke in Newsweek that Chanos was shorting CGI, its stock fell more than 12 percent, although it\u2019s begun to climb again. \n \n CGI is what\u2019s known as a \u201croll-up,\u201d meaning that it was built by acquiring other businesses, or rolling them up. Indeed, since its founding in 1976, CGI has acquired more than 70 businesses. (\u201cPlease stand up if you\u2019ve ever been acquired,\u201d Godin asked a crowd at a company gathering last February, according to the Globe and Mail. Almost everyone in the room stood up.) In the U.S., CGI built its business with the 2004 purchase of American Management Systems, based in Arlington, Virginia, and the $1.1 billion 2010 purchase of Stanley Inc., another Arlington, Virginia\u2013based company. Stanley\u2019s biggest customer was the U.S. Army, and the Stanley deal, according to Cormark Securities analyst Richard Tse, was instrumental in entrenching CGI with the government. \u201cThey are quite embedded,\u201d he told the Globe and Mail. \u201cStanley was an entity that was really effectively managing many of the back-office systems for government and military.\u201d Most recently, CGI bought Logica, a management-consultancy company headquartered in the United Kingdom. ||||| CGI Federal, the company responsible for building the problem-plagued Web site for the Affordable Care Act, won the job because of what federal officials deemed a \u201ctechnically superior\u201d proposal, according to government documents and people familiar with the decision. \n \n Not considered in the 2011 selection process was the history of numerous executives at CGI Federal, who had come from another company that had mishandled at least 20 other government \u00adinformation technology projects more than a decade ago. But federal officials were not required to examine that long-term track record, which included a highly publicized failure to automate retirement benefits for millions of federal workers. \n \n By 2011, CGI Federal already had been cleared to do government work at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency overseeing the rollout of the new health-care law. \n \n The company had been included in a pool of pre-screened, approved contractors in 2007, during the George W. Bush administration, and only firms in that pool were later allowed to bid for the Affordable Care Act work. It was at that earlier time that the problems at American Management Systems, the Fairfax County IT contractor acquired by CGI, would have figured into the assessment of CGI Federal, contracting experts say. \n \n In hindsight, one former CMS official said, the AMS record \u201ccould well have knocked [CGI Federal] out of the competition, and probably should have.\u201d \n \n View Graphic A look at the consumer's route through the HealthCare.gov website and the potential failure points. \n \n In light of the bungled launch of the health-care Web site, critics have repeatedly asked how CGI Federal got the contract, and there has been widespread speculation on online news sites and blogs that the firm was selected because of political ties to the Obama administration. \n \n But a review of internal documents and interviews with former and current federal officials show that the selection process was walled off from politics. \n \n Career officials at CMS, working out of an obscure Baltimore-based contracting office, focused in 2011 on the proposals submitted by four bidders, examining technical competency and cost while giving relatively little attention to past performance. Since 2007, CGI Federal had won 17 other CMS jobs under the pre-screened contract, worth several hundred million dollars. \n \n The review of CGI Federal concluded there was \u201cno evidence of performance risk,\u201d according to a CMS document, portions of which were read to The Washington Post by a person familiar with the contracting process. \n \n CGI Federal won the $93 million contract, now worth $293 million, in September 2011. \n \n At the time of the earlier selection process in 2007, CGI Federal was still relatively new to federal contracting. It had grown out of CGI Group\u2019s acquisition in 2004 of AMS, which had a recent history of troubled projects, including a Philadelphia school computer system that sent paychecks to dead people and a Mississippi tax system so dysfunctional that a jury awarded a $474 million verdict against the firm. \n \n Three former CMS officials said in recent interviews that the AMS problems should have raised red flags. \n \n \u201cShould CMS have recognized that \u2018Okay, here\u2019s CGI Federal. It\u2019s a new company, but, oh, my God, it looks a lot like the AMS from yesterday\u2019?\u201d asked one former CMS official familiar with the contracting process who like others interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal procedures. \u201cYes. I would consider that dropping the ball.\u2019\u2019 \n \n Tasha Bradley, a CMS spokeswoman, said in a statement that the agency \u201cadheres by a long- \n \n established contracting process where expert, career contracting officials evaluate and award contracts based on criteria outlined in the contract solicitation, including past performance, technical expertise and proposed contract value.\u201d \n \n CMS declined to comment on specific questions about how closely CGI Federal\u2019s past performance was evaluated and whether that review looked at AMS. \n \n Former AMS executives have defended that company\u2019s performance, and CGI officials have rejected any comparison with AMS\u2019s earlier failures. \n \n CGI Federal has also defended its work on HealthCare.gov, despite an October launch that White House officials have acknowledged was disastrous. Federal officials have faulted the company\u2019s performance, saying it missed deadlines, understaffed the job and overstated its progress. \n \n People familiar with the project have said it was also hampered by administration mismanagement, fierce Republican opposition and political sensitivities that delayed policy and regulatory decisions. \n \n The federal online marketplace that is selling health plans in 36 states under the 2010 health-care law has been functioning better in recent weeks, but officials are still working to fix lingering problems, including errors in enrollment records sent to insurance companies. CGI Federal remains intimately involved in the project, writing computer code in attempts to fix various aspects of the system. \n \n Linda Odorisio, CGI\u2019s vice president for global communications, said the company \u201ccontinues to work closely with CMS and all of its vendor partners to deliver continuous enhancements in system performance and the user experience\u201d on the Web site. \n \n She added that CGI Federal \u201ccontributed to the significant improvements made to the system over the last two months, resulting in more than half a million Americans enrolling in just the first three weeks of December.\u201d \n \n Umbrella contract \n \n In December 2006, CMS put out a request for proposals. The agency said it was seeking \u201cworld-class IT services\u201d to improve and maintain the massive systems that run Medicare and Medicaid, according to contracting documents. Thirty-one bidders responded, including CGI Federal. \n \n CMS used a procurement method that has become increasingly common over the past decade. The agency first awarded an umbrella contract to a group of firms, and those firms were then eligible to bid on future IT work. Experts say this saves the government time because it shortens the subsequent bid process. \n \n In evaluating the bids, CMS was to scrutinize each company\u2019s performance on previous contracts, according to an internal agency document obtained by The Post. The document described a \u201crisk assessment\u201d of cost control, on-time delivery and other factors. \n \n Federal law requires that past performance be considered for all federal contracts worth more than $150,000, with limited exceptions. Federal regulations also say CMS should have considered the record of \u201cpredecessor companies,\u201d such as AMS. Several former officials familiar with the 2007 selection said no concerns about CGI Federal were raised inside the agency. \n \n AMS projects had run into trouble at the federal level and in at least 12 states, according to government audit reports, interviews and news accounts. The purchase of AMS was CGI\u2019s entree into the U.S. government market, and AMS executives flocked to CGI Federal. Today, more than 100 former AMS employees are senior executives or consultants working for CGI in the Washington area. \n \n One former CMS official said the agency especially should have examined the most publicized AMS failure, an effort to automate retirement benefits for millions of federal workers. AMS was fired in 2001 by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board after going $60 million over budget, writing computer code that turned out to be useless and never delivering a workable system, according to government reports. \n \n AMS had settled lawsuits arising from the project in 2003. \u201cThat should have stood out,\u2019\u2019 the former official said. \n \n CGI Federal was ultimately chosen for an umbrella contract, worth up to $4 billion in future work, along with 15 other firms, including Lockheed Martin and IBM. \n \n While it is unclear whether agency officials examined the AMS track record, former CMS officials said it probably would not have made much difference, because past performance has long been an overlooked component of federal contracting. \n \n Deadline pressure \n \n In the summer of 2011, the Obama administration was racing to figure out who would build the Affordable Care Act\u2019s all-important Web site. \u201cTime is of the essence,\u201d said an internal CMS draft request for proposals, dated June 24, 2011. \n \n With deadlines looming, officials limited the bidders to the winners of the 2007 umbrella contract. \u201cThere was very great time pressure,\u201d recalled a former CMS official familiar with the process. \u201cThe feeling was we had a lot of big IT powerhouses and they knew our work.\u2019\u2019 \n \n Four firms applied: IBM, Computer Sciences Corp., Quality Software Services and CGI Federal. \n \n As is tradition, the selection process was strictly sheltered from political considerations and political appointees at CMS or elsewhere in the administration, according to numerous former and current CMS employees. \n \n \u201cI deliberately stayed out of contracting,\u2019\u2019 said Leslie Norwalk, the agency\u2019s acting administrator under President George W. Bush. \u201cIf that had changed, I would have heard rumblings.\u2019\u2019 \n \n Agency documents show that a career contracting officer, in the CMS Office of Acquisition and Grants Management, was in charge of awarding the contract for the Web site. The selection process focused on bidders\u2019 business and technical proposals, which described the proposed cost, hardware and software required, proposed infrastructure design, security requirements, and key personnel. \n \n The companies\u2019 past performance was not a priority. The CMS document listed it as the second least important of seven technical evaluation factors. And the review would look only at past work under the 2007 umbrella contract, the document said. \n \n While the review found no performance risk for CGI Federal, agency officials had not always been satisfied with the company\u2019s work. In 2010, CMS rejected CGI Federal\u2019s bid under the umbrella contract to perform work on four health IT systems, in part citing unspecified performance issues in carrying out an earlier contract, according to a Government Accountability Office ruling. CGI Federal protested the CMS decision, but the GAO upheld it. \n \n And the review did not take into account problems that several other CGI projects had encountered, including years of delay and system failures on a state computer system in Hawaii. State auditors in 2010 partially faulted another CGI subsidiary, CGI Technologies and Solutions, for those issues. \n \n CGI says its overall work is high-quality and nearly always on time and on budget, and the company has also had many successes. In the past two years, CGI Federal has been awarded contracts with at least 25 federal agencies. \n \n Documents and interviews show that CGI Federal was selected because of what was deemed to be the company\u2019s technical prowess, even though the price of the firm\u2019s proposal was higher than that of at least of one competitor.",
    "summary": "\u2013 It turns out there were even more reasons the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services shouldn't have picked the free-wheeling and allegedly shady CGI Federal to build HealthCare.gov. When CGI was vetted back in 2007, it didn't have any obvious black marks on its record, the Washington Post explains. But CGI is a \"roll-up\" company formed by acquiring other companies\u2014one of which, American Management Systems, was one giant black mark. AMS projects have hit trouble in at least 12 states as well as at the federal level, including a much-publicized 2001 failure to automate federal retirement benefits. The company went $60 million over budget on that one, yet produced nothing useful. More than 100 AMS alumni are now CGI executives or consultants. \"Should CMS have recognized that \u2018OK, here\u2019s CGI Federal. It\u2019s a new company, but, oh, my God, it looks a lot like the AMS from yesterday\u2019?\" asked one ex-CMS official. \"Yes. I would consider that dropping the ball.\" But it didn't come up in 2007, and CMS never re-vetted the company, the Post's review of internal documents reveals. On the bright side, the review also reveals that the decision was politics-free, made purely because officials considered CMS' bid \"technically superior.\" Vanity Fair, meanwhile, has an in-depth piece today on what many suspect is an accounting scandal brewing at CGI. It looks a lot like the company is using its acquisitions to mask financial problems, a quasi-legal practice known as creating a \"cookie jar.\"",

She is up for Best Supporting Actress for August: Osage County. \n \n Scroll down for video \n \n Nominated: Julia Roberts is up for Best Supporting Actress for August: Osage County. She is pictured left in the film \n \n Tragic: Nancy Motes with her fianc\u00e9 John Dilbeck' - who is said to be too distraught to face the public since her death \n \n \n \n 'We are talking about people who are powerful,' Conner told MailOnline. \n \n 'People who have very delicate power, people who are in the limelight. Their power can be destroyed very easily if unfortunate things make them look more wicked. \n \n 'They have to be careful, it can destroy their career or their Academy Award.' \n \n The insight into Nancy's life comes as RadarOnline reported that the 37-year-old who worked as a production worker on Glee was battling drug addiction and Julia had tried to save her numerous times by getting her to go to rehab. \n \n Authorities recovered both prescription and non-prescription drugs at the Los Angeles home. \n \n 'Julia tried in vain over the years, even in the last six months, to get Nancy to go to rehab,' a source close to Julia reportedly told RadarOnline. \n \n 'Nancy refused the offers and that is when she would often publicly lash out at Julia. It hurt Julia, but she knew her sister was battling addiction.' \n \n The sisters' relationship became even more rocky after Nancy blasted Julia to Britain's Sun newspaper last August. She also gave a bruising interview to the New York Daily News. \n \n Tragic: Julia Roberts' half-sister Nancy Motes killed herself in a desperate attempt to destroy the actress' career and scupper her chances of winning an Oscar at this year's Academy Awards, Conner Dilbeck, pictured, has claimed in an exclusive interview with MailOnline \n \n Busy woman: Roberts has been working the awards circuit for her turn in August: Osage County, which she did here on January 18 while attending the Screen Actors Guild Awards \n \n Plea: Conner wrote about his brother's fiance and Nancy's troubles with Julia Roberts on his Facebook page along with a photo of when John Dilbeck proposed \n \n According to Page Six, the Hollywood star was 'mortified' by the 'embarrassing' stories and wondered if her cash-strapped sister had betrayed her by selling the juicy details to the UK tabloid for money. \n \n \n \n It's not clear if Nancy was in fact paid by The Sun for the interview. \n \n However, Conner told MailOnline Julia inflicted 'pure cruelty' on her sister and Nancy's suicide letter was a desperate attempt to expose the alleged treatment. \n \n And a friend and neighbor of Nancy Motes told MailOnline that her death was 'not a Philip Seymour Hoffman thing' but a planned suicide. \n \n \n \n Conner claimed the note is eight pages long - not five as had been thought - and Julia is said to be 'terrified' about it coming out. \n \n Conner also revealed that John Dilbeck was overcome by the 'horror' of seeing his fiance's lifeless body in the bath. \n \n In a Facebook post Conner wrote: 'Nancy wanted the Truth to come out and she was Willing to Die to get her point across.' \n \n Conner, 40, lived with Nancy and John in their apartment in Santa Monica, California for years, during which time he saw their relationship blossom. \n \n But the dark side was that he claimed it gave him a front row seat to the he mistreatment he claims Nancy suffered at the hands of Julia. \n \n Watch the full interview on Inside Edition \n \n \n \n \n \n Emotional: Nancy Motes appeared to post aggressive messages onto her Twitter account in the weeks prior to her tragic death apparently attacking her half-sister Julia Roberts \n \n Conner said: 'I have spent enough time with Nancy and I know enough about her that I can say from first hand experience a lot of things that have happened.' \n \n He added: 'The truth is in the eight pages of her suicide letter.' \n \n In a series of furious posts on Facebook, Conner railed against Julia and squarely blamed her for the tragedy. \n \n He wrote: 'I am posting this as a plea to everyone to Pray for my Brother John. \n \n 'His lovely Fianc\u00e9, Nancy Motes, was driven to Take her Life yesterday because of the Pure Cruelty of her Sister, Julia Roberts (yes Ms. Pretty Woman herself), that has done everything in her power to Ruin her and my brothers lives. \n \n 'He is overwhelmed by this horrible event and all the Turmoil Julia has subjected them too.' Speaking to MailOnline, Conner said that after his brother found his fiance's body last Sunday he called the police and then called his family in distress. Breaking into tears, he said: 'The one thing that has made it more emotional for our family than anything else is to think of the horror of my brother having to walk in their and find his dead love in the water and nothing he could do about it and how she was driven to do this.' \n \n Oscars: Nancy Motes killed herself to scupper her sister's Oscar chances, it has been claimed. Roberts, left, stars in the film with Meryl Streep, center In the months before her death, Nancy took aim at her famous sister on Twitter and one particular tweet apparently gives weight to the claim that she was plotting to hurt the Notting Hill star in some way. Nancy's death hasn't officially been ruled a suicide as a toxicology report has not been completed but her the family said in a statement that she died of 'an apparent drug overdose.' In December, an emotional Nancy mysteriously tweeted, apparently about Julia: 'Hey Hag! Glad you f****ed with me yet? You're going to LOVE what's coming! FYI-You're an awful, hate filled old pathetic excuse for a human.' \n \n Conner's account comes after John Fraschetti, who also knows Nancy's grieving fianc\u00e9, claimed the family of the Oscar winner were now 'crying crocodile tears' over the former Glee production worker's death. He said they are only interested in manipulating public opinion after her suicide, but during her life, 'drove her to death.' Making the incendiary comments Tuesday outside Nancy and Dilbeck's home, Fraschetti said Nancy spiraled into depression after Betty Lou Motes, the mother she and Roberts shared, 'rejected' her six months ago - and that she 'just couldn't handle it anymore'. 'And then you get the actress woman who is pretending to grieve but she didn't want to deal with Nancy and made her f***ing miserable.' Nancy Motes was found dead on Sunday in a bathtub filled with water with prescription and 'illegal drugs' near her in an apparent suicide. Fraschetti claims to have seen the letter she left behind. \n \n Fraschetti, who has known Dilbeck since he was 13, said that since her death, her family have been careful to mold a favorable public reaction. 'They are crying crocodile tears. They have taken control of this situation, but they never cared of her when she was alive,' said Fraschetti. Fraschetti said that Nancy, 'couldn't stand the rejection of her mom, who in the last six months had cut her off entirely.' Upset: Julia Roberts' mother Betty Lou Motes is seen leaving her home in Los Angeles looking frail and upset Tuesday afternoon Cut-off: Nancy Motes is pictured in this photo with Julia Roberts when the Oscar winning actress was around 22 years old \n \n 'It hurt her that none of her family wanted to be with her. She had a miserable Christmas, truly awful, and I think she just couldn't handle it anymore.' \n \n Fraschetti admitted that Nancy's well-documented problems with drugs and her weight had caused divisions, but claimed that to cut her off was unforgivable. \n \n 'They didn\u2019t care when she was alive. She was a handful, and yes she had her problems, but there\u2019s a way to deal with your relatives,' said an angry Fraschetti. \n \n Nancy's suicide note also reveals the true depths of depression that her family's rejection had sent her to. \n \n 'It read about how much she loved and cared for her fianc\u00e9 and how happy he made her, but it also said how unhappy and depressed her family made her and how she couldn\u2019t cope anymore,' said Fraschetti, who said that fianc\u00e9, Dilbeck, is grief stricken by Nancy's death and can't face the media. \n \n Indicating that the suicide note goes into detail about how hurt she felt by being ignored, Fraschetti said that Roberts and her family even put pressure on Dilbeck to delete tweets. \n \n But, it was revealed last night that Nancy had apparently tweeted a string of vicious messages aimed at her Oscar winning sister, including 'Just so you all know \"America's Sweetheart\" is a B****!!' on January 20. \n \n That and others were indeed deleted overnight. \n \n \n \n Friend: John Fraschetti has known Nancy Motes' fiance John Dilbeck since he was 13 and says that Julia Roberts and her family cutting off Nancy caused her suicide \n \n 'We've got a person who is grieving so much, but then there is the other so called family who are grieving, so to speak, who want to see as little grief as possible for them,' said Fraschetti. \n \n 'It's the rich versus the poor, the fake versus the real, he's the one who's in agony, he's the one that's genuine.' \n \n And in an apparent confirmation that she did indeed commit suicide, Fraschetti said that her death was planned, but that she didn't use heroin like Philip Seymour Hoffman. \n \n She wasn\u2019t into heroin, as far as I was aware. It\u2019s not like her or John were heroin addicts. Come on, it\u2019s ridiculous. \n \n \u2018I wouldn\u2019t read too much into where she did it, it wasn\u2019t in some drug den. She was dog sitting, and I imagine she did this, so she didn\u2019t have to do it at home and let John find her.' \n \n And this afternoon, Julia Roberts' grief-stricken mother looked frail and visibly shaken as she visited the Oscar-winner following the apparent suicide death of her younger daughter, Nancy Motes. \n \n \n \n Dressed in a tartan hat and black jacket, Betty Lou Motes was driven by a friend from her home in Pacific Palisades to Julia's mansion in Malibu. \n \n The visit came after it was reported that Nancy left a five page suicide note in which she accused her famous sibling of driving her to kill herself. \n \n Her fianc\u00e9 discovered her body, which had been dead as long as 12 hours, but a responding EMT worker recovered the extensive letter, according to the New York Daily News. \n \n In the note, Nancy dedicated three pages to her tortured relationship with the Pretty Woman actress, the Daily News quoted a source close to the investigation as saying. \n \n Gone too soon: Nancy Motes, pictured in August (left), died on Sunday from an apparent drug overdose; she is the half-sister of Julia Roberts (right) \n \n Rage: Nancy Motes, tweeted under her husband-to-be's last name online. This vitriolic attack is believed to be against her half-sister, Julia Roberts and happened a little more than a month before she died \n \n Pain: Nancy Motes is also believed to have launched these attacks on the star of Pretty Woman and Mystic Pizza - calling her cruel and blaming her for causing her rage despite her best efforts to remain calm \n \n Sad: Nancy Motes posted these bittersweet tweets in October - in which she laments that she is having to leave her family to find the love she craves from another \n \n 'It was definitely a suicide. She left a five-page suicide letter. The EMT found it,' the source told the Daily News. \n \n 'There were three pages of rantings that her sister drove her to do this. There was one page to her mom, telling her how much she loved her, and one page apologizing to (her fianc\u00e9).' \n \n Nancy and Dilbeck were scheduled to be married in May, but the Georgia native seemed to be unraveling recently. \n \n On Twitter, she sounded decidedly unstable, lashing out at Julia, whom she claims bullied her about her weight when they were growing up. 'So my \"sister\" said that with all her friends & fans she doesn't need any more love. Just so you all know \"America's Sweetheart\" is a B****!!' she tweeted on January 20, referring to Roberts. 'Do you want to be a fan of someone so cruel? She's not even that good of an actress. Happy you totally F***ed with me?' she added in a subsequent tweet before claiming she'd never been more angry. 'I must admit I maybe going to far\u2026 But I never been so angry in my life. I'm actually a pretty easygoing, peaceful person.' \n \n '(M)y own family has abandoned me,' she tweeted January 22. Three weeks later, she was dead. \n \n The emotional comments, seen on the Twitter handle @Dabbs76, had been deleted by Tuesday morning. \n \n Family: Roberts with Motes and their mother Betty Lou when the star was filming 1997's My Best Friend's Wedding \n \n The most recent Twitter outburst followed similar rants late last year. \n \n For example, Nancy had written previously of her family abandoning her. \n \n 'Feeling blessed, even though I'm sick as a dog! I'm very grateful that I have my loves family, since my own family has abandoned me,' she tweeted, referring to her new partner. \n \n \n \n Her next tweets also appeared to be angrily directed at the Notting Hill star. \n \n \n \n She tweeted: 'Hey Hag! Glad you f****ed with me yet? You\u2019re going to LOVE what\u2019s coming! FYI-You\u2019re an awful, hate filled old pathetic excuse for a human. \n \n \n \n 'I must be grateful & not hateful. I must forgive. But Damn that is a REALLY hard thing to do sometimes, right?!?!' \n \n Back on December 19, Nancy also sounded depressed. She wrote: 'I must remember how blessed I am even in this very low point in my life. I want ALL of my family to have an awesome magical Christmas! ' \n \n \n \n And on December 15 she tweeted: 'Must remember to stay strong. Life is a fight. You have to stay in it.' \n \n \n \n Back in October Nancy also spoke about her family rift, tweeting: 'It\u2019s a shame when you get more support from strangers than you do from your family. I can\u2019t wait to officially belong to another family!' \n \n She also wrote that she was getting support from her and Julia\u2019s mother Betty, writing: 'So glad to have the support & love of my friends & mom! \n \n \n \n Still a smashing success: At 46, Roberts is more in demand than ever; here she leaves a talk about her Meryl Streep drama on February 4 \n \n Nancy last tweeted on Saturday, the day before she was found dead in the bathtub. \n \n \n \n She wrote: 'Hope everyone is enjoying their Saturdays & watching East Los High! Season 3 coming soon!' \n \n \n \n Nancy joined twitter last August and had 69 followers. \n \n \n \n She posted several happy photos with her fianc\u00e9 John Dilbeck who she was due to marry on May 17. \n \n Nancy had been tweeting excitedly about the big day, on October 21 she wrote: 'I found my beautiful shoes for my wedding day! And anyone that wants to bring me down during all the planning I have to do can kiss my ass!' \n \n \n \n On October 3 she tweeted a photo of them together, writing: 'YAY! Wedding Venue found! Wedding dress found! Things are truly happening! It's all soooo exciting! I love him!' \n \n Since her tormented tweets were made public overnight, they key sections have been deleted. \n \n \n \n On Monday, her family confirmed to People the 37-year-old had passed away in what appears to be an overdose. \n \n \n \n On top: The actress on the February cover of Vanity Fair, on stands now \n \n 'It is with deep sadness that the family of Nancy Motes ... confirms that she was found dead in Los Angeles yesterday of an apparent drug overdose,' the statement read. 'There is no official report from the Coroner's office yet. The family is both shocked and devastated.' \n \n \n \n She was discovered in the bathtub of a home by her fianc\u00e9 John Dilbeck and pronounced dead at 2:12 p.m., a spokesman for the Los Angeles Coroner's Office told MailOnline. \n \n It is believed she was found at a house where she was pet-sitting for a friend. \n \n Today, Ed Winter, assistant chief at the LA County Coroner's Office, said: \u2018The autopsy has been completed and the cause of death has been deferred depending on the toxicology reports. This can take between six and eight weeks. \n \n \n \n \u2018A number of prescription medications were found in the bathroom area as were illegal drugs. We are still investigating whether they were hers or not. We\u2019re not releasing what illegal drugs they were. \n \n \n \n \u2018It could be a possible suicide, but we don\u2019t know the cause of death yet for sure, which is depending on further investigation. It\u2019s more complicated as she also had some medical issues, so we\u2019re not sure what happened at the moment. \n \n \n \n 'We are not being specific what those issues are, but it could mean a number of reasons for her death, she could have been taking a bath and had a heart attack. We just don\u2019t know at this stage.' \n \n Julia's rep did not return calls to MailOnline. The actress cancelled an appearance at an Academy Awards luncheon on Monday. \n \n \n \n Nancy was an aspiring actress who had worked as a production assistant on TV's Glee. \n \n \n \n Julia and Nancy had the same mother, Betty Lou, but different fathers: Nancy's dad was Michael Motes and Julia's is the late Walter Grady Roberts. \n \n \n \n In August the blonde had complained about growing up in the shadow of the Pretty Woman star, who has been working the awards circuit this year for her turn in August: Osage County with Meryl Streep. \n \n Thinner: Nancy Motes looked considerably thinner in August 2013 as she grabbed coffee near her home in Santa Monica \n \n The younger sibling had said she was known as Julia's 'fat little sister' and said the Oscar-winner had taunted her about her weight, leading her to undergo weight loss surgery in June 2012. \n \n \n \n Roberts, 46, made her feel embarrassed and ashamed of her weight, according to Nancy, which peaked at 20st. \n \n \n \n She resorted to a \u00a320,000 gastric bypass operation last year. \n \n \n \n 'It makes me feel incredibly hurt and very sad,' Motes said. 'When you're in a family of very, very exceptionally beautiful people it's intimidating.' \n \n \n \n Her other siblings include Eric Roberts, 57, and Lisa Roberts Gillan, 48, who are also actors. \n \n \n \n Actress Emma Roberts is the daughter of Eric. \n \n \n \n 'I think that growing up as Pretty Woman's little sister has definitely made me try to see the person inside and not the person outside,' she added. 'A lot of my life I felt judged for my weight.' \n \n Motes, who grew up in the US state of Georgia, was only 13 when Roberts shot to Hollywood fame as hooker Vivian Ward in Pretty Woman. \n \n \n \n The actress, who had won a Golden Globe for playing a young bride in Steel Magnolias, received a second for Pretty Woman. \n \n \n \n Motes, who described herself as an 'awkward' child who was bullied at school, could not compete with the success of her 'very pretty and very popular' sister. \n \n \n \n She said: 'When I was in high school and she was an adult, she would just let me know that I was definitely overweight. She would make it quite clear to me and in a not so nice manner. \n \n \n \n 'Julia did not want to see me go down that path [of acting] \u2026 So I just got a lot of criticism from Julia, which was very discouraging for me.' \n \n \n \n After graduating from high school in 1995, Motes auditioned for roles in Hollywood while working as a waitress. But she could not afford to continue so returned to Georgia. \n \n Niece: Emma Roberts, pictured Monday with Evan Peters, was Nancy's niece \n \n Three years ago Nancy moved back to Los Angeles, after meeting her fianc\u00e9 John Dilbeck. But she claimed Roberts started taunting her about her weight again days after she arrived. \n \n \n \n With her weight soaring, she finally decided to have a gastric bypass fitted. \n \n \n \n Motes said she could not afford the \u00a320,000 fee, but rather than ask Roberts, who is worth \u00a390million, for financial help, she took out a loan. \n \n \n \n She had lost 7st since the operation last June and had planned on marrying in May. \n \n However, RadarOnline reported last year that Julia planned to boycott the nuptials because she didn't like the groom and didn't want to get stuck paying for the wedding. \n \n \n \n 'Julia doesn't think much of Nancy's husband-to-be,' the website quoted an insider as saying. 'She's convinced he's sponging off Nancy, who doesn't have much money in the first place.' \n \n \n \n At the time of her death, it was not known if she had mended her relationship with Julia. \n \n \n \n She said last year: 'It's a work in progress, it's not going to be fixed overnight, nor do I think it's going to be fixed by me just getting skinny.' ||||| Julia Roberts was left devastated and anguished that she could not convince her half-sister Nancy Motes to enter rehab before her tragic drug overdose death in Los Angeles, Calif., on Feb. 9, RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned. \n \n Motes, 37, a former production worker on the hit television show Glee, was found dead Sunday in a bathtub at a Los Angeles home, where authorities recovered both prescription and non-prescription drugs. \n \n A source close to Oscar-nominee Roberts told Radar: \u201cThe sisters had a very complex relationship. They used to be very close when they were younger. Julia tried in vain over the years, even in the last six months, to get Nancy to go to rehab. Nancy refused the offers and that is when she would often publicly lash out at Julia. \n \n PHOTOS: Stars Who OD\u2019d \n \n \u201cIt hurt Julia, but she knew her sister was battling addiction. \n \n \u201cThe addiction to prescription drugs made Nancy a totally different person. There would be periods of sobriety and with that brought clarity. It would be during those moments that the sisters would reconnect. Sadly, of course, those times became less frequent before her death.\u201d \n \n As Radar previously reported, Motes called the Pretty Woman star a \u201cb*tch\u201d and appeared to have called her a \u201chag\u201d as she vented in a series of tweets sent late last month. \n \n PHOTOS: Cheating, Gay Lovers, Incest, Drugs & Lip Synching! 50 Of Hollywood\u2019s Juiciest Confessions \n \n It was yet another illustration of the pair\u2019s rocky relationship after Motes previously declared Roberts led her to take the extreme measure of having gastric bypass surgery. \n \n \u201cWhen I was in high school and she was an adult, she would just let me know that I was definitely overweight,\u201d Motes told the New York Daily News last year. \n \n \u201cShe would make it quite clear to me and in a not-so-nice a manner.\u201d \n \n PHOTOS: Celebs Who Died Young \n \n In tweets that have since been deleted, Motes wrote on Jan. 19 under the handle @Dabbs76, \u201cSo my \u2018sister\u2019 said that with all her friends & fans she doesn\u2019t need anymore love. Just so you all know \u2018America\u2019s Sweetheart\u2019 is a B\u2014-H!!\u2019\u201d \n \n She later added, \u201cDo you want to be a fan of someone so cruel? She\u2019s not even that good of an actress. Happy you totally F\u2014ed with me?\u201d \n \n The family insider revealed to Radar that Roberts, 46, made arrangements for her troubled sister to check into a first class rehab facility last year. \n \n \u201cShe had agreed to go\u2026 this was about a year ago,\u201d the source said. \n \n PHOTOS: Heroin Addicts, Coke Fiends & Celebrity Stoners \u2014 Hollywood Drug Dealers Tell All! \n \n \u201cAt the last minute, Nancy backed out, gave no reason. Yet, Julia told Nancy if she was ready to get healthy, all she had to do was call. Julia never got that call.\u201d \n \n On Monday, Roberts\u2019 rep released a statement announcing the death of her Motes, as the August: Osage County star withdrew from a number of professional commitments in the wake of the family tragedy, including appearances Monday at a pre-Academy Award luncheon and one on Jimmy Kimmel. \n \n \u201cThere is no official report from the Coroner\u2019s office yet,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe family is both shocked and devastated.\u201d \n \n Nearly Unrecognizable! 20 Shocking Photos Of Stars Without Makeup \n \n Added our source: Julia is taking the death very hard. It\u2019s extremely difficult for her because it didn\u2019t have to happen. Julia has a great support network around her and she is relying on her husband [Danny Moder], more now than ever.\u201d \n \n The star\u2019s younger sibling was also half-sister to Eric Roberts and aunt to American Horror Story actress, Emma Roberts. \n \n If you, or anyone you know, is struggling with thoughts of suicide, please immediately seek help.

    "document": "A high court ruling blocking extradition to the US of Lauri Love, a student accused of breaking into US government websites, has been welcomed by lawyers and human rights groups as a precedent for trying hacking suspects in the UK in future. \n \n The decision delivered by the lord chief justice, Lord Burnett of Maldon, is highly critical of the conditions Love would have endured in US jails, warning of the risk of suicide. \n \n Lawyers for the 33-year-old, who lives in Suffolk, had argued that Love should be tried in Britain for allegedly hacking into US government websites and that he would be at risk of killing himself if sent to the US. \n \n There was cheering and applause in court on Monday when Burnett announced his decision. He asked supporters to be quiet, saying: \u201cThis is a court, not a theatre.\u201d \n \n In his judgment, Burnett said: \u201cIt would not be oppressive to prosecute Mr Love in England for the offences alleged against him. Far from it. Much of Mr Love\u2019s argument was based on the contention that this is indeed where he should be prosecuted. \n \n \u201cThe CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] must now bend its endeavours to his prosecution, with the assistance to be expected from the authorities in the United States, recognising the gravity of the allegations in this case, and the harm done to the victims.\u201d \n \n The court heard evidence from psychiatrists who work in the US prison system and questioned the adequacy of safeguarding procedures in US prisons. \n \n \n \n The CPS, which acts on behalf of the US authorities in the case, said it would read the judgment before deciding whether or not to appeal. It has 14 days to decide whether or not to appeal to the supreme court. \n \n Emerging from the front of the court afterwards, Love said: \u201cThis is not just for myself. I hope this sets a precedent for the future for anyone in the same position that they will be tried here.\u201d \n \n At a press conference later, he added: \u201cI am greatly relieved that I\u2019m no longer facing the prospect of being locked up in a country I have never visited. This legal struggle has defined my life for the past four years. I\u2019m not looking forward to be being prosecuted but I think there\u2019s a better chance that it will be done justly and fairly in the UK.\u201d \n \n Keyboard warrior: the British hacker fighting for his life Read more \n \n Love, who holds joint British and Finnish nationality, has Asperger syndrome and severe depression.

He also praised Theresa May for devising the legal test that prevented Love\u2019s removal. \n \n \n \n Nick Vamos, a solicitor at the law firm Peters and Peters and a former CPS extradition specialist, said: \u201cThis judgment will mean that US and UK prosecutors will need to be very careful in future about how they decide who should prosecute cases of concurrent jurisdiction, and will have to focus far more than previously on a suspect\u2019s connections to the UK.\u201d \n \n ||||| Lauri Love smiles as he leaves with parents Alexander Love, left, Sirkka-Liisa Love, second left, and girlfriend Sylvia Mann, from The Royal Courts of Justice in London, Monday, Feb. 5, 2018.

In a central London court decision, the judges ruled Love should stay in the UK. \n \n In their full judgement, the lord chief justice Ian Burnett and justice Duncan Ouseley discharged Love's order for extradition. \n \n Advertisement \n \n The judges ruled that Love's extradition would be \"oppressive\" due to his health conditions and it would be likely that he would be kept in solitary confinement in the US prison system. The new decision by the judges overrules Westminster Magistrates' court in late 2016, which said Love should go to the US. \n \n Love, who lives near Newmarket, is accused of hacking US government bodies and intelligence agencies in 2012 and 2013. He could have faced up to 99 years in prison and a potential fine of up to $9 million (\u00a36.3m) if he was extradited. \n \n Read next Friday briefing: Details of 150 million MyFitnessPal accounts stolen in breach Friday briefing: Details of 150 million MyFitnessPal accounts stolen in breach \n \n However, Love lives with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome and has a history of depression, and has argued his medical situation means he shouldn't be extradited to the US to face any potential trial. Love has publicly stated he would take his own life if he was forced to go abroad. His legal team has argued he should face trial in the UK instead of being extradited. \n \n \"The support of his family, in particular, would mean that he would be at far lower a risk of suicide,\" if he was to stay in the UK, the judges said. Their ruling continued to say that there is \"no satisfactory and sufficiently specific evidence\" that treatments would be available in the US for Love. \n \n Despite the ruling, the judges said the UK's Crown Prosecution Service should \"bend its endeavours\" to prosecute Love over the charges he faces. Any potential prosecution should be done in accordance with US authorities. \"If proven, these are serious offences indeed,\" the ruling says. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Police working for the National Crime Agency first arrested Love, in Suffolk, in 2013. He was not charged until 2015 when he was arrested on behalf of the US government and faced with the threat of extradition. \n \n Upon hearing the decision campaign group Liberty said it is important that a vulnerable person like Love should face trial where a possible criminal offence was committed. \"We are delighted that the court has today recognised Lauri\u2019s vulnerability, close family connections to the UK and the potentially catastrophic consequences of extraditing him,\" Emma Norton the head of legal casework said. \n \n Read next Pro-life bots and trolls are gearing up to sway Ireland's abortion vote Pro-life bots and trolls are gearing up to sway Ireland's abortion vote \n \n \"This was always a case that could have been prosecuted here and it's shameful that Lauri and his family have been put through this terrible ordeal.\u201d \n \n After the ruling, Love spoke outside the court. \"I'm very thankful for all of the support that we've had, without which I don't think I would have made it this far.\" \n \n Advertisement \n \n \"This decision obviously affects my life but the reason I have gone through this ordeal is not to just to save myself from being kidnapped and locked up for 99 years in a country I have never visited,\" he said. \"But it is to set a precedent whereby this will not happen to other people in the future, if there is suspected criminality then it will be trialled here in the UK. We're hopeful that other people may be able to rely on this verdict to ensure they're more humanely treated by the justice services.\" \n \n Here's the background to Love's case. \n \n What's he charged with? \n \n It's alleged that Love was involved in #OpLastResort, run by hacking group Anonymous. The operation was a protest against the arrest of renowned programmer Aaron Swartz. (Swartz killed himself while facing charges in 2013). \n \n Read next Against a torrent of digital abuse, women are taking back control Against a torrent of digital abuse, women are taking back control \n \n Between 2012 and 2013 it is said Love belong to an Anonymous group accused of hacking into Nasa, the FBI and US Federal Reserve. A 2014 FBI legal filing says Love is allegedly a \"sophisticated hacker\" who stole sensitive personal information and made it available online. \n \n The FBI says an SQL injection was used to exploit vulnerabilities in Adobe ColdFusion and backdoors were inserted into the websites that could be exploited in the future. The website of the United States Sentencing Commission was also defaced and hosted a video created by Anonymous. \n \n Love has neither confirmed or denied any role in Operation Last Resort, as The Guardian reported in September 2017. \n \n Before this, in October 2013, the National Crime Agency arrested Love after pretending to deliver him a parcel at his parent's home. The body later issued legal proceedings telling Love to hand over passwords to his encrypted laptop but courts ruled this would not be legal and denied the NCA's request. No charges were brought by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). \n \n The legal arguments \n \n The court case Love v Government of the United States of America \u2013 which is being ruled on today \u2013 was held in the Royal Courts of Justice in November last year. The appeal was took to court by Love after he lost a court case for extradition in 2016. \n \n Read next A cyberattack on Russia wouldn't be a good move for the UK A cyberattack on Russia wouldn't be a good move for the UK \n \n In the case three months ago, Love's legal team, led by Edward Fitzgerald QC, argued that Love should not be tried in the US because of his medical conditions. \"There\u2019s a very real risk that he would commit suicide,\" The Guardian reported at the time. \"There\u2019s a virtual certainty that his condition would deteriorate.\" \n \n It was argued the stress of being removed from his family and routine would exacerbate his conditions. Fitzgerald said the case against Love could be held in the UK and there would be a \"real risk of inhuman treatment\" against Love if he was sent to the US. \n \n Judge Nina Tempia, at Westminster Magistrates' court, ruled in September 2016 (court documents) that Love should be extradited to the US. She said: there is a \"strong public interest\" in the UK upholding its extradition treaties with the US; the offences are serious; \"millions of dollars' worth of damage\" was caused by the hacks; that US officials say they can manage vulnerable people in their prison system. \n \n However Tempia's ruling said Love is \"at high risk of committing suicide\" if extradited and he is \"of good character\" and is working and studying. \n \n Ultimately, it was decided that he should be extradited as Tempia was \"satisfied his needs will be comprehensively met by the US authorities\". Two months later, in November 2016, home secretary Amber Rudd signed an order that Love should be extradited. His appeal was then launched. \n \n The change in the law \n \n Love's case has many similarities with that of hacker Gary McKinnon. In October 2012, Theresa May \u2013 the then home secretary \u2013 blocked the extradition of McKinnon to the US after a 10 year battle. He faced up to 60 years in US jail if convicted of hacking charges. \n \n Advertisement \n \n McKinnon, who has Asperger's syndrome and suffered with depression, was allowed to stay in the UK after it was found his condition would \"give rise to such a high risk of him ending his life\" that it would breach his human rights. \n \n May also introduced a forum bar. \"This will mean that where prosecution is possible in both the UK and in another state, the British courts will be able to bar prosecution overseas if they believe it is in the interests of justice to do so,\" she said at the time. \n \n The forum bar exists under section 83A of the Extradition Act 20013. It allows judges to block extradition to the US and other countries if a crime was committed in the UK and if it is in the accused's interests to stand trial in the UK. Essentially, the addition to the law ensured that government ministers would not have to make any final decisions on an extradition case when it comes to human rights grounds. Speaking ahead of Love's trial one of his lawyers, Karen Todner, said if the forum bar is successful \"the UK police will have a green light to take more prosecutions here and not bow to the US pressure to extradite\".",
    "summary": "\u2013 A 33-year-old British man who allegedly hacked into the FBI, NASA, and Federal Reserve and did millions of dollars worth of damage as a form of protest in 2012 and 2013 won't be stepping foot on US soil anytime soon. The High Court of London decided against extradition on Monday, with the Guardian reporting that it agreed with the two arguments his lawyers put forth as part of Love's appeal against extradition: That he could be prosecuted in the UK, and that Love, who has Asperger's and depression, could end up killing himself while in US custody. The AP reports the judges felt his suicide risk would be lessened if he was jailed in England, where family and friends would be accessible to him. The BBC and Wired quote Love as saying \"the reason I have gone through this ordeal is not to just to save myself from being kidnapped and locked up for 99 years in a country I have never visited,\" but that he hoped his case set a \"precedent so this will not happen to people in the future. ... I'm hoping that this outcome can contribute to the discussion we are having as a society about how to accommodate people that have neuro-diversity, whose brains are made up in a slightly different way.\" Wired notes that Love would have faced up to 99 years and a fine of up to $9 million were he convicted in US courts. As for prospects of being tried on his own shore, the judges in their ruling \"emphasize ... that it would not be oppressive to prosecute Mr. Love in England for the offences alleged against him.\"",

    "document": "With Verizon\u2019s long-anticipated bid to buy Yahoo finally official, speculation turns to what happens to the Internet giant\u2019s CEO, Marissa Mayer. \n \n In a Tumblr post, Mayer wrote on Monday, \u201cI\u2019m planning to stay... It\u2019s important to me to see Yahoo into its next chapter,\u201d a position she reiterated in a CNBC interview Monday morning, although she also said she was \u201copen minded\u201d about the future. \n \n Play Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Embed Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer in the hot seat as company struggles 2:24 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \n \n For some, this indicates that the onetime Google wunderkind might depart after the deal is finished in the first quarter of next year. \n \n \u201cIt might be for a short period,\u201d Morningstar equity analyst Ali Mogharabi said of the prospect of Mayer\u2019s staying on. \u201cThey might need her input during the integration process.\u201d \n \n After that, though, all bets are off. \n \n RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney said he expected AOL chief Tim Armstrong to lead the combined AOL-Yahoo company, calling him \u201ca very seasoned internet executive,\u201d in the CNBC interview. \u201cHe\u2019s the right person to be running the combined assets,\u201d Mahaney said. \n \n Ultimately, staying at Yahoo might not be Mayer\u2019s choice to make, pointed out Scott Kessler, equity analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence. \n \n \u201cShe started out with just so much interest and enthusiasm and and excitement\u2026 and the last year or two have been tremendously disappointing,\u201d he said. \n \n Since being tapped to run Yahoo in 2012 after a scandal involving previous CEO Scott Thompson misrepresenting his credentials, Mayer initially boosted her standing with workers by bringing in Google-style staff perks like free lunch and phones. \n \n Her elimination of telecommuting in 2013 was less well received, though. Aside from running counter to the typical Silicon Valley corporate culture, which tends to encourage remote work, some charged that Yahoo\u2019s ban was unfair to working parents, especially since it was widely reported that Mayer had a nursery built near her office to accommodate the baby boy she had a few months after taking the top spot at Yahoo. Mayer\u2019s two-week maternity leaves, both in 2012 as well as three years later, when she had twin girls, also sparked a larger conversation about parental leave in the tech industry. \n \n \u201cShe has become the face of Yahoo, for better or worse. She has become a lightning rod,\u201d Kessler said. \n \n Some of her choices when it came to Yahoo\u2019s operations were also questioned, especially as the promised turnaround failed to materialize. \n \n Read More: Yahoo to Lay Off 15 Percent of Workforce, Revamp Company \n \n \u201cI would say it\u2019s pretty much a mixed bag,\u201d Mogharabi said. \u201cThe acquisition of Brightroll was a good one,\u201d he said of Yahoo\u2019s 2014 purchase of the ad platform, but he pointed out that its 2013 purchase of microblogging platform Tumblr for $1.1 billion didn\u2019t pay off the way the company hoped. \n \n \u201cWhile Marissa stabilized Yahoo during her tenure, she missed on the big trends,\u201d Constellation Research founder and principal analyst R \u201cRay\u201d Wang said via email. \u201cMost folks would expect Marissa to leave within a year,\u201d he noted. \n \n Leaving could be lucrative for Mayer. According to Equilar, a compensation data and research firm, she will make just under $57 million if Verizon decides not to keep her on. Through the end of last year, Equilar estimates that Mayer earned nearly $219 million, including $115 million in \u201crealized pay,\u201d which includes her cash earnings, value of shares vested during her tenure and gains from exercising options. \n \n That kind of money would give Mayer enough breathing room to take some time deliberating her next moves, which might be the best plan for her, Kessler suggested. \n \n \u201cI think she would benefit from some time between what she\u2018s doing now and what she\u2019s going to do next,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of options out there for her.\u201d ||||| Marissa Mayer hits out at 'gender bias' as Yahoo is sold for $5bn \n \n Verizon agreed to buy Yahoo\u2019s core internet business for $4.83bn (\u00a33.62bn) in cash on Monday, marking the final chapter in the struggling fortunes of the fading web pioneer. \n \n Marissa Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive officer, has faced a barrage of criticism over her tenure. She hit out at \u201cgender-charged\u201d reporting in an interview with the Financial Times after the sale. \n \n \u201cI\u2019ve tried to be gender-blind and believe tech is a gender-neutral zone but do think there has been gender-charged reporting,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all see the things that only plague women leaders, like articles that focus on their appearance, like Hillary Clinton sporting a new pantsuit. I think all women are aware of that, but I had hoped in 2015 and 2016 that I would see fewer articles like that. It\u2019s a shame.\u201d \n \n Verizon, the US\u2019s largest telecommunications company by subscribers, will combine Yahoo with another fallen giant of the first internet age, AOL, which it bought last year for $4.4bn. \n \n By the numbers: why big-name businesses are bidding for Yahoo Read more \n \n After the deal, expected to be complete in 2017, Yahoo will be left as a holding company for its valuable stakes in web businesses in China and Japan. Yahoo has a 15% stake in the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba and a 35.5% interest in Yahoo Japan. \n \n \u201cThe sale of our operating business, which effectively separates our Asian asset equity stakes, is an important step in our plan to unlock shareholder value for Yahoo,\u201d Mayer said in a statement on Monday. \n \n Founded in a Stanford University dorm room in 1994 by Jerry Yang and David Filo as \u201cJerry and David\u2019s Guide To The World Wide Web\u201d, Yahoo grew rapidly through the 1990s to become one of the pre-eminent internet companies of its generation. \n \n Offering email, news, shopping and search, Yahoo went public in 1996, with its share price soaring 154% on day one. In January 2000, Yahoo was valued at $125bn. But the company failed to keep pace with the changing tech landscape as Google came to dominate search and Facebook social media. \n \n Microsoft launched a $44.6bn hostile bid for Yahoo in 2008. On Monday, the company was valued at $37bn while Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, was valued at $518bn and Facebook at $349bn. \n \n The new generation of tech companies have also outstripped Yahoo. Mayer\u2019s company may still have more than one billion active monthly users but Verizon\u2019s price is less than a quarter of Snapchat\u2019s current valuation. \n \n \n \n Yahoo will continue as an independent company until the deal receives shareholder and regulatory approval, the companies said. \n \n The sale is an ignominious end to Mayer\u2019s plans to turn Yahoo around. Mayer, a highly rated Google executive, joined Yahoo in July 2012. Before her arrival the company was in disarray and had had four CEOs in three years. \n \n Mayer promised a \u201crenewed focus on product innovation to drive user experience and advertising revenue\u201d. But shareholders lost faith in her after a wild spending spree in which she tried to build Yahoo\u2019s content business by adding the blog site Tumblr, for $1.1bn, and signed deals with TV news anchor Katie Couric and the National Football League that failed to pay off. \n \n In a Tumblr blogpost, Mayer said she planned to stay at Yahoo, but Verizon\u2019s Marni Walden, who will head the combined company, told CNBC the new leadership team had yet to be determined. \n \n Should Mayer be forced out, she is in for a payoff of $137m. Yahoo\u2019s boss has already taken home $78m since she was installed as CEO, according to the stock analytics firm MSCI. Based on the terms of the company\u2019s most recent proxy statement, she will take home another $59m if she\u2019s dismissed from the company after a buyout. \n \n Some commentators were skeptical about the combined power of AOL and Yahoo. John Colley, a professor at Warwick Business School, said the merger was an alliance of two weak companies unlikely to form a single strong one. \u201cTechnology history is littered with the remnants of once all-powerful businesses \u2013 take Nokia and RIM, makers of the Blackberry,\u201d Colley said. He said it was difficult to see how Verizon would benefit from this acquisition. \n \n The sale does not include Yahoo\u2019s cash, its shares in Alibaba, its shares in Yahoo Japan, Yahoo\u2019s convertible notes, certain minority investments and Yahoo\u2019s non-core patents. \n \n \n \n The Alibaba and Yahoo Japan investments are worth about $40bn, while Yahoo had a market value of about $37.4bn as of Friday\u2019s close. \n \n Verizon prevailed over rival bidders for Yahoo, including AT&T; a group led by the Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert and backed by the billionaire Warren Buffett; the private equity firm TPG Capital; and a consortium of buyout firms, Vector Capital and Sycamore Partners. \n \n The telecoms company is hoping that a combined AOL and Yahoo will create a strong third player to compete with Alphabet and Facebook for online revenues. \n \n Reuters contributed to this article",
    "summary": "\u2013 Marissa Mayer says coverage of her four years at the helm of Yahoo has been \"gender charged.\" \"We all see the things that only plague women leaders, like articles that focus on their appearance, like Hillary Clinton sporting a new pantsuit,\" she tells the Financial Times. \"I think all women are aware of that, but I had hoped in 2015 and 2016 that I would see fewer articles like that. It\u2019s a shame.\" It was announced Monday that Verizon would acquire the struggling Internet pioneer for $4.83 billion, which, per the Guardian, puts an \"ignominious end to Mayer\u2019s plans to turn Yahoo around.\" Mayer has been oft-criticized for how she has run Yahoo, with much of the criticism centering on \"bad acquisitions and poor hires,\" per the Times, such as buying Tumblr for $1.1 billion\u2014part of what the Guardian calls a \"wild spending spree.\" In a post on that platform, Mayer writes, \"I\u2019m planning to stay. I love Yahoo, and I believe in all of you. It\u2019s important to me to see Yahoo into its next chapter.\" But how long that will be remains to be seen. \"It might be for a short period,\" an analyst tells NBC news. \"They might need her input during the integration process.\"",

    "document": "Person who's here, Scout Willis, floated through the Lower East Side like a topless ghost Tuesday afternoon, scouting locations where nipples are welcome. So far the list consists of: New York City; not Instagram. \n \n Willis, daughter of Bruce and Demi Moore, posted two images of her topless promenade to Twitter, using the hashtag #FreeTheNipple in protest of Instagram's censorship policy regarding female nudity. (An image of the topless magazine cover that got singer Rihanna's Instagram account suspended in April currently serves as Willis' Twitter avatar.) \n \n In one image, a shirtless Willis walks away from a fabric store. She has no use for fabric; her skin is her fabric and her nipples are two gemstone embellishments placed symmetrically on the front of her head-to-toe bodysuit. This photo Willis has captioned \"What @instagram won't let you see #FreeTheNipple.\" \n \n In the other photo, Willis touches flowers, though it is unclear if she intends to purchase them. \"Legal in NYC but not on @instagram,\" writes Willis. (She is referring to bare nipples in the street.) \n \n Legal in NYC but not on @instagram pic.twitter.com/YX9BymV6R6 \u2014 Scout LaRue Willis (@Scout_Willis) 2014. M\u00e1jus 27. \n \n Previous supporters of the Free The Nipple movement include Miley Cyrus and Cara Delevingne. \n \n [h/t TMZ // Image via @Scout_Willis on Twitter] ||||| Scout Willis, the daughter of Demi Moore and Bruce Willis, thought Instagram was behaving like a giant boob when the site took down one of her photos, citing a violation of community guidelines. So she decided to retaliate by showing her own, taking a topless stroll around Manhattan to protest Instagram\u2019s anti-nudity policy. \n \n Via Scout Willis/Twitter \n \n On Tuesday, Willis tweeted photos of herself using the hashtag #freethenipple. The pictures, taken by professional photog Mario Sorrenti, were captioned \u201cLegal in NYC but not on @instagram\u201d and \u201cWhat @Instagram won\u2019t let you see.\u201d \n \n Public female toplessness has been legal in New York City since 1992. But while it\u2019s legal for women to bare their breasts outdoors, police continue to arrest them. \n \n A documentary film, Free the Nipple, is about the fight against these censorship laws in New York City. The MPAA, of course, limited its exposure by giving the film a NC-17 rating. Spurred on by a topless Miley Cyrus, a hashtag in support of the film, #freethenipple, popped up in late 2013. \n \n Willis\u2019s crusade against Instagram\u2019s prudishness appears to have started last week, when Instagram removed a photo of a sweatshirt she designed that featured an image of two topless models. She was, to put it mildly, displeased: \n \n Made a new Instagram,gonna post lots of beautiful photos of naked women I think.Tasteful, non aggressive, whomever wants to see can, if not \u2014 Scout LaRue Willis (@Scout_Willis) May 27, 2014 \n \n Not even 24 hours before getting kicked off again.... pic.twitter.com/J4iGB2r2Jz \u2014 Scout LaRue Willis (@Scout_Willis) May 27, 2014 \n \n A) fine\ud83d\udc4c B) got flagged and removed from @instagram pic.twitter.com/IZ80lrXJRc \u2014 Scout LaRue Willis (@Scout_Willis) May 27, 2014 \n \n @instagram pictures of breast cancer survivors have been flagged+deleted but this is super #sick and #hot amiright??? pic.twitter.com/zMRvftipfg \u2014 Scout LaRue Willis (@Scout_Willis) May 27, 2014 \n \n Since then, Willis has been on a nonstop quest to get Instagram to acknowledge the existence of breasts, specifically her own. She\u2019s been sharing photos of breasts. She\u2019s been tweeting about breasts. She even changed her middle name on Instagram to \u201cAreola.\u201d (Her account is currently disabled). \n \n But it wasn\u2019t until she stripped down on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side that her quest to bare breasts on social media started getting real attention. From the looks of her Twitter, most people are applauding her efforts, tweeting in support of her cause. \n \n For now, Willis is still furiously tweeting at Instagram in protest of their anti-nudity policy. When I asked her if they had responded yet on Twitter, she was just as succinct as she was, er, topless that one time: \n \n \u201c@ej_dickson: Hi @Scout_Willis have you heard from Instagram since your protest?\u201d No \u2014 Scout LaRue Willis (@Scout_Willis) May 28, 2014 \n \n H/T Mirror UK | Photo via Scout Willis/Twitter ||||| Gwen Stefani spotted leaving a skin care clinic while out and about in Beverly Hills, California on June 2. \n \n Halle Berry attended the Huading Film Awards on June 1 at Ricardo Montalban Theatre in Los Angeles, California. \n \n Kim Kardashian was seen at LAX on June 1 in Los Angeles, California. \n \n Shailene Woodley was seen leaving the Bowery Hotel in New York City on June 1. \n \n Marion Cotillard spotted out and about with a friend in New York City on June 1. \n \n Khloe Kardashian chatted away on her cell phone as she arrived on a red eye flight at JFK airport in New York on May 31. \n \n Naomi Watts headed to the gym for a morning workout on May 30 in Brentwood, California \n \n Jane Lynch signed copies of her book \"Marlene, Marlene, Queen of Mean\" at the 2014 Bookexpo America at The Jacob K.

However, I don't wish to force this view on anyone. \u2014 Scout LaRue Willis (@Scout_Willis) May 27, 2014 \n \n Scout Willis is on a mission to bare it all.The 22-year-old daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore walked around New York City while topless on Tuesday, sharing photos of her promenade to protest Instagram's nudity policy. The social media site has come under fire for deleting pictures of breast cancer survivors and women breastfeeding.\"Legal in NYC but not on @instagram,\" she Tweeted along with a photo of her shopping for flowers wearing only a skirt.\"What @instagram won't let you see #FreeTheNipple,\" she added along with another daring photo.The model and actress even changed her Instagram name to \"Scout (Areola) Willis\" \u2013 before her account was deleted.Willis isn't the only celebrity to protest Instagram. Rihanna 's account was deleted after the singer posted a racy magazine cover featuring an image of her topless.According to Instagram's basic terms of service , \"You may not post violent, nude, partially nude, discriminatory, unlawful, infringing, hateful, pornographic or sexually suggestive photos or other content.\"",
    "summary": "\u2013 Scout Willis spent Tuesday walking around Manhattan, sans top, while a professional photographer followed her around taking pictures, which Willis then tweeted with the hashtag #freethenipple. Why? She's mad at Instagram. Willis, Bruce and Demi's 22-year-old kid, had one of her photos removed by the picture-sharing site last week because it included two topless models, which Instagram said violated its community guidelines. So Willis started sharing all sorts of pictures of breasts and changed her middle name on the site to \"Areola\" (sic), though you can't see that right now because her account is disabled, the Daily Dot reports. She then took to Twitter, posting pictures of her topless stroll with the captions \"Legal in NYC but not on @instagram\" and \"What @Instagram won\u2019t let you see.\" It is legal for women to be topless in public in New York City, though the Daily Dot notes that they are still sometimes arrested for it, and Free the Nipple is a documentary about the fight against the city's censorship laws. People notes that Willis' crusade comes after Rihanna's Instagram account was taken down after she posted topless photos from a magazine shoot, and Gawker adds that Willis' current Twitter avatar is one of those photos.

(Associated Press) \n \n FILE- In this Oct. 22, 2011 file photo, a doctor examines a pregnant woman at the district women's hospital, in Allahabad, in India's most populous state of Uttar Pradesh. India\u2019s government is advising... (Associated Press) \n \n NEW DELHI (AP) \u2014 India's government is advising pregnant women to avoid all meat, eggs and lusty thoughts. \n \n Doctors say the advice is preposterous, and even dangerous, considering India's already-poor record with maternal health. Women are often the last to eat or receive health care in traditionally patriarchal Indian households. \n \n Malnutrition and anemia, or iron deficiency, are key factors behind India's having one of the world's highest rates of maternal mortality, with 174 of every 100,000 pregnancies resulting in the mother's death in 2015. That's better than five years earlier, when the maternal mortality rate was 205 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, but still far worse than China's 27 per 100,000 or the United States' 14 per 100,000, according to UNICEF. \n \n \"The government is doling out unscientific and irrational advice, instead of ensuring that poor pregnant women get to eat a nutritious, high-protein diet,\" said gynecologist Arun Gadre, who is based in the western Indian city of Pune but works in rural areas. \n \n The government booklet, titled \"Mother and Child Care,\" smacks of religious dogma and ignores widely accepted medical evidence that pregnant women benefit from eating protein-rich meats and can safely engage in sex, doctors said. \n \n It says pregnant women should also shun \"impure thoughts\" and look at pictures of beautiful babies to benefit the fetus. \n \n \"Pregnant women should detach themselves from desire, anger, attachment, hatred and lust,\" reads the booklet, released last week by the Central Council for Research in Yoga and Naturopathy, a part of the government's ministry that promotes traditional and alternative medicine. \n \n The traditional medicine minister defended the booklet as containing \"wisdom accumulated over many centuries,\" and said it did not advise specifically against sex, only against all thoughts of desire or lust. \n \n \"The booklet puts together relevant facts culled out from clinical practice in the fields of yoga and naturopathy,\" Minister Shripad Naik said. \n \n The advice is unlikely to be followed at the many government-run health centers across India. They are operated by the Health Ministry, which has had past conflicts with the traditional medicine ministry and follows more scientific practices. \n \n The booklet is the latest push for vegetarianism by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-nationalist government, which already advocates avoiding beef and strictly limits the transportation and slaughter of cows, which are considered sacred by Hindus. \n \n But the latest homily to pregnant women has outraged the medical community. \n \n \"This is a national shame. If the calories of expectant mothers are further reduced by asking them to shun meat and eggs, this situation will only worsen,\" Gadre said. \"This is absurd advice to be giving to pregnant women in a country like India.\" \n \n About a third of India's 1.3 billion people struggle to live on less than $2 a day. Many are lucky to eat more than one full meal a day, and women often give their portions up to their hungry children or husbands. \n \n Malnourished women are more likely to give birth to underweight babies, who then are in danger of being \"stunted\" or not growing to their full height and weight. A full 48 percent of all Indian children under the age of 5 are considered stunted, according to a 2015 report by UNICEF. \n \n \"Undernourished girls grow into undernourished women. Married by their families while still in their teens, these girls become pregnant by the time they are 17 or 18, when their bodies have not matured enough to safely deliver a child,\" said Amit Sengupta, a physician and health care activist with the Delhi Science Forum, a public advocacy organization. \n \n He said the government's advice to pregnant women betrayed \"backward thinking\" and hostility toward evidence-based science. \n \n \"This kind of advice is detrimental to women's health,\" he said.",
    "summary": "\u2013 A government pamphlet's advice for pregnant women in India isn't going over well. The booklet titled \"Mother and Child Care\" tells the women to \"detach themselves from desire, anger, attachment, hatred and lust,\" spurn \"impure thoughts,\" look at \"beautiful pictures\" to benefit their fetus, and avoid meat and eggs, per the AP and Hindustan Times. According to one gynecologist in India, the advice isn't just \"unscientific and irrational,\" but it's \"a national shame\" in a country where 174 of every 100,000 pregnancies resulted in the mother's death in 2015, due in part to malnutrition and anemia. That's compared to 14 deaths per 100,000 pregnancies in the US, according to UNICEF.

But \"if the calories of expectant mothers are further reduced by asking them to shun meat and eggs, this situation will only worsen,\" Gadre says.

Cars, washing machines, all of it.\" \n \n On how he'd punish Muammar Qadhafi: \"I'd make him marry Brooke and Denise.\u201d \n \n Sheen was referring to Denise Richards, whom he divorced in 2006, and Brooke Mueller, from whom he's estranged. The start time of Sheen's show was delayed an hour thanks to his mandated court appearance at a Los Angeles court Tuesday where Sheen lost custody of his twins with Mueller. \"Hope you had a better f\u2014king day than I did,\" joked Sheen. \"Sorry, I'm late.\" \n \n Sheen wasn't the only head turner at DAR on Tuesday: Tareq and Michaele Salahi were there to take in the show and enjoyed plenty of posing with fans. POLITICO caught up with them before the show to get their take on Sheen. ||||| Correction: Earlier versions of this article misspelled the name of reality-TV personality Tareq Salahi. This version has been corrected. \n \n A couple of thousand people were held hostage by Charlie Sheen\u2019s ego Tuesday night in an auditorium named after the female descendants of the American Revolution, half a mile from the World War II Memorial in the capital of the free world. This prompts an icky existential question: If the abusive ex-star of a CBS sitcom can compel a legion of citizens to pay $104.25 apiece to be doused in cultural bile, is the free world a little too free? \n \n The answer, of course, is no. Mostly no. No, except for the five seconds after Sheen seemed to imply that he believes President Obama wasn\u2019t born in the United States, triggering boisterous applause from the mostly young, near-capacity crowd at the 3,700-seat DAR Constitution Hall. Sheen seemed to toy with the idea of running for president (with Nicolas Cage) and noted that his birth certificate was not \u201cPhotoshopped.\u201d \n \n The man has become so unreadable that it was hard to tell whether he was joking or serious. He was, though, noncommittal about running and occasionally circumspect. \n \n \u201cEvery day is just one day,\u201d Sheen said at the top of the show. \u201cTomorrow is not here yet.\u201d \n \n It was the end of a long day for Sheen, who deployed his lawyers to two court hearings in Southern California on Tuesday morning, charioted himself in a black Rolls-Royce to the Van Nuys Airport that afternoon, and blazed across the continent in a private jet to walk onstage 67 minutes late for his show in downtown Washington, the halfway point in his 20-city tour titled \u201cViolent Torpedo of Truth: Defeat Is Not an Option,\u201d a kind of Sherman\u2019s March of the male libido. \n \n Washington as a whole greeted Sheen with a feisty, inebriated bear hug, but there was some wonky thoughtfulness in the crowd. \n \n \u201cI came here to see Charlie Sheen on an extended loop and be both horrified and entertained,\u201d said a 34-year-old lobbyist who declined to give her name because she\u2019s a \u201cprofessional girl\u201d who \u201ccares about my future.\u201d \n \n \u201cNot often can you see a public figure implode in front of your eyes \u2014 usually you can only see that through the media,\u201d said her 40-year-old lobbyist friend, who was also too embarrassed to be identified. \n \n \u201cWe perpetuate this image that is fake and a lie, and we put it on television,\u201d railed a TV reporter into her cellphone \u2014 presumably to an editor \u2014 as she prepared to do a spot from outside the venue before the show started. \u201cThat\u2019s how I feel as a journalist.\u201d \n \n Me, too, but here\u2019s the straightest scoop deliverable: The show began with a stream-of-consciousness monologue about Sheen\u2019s hatred of ex-wives and his failure to secure sole custody of his children earlier in the day. It lurched onward to a dry sit-down interview \u2014 led by much-booed WBIG (100.3 FM) host Tommy Griffiths \u2014 about the first time Sheen met Marlon Brando. The crowd quaked with catcalls whenever Sheen wasn\u2019t talking about doing drugs or manhandling women. \n \n \u201cENTERTAIN US,\u201d boomed a male voice as Sheen waxed philosophical on the hard living of Dennis Hopper. \n \n \u201cSHUT THE [EXPLETIVE] UP AND SAY SOMETHING WEIRD,\u201d demanded another. \n \n It has been less than two months since Sheen outed himself as a warlock who is capable of ingesting \u201cepic\u201d amounts of cocaine, vanquishing addiction with his superhuman mind, shrugging off his nearly $2 million-an-episode job with Warner Bros. and orating on national television about the vague, seemingly mutable bylaws of nature and space-time (Google \u201cwinning\u201d and \u201ctiger blood\u201d and \u201cAdonis DNA\u201d and so on). \n \n In the first week or so of his renaissance (or breakdown, depending on your standards), it seemed as if Sheen was onto something, as if he were imbued with a spiritual clarity reserved for prophets, as if he were pulverizing and remolding the very notion of celebrity. \n \n That notion of celebrity now seems to belong to his audiences \u2014 or at least the one at DAR, whose restlessness guided the rhythms of the show and whose outbursts were often more entertaining than the ramblings of Sheen or his better-received guest, stand-up comic Jeff Ross. \n \n \u201cCuriosity about exploitation\u201d was why 33-year-old Arlington salesman Johnny Champane came with three friends at the last minute. \u201cExploitation of himself.

Until then, we are taking extra care in managing our cash,\" Deputy Finance Minister Christos Staikouras told Real News weekly. \n \n The troika of EU, European Central Bank and IMF lenders, whose departure date is now uncertain, is due to return in September to complete its assessment of whether Greece deserves more aid. \n \n A fifth year of recession, record unemployment, and repeated waves of austerity cuts have fuelled growing anger towards the troika and the austerity medicine it has insisted on. \n \n Summing up the dark public mood, the GSEE union lambasted the troika after talks with it on Friday for heaping misery on Greeks. \n \n \"We agreed on one thing - that we disagree on everything,\" GSEE leader Yannis Panagopoulos said in a statement. \"The troika men came to Greece as doctors and prescribed the medicine that would save the Greek economy and people, but in the end they proved to be charlatans.\" \n \n (Writing by Deepa Babington; Editing by Tim Pearce) ||||| Germany's finance minister says he can't see room for further concessions to Greece and is insisting anew that the country must implement far-reaching reforms and cut its budget deficit. \n \n International debt inspectors are scrutinizing Greece's finances and its progress in implementing budget cuts and reforms demanded in exchange for its rescue loan program.

    "document": "GREENSBURG, Ind. -- A mom who has been behind bars since 1996 accused of murdering her toddler son in an arson fire, walked free from jail Wednesday after new evidence was presented that led a court to grant her a new trial. \n \n A sheriff led Kristine Bunch, wearing a new dress and black patent leather shoes and carrying her prison clothes in a Wal-Mart bag, out the door of the jail. He let go of her arm and then said quietly: \"You're free.\" \n \n Bunch, 38, turned down the sidewalk and went straight to her mother, Susan Hubbard. They had a long embrace. \n \n Next in line for Bunch was her son, 16-year-old Trenton, who had never visited his mother outside of prison, who has never slept under the same roof with her except for his very first night. Bunch went back to the Indiana Women's Prison the day after giving birth at a local hospital. \n \n Authorities say Bunch set fire to her mobile home in a blaze that killed her 3-year-old son, Tony. \n \n Bunch, then 22, was sentenced to 60 years. But on Wednesday, at 38, she was released, pending a new trial that was granted in March by the Indiana Court of Appeals. \n \n The Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University School of Law took up Bunch's case in 2007 and was joined in the cause by Chicago attorney Ron Safer, whose Schiff Hardin firm worked on the case at no cost. In 2009, they presented new evidence to the appeals court based, in part, on technological advances in fire investigations. \n \n The new evidence, Safer said, made it impossible for the fire to have happened the way the state alleged, that some test results the state provided were simply incorrect. In actuality, tests showed that he died of carbon monoxide poisoning, Safer said. Had the fire been set with an accelerant in the manner prosecutors alleged, he would have died from burns. \n \n On Wednesday, Senior Circuit Judge W. Michael Wilke, based on the fact that Bunch's family put up bond money for her in 1996, said the words she and her family had waited 16 years to hear: \"The defendant will be released from the Department of Corrections.\" \n \n Decatur County prosecutors were unavailable for comment. Bunch has a court appearance next week. But, Safer said, \"Today she is a free woman, and we are determined to make sure that she has spent her last day behind bars.\" \n \n Bunch said she was initially in a state of shock upon being sentenced to 60 years for arson and the murder of her son. She likened it to a bad dream that wouldn't end. Upon her release, Bunch was joyful but expressed no bitterness over a conviction she has always maintained was a mistake. \n \n \"I haven't been by myself,\" she said. \"I had a family that stood by me. I had people that believed in me and stepped up. And you can't receive blessings like that and be bitter.\" \n \n While in prison, Bunch said she took part in Kairos prison ministry and became a Catholic. She earned undergraduate degrees in English and anthropology from Ball State University. And now she has dreams of going to law school, focusing on criminal law and joining a wrongful conviction team. \n \n \"I want to give back. I've been very blessed,\" she said. \"One day I want to fight for others because others fought for me.\" \n \n First, Bunch said she wants to get reacquainted with her family. \n \n Trenton already has a long list of things he wants to do with his mom. \n \n He wants to take a trip to the zoo, go to a concert, have her watch him run track in the spring if he makes the team. \n \n \"I want to do the stuff that I should have been able to do a long time ago,\" he said, \"and never got to do.\" \n \n Initially, though, Trenton may have to help his mother navigate her 16-year time warp. When she was last free, cellphones were the size of shoeboxes, and she was amazed at the tiny devices her friends and her legal team were toting, that half the courtroom had to cough up at the judge's order before her hearing began. \n \n And then there's the Internet -- she's heard about it but never seen it. There's no access in the prison. \n \n \"My son said I'm going to teach you how to Facebook,\" she said, \"and we're going to look at the Internet.\" \n \n But Bunch also relishes the idea of much simpler pleasures. She wants to watch her son sleep. \n \n \"I've never gotten to see my son sleep except for little naps when he would come visit me,\" she said. \"I want to be able to bounce in his room all night and look at him while he's asleep.\" ||||| Women's Project \n \n Featured article by Emily Halter, CWC alum and Northwestern Pritzker School of Law 2018 graduate \n \n \"While some programs exist in the United States, for the most part, there are few avenues of support for incarcerated mothers.

In many cases, they are suspected of harming their children or other loved ones. As a result, when under investigation, they may be coping with deep personal loss, rendering them especially vulnerable to high-pressure interrogation tactics that can lead to false confessions or seemingly inculpatory statements. When women\u2014traditionally viewed as nurturers and protectors\u2014are accused of murdering or sexually abusing children, they are particularly reviled by society, including, of course, police, prosecutors, judges, jurors, and witnesses. 40% of female exonerees were convicted harming children or loved ones in their care. \n \n In cases in which no crime has occurred\u2014such as accidental or natural deaths that are mistaken for homicides\u2014the evidence is often entirely circumstantial. DNA evidence, the gold standard for exonerating the innocent, has been central to less than 3% of women's exonerations (compared to 22% of men's exonerations). In circumstantial cases, other types of forensic evidence may play an unusually large role, yet the evidence may be erroneous. More than a third of exonerated women's cases involved flawed or misleading forensic evidence. Two-thirds of female exonerees were convicted in cases in which no crime occurred. \n \n *Statistics on this webpage are derived from the National Registry of Exonerations and are reasonably current but may not be fully up to date. ||||| Center on Wrongful Convictions \n \n CWC client Tommy Ward featured in The Innocent Man, premiering on Netflix December 14, 2018 \n \n The Innocent Man Netflix series includes the story of the Center on Wrongful Convictions\u2019 client Tommy Ward.

It fanned out across the floor and climbed up the walls, then formed an impassable barrier across the middle of the trailer. Bunch, 21, snapped awake in the living room. Her three-year-old son, Tony, shrieked for her on the other side of the flames. \n \n Bunch staggered outside and howled for a neighbor. She bashed Tony's window with a tricycle. As the flames lashed 30 feet into the dawn sky, a fire engine tore up to the house. A firefighter, crawling on his belly, found Tony's charred body in the bedroom. \n \n Bunch told police she had no idea what caused the fire. Soon, though, arson investigators determined that a liquid accelerant such as kerosene or lighter fluid had been poured in Tony's bedroom and the living room. Police arrested Bunch on charges of arson and felony murder. Eight months later, Bunch went on trial. By then, she was 22 and unexpectedly pregnant with a second child. The evidence against her seemed overwhelming. Two arson investigators gave compelling testimony for the prosecution, and the jury took only a few hours to convict her on both counts. \n \n At sentencing, Bunch recalled, the judge sneered down at her belly. \n \n \"I understand that you have arranged to have yourself impregnated,\" he said. \"You thought it would work to your advantage somehow in this process. It will not. You will not raise that child.\" \n \n The judge gave her the maximum sentence: 60 years. \n \n \n \n Karen Daniel and Judy Royal are obsessed with people like Bunch. \n \n During their nearly 30 combined years at the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University Law School, the two lawyers have helped exonerate more than two dozen people once found guilty of horrendous crimes. Most of the people they have freed are men; just four are women. And for a long time, Daniel and Royal thought that disparity made perfect sense. Men are convicted of crimes, especially violent crimes, at much higher rates than are women. So it follows that most people exonerated of crimes are also men: The National Registry of Exonerations, a University of Michigan Law School database that has cataloged information on more than 1,600 exonerations nationwide since 1989, includes just 148 women. \n \n About three years ago, however, Daniel and Royal began to question whether that number was too low. Women make up about 11 percent of the people convicted of violent crimes, but just 6 percent of those exonerated of violent crimes. At the urging of a former client, Julie Rea Harper\u2014who spent four years in prison for the murder of her son before a serial killer confessed to the crime\u2014Daniel and Royal decided to try to figure out if there was anything that set exonerated women apart. \n \n They started by looking at the few women whose cases they had worked on themselves. \"I haven't had any men's cases that looked like these four cases,\" Daniel recalls thinking. \"Could that really be a coincidence?\" \n \n After three years of pursuing that question, Daniel and Royal have concluded that most innocence projects\u2014including their own legal clinic\u2014are failing to bring justice to wrongly convicted women. They have identified factors that make female clients more difficult to exonerate, and uncovered startling facts that distinguish the cases of wrongly convicted women from those of men. And they have launched a project that could change how the American innocence movement helps these women get justice. \n \n \n \n Daniel and Royal started by digging deep into the exonerations database. Their first insight had to do with DNA evidence\u2014the very breakthrough that launched the innocence movement a quarter century ago. \"Women tend not to be convicted of the types of crimes that can be overturned based on the results of DNA testing,\" Daniel explained. Men perpetrate the overwhelming majority of rapes and murders of strangers. These crimes are much more likely to leave behind DNA evidence that can rule out an innocent suspect, or point to the real rapist or killer. \n \n But when women kill, they usually kill someone close to them. And in most of those cases, DNA isn't relevant. When a woman is suspected of killing her husband or her child, investigators are likely to find her DNA all over the crime scene whether she's guilty or innocent\u2014so DNA testing can do little to exonerate her. Sure enough, 27 percent of the men in the exonerations registry were freed using DNA evidence. The same was true of only 7.6 percent of the women. \n \n Yet many exoneration projects, including the original Innocence Project founded in 1992, only work with convicts who can be absolved through DNA. Because courts consider DNA tests definitive and trustworthy, genetic evidence is often the most effective way to overturn a wrongful conviction. Innocence projects have tended to avoid cases in which the offender knew the victim, because it can be hard to disentangle what happened in a domestic crime. In some cases, Daniel said, \"you almost have to look into that person's brain to know what happened.\" About half the women in the registry went to prison for harming someone in their care. \n \n But reliance on DNA and aversion to domestic cases weren't the only hurdles for wrongly convicted women. In a whopping 63 percent of the women's cases, Daniel and Royal realized, it turned out that there was never a crime to begin with\u2014the death was actually a suicide or an accident. That was true in only 21 percent of the men's cases. \n \n This was a critical discovery. The tools innocence projects rely on are designed to solve crimes. When DNA evidence isn't available, innocence investigators may seek to establish alibis, interview witnesses overlooked by police, undermine mistaken witness identifications, or track down alternative suspects with a history of similar crimes. Attorneys have a much easier time getting a wrongful conviction reopened when they can point to the real culprit. \n \n Yet if a woman is wrongly convicted for an accident that kills her child, there is no crime to solve, no \"real killer,\" and probably no alibi. \n \n Overturning convictions for crimes that were really accidents is difficult and time-consuming. Attorneys may have to prove that the prosecution misused or misunderstood forensic science or withheld crucial evidence. Proving that something was an accident may require attorneys to understand highly technical and controversial evidence on fire science, shaken-baby syndrome, toxicology, or rare medical conditions, and hire expensive expert witnesses to bolster their arguments. These hurdles disproportionately affect women: Daniel and Royal have found that 37 percent of the women (but around 20 percent of the men) in the exonerations registry were cleared because their original convictions used false or misleading forensic evidence. \n \n There was one more thing that set exonerated women apart: Daniel and Royal have come to believe that, in many cases in which women were freed because no crime had been committed, sexist stereotypes had been used to conjure up a motive. \n \n \"Almost every case has something like this,\" Daniel told me, recounting one trial in which a prosecutor suggested a mother had killed her son so she could pursue a career in modeling. \"That was based on one tiny conversation expressing slight interest in maybe having a nice photo taken,\" Daniel said. The woman spent years in prison before the real perpetrator came forward. \n \n When Harper, the woman blamed after a serial killer murdered her son, was on trial, the prosecution portrayed her variously as thirsty for revenge on her ex-husband or, pointing out her pursuit of a postgraduate degree, career-obsessed with no time for a child. Her ex-husband testified that Harper considered an abortion when she first became pregnant (which Harper denied). \"And that was used to show she was capable of murder,\" Royal said, noting that the trial\u2014and jury selection\u2014took place in a rural, heavily conservative county in Illinois. \n \n In the case of Kristine Bunch, the prosecutor said he didn't think the blaze burned Bunch badly enough. Wouldn't a mother walk through fire to save her child? He offered evidence that Bunch was a bad mother, telling the jury in his closing argument that she had asked a friend to take custody of Tony, even though the friend had denied this rumor in her testimony. Not to mention the judge's comments about Bunch's pregnancy. \n \n These sorts of narratives have \"nothing to do with whether the evidence shows that a person did what they're being accused of,\" said Andrea Louise Lewis, an attorney who works for Royal and Daniel. \"And these women get wrongfully convicted in these cases where nothing happened. Nothing criminal happened at all.\" \n \n \n \n After Kristine Bunch gave birth to her second son, correctional officers put her in an ankle chain just long enough for her to reach the toilet in her hospital room. It had been three months since she went to prison. Bunch held her baby for a fleeting moment before her parents took him home with them. Then she made it her single-minded mission to find someone to help reopen her case. \n \n \"I realized, I'm going to have to fight,\" Bunch recalled. She sent out hundreds of letters and received hundreds of rejections. \n \n Daniel and Royal have come to believe that in many cases sexist stereotypes had been used to conjure up a motive. \n \n While Bunch despaired in prison, new research emerged showing that the signatures of an accidental fire are easy to confuse with signs of arson; as a result, many old arson cases have been called into question. In a similar vein, child abuse investigators once took it as gospel that a baby with brain swelling and certain forms of internal bleeding had been violently shaken within the past several hours. But a new body of evidence suggests that infections, infant strokes, and accidental falls can also cause the telltale symptoms of shaken-baby syndrome (SBS). Meanwhile, child abuse researchers now believe that a symptom like brain bleeding can take days\u2014not hours\u2014to cause serious problems. If a child has several caregivers\u2014a babysitter, relatives, and immediate family members\u2014it can be impossible to say with certainty who abused her. \n \n But it's prosecutors who decide whether to file charges or fight appeals, and not all of them buy the new science. When I sent questions about wrongly convicted women to the National District Attorneys Association, I was referred to Josh Marquis, an NDAA board member and Oregon district attorney who is a strident skeptic of the innocence community. Daniel and Royal noted that a disproportionate number of women are exonerated because new science cast doubt on their original conviction\u2014or even moved medical experts who once testified against them to change their minds. But Marquis said that he and many of his fellow prosecutors don't trust the developing science. New doubts about SBS, he said, are shared by only \"a very small group of doctors\" whose voices have been amplified by the defense bar. As for developments in arson science, he said, \"arson investigation is more of an art than a science.\" \n \n It was only when Bunch connected with an Indianapolis attorney named Hilary Bowe Ricks, and scraped together a modest fee using her $1.30-a-day prison earnings, that she learned that new arson science could cast her conviction into doubt. In 2006, Ricks convinced the Northwestern center to join the case, and the team, which by then included Daniel, soon found a bevy of problems with the conviction. Bunch's original defense attorney had argued that one of the trailer home's many electrical problems probably caused the fire. Any accelerant, he insisted, was likely from a kerosene heater the family sometimes ran in the living room. However, state investigators working on-site (using now-questionable science) observed burn patterns in Tony's bedroom that fire experts at the time saw as undisputed evidence of arson. And a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives chemist who examined 10 samples sent to his Washington, DC, lab testified at Bunch's original trial that the floor of both the living room and the bedroom tested positive for liquid accelerant. \n \n Bunch's new legal team obtained the raw data that the ATF chemist had analyzed. According to lawsuits her attorneys have since filed against the investigators for withholding evidence, someone had altered the result for the sample in Tony's bedroom, which was negative for accelerant, making Bunch seem guilty. It appeared to Ricks as though investigators hadn't found accelerant anywhere in the trailer home, except in the living room, where the heater stood. \n \n The fire that had taken Tony's life now looked like an accident. (The state investigators have denied any wrongdoing, and an ATF spokeswoman declined to comment.) \n \n Bunch's legal team brought this undisclosed evidence to the Indiana Court of Appeals. On March 21, 2012, a three-judge panel reversed Bunch's conviction. The state Supreme Court affirmed the ruling in August, and she walked out of prison, a free woman for the first time in more than 16 years. By Christmas, prosecutors quietly declined to retry her. \n \n \"When you walk out, you're exonerated, and you're free and clear. But that hurt, that humiliation, that shame\u2014it doesn't go away.\" \n \n \n \n A few months after Bunch was released, Daniel and Royal launched Northwestern's Women's Project, an exoneration effort focused exclusively on freeing wrongly convicted women. They have already agreed to represent six women\u2014cases that will involve child head trauma and arson science\u2014and in December, they asked the Illinois Supreme Court to grant their first appeal. Meanwhile, their team is poring over files from dozens of suspicious convictions around the country and amassing court transcripts for an in-depth study of wrongful convictions of women accused of killing their children. \n \n Daniel and Royal's tiny project may wind up in the vanguard of work to exonerate both men and women. More wrongful convictions are overturned each year, but fewer and fewer of them involve DNA: Paul Cates, a spokesman for the Innocence Project, told me that investigators have now cleared many \"easy\" DNA cases\u2014such as convictions that can be overturned by testing a single previously untested rape kit. Instead, more cases now involve complex DNA evidence, or none at all, and many more of those cases are ultimately found to involve an accident. Last year, a record 125 people were exonerated across the country; in 58 of those cases, courts found no crime was committed at all. \n \n Today, Kristine Bunch volunteers for the Women's Project, sorting through inmates' letters. She reads each one carefully, remembering the decade she spent writing pleas just like theirs. \"You live with this freaky numbness,\" she said. \"It's almost like you're underwater and everything is in slow motion. And you can't seem to pull yourself up out of it.\" \n \n She is thrilled that there is now an outfit giving convictions like hers its full attention, run by attorneys who understand that everything about a woman\u2014her career, her ambitions, how much she cries\u2014is ripe for judgment. In her off-hours, she is trying to get to know her 19-year-old son. Even though she saw him nearly every weekend in prison, she missed out on raising him, and building a strong relationship has proved difficult. \n \n So has the healing process. Many men who were wrongfully convicted didn't know their supposed victims. But with Bunch, the accident she was blamed for not only took 17 years of her life\u2014it took her child. \n \n \"You're accused of this horrible, horrible crime, you're put away, you have newspapers saying horrible, horrible things about you,\" she said. \"When you walk out, you're exonerated, and you're free and clear. But that hurt, that humiliation, that shame\u2014it doesn't go away because you've been exonerated. It's hard to step back out and act like you're normal and part of the world.\"",
    "summary": "\u2013 Exonerating women who are wrongfully convicted of violent crimes is no easy task\u2014just ask Kristine Bunch. She got 60 years for supposedly setting the fire that killed her 3-year-old son in 1995, and struggled to find anyone who could help, Mother Jones reports. Finally, lawyers at the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University's law school exposed a glaring hole (and possibly corruption) in the arson investigators' case. That evidence got Bunch released in 2012 after 16 years in prison, USA Today reported at the time. Then two lawyers from the Center, Karen Daniel and Judy Royal, began helping wrongfully convicted women based on a shocking statistic: Women constitute roughly 11% of violent-crime convictions but only 6% of overturned cases. But why are women's cases harder to overturn? Daniel and Royal give their reasons: Women are usually convicted of violent crimes against people close to them (like a husband or son) so DNA evidence won't help; the suspect's DNA is already spread around the crime scene. By contrast, men usually assault or kill strangers. An incredible 63% of women's exoneration cases turn out to be accidents or suicides rather than crimes. So instead of finding a \"real culprit,\" Daniel and Royal may have to laboriously dismantle the prosecutors' case, perhaps with new science on arson or shaken-baby syndrome that not everyone accepts. Sexist stereotypes are used against women in court. In the case of a woman wrongfully convicted of murdering her son, the prosecutor implied she did it to pursue a modeling career. \"That was based on one tiny conversation expressing slight interest in maybe having a nice photo taken,\" says Daniel. \"Almost every case has something like this.\" Click for Mother Jones' full article.",

(2:04) \n \n HOUSTON -- Astros first baseman Yuli Gurriel faces potential discipline from Major League Baseball for making a racially insensitive gesture Friday night during Game 3 of the World Series. \n \n After hitting a home run in the second inning off Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Yu Darvish, Gurriel returned to the Astros dugout, where he used his fingers to motion at his own eyes in a mocking gesture and appeared to mouth a derogatory term in Spanish. \n \n In a statement, an MLB spokesman said: \"We are aware of the situation and the Commissioner intends to speak with the player tomorrow.\" \n \n Speaking through an interpreter after the game, Gurriel said he made the gesture because he hasn't had success in the past against Japanese pitchers. In particular, he was 1-for-7 with one strikeout this season against Darvish. \n \n \"I did not mean it to be offensive at any point,\" Gurriel said. \"Quite the opposite. I have always had a lot of respect [for Japanese people]. ... I've never had anything against Darvish. For me, he's always been one of the best pitchers. I never had any luck against him. If I offended him, I apologize. It was not my intention.\" \n \n The 33-year-old Gurriel is a native of Cuba who played for the Yokohama DeNA Baystars of the Japanese Central League in 2014. Darvish is of Japanese and Iranian descent. \n \n Gurriel said it's common in Cuba to use the word \"chinito\" to describe someone of Asian heritage, although he admitted he realizes it's considered offensive in Japan. \n \n Darvish, also speaking through an interpreter, called the gesture and the word \"disrespectful.\" \n \n \"I feel like, of course, Houston has Asian fans and Japanese fans, and Asian fans live all over the place,\" Darvish said. \"And acting like that, it's just disrespectful to people around the world, to the Houston organization. It's not OK. \n \n \"Including him and I, nobody's perfect. Everybody's different. We've just got to learn from it. He made a mistake, and we've just got to learn from it. We are all human beings. It's just learn from it, and we've got to move forward.\" \n \n Astros manager A.J. Hinch described Gurriel as \"remorseful.\" Most Astros players said they weren't aware that Gurriel had made a gesture or that they hadn't seen it. \n \n Dodgers outfielder Enrique Hernandez described the situation as \"disappointing.\" \n \n \"It's just unfortunate that he did that right after the homer and not thinking the cameras were on him,\" Hernandez said. \"I'll let the league handle [potential discipline]. I'm not the right guy to handle that one.\" \n \n A source in the Dodgers organization said the team is \"very upset\" about the situation, \"especially in these times in this environment.\" \n \n Darvish later tweeted a statement, saying people should put effort into \"learning rather than to accuse [Gurriel].\" \n \n \"If we can take something from this, that is a giant step for mankind,\" Darvish wrote. \"Since we are living in such a wonderful world, let's stay positive and move forward instead of focusing on anger. I'm counting on everyone's big love.\" \n \n Darvish played professionally in Japan from 2005 to 2011 before joining the Texas Rangers in 2012. He was traded to the Dodgers at this year's July 31 trade deadline. \n \n The Astros lead the series 2-1, with Game 4 set for Saturday at Minute Maid Park. \n \n ESPN's Marly Rivera and Ramona Shelburne contributed to this report. ||||| CLOSE Yu Darvish was hit early and often and the Houston Astros beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 3 of the World Series. USA TODAY Sports \n \n Yuli Gurriel rounds the bases after hitting a solo home run in the second inning. (Photo: Thomas Shea, USA TODAY Sports) \n \n HOUSTON \u2013 The World Series was roiled by a race-related incident in Friday night\u2019s Game 3 when Houston Astros first baseman Yuli Gurriel made a racist gesture in the wake of hitting a home run off Los Angeles Dodgers starter Yu Darvish. \n \n TV cameras caught Gurriel, a Cuban, making a slant-eyed gesture and laughing after his home run off Darvish kick-started a four-run second inning. \n \n Gurriel apologized afterward, saying he did not mean to offend Darvish, a native of Japan. \n \n MORE FROM GAME 3 \n \n \u201cYesterday I was commenting that I\u2019d never had any success against Darvish, and the gesture was saying that I wish he would look at me like one of them and maybe he\u2019d throw me an easy pitch so I can do something,\u2019\u2019 said Gurriel, who was 1-for-7 in his career against Darvish before the home run. \u201cAt no point did I mean that in an offensive way. On the contrary, I\u2019ve always had a lot of respect for them.\u2019\u2019 \n \n Gurriel, who had a successful stint in the Japanese league in 2014 before defecting from Cuba and signing with the Astros in July 2016, also acknowledged using the word \u201cchinito\u2019\u2019 \u2013 little Chinese guy \u2013 in the dugout in reference to Darvish. \n \n \u201cIn Cuba and in other places, we call all Asian people Chinese,\u2019\u2019 Gurriel said. \u201cBut I played in Japan and I know they find that offensive, so I apologize for that. I know they don\u2019t like it.\u2019\u2019 \n \n Darvish, the Japanese right-hander in his sixth major league season, said after the game that he'd seen a replay of the sequence and said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d in Gurriel\u2019s gesture. \n \n \"Acting like that\u2026is disrespectful to people around the world,\" Darvish said through his interpreter after the Astros' 5-3 victory in Game 3. \"I try not to care much about it, but he played in Japan and I have a lot of respect for him, so I try not to think about it too much against him.\" \n \n Darvish seemed subdued, but forgiving of Gurriel's gesture. \n \n \"Nobody\u2019s perfect. And everybody\u2019s different,\" he says. \" And we\u2019re going to have to learn from it. We are all human beings. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. We\u2019ll learn from it and we have to go forward.\" \n \n Dodgers teammate Kike Hernandez said he talked to Darvish about the incident and said Darvish was \"extremely disappointed, as expected.\" Earlier this season, Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Kevin Pillar was suspended three games for directing a homophobic slur toward an opponent. It's not likely such a punishment would be adjudicated between Major League Baseball and the union during the World Series, but MLB has shown a greater intolerance for hateful speech. \n \n \"I'll let the league handle that one,\" said Hernandez, a native of Puerto Rico. \"All I can say it\u2019s disappointing to me. It\u2019s just unfortunate that he did that right after that and not thinking that the cameras were on him. \n \n \"I\u2019m sure (Darvish) is (stung). If it was meant toward Puerto Ricans, I\u2019d be really disappointed. If he is really mad inside and didn't say much, I\u2019m really proud of him for handling it the right way and remaining professional.\" \n \n MLB commissioner Rob Manfred is expected to meet with Gurriel before Saturday's game. \n \n Gallery: Best of the 2017 World Series",

While some voters will feel a bit of a sugar-high from the conventions, the basic structure of the race has not changed significantly. The reality of the Obama economy will reassert itself as the ultimate downfall of the Obama Presidency, and Mitt Romney will win this race. \n \n In his acceptance speech, President Obama did not offer any solutions for the millions of Americans unemployed or underemployed. But his convention speech was not the only big letdown to voters, as Americans also dealt with yet another dismal jobs report last week. President Obama is the only president in modern American history to stand before the American people asking for re-election with this many Americans struggling to find work. The key numbers in this election are the 43 straight months of 8% or higher unemployment, the 23 million Americans struggling to find work, and the 47 million Americans who are on food stamps. \n \n Today, there is no question: Americans are not better off than we were four years ago, and that is why President Obama has struggled in this race. The truth is that some of President Obama\u2019s allies are claiming victory, but others are acknowledging the unsustainable position in which they find themselves. This is evidenced in a recent quote in The New York Times by an Obama Administration official saying, \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not what I would call the position we wanted to be in at this point in the race\u2026He\u2019s going to have to make the case that we wouldn\u2019t even be at 8 percent if it weren\u2019t for him.\u201d \n \n Consider the following points: \n \n The Obama Economy: The stakes are very high in this election, and voters understand the future of our country is on the line. This may be lost on those living within the hyper-political world in and around the Beltway, but it is not lost in communities in battleground states. In short, the Romney-Ryan campaign understands Americans struggling in the Obama economy will determine the outcome of the race, and once the preponderance of information about the President\u2019s failed policies \u2013 combined with Mitt Romney\u2019s vision to strengthen the middle class \u2013 are communicated, our nation will move in a different direction. \n \n All Signs Point to a Tight Race: Those watching the daily tracking polls know that, while the President has seen a bounce from his convention, his approval has already begun to slip, indicating it is likely to recede further. In eight states, Pollster.com\u2019s reporting of the most recent statewide polls puts the margin between the two candidates at less than three points, virtually guaranteeing a tight race. Next, the battlefield has actually expanded, not contracted. Note that Wisconsin is now in play and our campaign is now up with ads in that state, while the latest poll numbers from the Albuquerque Journal in New Mexico show the race closing there. And this tightening is not an anomaly. Consider the traditional Democratic strongholds of New Jersey and Connecticut, won by President Obama in 2008 by margins of 15 points and 22 points, respectively. In both states, Pollster.com\u2019s reporting of the most recent statewide polls puts Obama\u2019s lead at only seven points in each of these states. In North Carolina, fresh off of hosting the Democratic National Convention, the Obama campaign is laying the groundwork for a stealth withdrawal. In a state the President won by a mere 14,000 votes in 2008, all one has to do is look at the Obama campaign\u2019s television buy in the state to understand how they view their chances there. The Obama campaign\u2019s North Carolina television buy has dropped 35% compared to June, and they have run more than twice as much advertising over the past two weeks in Rochester, Minnesota (hitting a small slice of Iowa), than they have in any North Carolina market. \n \n Historical Data: Political campaign historians will recall President Jimmy Carter led Ronald Reagan by a near double digit margin late in the fall in 1980. In that race, the voters made their decision based on the key issues confronting the nation and it determined the outcome. On the economy, the most important issue of this race, Mitt Romney leads by 51%-45%, according to the most recent CNN/ORC poll. \n \n Targeted Campaign: The Romney-Ryan campaign is running deeply local and targeted efforts in each of the states focusing on the voter groups that will make the difference on Election Day. Anyone asserting a \u201cone-size-fits-all-campaign\u201d effort is being put forward is simply misinformed, as evidenced by the 15 different ads released by the Romney Ryan campaign this past Friday and now running in nine states, including Wisconsin. \n \n New Money Advantage: All of this is not possible without resources, and the Romney-Ryan campaign and the Republican Party have a real advantage. In August alone, the Romney Victory effort raised more than $111 million, marking the third straight fundraising month of more than $100 million, putting us on a very strong financial footing for the final two months. \n \n Energy and Enthusiasm: CNN/ORC\u2019s most recent polling shows that 62% of Republicans are \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d excited about this election, while only 56% of Democrats report being \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d excited. This Republican enthusiasm advantage has manifested itself in an unprecedented and historic grassroots effort that will have a significant impact on turnout in battleground states on Election Day. For instance, as of today, Victory volunteers have already knocked on more doors than during the entire 2008 campaign. (2.72 million in 2012 through September 8 compared to 2.43 million overall in 2008.) \n \n Romney\u2019s Ground Game: During last weekend\u2019s \u201cSuper Saturday,\u201d we crossed the 20 million volunteer voter contact threshold. Also, the Romney campaign knocked on more doors last week than in any week during the 2008 campaign. More than 55,000 volunteers have knocked doors or made phone calls for Victory this year and that number is growing by the week. And volunteers have collected person-to-person identification information on nearly 1.7 million swing voters in battleground states thus far. And the numbers are even more startling when one looks at individual states. For instance, in Ohio alone, five times more phone calls and 28 times more door knocks have been made than at this time in 2008. This past Saturday, more than 100,000 doors were knocked on by Victory volunteers in the Buckeye State. And in Wisconsin, five times more phone calls and 72 times more door knocks have been made than at this time in 2008. And the list goes on and on. \n \n Mitt Romney will be the next President. The outcome of this race will ultimately be determined in favor of Governor Romney because he has the better leadership skills, the better record, and the better vision for where he wants to take the country. These advantages are being fueled by the commitment and determination of volunteers and voters to change direction and move our country on a path toward economic growth and job creation. In short, the combination of having the superior candidate, being in a margin-of-error race with an incumbent President, having a cash advantage, and having an unprecedented grassroots effort and a winning message on the economy ensure that Americans will make a change in leadership in Washington on November 6. ||||| AP \n \n The Mitt Romney campaign circulated a statement Monday from its pollster, Neil Newhouse, conceding that President Barack Obama \"has seen a bounce from his convention\" in daily tracking polls but urging readers not to \"get too worked up about the latest polling.\" \n \n Newhouse characterized the recent shift to Obama as \"a bit of a sugar-high from the conventions\" and argued that the \"basic structure of the race has not changed significantly\": \n \n All Signs Point to a Tight Race: Those watching the daily tracking polls know that, while the President has seen a bounce from his convention, his approval has already begun to slip, indicating it is likely to recede further.

Sometimes I think there's a conscious effort between the media and Chicago to get Republicans depressed. \n \n A poll tracking model created for HuffPost Pollster by political scientist Simon Jackman, based on all polling at the national and state levels, shows that the conventions have helped boost Obama's share of the vote to his highest levels since early March. The model currently has Obama leading Romney by 3 percentage points. ||||| I asked a top Romney adviser what he makes of reports that the Romney campaign knows it\u2019s losing and that Ohio is slipping out of reach (PPP has a new poll with Obama at 50 in the state): \n \n It\u2019s horses**t.

And the more Washington DC controls our economy, the more important inside-the-beltway publications are and the more money they make. The 202 area code is dominated by people who will make more money if Obama is reelected, so it\u2019s not just an ideological thumb they\u2019re putting on the scale for him, it\u2019s a business interest. \n \n I actually think the other side is in a panic. You look at New Mexico closing up. And they\u2019re not above 50 in any of their target states. Look, we\u2019re raising money, they\u2019re raising money, and it\u2019s tight. This is a dogfight.

    "document": "The rate of developing esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) nearly doubles in those who both smoke and drink compared to those who only smoke or drink, according to new research published in The American Journal of Gastroenterology. Although multiple studies have identified risk factors for the development of ESCC, notably, exposure to alcohol and tobacco, this research is the first meta-analysis to look at the interaction between alcohol and tobacco in the risk of ESCC, a class of esophageal cancer that begins in the flat cells lining the esophagus. \n \n \"Our study suggests that not only do alcohol and tobacco play an important role in the development of esophageal cancer, the combination of their use markedly increases their potency as carcinogens. As a result, we as physicians should focus efforts directed at controlling the burden of esophageal cancer on those who consume both of these substances,\" said lead author Anoop Prabhu, MD, Advanced Endoscopy Fellow at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, in New York, NY. \n \n Dr. Prabhu, and authors Drs. Kenneth O. Obi and Joel H. Rubenstein at the University of Michigan Medical School, performed a systematic literature search in multiple electronic databases and looked at population-based case-control or cohort studies of ESCC that assessed the effects of tobaccos and/or alcohol. A synergy factor was calculated from each study to estimate the interaction on a multiplicative scale between tobacco and alcohol on the outcome of ESCC. \n \n \"Our systematic review confirmed the expected exposure-dependent relationship of both alcohol and tobacco with the risk of ESCC, as alcohol use and tobacco use were both independent risk factors for the development of ESCC,\" stated Dr. Prabhu. \n \n According to the National Cancer Institute, it is estimated in 2014 there will be over 18,000 new cases of esophageal cancer in the United States, and over 15,000 deaths from the disease. ||||| \"Grape or grain, but never the twain.\" So runs the old folk wisdom that advises against drinking wine or beer on the same night. It is far from uncommon to hear people who have woken up feeling sick, dehydrated and with a splitting headache blaming their hangovers on having unwisely mixed their drinks. \n \n Then there are the theories about the order in which to consume different tipples. One version suggests: \u201cWine before beer and you\u2019ll feel queer. Beer before wine and you\u2019ll feel fine.\u201d Or is it the other way round? After a couple of drinks it\u2019s not always easy to remember. All of which begs the question of how reliable these sayings are. Is there any evidence beyond the anecdotal that drinking wine followed by beer or vice versa makes hangovers worse? \n \n A review of previous research published in 2000 confirms that the causes of the main symptoms of hangovers are dehydration, changes in the levels of hormones such as aldosterone and cortisol, and the toxic effects of alcohol itself. In addition there\u2019s evidence that the immune system is disrupted and that this could be the cause of the headache, the nausea and the fatigue. \n \n \n \n The first of the two main ingredients of a drink that affect the severity of a hangover is obvious. The higher the alcohol content, and the faster you drink it, the worse the hangover. This is however just an average. The same quantity of alcohol does not always result in the same severity of hangover. Many report that they don\u2019t get hangovers and no one quite knows why. In a study of young Danes on holiday, almost a third of those who consumed at least 12 units of alcohol (roughly equivalent to four pints of lager or four 250ml glasses of wine) avoided hangovers. \n \n Mixing drinks needn\u2019t necessarily increase the overall amount of alcohol consumed, but it may do with cocktails. If combining three or four measures of spirits alongside other ingredients, a throbbing head and dry throat is probably just the result of consuming more alcohol in total. \n \n Beyond the ethanol that triggers intoxication, the other key ingredients that affect hangovers are what the beverage industry calls congeners. These are the other substances produced during fermentation, such as acetone, acetaldehyde, fusel oil and the best-known, tannins, which give darker drinks their colour and part of their flavour. Bourbon whisky, for example, contains 37 times the quantity of congeners as vodka. \n \n To find out the effect of these substances on hangover severity, researchers in the US recruited university students who were regular drinkers, without alcohol problems. On different nights they were given either bourbon and cola, vodka and cola or a placebo which consisted of cola mixed with tonic, with a few drops of either bourbon or vodka to make it taste similar to the real stuff. They drank anything between three and six drinks, however much was enough to give them a concentration of 0.11g of alcohol per 100ml of breath. This would put them two to five times over the drink drive limit, depending which country they were in. They then spent the night in the clinic and were woken at 7am for breakfast before taking part in a battery of tests. For this they were paid a rather generous $450. The researchers found the students who drank bourbon rated their hangovers as worse, but interestingly they performed just as well on tasks such as reaction time tests. \n \n Clear drinks such as white rum, vodka and gin tend to cause fewer and less severe hangovers because they contain relatively low levels of congeners. Perhaps those who mix their drinks are more likely to choose a dark-coloured drink containing higher levels of these substances simply by virtue of their wider drinking range, but again it isn't the mixing in itself that causes the problem. \n \n No scientist seems to have done the perfect counter-balanced study where people are randomly assigned to drink beer followed by wine or wine followed by beer. But perhaps it\u2019s not the grape or the grain that matters, but the effect that the strength of those drinks has on judgement. Beer is only between a third and half the strength of wine, so starting on it leads to less intoxication if followed by the stronger stuff. But if a person starts on wine or spirits, then their judgement may be impaired enough to drink more heavily later. There\u2019s certainly evidence that people are not good at judging their own drunkenness. At low levels people overestimate the amount of alcohol in our blood, but after a few drinks they start to underestimate it. \n \n So, the existing evidence suggests that hangovers can't be blamed on mixing drinks. It's probably down to the high congener count of the booze, or over-drinking. As for hangover cures, scientists have looked into those too, and the British Medical Journal published a review of trials of everything from borage to artichoke and glucose to prickly pears in 2005. The bad news for drinkers is that none of them work. \n \n Do you agree? If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our Facebook or Google+ page, or message us on Twitter.",
    "summary": "\u2013 Many of us may avoid downing hard alcohol, wine, and beer on the same night for fear of a raging hangover the next day. But at the BBC, a review of existing research on the topic suggests the drinks' variety itself isn't the problem. Instead, Claudia Hammond points to other possible factors. For instance, she notes, having several different types of drinks may simply mean drinking more total alcohol. (As for \"beer before liquor, never been sicker\"? It appears no research has been done to prove or disprove the idea that drink order makes a difference.) \"The existing evidence suggests that hangovers can't be blamed on mixing drinks,\" Hammond writes. But the amount of alcohol may not be the only culprit: Congeners, the non-ethanol products of the fermentation process, also contribute to a hangover. Tannins, for instance, are responsible for the color in darker types of alcohol. There are 37 times more congeners in bourbon than in vodka, and one study found that bourbon drinkers reported worse hangovers than those who drank vodka. So, Hammond writes, people having various types of drinks in a single night may end up indulging in drinks with more tannins. So go ahead and mix types of alcohol if you so desire, but you may want to avoid mixing alcohol with cigarettes: A study last month found that people who smoke and drink are at a higher risk of developing esophageal cancer, Science Daily reported. (If you do find yourself with a hangover, you may want to reach for a Sprite.)",

    "document": "BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) \u2014 Scientists from the U.S. and Denmark are seeking to map out the plumbing system hidden inside the earth's crust that's responsible for the famous Old Faithful geyser and other hydrothermal features at Yellowstone National Park. \n \n Throughout November the research team will conduct flights over the park using a giant, hoop-shaped electromagnetic system suspended from a helicopter. The device acts like an X-ray to determine where and how hot water flows beneath the surface. \n \n The team also hopes to gain insights into the infrequent but sometimes massive hydrothermal explosions that occur in the park, said lead scientist Carol Finn with the U.S. Geological Survey. \n \n One such explosion, or possibly multiple explosions, that occurred roughly 13,800 years ago left a crater that measures 1-1/2 miles (2.6 km) across beneath at the bottom of Yellowstone Lake. It's believed to be the largest such crater in the world. \n \n Similar to the regular eruptions of Old Faithful, hydrothermal explosions occur when huge pockets of boiling water beneath the ground experience a sudden drop in pressure, causing the water to convert to steam and explode violently to the surface. \n \n Similar work elsewhere in the U.S. has helped reveal hazards from volcanoes. \n \n \"Nobody knows anything about the flow paths\" for the hot water that erupts from Yellowstone's geysers, Finn said. \"Does it travel down and back up? Does it travel laterally?\" \n \n The electromagnetic system was developed in Denmark to map out groundwater supplies in Denmark. It's able to discern between water and rocks to a depth of about 1,500 feet beneath the surface. \n \n In Yellowstone, a better understanding of the hydrothermal plumbing could help administrators plot out future development so tourists can enjoy the park's features without damaging them or being put into harm's way. \n \n The study is a collaboration between the U.S.G.S., Yellowstone National Park, the University of Wyoming and Denmark's Aarhus University. ||||| This week, a survey will begin to map the underground hydrothermal features of Yellowstone National Park for the first time. \n \n The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in collaboration with the Aarhus University in Denmark and the University of Wyoming, will use a helicopter carrying electromagnetic technology that resembles a giant hula hoop to record tiny voltage signals. \n \n The data will be able to tell the scientists if they are flying over solid earth, \u201crotten\u201d sulfuric rock, or water. Carol Finn, one of the scientists on the surveying team, said she has been looking forward to this for ten years. \n \n \u201cThis is really kind of a last frontier if you will, in Yellowstone, of being able to look at a large part that\u2019s underground that people that people have not looked at,\u201d said Finn. \u201cThis survey can visualize the geology and the water down to about 500 meters, so 1500 feet.\u201d \n \n The goal of the project is to fill in the gaps of knowledge about what causes geysers like Old Faithful and hydrothermal explosions by locating where all that heated water flows underground. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s just a lot we don\u2019t know and this survey is really exciting because it\u2019s going to be the first view of a large portion of the groundwater system, of the water underground that feeds all of these thermal features,\u201d said Finn. \n \n The survey will also provide information that could help the park in the future by locating unstable ground. The researchers will fly the helicopter along the Mammoth-Norris corridor and take at least four weeks to complete.",
    "summary": "\u2013 The mysteries of Old Faithful may soon be solved, thanks, in part, to something that looks like a giant hula hoop. American and Danish scientists have this week begun an aerial survey of Yellowstone that actually looks well into the earth, \"visualizing\" the geology and water as much as 1,500 feet below the surface, says Carol Finn. She's waited a decade to explore what she calls \"a last frontier ... in Yellowstone,\" and the intention is to better map the flow of water that's feeding Old Faithful and rare but sometimes violent hydrothermal explosions. Over a four-week period, a helicopter will fly above, armed with electromagnetic technology that looks like a giant hula hoop. The AP explains it in layman's terms: \"The device acts like an X-ray to determine where and how hot water flows beneath the surface.\" Scientists will use the data to determine whether solid earth, \"rotten\" sulfuric rock, or water lurks below, which could assist in identifying unstable areas, per Wyoming Public Media. But a press release frames the main quest like so: We know that the water that explodes from Yellowstone's geysers \"originates as old precipitation, snow and rain that percolates down into the crust, is heated, and ultimately returns to the surface.\" We know that it can take as long as thousands of years for that process to run its course. What scientists are hoping to determine are the routes these waters take. \"Does it travel down and back up? Does it travel laterally?\" asks Finn. Right now, \"nobody knows.\" (Archaeologists made a surprise find underneath a Mayan temple.)",

    "document": "Once they sense danger, fruit flies can pitch their bodies like a fighter jet during flight, rolling almost upside down in order to shift momentum and speed to avoid a oncoming threat, new research shows. \n \n \u201cWe discovered that fruit flies alter course in less than one one-hundredth of a second, 50 times faster than we blink our eyes, which is faster than we ever imagined.\u201d Michael Dickinson, UW professor of biology and co-author of the paper about these findings, said in a news release. \n \n In his lab, Dickinson and other researchers have found that evasive maneuvers performed by fruit flies, also known as Drosophila hydei, are very similar to those of a fighter jet. His research will be published in the April 11 issue of Science. \n \n Escape Maneuver in a Flying Fly from Michael Dickinson on Vimeo. \n \n More like a plane than a boat \n \n \u201cOne of the fastest things a fruit fly does is take information from its eyes and react accordingly,\u201d Dickinson said. \n \n Previous research suggested that flies would turn like a boat would, Dickinson said, but this new research has shown that they can pitch their body and perform banked turns much like a plane would. \n \n \u201cThey do this with remarkably subtle changes in wing movement,\u201d Dickinson told us. \n \n Florian Muijres, lead author of the paper and postdoctoral researcher, said that it\u2019s both the speed and accuracy of the flies that they have found impressive. \n \n \u201cWhat we have found is that these flies are fast and accurate in their response,\u201d Muijres said. \n \n According to Muijres, the flies can roll almost completely upside down while flying thanks to the incredible speed at which they flap their wings. \n \n \u201cThese flies normally flap their wings 200 times a second and, in almost a single wing beat, the animal can reorient its body to generate a force away from the threatening stimulus and then continues to accelerate,\u201d Muijres said in the UW release. \n \n The fly\u2019s brain may be small, but it\u2019s very dense with neurons. Muijres said a fly\u2019s brain is actually more dense than a human brain. The mystery of how these little creatures are able to perform such amazing feats is still pushing the researchers at UW forward with their research. \n \n \u201cWe have the input and the output and now we are looking at how the input translates into the output,\u201d Muijres said. \n \n Using tech to slow down time \n \n UW researchers used three high speed cameras to accurately capture the flies\u2019 movements in a 20-by-20 centimeter flight arena. They used an expanding shadow effect to make the fly take evasive action, and the cameras recorded the action at 7,500 frames per second. \n \n Escape Maneuver Fly SetupNrobofly from Michael Dickinson on Vimeo. \n \n Because the camera shutters were opening and closing every one thirty-thousandth of a second, they need to light the flight arena so the cameras would be able to get the footage. Dickinson said they used infra-red light in order to light the space for the cameras without blinding the flies in the process. \n \n \u201cWhen the flies would go through the focus of all three cameras is when we would start recording,\u201d Dickinson said. \n \n Once the measurements and video were recorded, the scientists were able to replicate the fly\u2019s movement on a robot fly model. \n \n \u201cWe are able to take the measurements and replay them on the robot and directly measure the forces the wings were generating,\u201d Dickinson said. \n \n Amazing brains \n \n Dickinson said a fruit fly\u2019s brain performs very complicated calculations in a split second, an amazing level of calculation for something so small. \n \n \u201cHow can such a small brain generate so many remarkable behaviors? A fly with a brain the size of a salt grain has the behavioral repertoire nearly as complex as a much larger animal such as a mouse. That\u2019s a super interesting problem from an engineering perspective,\u201d Dickinson said in a news release. \n \n Check out some more videos of the fruit fly in action: \n \n Escape Maneuver FlyModel from Michael Dickinson on Vimeo. \n \n Escape Maneuver Fly Topview from Michael Dickinson on Vimeo. \n \n Escape Maneuver in Fly #2 from Michael Dickinson on Vimeo. \n \n Break out your 3D glasses for this one: \n \n Escape Maneuver FlyModel 3D from Michael Dickinson on Vimeo. ||||| Fruit flies could make some talented fighter pilots. Scientists who had the insects wing it through two laser beams watched the bugs make hairpin turns at blazing fast speeds, by banking in the same way that fighter jet planes do. The findings, published in the journal Science, shed light on these tiny critters\u2019 remarkable ability to evade predators (and fly swatters). \n \n [Updated at 5:15 p.m. PDT April 10: Tracking how these insects fly in response to a threat should help researchers understand the fruit fly's inner life, said Cornell University physicist Jane Wang, who was not involved in the research. \n \n \"The insects turn because they have some internal control circuitry, just like a pilot [who's] turning a plane,\" Wang said. \"And by looking how the insects turn, we might be able to say what the 'pilot' is thinking.\"] \n \n When trying to escape from a threat, the Drosophila hydei flies turn at a speed that\u2019s five times faster than their normal turning speed, according to researchers from the University of Washington. Instead of turning right or left on the \"yaw\" axis, like a boat in the water, the flies execute banked turns, by rolling and pitching their bodies at the same time, which supercharges their turns. They can execute one of these within less than one hundredth of a second after seeing a threat, the scientists said. That\u2019s 50 times faster than the blink of an eye. \n \n \u201cA lot of other people working in the field \u2026 would not have predicted the fly could rotate itself so quickly,\u201d said study coauthor Michael Dickinson, a neurobiologist at the University of Washington in Seattle. \n \n Dickinson and his colleagues captured 3,566 wing beats involved in 92 separate fruit fly escapes, which was no easy task. To capture such infinitesimally tiny movements, the scientists had to use high-speed cameras that took 7,500 frames per second -- that\u2019s nearly 40 frames for each wing beat. They also needed flood the flight area with light to capture the motions in high detail -- but all that light would blind the flies, which wouldn\u2019t be able to maneuver. \n \n Instead, they had to use infrared light, whose wavelength is too long for human or fly eyes to pick up on. All the circuitry in those lights generated so much heat that the scientists had to run an air conditioner in the laboratory, forcing the researchers to dress warmly in already chilly Seattle weather. \n \n There were, Dickinson said, \u201ca whole lot of wool hats worn in the lab.\u201d \n \n The scientists watched the flies fly through two crossing laser beams, causing their own shadow to loom large like an impending threat. In response, the flies quickly executed their escape maneuvers, which the scientists were able to capture on camera. \n \n The videos showed that the flies could roll to one side by 90 degrees or even more as they made these turns, almost bringing them upside down. And they could make these turns in less than two wing beats -- which is pretty remarkable, given that they typically flap their wings at 200 times per second, the scientists said. \n \n \u201cSo it\u2019d kind of be like a jet fighter pilot with a stick in his or her hand, only had to make a little bit of tiny change in the stick and pshooo, the plane goes off,\u201d Dickinson said. \u201cSo we\u2019re very interested in how the brain can control motion on such a fine scale.\u201d \n \n With all this high quality data, the scientists were able to pull out mathematical rules that governed the flies\u2019 decisions on how to make a banked turn, and they then programmed them into a robotic fly that they tested in flowing mineral oil. (Because the robot was much bigger than the flies, the scientists had to adjust the viscosity of the fluid they were \"flying\" through so the physics would stay about the same, the scientists said.) \n \n The next step, Dickinson said, is to understand the complex neural circuitry linked to the flight muscles that makes these daring maneuvers possible. \n \n ALSO: \n \n Hallelujah!

Crying generally peaks at around two hours fifteen minutes per day at six weeks \u2013 and reduces gradually to an average of 1 hour 10 minutes by the twelve week mark. \n \n However, some infants were found to cry as little as 30 minutes - and others over 5 hours - in twenty-four hours. \n \n Babies cry the most in the UK, Italy, Canada, and the Netherlands \u2013 and the lowest levels of crying were found in Denmark, Germany and Japan. \n \n The highest levels of colic \u2013 defined as crying more than 3 hours a day for at least 3 days a week in a baby\u2013 were found in the UK (28% of infants at 1-2 weeks), Canada (34.1% at 3-4 weeks of age) and Italy (20.9% at 8-9 weeks of age). \n \n In contrast, lowest colic rates were reported in Denmark (5.5% at 3-4 weeks) and Germany (6.7% at 3-4 weeks). \n \n The current definitions for determining whether a baby is crying too much and suffering from colic, are the Wessel criteria, which were formulated in the 1950s. \n \n As childcare and the family unit has largely transformed over the last half century and across different cultures, new universal guidelines were needed for modern parents and health professionals to assess normal and excessive levels of crying in babies. \n \n Professor Wolke comments on what the research will lead to: \n \n \u201cBabies are already very different in how much they cry in the first weeks of life \u2013 there are large but normal variations. We may learn more from looking at cultures where there is less crying and whether this may be due to parenting or other factors relating to pregnancy experiences or genetics. \n \n \u201cThe new chart of normal fuss/cry amounts in babies across industrialised countries will help health professionals to reassure parents whether a baby is crying within the normal expected range in the first 3 months or shows excessive crying which may require further evaluation and extra support for the parents.\u201d \n \n The research, \u2018Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis: Fussing and Crying Durations and Colic Prevalence in Infants\u2019 is published in The Journal of Pediatrics. \n \n 3 April 2017 ||||| Professor Dieter Wolke, who led the research, said: \u201cGerman and Danish parents are much less likely to get worked up and they will wait a little bit before they intervene to see if the baby can self-sooth. \n \n \u201cThey don\u2019t get all worried about it.\u201d \n \n Across all the countries examined for the survey, babies cried for an average of two hours per day in the first two weeks after birth. \n \n Crying peaked at about two hours and 15 minutes each day at six weeks of age, before gradually reducing to an average of one hour and 10 minutes. \n \n Previous research has indicated that around 40 per cent of infant crying is inconsolable, and Professor Wolke said many new mothers and fathers are unduly stressed by some \u201cunscientific\u201d parenting books which offer bogus solutions. \n \n Concern in Britain over crying babies costed the NHS an estimated \u00a370 million each year, he said, with stressed-out parents less more likely to reinforce a pattern of crying. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s the same principal as going on a plane,\u201d he said. \n \n \u201cYou are told to put your own oxygen mask on before helping others. \n \n \u201cIf you are not relaxed you are not going to be any use to your baby.\u201d \n \n But he added that adult well-being surveys consistently put Denmark as one of the happiest countries in the world and that Danish babies may enjoy some \u201cgenetic bias\u201d whereby they cry less. \n \n \u201cThe new chart of normal fuss/cry amounts in babies across industrialised countries will help health care professions to reassure parents whether a baby is crying within the normal expected range in the first three months or shows excessive crying which may require further evaluation and extra support for the parents,\u201d he said.",
    "summary": "\u2013 New research into the amount of time that infants in various countries spend crying found that the littlest ones in usually placid Canada were the most colicky. British babies came in second, followed by Italy. The most tranquil tots, meanwhile, live in Denmark and Germany. Writing in the Journal of Pediatrics, psychologists at the University of Warwick analyzed 28 previous studies of some 8,700 infants to measure colic\u2014a harmless, if nerve-jangling, condition\u2014by gauging crying times during the first 12 weeks. The longest crying jags were clocked in Canada, reports the Guardian, where 34.1% of babies wailed more than three hours a day, at least three days a week. In the UK, the tally was 28% and in Italy 20.9%. Relatively blissful Danish babes scored 5.5%, with Germany at 6.7%. The first-of-its kind analysis found that babies the world over cry around two hours a day for the first weeks, peaking at two hours and 15 minutes at six weeks. Happily for stressed-out new parents everywhere, crying time is halved by week 12, per a press release. Lead researcher Dieter Wolke says parents in countries with low colic scores are less likely to intervene when baby starts crying, allowing the infant to self-soothe. \"They don\u2019t get all worried about it,\" Wolke tells the Telegraph. Then again, he notes, Danish babies may enjoy a bit of \"genetic bias\" since their country consistently ranks at the top of wellness surveys. In any case, new parents should learn to chill. \"If you are not relaxed you are not going to be any use to your baby,\" Wolke says. (Crying saved this baby's life.)",

The trauma surgeon who first treated Mackenzie in the ER didn't expect her to survive. \"I'm glad to be wrong about that,\" Dr. Jeffrey Bender of the University of Oklahoma Medical Center in Oklahoma City said Tuesday at a news conference. \n \n Currently, Wethington is awake and breathing on her own and is listed in fair condition. \u201cWe see worse injuries routinely from car and ATV accidents,\u201d said trauma surgeon Dr. Jason Lees, who is part of the Oklahoma team treating Wethington. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason we wear parachutes when we step out of a plane.\u201d \n \n Amazingly, Wethington, who suffered a lacerated liver and kidney, broken teeth and multiple fractures throughout her body, is expected to fully recover within about six to eight weeks, Bender said Tuesday. Her injuries are \"consistent with someone hit by a car going 40-50 mph,\" although that doesn't mean she hit the ground at that speed, he said. \n \n According to the World Health Organization, falls are the second leading cause of accidental or unintentional injury deaths worldwide. Each year an estimated 424,000 individuals die from falls globally. And it doesn\u2019t have to be a 3,500-foot mishap. \n \n \n \n \u201cA person can take a fall from a standing height and the neck can break, so this young girl is exceptionally fortunate in how the circumstances and force of the fall dissipated throughout her body,\u201d said Dr. Ryan Goodwin, director of the Center for Pediatric and Adolescent Orthopedics at the Cleveland Clinic. \u201cShe is young, and in seeming good health, so she has that going for her.\u201d But, he adds, she also had a lot of luck and physics on her side, too. \n \n \n \n When an individual falls from a great height, survival often depends on a lot of luck, as well as air resistance, or drag. \n \n \u201cYou can think of a fall as a form of energy,\u201d explained James Kakalios, the Taylor Distinguished Professor in the school of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Minnesota. \u201cBasically, if a person steps out of a plane you have no velocity. Gravity will start to pull you down and you accelerate.\u201d \n \n \n \n But as you gain speed, air resistance comes into play and acts as a kind of brake slowing you down and reducing the amount of kinetic energy, or in other words, the force in which your body slams into the ground, said Kakalios, author of the Physics of Superheroes. \n \n He thinks the teen may have done some things accidentally to increase air drag, slowing her fall, and leading to a potentially softer, yet still serious, landing. \n \n \u201cShe\u2019s creating a lot of turbulence as she falling, and therefore she\u2019s maximizing the time it takes for her to hit the ground,\u201d he said, citing that reducing the rate in which an object, or person, comes to a stop is critical for safety. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have airbags,\u201d Kakalios said, citing other instances of people surviving long falls such as I- 35W bridge collapse in Minneapolis in which 13 people were killed, but 145 survived the 115-foot fall and the case of man who survived after he fell 500 feet from a New York skyscraper. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s noteworthy that people don\u2019t usually survive these things, but some people do in the right set of circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cMany people buy lottery tickets and don\u2019t win, but there\u2019s always someone who does win.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Tweet email",

They say they've been left with no choice but to file a petition in order to \"honor the memory of their father, protect his legacy, and prevent his testamentary intentions from being undermined by avarice and overreaching of his third wife, Tanya Callau.\" \n \n Thicke died suddenly in December at age 69, after his aorta ruptured while playing hockey with his son Carter. \n \n The older sons claim their father acquired the vast majority of his wealth long before meeting Callau, who signed a prenuptial agreement ahead of their 2005 marriage. \n \n In the trust, Thicke left each of his three children equal shares of a Carpinteria ranch, 75 percent of his personal effects and 60 percent of his remaining estate, according to the petition. He left Callau the ranch's furnishings, 25 percent of his personal effects, a $500,000 life insurance policy, all of his death benefits from pensions and union memberships and 40 percent of his remaining estate. He also provided that she could live at the ranch, as long as she paid for its expenses and maintained the property. \n \n Now, Thicke's sons claim Callau is insisting that the prenup she signed is invalid. \n \n According to the petition filed Tuesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Thicke updated his trust from time to time, and the most recent iteration was signed in February 2016. It designated his brother Todd as the trustee, and left the estate in the hands of his children if Todd declined the role \u2014 which he did. Brennan and Robin say Callau made no complaints about the prenuptial agreement or the estate plan at that time. \n \n \"Now that Alan is dead, Tanya claims there are numerous problems with the Trust and the Prenuptial Agreement,\" writes attorney Alex Weingarten in the petition. \"Tanya asserts that there is no chance the 'Prenup' could withstand legal challenge and that she has very significant community rights in the Trust\u2019s assets and rights of reimbursement with respect to improvements to the Ranch. Tanya also claims 'Marvin rights' asserting that she had to forgo opportunities to pursue and advance her own career in order to support Alan and be his companion and partner, including raising Carter.\" \n \n Weingarten also claims Thicke's wife has \"threatened to make her claims fodder for 'tabloid publicity' unless the Co-Trustees agreed to participate in a mediation and succumb to her demands.\" \n \n The Thickes are asking the court for instructions concerning the extent to which the Trust's property is the actor's separate property and whether Callau's challenge to the prenup is barred because she waived her community property rights when signing it. \n \n \"My clients made every effort to resolve this without the need for going to court,\" Weingarten tells The Hollywood Reporter. \"The only thing they care about is protecting the legacy of their father and honoring his intentions. That is exactly what we are going to do.\" \n \n The widow's attorney Adam Streisand sent THR a statement Tuesday evening. \"Tanya Thicke has never threatened to take private family matters public and she never has,\" he says. \"It is clear that Alan\u2019s sons have chosen this distasteful public smear tactic to bully Tanya, by stirring up the tabloid media, filing a bogus lawsuit, and refusing family mediation. Tanya is still grieving the death of her beloved husband and out of respect for Alan\u2019s memory intends to handle his son\u2019s false statements privately.\" \n \n May 16, 6:00 p.m. Updated with a statement from Tanya Callau Thicke's attorney.",

Robin Thicke and brother Brennan, the oldest of Thicke's three sons, say that Tanya Callau\u2014who wed Thicke in 2005\u2014is threatening them with bad publicity unless they give her more of Thicke's estate. Thicke left much of his estate to his three children, but Callau still inherited a significant amount (the Hollywood Reporter has the exact breakdown) and was allowed to continue living on his Carpinteria, Calif., ranch. Thicke's sons say their father acquired most of his wealth before meeting Callau, and that she signed a prenup prior to marrying Thicke. They also say she had no issues with the prenup or the estate plan the last time Thicke updated his trust, in February 2016. (He died in December.) But now, Thicke's sons claim, Callau is claiming the prenup is invalid and there are problems with the trust. Per a petition the brothers filed in a Los Angeles court this week, the brothers say Callau also claims she has community rights to more of Thicke's assets, she should be reimbursed for any improvements she makes to the ranch while living there, and that she took a step back from her own career to support Thicke and help raise his youngest son. The brothers' attorney says in the filing that Callau has \"threatened to make her claims fodder for 'tabloid publicity' unless the Co-Trustees agreed to participate in a mediation and succumb to her demands,\" leading the brothers to ask a court to enforce the prenup and Thicke's will, TMZ reports.

    "document": "A 1,112-y tree-ring record of moisture shows that in opposition to conventional wisdom, the climate during the rise of the 13 th -century Mongol Empire was a period of persistent moisture, unprecedented in the last 1,000 y. This 15-y episode of persistent moisture likely led to a period of high grassland productivity, contributing fuel to the Mongol Empire. We also present evidence that anthropogenic warming exacerbated the 21st-century drought in central Mongolia. These results indicate that ecosystems and societies in semiarid regions can be significantly affected by unusual climatic events at the decadal time scale. \n \n Abstract \n \n Although many studies have associated the demise of complex societies with deteriorating climate, few have investigated the connection between an ameliorating environment, surplus resources, energy, and the rise of empires. The 13th-century Mongol Empire was the largest contiguous land empire in world history. Although drought has been proposed as one factor that spurred these conquests, no high-resolution moisture data are available during the rapid development of the Mongol Empire. Here we present a 1,112-y tree-ring reconstruction of warm-season water balance derived from Siberian pine (Pinus sibirica) trees in central Mongolia. Our reconstruction accounts for 56% of the variability in the regional water balance and is significantly correlated with steppe productivity across central Mongolia. In combination with a gridded temperature reconstruction, our results indicate that the regional climate during the conquests of Chinggis Khan\u2019s (Genghis Khan\u2019s) 13th-century Mongol Empire was warm and persistently wet. This period, characterized by 15 consecutive years of above-average moisture in central Mongolia and coinciding with the rise of Chinggis Khan, is unprecedented over the last 1,112 y. We propose that these climate conditions promoted high grassland productivity and favored the formation of Mongol political and military power. Tree-ring and meteorological data also suggest that the early 21st-century drought in central Mongolia was the hottest drought in the last 1,112 y, consistent with projections of warming over Inner Asia. Future warming may overwhelm increases in precipitation leading to similar heat droughts, with potentially severe consequences for modern Mongolia. ||||| Image copyright National Palace Museum Image caption Genghis Khan was the founder of the Mongol empire, which historians say was the largest contiguous empire in history \n \n The rise of Genghis Khan and the huge Mongol Empire in the early 13th Century may have been helped by good weather, scientists suggest. \n \n American researchers studying the rings of ancient trees in central Mongolia have discovered that his rise coincided with the mildest, wettest weather in more than 1,000 years. \n \n Grass grew at a rapid rate, providing fodder for his war horses. \n \n Genghis Khan united the Mongol tribes to invade and rule a vast area. \n \n It covered modern-day Korea, China, Russia, eastern Europe, India and south-east Asia. \n \n Charismatic leader \n \n The research shows that the years before Genghis Khan's rule were characterised by severe drought from 1180 to 1190, the study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences said. \n \n Image caption Present-day Mongolians regard Genghis Khan as the founding father of their country \n \n But as the empire expanded from from 1211 to 1225, Mongolia saw an unusual spell of regular rainfall and mild temperatures. \n \n \"The transition from extreme drought to extreme moisture right then strongly suggests that climate played a role in human events,\" study co-author and West Virginia University tree-ring scientist Amy Hessl told the AFP news agency. \n \n \"It wasn't the only thing, but it must have created the ideal conditions for a charismatic leader to emerge out of the chaos, develop an army and concentrate power. \n \n \"Where it's arid, unusual moisture creates unusual plant productivity, and that translates into horsepower. Genghis was literally able to ride that wave.\" \n \n Allied to the good weather, Genghis Khan was able to unite disparate tribes into an efficient military unit that rapidly conquered its neighbours. \n \n For the oldest samples, Ms Hessl and lead author Neil Pederson, a tree-ring scientist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, concentrated on an unusual group of stunted Siberian pines found while researching wildfires in Mongolia. \n \n The trees were growing from cracks in an old solid-rock lava flow in the Khangai Mountains, according to a statement from Columbia. \n \n Trees living in such conditions grow more slowly and are particularly sensitive to weather changes - and as a result provide an abundance of data to study, scientists say. \n \n Some of the trees had lived for more than 1,100 years. the experts say, and one piece of wood they found had rings going back to about 650 BC.",

And the researchers say it's no coincidence. They argue in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that the change in weather from severe drought conditions prior to 1211 to fertile ones afterward directly helped Khan build his empire.

    "document": "george washington Washington the \u2018Blackest\u2019 Name in America \n \n On the eve of George Washington's birthday, Associated Press writer Jesse Washington investigates why the founding father's surname now belongs predominantly to African-Americans. The 2000 U.S. Census counted 163,036 people with the last name Washington, 90 percent of whom were black \u2014 a far higher percentage than any other name. Writes Washington: \n \n \n \n The story of how Washington became the \"blackest name\" begins with slavery and takes a sharp turn after the Civil War, when all blacks were allowed the dignity of a surname. \n \n By choosing the name, he says, Reconstruction-era blacks might have been showing pride in the nation's history, as George Washington, who died in 1799, was still hugely popular at the time. Alternately, the name could have been a way to maintain ties to plantation owners who continued to be powerful regional figures after the Civil War. Then again, \"It's a myth,\" writes Washington, \"that most enslaved blacks bore the last name of their owner.\" \n \n For instance, \"only a handful\" of George Washington's slaves had his name. According to Mary Thompson, a historian at Washington's Mount Vernon plantation, the president recorded most as having only a first name \u2014 and despite the abolitionist writings he left behind, he owned hundreds of slaves. \"Washington was leading this schizoid life,\" says biographer Ron Chernow. \"In theory and on paper he was opposed to slavery, but he was still zealously tracking and seeking to recover his slaves who escaped.\" (Martha Washington's maid, Oney Judge, ran away while the family was living in Philadelphia. Washington abused his presidential powers by asking the Treasury Department to kidnap Judge from her new life in New Hampshire, says Chernow, but the plot failed.) \n \n In the end, any assumption that the name is tied to George may be a faulty one. \"There is no direct evidence,\" says Tony Burroughs, an expert on black genealogy. \"As far as I'm concerned it's a coincidence.\" \n \n But the coincidence is a marked one. According to Jesse Washington, the name is so heavily African-American that many present-day Washingtons are \"surprised to learn\" that white Washingtons exist, having never met one. In 2000, only 5 percent (8,813) of Washingtons in the U.S. were white. (The surname study was not repeated in the 2010 Census.) By comparison, Williams was the sixteenth \"blackest\" name, at 46 percent black, even though the name is much more popular, and there were 716,704 black Williamses overall. \n \n Washington: The 'Blackest Name' In America [AP via HuffPo] ||||| George Washington's name is inseparable from America, and not only from the nation's history.

George Washington's name is inseparable from America, and not only from the nation's... (Associated Press) \n \n In a puzzling twist, most of these people are black. The 2000 U.S. Census counted 163,036 people with the surname Washington. Ninety percent of them were African-American, a far higher black percentage than for any other common name. \n \n The story of how Washington became the \"blackest name\" begins with slavery and takes a sharp turn after the Civil War, when all blacks were allowed the dignity of a surname. \n \n Even before Emancipation, many enslaved black people chose their own surnames to establish their identities. Afterward, some historians theorize, large numbers of blacks chose the name Washington in the process of asserting their freedom. \n \n Today there are black Washingtons, like this writer, who are often identified as African-American by people they have never met. There are white Washingtons who are sometimes misidentified and have felt discrimination. There are Washingtons of both races who view the name as a special _ if complicated _ gift. \n \n And there remains the presence of George, born 279 years ago on Feb. 22, whose complex relationship with slavery echoes in the blackness of his name today. \n \n ___ \n \n George Washington's great-grandfather, John, arrived in Virginia from England in 1656. John married the daughter of a wealthy man and eventually owned more than 5,000 acres, according to the new biography \"Washington: A Life,\" by Ron Chernow. \n \n Along with land, George inherited 10 human beings from his father. He gained more through his marriage to a wealthy widow, and purchased still more enslaved blacks to work the lands he aggressively amassed. But over the decades, as he recognized slavery's contradiction with the freedoms of the new nation, Washington grew opposed to human bondage. \n \n Yet \"slaves were the basis of his fortune,\" and he would not part with them, Chernow said in an interview. \n \n Washington was not a harsh slaveowner by the standards of the time. He provided good food and medical care. He recognized marriages and refused to sell off individual family members. Later in life he resolved not to purchase any more black people. \n \n But he also worked his slaves quite hard, and under difficult conditions. As president, he shuttled them between his Philadelphia residence and Virginia estate to evade a law that freed any slave residing in Pennsylvania for six months. \n \n While in Philadelphia, Oney Judge, Martha Washington's maid, moved about the city and met many free blacks. Upon learning Martha was planning one day to give her to an ill-tempered granddaughter, Judge disappeared. \n \n According to Chernow's book, Washington abused his presidential powers and asked the Treasury Department to kidnap Judge from her new life in New Hampshire. The plot was unsuccessful. \n \n \"Washington was leading this schizoid life,\" Chernow said in the interview. \"In theory and on paper he was opposed to slavery, but he was still zealously tracking and seeking to recover his slaves who escaped.\" \n \n In his final years on his Mount Vernon plantation, Washington said that \"nothing but the rooting out of slavery can perpetuate the existence of our union.\" \n \n This led to extraordinary instructions in his will that all 124 of his slaves should be freed after the death of his wife. The only exception was the slave who was at his side for the entire Revolutionary War, who was freed immediately. Washington also ordered that the younger black people be educated or taught a trade, and he provided a fund to care for the sick or aged. \n \n \"This is a man who travels an immense distance,\" Chernow said. \n \n In contrast with other Founding Fathers, Chernow said, Washington's will indicates \"that he did have a vision of a future biracial society.\" \n \n Twelve American presidents were slaveowners. Of the eight presidents who owned slaves while in office, Washington is the only one who set all of them free. \n \n ___ \n \n It's a myth that most enslaved blacks bore the last name of their owner. Only a handful of George Washington's hundreds of slaves did, for example, and he recorded most as having just a first name, says Mary Thompson, the historian at Mount Vernon. \n \n Still, historian Henry Wiencek says many enslaved blacks had surnames that went unrecorded or were kept secret. Some chose names as a mark of community identity, he says, and that community could be the plantation of a current or recent owner. \n \n \"Keep in mind that after the Civil War, many of the big planters continued to be extremely powerful figures in their regions, so there was an advantage for a freed person to keep a link to a leading white family,\" says Wiencek, author of \"An Imperfect God: George Washington, His Slaves, and the Creation of America.\" \n \n Sometimes blacks used the surname of the owner of their oldest known ancestor as a way to maintain their identity. Melvin Patrick Ely, a College of William and Mary professor who studies the history of blacks in the South, says some West African cultures placed high value on ancestral villages, and the American equivalent was the plantation where one's ancestors had toiled. \n \n Last names also could have been plucked out of thin air. Booker T. Washington, one of the most famous blacks of the post-slavery period, apparently had two of those. \n \n He was a boy when Emancipation freed him from a Virginia plantation. After enrolling in school, he noticed other children had last names, while the only thing he had ever been called was Booker. \n \n \"So, when the teacher asked me what my full name was, I calmly told him, 'Booker Washington,'\" he wrote in his autobiography, \"Up from Slavery.\" Later in life, he found out that his mother had named him \"Booker Taliaferro\" at birth, so he added a middle name. \n \n He gives no indication why the name Washington popped into his head. But George Washington, dead for only 60-odd years, had immense fame and respect at the time. His will had been widely published in pamphlet form, and it was well known that he had freed his slaves, Thompson says. \n \n Did enslaved people feel inspired by Washington and take his name in tribute, or were they seeking some benefits from the association? Did newly freed people take the name as a mark of devotion to their country? \n \n \"We just don't know,\" Weincek says. \n \n But the connection is too strong for some to ignore. \n \n \"There was a lot more consciousness and pride in American history among African-Americans and enslaved African-Americans than a lot of people give them credit for. They had a very strong sense of politics and history,\" says Adam Goodheart, a professor at Washington College and author of the forthcoming \"1861: Civil War Awakening.\" \n \n \"They were thinking about how they could be Americans,\" Goodheart says. \"That they would embrace the name of this person who was an imperfect hero shows there was a certain understanding of this country as an imperfect place, an imperfect experiment, and a willingness to embrace that tradition of liberty with all its contradictions.\" \n \n Many black people took new names after the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, and the black power movement, says Ira Berlin, a University of Maryland history professor who has written books on the history of African-Americans. \n \n \"Names are this central way we think about ourselves,\" Berlin says. \"Whenever we have these kinds of emancipatory moments, suddenly people can reinvent themselves, rethink themselves new, distinguish themselves from a past where they were denigrated and abused. New names are one of the ways they do it.\" \n \n But for black people who chose the name Washington, it's rarely certain precisely why. \n \n \"It's an assumption that the surname is tied to George,\" says Tony Burroughs, an expert on black genealogy, who says 82 to 94 percent of all Washingtons listed in the 1880 to 1930 censuses were black. \n \n \"There is no direct evidence,\" he says. \"As far as I'm concerned it's a coincidence.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Coincidence or not, today the numbers are equally stark. Washington was listed 138th when the Census Bureau published a list of the 1,000 most common American surnames from the 2000 survey, along with ethnic data. The project was not repeated in 2010. \n \n Ninety percent of those Washingtons, numbering 146,520, were black. Only five percent, or 8,813, were white. Three percent were two or more races, 1 percent were Hispanic, and 1 percent were Asian or Pacific Islander. \n \n Jefferson was the second-blackest name, at 75 percent African-American. There were only 16,070 Lincolns, and that number was only 14 percent black. \n \n Jackson was 53 percent black. Williams was the 16th-blackest name, at 46 percent. But there were 1,534,042 total Williamses, including 716,704 black ones _ so there were more blacks named Williams than anything else. \n \n (The name Black was 68 percent white, meaning there were far more white Blacks than black Blacks. The name White, meanwhile, was 19 percent black.) \n \n Many present-day Washingtons are surprised to learn their name is not 100 percent black. \n \n \"Growing up, I just knew that only black people had my last name,\" says Shannon Washington of New York City. Like many others, she has never met a white Washington. \n \n She has no negative feelings about her name: \"It's a reflection of how far we've come more than anything. I most likely come from a family of slaves who were given or chose this name.\" \n \n As the creator of advertisements, events and http://www.parlourmagazine.com, she works with many Europeans, who often ask how she got her name. She plans on keeping it when she gets married, and likens her attachment to that of some black people for racist memorabilia like mammy dolls and Jim Crow signs. \n \n \"I don't exactly love it,\" she says of her name, \"But I have to respect it.\" \n \n Marcus Washington never thought much about his name as one of the few black people working in the overwhelmingly white William Morris talent agency. That changed after he filed a $25 million lawsuit in December accusing William Morris of racial discrimination. \n \n \"I'm sure that for some people there, my name triggered the thought that I was African-American, and automatically triggered biases that resulted in me not being given a fair shot,\" he says. \n \n One 2004 study conducted by researchers at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business found that job applicants with names that sound white receive 50 percent more callbacks than applicants with \"black\" names. \n \n The study responded to real employment ads with more than 5,000 fictitious resumes. Half the resumes were assigned names like Emily Walsh; the other half got names like Lakisha Washington. After calculating for the difference in resume quality, the study concluded that \"a white name yields as many more callbacks as an additional eight years of experience on a resume.\" \n \n But what about those 8,813 white Washingtons? What is their experience? \n \n For the family of 85-year-old Larry Washington, who traces his family tree back to England in the 1700s, the experience has changed over the years. (He says he is not related to George, who had no children.) \n \n When he moved to New Jersey in 1962 to teach at a college there, Larry Washington's family tried to scout housing over the phone, but nothing was ever available. \"When we showed up, there were plenty of houses,\" he recalls. After that, he taught his six children to always apply in person. \n \n Over the years, his name made him sensitive to racism: \"We just simply recognized these things, and had full sympathy with the people who were really black and getting the real treatment.\" \n \n His son Paul, who in the 1970s worked for a temporary agency in Long Island, NY, says people in the offices where he was assigned always betrayed their relief when he turned out to be white. He experienced housing discrimination into the '80s, but says that no longer happens. \n \n He is now a geology professor who has lived in ten states from Louisiana to Pennsylvania. Sometimes he wonders if his name helps him get interviews at colleges looking to recruit a rare black geologist, and if it hurts him when the college discovers that he is white. \n \n Paul's children have had much different experiences _ like his 25-year-old daughter, an English professor who teaches foreign students, whose new pupils are always amazed to meet someone with \"the ultimate American name.\" \n \n When Paul's brother Larry Jr. was recently traveling through customs in Japan, the inspector looked at his passport and said, \"Oh, Mr. Washington!\" \n \n \"His politeness and the number of times he bowed clearly indicated that he thought I was the member of a very important family,\" Larry Jr. recalls. \n \n His sister Ida, a veterinarian who lives in Seattle, says she has never experienced discrimination due to her name as an adult. She is married, but uses Washington as her professional name. \n \n \"It's very distinctive. I use it with a certain amount of pride,\" she says. \n \n Back in high school, she became fascinated with black history. \"I think my name has made me much more aware of what African-American folks struggle with. I feel in tune with them.\" \n \n Perhaps her sentiments bring the name full circle _ from blacks making a connection to the greatest white Washington to a white person choosing a name associated with blackness. \n \n \"I find it touching that freed blacks wanted to identify with the American tradition and the American dream,\" says Chernow, the biographer. \"It makes a powerful statement.\" \n \n \"I have to think,\" he says, \"that George Washington would be very pleased that so many black people have adopted his name.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Jesse Washington covers race and ethnicity for The Associated Press. He is reachable at jwashington(at)ap.org or http://www.twitter.com/jessewashington. \n \n ___ \n \n On the Web: \n \n Census surname study: http://www.census.gov/genealogy/www/data/2000surnames/index.html",

So the possibility someone getting sick because of Wednesday morning\u2019s incident is, as Water Bureau officials acknowledge, slight at best. \n \n \u201cFrom a public health protection standpoint, it\u2019s not necessary to get rid of the water,\u201d said Anna Harding, co-director of the School of Biological and Population Health Sciences at Oregon State University. \u201cThe urine, which has very few microorganisms to begin with, would be very, very, very, very diluted.\u201d \n \n Still, city officials say, any risk is too much. \n \n \u201cThe professionals told me this is the way to go. I\u2019m following their advice. We\u2019ve got plenty of water, so we will go ahead and take the safest course,\u201d said City Commissioner Nick Fish, who oversees the utility. \u201cPeople can feel free to second guess, but this is not a debate. This is the best public health decision.\u201d \n \n The second-guessing came from far and wide Thursday, including the leading advocate of a May ballot measure to switch control of the city\u2019s water away from the City Council to an independently elected water district board. \n \n Kent Craford, a former lobbyist for large industrial water customers and co-petitioner of the ballot measure, said he thinks flushing 38 million gallons is a bad idea. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a public relations decision,\" he said. \"I wouldn\u2019t waste all that water, all that money.\u201d \n \n Craford would not speculate whether the water board he\u2019s proposing would feel the same. \n \n \u201cThat would be up to the board, up to the managers,\u201d he said. \u201cOur belief is that a water district board will make better decisions than the City Council, and that they would ensure better management than what we have right now.\u201d \n \n The debate about dumping or keeping the water is uniquely Portland with roots in the city\u2019s multi-year battle against new federal mandates on open-air reservoirs. Portland leaders opted to stop fighting last year, and Mt. Tabor\u2019s open reservoir system must be disconnected from the city water system by the end of 2015. The open-air reservoir at Washington Park must go offline by the end of 2016. \n \n \u201cPolitics had no impact on our decision in this case,\u201d Fish said. \u201cBut this is Mt. Tabor and the reservoirs, and everything that happens up there is evaluated through a political prism. I know people are going to second guess. That\u2019s their right.\u201d \n \n -- Anna Griffin \n \n \n \n ||||| Update: Kavanaugh and Vocativ are now reporting that the paperwork on this case lists an incorrect last name for the man accused of urinating in the reservoir. His name is Dallas Swonger. \n \n \n \n Dallas Delynn says he didn\u2019t urinate in Portland\u2019s drinking supply, but rather on a wall next to it. \n \n The 18-year-old caught on video hanging around the Mt. Tabor Reservoir system early Wednesday morning has granted his first interview to the online news magazine Vocativ. \n \n In the free-flowing, profanity-laced conversation with former Oregonian reporter Shane Dixon Kavanaugh, Delynn said he did not urinate in the water: \n \n \u201cEverybody thinks it\u2019s funny and a joke and I\u2019m going to be on the news,\u201d he says, flicking the cigarette butt into a nearby bush. \u201cIt\u2019s no \u2026 joke, dude. I don\u2019t want people thinkin\u2019 that Dallas is dumb ass because he pissed in the \u2026 water. In our drinking water. Yeah, that\u2019s \u2026 awesome. I mean, wouldn\u2019t you be pissed about that?\u201d \n \n Instead, Delynn said he urinated on the wall next to Reservoir 5. \n \n Delynn and two friends were given written citations for trespassing \u2013 Delynn also was written up for urinating somewhere other than a park bathroom \u2013 and barred from Mt. Tabor for 30 days. Portland Water Bureau officials are working with the Multnomah County District Attorney to determine whether there are criminal charges to be filed. \n \n \n \n Delynn also told Kavanaugh he thinks it's silly to flush 38 million gallons of water: \n \n \"Like, how they can do that?\u201d says Delynn. \u201cHow can they be like, \u2018Yeah, we\u2019re gonna flush all that water.\u2019 Dude, I\u2019ve seen dead birds in there.

Or 304 million tallboy cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon. \n \n \u201cYeah, it\u2019s fucking retarded dude,\u201d Swonger says. \n \n In an exclusive, expletive-filled interview with Vocativ outside his mother\u2019s home Thursday, the 18-year-old insisted that his piss never trickled into Portland\u2019s drinking supply. He also lamented the looming reality that this story will make him a national (and international) laughing stock. \n \n \u201cEverybody thinks it\u2019s funny and a joke and I\u2019m going to be on the news,\u201d he says, flicking the cigarette butt into a nearby bush. \u201cIt\u2019s no fuckin\u2019 joke, dude.

I mean, wouldn\u2019t you be pissed about that?\u201d \n \n The night that launched the whiz-seen-round-the-world had started off on a more feel-good note for Swonger. He says he had moved back to town that very day from St. Helens, which is 30 miles north of Portland, where he had been living with his dad. Eager to shred with some friends, he and two buddies went to skateboard at Mount Tabor Park after hours, which is home to three of the city\u2019s five uncovered drinking water reservoirs \u2013 and a handful of excellent hill runs. After bombing down the park\u2019s western slope, nature began to call Swonger. It was around 1 a.m. and the three friends, along with two other people they met in the park, were near one of the reservoirs. \n \n \u201cI was like, \u2018Dudes I have to piss so bad,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cSo I just went over to the wall [of the reservoir].\u201d \n \n \u201cI leaned up against the wall and pissed on it,\u201d he says. \u201cRight there on the wall, dude. I don\u2019t know else how to describe it.\u201d \n \n Water Bureau officials, however, insist Swonger took a leek in the drink. \u201cWhen you see the video, he\u2019s leaning right up because he has to get his little wee wee right up to the iron bars,\u201d bureau administrator Davd Shaff told the Oregonian. \u201cThere\u2019s really no doubt what he\u2019s doing.\u201d \n \n Water Bureau security and Portland Police officers later stopped Swonger and his two friends, identified as Trey McDaniel and Daniel McDonald, and cited all three with trespassing. Swonger was also cited for public urination. \n \n While human pee is not a health hazard \u2013 and scores of animals piss, shit and die in Mount Tabor\u2019s reservoirs every year \u2013 the city says it will dump a total of 38 million gallons of water, even though test results on Thursday showed no signs of water contamination. \n \n \u201cLike, how they can do that?\u201d says Swonger. \u201cHow can they be like, \u2018Yeah, we\u2019re gonna flush all that water.\u2019 Dude, I\u2019ve seen dead birds in there. During the summer time I\u2019ve see hella dead animals in there. Like dead squirrels and shit. I mean, really, dude?\u201d \n \n Yes, really. In 2011, city officials flushed 7.8 million gallons of reservoir water from Mount Tabor after another man decided to unzip and rip. The Water Bureau also says that it intends to pursue additional charges against Swonger. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mount Tabor Reservoir: The city is flushing 38 million gallons of drinking water down the drain because it says Dallas peed in the open reservoir.

Jeb Bush and campaign for him in South Carolina. ||||| Former presidential candidate Marco Rubio told a group of Minnesota supporters Wednesday he is hoping one of the remaining candidates for president will stop Donald Trump from winning the Republican nomination \u2014 and that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz could be the best option for conservatives. \n \n Rubio, who dropped out of the race Tuesday after losing his home state of Florida, didn\u2019t endorse any of his former rivals in a conference call with dozens of Minnesota supporters. In the call, he explained his decision to leave the race and why he felt his presidential campaign didn\u2019t do better, and suggested he might run for office again at some point in the future. \n \n He said he saw no real path forward for his campaign after losing Florida and its 99 winner-take-all delegates. He acknowledged he could have stayed in the race with the intention of seeking the nomination at the convention, but said he would have had to run a shoestring campaign with no money to defend himself on the airwaves. Even if he had won the nomination against the odds, Rubio said, the victory could prove pyrrhic. \n \n \u201cWinning a general election with a nominee that a significant percentage of the base thinks stole it, even though you did it through the rules of the RNC, would be pretty much fatal for the party,\u201d Rubio said, though he added that many Republicans will not vote for Trump, either. \n \n But he\u2019s rooting for someone else to stop Trump from winning the 1,237 delegates he needs to clinch the nomination \u2014 someone who can go into the convention with more delegates and a better claim than Rubio believes he would have been able to muster. \n \n He didn\u2019t endorse either Texas Sen. Ted Cruz or Ohio Gov. John Kasich, the two other remaining candidates. But Rubio praised Cruz as \u201cthe only conservative left in the race.\u201d \n \n Rubio said his positive campaign message didn\u2019t match the national mood, and said media coverage helped snowball Super Tuesday losses into the end of his campaign. \n \n \u201cThis election was entirely driven by national media coverage, in many ways,\u201d Rubio said, in audio of the conference call obtained by the Pioneer Press. \u201cWhen the media narrative goes negative on you, and all the news is bad, it kind of knocks us off.\u201d \n \n Minnesota was one of only three primaries or caucuses Rubio won in his year-long presidential campaign and the only state he won. His other wins were in Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re always joking the last 24 hours at home that we need to move to Minnesota with a winter home in Puerto Rico and work in D.C.,\u201d Rubio said. \n \n The Florida senator said he had tried to run an upbeat campaign, but didn\u2019t think that message resonated in an election when \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of frustration in this country.\u201d \n \n \u201cI really believe we\u2019re on the verge of an incredible era in our history,\u201d Rubio said, but added: \u201cThis is not the greatest year for that kind of message.\u201d \n \n Describing the arc of his campaign for his Minnesota supporters, Rubio said he endured an \u201cunprecedented\u201d amount of attack ads from the Super PAC supporting former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Though he \u201cweathered\u201d those ads, Rubio said he \u201cprobably could have won Iowa if it weren\u2019t for the TV attacks.\u201d \n \n He said he \u201csaw the bottom fall out of our support\u201d after the March 1 elections, when Rubio won Minnesota but lost everywhere else. \n \n \u201cThe media kind of just said, \u2018Marco Rubio had a terrible night, and it looks like the strongest anti-Trump alternative is Ted Cruz,'\u201d Rubio said. \n \n He rejected an unidentified supporter\u2019s suggestion that negative coverage by Fox News was particularly to blame for his defeat, but said \u201cthere were a couple people on (Fox) that went full Trump.\u201d \n \n The \u201cdrumbeat\u201d of negative news about his chances made it harder for Rubio to raise money, he said, and also turned away potential voters. \n \n \u201cWhen the media is constantly telling you, \u2018So-and-so is winning and so-and-so is losing,\u2019 it impacts voters,\u201d he said. \n \n Rubio said polling showed him trailing in Florida by just 5 points last Thursday \u2014 \u201cWe were closing fast on Donald Trump in Florida,\u201d he said. But by the time Tuesday came around Rubio got blown out by 17 points. \n \n \u201cThe only thing that happened over the weekend was the constant drip drip drip of \u2018Rubio\u2019s losing\u2019 \u201d in the media, he said \u2014 as well as a Trump rally in Chicago that was canceled after a heavy presence from protesters. \u201cI don\u2019t know for a fact it had an impact on voters, but there\u2019s nothing else that happened during that three-day period.\u201d \n \n But Rubio acknowledged that media narratives cut both ways. \n \n \u201cWhen we won Iowa, we came in third place, but the media coverage treated us like the winner. We were raising $250,000 a day online,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cWe benefited from that narrative, but in the end, we were hurt by it, too. That\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d \n \n He said he is \u201cat peace\u201d with his decision to leave the race but believes he might seek office in the future \u2014 though he joked he doesn\u2019t \u201chave any \u2018Rubio 2020\u2019 signs printed out or anything like that.\u201d \n \n \u201cI remain open to public service in the future if the opportunity is right for me,\u201d Rubio said. \n \n Rachel E.

    "document": "Abstract \n \n We document a new genus and species of shrew rat from the north peninsula of Sulawesi Island, Indonesia. The new taxon is known only from the type locality at 1,600 m elevation on Mt. Dako, in the district of Tolitoli. It is distinguished from all other Indonesian murines by its large, flat, pink nose with forward-facing nares. Relative to other Sulawesi murines, the species has extremely large ears (~ 21% of head and body length), very long urogenital hairs, prominent and medially bowing hamular processes on the pterygoid bones, extremely long and procumbent lower incisors, and unusually long articular surfaces on the mandibular condyles. Morphologically, the new taxon is most similar to a group of endemic Sulawesi rats known commonly as \u201cshrew rats.\u201d These are long faced, carnivorous murines, and include the genera Echiothrix, Melasmothrix, Paucidentomys, Sommeromys, and Tateomys. Our Bayesian and likelihood analyses of DNA sequences concatenated from 5 unlinked loci infer the new shrew rat as sister to a clade consisting of Melasmothrix, Paucidentomys, and Echiothrix, suggesting that Sulawesi shrew rats represent a clade. The Sulawesi water rat, Waiomys mamasae, was sister to the shrew rats in our analyses. Discovery of this new genus and species brings known shrew rat diversity on Sulawesi to 6 genera and 8 species. The extent of morphological diversity among these animals is remarkable considering the small number of species currently known. \n \n Kami mendokumentasikan genus dan spesies baru tikus cucurut dari bagian semenanjung utara pulau Sulawesi, Indonesia. Takson baru ini hanya diketahui dari lokasi spesimen tipe pada ketinggian 1,600 mdpl di Gunung Dako, Kabupaten Tolitoli. Ia dibedakan dari spesies tikus Indonesia lainnya berdasarkan ukuran hidung yang besar, datar, berwarna merah muda dengan moncong hidung menghadap ke arah depan. Jika dibandingkan dengan spesies tikus Sulawesi lainnya, spesies ini memiliki telinga yang sangat besar (~ 21% dari panjang kepala dan badan), rambut urogenital yang sangat panjang, prosesus hamular yang jelas dan menonjol pada pertulangan pterygoid, gigi seri bagian bawah yang sangat panjang, dan penampang persendian yang panjang dan tidak biasa pada kondilus mandibula. Secara morfologi, takson ini lebih mirip dengan kelompok tikus endemik Sulawesi yang umumnya dikenal sebagai \u201ctikus cucurut\u201d. Kelompok ini dicirikan dengan mulut yang panjang, pemakan daging, dan termasuk didalamnya adalah genus Echiothrix, Melasmothrix, Paucidentomys, Sommeromys, dan Tateomys. Analisis Bayesian dan likelihood menggunakan sambungan sekuens DNA dari 5 lokus yang tidak terpaut menunjukkan spesies tikus cucurut baru ini berkerabat dekat dengan kelompok yang terdiri dari Melasmothrix, Paucidentomys, dan Echiothrix, memberi kesan tikus cucurut Sulawesi merepresentasikan suatu clade atau kelompok tersendiri. Tikus air Sulawesi, Waiomys mamasae, diketahui berkerabat dekat dengan tikus cucurut dalam analisis yang dilakukan. Penemuan genus dan spesies baru ini menambah keanekaragaman jenis tikus cucurut di Sulawesi yang telah diketahui menjadi 6 genera dan 8 spesies. Besarnya perbedaan morfologi di antara spesies-spesies tersebut merupakan sesuatu yang luar biasa mengingat sedikitnya jumlah spesies yang telah diketahui saat ini. ||||| Hog-nosed Shrew Rat (courtesy: Kevin C. Rowe, Senior Curator of Mammals, Museum Victoria) Hog-nosed Shrew Rat (courtesy: Kevin C. Rowe, Senior Curator of Mammals, Museum Victoria) Jake Esselstyn, Curator of Mammals for the LSU Museum of Natural Science (courtesy: Kevin C. Rowe, Senior Curator of Mammals, Museum Victoria) \n \n LSU Museum of Natural Science Curator of Mammals Jake Esselstyn and his international collaborators have discovered a new genus and species on a remote, mountainous island in Indonesia. This new discovery is the third new genus described by this group of scientists since 2012, and identifies a rodent with features never seen by the scientific community before. \n \n On the second morning of their field season in 2013, Esselstyn and Museum Victoria Senior Curator of Mammals Kevin Rowe set out in opposite directions from their field camp to check their traps. Unbeknownst to each other, they both caught the same type of animal in their respective traps and immediately knew they were looking at a new species. \n \n \u201cWe had never seen anything like this. It was obviously a new species. We came back to camp and were both surprised that the other one had it as well,\u201d Esselstyn said. \n \n The animal is a shrew rat with a large, flat, pink nose and forward-facing nostrils for which they named the Hog-nosed rat, or Hyorhinomys stuempkei. With extremely large ears, long hind legs that may be used for hopping, long white incisors and very long urogenital hairs, the Hog-nosed rat is so genetically different from any other species that the scientists described it as a new genus. This discovery is the cover story of the Journal of Mammalogy this month. \n \n Long incisors are a trait of shrew rats. But the Hog-nosed rat has especially long incisors. Another distinct characteristic of the Hog-nosed rat is that it lacks a jaw muscle attachment point found in most mammals called the coronoid process on the dentary bone. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t know of any other rodents that have lost the coronoid process completely,\u201d Esselstyn said. \n \n The loss of the coronoid process indicates a weak jaw musculature and a diet that does not require vigorous chewing. The scientists found that the new species eats earthworms and beetle larvae. \n \n Challenging Study Site \n \n The island of Sulawesi in Indonesia is geographically complex, mountainous and challenging to scientifically sample. Little research has been conducted on the island since the early 20th century. \n \n \u201cOn Sulawesi, there is a lot of ground to cover and most of it hasn\u2019t been surveyed before, especially at high elevation,\u201d Esselstyn said. \n \n He and his collaborators from Australia and Indonesia have been studying the region since 2010. Inundated by constant rain, the study site for this discovery was a moss-covered habitat on Mt. Dako at about 1,600 meters elevation and a two-day trek from the nearest village. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of biogeographic complexity at Sulawesi. So we\u2019re not too surprised that we\u2019re finding new things. But our team has been a bit surprised by the degree to which these animals are really novel. They are not just subtly different organisms, but really charismatically different,\u201d Rowe said. \n \n The scientists described the Few-toothed shrew rat, or Paucidentomys vermidax, in 2012. One of the reasons why scientists have thought that rodents have been evolutionarily successful is they have incisors for gnawing and molars for grinding. \n \n \u201cHowever, this rat we described in 2012, doesn\u2019t have molars and they really can\u2019t gnaw because of the shape of their incisors. Interestingly, this species has lost the two things that we think made rodents successful,\u201d Esselstyn said. \n \n In 2014, the scientists described the Sulawesi water rat, Waiomys mamasae, which was known to villagers and their guides but not to the scientific community. Villagers use this animal as a talisman to protect their homes against fire. \n \n \u201cOur guides didn\u2019t tell us right away that they had caught it. We were asleep and they were up late at night discussing whether they should give it to us or keep it for themselves. We were very glad that they eventually decided to give it to us, because otherwise we would have left and never had known about this animal,\u201d he said. \n \n These animals Esselstyn and his colleagues have described are new species within new genera, because the animals could not be placed within any existing group. After sequencing the DNA from the specimens, the scientists had the molecular evidence to confirm the species\u2019 unique distinctions. ||||| As rats go, this one is pretty cute. And until Tuesday, the world was oblivious to its existence. But thanks to the fieldwork of a research team from Australia, Indonesia and America the 250-gram animal has been discovered in the remote, high-altitude jungle of Sulawesi, Indonesia. \n \n Described for the first time in the Journal of Mammalogy, this new species of mammal is so unique that it also represents a new genus. \n \n Museum Victoria mammalogist Kevin Rowe, a member of the team that found the rat in 2013, said among the distinct features were its very small mouth, large white front teeth, big ears and noticeably long pubic hairs. \n \n Dr Kevin Rowe of the Museum Victoria, with a specimen of the newly discovered mammal species, the hog-nosed rat, found in Indonesia. Photo: Eddie Jim \n \n \"It was exciting as I knew immediately that we had a new species,\" Dr Rowe said. \"I am still amazed that we can walk into a forest and find a new species of mammal that is so obviously different from any species, or even genus, that has ever been documented by science.\" \n \n Advertisement \n \n While scientists are yet to observe a live hog-nosed rat, the five specimens caught in overnight traps boast long hind limbs similar to a bandicoot, suggesting it might hop, and long pubic hairs not seen in rats but featured on an Australian hopping mammal, the potoroo. \n \n The mouth can hardly open suggesting the carnivorous rat 'slurps' up its food - most likely earthworms, beetle larvae and other invertebrates. \n \n Meet the newest mammal discovered: the hog-nosed rat from Indonesia. Photo: Museum Victoria \n \n \"It looks like it's whistling all the time,\" Dr Rowe said. \n \n While the 40-45 centimetre animal's unique anatomy was evidence it was a new species, genetic testing confirmed it was also a new genus. \n \n The hog-nosed rat was found in the cool but humid moss forests of Sulawesi's northern peninsula, 1600 metres above sea level. The nearest village is a two-hour hike away and even that village is considered remote. \n \n The pig-like nose with forward-facing nostrils inspired its Greek-in-origin genus name: Hyorhinomys ('hyo' meaning hog, 'rhino' meaning nose and 'mys' meaning rat). \n \n Named by the discovery team from Museum Victoria, Indonesia's Museum Zoologicum Bogoriense and the Louisiana State University Museum of Natural Science, the rat's scientific name is Hyorhinomys stuempkei. \n \n Dr Rowe said the rat's closest relative was a group of shrew rats found on Sulawesi but that they were not closely related. All rats and mice evolved 25 million years ago, of which there are about 1500 known species. \n \n Geologically isolated, Sulawesi has not been connected to Australia or Asia for 10 million years. The fieldwork is part of a wider project to document and establish the area's biodiversity, long considered a hot spot of endemic species.",
    "summary": "\u2013 A newly found creature's name is the hog-nosed rat, and things don't get any more picturesque from there. Reporting on their find in the Journal of Mammalogy, scientists describe the animal, found in 2013 on Mount Dako, on Indonesia's Sulawesi Island: It's a long-faced carnivorous creature with \"extremely large ears (~21% of head and body length) [and] very long urogenital hairs\"\u2014the latter being pubic hairs. Co-author Kevin Rowe tells Mashable Australia that it's unclear what purpose the hair serves, though \"it probably helps it in some kind of reproductive way. Both males and females have those long ... hairs, like whiskers. They're not like human pubic hairs.\" Among its other features: Rowe explains that the 18-inch-long rat's mouth opening is so narrow that it can't open it much. \"It probably eats worms and insect larvae, just kind of slurping them up.\" (In line with that slurping, it also lacks the coronoid process on the dentary bone, which other mammals rely on to chew.) KNOE reports it's the third genus newly identified by the international team since 2012 (here's another of the team's finds), and recalls the moment the rat was found\u2014twice. Rowe, of Museum Victoria, and LSU Museum of Natural Science Curator of Mammals Jake Esselstyn went to check their respective traps, saw what was clear to them was a new species, \"came back to camp and were both surprised that the other one had it as well.\" The rodent was given the name Hyorhinomys stuempkei, which the Age translates from the Greek as \"'hyo' meaning hog, 'rhino' meaning nose and 'mys' meaning rat.\" (Another unusual animal-related find: a mysterious, giant, jellylike \"thing.\")",

He was sentenced to death in 2005 on charges that he shot a disabled nurse and former patient, Joyce Brannon, to keep her from testifying against him. \n \n He did not testify in his own defense during his trial. His lawyers said prosecutors told the jury his decision not to testify showed a lack of remorse for what he did. During the penalty phase, the jury said his lack of remorse contributed to the decision to sentence him to death. \n \n Mikos's lawyer said his silence did not show a lack of remorse and objected to the prosecution's tactic of using it against him. \n \n The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago upheld the sentence. \n \n The case is Mikos v. United States, 08-1280. ||||| Federal prosecutors announced Friday they will seek the death penalty for a former University of Illinois graduate student accused of kidnapping, torturing and killing a visiting scholar from China in June. \n \n In making the announcement, prosecutors alleged for the first time that Brendt Christensen \u201cchoked and sexually assaulted\u201d another victim in 2013 in central Illinois. He also has claimed \u201cadditional victims\u201d and expressed a \u201cdesire to be known as a killer,\u201d according to prosecutors. \n \n Christensen, 28, who is being held without bond, had tentatively been set to go to trial Feb. 27 in federal court in Urbana on a charge of kidnapping resulting in a death stemming from the disappearance of 26-year-old Yingying Zhang, whose body has not been found. \n \n The decision to seek the death penalty \u2014 which required the approval of U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions \u2014 means that the trial will likely be delayed for months. \n \n The death penalty was abolished in Illinois state court in 2011 after years of allegations of deep flaws in the state\u2019s justice system. In certain cases, though, it remains a tool for federal prosecutors, but its use in federal courts is still rare. It also can take years for an execution to actually be carried out. \n \n The last person to be sentenced to death in a federal courtroom in Illinois was Dr. Ronald Mikos, who was convicted in 2005 in Chicago of murdering a former patient to keep her from testifying against him in a Medicare fraud trial. \n \n Mikos, 69, whose appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied nearly a decade ago, is still awaiting execution in federal prison in Terre Haute, Ind., federal records show. \n \n The announcement in Christensen\u2019s case marks at least the third time in recent weeks that Sessions has opted to push for the death penalty. Earlier this month, it was revealed prosecutors would seek the death penalty against Billy Arnold, an alleged gang member accused of killing two rivals in Michigan. In December, Sessions greenlighted pursuit of the death penalty against Jarvis Wayne Madison, a Florida man who allegedly kidnapped and killed his estranged wife. \n \n In their five-page motion Friday, prosecutors said the death penalty was warranted because Christensen \u201cis likely to commit criminal acts of violence in the future that would constitute a continuing and serious threat to the lives and safety of others.\u201d \n \n No details of the alleged 2013 sexual assault by Christensen were provided other than the initials of the victim, \u201cM.D.\u201d The alleged assault occurred the year Christensen was admitted to the university\u2019s highly competitive physics graduate program. \n \n Four years later, Zhang's sudden disappearance rattled the U. of I. campus and sent shock waves throughout China. \n \n Zhang, who began her research appointment last April, tried unsuccessfully to flag down a bus before walking to another stop the afternoon of June 9. Shortly after, federal authorities allege, Christensen approached Zhang in his black Saturn Astra sedan and lured her inside. \n \n Surveillance video from a nearby parking garage captured the exchange in which Zhang could be seen speaking to the driver for several moments before getting into the front passenger seat. \n \n The investigation focused on Christensen after police concluded his Saturn was the car seen in the video. He initially told the FBI he was home all day playing video games on the day Zhang disappeared. \n \n Yingying Zhang, 26, a visiting scholar at the University of Illinois, has been missing since June 9, 2017. Authorities say she is presumed dead. Brendt Christensen, 28, has been charged with kidnapping Zhang. \n \n When he was questioned a second time, Christensen changed his story, telling agents he got the date mixed up, according to court records. He said he was driving on campus, came across an Asian woman looking distressed and offered her a ride because she said she was late to an appointment, authorities said. Christensen said the woman panicked after he made a wrong turn, and he let her out of his car a few blocks from where they met, prosecutors said. \n \n Meanwhile, police searched Christensen\u2019s car and determined that the area where Zhang would have been sitting had been cleaned in a way to conceal evidence, according to prosecutors. Police also searched his phone and found visits to a sadomasochism fetish website with discussion threads on kidnapping fantasies, prosecutors said. \n \n On June 29, Christensen attended a campus rally for Zhang with a girlfriend, who unbeknownst to him was wearing an FBI wire. He was captured on audio recordings describing his \"ideal victim\" as he pointed out people in the crowd, prosecutors have previously said. \n \n Other recordings made that day captured Christensen admitting to having kidnapped Zhang and describing how she fought back as he held her against her will, according to prosecutors. \n \n Earlier this week, a defense filing revealed that a few hours before Zhang\u2019s kidnapping, a female U. of I. graduate student reported to police that a man wearing aviator sunglasses had pulled up to her in a black sedan and flashed a badge. She refused to get in the car and he drove off. \n \n A few days later, the woman picked out Christensen\u2019s photo from among six shown her by the FBI, but Christensen\u2019s lawyers are seeking to block the testimony, saying she couldn\u2019t be certain because of the sunglasses. \n \n She did say that of the six photos, Christensen \"shared the most characteristics\" of the man because of his \"short, dark hair and tan face,\" the filing said. \n \n jmeisner@chicagotribune.com \n \n Twitter @jmetr22b \n \n RELATED: Earlier abduction attempt reported on day Chinese scholar went missing at U. of I. \u00bb \n \n Parents of missing Chinese scholar: 'I don't know how to spend the rest of my life without my daughter' \u00bb \n \n At vigil for missing Chinese scholar, suspect talked about 'ideal victim,' prosecutor says \u00bb",

The Chicago Tribune looks at just how rare a thing such a conviction and sentence would be. Illinois did away with the death penalty in 2011, and its use in federal court is far from commonplace. More on the case, the move, and the growing allegations against Christensen: The Tribune reports the last instance of the federal sentence being imposed in Illinois court was in 2005, when Dr. Ronald Mikos was found guilty of murdering a one-time patient who was cooperating in a Medicare fraud trial against him.

Anthony Scaramucci \n \n > Occupation: White House Communications Director \n \n Over the nearly five decades that the position of the White House Director of Communications has existed, no tenure has been shorter than that of Anthony Scaramucci. Fired in late July 2017, less than two weeks after his appointment, the White House\u2019s official reason for releasing Scaramucci was to give its new Chief of Staff, General John Kelly, a clean slate. Scaramucci\u2019s tenure in Trump\u2019s cabinet was tumultuous despite being short. The highlights included apparent protocol breaches with the FBI, conflicting statements about his relationship with then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, and a profanity laced interview with The New Yorker, in which he spoke ill of several other Trump administration officials, including Priebus and Chief Strategist Steve Bannon. In the midst of his brief stint in the White House, Scaramucci\u2019s wife filed for divorce. \n \n Source: Gage Skidmore / Flickr \n \n 2. Chris Christie \n \n > Occupation: Governor of New Jersey \n \n Governor of New Jersey and contender for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination Chris Christie has the lowest approval ratings of any governor in the country and in the history of the Garden State. It\u2019s not hard to see why. The lame duck two-term governor fawned over Donald Trump after the bombastic billionaire won the presidential election. Many speculated Christie was angling for a post in the new administration. Trump did name Christie to head his transition team, but eventually replaced him with Mike Pence. In the end, Trump decided not to include Christie in his cabinet, possibly because Christie was damaged goods. Indeed, Christie\u2019s reputation was sullied by the Bridgegate scandal in which allies created a traffic jam on the George Washington Bridge in early September 2013, hoping motorists would blame a local Democratic mayor for the tie-up. \n \n The outgoing governor said he does not care about poll numbers. That seemed to be the case last month when Christie and his family were spotted lounging on a state-owned beach while the general public was denied beach access due to a statewide government shutdown. \n \n Source: Federal Bureau of Investigation \n \n 3.

Comey garnered even more ire when, in an apparent break with bureau protocol, he announced candidate Clinton was the subject of an FBI investigation only days before the election. While some attribute President Donald Trump\u2019s electoral victory to Comey\u2019s investigation of Clinton, Trump abruptly fired the FBI Director less than five months into his presidency. \n \n Comey had served as FBI Director since 2013, when he was appointment by President Barack Obama, until he was terminated by Trump in May 2017. The White House has since provided multiple conflicting justifications for Comey\u2019s firing. \n \n Source: media.ford.com \n \n 4.

A loyal company man, Fields had been with Ford since 1989, working his way up to COO in 2012 and CEO in 2014. \n \n Fields\u2019 time at the top was limited largely due to his failure to inspire confidence on Wall Street. Ford shares fell by nearly 40% during his tenure as CEO \u2014 even as corporate revenue climbed over 5% from 2014 to 2016. Shareholder confidence was mostly undermined by Fields\u2019 determination to take on Tesla, investing in electric and autonomous vehicle technology.

    "document": "\"The Road\" is a road you'll wish hadn't been taken. Not because anything's been badly done, but because there's a serious imbalance in the complicated equation between what the film forces us to endure and what we end up receiving in return.Given that it's based on Cormac McCarthy's somber novel, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for a devastating report from the end of the world witnessed by a man who's been there, it's no surprise that the film is for the most part profoundly depressing.What is disappointing is that despite numerous strong areas, including fine acting by Viggo Mortensen and young Kodi Smit-McPhee as father-and-son survivors of an unnamed apocalypse, what we've been given is no more than a reasonable facsimile, an honorable attempt at filming an unfilmable book.As adapted by British playwright Joe Penhall and directed by John Hillcoat, best known for the slickly violent \"The Proposition,\" \"The Road\" turns out to be good at shocking and upsetting us, but it lacks the compensating emotional heft that would make absorbing those shocks worth our while.For while Chris Kennedy's formidable production design places us in an uncomfortably real space, absent McCarthy's haunting language, \"The Road\" for the most part is not so good at transcendence, at making us feel, as the book definitely does, that there is reason for us to endure its pitiless descriptions of what Joseph Conrad described in \"Heart of Darkness\" as \"the horror, the horror.\"What Conrad was likely talking about, and what \"The Road\" devotes considerable time to on the screen and on the page, is the terrors that humans inflict on each other. One of the provocative questions this story asks is whether staying alive is worth the savagely inhuman actions necessary to make survival possible.Unwilling to begin on a totally downbeat note, \"The Road\" opens with what turns out to be a dream flashback to a time just before the unspecified catastrophe happens, a time when Mortensen's unnamed man is married to Charlize Theron's unnamed woman and their first child is on the way.Ten years into the post-apocalypse, the mother is gone, the unborn child is a young boy (Australian actor Smit-McPhee) and the world has changed. It's a blasted, blighted, ashen and slowly dying Earth, shaken by quakes, lighted by out-of-control fires and filled with dead cars, empty buildings, deserted bridges and very few people.To stay alive in this world, you have to keep moving, wearing the most utilitarian rags you can find (Margot Wilson did the excellent costume design) and pushing the shopping cart that contains all your possessions. It's a vision of a world largely without us that completely chills the soul.The casting of Mortensen and Smit-McPhee is one of the film's strengths. With straggly hair and a great wild look, Mortensen is convincing as a harried survivor, and the rapport he has with the more innocent and soulful child played by Smit-McPhee is excellent.\"I've never had a better acting partner,\" Mortensen has said, \"someone I knew had my back, and he knew I had his.\"One of the great fears of those few survivors is cannibalism, something the strong inflict on the weak, and scenes that hint at that are among \"The Road's\" hardest to take.The man's greatest fear is that he will die before his son is old enough to protect himself, and the son's greatest fear, paradoxically, is that he and his father will somehow lose the essence of their humanity in the drive to stay alive. \"Are we still the good guys?\" he asks his father plaintively. \"Are we carrying the fire?\"This pair have their affecting moments, as does Robert Duvall as a kind of barely alive human lump, but absent McCarthy's transformative prose, which has a power even images can't improve on, what we are left with is more endurance test than anything more elevated.If it is to do more than horrify and depress us, \"The Road\" is in need of a finer sensibility, and that is simply not on offer. ||||| The Road \n \n November 24, 2009 \n \n Cast & Credits The Man Viggo Mortensen \n \n The Boy Kodi Smit-McPhee \n \n Wife Charlize Theron \n \n Old Man Robert Duvall \n \n The Veteran Guy Pearce \n \n \n \n Dimension Films presents a film directed by John Hillcoat.

I yanked it offline as quickly as I could. \n \n \n \n I saw the movie a second time at a press screening on Oct. 27 in Chicago. I see festival films again whenever I have the chance. I find the second viewing makes the good ones better, and the bad ones worse. Such is the case with \"The Road.\" \n \n \"The Road\" evokes the images and the characters of Cormac McCarthy's novel. It is powerful, but for me lacks the same core of emotional feeling. I'm not sure this is any fault of the filmmakers. The novel itself would not be successful if it were limited to its characters and images. Its effect comes above all through McCarthy's prose. It is the same with all of McCarthy's work, but especially this one, because his dialogue is so restrained, less baroque than usual. \n \n \n \n The story is straightforward: America has been devastated. Habitations have been destroyed or abandoned, vegetation is dying, crops have failed, the infrastructure of civilization has disappeared. This has happened in such recent memory that even The Boy, so young, was born into a healthy world. No reason is given for this destruction, perhaps because no reason would be adequate. McCarthy evokes the general apprehension of post-9/11. The Boy and The Man make their way toward the sea, perhaps for no better reason than that sea has always been the direction of hope in this country. \n \n \n \n The surviving population has been reduced to savage survivalists, making slaves of the weaker, possibly using them as food. We've always done that, employing beef cattle, for example, to do the grazing on acres of pasture so we can consume the concentrated calories of their labor. In a land where food is scarce, wanderers seek out canned goods and fear their own bodies will perform this work for the cannibals. \n \n \n \n Although we read of those who stockpile guns and ammunition for an apocalypse, weapon stores on the Road have dwindled down. The Man has a gun with two remaining bullets. He is a wary traveler, suspecting everyone he sees. He and The Boy are transporting a few possessions in a grocery cart. He encourages his son to keep walking, but holds out little hope for the end of their journey. \n \n \n \n I am not sure the characters could be played better, or differently. Viggo Mortensen portrays The Man as dogged and stubborn, determined to protect his boy. Kodi Smit-McPhee is convincing as a child stunned by destruction, depending on his father in a world where it must be clear to him that any man can die in an instant. The movie resists any tendency toward making the child cute, or the two of them heartwarming. \n \n \n \n Flashback scenes star Charlize Theron as the wife and mother of the two in earlier, sunnier days. These sequences show the marriage as failing, and these memories haunt The Man. I'm not sure what relevance this subplot has to the film as a whole; a marriage happy or sad -- isn't it much the same in this new world? It has a lot of relevance, however, to The Man and The Boy. In times of utter devastation, memories are what we cling to. \n \n \n \n The external events of the novel have been boldly solved, and this is an awesome production. But McCarthy's prose has the uncanny ability to convey more than dialogue and incident. It's as dense as poetry. It is more spare in The Road than in a more ornate work like Suttree; in The Road, it is as evocative in the way Samuel Beckett is. If it were not, \"The Road\" might be just another film of sci-fi apocalypse. It's all too easy to imagine how this material could be vulgarized, as Richard Matheson's novel was in the 2007 version of \"I Am Legend.\" \n \n \n \n How could the director and writer, John Hillcoat and Joe Penhall, have summoned the strength of McCarthy's writing? Could they have used more stylized visuals, instead of relentless realism? A grainy black-and-white look to suggest severely limited resources? I have no idea. Perhaps McCarthy, like Faulkner, is all but unfilmable. \n \n \n \n The one great film of his work is the Coens' \"No Country for Old Men,\" but it began with an extraordinary character and surrounded him with others. The Road is not fertile soil, providing a world with life draining from it. McCarthy's greatest novels are Suttree and Blood Meridian. The second, set in the Old West, is about a fearsome, bald, skeletal man named Judge Holden, who is implacable in his desire to inflict suffering and death. (\"Blood Meridian\" is being prepared by Todd Field, director of \"In the Bedroom.\") \n \n \n \n Hillcoat's earlier film, \"The Proposition\" (2005), written by Nick Cave, seems almost McCarthy-like. Something in McCarthy's work draws Hillcoat to it, and you must be a brave director to let that happen. Writing this, I realize few audience members can be expected to have read The Road, even though it was a selection of Oprah's Book Club. Fewer still will have read McCarthy's other works. \n \n \n \n I've been saying for years that a film critic must review the film before him, and not how \"faithful\" the film is to the book -- as if we're married to the book, and somehow screen adaptation is adultery. I realize my own fault is in being so very familiar with Cormac McCarthy. That may affect my ability to view any film adaptation of his work afresh. When I know a novel is bring filmed, I make it a point to not read the book. Yet I am grateful for having read McCarthy's. ||||| In \u201cThe Road,\u2019\u2019 the world has ended with a bang and a whimper. Author Cormac McCarthy\u2019s lean prose has been lifted off the printed page and laid carefully into the soundtrack like antique china in a packing crate. \u201cThe clocks stopped at 1:17,\u2019\u2019 says the narrator. \u201cA long shear of light and then a series of low concussions.\u2019\u2019 That\u2019s all we know about the apocalypse and all we need to know. \n \n The movie takes place in an America that has been turned into an ash heap, with skeletal human survivors picking their way across the cinders. Kept rigorously in the foreground are a Man (Viggo Mortensen) and a Boy (Kodi Smit-McPhee), the latter born shortly after the end came and thus a creature exclusively of this fallen world. \n \n The two are traveling from the interior to the coast before winter comes - that\u2019s the action of the movie. That, and keeping clear of marauding bands of men who would gladly skin them and eat them. Also, as the boy reminds his father, the two \u201ccarry the fire,\u2019\u2019 whatever that means. It could refer to decency and goodness, the guttering spark of humanity. It could just mean they\u2019re still alive. \n \n \u201cThe Road\u2019\u2019 has been poured straight from McCarthy\u2019s bleak bottle and brought to the screen by Australian John Hillcoat, who turned the 2005 Outback Western \u201cThe Proposition\u2019\u2019 into an epic of blasted landscapes and bloody motivations. He\u2019s the man for the job, yet in adapting this harsh, unyielding book for the screen, Hillcoat and screenwriter Joe Penhall pull their punches the slightest degree and thus too much. \n \n Or maybe movies can only dully visualize horrors the best writers hint at. Hillcoat\u2019s \u201cRoad\u2019\u2019 is true to the book\u2019s profoundly moving post-nuclear stoicism, but it can\u2019t quite get those biblical cadences that make McCarthy such a transfixing read. The Coens managed it with \u201cNo Country for Old Men,\u2019\u2019 so it can be done, but you have to be willing to go all the way into the dark. As a colleague said after seeing this movie, you need to show the baby on the spit. \u201cThe Road\u2019\u2019 doesn\u2019t dare, can\u2019t dare, and is the lesser thing. \n \n What\u2019s on the screen is disturbing enough. (Even at that, it has taken a year for the Weinsteins, the producers and distributors of \u201cThe Road,\u2019\u2019 to get the nerve to release the film.) As the Man and the Boy drag their shopping cart across what\u2019s left of America, the enormity of the cataclysm is glimpsed forward and backward. A wife (Charlize Theron) who may have been the braver for opting out. An impossibly old man (Robert Duvall) like a figure out of \u201cGodot,\u2019\u2019 unable to go on but still going on. A trap door in a kitchen that leads to something you\u2019d better not think about. \n \n There are other basements and further revelations in \u201cThe Road,\u2019\u2019 but Hillcoat avoids jack-in-the-box suspense clich\u00e9s; the movie plods with a literalism that\u2019s at times too reverent (as is Nick Cave\u2019s score, piling on a sensitive \u201cmournfulness\u2019\u2019 both redundant and unnecessary). Mortensen underplays his role admirably, and Smit-McPhee is gratifyingly unactorly. At the movie\u2019s best we see their relationship shift as something crucial and inarticulate is passed from one generation to the next. \n \n Like all end-of-the-world fiction, \u201cThe Road\u2019\u2019 brings iconic meaning to the smallest of gestures. A single kindness becomes the hope of humanity; a cruel act the path to hell. If I have mixed feelings about the movie, it\u2019s because Hillcoat honors the story\u2019s minimalism without bringing his own sensibilities to bear on the material. He\u2019s spooked by the responsibility, and maybe he\u2019s right: When the director does add a single furry detail to the final scenes, it feels like a surrender to sentiment. \n \n At the same time, everything about the film is a welcome rebuke to the happy-face apocalypse of \u201c2012,\u2019\u2019 a movie that turns mass extinction into the Greatest Show on Earth. In \u201cThe Road,\u2019\u2019 what has been lost is recognized as infinitely precious; what\u2019s left is bitter and our due. \n \n Ty Burr can be reached at tburr@globe.com.

    "document": "Gaza City, Gaza (CNN) -- Israeli airstrikes and tank shells pounded parts of Gaza Tuesday -- killing a 4-year-old girl, Palestinian security and medical sources said -- after Israel said a Gaza sniper killed a Muslim Israeli man near a border fence. \n \n The events began when a sniper in Gaza shot a Bedouin Israeli citizen -- Salah Shukri Abu Latyef, 22 -- who was performing maintenance work Tuesday on the fence separating Israel from the Palestinian territory's northern border, the Israeli military said. \n \n Abu Latyef was from Rahat, a southern Israeli city inhabited mainly by Bedouins, an Arab Muslim minority in Israel, the military said. \n \n Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office promised a forceful response, saying the shooting was a \"very severe incident, and we will not let it go unanswered.\" \n \n \"Our policy until now has been to act beforehand and to respond in force, and this is how we will act regarding this incident as well,\" Netanyahu's office said. \n \n Israeli warplanes launched strikes on and near some Gaza camps of the al Qassam Brigades -- the military wing of Hamas, which controls Gaza -- Hamas security sources said. \n \n The Israeli military confirmed it launched tank and air attacks, saying it struck a weapon manufacturing facility and \"a terror infrastructure in the southern Gaza Strip, a terror site and another terror infrastructure in the central Gaza Strip, and a concealed rocket launcher in the northern Gaza Strip.\" \n \n One airstrike struck a house near an al Qassam camp in central Gaza, killing a 4-year-old girl and injuring three of her relatives, the Hamas sources said. \n \n Israeli airstrikes also hit an empty field at an al Qassam camp near the southern Gaza area of Rafah, and an empty al Qassam training camp in the southern Gaza community of Khan Younes, the Hamas sources said. \n \n Hamas said the training camps were evacuated after the Israeli's killing. \n \n Israeli tank shells also hit near the al Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza, according to the Hamas sources. \n \n The sources said 11 people were injured in the airstrikes and tank attacks, in addition to the child who was killed. \n \n The al Qassam Brigades claimed on its Twitter account that the slain Israeli was a soldier. The Israeli military, however, said Abu Latyef was a civilian. \n \n The Israeli defense minister, Moshe Ya'alon, said Israel holds Hamas responsible for the shooting. \n \n \"We will not allow life in the south to be disturbed, and we will react in the sternest and gravest way to any attack on our sovereignty and injuries of our civilians and soldiers,\" Ya'alon said in a statement released by the defense ministry. \n \n U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is concerned about the violence, condemns Abu Latyef's killing and deplores the death of the Gaza girl and other Palestinian civilian casualties, his spokesman said Tuesday. \n \n The Israeli military said Abu Latyef was the first Israeli civilian killed near the Gaza Strip since it launched a series of attacks there last year. \n \n In Israel's \"Pillar of Defense\" operation in November 2012, the country's military launched strikes on Gaza designed to stop constant rocket fire. Eight days of round-the-clock warfare followed between Israel and Hamas. More than 160 Palestinians, many of whom were civilians, were killed. Six Israelis died, including civilians and soldiers. \n \n Journalist Talal Abu Rahma reported from Gaza City; CNN's Michael Schwartz reported from Bethlehem in the West Bank. CNN's Saad Abedine, Hamdi Alkhshali, Kareem Khadder and Jason Hanna contributed to this report. ||||| Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \n \n A civilian working for the Defense Ministry was shot and killed on Tuesday from Palestinian sniper fire, while working to fix damages caused to the Israeli-Gaza border fence caused by the recent winter storm. \n \n \n \n Salah Shukri Abu Latyef, 22, from Rahat, was working for Shabbat Drilling operating a tractor at the Gaza border when he was shot and struck in the center of his chest by a Palestinian sniper, according to the army's assessment. \n \n \n \n He was airlifted to Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba where he later succumbed to his wounds. \n \n \n \n Israeli media reported that the Palestinian militant group Popular Resistance Committees claimed responsibility for the shooting. \n \n \n \n \"The incident occurred very close to the border,\" one security source said. \n \n \n \n \"This was his first day working on the Gaza Strip border and unfortunately it was also his last day of life,\" Latyef's cousin said. \n \n \n \n An IDF spokesman said that the military had limited the access of farmers working in the immediate vicinity of the fence in the aftermath of the attack. \n \n \n \n Israel clamped restrictions in the past on Palestinians working inside the Gaza Strip near the security fence to prevent exactly the type of sniper incident that killed an Israeli defense ministry worker on Tuesday, government officials said. \n \n \n \n The easing of those restrictions were part of the understandings brokered by Egypt that brought an end in November 2012 to Operation Pillar of Defense against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. \n \n \n \n Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu characterized the attack a \"very grave incident\" that Israel would not let go unanswered. This attack, unlike the other terror attacks this week, elicited a quick and immediate response from Netanyahu. \n \n \n \n \"Our policy up until now has been to prevent beforehand and to react with force, and this is how we will act now as well,\" he said. \n \n \n \n Government sources said Netanyahu viewed this incident as particularly serious both within the context of the string of other attacks this week \u2013 the foiled bus bomb in Bat Yam, the rocket fire from Gaza and the knifing of a Border Patrolman outside of Jerusalem \u2013 and also because it was such a clear violation of the understandings that brought an end to Operation Pillar of Defense. \n \n \n \n According to those understandings, Israel eased restriction on Gazans working close to security fence that were clamped on the area because of security concerns. \n \n \n \n Netanyahu made his comment as he was just about to fly back to Jerusalem from Sderot, where he went Tuesday to dedicate the new Tel Aviv-Sderot train line. \n \n \n \n Netanyahu said that Israel would not tolerate a \"drizzle\" of attacks from Gaza that would \"turn into a storm.\" \n \n \n \n Since Operation Pillar of Defense last year, he said the south has been quieter than it has been for more than a decade. \"I am committed to maintaining that quiet, with a strong hand and an outstretched arm. That is our policy.\" \n \n \n \n The cross-border shooting comes after a spate of attempts by Palestinians to plant explosives along the security fence and to damage the barrier in recent days. \n \n \n \n Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon said there was \"no direct relation\" between terrorist attacks in Israel over the past two days and the cross-border shooting attack. \n \n \n \n \"We view take a most severe view of them. In Gaza, Hamas is sovereign, and we see it as being responsible for today's shooting from the Strip and rocket launches over the past today at Israel. We will not allow a disruption to life in the South, and we will respond decisively and painfully to attacks on our sovereignty and against our civilians and soldiers,\" the defense minister added. \n \n \n \n He advised Hamas \"not to test our patience,\" calling on Gaza's ruling regime to exercise its authority on the ground to prevent further attacks on Israel by other organizations. \n \n \n \n \"If there won't be quiet in Israel, there won't be quiet in Gaza either,\" Ya'alon warned. \n \n \n \n \"Terrorism incidents are the continuation of previous attacks, most of which are the result of a lone attacker, or one who has been influenced by the atmosphere of incitement and hatred that exists in the Palestinian Authority against Israel. This is an intolerable situation from our perspective, and despite the difficulties in dealing with a lone individual incited to murder Jews, we will act with a resolute hand and in various ways to harm anyone who tries to carry out terrorist attacks,\" Ya'alon pledged. \n \n \n \n As long as the PA continues to incite against Israel and its civilians, and fails to promote a culture of peace, Israel will have to deal with attacks that result from this, he added. Ya'alon sent his condolences to the family of the fatally wounded civilian, and wished the policeman stabbed on Monday a swift recovery. \n \n \n \n Ya'alon ordered the closing of the Kerem Shalom border crossing on Tuesday evening, following escalation on the Gaza border. \n \n \n \n President Shimon Peres said that \"Israel will ensure its own security\" and advised Hamas and the Islamic Jihad to stop aggressions against Israel. \n \n \n \n \"If Gaza wants it to be quiet, it must remain quiet, otherwise it will suffer the consequences of the unrest many times over,\" Peres said. \n \n \n \n \"Gaza is not under any occupation. It is playing with fire. The world will not continue supporting Gaza if it continues killing innocent people,\" the president added. \n \n \n \n Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein said the attack \"proves that Hamas and its satellite organizations are determined to harm Israeli citizens without any connection to their religion or ideology.\" \n \n \n \n \"The trickle of attacks must stop and life near Gaza must be stable and safe,\" Edelstein added, sending his condolences to the victim's family. \n \n \n \n Opposition leader Isaac Herzog (Labor) said he is certain that the recent wave of terror is meant to sabotage peace talks and the possibility of a two-state solution. \n \n \n \n \"We will not give in to terror and will not let it win or determine the State of Israel's interests,\" Herzog stated. \"I trust that the IDF and security forces will act against terror.\" \n \n \n \n However, some on the right did not share Herzog's determination to continue negotiating. \n \n \n \n \"The deterioration in security shows once again that the Palestinians don't want peace,\" Deputy Minister for Liaison with the Knesset Ofir Akunis said. \"This is a direct result of the Palestinian incitement against Israel.\" \n \n \n \n Knesset Finance Committee chairman Nissan Slomiansky (Bayit Yehudi) said the next release of terrorists from prison, which is planned for next week, should be canceled, calling it \"absurd.\" \n \n \n \n \"Day after day Israeli residents' lives are endangered and the government continues blindly giving in to the demands of the Palestinian Authority and the Americans. We should put an end to this farce. As long as terror against Israel continues, we cannot release even one terrorist,\" Slomiansky stated. \n \n \n \n In a separate incident, a Palestinian youth who approached the fence on the border with northern Gaza entered the closed security zone, and ignored calls by soldiers to vacate the area. He was shot in the leg and evacuated to a Gazan hospital by the Red Crescent. \n \n \n \n Lahav Harkov and Yasser Okbi contributed to this report.",

I'm very pleased to be doing what I'm doing as secretary of state.\" \n \n In a separate interview with TV New Zealand, Clinton said she hoped the United States was ready for a female president, adding \"it should be.\" \n \n Asked if it might be her, she replied: \"Well, not me. But it will be someone and it is nice coming to countries that have already proven that they can elect women to the highest governing positions that they have in their systems.\" \n \n New Zealand -- whose former prime ministers include Helen Clark and Jenny Shipley -- is the second-to-last stop on a nearly two-week Asia-Pacific tour that Clinton wraps up in Australia, whose current prime minister is Julia Gillard. \n \n In Tuesday's election, Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives, where the Republicans gained at least 60 members. As of Thursday, Democrats held on to the Senate with a 51-seat majority but the Republicans gained six seats there. \n \n The Democrats' poor showing has been widely interpreted as a referendum on U.S. President Barak Obama, raising questions about who the party may field as its candidate in 2012, when he would be expected to run for re-election, and 2016. \n \n (Editing by Sugita Katyal) ||||| Secretary of State Hillary Clinton aimed to defuse speculation about another presidential run Friday, telling New Zealand television that she's very pleased to serve as Secretary of State. \n \n Asked by New Zealand TV3's Duncan Garner Friday, \"Just looking long term, do you still rule out standing for top office, for president?\" \n \n \"Yes,\" Clinton said. \n \n Garner continued: \"Even as going as far as 2016?\" \n \n \"Oh yes, yes,\" Clinton reiterated. \"I\u2019m very pleased to be doing what I\u2019m doing as Secretary of State.\" \n \n Does that constitute Clinton ruling out a 2016 run, as the Reuters' take on her comments suggests? \n \n Not necessarily. Clinton says she's enjoying her job as Secretary of State too much to get into the presidential race. But in 2016, she almost certainly will not be Secretary of State anymore. \n \n (Clinton may also have been even more careful than usual to try to squelch political speculation about herself given the fact that New Zealand Prime Minister John Phillip Key accidentally introduced her yesterday as \"President Clinton\" before correcting himself.) \n \n In the interview Friday, Clinton also sought to defend President Barack Obama and put the Democrats' losses in the midterms Tuesday in perspective. \n \n Asked if this was a bigger than normal midterm rout such as that her husband experienced in 1994, Clinton acknowledged, \"It's big,\" but added, \"but it is not out of the pattern of historical political elections.\" \n \n \"But what I think the President made very clear was he made decisions which were essential for the well-being of the American people,\" Clinton continued. \n \n \"It may not have been popular to do what had to be done with the stimulus and some of the other actions he took on the economy, but many of us believe it prevented even worse economic consequences,\" Clinton said. \"So these things take a while for people to feel them, and I think the President recognizes that we\u2019re just all going to have to redouble our efforts.\" ||||| POLITICO's Patrick Gavin reports on \"President\" Hillary Clinton's visit to New Zealand Thursday: \n \n We all know that Hillary Clinton came close to winning the Democratic nomination for president of the United States in 2008. She wasn't successful, but some people clearly haven't forgotten about what could have been. \n \n \n \n The secretary of state joined New Zealand Prime Minister John Phillip Key and New Zealand Foreign Minister Murray Stuart McCully for remarks Thursday at Wellington's Parliament Theatrette, and the prime minister made a little slip-up. \n \n \n \n \"And we, in a purely bilateral basis, have concerns about the fact that Australia\" has a free-trade agreement, began Key. \"They\u2019re a very important part of our market in New Zealand, so we see Trans-Pacific Partnership as a very important item to be completed if at all possible. So, President Clinton ...\" ... \n \n \n \n Laughter \u2014 and applause \u2014 ensued, according to the State Department's transcript, and Key was forced to correct himself. \n \n \n \n \"I\u2019m sorry. Secretary Clinton \u2014 great,\" he said. \"I thank you for your time here in New Zealand, and I look forward to seeing President Obama when he is here in Japan next week.\"",
    "summary": "\u2013 A day after being accidentally introduced as \"President Clinton,\" Hillary seems to be taking pains to kill talk of a future run in New Zealand's media, reports Reuters. Asked whether she'd \"ruled out\" running through 2016, she replied, \"Oh yes, yes. I'm very pleased to be doing what I'm doing as secretary of state.\" Asked in another interview whether she could be the first female president, she answered, \"Well, not me. But it will be someone ...\" The significance? Probably not much, writes Laura Rozen in Politico, noting how one of Clinton's answers is tied to her being secretary of state\u2014a post she likely won't hold in 2016. On another front, Clinton said the midterm losses were \"big\u2014but not out of the pattern of historical political elections.\" She added, \"I think the president made very clear was he made decisions which were essential for the well-being of the American people.\"",

    "document": "You might think a world-famous filmmaker and author would be above petty crime. But you would be wrong! Miranda July, the twee mind behind the film \u201cYou And Me And Everyone We Know,\u201d has confessed in this week\u2019s issue of The New Yorker to a sordid history of shoplifting. Her first time stealing was during her freshman year of college when she nabbed a package of Neosporin. The minute a guard apprehended her, she wet her pants. And if you think that an incident of public peeing might have put the woman off from shoplifting, you would be wrong again! July continued to shoplift at the grocery store and even at Goodwill. (Yes, this woman stole from charity. Oof.) If you ever go to one of Miranda July\u2019s book signings, watch your purse. [New Yorker] \n \n Alas, Miranda July isn\u2019t the only celeb with sticky fingers. Here are 10 more female celebs who have (allegedly) given themselves a five finger discount. ||||| I don\u2019t remember the first time I did it, but I remember the first time I got caught. I was a freshman at U.C. Santa Cruz, the store was called Zanotto\u2019s, the item was Neosporin. I took it out of its packaging, bent down as if to scratch my ankle, and then wedged the tube of triple-antibiotic ointment into my white ankle sock. When the guard grabbed my arm, I was so scared I peed on the floor. As we waited for the police to come, I had to watch a janitor clean up my pee with a mop. I was taken down to the station and formally arrested: fingerprints, mug shot\u2014they really wanted to teach this nineteen-year-old, transparent-dress-wearing punk a lesson. The lesson I learned was that I was now legally an adult, so I didn\u2019t have to worry that my parents would be called. I was free\u2014even my crimes belonged to me alone. \n \n In time, I improved. I discovered that stealing required a loose, casual energy, a sort of oneness with the environment, like surfing or horse-whispering. And once I knew I could do it I felt strangely obliged to. I remember feeling guilty for not stealing, as though I were wasting money. After I dropped out of college and moved to Portland, Oregon, it became part of my livelihood. I stared at my shopping list like a stressed housewife, deliberating over which items to steal and which to buy with food stamps. My preferred purse was gigantic and discreetly rigid, like a suitcase. I packed it with blocks of cheese, loaves of bread, and lots of soy products, because I was a vegetarian. \n \n But it wasn\u2019t just about the supermarket\u2014the whole world was one giant heist. It goes without saying that I used magnets to reset the Kinko\u2019s copy counters to zero, and carried scissors to cut alarm tags out of clothes. Everyone I knew did these things. I say this not to excuse myself but just so you can visualize a legion of energetic, intelligent young lady criminals. Anytime anyone we knew flew into Portland, we urged her to buy luggage insurance and allow us to steal her bag from the baggage carrousel. The visiting friend then had to perform the role of the frantic claims reporter and was given a cut of the insurance money. Some friends were up for this; others thought it was an inhospitable thing to ask. \n \n My first employer in Portland was Goodwill, which, yes, is a charitable organization, and, no, I did not have any qualms about slipping books and clothes and knickknacks into my bag. Because what is money, anyway? It\u2019s just a concept some asshole made up. I also put red \u201cSold\u201d tags on large appliances and entire living-room sets, and felt magnanimous as my friends gleefully loaded up their vans. One day, a co-worker was admiring a pink blouse that had just come in. I encouraged her to take it, and when she wouldn\u2019t I put the blouse in a Goodwill bag and ran out of the store calling, \u201cSir! Sir! You forgot your bag!\u201d Then I stuffed it in the bushes. At closing time, I fished it out with a halfhearted \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d and handed it to my prim co-worker. Prim and ungrateful, as it turned out. I was called into the boss\u2019s office the next morning; the pink shirt was on her desk. \u201cThe good news is we\u2019re not going to press charges,\u201d she said. I wept as I walked over the river to the place where my girlfriend worked as a dog groomer. I\u2019d never been fired before. It was a lot like dropping out of school or being arrested. All of these institutions, in their crude, clumsy way, seemed to be saying, You don\u2019t need us, we\u2019ll never understand you, and it\u2019s important for you not to want us to. \n \n I took the message to heart. I labored obsessively over creative pursuits they would never recognize, hurtling through systems and hierarchies as if nothing that already existed were relevant to me. I performed at colleges and scanned the room for what I could take. Even a box of chalk slipped into my pocket reassured me that I still had my freedom\u2014the freedom to steal, to self-destruct, to ruin everything. \n \n There was an exact moment when I decided to quit. I was sitting on a man\u2019s lap and we had just determined that I was \u201chis girl.\u201d As we kissed, I thought, Well, I guess I have to stop stealing now. As if the idea of having a boyfriend, of being straight, required straightening out in other ways. I may have been looking for an excuse; I may have realized that I didn\u2019t need to be a criminal to be an artist. Art itself could be the crime\u2014could be scary and dangerous enough to shoulder my rebellion. After a while, I also stopped getting into physical fights, working in peepshows, bleaching my hair white, and wearing my tights over my shoes. Still, for a long time I thought my biggest heist was fooling everyone into believing that I was an upstanding citizen, a sweet girl. Then, just a few years ago, I realized that everyone feels secretly fraudulent. It\u2019s the feeling of being an adult. \u2666",

(Associated Press) \n \n The deputy commissioner also revealed a new detail that raises still more questions about what the officers involved have told investigators: The van carrying Gray to the police station made a previously undisclosed stop that was captured on a \"privately owned camera.\" \n \n State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby must review the evidence, consider charges and decide how to move forward in the death of Gray, who suffered severe spinal injuries at some point after he tried to run from police on April 12, and died a week later. \n \n Police Commissioner Anthony Batts took no questions and provided no details about the report, which he said represents the work of more than 30 investigators. \n \n \"I understand the frustration; I understand the sense of urgency,\" Batts said. \"That is why we have finished it a day ahead of time.\" \n \n Batts said police would keep probing at the direction of the state's attorney, while Mosby stressed that her office is doing its own investigation. \n \n \"We are not relying solely on their findings but rather the facts that we have gathered and verified. We ask for the public to remain patient and peaceful and to trust the process of the justice system,\" her statement said. \n \n Batts left it to Deputy Commissioner Kevin Davis to release yet another official timeline of what happened to Gray after his arrest nearly three weeks ago. \n \n In all, the previously undisclosed stop now makes four stops between the time officers arrested Gray and his arrival at a police station, where he was found unresponsive. He was hospitalized in critical condition and died a week later. \n \n Batts and Davis said nothing more about when or how investigators obtained the previously undisclosed video or learned about the additional stop. However, five of the six officers gave statements to investigators the day Gray was injured, and as recently as a week ago, the stop was not part of the official timeline, suggesting investigators learned of it later. \n \n Gray was arrested after he made eye contact with an officer and ran. Officers chased him down and handcuffed him behind his back. Bystander videos recorded police loading him, dragging his legs, into one of two metal compartments in the back of the van. \n \n Police earlier said the van stopped once so that officers could put Gray in \"leg irons\" because he had become \"irate;\" stopped again because the driver asked for an additional unit to check on Gray's condition, and then again to put an additional prisoner in the van's other compartment before arriving at the station. \n \n Now police are saying an additional stop was made before the driver asked officers to check on his condition. They said nothing about this stop other than its location \u2014 at what appears to be a desolate intersection with three vacant lots and a corner store. Last week, Batts had said the second prisoner told investigators the driver did not speed, make sudden stops or \"drive erratically\" during the trip, and that Gray was \"was still moving around, that he was kicking and making noises\" up until the van arrived at the police station. \n \n Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake sought to dispel any notion that the police report would bring a swift and public conclusion to the case. \"Whatever time the state's attorney's office needs to make that determination, the family wants to get it right,\" she said Wednesday after meeting with Gray's family and legal team. \n \n \"This family wants justice and they want justice that comes at the right time and not too soon,\" said Hassan Murphy, one of the family's lawyers. \n \n Meanwhile, protests over Gray's death spread Wednesday night to other cities including Boston, New York and Washington, making it clear that tensions over the case are far from subsiding. The demonstrations were mostly peaceful, but police made many arrests, including at least 60 in New York. \n \n Gray's death was only the latest high-profile case of a black man dying as the result of a police encounter. Similar protests erupted over the killings of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; Eric Garner in New York last year, and Walter Scott in South Carolina. Scott was shot in the back by a white officer who has since been charged with murder. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Ben Nuckols, Juliet Linderman, Matthew Barakat, Tom Foreman Jr., Jessica Gresko, Brian Witte and Jeff Horwitz contributed to this report. ||||| Baltimore police have found that Freddie Gray suffered a serious head injury inside a prisoner transport wagon, with one wound indicating that he struck a protruding bolt in the back of the vehicle, according to sources familiar with the probe. \n \n New details of the investigation emerged as police officially turned over the case to city prosecutors Thursday. Police said they have \"exhausted every lead.\" \n \n In announcing an early conclusion to the first phase of their investigation, police also revealed a previously unknown stop by the transport van driver. Officials declined to comment further on what happened but said they had obtained private security footage depicting that event. \n \n While witnesses have said that police officers roughly handled Gray, who died a week after his arrest from injuries including a severed spine, police have said a focus of their investigation has been what occurred in the van. \n \n Police also have acknowledged that officers violated protocol by not buckling in Gray and providing medical help when he asked for it. \n \n The van made several stops before arriving at the Western District police station, where Gray was found unresponsive and taken to the hospital. At one stop, the van picked up another prisoner, who was taken to the station on the other side of a metal partition. \n \n CR Market surveillance video provided police with a missing piece of the Freddie Gray wagon ride.

Batts noted that the investigation's first phase wrapped up a day before his self-imposed deadline of May 1, which he said demonstrated the agency's sense of urgency around the case. \n \n \"I understand the frustration, I understand the sense of urgency, and so has the organization, and that is why we finished a day ahead of time,\" Batts said. \"I also know that getting to the right answer is more important than speed.\" \n \n Police did not make all of its investigative findings public. \n \n State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby will ultimately determine whether to bring charges against any of the six officers involved in Gray's arrest, and she has not set a timetable for that decision. The officers have been suspended with pay. \n \n In a statement, Mosby confirmed that she had received the police investigative file but stressed that her investigation is independent. Gray's family and their lawyers were seen leaving the state's attorney's office Thursday evening. \n \n \"While we have and will continue to leverage the information received by the department, we are not relying solely on their findings but rather the facts that we have gathered and verified,\" Mosby said. \"We ask for the public to remain patient and peaceful and to trust the process of the justice system.\" \n \n Gray died April 19, a week after being arrested in West Baltimore. He suffered a spinal cord injury and crushed voicebox and had lapsed into a coma. \n \n Maryland's chief medical examiner, Dr. David R. Fowler, said his office has not completed an autopsy or turned any documents over to police or prosecutors. He said homicide detectives had observed the examination, a routine practice. \n \n \"Our first report will be final, and will go directly to the state's attorney's office,\" Fowler said. He said his office was conducting one of its last examinations and anticipated results would be available \"shortly.\" \n \n Investigative files include everything assembled by detectives \u2014 incident reports, crime lab reports, photos, witness interviews, the results of search warrants, and other items. \n \n Video of the tail end of Gray's arrest shows him groaning and his feet dragging underneath him. A witness said officers pulled back his legs and had him folded up like \"origami.\" Video taken by citizens of Gray's arrest shows him yelling and dragging his feet as officers carry him to the van. \n \n But as protests erupted, police said they were focused on what happened inside the van and did not believe the catastrophic spinal injury occurred during his arrest. Police said earlier this month that a preliminary autopsy showed no indication that force was used. \n \n Video taken by citizens of Gray's arrest shows him yelling and dragging his feet as officers carry him to the van. \n \n Many residents and activists had been eyeing Friday as a day that findings of the police investigation might be released, but police and Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake had worked the previous day to dispel those expectations. \n \n \"The family of Mr. Gray wants answers. I want answers. Our entire city deserves answers into Mr. Gray's death,\" Rawlings-Blake said Thursday. \"I ask that everyone remain patient and vigilant on this path to justice.\" \n \n The attorney for Gray's family, William \"Billy\" Murphy Jr., said family members did not expect details to be released to them this week and are willing to wait for a thorough investigation to be conducted. \n \n \"We want a correct investigation, an accurate investigation \u2014 not a rushed investigation,\" Murphy said told Sun columnist Dan Rodricks on WYPR 88.1 FM. \n \n One new piece of information did emerge Thursday: Deputy Commissioner Kevin Davis said police determined that the police wagon transporting Gray made a previously unknown stop, at North Fremont Avenue and Mosher Street. \n \n Investigators scoured that area for surveillance footage and found a private camera showing the van stopped in that area after picking up Gray, he said. \n \n \"That's new to us,\" Davis said. \n \n He did not elaborate on what that tape shows or if it was relevant to the investigation. \n \n Jung Hwang, 43, owner of CR Market on the corner, said that police came and collected footage from his surveillance system sometime last week, but that he had not watched it himself. \n \n Rhonda Sneed, 64, who has lived across the street for 17 years, said she did not recall anything on the morning of April 12, but was not surprised the van had driven down her street at some point. \n \n \"The police vans, the ones who lock up people, they ride through here all the time,\" she said. \n \n Police said that while they had turned over files to prosecutors, the department's investigation remains active and new leads would be followed as they arise. \n \n The American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland said a double standard remains for police officers who are under investigation. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

And yet Marilyn Mosby \u2014 the youngest top prosecutor of any major city in America \u2014 now finds herself playing a key role in a local drama that has gripped the country. \n \n The 35-year-old is tasked with determining whether charges are warranted in the controversial death of Freddie Gray, the 25-year-old black man who died after suffering a spinal cord injury in police custody. Gray's death has inspired protests in Baltimore and nationwide. \n \n On Thursday, the Baltimore police commissioner announced the department had handed confidential information on how Gray died over to prosecutors. The Justice Department is working on its own independent investigation. \n \n Mosby did not return a call from NBC News requesting comment, but her office confirmed it had received the police department's investigative file. \n \n \"However, the results of their investigation is not new to us,\" the office said in a statement. \" We have been briefed regularly throughout their process while simultaneously conducting our own independent investigation into the death of Freddie Gray. ... We ask for the public to remain patient and peaceful and to trust the process of the justice system.\" \n \n Mosby is a Democrat who comes from a long line of police officers \u2014 but she has been vocal about holding cops accountable in the past. \n \n \"It was important to have somebody who was willing to look at it from both sides, and Marilyn Mosby fit the bill.\" \n \n \"She has a natural affinity for police officers and law enforcement types, and at the same time, she is aware of the incredible number of complaints against the Baltimore City police department,\" said Richard Woods, a Baltimore-based attorney whose practice is primarily criminal defense work. \n \n Woods has known Mosby for years and supported her in her campaign for state's attorney. \"It was important to have somebody who was willing to look at it from both sides, and Marilyn Mosby fit the bill.\"",

One new wrinkle: Police revealed that the van carrying Gray made an additional, previously undisclosed, stop on the way to the police station, though the reason and significance aren't clear. The AP says the van stopped at \"a desolate intersection with three vacant lots and a corner store.\" (Earlier, another prisoner in the van suggested that Gray was trying to injure himself, at least according to a police document cited by the Washington Post.)",

Written by Universal Pictures ||||| \n \n POPULAR \n \n First off, I love Jim Carrey. When producer Matthew Vaughn and director Jeff Wadlow called me up and suggested we do a conference call with him to talk about the sequel to the 2010 original I was genuinely excited. Like you, I love Eternal Sunshine, Man on the Moon and The Truman Show. Carrey is an actor like no other, an unpredictable force of nature who brings a layered warmth and humanity to his work as well as that unstoppable energy he's always been renowned for. He had lunch with Matthew around the time of the first movie and dug it so much he appeared that night on Conan O'Brien DRESSED as Kick-Ass, singing a duet with Conan dressed as Superman. Vaughn and I made a mental note to work with this guy as soon as possible as we're both huge admirers. \n \n Cut to almost three years later and I'm sitting in a screening room in London watching what I think is one of Carrey's best-ever performances. I'd seen Kick-Ass 2 in many forms, but this was the absolute final cut complete with opening titles, music and a terrific post-credit sequence you're all going to love. I couldn't be happier with this picture. It's as good as the original and in many ways BIGGER as it expands upon the universe and really takes things to the next level. There are a lot of stand-outs in the sequel, every actor really firing on full cylinders and an amazing script that moves like a rocket. But Carrey in particular is magnificent. He's never done anything like this before and even from the trailer, with his masked dog sidekick specially trained to munch criminal balls, you can see that something really fun and special is happening here. Colonel Stars and Stripes is so charismatic and all his scenes are up there with Nic Cage's amazing turn as Big Daddy in the original... which made it all the more surprising when Jim announced tonight that the gun-violence in Kick-Ass 2 has made him withdraw his support from the picture. \n \n As you may know, Jim is a passionate advocate of gun-control and I respect both his politics and his opinion, but I'm baffled by this sudden announcement as nothing seen in this picture wasn't in the screenplay eighteen months ago. Yes, the body-count is very high, but a movie called Kick-Ass 2 really has to do what it says on the tin. A sequel to the picture that gave us HIT-GIRL was always going to have some blood on the floor and this should have been no shock to a guy who enjoyed the first movie so much. My books are very hardcore, but the movies are adapted for a more mainstream audience and if you loved the tone of the first picture you're going to eat this up with a big, giant spoon. Like Jim, I'm horrified by real-life violence (even though I'm Scottish), but Kick-Ass 2 isn't a documentary. No actors were harmed in the making of this production! This is fiction and like Tarantino and Peckinpah, Scorcese and Eastwood, John Boorman, Oliver Stone and Chan-Wook Park, Kick-Ass avoids the usual bloodless body-count of most big summer pictures and focuses instead of the CONSEQUENCES of violence, whether it's the ramifications for friends and family or, as we saw in the first movie, Kick-Ass spending six months in hospital after his first street altercation. Ironically, Jim's character in Kick-Ass 2 is a Born-Again Christian and the big deal we made of the fact that he refuses to fire a gun is something he told us attracted him to the role in the first place. \n \n Ultimately, this is his decision, but I've never quite bought the notion that violence in fiction leads to violence in real-life any more than Harry Potter casting a spell creates more Boy Wizards in real-life. Our job as storytellers is to entertain and our toolbox can't be sabotaged by curtailing the use of guns in an action-movie. Imagine a John Wayne picture where he wasn't packing or a Rocky movie where Stallone wasn't punching someone repeatedly in the face. Our audience is smart enough to know they're all pretending and we should instead just sit back and enjoy the serotonin release of seeing bad guys meeting bad ends as much as we enjoyed seeing the Death Star exploding. The action in Kick-Ass 2 is like nothing you've ever seen before. The humour, the characters, the heart and the set-pieces are all things we're very proud of and the only warning I'd really include is that it's almost TOO EXCITING. Kick-Ass 2 is fictional fun so let's focus our ire instead of the real-life violence going on in the world like the war in Afghanistan, the alarming tension in Syria right now and the fact that Superman just snapped a guy's fucking neck. \n \n Jim, I love ya and I hope you reconsider for all the above points. You're amazing in this insanely fun picture and I'm very proud of what Jeff, Matthew and all the team have done here. \n \n Love and Peace, \n \n Mark Millar \n \n @mrmarkmillar \n \n PS For anyone wondering what all the fuss is about, the movie is based on the content of two books, which can be ordered below. \n \n Hit-Girl: \n \n http://www.amazon.co...it-girl prelude \n \n And Kick-Ass 2: \n \n http://www.amazon.co...pd_bxgy_b_img_y ||||| Add a location to your Tweets \n \n When you tweet with a location, Twitter stores that location.

    "document": "Mirror, Mirror \n \n (out of 4) \n \n Starring Julia Roberts, Lily Collins, Armie Hammer and Nathan Lane. Directed by Tarsem Singh. 106 minutes. Opens March 30 at major theatres. PG \n \n The first volley in the froth-vs.-goth wars between two film versions of the Snow White fairytale has been fired with Mirror, Mirror. \n \n It opens Friday, two months ahead of the June 1 bow for the more sinister-looking Snow White and the Huntsman. \n \n Mirror, Mirror takes itself less seriously, presenting a pink confection of slapstick laughs and swashbuckling heroics that references the classic Disney cartoon liberally, with sly winks to the genre \u2014 right down to clich\u00e9 teeth twinkles. \n \n The story gets a 2012 girl-power update: no more waiting for a prince to save the day. Women don\u2019t escape the fairytale slap-down entirely, however; the villain is still a vain old gal who can\u2019t deal with all of her stepdaughter\u2019s fabulousness. But this Snow White will see to her own destiny. \n \n Director Tarsem Singh certainly knows his way around fantasy filmmaking (Immortals, The Fall) but can he also bring a light touch to the dramatics? It\u2019s a legitimate question in the face of the horribly overwrought Immortals. Turns out he can, although don\u2019t look for much more than that. This rambling version of Snow White\u2019s tale is a pretty, spun-sugar confection, airy as a plate of Easter egg-coloured macarons and similarly devoid of substance. \n \n Everything about Mirror, Mirror echoes old-school animation and the entire thing is gorgeous, from the high-concept snow-covered forest to a human form of a game of Battleship, where three-masted vessels nestle atop players\u2019 heads like fanciful hats. \n \n This is the last film for Oscar-winning (Dracula) Japanese costume designer Eiko Ishioka, who died in January. She and Singh teamed earlier on Immortals, The Fall and The Cell, and it\u2019s fitting that the film is dedicated to her, given the lift her work gives Mirror, Mirror. The elaborate costumes are stunning, especially the fanciful animal-themed masked ball outfits with over-the-top headdresses. \n \n Julia Roberts stars as The Queen, nasty stepmother to Snow White (Lily Collins and her massive eyebrows), sliding from America\u2019s sweetheart to icily evil beauty with ease. Easily bored and self-absorbed, the years are piling up and Queenie is hardly happy about it, using a magical mirror with a surprising inhabitant to keep herself looking fresh. \n \n The Queen\u2019s devoted servant Brighton (Nathan Lane doing a fantastic Nathan Lane) simpers and cowers as he reluctantly does all her bidding. There\u2019s no retirement plan for toadies in this kingdom. \n \n Snow spends most of her time locked up in her bedroom, missing her father, the King, who disappeared in the woods where he was likely devoured by the beast who lives there. Now 18, she\u2019d like to get out of her room occasionally, but The Queen has other plans for her. \n \n The arrival of a handsome prince (Armie Hammer as Prince Alcott) stirs the pot. He\u2019s buff and a bit of a buffoon, but the Queen sees a chance to help the kingdom she\u2019s bankrupted with her party excesses by marrying him. Too bad he only has eyes for Show White, a wrinkle the Queen deals with by ordering Brighton to drop her rival off in the dark woods to be part of the beast\u2019s buffet. \n \n Jason Keller, whose last screenplay was for the ham-fisted Machine Gun Preacher, delivers whimsy by the bucket here, teaming the abandoned Snow up with seven rebel forest dwellers who don\u2019t take well to being called dwarves. Onetime model citizens and business owners banished to the woods by the Queen for looking \u201cdifferent,\u201d they\u2019ve found amusing means to measure up and prefer to make money the Robin Hood way rather than by toiling in a mine. \n \n Among them, we meet Grub (Joe Gnoffo), who loves food, perpetually lovesick Half Pint (Mark Povinelli) and writer Grimm (Danny Woodburn). London, Ont., actor Jordan Prentice plays Napoleon, the de facto leader of the group without a short man syndrome. \n \n Collins, daughter of musician Phil, does well in her first big leading role as a lively Snow, showing a good comic sensibility. But those Groucho Marx eyebrows are a constant distraction. \n \n From the CGI-created castle to the Bollywood-inspired final dance number, Mirror, Mirror is aimed straight at the eyeballs. But it bypasses the heart in the process. ||||| Who\u2019s the Most Self-Absorbed of Them All? \u2018Mirror Mirror,\u2019 Tarsem Singh\u2019s Snow White Story \n \n Is it possible for filmmakers to still peddle the old \u201conce upon a time\u201d in the age of Katniss Everdeen, the ferocious teenage warrior from \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d? The answer, from the evidence of Tarsem Singh\u2019s \u201cMirror Mirror,\u201d a would-be comic and cheeky redo of Snow White, is yes, but not persuasively. The princess (Lily Collins) here smiles obligingly while flouncing about in a gown, but she also helps write her own happily ever after with a sword. Whether that makes her a feminist heroine or just another self-actualized Disneyesque waif may depend on your idea of empowerment. (In June the fairy tale gets another makeover in \u201cSnow White and the Huntsman.\u201d ) \n \n Written by, among others, the Brothers Grimm and waggishly retrofitted for \u201cMirror Mirror\u201d by Marc Klein and Jason Keller, the essential story is as you probably remember it, only with jokes: a widower King remarries, giving the realm a new Queen (Julia Roberts, seemingly very self-amused), and his only child, Snow White, a mother. But when the King disappears, a turn that\u2019s represented in the film by a striking animated sequence, Snow White falls into the grasping hands of the Queen, who turns out to be a pathological narcissist suffering from possible delusions. (She talks to her mirror.) You know the rest \u2014 seven dwarfs, a prince, a girl\u2019s youth, a woman\u2019s vanity \u2014 all familiar pieces that are both this movie\u2019s strength and its gravest flaws. \n \n Mr. Singh started out directing music videos. The short form suits him. \u201cMirror Mirror\u201d runs a long 95 minutes, but it\u2019s a virtual breeze when compared with his previous movie, \u201cImmortals,\u201d a camp farrago set in ancient Greece (by way of a Vegas floor show), that runs an enervating 110 minutes. Critics like to take note of Mr. Singh\u2019s eye-catching visuals, and there\u2019s no doubt he knows how to swank up performers and sets or rather hire talented professionals to do the job for him. The costumes in \u201cMirror Mirror\u201d \u2014 by turns ethereal as a dream and as ponderous as sculptured marble \u2014 were created by Mr. Singh\u2019s regular collaborator, the Japanese designer Eiko Ishioka. (Ms. Ishioka, who also designed the costumes for Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s \u201cDracula,\u201d died in January.) \n \n Yet while Mr. Singh knows how to make performers and sets look good, he has trouble putting them into vibrant, kinetic, meaningful play, which effectively means that he\u2019s a better window dresser than a movie director. \u201cMirror Mirror\u201d is consistently watchable, even when it drifts into dullness because Mr. Singh always gives you something to look at, whether it\u2019s the Queen\u2019s blood-red gown, the sailing clouds decorating her bedroom or the dwarfs\u2019 woodland home. Everything looks as if it has been meticulously selected for this or that spot, including the performers. Ms. Roberts, Ms. Collins and Armie Hammer, as Prince Alcott, look as pretty as fairy-book illustrations, but their performances are similarly one dimensional, as if they had been art directed into place instead of cut loose. \n \n The only lead performer to wiggle free of Mr. Singh\u2019s heavy hand is Nathan Lane, who plays the Queen\u2019s henchman, Brighton, and whose amusingly tremulous, cagey performance owes much to Bob Hope. Mr. Lane is the only performer who sounds comfortable delivering Mr. Klein and Mr. Keller\u2019s often intentionally anachronistic dialogue, which, with its forced lightness and scattershot jokes, makes an awkward fit with Mr. Singh\u2019s lugubriousness. All of the scripted yuks register as an attempt to modernize the movie, as does affording Snow the chance to play a role in her own rescue, mostly by giving her a sword and putting her in palazzo pants. That\u2019s nice, even if in the end it comes down to the same old story of love, glory and the devastating cost of female wrinkles. \n \n \u201cMirror Mirror\u201d is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Slapstick violence. \n \n Mirror Mirror \n \n Opens on Friday nationwide. \n \n Directed by Tarsem Singh; written by Marc Klein and Jason Keller, based on a story by Melisa Wallack; director of photography, Brendan Galvin; edited by Robert Duffy and Nick Moore; music by Alan Menken; choreography by Paul Becker; production design by Tom Foden; costumes by Eiko Ishioka; produced by Bernie Goldmann, Ryan Kavanaugh and Brett Ratner; released by Relativity Media. Running time: 1 hour 35 minutes. \n \n WITH: Julia Roberts (the Queen), Lily Collins (Snow White), Armie Hammer (Prince Alcott), Nathan Lane (Brighton) and Sean Bean (the King). ||||| Encased in a coffin, waiting to be brought back to life: That's how Snow White spends a good portion of the folk story that bears her name. There's no such downtime for the princess in the snappy retelling \"Mirror Mirror,\" a fractured fairy tale that occupies the divide between Disney and Grimm.A booster shot of testosterone lends kinetic kick to director Tarsem Singh 's visually inventive interpretation, without shortchanging the requisite froufrou or sugarcoating the story's dark Oedipal heart. The mash-up can be choppy, but the fable zings along on the sharp comic timing of the cast, led by a royally wicked Julia Roberts The screenplay by Marc Klein and Jason Keller (a screen story credit goes to Melisa Wallack) pointedly rewrites the fairy-tale convention that finds every damsel helplessly imperiled until a prince delivers her from danger. This Snow White ( Lily Collins ) can get gussied up with the best of them, but she also holds her own in a fencing duel. And \u2014 hello, switcheroo \u2014 she rescues a prince in distress.When in exile, Snow (it's a first-name-informal kingdom) receives martial-arts instruction from the dwarfs. Like the famous septet from Disney's 1937 classic, this woods-dwelling crew provides collective-sidekick slapstick, and each has a character-defining shtick \u2014 most memorably the love-struck Half Pint (Mark Povinelli). But they've also been restored to their folk tale roots as bandits and outcasts. They're action antiheroes with hearts of gold.Transforming Snow White to an action hero in her own right doesn't lessen the archetypal power of the stepmother-daughter, age-beauty conflict. Collins ( \"The Blind Side\" ) is a convincing foil for Roberts' jealous Queen, personifying intelligence, innate goodness and fairest-of-them-all femininity. If a movie-star self-regard has crept into Roberts' work over the years, here she uses it to winning effect, savoring the tension and silliness, and making an exceptionally entertaining evil monarch.Advised and chided by the alter ego who resides on the other side of her magic mirror \u2014 one of the film's more striking elements \u2014 the Queen sets her sights on an imperial merger with Prince Alcott ( Armie Hammer ), whose province's resources would save her from the brink of bankruptcy.Hammer, who brought an air of wounded regality to the Winklevoss twins in \"The Social Network\" and Clyde Tolson in \"J. Edgar,\" gets to shake off the aggrievement and let his princely flag fly, often without a shirt.Singh (a.k.a. Tarsem Singh Dhandwar or simply Tarsem) is a fantasist whose singular knack for spectacle can also be his weakness, set-piece razzle-dazzle not infrequently overwhelming the characters in his previous films: \"The Cell,\" \"The Fall\" and \"Immortals.\" That weakness reveals itself in \"Mirror Mirror\" when he stops the story cold to indulge in a puppet sequence.But mostly the built-in structure of a well-known tale helps to rein him in, as does the propulsive rhythm of one-liners \u2014 some of the best are delivered with panache by Nathan Lane and Robert Emms, as mouthy servants. For most of its running time, the film strikes the right balance of make-believe enchantment and snark-infused lampoon, playing to older kids and adults alike.Crucial to the movie's magic are Tom Foden's lush and witty production design and the splendid costumes by Eiko Ishioka, the renowned designer's final screen work before her death in January. The finery and regalia of their contributions are integral to Singh's vision, giving this mostly conventional princess story its fair share of romantic froth and more than a little moxie. ||||| Mirror Mirror \n \n March 28, 2012 \n \n Cast & Credits The Queen Julia Roberts \n \n Snow White Lily Collins \n \n Prince Alcott Armie Hammer \n \n Brighton Nathan Lane \n \n Napoleon Jordan Prentice \n \n Half Pint Mark Povinelli \n \n Grub Joe Gnoffo \n \n Grimm Danny Woodburn \n \n Wolf Sebastian Saraceno \n \n Butcher Martin Klebba \n \n Chuckles Ronald Lee Clark \n \n Charles Renbock Robert Emms \n \n Baker Margaret Mare Winningham \n \n Baron Michael Lerner \n \n King Sean Bean \n \n \n \n Relativity Media presents a film directed by Tarsem Singh. Screenplay by Marc Klein and Jason Keller, based on stories by the Brothers Grimm. Running time: 106 minutes. MPAA rating: PG (some fantasy action and mild rude humor). Printer-friendly \u00bb \n \n E-mail this to a friend \u00bb \n \n \"Mirror Mirror\" is a sumptuous fantasy for the eyes and a pinball game for the mind, as story elements collide and roll around bumping into each other. This is not a faithful retelling of the versions by the Brothers Grimm or Walt Disney, but neither is it a satire, nor much of a story in its own right. But it's great to look at. If there's a major difference from the earlier versions, it's how this one has beefed-up roles for the seven dwarves, who here seem to be a merry band in search of Robin Hood. Nor do I recall earlier battles with a giant winged griffin. \n \n The look of the film owes everything to the director, Tarsem Singh, an India-born former TV commercial maker, famous for two of the best-looking movies I've ever seen, \"The Cell\" (2000) and \"The Fall\" (2006). He's in love with spectacular landscapes and architecture, and in all of his films (including the underwhelming \"The Immortals\" in 2011) the costumes of the late Japanese designer Eiko Ishioka dominate every scene they're in and every character they're worn by. \n \n \n \n Julia Roberts seems particularly well-suited to wear them, and when first seen is wearing a magnificent orange gown and seated on a seashell throne which acts as a frame and a continuation of the costume. Roberts plays the Queen in a kingdom we're introduced to by her opening narration -- which uses animated dolls figures to fill us in on her early life, during which she was married to a King (Sean Bean) who promptly set off into the forest and was not seen again. That left her as the autocratic ruler of a kingdom with painfully high taxes, and the stepmother of Snow White (Lily Collins), who is a captive in the castle until she's 18. \n \n \n \n There is a financial crisis. Brighton (Nathan Lane), her aide and accountant, tells her she's broke. That comes at an inconvenient time, because Prince Alcott (Armie Hammer) has wandered into the kingdom, and the Queen knows if she marries him, he can solve her finances. Problem is, she can't even afford the royal ball at which she plans for them to fall in love. \n \n \n \n The Prince has already met Snow White; they were both wandering in the woods when they encountered the seven dwarfs, jolly bandits with good hearts. It is Snow White and not the Prince in this version who bestows a life-changing kiss. It's almost uncanny in some scenes here, how Lily Collins (daughter of Phil Collins) looks like Audrey Hepburn. \n \n \n \n She's all sweet, all innocent, but Julia Roberts steals the show with her imperious and autocratic Queen. She consults her own image in a mirror, located as only Tarsem would place it in a weird structure in the middle of a lake. She never asks who is the fairest of them all, and thus never has to hear the inevitable answer, but the Queen's vanity and fear of aging give Roberts some plum scenes. Consider the one where she's having a spa-style beauty makeover before the ball. Her lips become bee-stung with the help of real bees, she gets a manicure from disgusting wormy creatures, and her skin is refreshed with a preparation made up from parrot droppings. Yes, parrot droppings, and we see the parrots dropping them. \n \n \n \n All of this is in place and looks great, but the dialogue is rather flat, the movie sort of boring, and there's not much energy in the two places it should really be felt: Between the Queen and Snow White, and between Snow and the Prince. The story is a listless tale that moves at a stately pace through settings that could have supported fireworks. Indeed, the characters who seem to care the most about each other are the dwarfs.",
    "summary": "\u2013 The latest retelling of Snow White (before June's Snow White and the Huntsman) is a lot like its vain queen: visually stunning, but kind of shallow. Critics aren't particularly impressed with Mirror Mirror: Though director Tarsem Singh \"knows how to make performers and sets look good, he has trouble putting them into vibrant, kinetic, meaningful play,\" notes Manohla Dargis in the New York Times. That \"effectively means that he\u2019s a better window dresser than a movie director.\" In the Toronto Star, Linda Barnard agrees. \"Everything about Mirror Mirror echoes old-school animation and the entire thing is gorgeous,\" she notes. It's \"a pretty, spun-sugar confection, airy as a plate of Easter egg-colored macarons and similarly devoid of substance.\" The script doesn't hold up to the visuals, writes Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times. \"The dialogue is rather flat, the movie sort of boring,\" he notes. It's \"a listless tale that moves at a stately pace through settings that could have supported fireworks.\" In the Los Angeles Times, however, Sheri Linden sees a lot to like. \"The fable zings along on the sharp comic timing of the cast, led by a royally wicked Julia Roberts\" as the queen. It's \"a fractured fairy tale that occupies the divide between Disney and Grimm.\"",

Cruz, of course, is the Republican incumbent hoping to keep his Senate seat, while O'Rourke is a 45-year-old three-term congressman mounting a surprisingly strong challenge. A new poll by Emerson College out this week has the race in a statistical dead heat, reports the Hill, which notes that Texas has not elected a Democrat to the Senate in three decades. Here's a look at the latest, including O'Rourke's growing national profile: Rock star: The Texas GOP tweeted an old photo of O'Rourke this week showing him back in the '90s with his old punk band, Foss. The photo was meant to mock O'Rourke, and some Republicans think it did just that. \"Wearing a dress?\" tweeted one strategist. But an analysis at the Washington Post thinks the photo actually endeared O'Rourke to far more people than it alienated. His \"rock-star status is cemented by Texas GOP, handing Dems an icon they desperately need,\" reads the headline. Oh, he skateboards, too.",

Believe me. I\u2019ve been there. Unemployment is a bitch, and it\u2019s not necessarily your \u201cfault\u201d that it\u2019s where you\u2019re at.

And hey, she can still capitalize off of her reality fame in her new line of work, right? \n \n She might even be able to use her new gig to springboard back into television. I hear Extreme Couponing is pretty hot these days. Maybe they could use her couponing expertise? \n \n Lucia Peters is BettyConfidential\u2019s associate editor. ||||| \n \n Kate Gosselin: coupon expert. (Andy Kropa - GETTY IMAGES) \n \n When Kate Gosselin\u2019s reality show \u201cKate Plus 8\u201d got canceled in August, many of you were concerned about her potential employment options. \n \n All right, fine. You weren\u2019t really that concerned. You were actually overjoyed. \n \n Still, Gosselin is a mom, like many of us, and she needs to support her kids. Which is why I am happy to find out that she has a new job: She is now a coupon blogger for the Web site CouponCabin.com. \n \n CouponCabin.com announced the news in a press release that conveyed the Web site\u2019s excitement over its new hire, who is \u201ca longtime advocate of couponing.\u201d \n \n \u201cKate has embraced coupons her entire life,\u201d said Jackie Warrick, president at CouponCabin.com, according to the press release. \u201cWe look forward to sharing the unique insight she has gained over the years.\u201d \n \n Added Gosselin: \u201cNo matter what your financial situation is, there\u2019s no reason not to use coupons. It\u2019s like free money in your pocket!\u201d \n \n The former reality star will begin her new job officially on Nov. 22, at which time she will blog about how to navigate Black Friday. Future topics, according to the press release, include how to stretch a budget for a large family and holiday shopping tips. \n \n Chuckle heartily over this tidbit all you like, but I genuinely think this is great news for three reasons. \n \n 1. It keeps Gosselin\u2019s kids off of television . . . at least for now. \n \n As previously noted, a mom\u2019s got to eat and she needs to make sure her children do, too. If she can do that by writing about the best way to save cash on detergent or action figures, what\u2019s the harm? Of course, the CouponCabin.com blogging gig may not be enough to pay the bills. I mean, we can\u2019t all engage in the mindblowingly lucrative work of blogging about celebrities and pop culture. (I just typed that sentence while gazing at my diamond-encrusted fingernails as they tappa-tapped on my keyboard, which is made out of genuine leather and features function keys ensconced in imported silk.) But even if this keeps her busy and semi-compensated for a while \u2014 and less focused on the new TV deal she said she wants earlier this week on \u201cThe View\u201d \u2014 this is a good thing. \n \n 2. Her blog entries may provide fodder for Celebritology blog entries that compare Gosselin\u2019s shopping tips to Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s shopping tips from Goop. \n \n And the comments on those Celebritology posts will be so rich with gleeful sarcasm that they may incite a phenomenon scientists have long predicted: the Big Snark Bang. Sure, both the blogosphere and the universe may immediately combust as a result. But it will be worth it. \n \n 3. As a result of Gosselin\u2019s new job, CouponCabin.com just got a lot more publicity. \n \n And that\u2019s super-exciting because, as Gosselin noted in the aforementioned press release, CouponCabin.com is the place where you can easily find the best deals on practically everything. \n \n And there are two things we all need more of in these challenging times: great deals on practically everything and Kate Gosselin. ||||| Kate Gosselin can ease up on the \"freaking out\": The out-of-work reality star has a job now -- a part-time gig, at least. \n \n Gosselin, whose \"Kate Plus 8\" reality show took its last breath in September, will be a contributing blogger for click-and-save website Coupon Cabin. \n \n \"I've never quit a job in my life without having something else lined up,\" she told People at the time. \"I don't know what's next.\" She had been considering going back to nursing, but didn't see how that was going to allow her to provide for her eight kidlets. \n \n (Note: Kate confirmed Monday on \"The View\" that a return to nursing was a no-go, as she'd found her calling on TV. She was, at the time, dressed as a zombie.) \n \n Turns out her path from no money to mo' money will be paved in part with what she calls \"free money.\" \n \n \"No matter what your financial situation is, there's no reason not to use coupons,\" she said in a statement this week. \"It's like free money in your pocket! I'm thrilled to lend my expertise.\" \n \n Her first day on the job is Nov. 22, when she'll discuss how to navigate Black Friday shopping. Using, we assume, coupons -- which she might want to get used to, if she's going to live off a blogger's paycheck. \n \n RELATED: \n \n The hedgehog is dead: Meet Kate Gosselin's special new hair \n \n Kate Gosselin 'freaking out' with 8 kids, no reality-TV show [Poll] \n \n Kate Gosselin gets a tip from ex-husband Jon: Reality TV is not a career \n \n -- Christie D'Zurilla \n \n Twitter.com/dzurillaville \n \n Photo: Kate Gosselin visits a radio show at SiriusXM Studio in New York on Oct. 27, 2011 in New York City.

But Merriam-Webster has a less discussed word on its mind that is apparently also on the minds of many dictionary users: Fascism. \n \n Fascism, as of Nov. 29, was Merriam-Webster's most-looked-up word of the year, which means it's the leading candidate for the dictionary's annual \"word of the year.\" \n \n The folks behind the Merriam-Webster Twitter account are not happy with this, and on Tuesday they tried to get followers behind a campaign to look up other words. \n \n 'Fascism' is still our #1 lookup. \n \n \n \n # of lookups = how we choose our Word of the Year. \n \n \n \n There's still time to look something else up. \u2014 Merriam-Webster (@MerriamWebster) November 29, 2016 \n \n Merriam-Webster fans could, of course, just look up any word they wanted in hopes that one of their favorites would rise to the top. \n \n However, the team are trying to streamline support to dethrone \"fascism.\" \n \n @MerriamWebster @samanthavicent I've searched \"puppies\" 523 times in the past 30 minutes.

The runoffs have also removed gold out of the old abandoned mines and sent it down the river. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s going to bring down more gold,\u201d said Thomas. \u201cIt\u2019s going to bring up new areas that I never got to.\u201d \n \n Thomas runs tour groups through his property and said now is the optimum time for gold hunting because the storms have just finished churning the landscape. \n \n Officials from the Bureau of Land Management say the erosion \u201cconcentrates\u201d the gold by removing the lighter rock and soil. \n \n You may be wondering if this reporter found any during our time here. We did find some fine flakes of what they call \u201cflour gold\u201d and it was found more quickly than normal in just a couple of panning sessions. \n \n \u201cEureka!\u201d said Thomas.\u201dThat\u2019s hard to do.\u201d \n \n But not as hard this year, now that Mother Nature has shaken up the motherlode. \n \n Thomas said one hot spot this year will be below the Oroville Dam, because the huge water releases from the spillway could reveal some new pockets of gold. ||||| Joey Wilson, left, rings up Curtis Barwick for a gold pan and a portable slough Saturday at Adventures in Prospecting in downtown Oroville. Dan Reidel \u2014 Enterprise-Record \n \n Oroville >> Now is not the time to quit your day job in hopes of striking it rich. However, people with a new or renewed interest in gold mining may be spending more of their summer weekends near rivers and streams. \n \n Joey Wilson owns Adventures in Prospecting in Oroville, where he says there\u2019s been more excitement among his gold mining customers. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s always been gold in the Feather River,\u201d he said. What\u2019s new is that the recent floods have moved things around. \n \n It\u2019s not just the Feather River. Floods scoured the banks of the American River, the Mokelumne, the Yuba and just about any other waterway where 49ers once got their boots dirty. \n \n Curtis Barwick was in Oroville Saturday waiting for the prospecting store to open. He usually looks for gold closer to his home in Anderson, but decided to check out Oroville on his day off. He said gold mining gets him outdoors and helps him \u201crecharge,\u201d after a stressful week at work. It\u2019s a lot like hiking, another of his hobbies, but with gold mining there\u2019s a chance of a reward. \n \n \u201cThe odds are greater than winning the lottery,\u201d he said. Even on days when he only finds a few flakes, it\u2019s fun to turn over rocks and sand. \n \n He\u2019s not alone. In fact, he\u2019s a member of the Shasta Miners and Prospectors Association. \n \n Back in the day, miners in the 1850s did not have metal detectors. Barwick bought one a while back and said if \u201clead was gold, I\u2019d be rich.\u201d He had found more bullet casings than he cares to collect. Other finds include coins, and a 1944 nickel. He gave his girlfriend a ring he found in the dirt, and would recommend that anyone who buys a metal detector have some fun digging around in their own backyard. \n \n Others make gold mining an adventure. That\u2019s one of the reasons Wilson named his shop \u201cAdventures in Prospecting.\u201d He sells wet suits and fins, and personally loves to dive when he hunts gold. \n \n Finding gold is a common thread for Cindy and Paul Pekarek, who were at the Montgomery Street miner\u2019s supply shop Saturday. The couple belong to the Mother Lode Goldhounds, near Grass Valley, and for fun they travel to new digs, including Oroville. \n \n Paul Pekarek is a five-time gold mining champion, he said pointing to a pin on his wide-brimmed, black leather hat. The pin includes a miniature gold pan, pickaxe and shovel, with a real glob of gold in the center. To win the championships, he proved he could pan faster than most others. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Some people, like Mark Saposnik, are \u201cpretty serious\u201d about gold mining. Saposnik spent his summers during college dredge mining. It\u2019s more difficult to find gold now that dredging is no longer allowed, he said. The recent floods have \u201crearranged the rivers,\u201d he said, and he\u2019ll spend more time stomping around. \n \n Spillway gold? \n \n Gold miners can speculate all they want about gold that may or may not have washed down the hillside near the Oroville spillway. Before hydraulic mining was outlawed, hillsides up and down the river were washed away to unearth gold. \n \n Gold is heavy, and prospectors would love to discover what is among the debris at the Diversion Pool. However, the area is closed except for the work crew. \n \n Recent word from Department of Water Resources acting director Bill Croyle was that he did not know if gold had been found in the area. \n \n It\u2019s a moot point because \u201cif anybody gets close to it they will be run off,\u201d said Bob Van Camp, known locally as \u201cDigger Bob.\u201d \n \n Van Camp was the spokesman in 2014 when a 5.18 pound gold nugget was found in the Butte foothills. The man who found the nugget has remained anonymous, but Van Camp was allowed to tell the story. \n \n As for the spillway debris, Van Camp said he believes there is a gold vein that runs from Potter\u2019s Ravine and south, including the area of the spillway. \n \n In addition to panning near waterways, prospectors look for quartz, especially chunks that have been worn smooth by water flow. \u201cThen you go downstream.\u201d \n \n He\u2019ll also walk the higher ground with a metal detector, hoping some of that quartz will give him a strong signal. \n \n Ninety-nine percent of the time the quartz is just quartz, but \u201cnow and again,\u201d the quartz will have \u201csome sort of metal in it.\u201d This might mean manganese or silver, \u201cor there may be gold inside.\u201d \n \n Part of the fun in finding gold is knowing it\u2019s something that an old-time gold miner missed, Van Camp said. \u201cI don\u2019t do it for the money. I just do it for the adventure, for the challenge.\u201d \n \n He would love to get his hands dirty in the Diversion Pool at Lake Oroville right now. However, he understands that DWR is working night and day to get the water flow back to normal. \n \n People will be looking at other areas, where gold panning is allowed. After the floods of the mid 1990s, \u201cit was good getting for those of us who knew how to look,\u201d he said. \n \n For an amateur, the adventure could lead to frustration. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to discourage people from learning about history, getting some fresh air and enjoying themselves, even if they don\u2019t find anything.\u201d \n \n Right now, the water is still high. When dry times arrive, more streambed will be exposed, he said. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m going to have a ball this summer.\u201d \n \n Know the rules \n \n The rules have changed for gold miners. Suction dredge equipment is no longer allowed, which includes \u201cmechanized or motorized\u201d systems for removing material from the water. \n \n Contact reporter Heather Hacking at 896-7758.",
    "summary": "\u2013 This winter's flooding in Northern California has done more than bring relief after years of drought; it's created the prospect of the best gold prospecting in 20 years. Gold hunters in the area tell the Chico Enterprise-Record the floods have \"rearranged the rivers\" and \"move things around.\" That means gold veins that have been hidden for 200 years are suddenly exposed. According to CBS San Francisco, the floods also swept gold out of abandoned mines and washed it downriver. While KCRA reports that gold can simply be picked off the ground following major flooding, the best prospecting will come in the summer months when the water has receded. Right now, rivers are still high and government workers are trying to keep would-be prospectors away while they get things under control. But in the summer\u2014which experts say could be the busiest since the one that followed major flooding in 1997\u2014stream beds will be exposed for better gold hunting. \"I'm going to have a ball,\" one prospector tells the Chico newspaper. The epicenter for the new gold rush could be the Oroville Dam, which nearly catastrophically flooded this winter and required the use of an emergency spillway for the first time.

There, flashing up on the screen, was an Instagram photograph posted by his eldest son, the actor Oliver Hudson \u2013 his first-born child with ex-wife Goldie Hawn and brother of Bill\u2019s older daughter Kate. \n \n Scroll down for video \n \n Ex: In a searingly raw interview with The Mail on Sunday last night, Bill Hudson (pictured) veering between tears of sadness and flashes of anger, vowed to \u2018break all ties\u2019 with his eldest children, actors Kate and Oliver \n \n Children: Goldie Hawn pictured with her daughter, Kate Hudson, (left) and son Oliver Hudson, (right) \n \n Taken more than 30 years ago, it showed a smiling Oliver and Kate as happy children, posing with their father. \n \n It was the caption beneath the photograph that cut Bill\u2019s heart to the quick. Addressing his message to his sister, Oliver wrote: \u2018Happy Abandonment Day....@katehudson.\u2019 \n \n The post went viral, spawning thousands of comments as social media seethed with debate about absent fathers and whether being a biological father automatically earns a man the right to be called \u2018dad\u2019. \n \n Almost Famous actress Kate twisted the knife further by posting an intimate black and white photograph of herself alongside Goldie\u2019s long-term love Kurt Russell saying: \u2018Pa, just simply... thank you. Happy Father\u2019s Day. I love you to the moon and back.\u2019 \n \n The offending tweet: Oliver Hudson posted this picture of his father Bill, and sister Kate on Father's Day \n \n An undated photograph of Bill Hudson and Goldie Hawn - they went on to have two children together \n \n And as if to rub salt into Bill\u2019s wounds, Oliver, too, posted a picture of himself with Kurt, adding the words: \u2018Happy Father\u2019s Day, Pa.\u2019 \n \n For Bill, the anguish slowly turned to anger as the headlines raged and his \u2018phone rang off the hook\u2019. \n \n But he has maintained a dignified silence \u2013 until now. \n \n In a searingly raw interview with The Mail on Sunday last night, Bill, veering between tears of sadness and flashes of anger, vowed to \u2018break all ties\u2019 with his eldest children. \n \n \u2018I say to them now, \u2018\u201cI set you free,\u201d he pronounced, his voice breaking. \u2018I had five birth children but I now consider myself a father of three. I no longer recognise Oliver and Kate as my own. \n \n \u2018I would ask them to stop using the Hudson name. They are no longer a part of my life. Oliver\u2019s Instagram post was a malicious, vicious, premeditated attack. He is dead to me now. As is Kate. I am mourning their loss even though they are still walking this earth.\u2019 \n \n Kate twisted the knife by posting an intimate photograph of herself alongside Goldie\u2019s long-term love Kurt Russell saying: \u2018Pa, just simply... thank you. Happy Father\u2019s Day. I love you to the moon and back' \n \n Oliver, too, posted a picture of himself with Kurt, adding the words: \u2018Happy Father\u2019s Day, Pa' \n \n It is a sad denouement to a decades-long family saga which, Bill says, \u2018is more messed up and sad than any Hollywood screenplay could ever be\u2019. \n \n For years, Bill and former wife Goldie have bickered publicly about Goldie\u2019s claims that he all but abandoned the two famous siblings. \n \n Last night, in a blistering attack on Goldie, Tinseltown\u2019s favourite \u2018ditzy blonde\u2019, Bill accused her of \u2018wilfully alienating\u2019 him from their two children. \n \n At the heart of the matter is what Bill calls the \u2018Hollywoodisation\u2019 of Goldie\u2019s story. \n \n \u2018When we split up, she never had a bad word to say about me,\u2019 he says. \u2018But when Kurt came on the scene, the narrative changed and I became the big, bad wolf. I would say to her \u201cGoldie, why are you trashing me and saying I\u2019m an absent father when it\u2019s simply not the case?\u201d and she\u2019d laugh and go \u201cOh Bill, you know it makes for a better story\u201d.\u2019 \n \n Eventually, Bill says, the fiction became fact as first Kate, now 36, and then Oliver, 38, \u2018drifted away\u2019 from him and rejected his repeated pleas to remain part of their lives. He lays the blame at Goldie\u2019s door. I believe the drip, drip, drip of poison which started when they were kids finally took hold,\u2019 he says. \u2018Goldie wanted to create this myth of a perfect family with Kurt and she wanted me out.\u2019 \n \n Goldie Hawn and Bill Hudson in happier times. For years, Bill and former wife Goldie have bickered publicly about Goldie\u2019s claims that he all but abandoned the two famous siblings \n \n Things came to a final showdown a week ago with Oliver\u2019s bitter post. \n \n \u2018That was like a dagger to the heart,\u2019 says Bill as he sits in the sun-dappled courtyard of a hotel near his ranch home in Malibu, California. \u2018It\u2019s time for the truth to come out.\u2019 \n \n At 65, Bill still has the rugged good looks and easy charm that captivated Goldie when she was at the height of her fame. During their marriage, she became the highest-paid female star in the world thanks to quirky comedies such as Shampoo, There\u2019s A Girl In My Soup and Private Benjamin. When the pair met in the first-class cabin of a New York to LA flight in 1975, Bill was a successful star in his own right with his group The Hudson Brothers, (\u2018the One Direction of our day,\u2019 he quips). He had his own TV show and performed alongside The Beach Boys, The Osmonds and The Monkees. \n \n \u2018The attraction was instant. I invited her out to dinner that night and that was it. The sex was mind-blowing. Even when everything else in the relationship turned sour, the sex was always amazing.\u2019 \n \n The pair wed in 1976 when Goldie was already pregnant with Oliver. \n \n When their son was born at LA\u2019s Cedars-Sinai hospital, Oliver suffered from the life-threatening condition meconium aspiration, when a newborn accidentally inhales contaminated amniotic fluid. \n \n \u2018Oliver was in isolation for three days,\u2019 says Bill. \u2018Goldie and I were beside ourselves. She was really sick and I\u2019d go from her bedside to the neonatal intensive care unit. The doctors didn\u2019t think Oliver would make it. I was only 26 and in a state of shock. \n \n \u2018Goldie and I were sobbing but Oliver pulled through and from that moment he was our precious miracle. \n \n \u2018He was my first-born. I adored that child. When Kate came along, I loved her with all my heart, too. There was this deep love among the four of us for years. And that\u2019s what makes it so difficult to say goodbye.\u2019 \n \n Actors Oliver Hudson, Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell arrive at amfAR The Foundation for AIDS in 2013 \n \n Bill says clouds formed in the relationship over his wife\u2019s \u2018free spirit\u2019 and desire for an open relationship. \n \n \u2018Goldie was having affairs. She told me pretty much on our wedding night she wanted an open marriage, that she couldn\u2019t imagine being faithful to one man for the rest of her life.\u2019 \n \n When Goldie made a film, Cactus Flower, in London, her mother Laura moved into the marital home \u2013 a magnificent \u00a310 million beachside villa in Malibu \u2013 and helped Bill care for the children. \n \n \u2018Oliver was three and Kate four months old. Goldie went to Europe for a month. I stayed home on Daddy duty. I later found out she\u2019d been sleeping with one of her co-stars, French actor Yves R\u00e9nier. \n \n \u2018I wanted a traditional marriage but Goldie couldn\u2019t settle. Eventually I moved out.\u2019 \n \n The marriage ended in 1981. Bill went on to have a long-term relationship with Love Story actress Ali MacGraw, before marrying Cindy Williams, star of TV comedy Laverne & Shirley. They had two children Emily, now 31, and Zachary, 28, before that marriage also ended in divorce. \n \n Goldie was having affairs. She told me pretty much on our wedding night she wanted an open marriage, that she couldn\u2019t imagine being faithful to one man for the rest of her life \n \n His youngest child is Lalania, nine, from a long-term relationship with a woman to whom he remains \u2018exceptionally close\u2019. \n \n Meanwhile, Goldie met Kurt Russell in 1983. And while the pair have never married, their relationship is considered one of the happiest in Hollywood. \u2018When we first split up, I took a house on the beach in Malibu to stay close to the kids,\u2019 says Bill. \u2018I was a part of their lives for years. Kate and Oliver came over at weekends, there were family holidays. \n \n In fact, the photograph that Oliver posted on Instagram was taken by Cindy while we were on holiday in Florida. Goldie wanted a vacation with Kurt because they\u2019d just got together and so Cindy and I took the kids to DisneyWorld. Everything was cool.\u2019 \n \n But he says Goldie used her increasing fame and financial superiority to \u2018freeze\u2019 him out. \n \n \u2018I call it parental alienation. We had a custody arrangement but Goldie constantly flouted it. I\u2019d turn up to see the kids and would discover Goldie had taken them on the private jet to her home in Colorado. \n \n 'She gave interviews about her \u201cwonderful\u201d relationship with Kurt and how the kids called him \u201cPa\u201d. She described me as an absent father. I\u2019d call her and go \u201cGoldie, how can you say that?\u201d but she\u2019d just reply: \u201cIt\u2019s a better story.\u201d \u2019 \n \n As Kate\u2019s fame grew she, too, accused her father of being an absentee dad: \u2018There was never a birthday card,\u2019 she complained, to which Bill responds: \u2018Rubbish! I sent birthday cards every year. \n \n \u2018I ring her up every birthday, still do. The same with Oliver. I bumped into Oliver fairly recently in a supermarket in Malibu and he gave me a hug. I always thought Oliver could be the peacemaker, that somehow he would help bring our fractured family back together. \n \n Actor Kurt Russell, with Goldie Hawn and her children, actress Kate Hudson and actor Oliver Hudson in 2004 \n \n \u2018Goldie poisoned them against me. She told the kids I\u2019d moved to Portland. I did go to Portland for eight months to make an album but then I came back to LA. I never abandoned my family. I never walked away. I wanted to be a father to Kate and Oliver but Goldie made it harder and harder for me to see them. It\u2019s all about control. What Goldie wants, Goldie gets.\u2019 \n \n He recalled going to mediation during their custody battle. \u2018Goldie grabbed my forearm as we were leaving and said to me: \u201cIt\u2019s all about the money and power, babe.\u201d\u2019 \n \n When Oliver and Kate were in their early teens, Bill decided to end the court battles and told the children his door was always open to them. \u2018Oliver would come and stay with me. We\u2019d go fishing, have sleep-overs. But Kate drifted away.\u2019 \n \n The pair enjoyed an uneasy rapprochement when Kate started dating Black Crowes singer Chris Robinson, father of her elder son Ryder, 11. She also has a three-year-old son Bingham with British rocker Matt Bellamy, from whom she split last year after four years. \n \n \u2018At one point, I was writing a letter to my children every week for a year. Did those letters ever get to them? Who knows? When I read some of the comments on social media, it was so hurtful. People believe the bull****. Well, I\u2019m here to say it\u2019s just not true.\u2019 At first, Bill picks his words carefully over Kate\u2019s Father\u2019s Day photo of herself with Kurt. \u2018It was an intimate shot and, as her father, I found it inappropriate and unsettling. I\u2019ll leave it at that,\u2019 he says. \n \n Goldie Hawn and Bill Hudson at the 1975 Oscars (pictured left) and an undated picture of them (right) \n \n Then, angrily, he adds: \u2018She wants to be Kurt\u2019s daughter? Well then, take his name, stop using mine.\u2019 \n \n He has removed photographs of Kate and Oliver from his home and even thrown away their knitted baby booties \u2018which I carried in the glove compartment of every car I\u2019ve ever owned for good luck\u2019. \n \n Last week, Oliver posted a reply to one fan in which he was unrepentant, emphasising his closeness to Kurt Russell: \u2018What started out as what I thought as a joke has turned into something more. And I embrace that. I\u2019ve done and continue to do a lot of work on myself to better understand what make me tick. Yes, science links us but love binds us. OH + KR = \u2665\u2019 \n \n Bill is clearly still deeply wounded. He says: \u2018Oliver could have picked up the phone and called me but he hasn\u2019t. What shocks me is that this was clearly premeditated. He chose the photograph and posted it on Father\u2019s Day, when he knew it would cause maximum pain. Oliver has lived in the shadow of his mother and sister all his life. Maybe he wanted to be in the headlines? \n \n \u2018If what he wanted was me out of their lives, then he\u2019s succeeded. I don\u2019t want to see either of my eldest children ever again. It\u2019s over.\u2019 ||||| Photo: via Tumblr \n \n Room \n \n \"When legally I didn't have to have visitation with him anymore, I jumped on it,\" Larson said. \"As a kid I tried to understand him and understand the situation.

    "document": "Latter-day Saints believe that the marriage of one man and one woman is the Lord\u2019s standing law of marriage. In biblical times, the Lord commanded some to practice plural marriage\u2014the marriage of one man and more than one woman. 1 By revelation, the Lord commanded Joseph Smith to institute the practice of plural marriage among Church members in the early 1840s. For more than half a century, plural marriage was practiced by some Latter-day Saints under the direction of the Church President. 2 \n \n Latter-day Saints do not understand all of God\u2019s purposes in instituting, through His prophets, the practice of plural marriage. The Book of Mormon identifies one reason for God to command it: to increase the number of children born in the gospel covenant in order to \u201craise up seed unto [the Lord].\u201d3 \n \n Plural marriage did result in the birth of large numbers of children within faithful Latter-day Saint homes. It also shaped 19th-century Mormon society in many ways: marriage became available to virtually all who desired it; per-capita inequality of wealth was diminished as economically disadvantaged women married into more financially stable households; and ethnic intermarriages were increased, which helped to unite a diverse immigrant population. Plural marriage also helped create and strengthen a sense of cohesion and group identification among Latter-day Saints. Church members came to see themselves as a \u201cpeculiar people,\u201d covenant-bound to carry out the commands of God despite outside opposition.4 \n \n The Beginnings of Plural Marriage in the Church \n \n Polygamy had been permitted for millennia in many cultures and religions, but, with few exceptions, it was rejected in Western cultures. In Joseph Smith\u2019s time, monogamy was the only legal form of marriage in the United States. \n \n The revelation on plural marriage, recorded in Doctrine and Covenants 132, emerged partly from Joseph Smith\u2019s study of the Old Testament in 1831. Latter-day Saints understood that they were living in the latter days, in what the revelations called the \u201cdispensation of the fulness of times.\u201d5 Ancient principles\u2014such as prophets, priesthood, and temples\u2014would be restored to the earth. Plural marriage, practiced by ancient patriarchs like Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses, was one of those ancient principles.6 \n \n The same revelation that taught of plural marriage was embedded within a revelation about eternal marriage\u2014the teaching that marriage could last beyond death. Monogamous and plural marriages performed by priesthood power could seal loved ones to each other for eternity, on condition of righteousness.7 \n \n The revelation on marriage stated general principles; it did not explain how to implement plural marriage in all its particulars. In Nauvoo, Joseph Smith married additional wives and authorized other Latter-day Saints to practice plural marriage. The practice was introduced carefully and incrementally, and participants vowed to keep their participation confidential, anticipating a time when husbands and wives could acknowledge one another publicly. \n \n If you would like to learn more about the beginnings of plural marriage in the Church, click here. \n \n Plural Marriage and Families in 19th-Century Utah \n \n Between 1852 and 1890, Latter-day Saints openly practiced plural marriage. Most plural families lived in Utah. Women and men who lived within plural marriage attested to challenges and difficulties but also to the love and joy they found within their families. They believed it was a commandment of God at that time and that obedience would bring great blessings to them and their posterity. Church leaders taught that participants in plural marriages should seek to develop a generous spirit of unselfishness and the pure love of Christ for everyone involved. \n \n Although some leaders had large polygamous families, two-thirds of polygamist men had only two wives at a time. Church leaders recognized that plural marriages could be particularly difficult for women. Divorce was therefore available to women who were unhappy in their marriages; remarriage was also readily available. Women sometimes married at young ages in the first decade of Utah settlement, which was typical of women living in frontier areas at the time. At its peak in 1857, perhaps one half of all Utah Latter-day Saints experienced plural marriage as a husband, wife, or child. The percentage of those involved in plural marriage steadily declined over the next three decades. \n \n During the years that plural marriage was publicly taught, not all Latter-day Saints were expected to live the principle, though all were expected to accept it as a revelation from God. Indeed, this system of marriage could not have been universal due to the ratio of men to women. Women were free to choose their spouses, whether to enter into a polygamous or a monogamous union, or whether to marry at all. Some men entered plural marriage because they were asked to do so by Church leaders, while others initiated the process themselves; all were required to obtain the approval of Church leaders before entering a plural marriage. \n \n If you would like to learn more about plural marriage and families in Utah, click here. \n \n Anti-Polygamy Legislation and the End of Plural Marriage \n \n Beginning in 1862, the U.S. government passed laws against the practice of plural marriage. After the U.S. Supreme Court found the anti-polygamy laws to be constitutional in 1879, federal officials began prosecuting polygamous husbands and wives during the 1880s. Believing these laws to be unjust, Latter-day Saints engaged in civil disobedience by continuing to practice plural marriage and by attempting to avoid arrest by moving to the homes of friends or family or by hiding under assumed names. When convicted, they paid fines and submitted to jail time. \n \n One of the anti-polygamy laws permitted the U.S. government to seize Church property. Federal officers soon threatened to take Latter-day Saint temples. The work of salvation for both the living and the dead was now in jeopardy. In September 1890, Church President Wilford Woodruff felt inspired to issue the Manifesto. \u201cInasmuch as laws have been enacted by Congress forbidding plural marriages,\u201d President Woodruff explained, \u201cI hereby declare my intention to submit to those laws, and to use my influence with the members of the Church over which I preside to have them do likewise.\u201d8 \n \n The full implications of the document were not apparent at first. The Lord\u2019s way is to speak \u201cline upon line; here a little, there a little.\u201d9 Like the beginning of plural marriage in the Church, the end of the practice was gradual and incremental, a process filled with difficulties and uncertainties. \n \n The Manifesto declared President Woodruff\u2019s intention to submit to the laws of the United States, and new plural marriages within that jurisdiction largely came to an end. But a small number of plural marriages continued to be performed in Mexico and Canada, under the sanction of some Church leaders. As a rule, these marriages were not promoted by Church leaders and were difficult to get approved. Either one or both of the spouses who entered into these unions typically had to agree to remain in Canada or Mexico. On an exceptional basis, a smaller number of plural marriages were performed within the United States between the years 1890 and 1904. \n \n The Church\u2019s role in these marriages became a subject of intense public debate after Reed Smoot, an Apostle, was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1903. At the April 1904 general conference, Church President Joseph F. Smith issued a forceful statement, known as the Second Manifesto, making new plural marriages punishable by excommunication.10 Since President Smith\u2019s day, Church Presidents have repeatedly emphasized that the Church and its members are no longer authorized to enter into plural marriage and have underscored the sincerity of their words by urging local leaders to bring noncompliant members before Church disciplinary councils. \n \n If you would like to learn more about the end of plural marriage in the Church, click here. \n \n Conclusion \n \n Plural marriage was among the most challenging aspects of the Restoration. For many who practiced it, plural marriage was a trial of faith. It violated both cultural and legal norms, leading to persecution and revilement. Despite these hardships, plural marriage benefited the Church in innumerable ways. Through the lineage of these 19th-century Saints have come many Latter-day Saints who have been faithful to their gospel covenants as righteous mothers and fathers; loyal disciples of Jesus Christ; devoted Church members, leaders, and missionaries; and good citizens and prominent public officials. Modern Latter-day Saints honor and respect these faithful pioneers who gave so much for their faith, families, and community. \n \n Resources \n \n The Church acknowledges the contribution of scholars to the historical content presented in this article; their work is used with permission. \n \n Originally published October 2014. ||||| After receiving a revelation commanding him to practice plural marriage, Joseph Smith married multiple wives and introduced the practice to close associates. This principle was among the most challenging aspects of the Restoration\u2014for Joseph personally and for other Church members. Plural marriage tested faith and provoked controversy and opposition. Few Latter-day Saints initially welcomed the restoration of a biblical practice entirely foreign to their sensibilities. But many later testified of powerful spiritual experiences that helped them overcome their hesitation and gave them courage to accept this practice. \n \n Latter-day Saints believe that monogamy\u2014the marriage of one man and one woman\u2014is the Lord\u2019s standing law of marriage. 1 In biblical times, the Lord commanded some of His people to practice plural marriage\u2014the marriage of one man and more than one woman. 2 Some early members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints also received and obeyed this commandment given through God\u2019s prophets. \n \n Although the Lord commanded the adoption\u2014and later the cessation\u2014of plural marriage in the latter days, He did not give exact instructions on how to obey the commandment. Significant social and cultural changes often include misunderstandings and difficulties. Church leaders and members experienced these challenges as they heeded the command to practice plural marriage and again later as they worked to discontinue it after Church President Wilford Woodruff issued an inspired statement known as the Manifesto in 1890, which led to the end of plural marriage in the Church. Through it all, Church leaders and members sought to follow God\u2019s will. \n \n Many details about the early practice of plural marriage are unknown. Plural marriage was introduced among the early Saints incrementally, and participants were asked to keep their actions confidential. They did not discuss their experiences publicly or in writing until after the Latter-day Saints had moved to Utah and Church leaders had publicly acknowledged the practice. The historical record of early plural marriage is therefore thin: few records of the time provide details, and later reminiscences are not always reliable. Some ambiguity will always accompany our knowledge about this issue. Like the participants, we \u201csee through a glass, darkly\u201d and are asked to walk by faith.3 \n \n The Beginnings of Plural Marriage in the Church \n \n The revelation on plural marriage was not written down until 1843, but its early verses suggest that part of it emerged from Joseph Smith\u2019s study of the Old Testament in 1831. People who knew Joseph well later stated he received the revelation about that time.4 The revelation, recorded in Doctrine and Covenants 132, states that Joseph prayed to know why God justified Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, and Solomon in having many wives. The Lord responded that He had commanded them to enter into the practice.5 \n \n Latter-day Saints understood that they were living in the latter days, in what the revelations called the \u201cdispensation of the fulness of times.\u201d6 Ancient principles\u2014such as prophets, priesthood, and temples\u2014would be restored to the earth. Plural marriage was one of those ancient principles. \n \n Polygamy had been permitted for millennia in many cultures and religions, but, with few exceptions, was rejected in Western cultures.7 In Joseph Smith\u2019s time, monogamy was the only legal form of marriage in the United States. Joseph knew the practice of plural marriage would stir up public ire. After receiving the commandment, he taught a few associates about it, but he did not spread this teaching widely in the 1830s.8 \n \n When God commands a difficult task, He sometimes sends additional messengers to encourage His people to obey. Consistent with this pattern, Joseph told associates that an angel appeared to him three times between 1834 and 1842 and commanded him to proceed with plural marriage when he hesitated to move forward. During the third and final appearance, the angel came with a drawn sword, threatening Joseph with destruction unless he went forward and obeyed the commandment fully.9 \n \n Fragmentary evidence suggests that Joseph Smith acted on the angel\u2019s first command by marrying a plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio, in the mid-1830s. Several Latter-day Saints who had lived in Kirtland reported decades later that Joseph Smith had married Alger, who lived and worked in the Smith household, after he had obtained her consent and that of her parents.10 Little is known about this marriage, and nothing is known about the conversations between Joseph and Emma regarding Alger. After the marriage with Alger ended in separation, Joseph seems to have set the subject of plural marriage aside until after the Church moved to Nauvoo, Illinois. \n \n Plural Marriage and Eternal Marriage \n \n The same revelation that taught of plural marriage was part of a larger revelation given to Joseph Smith\u2014that marriage could last beyond death and that eternal marriage was essential to inheriting the fulness that God desires for His children. As early as 1840, Joseph Smith privately taught Apostle Parley P. Pratt that the \u201cheavenly order\u201d allowed Pratt and his wife to be together \u201cfor time and all eternity.\u201d11 Joseph also taught that men like Pratt\u2014who had remarried following the death of his first wife\u2014could be married (or sealed) to their wives for eternity, under the proper conditions.12 \n \n The sealing of husband and wife for eternity was made possible by the restoration of priesthood keys and ordinances. On April 3, 1836, the Old Testament prophet Elijah appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery in the Kirtland Temple and restored the priesthood keys necessary to perform ordinances for the living and the dead, including sealing families together.13 Marriages performed by priesthood authority could link loved ones to each other for eternity, on condition of righteousness; marriages performed without this authority would end at death.14 \n \n Marriage performed by priesthood authority meant that the procreation of children and perpetuation of families would continue into the eternities. Joseph Smith\u2019s revelation on marriage declared that the \u201ccontinuation of the seeds forever and ever\u201d helped to fulfill God\u2019s purposes for His children.15 This promise was given to all couples who were married by priesthood authority and were faithful to their covenants. \n \n Plural Marriage in Nauvoo \n \n For much of Western history, family \u201cinterest\u201d\u2014economic, political, and social considerations\u2014dominated the choice of spouse. Parents had the power to arrange marriages or forestall unions of which they disapproved. By the late 1700s, romance and personal choice began to rival these traditional motives and practices.16 By Joseph Smith\u2019s time, many couples insisted on marrying for love, as he and Emma did when they eloped against her parents\u2019 wishes. \n \n Latter-day Saints\u2019 motives for plural marriage were often more religious than economic or romantic. Besides the desire to be obedient, a strong incentive was the hope of living in God\u2019s presence with family members. In the revelation on marriage, the Lord promised participants \u201ccrowns of eternal lives\u201d and \u201cexaltation in the eternal worlds.\u201d17 Men and women, parents and children, ancestors and progeny were to be \u201csealed\u201d to each other\u2014their commitment lasting into the eternities, consistent with Jesus\u2019s promise that priesthood ordinances performed on earth could be \u201cbound in heaven.\u201d18 \n \n The first plural marriage in Nauvoo took place when Louisa Beaman and Joseph Smith were sealed in April 1841.19 Joseph married many additional wives and authorized other Latter-day Saints to practice plural marriage. The practice spread slowly at first. By June 1844, when Joseph died, approximately 29 men and 50 women had entered into plural marriage, in addition to Joseph and his wives. When the Saints entered the Salt Lake Valley in 1847, at least 196 men and 521 women had entered into plural marriages.20 Participants in these early plural marriages pledged to keep their involvement confidential, though they anticipated a time when the practice would be publicly acknowledged. \n \n Nevertheless, rumors spread. A few men unscrupulously used these rumors to seduce women to join them in an unauthorized practice sometimes referred to as \u201cspiritual wifery.\u201d When this was discovered, the men were cut off from the Church.21 The rumors prompted members and leaders to issue carefully worded denials that denounced spiritual wifery and polygamy but were silent about what Joseph Smith and others saw as divinely mandated \u201ccelestial\u201d plural marriage.22 The statements emphasized that the Church practiced no marital law other than monogamy while implicitly leaving open the possibility that individuals, under direction of God\u2019s living prophet, might do so.23 \n \n Joseph Smith and Plural Marriage \n \n During the era in which plural marriage was practiced, Latter-day Saints distinguished between sealings for time and eternity and sealings for eternity only. Sealings for time and eternity included commitments and relationships during this life, generally including the possibility of sexual relations. Eternity-only sealings indicated relationships in the next life alone. \n \n Evidence indicates that Joseph Smith participated in both types of sealings. The exact number of women to whom he was sealed in his lifetime is unknown because the evidence is fragmentary.24 Some of the women who were sealed to Joseph Smith later testified that their marriages were for time and eternity, while others indicated that their relationships were for eternity alone.25 \n \n Most of those sealed to Joseph Smith were between 20 and 40 years of age at the time of their sealing to him. The oldest, Fanny Young, was 56 years old. The youngest was Helen Mar Kimball, daughter of Joseph\u2019s close friends Heber C. and Vilate Murray Kimball, who was sealed to Joseph several months before her 15th birthday. Marriage at such an age, inappropriate by today\u2019s standards, was legal in that era, and some women married in their mid-teens.26 Helen Mar Kimball spoke of her sealing to Joseph as being \u201cfor eternity alone,\u201d suggesting that the relationship did not involve sexual relations.27 After Joseph\u2019s death, Helen remarried and became an articulate defender of him and of plural marriage.28 \n \n Following his marriage to Louisa Beaman and before he married other single women, Joseph Smith was sealed to a number of women who were already married.29 Neither these women nor Joseph explained much about these sealings, though several women said they were for eternity alone.30 Other women left no records, making it unknown whether their sealings were for time and eternity or were for eternity alone. \n \n There are several possible explanations for this practice. These sealings may have provided a way to create an eternal bond or link between Joseph\u2019s family and other families within the Church.31 These ties extended both vertically, from parent to child, and horizontally, from one family to another. Today such eternal bonds are achieved through the temple marriages of individuals who are also sealed to their own birth families, in this way linking families together. Joseph Smith\u2019s sealings to women already married may have been an early version of linking one family to another. In Nauvoo, most if not all of the first husbands seem to have continued living in the same household with their wives during Joseph\u2019s lifetime, and complaints about these sealings with Joseph Smith are virtually absent from the documentary record.32 \n \n These sealings may also be explained by Joseph\u2019s reluctance to enter plural marriage because of the sorrow it would bring to his wife Emma. He may have believed that sealings to married women would comply with the Lord\u2019s command without requiring him to have normal marriage relationships.33 This could explain why, according to Lorenzo Snow, the angel reprimanded Joseph for having \u201cdemurred\u201d on plural marriage even after he had entered into the practice.34 After this rebuke, according to this interpretation, Joseph returned primarily to sealings with single women. \n \n Another possibility is that, in an era when life spans were shorter than they are today, faithful women felt an urgency to be sealed by priesthood authority. Several of these women were married either to non-Mormons or former Mormons, and more than one of the women later expressed unhappiness in their present marriages. Living in a time when divorce was difficult to obtain, these women may have believed a sealing to Joseph Smith would give them blessings they might not otherwise receive in the next life.35 \n \n The women who united with Joseph Smith in plural marriage risked reputation and self-respect in being associated with a principle so foreign to their culture and so easily misunderstood by others. \u201cI made a greater sacrifice than to give my life,\u201d said Zina Huntington Jacobs, \u201cfor I never anticipated again to be looked upon as an honorable woman.\u201d Nevertheless, she wrote, \u201cI searched the scripture & by humble prayer to my Heavenly Father I obtained a testimony for myself.\u201d36 After Joseph\u2019s death, most of the women sealed to him moved to Utah with the Saints, remained faithful Church members, and defended both plural marriage and Joseph.37 \n \n Joseph and Emma \n \n Plural marriage was difficult for all involved. For Joseph Smith\u2019s wife Emma, it was an excruciating ordeal. Records of Emma\u2019s reactions to plural marriage are sparse; she left no firsthand accounts, making it impossible to reconstruct her thoughts. Joseph and Emma loved and respected each other deeply. After he had entered into plural marriage, he poured out his feelings in his journal for his \u201cbeloved Emma,\u201d whom he described as \u201cundaunted, firm and unwavering, unchangeable, affectionate Emma.\u201d After Joseph\u2019s death, Emma kept a lock of his hair in a locket she wore around her neck.38 \n \n Emma approved, at least for a time, of four of Joseph Smith\u2019s plural marriages in Nauvoo, and she accepted all four of those wives into her household. She may have approved of other marriages as well.39 But Emma likely did not know about all of Joseph\u2019s sealings.40 She vacillated in her view of plural marriage, at some points supporting it and at other times denouncing it. \n \n In the summer of 1843, Joseph Smith dictated the revelation on marriage, a lengthy and complex text containing both glorious promises and stern warnings, some directed at Emma.41 The revelation instructed women and men that they must obey God\u2019s law and commands in order to receive the fulness of His glory. \n \n The revelation on marriage required that a wife give her consent before her husband could enter into plural marriage.42 Nevertheless, toward the end of the revelation, the Lord said that if the first wife \u201creceive not this law\u201d\u2014the command to practice plural marriage\u2014the husband would be \u201cexempt from the law of Sarah,\u201d presumably the requirement that the husband gain the consent of the first wife before marrying additional women.43 After Emma opposed plural marriage, Joseph was placed in an agonizing dilemma, forced to choose between the will of God and the will of his beloved Emma. He may have thought Emma\u2019s rejection of plural marriage exempted him from the law of Sarah. Her decision to \u201creceive not this law\u201d permitted him to marry additional wives without her consent. Because of Joseph\u2019s early death and Emma\u2019s decision to remain in Nauvoo and not discuss plural marriage after the Church moved west, many aspects of their story remain known only to the two of them. \n \n Trial and Spiritual Witness \n \n Years later in Utah, participants in Nauvoo plural marriage discussed their motives for entering into the practice. God declared in the Book of Mormon that monogamy was the standard; at times, however, He commanded plural marriage so His people could \u201craise up seed unto [Him].\u201d44 Plural marriage did result in an increased number of children born to believing parents.45 \n \n Some Saints also saw plural marriage as a redemptive process of sacrifice and spiritual refinement. According to Helen Mar Kimball, Joseph Smith stated that \u201cthe practice of this principle would be the hardest trial the Saints would ever have to test their faith.\u201d Though it was one of the \u201cseverest\u201d trials of her life, she testified that it had also been \u201cone of the greatest blessings.\u201d46 Her father, Heber C. Kimball, agreed. \u201cI never felt more sorrowful,\u201d he said of the moment he learned of plural marriage in 1841. \u201cI wept days. \u2026 I had a good wife. I was satisfied.\u201d47 \n \n The decision to accept such a wrenching trial usually came only after earnest prayer and intense soul-searching. Brigham Young said that, upon learning of plural marriage, \u201cit was the first time in my life that I had desired the grave.\u201d48 \u201cI had to pray unceasingly,\u201d he said, \u201cand I had to exercise faith and the Lord revealed to me the truth of it and that satisfied me.\u201d49 Heber C. Kimball found comfort only after his wife Vilate had a visionary experience attesting to the rightness of plural marriage. \u201cShe told me,\u201d Vilate\u2019s daughter later recalled, \u201cshe never saw so happy a man as father was when she described the vision and told him she was satisfied and knew it was from God.\u201d50 \n \n Lucy Walker recalled her inner turmoil when Joseph Smith invited her to become his wife. \u201cEvery feeling of my soul revolted against it,\u201d she wrote. Yet, after several restless nights on her knees in prayer, she found relief as her room \u201cfilled with a holy influence\u201d akin to \u201cbrilliant sunshine.\u201d She said, \u201cMy soul was filled with a calm sweet peace that I never knew,\u201d and \u201csupreme happiness took possession of my whole being.\u201d51 \n \n Not all had such experiences. Some Latter-day Saints rejected the principle of plural marriage and left the Church, while others declined to enter the practice but remained faithful.52 Nevertheless, for many women and men, initial revulsion and anguish was followed by struggle, resolution, and ultimately, light and peace. Sacred experiences enabled the Saints to move forward in faith.53 \n \n Conclusion \n \n The challenge of introducing a principle as controversial as plural marriage is almost impossible to overstate. A spiritual witness of its truthfulness allowed Joseph Smith and other Latter-day Saints to accept this principle. Difficult as it was, the introduction of plural marriage in Nauvoo did indeed \u201craise up seed\u201d unto God. A substantial number of today\u2019s members descend through faithful Latter-day Saints who practiced plural marriage. \n \n Church members no longer practice plural marriage.54 Consistent with Joseph Smith\u2019s teachings, the Church permits a man whose wife has died to be sealed to another woman when he remarries. Moreover, members are permitted to perform ordinances on behalf of deceased men and women who married more than once on earth, sealing them to all of the spouses to whom they were legally married. The precise nature of these relationships in the next life is not known, and many family relationships will be sorted out in the life to come. Latter-day Saints are encouraged to trust in our wise Heavenly Father, who loves His children and does all things for their growth and salvation.55 \n \n Resources \n \n The Church acknowledges the contribution of scholars to the historical content presented in this article; their work is used with permission. \n \n Originally published October 2014.",
    "summary": "\u2013 The Mormon church's big revelations didn't stop with its sacred undergarments: In an online essay titled \"Plural Marriage in Kirtland and Nauvoo,\" the church for the first time declares that founder Joseph Smith was a polygamist, with a footnote stating that \"careful estimates\" put his tally of wives at between 30 and 40. The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\"). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home. And what was the reasoning behind what the essay describes as the \"wrenching trial\" of polygamy? Kimball said Smith told her that \"the practice of this principle would be the hardest trial the Saints would ever have to test their faith.\" Two more essays discuss plural marriage in the church's later years; they're part of an effort the church is making to share \"reliable, faith-promoting\" info about its past, the church's historian tells the Times.

Truman. \n \n Truman lost a total of 83 House seats during his two midterms (55 seats in 1946 and 28 seats in 1950), while Republican Dwight Eisenhower lost a combined 66 House seats in the 1954 and 1958 midterms. \n \n Obama had one midterm where his party lost 63 House seats, and Democrats are expected to lose another 5 to possibly 12 House seats (or more), taking the sitting president\u2019s total midterm House loses to the 68 seat to 75 seat range. \n \n (Join us on Election Night: Live Stream With Analysis, Results and More at RollCall.com) \n \n Most recent presidents have one disastrous midterm and another midterm that was not terrible. \n \n The GOP lost 30 House seats in George W. Bush\u2019s second midterm, but gained 8 seats in his first midterm for a net loss of 22 seats. The party lost 26 seats in Ronald Reagan\u2019s first midterm, but a mere 5 seats in his second midterm for a net loss of 31 seats. \n \n Democrats got shellacked in 1994, losing 54 seats in Bill Clinton\u2019s first midterm, but the party gained 5 House seats in 1998, Clinton\u2019s six-year-itch election, for a net Clinton loss of 49 House seats. (The figures don\u2019t include special elections during a president\u2019s term.) \n \n Looking at Senate losses, Republicans lost a net of 5 seats in George W. Bush\u2019s two midterms, while Republicans lost a net of 7 seats during Ronald Reagan\u2019s two midterms and Democrats lost a net of 8 seats during Bill Clinton\u2019s two midterms. (Again, these numbers do not reflect party switches or special elections.) \n \n Democrats have a chance to tie the number of Senate losses that Republicans suffered during the midterms of Eisenhower, when the GOP lost a net of 13 Senate seats (12 in 1958 and only one in 1954). \n \n Democrats lost 6 Senate seats in 2010 and seem likely to lose from 5 to as many as 10 seats next week. That would add up to Obama midterm Senate losses of from 11 seats to as many as 16 seats. \n \n Democrats will likely not exceed the number of Senate losses they incurred during the two Truman midterms, in 1946 and 1950, when the party lost a remarkable net of 17 seats. \n \n (Interactive: How Much Is Your Member of Congress Worth?) \n \n Are the Democrats\u2019 losses due to the increasingly partisan nature of our elections and the makeup of the past two Senate classes, or is the president at least partially to blame because he failed to show leadership on key issues and never successfully moved to the political center? \n \n The answer, most obviously, is, \u201cYes.\u201d \n \n Correction, 10:15 a.m. A previous version of this story misstated the year in which the Democrats lost 6 Senate seats during President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure. \n \n Related: \n \n A Nerve-Wracking Finish for Democrats \n \n Democrats Run From Harry Reid \n \n McConnell: Obamacare Repeal Will Take 60 Votes (Updated) \n \n Democrats Losing Youth Vote: Millennials Turning to the GOP \n \n Roll Call Election Map: Race Ratings for Every Seat \n \n Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call in your inbox or on your iPhone. ||||| Senate Democrats have long awaited the 2010 tea party wave to splash back on Republicans during the 2016 election cycle. \n \n That moment is almost here. \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset \n \n After two years of obsessive focus on the teetering reelection prospects of red-state Democrats, the attention is about to shift in a major way to blue-state Republicans. Six of them who rode anti-Obama sentiment to office in 2010 are up in two years, and they\u2019ll face the dual challenge of a more diverse electorate and potentially Hillary Clinton atop the Democratic ticket. \n \n The leftward-tilting map means a GOP-controlled Senate could be short-lived if the party prevails on Tuesday. Even in the best-case scenario for the party, a Republican majority is certain to be slim. \n \n (POLITICO's 2014 race ratings) \n \n A half-dozen first-term Republicans are up for reelection in states President Barack Obama won in both 2008 and 2012: Mark Kirk of Illinois, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Rob Portman of Ohio, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Marco Rubio of Florida. Obama also twice carried Sen. Chuck Grassley\u2019s Iowa, but the longtime incumbent would be much tougher to dislodge. \n \n Add it all up and it\u2019s basically the mirror image of 2014. \n \n \u201cWe shift the ground from where it was this time \u2014 seven Democrats were running in states that Obama didn\u2019t carry \u2014 to an environment where seven Republicans are running in states that Obama did carry,\u201d said Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, a member of GOP leadership up for reelection in 2016. \n \n Republicans are trying to look at the bright side of the intimidating terrain. If the GOP proves itself a responsible steward of Congress over the next two years, Republicans believe voters will be less inclined to oust vulnerable GOP incumbents. \n \n (WATCH: Driving the Election Day: Colorado) \n \n \u201cIf there\u2019s an advantage to Republicans in the 2016 campaign \u2026 it\u2019s the chance that you had to finally make the case,\u201d said Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran, the current National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman. \n \n Democrats are also eyeing incumbents in states that Obama won in 2008 but lost four years later: Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana and Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, both of whom have under $800,000 on hand. Meanwhile, potential primary challenges could loom for Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2014 plus Blunt, Moran and South Dakota Sen. John Thune, a GOP leader, depending on the mood of conservative insurgents. \n \n With House Republicans expected to pad their majority this November and possibly put the chamber out of reach in 2016, the battle for the Senate is expected to be the main undercard to the presidential election.

The biggest potential trophy is Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who is up for reelection in Nevada. One formidable potential challenger is Gov.

He can again, [but] he\u2019ll be the underdog.\u201d \n \n Names of several potential challengers are already being floated, according to party insiders. Democratic state Attorney General Lisa Madigan has been mentioned as a candidate in Illinois. Former Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) could opt for a rematch against Johnson. And two names have surfaced in Pennsylvania: Attorney General Kathleen Kane and former Rep. Joe Sestak (D), who\u2019s raising money for a rematch of his 2010 loss. \n \n Toomey\u2019s war chest sits at $5.4 million in cash at the end of September, Kirk has $1.5 million and Johnson has $669,000. Each spent more than $14 million in 2010, according to OpenSecrets. \n \n \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be caught by surprise,\u201d said Kevin Madden, a former top campaign hand for Mitt Romney. \u201cThose are folks that were counted as underdogs when they won.\u201d",
    "summary": "\u2013 Most of the national attention in Tuesday's election is focused on GOP gains in the Senate, but Roll Call points out that Republicans also are poised to hand President Obama a milestone he'd rather avoid in the House. Consider that Democrats lost 63 seats in the 2010 midterms are expected to lose five to 12 (or maybe more) seats on Tuesday. No president has lost as many in back-to-back midterms since Harry Truman lost 83 in 1946 and 1950, writes Stuart Rothenberg. Dwight Eisenhower managed to lose a total of 66, but Obama seems on track to top him. More typical is the pattern of Bill Clinton, who lost 54 in 1994 but bounced back with a gain of five in 1998. Still, if Tuesday is shaping up to be a night of celebration for the GOP, Politico offers a reality check, at least in the Senate: Several first-term Republicans in vulnerable states will be up for re-election in 2016.

    "document": "Abstract \n \n To discover interordinal relationships of living and fossil placental mammals and the time of origin of placentals relative to the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary, we scored 4541 phenomic characters de novo for 86 fossil and living species. Combining these data with molecular sequences, we obtained a phylogenetic tree that, when calibrated with fossils, shows that crown clade Placentalia and placental orders originated after the K-Pg boundary. Many nodes discovered using molecular data are upheld, but phenomic signals overturn molecular signals to show Sundatheria (Dermoptera + Scandentia) as the sister taxon of Primates, a close link between Proboscidea (elephants) and Sirenia (sea cows), and the monophyly of echolocating Chiroptera (bats). Our tree suggests that Placentalia first split into Xenarthra and Epitheria; extinct New World species are the oldest members of Afrotheria. ||||| Humankind\u2019s common ancestor with other mammals may have been a roughly rat-size animal that weighed no more than a half a pound, had a long furry tail and lived on insects. \n \n In a comprehensive six-year study of the mammalian family tree, scientists have identified and reconstructed what they say is the most likely common ancestor of the many species on the most abundant and diverse branch of that tree \u2014 the branch of creatures that nourish their young in utero through a placenta. The work appears to support the view that in the global extinctions some 66 million years ago, all non-avian dinosaurs had to die for mammals to flourish. \n \n Scientists had been searching for just such a common genealogical link and have found it in a lowly occupant of the fossil record, Protungulatum donnae, that until now has been so obscure that it lacks a colloquial nickname. But as researchers reported Thursday in the journal Science, the animal had several anatomical characteristics for live births that anticipated all placental mammals and led to some 5,400 living species, from shrews to elephants, bats to whales, cats to dogs and, not least, humans. \n \n A team of researchers described the discovery as an important insight into the pattern and timing of early mammal life and a demonstration of the capabilities of a new system for handling copious amounts of fossil and genetic data in the service of evolutionary biology. The formidable new technology is expected to be widely applied in years ahead to similar investigations of plants, insects, fish and fowl. \n \n Given some belated stature by an artist\u2019s brush, the animal hardly looks the part of a progenitor of so many mammals (which do not include marsupials, like kangaroos and opossums, or monotremes, egg-laying mammals like the duck-billed platypus). \n \n Maureen A. O\u2019Leary of Stony Brook University on Long Island, a leader of the project and the principal author of the journal report, wrote that a combination of genetic and anatomical data established that the ancestor emerged within 200,000 to 400,000 years after the great dying at the end of the Cretaceous period. At the time, the meek were rapidly inheriting the earth from hulking predators like T. rex. \n \n Within another two million to three million years, Dr. O\u2019Leary said, the first members of modern placental orders appeared in such profusion that researchers have started to refer to the explosive model of mammalian evolution. The common ancestor itself appeared more than 36 million years later than had been estimated based on genetic data alone. \n \n Although some small primitive mammals had lived in the shadow of the great Cretaceous reptiles, the scientists could not find evidence supporting an earlier hypothesis that up to 39 placental mammalian lineages survived to enter the post-extinction world. Only the stem lineage to Placentalia, they said, appeared to hang on through the catastrophe, generally associated with climate change after an asteroid crashed into Earth. \n \n The research team drew on combined fossil evidence and genetic data encoded in DNA in evaluating the ancestor\u2019s standing as an early placental mammal. Among characteristics associated with full-term live births, the Protungulatum species was found to have a two-horned uterus and a placenta in which the maternal blood came in close contact with the membranes surrounding the fetus, as in humans. \n \n The ancestor\u2019s younger age, the scientists said, ruled out the breakup of the supercontinent of Gondwana around 120 million years ago as a direct factor in the diversification of mammals, as has sometimes been speculated. Evidence of the common ancestor was found in North America, but the animal may have existed on other continents as well. \n \n The publicly accessible database responsible for the findings is called MorphoBank, with advanced software for handling the largest compilation yet of data and images on mammals living and extinct. \u201cThis has stretched our own expertise,\u201d Dr. O\u2019Leary, an anatomist, said in an interview. \n \n \u201cThe findings were not a total surprise,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s an important discovery because it relies on lots of information from fossils and also molecular data. Other scientists, at least a thousand, some from other countries, are already signing up to use MorphoBank.\u201d ||||| What's cute and furry and has a name only a paleontologist could love? \n \n A tiny theoretical creature dubbed the \"hypothetical placental mammal ancestor\" is stealing the hearts of some evolutionary biologists \u2014 and annoying others \u2014 as it raises new debate over just when our early mammal ancestors began diversifying across the globe. \n \n In a paper published this week in the journal Science, an international team of researchers described how they used a vast database of fossil and anatomical data, as well as DNA evidence, to reverse-engineer an ancestor to the largest group of living mammals. \n \n The scientists theorized that this hypothetical critter would have begun to diversify into new species of mammals after the demise of the dinosaurs roughly 66 million years ago \u2014 a concept at odds with some current thinking. \n \n \"This is fairly novel, to reconstruct an ancestor,\" said study coauthor and paleontologist Mike Novacek, the provost of science at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. \"I don't know of any other.\" \n \n Placental mammals, including humans, make up the largest branch of the mammalian family tree. Only marsupials and a small number of egg-laying mammals are excluded. \n \n For the last several decades, scientists have debated just when it was that placental mammals began their explosive proliferation. Estimates based on DNA, or so-called molecular evidence, suggest that placental mammals appeared in the mid-Cretaceous period when dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex and Triceratops still trod the Earth. \n \n However, scientists have yet to uncover evidence of placental fossils during this period, according to the authors of the new study. They argue that this is because placental mammals began to diversify only several hundred thousand years after the demise of non-avian dinosaurs, in the Paleocene epoch. \n \n \"An environment that radically changed may have offered more opportunities for a new group to take form and radiate,\" Novacek said. \n \n Using a vast online database called Morphobank, the team of 23 scientists built a composite of the hypothetical ancestor based on the morphology, or appearance, of existing and extinct animals, along with the DNA data. Study coauthor Maureen O'Leary, a paleontologist at Stony Brook University in New York, likened the process to reassembling a crime scene from thousands of bits of evidence. \n \n Over a period of six years, the researchers developed a highly specific picture of an unassuming little animal whose descendants would one day include whales, bats, lions and people. \n \n \"The placental ancestor was a scampering species that had a diet of insects, a fleshy nose, a light underbelly in its fur, and a long tail,\" O'Leary said. \"It was larger than a mouse, but smaller than a rat.\" \n \n Based on their findings, the scientists said placental mammals began their spread about 36 million years later than estimates based on the DNA-derived molecular clock model. \n \n The research team also contradicted the molecular clock-based theory that placental mammals developed into different species because of the fragmentation of the supercontinent Gondwana, millions of years before the dinosaurs vanished. In addition, the study concluded that a subset of placental mammals known as Afrotheria, which includes elephants and aardvarks, did not originate in Africa as commonly believed; instead, authors say they arose in the Americas. \n \n Not all evolutionary biologists have fallen in love with the furry, hypothetical bug eater, however. Argument over the rise of placental mammals is likely to continue for some time. \n \n \"The bottom line is that this study is not convincing and will not settle the debate,\" said Mark Springer, an evolutionary geneticist at UC Riverside who was not part of the research team. \n \n Using fossils to establish branches of a family tree can result in mistaken groupings of species, Springer said, because some traits are passed along by related species while other traits develop in parallel with more distantly related species. This is known as convergent evolution, and Springer said he was not convinced that study authors had addressed that issue. \n \n Study coauthor Novacek said he did not expect the paper to end discussion on the matter, but he hoped it would add weight to an ongoing argument. \n \n \"I think this will reinforce the notion that the fossil record is not in agreement with what's been reconstructed by molecular clocks,\" Novacek said. \"As data accumulates, the case for this late origin becomes better and better.\" \n \n Another debate is brewing over whether the hypothetical creature deserves a less cumbersome moniker. \n \n \"People who think this organism is cute have asked me for a name,\" Novacek said. \"I tell them we can't give it a Latin name, because it never really existed.\" \n \n monte.morin@latimes.com",

    "document": "In a rapid series of progressively escalating press releases by the Illinois Department of Public Health, it appears that a dangerous synthetic cannabinoid product called K2, spice, synthetic marijuana, legal weed or fake weed has now claimed its latest victim in an outbreak currently totaling 38 people whose severe bleeding is linked to exposure of this substance. The state division just announced the first death in this cluster. Over recent days, the toll of those harmed continues to increase with all being hospitalized for spontaneous excessive bleeding, including but not limited to coughing up blood, urinating blood, bloody stools, bleeding from the eyes, ears, nose and gums. \n \n Illinois government officials warn that these items were sold by convenience stores and dealers or obtained from friends. They have issued this advisory: \n \n \u201cIf you have purchased any of this product in the past month, do not use it. If you have used any of these products, and start experiencing severe, unexplained bleeding or bruising, please have someone take you to the hospital immediately or call 911. Do not walk or drive yourself. Tell your health care providers about the possible link between your symptoms and synthetic cannabinoid use.\u201d \n \n What are synthetic cannabinoids? \n \n The agency goes on to inform about the varying misperceptions people have with respect to synthetic cannabinoids and their falsely perceived safety. As per their description, they are human-made, unregulated mind-altering chemicals that fall under a drug category called new psychoactive substances (NPS). These substances are sprayed on dried plant material for smoking or sold in liquid form to be used in vaporizing devices. \n \n They are sold and used recreationally under many names (e.g. herbal or liquid incense, K2, Spice, Black Mamba, Bombay Blue, Genie, Zohai, among others). Often pitched as being able to mimic the effects of cannabis because the chemical makeup is similar to those in the marijuana plant, the marketing of synthetic cannabinoids as synthetic \u201cpot\u201d can be deceptive and untrue. Synthetic cannabinoids have been found to impact the brain with greater potency, be volatile and life-threatening. \n \n What is causing the internal bleeding (and now death) in Illinois? \n \n According to the Chicago Tribune, \n \n \u201cConsumption of synthetic cannabinoids previously has caused serious health problems such as seizures and kidney failure, but the side effect of severe bleeding is tied to the recent outbreak, said Dr. Patrick Lank, a medical toxicologist who works at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.\u201d The article goes on to reveal \u201cthree of the hospitalized people tested positive for brodifacoum, more commonly known as rat poison.\u201d \n \n You may be familiar with the drug coumadin - a blood thinning medication used to treat clots and prevent stroke - whose generic name is warfarin. Brodifacoum is often called a \u201csuperwarfarin\u201d because it is extremely powerful with a long duration of action. \n \n Rat poison notoriously contains ingredients that have anticoagulant properties - or substances that impede someone\u2019s ability to clot effectively. This particular compound antagonizes Vitamin K (which is necessary for proper clotting) and has an especially long half-life, so treatment for poisonings requires high doses at regular, continuous intervals for protracted periods of time. Over-the-counter options are not good enough given the severity of the problem and the urgency needed to correct it. And, therapies are mostly helpful when initiated before extensive bleeding and blood loss takes place. \n \n Once someone loses their ability to clot a cascade of untoward events follows. With such internal bleeding and blood loss, a person can go into shock, suffer a stroke, cardiac events, loss of consciousness and death. \n \n The bottom line\u2026 \n \n Efforts to liken synthetic cannabinoids to the active ingredient in marijuana by calling the products synthetic \u201cpot\u201d or \u201cmarijuana\u201d are misleading misnomers. These \u201cproducts\u201d contain many highly potent, dangerous chemicals and you are taking big risks when using them. \n \n ADDENDUM (4/2/18, 8pm) \n \n The Illinois Department of Public Health now reports 2 deaths, 56 cases and expects these numbers to rise. See their link here for daily updates on this outbreak. ||||| A woman from central Illinois has become the fourth person in the state to die from synthetic marijuana, officials announced Tuesday. \n \n The woman, whose name was not disclosed, was in her 30s, the Illinois Department of Public Health reported. \n \n Previously, two men, one in his 20s and another in his 40s, died in central Illinois, along with a Chicago-area man in his 20s. \n \n Health officials reported that 153 people in 13 counties in Illinois have gotten sick from synthetic cannabinoids believed to be laced with rat poison. Most victims are from the Chicago and Peoria areas. \n \n Synthetic marijuana is not marijuana at all but man-made chemicals sold on the premise that they act on the same brain cell receptors as the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, THC. \n \n In recent weeks, victims have begun showing up in hospital emergency rooms after coughing up blood, bleeding in the urine, nose or gums, or having internal bleeding, officials said. It was determined that they were suffering from a chemical found in rat poison called brodifacoum, which prevents blood from clotting. Officials said the poison is believed to have been mixed in with the synthetic marijuana. \n \n Patients are treated with intravenous transfusions of vitamin K to restore their blood\u2019s clotting ability, followed by vitamin K pills. On Monday, officials announced a donation of nearly 800,000 vitamin K tablets by the Bausch Foundation, a philanthropic arm of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. in Laval, Quebec. \n \n rmccoppin@chicagotribune.com \n \n Twitter @RobertMcCoppin \n \n RELATED \n \n Illinois gets donation of nearly 800,000 vitamin K tablets to treat poisoning from synthetic marijuana \u00bb \n \n 71-year-old central Illinois woman charged in synthetic marijuana case \u00bb \n \n Tainted synthetic pot eyed as cause of another Illinois death as store owner accused of selling substance held without bail \u00bb ||||| (CNN) A fourth death in central Illinois has been connected to synthetic cannabinoid use, the Illinois Department of Public Health reported Tuesday. \n \n Since March 7, synthetic cannabinoids have sickened 153 people and been blamed in four deaths: a woman in her 30s, a man in his 40s and two men in their 20s. \n \n Synthetic cannabinoids across Chicago and parts of central Illinois have been found to contain brodifacoum, a rat poison, according to state health officials. \n \n Earlier this month, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned about life-threatening bleeding linked to the use of synthetic cannabinoids, often sold as spice, K2 or fake weed . A CDC \"outbreak alert\" noted that there were some bleeding cases also in Indiana, Maryland, Missouri and Wisconsin. \n \n Now, the number of hospitalizations and deaths is continuing to climb. \n \n \"We continue to see new cases of individuals experiencing severe bleeding after using synthetic cannabinoids,\" Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health, said in a written statement Tuesday. \n \n \"Like so many other drugs, synthetic cannabinoids are addictive and people are not able to give them up. Alternatively, they think that it won't happen to them because they know their dealer or trust wherever they purchased the drugs,\" he said. \"If you know someone who uses synthetic cannabinoids, tell them these are deadly products and try to help them get treatment.\" \n \n The US Attorney's Office charged three men with federal drug offenses and accused them of conspiring to sell synthetic cannabinoids at a Chicago convenience store, in connection with some of the cases. \n \n JUST WATCHED Police: Spike in synthetic marijuana overdoses in 2015 Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Police: Spike in synthetic marijuana overdoses in 2015 02:13 \n \n Synthetic cannabinoids are human-made chemicals that can be sprinkled on dried, shredded plant material and smoked or consumed as vaporized liquids inhaled through an e-cigarette or other device. \n \n Although these mind-altering chemicals are called cannabinoids, since they are designed to be similar to the chemicals found in marijuana, their actual impacts on the brain and body are much more powerful. They can cause serious side effects that are different from those of marijuana. \n \n One study of a synthetic cannabinoid, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2016, found that it was 85 times as potent as tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the mind-altering chemical in marijuana. \n \n Since the synthetic cannabinoids in Illinois were found to contain rat poison, most of the hospitalizations have been related to unexplained bleeding, such as coughing up blood, blood in the urine, bloody nose and bleeding gums. \n \n A chemical in rat poison prevents blood from clotting, causing the severe bleeding, according to the state health department. \n \n Health officials warn that anyone who has a reaction to synthetic cannabinoids, such as severe bleeding, should call 911 or be taken to an emergency department immediately. \n \n To treat the bleeding, doctors use high doses of vitamin K, up to 30 tablets a day for up to six months, which can help restore the blood's ability to clot. \n \n Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter. \n \n Since this rising number of cases calls for a large amount of vitamin K and long duration of treatment -- costing up to thousands of dollars for each patient -- the Illinois Department of Public Health announced that it's working to find a way to place no financial burden on patients tied to the synthetic cannabinoids outbreak. \n \n The Bausch Foundation, the charitable organization of Valeant Pharmaceuticals, donated nearly 800,000 tablets of vitamin K to the department.",
    "summary": "\u2013 Another person in Illinois has died after using synthetic marijuana, reports the Chicago Tribune. The central Illinois woman, who was in her 30s, is the fourth person to die in the state after apparent use of the tainted substance. She's the third central Illinois victim; the fourth was from Chicago. In the last few weeks, more than 150 people across 13 counties have been hospitalized after using synthetic pot laced with what health officials believe to be a type of a rat poison known as brodifacoum, a powerful anti-coagulant. A widely used pesticide, when ingested by humans brodifacoum can cause bleeding from the nose or gums, as well as internal bleeding. Symptoms include coughing up blood and bloody urine, health officials say, and brodifacoum poisoning can be treated with vitamin K administered via IV to stabilize the blood\u2019s clotting ability. The treatment is effective if initiated before excessive bleeding occurs, per the American Council on Science and Health. CNN reports health officials urge anyone who has a reaction to synthetic marijuana to call 911 or go to an emergency room.",

If they can't sort it out then, I want them back here tomorrow. But it would be inexcusable for us to not be able to take care of last year's business.\" \n \n \n \n He told lawmakers to \u201cact like grownups.\u201d \n \n \n \n UPDATE: Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Boehner, denied that Boehner told Obama he didn't want the White House team at the meeting. He said in a statement: \"The Speaker never said he didn\u2019t want the White House there, just that he wanted to meet with Senator Reid. Speaker Boehner and Senator Reid have been having regular discussions on this topic for weeks. This is just one of those occasions.\" \n \n \n \n UPDATE 2: Michael Steel, another Boehner spokesman, later said in a statement: \"The Speaker and the Senate Majority Leader sat down privately and had a productive discussion. They agreed to continue working on a budget solution.\" ||||| A visibly frustrated President Barack Obama emerged from a failed meeting on a budget deal Tuesday and said he would demand daily sessions with House Speaker John Boehner until an agreement was hammered out to prevent a U.S. government shutdown at week's end. \n \n House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio walks past media after a closed conference meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, April 5, 2011.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) (Associated Press) \n \n Obama spoke not long after Boehner's office issued a statement that insisted the two sides remained far apart and that Republicans had never, as the White House contends, agreed on $33 billion in cuts to the federal spending allotment for the remaining six months of the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30. \n \n Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Boehner and Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid met in the White House Tuesday as the clock ticked toward a midnight Friday expiration of the government's spending authority. \n \n \"We are closer than we have ever been to an agreement. There is no reason why we should not get an agreement,\" Obama said in a surprise appearance in the White House reporters briefing room. \n \n The president said Boehner and Reid were meeting later Tuesday, but if that session produced no agreement he would summon both men back to the White House Wednesday and daily thereafter, if necessary. \n \n \"Myself, Joe Biden, my team we are prepared to meet for as long as possible to get this resolved,\" Obama said. \n \n Obama had barely finished speaking when Boehner strode before microphones to insist that the White House and Senate Democrats bow to demands for deeper cuts. Boehner is under extreme pressure from newly elected House members, many with allegiance to the ultraconservative tea party, to slash spending, the size of government and lower taxes. \n \n Short of a long-term deal, Boehner has proposed an agreement that would keep the government running for one more week and cut another $12 billion in spending. Boehner has already orchestrated action by Congress to pass a pair of stopgap bills, so far cutting $10 billion from an estimated $1.2 trillion budget to fund the day-to-day operations of government through the fiscal accounting period. \n \n Obama said he would only accept another short-term funding extension, of two or three days, to get a longer-term deal through Congress. But he ruled out a longer extension to allow negotiations to continue. \n \n \"That is not a way to run a government. I cannot have our agencies making plans based on two week budgets,\" Obama said. \"What we are not going to do is once again put off something that should have been done months ago.\" \n \n Boehner said Republicans \"will not be put in a box\" of accepting options they refuse to endorse. \n \n Democrats accuse Republicans of pushing for harmful spending cuts and attaching a social policy agenda to the must-pass spending bill. Boehner counters that the White House is pressing gimmicky budget cuts. \n \n As a government shutdown appeared increasingly inevitable, the White House has begun advising government agencies on the proper steps in preparation for a shutdown of the government. Republicans on Monday disclosed plans to instruct lawmakers \"on how the House would operate in the event Senate Democrats shut down the government.\" \n \n And in a memo to agency officials, the deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, Jeffrey Zients, urged agency heads to refine and update contingency plans in the event negotiators don't strike a deal by Friday's deadline. \n \n Boehner's one-week plan could reassure tea party-backed lawmakers who are among the most vocal in seeking to reduce the size and scope of the government. It could also put pressure on Democrats and the White House to offer greater spending cuts. \n \n But there's no visible movement on an impasse over Republican policy riders attacking Obama's health care and financial reform laws, cutting taxpayer funds to Planned Parenthood and reversing a host of Obama's environmental policies. \n \n On a separate long-term track, Republicans controlling the House have fashioned plans to slash the budget deficit by more than $5 trillion over the upcoming decade, combining unprecedented spending cuts with a fundamental restructuring of taxpayer-financed health care for the elderly and the poor. \n \n House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan unveiled the Republican budget blueprint Tuesday morning just as Boehner headed to the White House. \n \n Ryan's program includes a controversial proposal to convert the traditional Medicare health care program for the aged into a system by which private insurers would operate plans approved by the federal government. \n \n Current Medicare beneficiaries or workers age 55 and older would stay in the existing system. \n \n At the same time, Republicans propose to sharply cut projected spending on the Medicaid state-federal health program for the poor and disabled and transform it into a block grant program that gives governors far less money than under current estimates, but considerably more flexibility.",

Williams, who has written extensively on race and civil rights in the U.S., has been... (Associated Press) \n \n In a statement late Wednesday, National Public Radio said it was terminating Williams' contract as a senior news analyst over his comments on Fox's \"The O'Reilly Factor.\" \n \n NPR executives had previously complained about his remarks on Fox and asked him to stop using the NPR name when he appeared on O'Reilly's show. \n \n The latest comments came Monday, when O'Reilly brought on guests to discuss his own appearance last week on ABC's \"The View,\" during which Joy Behar and Whoopi Goldberg walked off the set to protest his views on Muslims. \n \n \"Where am I going wrong here, Juan?\" O'Reilly asked. \n \n Williams, 56, responded that too much political correctness can get in the way of reality. \n \n \"I mean, look, Bill, I'm not a bigot. You know the kind of books I've written about the civil rights movement in this country,\" Williams said. \"But when I get on a plane, I got to tell you, if I see people who are in Muslim garb and I think, you know, they are identifying themselves first and foremost as Muslims, I get worried. I get nervous.\" \n \n He went on to say that not everyone in a religious group _ Christian or Muslim _ should be lumped together with extremists. \n \n NPR CEO Vivian Schiller said that controversial opinions should not come from NPR reporters or news analysts and that whatever feelings Williams has about Muslims should be between him and \"his psychiatrist or his publicist.\" \n \n Speaking Thursday at the Atlanta Press Club, Schiller also said Williams had veered from journalistic ethics several times before Monday's comments. \n \n Republicans blasted NPR's decision. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told Fox News that Congress should investigate NPR for censorship and consider cutting off its public funding. NPR receives federal funding through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, but it amounts to a small part of its budget. \n \n \"Juan Williams: Going Rogue,\" former GOP vice presidental candidate Sarah Palin said Thursday in a Twitter message. \"NPR should receive NO fed tax dollars if it operates as intolerant, private radio. Mr. President, what say you?\" \n \n Goldberg also defended Williams on \"The View\" Thursday. \"The point he was trying to say is, 'I get nervous,' and that's OK,\" she said. \"Firing him for saying that I think is kind of ridiculous.\" \n \n A phone message left for Williams at his home in Washington was not immediately returned Thursday morning, but on Fox News he stood by his remarks and said his statement was not bigoted. \n \n Williams said he was abruptly fired Wednesday by Ellen Weiss, NPR's vice president for news. He said he told Weiss he meant what he said on the O'Reilly show, but that she told him he had made a bigoted statement and crossed a line. \n \n \"I said, 'You mean I don't even get the chance to come in and we do this eyeball-to-eyeball, person-to-person, have a conversation? I've been there more than 10 years,\" Williams said. He said Weiss responded that \"there's nothing you can say that would change my mind.\" \n \n Before Williams was fired, the Council on American-Islamic Relations said such commentary from a journalist about other racial, ethnic or religious minority groups should not be tolerated. \n \n \"NPR should address the fact that one of its news analysts seems to believe that all airline passengers who are perceived to be Muslim can legitimately be viewed as security threats,\" CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad said. \n \n Later Wednesday, NPR issued a statement saying Williams' remarks \"were inconsistent with our editorial standards and practices, and undermined his credibility as a news analyst with NPR.\" \n \n \"Juan has been a valuable contributor to NPR and public radio for many years and we did not make this decision lightly or without regret,\" NPR spokeswoman Dana Davis Rehm said in an e-mailed statement. \n \n The discussion began with a chat about O'Reilly's comments on ABC's \"The View\" opposing a proposed mosque near the World Trade Center site in New York. The imam behind that project issued a statement Thursday, saying some news organizations are perpetuating anti-Islamic sentiments. \n \n \"While I am saddened that Mr. Williams has lost his job with NPR, this episode serves as a reminder that we should be looking for similarities among religions and cultures rather than differences,\" Imam Feisal Rauf said. \"Divisiveness only serves to fuel the downward spiral of hate and misunderstanding between the Islamic and Western worlds.\" \n \n Williams' appearances on Fox have been an issue for NPR in the past, including his remarks about Michelle Obama on a 2009 episode of \"The O'Reilly Factor.\" \n \n \"Michelle Obama, you know, she's got this Stokely Carmichael in a designer dress thing going. ... her instinct is to start with this blame America, you know, I'm the victim,\" Williams said, according to an account by NPR's Ombudsman Alicia Shepard. Carmichael was a civil rights activist. \n \n At the time, Shepard wrote that Williams was the network's biggest \"lightning rod,\" drawing hundreds of complaints. NPR executives then asked Williams to stop using the NPR name when he appears on O'Reilly's show. \n \n On Monday, he was identified as a Fox News contributor. \n \n Williams was a longtime reporter, columnist and editorial writer at The Washington Post. He has written extensively on the civil rights movement, including a book on the African-American religious experience and a biography of Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press Writer Greg Bluestein in Atlanta contributed to this report. ||||| UPDATE: Fox News announced Thursday that it had signed Juan Williams to a new, multi-year contract, which the Los Angeles Times reported was worth $2 million. Among other things, Williams will now write columns for FoxNews.com, the first of which appeared on Thursday afternoon. \n \n In the column, Williams excoriated NPR and its leadership for the decision to fire him. He said he was let go for \"telling the truth\" about his feelings of nervousness when he sees people he thinks are clearly Muslim on airplanes. He called his debate with Bill O'Reilly -- where he also told the Fox News host to be careful about painting all Muslims as extremists -- an \"honest, sensitive\" one \"in the best American tradition of a fair, full-throated and honest discourse about the issues of the day.\" \n \n Williams said that NPR's move to fire him was a \"a chilling assault on free speech\" that came about due to \"political correctness and ideological orthodoxy\" by the \"self-righteous ideological, left-wing leadership at NPR.\" He also recounted the years of tension between him and his bosses at NPR that resulted from his association with Fox. \n \n Williams concluded by comparing himself to Daniel Schorr, the longtime NPR contributor who found himself on Richard Nixon's enemies list. \n \n \"I can only imagine Dan's revulsion to realize that today NPR treats a journalist who has worked for them for ten years with less regard, less respect for the value of independence of thought and embrace of real debate across political lines, than Nixon ever displayed,\" he wrote. \n \n ORIGINAL POST: Juan Williams appeared on Fox News' \"Happening Now\" Thursday morning to discuss his firing from NPR over his comments about Muslims on Monday's \"O'Reilly Factor.\" (h/t Johnny Dollar.) \n \n Williams said that he received a message from Ellen Weiss, NPR's senior vice president for news, telling him to call her. When he did, he said, she asked him to clarify his comments that he gets \"nervous\" when he sees Muslims on an airplane. \n \n \"I said, 'I said what I meant to say,'\" Williams told Fox News, \"which is that it is an honest experience that when I'm in an airport and I see people in Muslim garb who identify themselves first and foremost as Muslims, I do a double take. I have a moment of anxiety or fear given what happened on 9/11. That's just a reality.\" \n \n Weiss, he said, told him that he had crossed the line. When he asked what line that was, she said that his statement had been bigoted. Williams said he had pointed out that he had gone on to tell O'Reilly that America had \"an obligation to protect the constitutional rights of everyone in the country\" and to prevent bigotry, but that \"you cannot ignore what happened on 9/11 and you cannot ignore the connection to Islamic radicalism.\" \n \n In response, Williams said, Weiss told him that the decision to fire him had already been taken. \n \n \"I said, 'I don't even get the chance to come in and we do this eyeball to eyeball, person to person?'\" he continued. \"She said, 'there's nothing you can say that will change my mind, this has been decided above me and we're terminating your contract.'\" \n \n NPR President Vivian Schiller also spoke out about the firing on Thursday. According to the Associated Press, Schiller appeared at the Atlanta Press Club, where she defended the decision, saying that Williams had violated NPR's guidelines barring its analysts from making personal or controversial statements. She also said that he should keep his feelings about Muslims between himself and \"his psychiatrist or his publicist.\" (UPDATE: Schiller apologized for that comment on Thursday afternoon, saying in a statement that \"I spoke hastily and I apologize to Juan and others for my thoughtless remark.\") \n \n In addition, Schiller released a statement about the firing to NPR member stations on Thursday. In it, she wrote that \"this isn't the first time we have had serious concerns about some of Juan's public comments. Despite many conversations and warnings over the years, Juan has continued to violate this principle.\" Schiller also wrote that Williams had violated NPR's code of ethics by expressing views that he would not have expressed on NPR. \n \n \"Unfortunately, Juan's comments on Fox violated our standards as well as our values and offended many in doing so,\" she said. \n \n Williams will appear on \"The O'Reilly Factor\" Thursday night to discuss the firing as well.",

    "document": "LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May survived a confidence vote from her Conservative party on Wednesday, but more than a third of her lawmakers said she was no longer the right leader to implement Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union. \n \n Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May speaks at Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons, London, Britain, December 12, 2018. Parliament TV handout via REUTERS \n \n Britain\u2019s March 29 exit has been plunged into crisis by parliamentary opposition to the divorce deal she struck with the EU last month, which has opened up possibilities including a delay to Brexit or even another referendum on membership. \n \n May on Monday cancelled a parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal, designed to maintain close future ties with the bloc and agreed after two years of negotiations, after it became clear she would lose it badly. \n \n Eurosceptic critics of the deal within her own party triggered a no-confidence vote in her leadership hours after she returned from talks with European leaders aimed at winning additional assurances about her deal. \n \n After two hours of voting in Committee Room 14 in the House of Commons, Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers, said 200 Conservative lawmakers had voted in support of May as leader, and 117 against, indicating her party was bitterly divided over the direction of Brexit. \n \n Supporters said the result showed the party should now get behind her. But the hardline Brexit supporters who triggered the vote because they saw her deal as a betrayal of the 2016 referendum said she should now quit. \n \n \u201cIt is a terrible result for the prime minister,\u201d Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of a hard Brexit faction in the party, told BBC Television. \u201cThe prime minister must realise that, under all constitutional norms, she ought to go and see the queen urgently and resign.\u201d \n \n But May loyalist Chris Grayling, her transport minister, said the party had endorsed her \u201ccomfortably\u201d. \n \n ENDANGERING BREXIT? \n \n May, who voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, had warned opponents of her withdrawal deal - struck after two years of negotiations - that if they toppled her, Brexit would be delayed or stopped. \n \n Shortly before the vote, May sought to win over wavering lawmakers by promising to step down before the 2022 election. \n \n Brexit is Britain\u2019s most significant political and economic decision since World War Two. Pro-Europeans fear the departure will weaken the West as it grapples with the U.S. presidency of Donald Trump and growing assertiveness from Russia and China. \n \n The outcome will shape Britain\u2019s $2.8 trillion economy, have far-reaching consequences for the unity of the kingdom and determine whether London keeps its place as one of the top two global financial centres. \n \n Supporters of Brexit admit there may be some short-term pain for Britain\u2019s $2.9 trillion economy, but say it will prosper in the long term when cut free from the EU, which they cast as a failing German-dominated experiment in European integration. \n \n May, 62, won the top job in the turmoil that followed the 2016 EU referendum, where Britons decided by 52 percent to 48 to leave the EU. She promised to implement Brexit while keeping close ties to the bloc, to heal a divided nation. \n \n Sterling jumped as high as $1.2672 GBP=D3 as the result came in but then fell to $1.2605, still up 1 percent on the day, after it emerged that the number of lawmakers who had voted against May was higher than many in the markets had expected. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Theresa May smiles at gathered journalists as she awaits the result \n \n Theresa May is awaiting the result of a vote by Conservative MPs on whether they want to keep her as their leader. \n \n The UK prime minister made a last-minute appeal for support at an emotional meeting of backbench MPs. \n \n She told them she will not lead the party into the next scheduled election in 2022 - but wants to stay on to deliver her Brexit deal, MPs said. \n \n She faces a vote of confidence in her leadership after 48 Conservative MPs called for one to be held. \n \n The majority of Conservative MPs have publicly said they will support the PM but it is a secret ballot and there were signs of nerves among party managers ahead of the vote in Committee Room 14 at the Palace of Westminster. \n \n Voting finished at 20:00 with the result expected within the next hour. \n \n The prime minister was greeted with applause, and the traditional banging of desks, as she went in to the committee room to address her MPs. Some of them were reported to be in tears. \n \n She is understood to have promised not to call a \"snap general election\" and told MPs that in her heart she would have liked to have led them into the next scheduled election, partly because of what had happened at last year's election, when she lost her majority. \n \n But, she added: \"I realise that the party would like a different leader to take them into that election.\" \n \n Cabinet minister Amber Rudd said \"she was very clear that she wont be taking the general election in 2022\". \n \n But Jacob Rees-Mogg, a key figure in the campaign to oust Mrs May, said she had received a \"half-hearted\" reception from MPs. \n \n She had said it was not her \"intention\" to fight the next election, added Mr Rees-Mogg, which he said was a \"politician's word\". \n \n Marcus Fysh, who also submitted a no confidence letter, said Mrs May \"didn't really have anything new to say\" about Brexit. \n \n She vowed to involve more people in developing policy, the MP told BBC News, but he did not think that would happen. \n \n And he predicted that the prime minister would face a no-confidence vote of all MPs - not just Conservative ones - when she tried to get her Brexit deal through the Commons. \n \n \"Whatever happens tonight I don't think she will be able to command the confidence of the House for the type of Brexit she is trying to pursue.\" \n \n Minister Margot James said she was \"proud\" to have voted for the PM, tweeting a picture of her ballot paper. \n \n Conservative Party rules say that if she wins tonight she can stay on as leader, undisturbed, for another 12 months. \n \n That takes one uncertainty off the table. But she would be weaker - lonelier - and with less authority to drive her Brexit compromise through. \n \n Already, cabinet ministers are speculating about which way she can tack. \n \n The parliamentary sums don't change on her current planned agreement with the EU. The cabinet, let alone the rest of the Commons, won't give their backing. \n \n Read Laura's blog \n \n Can she survive the confidence vote? \n \n Immediate statements of loyalty for the prime minister were issued by every member of her cabinet, including several who have been touted as possible successors. \n \n Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Mrs May was \"the best person to make sure we actually leave the EU on March 29\", while Chancellor Philip Hammond suggested the vote would \"flush out the extremists\" in his party whose Brexit agenda was \"not in the interests of the British people\". \n \n So far, 174 Tory MPs have publicly said they will vote for her, with 34 publicly against, according to BBC research. She needs to secure the votes of 159 MPs to survive. \n \n If Mrs May wins the confidence vote she cannot be challenged as Conservative leader for at least another year. \n \n If she does not win the vote there would then be a Conservative leadership contest in which she could not stand. \n \n If Mrs May won - but not overwhelmingly - she may decide to stand down as party leader and trigger a leadership contest in which she could not stand. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Sir Graham Brady says he phoned the prime minister to advise her the threshold of 48 letters had been reached \n \n What has Theresa May said? \n \n In her statement delivered early on Wednesday morning, Mrs May said: \"A leadership election would not change the fundamentals of the negotiation or the Parliamentary arithmetic. \n \n \"Weeks spent tearing ourselves apart will only create more division just as we should be standing together to serve our country. None of that would be in the national interest.\" \n \n She said she was making progress in her talks with EU leaders and vowed to \"deliver on the referendum vote and seize the opportunities that lie ahead\". \n \n The Conservatives had to build a \"country that works for everyone\" and deliver \"the Brexit people voted for\". \n \n \"I have devoted myself unsparingly to these tasks ever since I became prime minister and I stand ready to finish the job.\" \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption \"I stand ready to finish the job\" - Theresa May \n \n Will there be a new prime minister if she loses the vote? \n \n Not immediately. She would be expected to stay on as a caretaker prime minister until a new Conservative leader is selected by the party, a process that could take up to six weeks. \n \n If there are multiple candidates, Conservative MPs hold a series of votes to choose two to go forward to a vote of party members. \n \n As leader of the largest party in the Commons, the new Conservative leader would then be expected to be asked to form a government and become prime minister, without a general election. \n \n It's Wednesday, so... Prime Minister's Questions \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jeremy Corbyn criticises Theresa May at PMQs \n \n Mrs May faced repeated calls from Labour MPs for her to quit - or hold another EU referendum - at a rowdy Prime Minister's Questions. \n \n Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: \"The time for dithering and delay is over. The prime minister has negotiated her deal. She has told us it is the best and only deal available. \n \n \"There can be no more excuses, no more running away. Put it before Parliament and let's have the vote.\" \n \n Mrs May said the vote will take place, and as Labour MPs shouted \"when?\" at her she said: \"We've had a meaningful vote, we had it in in the referendum in 2016.\" \n \n The PM added: \"And if he wants a meaningful date I'll give him one; 29 March 2019 when we leave the European Union.\" \n \n Veteran pro-European MP Ken Clarke called the prospect of a leadership contest \"unhelpful, irrelevant and irresponsible\", prompting loud cheers from the Tory benches. \n \n But the SNP's leader at Westminster Ian Blackford called on Mrs May to stand down, saying her government was \"an embarrassment\". \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'The inconstant gardener' - May's PMQs swipe at Labour \n \n Who is trying to oust Mrs May? \n \n Image copyright PA Image caption Jacob Rees-Mogg: In the national interest, she must go \n \n The challenge has been brought by Conservative MPs who think Mrs May has watered down the Brexit voters were promised in the 2016 referendum. \n \n The PM thought she had seen off an attempt by this group of Brexiteers to get rid of her last month. \n \n But her decision to cancel Tuesday's Parliamentary vote on her deal at the last minute proved to be the final straw for many who had previously given her the benefit of the doubt. \n \n There needed to be 48 MPs calling for her to go - out of 317 Conservative MPs - to trigger a confidence vote and this threshold was reached on Tuesday. \n \n Jacob Rees-Mogg, who has led backbench calls for her to go, said: \"Theresa May's plan would bring down the government if carried forward. But our party will rightly not tolerate it. \n \n \"Conservatives must now answer whether they wish to draw ever closer to an election under Mrs May's leadership. In the national interest, she must go.\" \n \n And Bernard Jenkin said the survival of the Conservative government depended on the support of the Democratic Unionists, who he said had lost faith in Mrs May. \n \n Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, who is campaigning for a further referendum, told BBC Radio 2 she hoped Mr Rees-Mogg's group would \"get a kicking\" in the vote and that their \"pompous gesturing\" will be exposed. \n \n Why are they trying to get rid of her? \n \n They don't like the deal she has struck with the EU, which they say will keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely with no say over its rules and unable to strike trade deals around the world. \n \n Anger has focused on the so-called \"backstop\" to prevent the return of a physical border in Northern Ireland. \n \n Mrs May has said she is seeking guarantees that this clause will be \"temporary\" but the Democratic Unionist Party, which she relies on to win key votes, wants the backstop to be ditched altogether. \n \n And her Conservative critics think she will not be able to get anything more than cosmetic changes to her withdrawal deal because EU leaders say it can not be renegotiated. \n \n Who are the frontrunners to lead the party if she loses? \n \n Image copyright AFP Image caption Jeremy Hunt, Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, Michael Gove, Sajid Javid and Amber Rudd \n \n There are many names being floated, with Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd among cabinet ministers rated by the bookmakers. \n \n Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and ex-Brexit Secretary David Davis are the ex-cabinet ministers also judged to be in the running. \n \n But, as BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says, the field of hopefuls could be much larger and, initially at least, resemble the start of a Grand National. \n \n What does it mean for Brexit? \n \n Whatever the outcome of the vote, Mrs May is still likely to represent the UK at Thursday's summit of EU leaders, although that might change if she loses the Tory leadership. \n \n She has been invited to update her 27 counterparts on the state of Brexit before they meet to \"adopt relevant conclusions\". \n \n European Council President Donald Tusk has said the \"seriousness\" of the situation in the UK means the EU must accelerate its no-deal planning. \n \n Mrs May met Germany's Angela Merkel and top EU officials on Tuesday as part of efforts to get changes to her EU deal to get it through the UK Parliament. \n \n But she was forced to call off talks with Irish premier Leo Varadkar, among others, on Wednesday to fight for her leadership. \n \n Mrs May says any new Conservative leader would have to delay Brexit to renegotiate a deal with the EU while she has also suggested a leadership contest will effectively hand control of the Brexit process to MPs - many of whom either back leaving without a deal or having another referendum. \n \n Many of those calling for her to go say they would be happy for the UK to leave the EU on World Trade Organization terms, without a deal. They say warnings of economic doom are exaggerated. ||||| 19:29 \n \n What about the \u2018meaningful vote\u2019? \n \n The result clearly highlights May\u2019s essential Brexit problem. The number of rebels at 117 is eyecatchingly similar to the 100 or so MPs who were planning to vote against her Brexit deal before she postponed the vote a day before its scheduled date of Tuesday. \n \n It is a blocking minority preventing the current deal, or anything like it, from being ratified by parliament. To win round that amount of rebels, May has to make dramatic progress in her talks with Brussels and persuade the right of her party that she can \u201cbin the backstop\u201d. \n \n However, the European Union has made it repeatedly clear that the legally binding 585-page withdrawal agreement \u2013 which contains the Northern Irish backstop \u2013 is not up for renegotiation. And without renegotiation, the backstop will endure and Tory rebels will almost certainly not vote for it. \n \n No 10 has promised that the vote will happen before 21 January, which in negotiating terms is very little time at all. So the Brexit fundamentals at Westminster remain, for now, unchanged. ||||| Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May makes a statement in Downing Street, London, confirming there will be a vote of confidence in her leadership of the Conservative Party, Wednesday Dec. 12, 2018. The... (Associated Press) \n \n LONDON (AP) \u2014 The Latest on political turmoil in Britain (all times local): \n \n 5:35 p.m. \n \n Prime Minister Theresa May is speaking to dozens of Conservative lawmakers, less than half an hour before a no-confidence vote among them that will decide her fate. \n \n May was greeted by table banging as she entered a room in the House of Commons to address backbenchers. \n \n That is a customary sign of approval, but May faces a tough crowd that includes rivals such as former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and ex-Brexit Secretary David Davis. \n \n Both are among critics of May's Brexit deal with the European Union. \n \n Tory Brexiteers are hoping to topple May in Wednesday evening's vote. She is making a last-minute appeal, saying ditching her now would plunge the country into even more uncertainty. \n \n One lawmaker who attended, James Cleverly, said May \"made it very clear that there is a job of work to be done (on Brexit) and this is a delay and a distraction.\" \n \n ___ \n \n 4:25 p.m. \n \n British bookmakers William Hill say they've suspended betting on the question of whether Prime Minister Theresa May will win a confidence vote by her party. \n \n William Hill spokesman Rupert Adams says that the odds favored May from the beginning of the day, and did nothing but improve as Wednesday night's vote neared. Before betting was suspended, people putting money on a May win had to wager 10 pounds to win one pound. \n \n Adams says the firm suspended betting because \"we're 100 percent certain she's going to win.\" \n \n ___ \n \n 4 p.m. \n \n Some Londoners are reacting with sympathy at the news that Prime Minister Theresa May faces a confidence vote that may remove her from power. \n \n Abby Handbridge, a trader at Chapel Market in north London, said Wednesday that the spectacle was \"embarrassing\" for Britain in the eyes of the world. \n \n \"I feel really sorry for Theresa May,\" she said. \"She's being battered by everybody and Boris Johnson has just come out with a haircut and weight loss so we know what he is looking for.\" \n \n Another trader, 61-year-old David White, compared May's Conservative Party challengers to \"rats deserting a sinking ship.\" \n \n \"I don't think it should have come to this,\" he said of the formal challenge to May. \n \n Support was hardly unanimous, though, with some traders saying May is power hungry. \n \n Lawmakers casting their votes of confidence in a secret ballot later Wednesday. \n \n ___ \n \n 1:45 p.m. \n \n Germany's Cabinet has approved legislation to protect British residents' rights in the country in the event of a no-deal Brexit and to make the country a more attractive location for banks seeking to relocate. \n \n Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said ministers have approved a bill safeguarding the German health insurance, unemployment insurance and pension status of British citizens living in Germany and German citizens living in Britain at the time of Brexit. \n \n The future status of those citizens affected by the Brexit process remains especially uncertain following the news earlier that Prime Minister Theresa May will face a no-confidence vote later from lawmakers in her own party. A withdrawal agreement ahead of Britain's exit from the European Union in March has yet to be voted on by the British Parliament. \n \n Another German bill foresees loosening the requirement for banks to justify why they're ending a contract with a highly paid employee deemed to be a \"bearer of risk,\" such as heads of department or high-volume traders. \n \n Germany has much more restrictive rules on dismissing workers than Britain, which is seen as a disincentive for Britain-based banks to shift operations to Frankfurt. \n \n ___ \n \n 12:25 p.m. \n \n German Chancellor Angela Merkel is underlining the European Union's insistence on sticking to the Brexit agreement as it stands, but stressing that she remains committed to an orderly British withdrawal. \n \n Merkel, who met Tuesday with British Prime Minister Theresa May, noted that \"things are in flux\" in London. \n \n She said that \"we do not have any intention of changing the withdrawal agreement\" but otherwise didn't go into detail. \n \n Merkel said that Germany remains committed to securing an orderly British withdrawal, and said that \"we don't have much time, but we still have time.\" \n \n ___ \n \n 10:55 a.m. \n \n Business figures have expressed alarm about the political uncertainty in the U.K. ahead of a Conservative Party confidence vote on Prime Minister Theresa May later. \n \n Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said politicians should understand the impact of their \"high stakes gambles\" with Britain's economy. \n \n \"At one of the most pivotal moments for the U.K. economy in decades, it is unacceptable that Westminster politicians have chosen to focus on themselves, rather than on the needs of the country,\" he said after the Conservative Party said there would a vote on May's leadership. \n \n He said there was \"utter dismay\" among businesses about the vote on Wednesday evening. \n \n Federation of Small Businesses chairman Mike Cherry said the current turmoil is \"weighing heavy\" on entrepreneurs. \n \n ___ \n \n 9 a.m. \n \n British Prime Minister Theresa May says a change of national leader would result in Britain's departure from the European Union being delayed or stopped, as she vowed to fight to stay in power. \n \n May made the defiant statement outside Downing Street on Wednesday, arguing that stepping aside at a time of crisis would \"put our country's future at risk and create uncertainty when we can least afford it.\" \n \n The U.K. leader is facing a no-confidence vote that will see her removed as party and government leader if she loses. \n \n ___ \n \n 8:50 a.m. \n \n U.K. leader Theresa May is vowing to fight a no-confidence vote \"with everything I've got,\" appealing to party colleagues to support her leadership. \n \n The announcement of the challenge to May's leadership throws Britain's already rocky path out of the European Union, which it is due to leave in March, into further chaos. \n \n Many Tory lawmakers have been growing angry with May over her handling of Brexit, and the challenge comes days after she postponed a vote to approve a divorce deal with the EU to avoid all but certain defeat. \n \n If she loses Wednesday's vote, May must step down and there will be a contest to choose a new leader. She will remain leader, and prime minister, until the successor is picked. If she wins, she can't be challenged again for a year. \n \n ___ \n \n 7:55 a.m. \n \n A British Conservative Party official says Prime Minister Theresa May will face a no-confidence vote from party lawmakers. \n \n Graham Brady says the threshold of 48 letters from lawmakers needed to trigger a leadership vote has been reached. Brady chairs the party committee that oversees leadership contests. \n \n Many lawmakers have been growing angry with May over her handling of Brexit. \n \n If she loses the vote of party legislators, taking place on Wednesday evening, May must step down.

(Bill O\u2019Leary /The Washington Post) \n \n On the morning after Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, acting National Park Service director Michael T. Reynolds received an extraordinary summons: The new president wanted to talk to him. \n \n In a Saturday phone call, Trump personally ordered Reynolds to produce additional photographs of the previous day\u2019s crowds on the Mall, according to three individuals who have knowledge of the conversation. The president believed that the photos might prove that the media had lied in reporting that attendance had been no better than average. \n \n Trump also expressed anger over a retweet sent from the agency\u2019s account, in which side-by-side photographs showed far fewer people at his swearing-in than had shown up to see Barack Obama\u2019s inauguration in 2009. \n \n According to one account, Reynolds had been contacted by the White House and given a phone number to call. When he dialed it, he was told to hold for the president. \n \n For Trump, who sees himself and his achievements in superlative terms, the inauguration\u2019s crowd size has been a source of grievance that he appears unable to put behind him. It is a measure of his fixation on the issue that he would devote part of his first morning in office to it \u2014 and that he would take out his frustrations on an acting Park Service director. \n \n (The Washington Post) \n \n Word rapidly spread through the agency and Washington. The individuals who informed The Washington Post about the call did so on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the conversation. \n \n Neither Reynolds nor the Park Service would talk about it. \n \n \u201cThe National Park Service does not comment on internal conversations among administration officials,\u201d agency spokesman Thomas Crosson said. \n \n White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the call simply demonstrated that Trump\u2019s management style is to be \u201cso accessible, and constantly in touch.\u201d \n \n \u201cHe\u2019s not somebody who sits around and waits. He takes action and gets things done,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons that he is president today, and Hillary Clinton isn\u2019t.\u201d \n \n On Saturday, the same day Trump spoke with Reynolds, the new president used an appearance at CIA headquarters to deliver a blistering attack on the media for reporting that large swaths of the Mall were nearly empty during the event. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a lie,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe caught [the media].

Experts, however, have estimated that the 2017 turnout was no more than a third the size of Obama\u2019s eight years earlier. \n \n Reynolds was taken aback by Trump\u2019s request, but he did secure some additional aerial photographs and forwarded them to the White House through normal channels in the Interior Department, the people who notified The Post said. The photos, however, did not prove Trump\u2019s contention that the crowd size was upward of 1 million. \n \n Reynolds, who had served as the Park Service\u2019s deputy director of operations for six months before assuming the post of acting director, is a third-generation employee who has worked there for more than 30 years. As deputy director, he oversaw the Park Service\u2019s $2.8 billion budget and more than 22,000 employees. \n \n In the days since Trump\u2019s election, the Park Service has become an unlikely protagonist in a battle between the new president and some career government employees. \n \n The trouble began late Friday, when the agency\u2019s official Twitter account retweeted two messages that could be perceived as critical of the new administration: the one comparing the relative crowd size for Trump\u2019s inauguration to that of Obama\u2019s 2009 swearing-in, and another that noted policy pages that had been removed from the White House\u2019s website. \n \n That prompted an \u201curgent directive\u201d to Interior employees that they \u201cshut down Twitter platforms immediately until further notice,\u201d which was lifted early Saturday morning. Crosson then apologized on Twitter for \u201cmistaken RTs from our account.\u201d \n \n On Tuesday, the Badlands National Park\u2019s Twitter account became a social-media sensation when it posted four tweets in a row about rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and the threats posed by climate change. \n \n Those tweets were then deleted. An NPS official later explained that Badlands NPS officials learned they were posted by a former employee who still had access to the account, and decided to remove them. \n \n [Interior Department reactivates Twitter accounts after shutdown following inauguration] \n \n Spicer told reporters this week that White House officials had not dictated any agency to impose new restrictions on public communications and that some federal officials, such as those at the Park Service, were not in compliance with their own department\u2019s policies. \n \n Trump, meanwhile, has continued to press the argument that the media has given a misleading account of the crowds that attended his inauguration. \n \n \u201cI had a massive amount of people here,\u201d the president told ABC News anchor David Muir in an interview Wednesday. \u201cThey were showing pictures that were very unflattering, as unflattering \u2014 from certain angles \u2014 that were taken early and lots of other things.\u201d \n \n As he guided Muir through the West Wing, Trump paused at a photo on the wall, taken from behind him as he delivered his inaugural address: \u201cHere\u2019s a picture of the event. Here\u2019s a picture of the crowd. Now, the audience was the biggest ever, but this crowd was massive. Look how far back it goes. This crowd was massive.\u201d \n \n Brady Dennis and Lisa Rein contributed to this report.",

Reynolds, the National Park Service's acting director, to demand more photos of the crowd on the National Mall. Reynolds, who has worked for the service for 30 years, was \"taken aback\" by the request, but he sent some aerial photos to Trump, according to the Post's sources. The photos did not, however, provide proof of Trump's claim that more than a million people had gathered to watch his inauguration.

The former Penn State assistant football coach was sentenced Tuesday to at least 30 years in prison for molesting 10 boys. \n \n The retirement system told Sandusky he will no longer receive his $4,908 monthly annuity and informed his wife, Dottie, she is no longer entitled to a survivor's benefit. \n \n Sandusky's lawyer, Karl Rominger, contended the agency has no legal grounds for revoking the pension and said Sandusky will fight any attempt to do so. \n \n \"It's my inclination to believe that they are just going through the motions to try to throw some red meat to the public, but they know they are going to lose,\" Rominger said. \n \n Pennsylvania's pension forfeiture law, originally passed in 1978, primarily applies to public employees convicted of a financial crime related to the office \"or when his public employment places him in a position to commit the crime.\" \n \n Since 2004, it has also applied to any public school employee convicted of a sex crime against a student. \n \n In its letter to Sandusky, the retirement system said it had determined that two of the criminal charges of which Sandusky was convicted _ involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and indecent assault _ fell under the forfeiture law. \n \n It also said Sandusky maintained extensive ties to Penn State after his 1999 retirement, qualifying him as a \"de facto\" employee subject to forfeiture for crimes committed even when he was no longer on the university's payroll. \n \n SERS' letter to Sandusky was released to The Associated Press in response to an open-records request. \n \n Rominger argued in part that since Sandusky wasn't convicted of molesting a Penn State student, the forfeiture law does not apply to him. Sandusky's young victims came to him through The Second Mile, his charity for troubled youth. \n \n \"It did not involve students where he worked, and that's going to be the crux,\" Rominger said. \n \n But Philadelphia attorney Alaine Williams, an expert on public employee labor law, said courts have broadly construed the forfeiture law. \n \n \"I think he's got a very serious problem,\" she said ahead of the retirement system's announcement. \n \n Sandusky entered the State Employees' Retirement System when he began working as a Penn State football coach in 1969. He collected a $148,000 lump sum payment when he retired from the university in 1999, and began receiving a monthly annuity, according to records provided by SERS. Sandusky received a total of $900,000 in pension payments between 1999 and September 2012. \n \n The forfeiture statute permits an employee to keep his or her contributions without interest, minus any fees or restitution association with the employee's conviction. Employees subject to forfeiture can appeal to the board of the State Employees' Retirement System, then through the state court system. ||||| Story highlights In letters to judge, Sanduskys portray themselves as virtuous victims \n \n The letters all but guaranteed a maximum punishment, legal observers say \n \n \"Sentencing is a time to ask for mercy, not to attack others,\" one expert says \n \n Adopted Sandusky son disappointed by his parents' smearing of his character, lawyers say \n \n When all was said and done, Jerry and Dottie Sandusky did not ask the judge for mercy. They did not try to extol Jerry's virtues, list good deeds or express regret. Instead, they depicted the boys he sexually assaulted as ungrateful and called them liars. \n \n They blamed the young men -- including their own adopted son, Matt, who now claims he, too, was molested -- for their downfall. \n \n In letters to the judge who would sentence the former coach, the Sanduskys portrayed themselves as virtuous victims of a vast conspiracy. They blamed powerful, image-conscious forces at Penn State University, lying cops, ambitious prosecutors and a scandal-hungry news media. \n \n Victims angrily confront Sandusky at sentencing \n \n JUST WATCHED Sandusky victim: 'I do not forgive you' Replay More Videos ...

MUST WATCH Prosecutor: Sandusky was delusional 01:16 \n \n The couple's letters were mentioned in court on Tuesday but not read aloud. Judge John Cleland and the Centre County courts made them public, and CNN obtained copies. \n \n In them, Jerry Sandusky expressed little sympathy for the 10 boys he was convicted of molesting. As he wrote about their families, he tried to shift the blame, pointing out that the boys came from unstable homes. \n \n \"Nobody mentioned the impact of abandonment, neglect, abuse, insecurity and conflicting messages that the biological parents might have had in this,\" he wrote. He said nothing about the damaged lives and institutions his molestation case left in its wake. \n \n Read the letters (.PDF) \n \n Instead, both Sanduskys wrote that the justice system let them down. \n \n Just as letters to one of the boys he was accused of molesting helped secure his conviction, the letters to the judge all but guaranteed a maximum punishment, legal observers say. \n \n Cleland, who presided over the trial and sentenced Sandusky on Tuesday to 30 to 60 years in prison, noted that others wrote letters as well. But he indicated that he considered only the Sanduskys' letters in handing down a sentence that, for a 68-year-old man, is likely to be a life prison term. \n \n Victim to Sandusky: 'Because of you, I trust no one' \n \n \"Sentencing is a time to ask for mercy, not to attack others,\" said Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor who teaches legal ethics at Loyola Law School. \"In my experience, judges really hate letters that try to shift the blame to others or which belittle the victims or the court.\" \n \n B.J. Bernstein, an Atlanta attorney who comments on legal matters for CNN, agreed that Sandusky didn't do himself any favors. \n \n \"The old adage 'if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all' applies to sentencing statements,\" Bernstein said. \"It is awkward when you deny you are culpable and a jury says otherwise. For appellate purposes Sandusky was never going to accept responsibility or admit doing something wrong, but lashing out at everyone so strongly was irrational.\" \n \n She added that Sandusky might have thought he was still playing to his Penn State fan base, but it backfired. \n \n \"Between Jerry and Dottie's vicious protestations of innocence,\" Bernstein said, \"all I can think is the victims -- and in particular their son Matt -- should shout back the lyrics from the Eric Clapton song, 'Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself.'\" \n \n Sandusky's son comes forward as victim \n \n Jerry Sandusky bashed victims and laid out the conspiracy theory in a pre-recorded interview leaked to a campus radio station on the eve of his sentencing. He hinted at it again when he spoke in court on Tuesday, after being warned by his lawyers to avoid criticizing his victims or the justice system. \n \n His performances on air and in the courtroom were widely derided by prosecutors, legal analysts and commentators as narcissistic, self-absorbed and even more hurtful to the young men he was convicted of molesting. \n \n Jerry Sandusky's letter expanded on the rambling, 15-minute courtroom soliloquy that touched on everything from the writer Henry David Thoreau to \"special inmate friends\" to wet kisses from dogs. Like that speech, it was part locker room pep talk and part Sunday school inspirational, with a heaping side order of the Frank Sinatra ballad \"My Way.\" \n \n He wrote about life in protective custody, and how it led him to think about all the interests that were being protected as the case unfolded: \"The system protected the system, the media, the prosecution, the civil attorneys and the accusers. Everybody protected themselves,\" he wrote. \n \n \"Penn State, with its own system, protected their public image,\" he continued. \"Media protected their jobs and ambitions. Prosecutors protected their jobs and egos. The accusers were protected and provided access to potential financial gain, free attorneys, accolades, psychologists and attention.\" \n \n McQueary files lawsuit against Penn State \n \n He wrote that he was heartbroken. \n \n \"My trust in people, systems and fairness has diminished,\" he said. \"In my heart I know I did not do these disgusting acts. However, I didn't tell the jury. Our son changed our plans when he switched sides.\" \n \n Matt Sandusky was 18 when he was adopted by the Sanduskys after spending time with them in foster care. The relationship always has been rocky, but it collapsed near the end of Sandusky's trial in June. As the prosecution's case drew to a close, Matt told investigators that Sandusky had molested him, too. \n \n Matt Sandusky, now 33, did not testify for either side, but Jerry Sandusky insists that his adopted son's desertion and potentially damaging testimony kept him from testifying in his own defense. \n \n The Sanduskys spared no one. \n \n \"There were so many people involved in the orchestration of this conviction (media, investigators, prosecutors, \"the system,\" Penn State and the accusers.) It was well done. They won!\" Jerry Sandusky wrote, as if a tragic court case about molested children was an epic gridiron contest. \n \n \"When I thought about how it had transpired, I wondered what they had won,\" he continued. \"I thought of the methods, decisions and allegations. I relived the inconsistencies and dishonest testimonies.\" He pondered what would happen if the tables were turned. \n \n When the hero falls off the pedestal: The emotion of betrayal \n \n \"What would be the outcome if all the accusers and their families who were investigated?\" he wrote. \"I knew the answer. All their issues would surface. They would no longer be these poor, innocent people as portrayed.\" \n \n Dottie Sandusky also wrote of her disappointment, saying she has lost faith in the police and the legal system. \"To think that they can lie and get by with the lies. The press has been unbelievable. People who have not met us are writing untruths.\" \n \n Dottie Sandusky's letter is revealing because she has stood silently by her husband in court. She testified at his trial that she never heard or saw anything strange or sexual going on in the basement of their home, where many of the victims say her husband molested them. \n \n In her letter, she unloaded on her adopted son, Matt. \n \n \"People need to know what kind of person he is,\" she wrote. \"We have forgiven him many times for all he has done to our family, thinking that he was changing his life, but he would always go back to his stealing and lies. He has been diagnose (sic) Bipolar, but he refuses to take his medicine.\" \n \n Records from Centre County's probation department and juvenile courts tell part of the story of how Matt H., as he was known, came to the Sanduskys. \n \n Like the boys who testified against Sandusky at the trial, Matt participated in Sandusky's youth mentoring program, The Second Mile. Jerry Sandusky was in Southern California, preparing for the Rose Bowl, when Matt was arrested in 1995. Sandusky called personally and pulled strings to make sure Matt was placed under his care and not sent to juvenile detention. \n \n Opinion: For the victims, it's about more than locking him up \n \n The court documents detail Matt's continuing troubles, including an aspirin overdose in March 1996 that is characterized as a suicide attempt. But he maintained that he wanted to stay in the Sandusky home, writing to the court, \"I feel that they have supported me even when I have messed up. They are a loving, caring group of people. They have showed me what a family is really like.\" \n \n In another instance, Sandusky called police to his house, claiming a burglar was trying to break in. It was Matt, who said he had come to the house for a power tool. \n \n Matt Sandusky now is represented by a law firm in State College that is handling the cases of several other Sandusky molestation victims. \n \n \"Matt is extremely disappointed that Dottie and the Sanduskys have decided to smear his character in an attempt to deflect attention from Jerry Sandusky's heinous crimes,\" his lawyers Justine Andronici and Andrew Shubin said in a written statement to CNN. \n \n \"Matt has shown tremendous courage and strength,\" the statement continued. \"Rather than supporting her son when he made the gut-wrenching decision to come forward and tell the truth about the abuse he suffered at the hands of Jerry Sandusky, Dottie Sandusky has chosen to continue Jerry's strategy of blaming and attacking the victims, thereby perpetuating the abuse.\" \n \n Dottie Sandusky wrote that her adopted son \"has had many run-ins with the law and stolen money and items from our family. We still love him and want the best for him, but because of his actions we cannot express this to him. ...\" \n \n Karl Rominger, a lawyer for Sandusky, did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for the State Attorney General's office said prosecutors \"stand by\" what they said Tuesday about Sandusky's victim and system bashing. \n \n The lead prosecutor, Joseph McGettigan, described Sandusky's behavior as \"banal, self-delusional, completely untethered from reality. It was entirely-self-focused, as if he himself were the victim.\" \n \n Jerry Sandusky trial: All you need to know about allegations, how case unfolded ||||| Seeing is believing \n \n The home of over 5.1 million full archive pages of The Philadelphia Inquirer and Philadelphia Daily News print editions \n \n Search and browse our historical collection to find news, notices of births, marriages and deaths, sports, comics, and much more \n \n Dates range from 1860 to today for The Philadelphia Inquirer and 1960 to today for the Philadelphia Daily News",

The two countries have marched under the flag before, in rare shows of unity, first at the 1991 World Table Tennis Championships, and at a number of sporting events since. It was most recently used at the 2006 Winter Games in Turin, Italy \n \n The International Olympics Committee (IOC) would need to approve the countries' agreements, and those that affect competition, such as the joint hockey team, could be more complicated than the ceremonial proposals. \n \n The committee said Wednesday it had received a number of \"interesting proposals\" that it would discuss with delegates from both countries in Switzerland on Saturday. \n \n \"We are sure that the two Korean delegations will present their ideas and proposals at the meeting on Saturday in Lausanne. This will then enable the IOC to carefully evaluate the consequences and the potential impact on the Olympic Games and the Olympic competitions,\" it said in a statement. \n \n Diplomatic thaw \n \n Wednesday's announcement is the latest breakthrough since talks began between the two Koreas earlier this month, after years of broken communications. \n \n While the two sides have earned praise for ratcheting down military tensions in recent weeks, some of Seoul's allies voiced concern Wednesday that Pyongyang may be using the talks to buy time to pursue its weapons program. \n \n The US military has moved more firepower to the region and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned of complacency at a Tuesday summit in Vancouver where the top diplomats from the United States, Japan, Canada and the United Kingdom were in town to discuss North Korea. \n \n Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono called on the international community to be clear-eyed about North Korea's motivations for participating in the talks, which have been hailed by some as the most significant thaw in ties in years. \n \n \"I believe that North Korea wants to buy some time to continue their nuclear and missile programs,\" Kono said at the meeting. \"It's not the time to ease pressure towards North Korea.\" \n \n China denounced the Vancouver talks, and the United Nations Command, under whose framework they are being held, as demonstrating \"Cold War mentality.\" \n \n \"(Such thinking) will only lead to split in the international community and harm the joint efforts that could properly solve the nuclear issue on Korea peninsula,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Wednesday. \n \n JUST WATCHED Talks keep N.

They are carrying yellow signs with slogans including, \"Stop racism now\" and \"Indict, convict, jail.\" A banner says \"Justice 4 Freddie Carlos Gray.\" \n \n They chanted: \"Indict, convict, send those killer cops to jail. The whole damn system is guilty as hell\" and \"Tell the truth and stop the lies, Freddie Gray didn't have to die.\" \n \n Freddie Gray was a black man who died April 19, a week after suffering a critical spinal injury in custody.

Mosby remaining at the helm of the prosecution. \n \n During a day of hearings in a downtown courtroom, Judge Barry Williams swiftly sliced through complex legal arguments in the first motions hearing. In three key rulings issued from the bench, he refused to dismiss the charges or recuse Mosby and decided that the case should be split to ensure that each officer gets a fair trial. \n \n Williams said that trying the officers together would not be \"in the interest of justice\" because key evidence that's admissible with regards to one officer may be inadmissible for another. The officers are charged with a range of offenses, from murder to misconduct, as each played a different role in Gray's arrest and transport. \n \n The case has sparked widespread protests in Baltimore \u2014 which continued Wednesday \u2014 and has become part of a national dialogue about police treatment of black citizens. Gray, 25, died in April one week after suffering a severe spinal cord injury while in police custody. \n \n Outside the courtroom, dozens of protesters gathered in peaceful demonstrations and marches through downtown that resulted in one arrest and snarled traffic. Even at this early stage of the court proceedings, organizers said they wanted their voices heard. \n \n \"It's a step in the right direction,\" Malcolm Wilson said of Williams' rulings on defense motions to recuse Mosby and dismiss the case. The 23-year-old East Baltimore resident, who said he knew Gray, clutched a white cardboard sign that read, \"I am here for Justice for Mr. Gray.\" \n \n Police, who had been criticized for their response to previous demonstrations and rioting, repeatedly ordered protesters to \"remain on the sidewalk\" and quickly responded to one tense moment near the Inner Harbor in which a protester was arrested and an officer suffered minor injuries. \n \n Interim Police Commissioner Kevin Davis said police wanted to treat \"a protest like a protest,\" and that \"by and large, that's exactly what happened.\" Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake praised the department, saying she and police \"will vigorously defend the First Amendment rights of the protesters, but we will also vigorously enforce the order in our city.\" \n \n In the courtroom, filled with legal observers and media after months of sharply written legal filings filled with accusations lobbed between the defense and prosecution, Williams sought to maintain order. \n \n He stopped the proceedings to remind those present to turn off all electronics, warning that he would remove everyone but the attorneys. He frequently interrupted the attorneys during their arguments, to seek clarification on a key point, wryly disagree or keep the attorneys on topic. \n \n The officers had waived their rights to attend Wednesday's hearing, and Gray's family did not attend. \n \n While the oral arguments on the dismissal and recusal motions largely reflected those made in written filings \u2014 which often centered on Mosby's actions \u2014 the arguments over whether to try the officers separately provided new insights into defense and prosecution theories. \n \n Officer Caesar R. Goodson Jr., the driver of the police van in which Gray was injured, is charged with second-degree depraved-heart murder. Sgt. Alicia D. White, Lt. Brian W. Rice and Officer William G. Porter are charged with manslaughter. Officers Edward M. Nero and Garrett E. Miller face lesser charges, including second-degree assault. All six have been charged with misconduct in office. \n \n Partially redacted statements by several of the officers were submitted to the court on Wednesday, though under seal, as were police dispatch tapes. \n \n Prosecutors previously indicated that they wanted to try Goodson, White, Nero and Miller together in one trial, and Porter and Rice together in a second trial. \n \n However, at the hearing Wednesday, they only sought to have Goodson, White and Nero tried together. Deputy State's Attorney Janice Bledsoe argued that much of the evidence in the case was relevant to those three officers. \n \n She said all of the evidence related to what happened to Gray from his arrest to his arrival unresponsive at the Western District police station would be needed to prove reckless endangerment on their part. \n \n But Marc Zayon, Nero's attorney, said Gray's arrest and transport constituted two separate incidents. He said evidence brought to support the felony charges against Goodson and White, including expert witness testimony on Gray's injuries sustained in the van and evidence regarding how Goodson was driving, would be highly prejudicial if introduced in a case against Nero. \n \n Defense attorneys also raised concerns that statements by the officers could incriminate one of the co-defendants, pitting one's right not to take the stand with another's right to confront his or her accuser. \n \n Matthew Fraling, an attorney for Goodson, also said he was concerned about a \"transfer of guilt\" and a \"spillover effect\" in the minds of jurors trying to categorize evidence against different defendants. \n \n In denying the state's motion to join the cases, Williams agreed that much of the evidence would not be \"mutually admissible.\" His ruling means there will be six trials. \n \n Arguments over dismissing the charges and recusing Mosby came after a flurry of heatedly written motions over the past four months. In court Wednesday, Williams cautioned both sides to tone down their rhetoric. \n \n \"The unnecessary name calling and over-the-top rhetoric to which this court has been required to wade in order to get to the heart of the legal issues in this case is remarkable,\" Williams said.",
    "summary": "\u2013 Written motions finally evolved into verbal arguments this morning in Baltimore, where defense attorneys for two of the six officers charged in the arrest and death of Freddie Gray tried to have said charges dismissed and the office of State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby recused from the case\u2014attempts that were both rejected by Judge Barry Williams, the Baltimore Sun reports. The defense attorneys argued, among other things, that Mosby had influenced the jury pool by \"[adopting] and [encouraging] the public's cry of 'no justice, no peace'\" when she publicly announced the charges against the officers in May. Another complaint by the defense: Mosby's judgment was influenced by her husband serving as councilman for a local district that saw a \"disproportionate amount of violence\" in the days after Gray's death, the AP reports. Williams called that assertion \"condescending\" and said while he was \"troubled\" by some of Mosby's comments during her May 1 news conference, the defendants' right to a fair trial wasn't compromised by her statements, per the AP. The hearing is expected to continue this afternoon to determine whether the trial for the six officers should be split up. (In a unrelated story, members of Freddie Gray's family, including Gray himself, were victims of lead poisoning and may have been misled by a settlement company.)",

    "document": "In an open letter, Mira Sorvino has publicly apologized to Dylan Farrow, the estranged daughter of director Woody Allen\u2014and expressed regret about working with the controversial filmmaker. Sorvino won an Oscar for her performance in his 1995 film, Mighty Aphrodite, but has since re-examined her decision to work with Allen due to Farrow\u2019s accusations. (Farrow has repeatedly accused Allen of abusing her as a child; Allen denies the allegations.) Sorvino was prompted to speak out after she alleged to reporter Ronan Farrow, who is Dylan\u2019s brother, that Harvey Weinstein (who produced Mighty Aphrodite) harassed her years ago. \n \n \u201cI confess that at the time I worked for Woody Allen I was a na\u00efve young actress,\u201d Sorvino wrote in an essay for HuffPost. \u201cI swallowed the media\u2019s portrayal of your abuse allegations against your father as an outgrowth of a twisted custody battle between Mia Farrow and him, and did not look further into the situation, for which I am terribly sorry.\u201d \n \n Sorvino stated clearly that her relationship with Allen on the film was \u201cfriendly, though not close, but in no way did he ever overstep his bounds with me.\u201d \n \n \u201cI never personally experienced what has now been described as inappropriate behavior toward young girls,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this does not excuse my turning a blind eye to your story simply because I wanted desperately for it not to be so.\u201d \n \n The actress writes that she spoke with Ronan in December, telling about the \u201caftermath\u201d of sharing her Weinstein story. In her accusations against Weinstein, she said that he essentially blacklisted her from landing plum movie roles after her Mighty Aphrodite success, because she reportedly rebuffed him when he sexually harassed her and tried to pressure her into a physical relationship. (Weinstein denied the claims.) Her blacklisting allegations have been supported by directors like Peter Jackson and Terry Zwigoff; representatives for Weinstein released statements denying the claims from both directors. \n \n She also told Ronan that she wanted to learn more about Dylan\u2019s accusations, and he pointed her toward \u201cpublicly available details of the case I had ruefully never known of, which made me begin to feel the evidence strongly supported your story.\u201d \n \n \u201cI am sorry it has taken me a few weeks to come out in support of you since that conversation, but it has been a process for me to own this truth and make this irrevocable break,\u201d she writes. \n \n Sorvino is now the third actress to acknowledge Dylan Farrow and publicly distance herself from Woody Allen. Ellen Page, who starred in the 2012 Allen film To Rome with Love, kicked off the trend in November with a lengthy Facebook post. \n \n \u201cI did a Woody Allen movie and it is the biggest regret of my career,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI am ashamed I did this. I had yet to find my voice and was not who I am now and felt pressured, because \u2018of course you have to say yes to this Woody Allen film.\u2019 Ultimately, however, it is my choice what films I decide to do and I made the wrong choice. I made an awful mistake.\u201d \n \n Greta Gerwig was the next to join this group, telling The New York Times that she will never work with Allen again. \n \n \u201cDylan Farrow\u2019s two different pieces made me realize that I increased another woman\u2019s pain, and I was heartbroken by that realization,\u201d Gerwig said. \u201cI grew up on his movies, and they have informed me as an artist, and I cannot change that fact now, but I can make different decisions moving forward.\u201d \n \n Get Vanity Fair\u2019s HWD Newsletter Sign up for essential industry and award news from Hollywood. E-mail Address Subscribe ||||| Photo: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images \n \n Mira Sorvino, who starred in Woody Allen\u2019s 1995 comedy Mighty Aphrodite, wrote an open letter in the Huffington Post voicing her support for Dylan Farrow, Allen\u2019s estranged adopted daughter who has accused him of sexual abuse. In the letter Sorvino writes that she regrets letting her admiration for the filmmaker\u2019s work to influence her willingness to overlook Farrows claims for many years. \n \n Sorvino addressed Farrow directly, writing: \n \n I never personally experienced what has now been described as inappropriate behavior toward young girls. But this does not excuse my turning a blind eye to your story simply because I wanted desperately for it not to be so. \n \n It is difficult to sever ties and denounce your heroes, your benefactors, whom you fondly admired and felt a debt of gratitude toward for your entire career\u2019s existence. To decide, although they may be fantastically talented and helped you enormously, that you believe they have done things for which there can be no excuse. But that is where we stand today. \n \n In 1992, Dylan was 7 years old when she reportedly told her mother, Mia Farrow, that she was inappropriately sexually touched by Allen, Farrow\u2019s partner of 12 years. Though Allen has denied the allegations and was not criminally charged, a judge granted Mia Farrow full custody after finding Dylan\u2019s testimony credible in 1993. Dylan has maintained her allegations in recent essays. \n \n Sorvino explains in her letter that she had \u201ccherished\u201d Allen\u2019s written work when she was a child and describes herself as being \u201cin awe\u201d of his films. She remembers herself in the mid \u201890s as a \u201cna\u00efve young actress\u201d who accepted \u201cthe media\u2019s portrayal of [Dylan\u2019s] abuse allegations against [her] father as an outgrowth of a twisted custody battle between Mia Farrow and him.\u201d \n \n In the past year, Sorvino spoke to journalist Ronan Farrow, Dylan\u2019s brother, on the record about her experience being sexually harassed by Harvey Weinstein. Her allegations appeared in Ronan\u2019s bombshell New Yorker expos\u00e9. In Sorvino\u2019s letter she says that it was her experience with coming forward that made her to want to finally read more about Dylan\u2019s experience. \n \n \u201cI send you love and inclusion and admiration for your courage all this time. I believe you!!!\u201d Sorvino wrote to Farrow. She added that she had no intention of defending Allen moving forward: \n \n Even if you love someone, if you learn they may have committed these despicable acts, they must be exposed and condemned, and this exposure must have consequences. I will never work with him again. \n \n In the past week, two other actors who worked with Allen, Greta Gerwig (To Rome With Love) and David Krumholtz (Wonder Wheel) have also expressed regret for working with the director. ||||| Dear Dylan, \n \n Hello. I apologize for this being the first time I address you in print, what will be the first of several apologies today. I am writing to express my belief in and support of you. \n \n I confess that at the time I worked for Woody Allen I was a naive young actress. I swallowed the media\u2019s portrayal of your abuse allegations against your father as an outgrowth of a twisted custody battle between Mia Farrow and him, and did not look further into the situation, for which I am terribly sorry. For this I also owe an apology to Mia. \n \n What I have to say next is not a justification, simply a description of my background with Woody at that time and since. As an adolescent, I cherished my copy of his book \u201cWithout Feathers.\u201d I played the Diane Keaton role in a high school production of \u201cPlay It Again, Sam\u201d and had grown up, like so many in my generation, in awe of his films. As a young actress I landed the dream role of Linda Ash in \u201cMighty Aphrodite,\u201d and the artistic license he allowed me to create the character was thrilling. We were friendly though not close, but in no way did he ever overstep his bounds with me; I never personally experienced what has now been described as inappropriate behavior toward young girls. But this does not excuse my turning a blind eye to your story simply because I wanted desperately for it not to be so. \n \n It is difficult to sever ties and denounce your heroes, your benefactors, whom you fondly admired and felt a debt of gratitude toward for your entire career\u2019s existence. To decide, although they may be fantastically talented and helped you enormously, that you believe they have done things for which there can be no excuse. But that is where we stand today. \n \n In December I called your brother Ronan, sharing about the aftermath of my and other women\u2019s coming forward about Harvey Weinstein. How it had been a sometimes empowering, sometimes bitter and heartbreaking experience, as more and more details came out of hidden damage this man had done me. Of how I felt somehow more vulnerable and triggered (though certainly grateful) when millions of people showed me their support online, as though now my life had been reduced to one victimization... I told him I wanted to learn more about you and your situation. He pointed me toward publicly available details of the case I had ruefully never known of, which made me begin to feel the evidence strongly supported your story. That you have been telling the truth all along. \n \n I am so sorry, Dylan! I cannot begin to imagine how you have felt, all these years as you watched someone you called out as having hurt you as a child, a vulnerable little girl in his care, be lauded again and again, including by me and countless others in Hollywood who praised him and ignored you. As a mother and a woman, this breaks my heart for you. I am so, so sorry! \n \n We are in a day and age when everything must be re-examined. This kind of abuse cannot be allowed to continue. If this means tearing down all the old gods, so be it. The cognitive dissonance, the denial and cowardice that spare us painful truths and prevent us from acting in defense of innocent victims while allowing \u201cbeloved\u201d individuals to continue their heinous behavior must be jettisoned from the bottom of our souls. Even if you love someone, if you learn they may have committed these despicable acts, they must be exposed and condemned, and this exposure must have consequences. I will never work with him again. \n \n I am sorry it has taken me a few weeks to come out in support of you since that conversation, but it has been a process for me to own this truth and make this irrevocable break. \n \n I send you love and inclusion and admiration for your courage all this time. I believe you!!! I am grateful to you and admire your integrity and bravery, one woman who has had to stand virtually alone all these years speaking her painful truth. You are a true hero, and I stand with you. \n \n In gratitude and solidarity, \n \n Mira Sorvino",
    "summary": "\u2013 \"I believe you!!!\" Mira Sorvino writes in an open letter to Dylan Farrow published by the HuffPost. The actor reached out to Woody Allen's daughter Wednesday to apologize for starring in her father's Mighty Aphrodite\u2014for which she won an Oscar\u2014while ignoring Farrow's claims of sexual abuse against Allen. Farrow was 7 when she said Allen sexually touched her, and a judge later found her claims credible, though Allen has continually denied the allegations, Vulture reports. Sorvino says she was aware of Farrow's claims when she made Mighty Aphrodite but dismissed them \"as an outgrowth of a twisted custody battle\" because of her lifelong love of Allen's work. \"It is difficult to sever ties and denounce your heroes, your benefactors, whom you fondly admired and felt a debt of gratitude toward for your entire career\u2019s existence,\" she writes. Sorvino says her experience opening up to Farrow's brother, reporter Ronan Farrow, about Harvey Weinstein made her want to learn more about Dylan Farrow's allegations, which led to her taking those allegations seriously. Sorvino says her love of Allen's work \"does not excuse my turning a blind eye to your story simply because I wanted desperately for it not to be so.\" She says she won't work with Allen again, writing: \"We are in a day and age when everything must be re-examined. This kind of abuse cannot be allowed to continue. If this means tearing down all the old gods, so be it.\" Sorvino isn't the first actor to denounce Allen. Greta Gerwig and David Krumholtz recently said they regret working with him. And Vanity Fair reports Ellen Page in November called doing an Allen movie \"the biggest regret of my career.\"",

(Associated Press) \n \n The Democratic Progressive Party's Tsai was poised to become the self-governing island's first female president in an election taking place amid concerns that the island's economy is under threat from China and broad opposition to Beijing's demands for political unification. \n \n Tsai had about 60 percent of votes while Nationalist Eric Chu had about 30 percent, with about half of votes counted. \n \n \"We failed. The Nationalist Party lost the elections. We didn't work hard enough,\" Chu said before a thin crowd of a few hundred supporters at his campaign headquarters. He followed his concession speech by making a long bow. \n \n \"As the Nationalist Party chairperson, I need to pay the highest level of responsibility. Dear all friends, Eric Chu apologizes to everyone. I'm resigning as party chief,\" he said. \n \n Outgoing Nationalist President Ma Ying-jeou has served eight years and is constitutionally barred from another term. \n \n The outcome of the contest for a majority in the 113-seat legislature remained uncertain, with independents and smaller parties posing a threat to both the Nationalists and the DPP. \n \n \"Taiwan and China need to keep some distance,\" said Willie Yao, a computer engineer voting in Taipei who said he backed Tsai. \"The change of president would mean still letting Taiwanese make the decision.\" \n \n Reflecting unease over a slowdown in Taiwan's once-mighty economy, undeclared voter Hsieh Lee-fung said providing opportunities to the next generation was the most important issue. \n \n \"Economic progress is related closely to our leadership, like land reform and housing prices. People aren't making enough money to afford homes,\" Hsieh said. \n \n A win for Tsai would introduce new uncertainty in the complicated relationship between Taiwan and mainland China, which claims the island as its own territory and threatens to use force if it declares formal independence. \n \n \"This is not about defeating the other party. This is about working to overcome the obstacles in Taiwan's path,\" Tsai told supporters in the rain at a final rally Friday night in front of the presidential office building in the center of the capital, Taipei. \n \n Tsai has pledged to maintain the status quo of de-facto independence for the island of 23 million, although she has refused to endorse the principle that Taiwan and China are parts of a single nation to be unified eventually. \n \n Beijing has made that its baseline for continuing negotiations that have produced a series of pacts on trade, transport and exchanges. Observers say China is likely to adopt a wait-and-see approach to Tsai's presidency, but might use diplomatic and economy pressure if she is seen as straying too far from its unification agenda. \n \n Taiwan was a Japanese colony from 1885 to 1945 and split again from China amid civil war in 1949. \n \n Chu was a late entry in the race after the party ditched its original candidate, Hung Hsiu-chu, whose abrasive style was seen as alienating voters. \n \n China has largely declined to comment on the polls, although its chief official for Taiwan affairs this month warned of potential major challenges in the relationship in the year ahead. \n \n Tsai supporters appeared confident that ties with China would weather a change in government. \n \n \"As long as Tsai doesn't provoke the other side, it's OK,\" said former newspaper distribution agent Lenex Chang, who attended Tsai's rally. \"If mainland China democratizes someday, we could consider a tie-up,\" he added. \n \n Candidates from across the political spectrum sounded a rare note of unity Saturday after a teenage pop star posted a video online apologizing for having waved the Taiwanese flag on a South Korean TV program. \n \n Sixteen-year-old Chou Tzu-yu, who performs under the name Tzuyu, had apparently been compelled to apologize after her South Korean management company suspended her activities in China for fear of offending nationalist sentiments on the mainland. \n \n Ma, Tsai and Chu all condemned what they described as the bullying of a young girl. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writer Ralph Jennings contributed to this report. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Tsai Ing-wen said people in Taiwan wanted a transparent government \n \n Tsai Ing-wen has been elected Taiwan's first female president. \n \n Ms Tsai, 59, leads the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) that wants independence from China. \n \n In her victory speech, she vowed to preserve the status quo in relations with China, adding Beijing must respect Taiwan's democracy and both sides must ensure there are no provocations. \n \n China sees the island as a breakaway province - which it has threatened to take back by force if necessary. \n \n In her speech, Ms Tsai hailed a \"new era\" in Taiwan and pledged to co-operate with other political parties on major issues. \n \n The will of the Taiwanese people would be the basis for relations with China, Ms Tsai said. \n \n \"I also want to emphasise that both sides of the Taiwanese Strait have a responsibility to find mutually acceptable means of interaction that are based on dignity and reciprocity. \n \n \"We must ensure that no provocations or accidents take place,\" Ms Tsai said, warning that \"any forms of suppression will harm the stability of cross-strait relations\". \n \n She thanked the US and Japan for their support and vowed Taiwan would contribute to peace and stability in the region. \n \n Ms Tsai had a commanding lead in the vote count when Eric Chu of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) admitted defeat. \n \n Mr Chu congratulated Tsai Ing-wen and announced he was quitting as KMT head. Taiwan's Premier Mao Chi-kuo also resigned. \n \n Read more about Taiwan's election \n \n Image copyright EPA \n \n Taiwan's first female leader, shy but steely \n \n Why does this election matter? \n \n Who is running? \n \n Is it all about the economy? \n \n What's behind the China-Taiwan divide? \n \n Taiwan profile \n \n The election came just months after a historic meeting between the leaders of Taiwan and China. \n \n However, the flagging economy as well as Taiwan's relationship with China both played a role in the voters' choice, correspondents say. \n \n The KMT has been in power for most of the past 70 years and has overseen improved relations with Beijing - Ms Tsai's is only the second-ever victory for the DPP. \n \n The first was by pro-independence advocate Chen Shui-bian; during his time as president between 2000 and 2008 tensions with China escalated. \n \n Analysis: Cindy Sui, BBC News, Taipei \n \n The victory by Tsai Ing-wen marks a defeat for not only the pro-unification ruling party KMT but also China. \n \n Despite the past eight years of reduced tensions and much improved relations built by the KMT and China, Taiwanese voters have voted for Ms Tsai from the pro-independence party instead. Basically, they've voted to keep Beijing at a distance. \n \n This reflects not only widespread dissatisfaction with President Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT over insufficient measures to improve the lacklustre economy, low wages and widening wealth gap - it also reflects growing worries by Taiwanese people that the island may become too economically dependent on China and that this will make it hard for Taiwan to fend off pressures by Beijing to reunify with it one day. \n \n The message voters have sent Beijing is that, while they want reduced tensions and good relations, they cherish Taiwan's sovereignty, democracy and self-rule even more. \n \n The challenge now is for Ms Tsai to find a way to work with China, the island's biggest export market, trade partner and security threat. \n \n Ms Tsai, a former scholar, has said she wants to \"maintain [the] status quo\" with China. \n \n She became chairwoman of the DPP in 2008, after it saw a string of corruption scandals. \n \n She lost a presidential bid in 2012 but has subsequently led the party to regional election victories. She has won increased support from the public partly because of widespread dissatisfaction over the KMT and President Ma Ying-jeou's handling of the economy and widening wealth gap. \n \n Image copyright AP Image caption Eric Chu's loss shows the KMT has lost a nearly 70-year monopoly on power \n \n Saturday's polls come after a historic meeting between President Ma and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Singapore in November for talks that were seen as largely symbolic - the first in more than 60 years. \n \n Eric Chu, 54, is the mayor of New Taipei City and stepped up to become chairman of the party in October. \n \n The KMT has lost its majority in the legislature for the first time in history. \n \n The former accounting professor was seen as popular with young people in the party, but had been unable to change public opinion that is increasingly unhappy with the party's friendly stance towards China and the island's economic travails. \n \n In 2014, hundreds of students occupied the parliament in the largest show of anti-China sentiment on the island for years. Labelled the Sunflower Movement, protesters demanded more transparency in trade pacts negotiated with China. \n \n Taiwan for all practical purposes been independent since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, when the defeated Nationalist government fled to the island as the Communists, under Mao Zedong, swept to power.",
    "summary": "\u2013 Tsai Ing-wen promised a \"new era\" for Taiwan on Saturday after being elected as the island's first female president. The 59-year-old, from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, defeated the Nationalist Party's Eric Chu with around 60% of the vote, reports the Los Angeles Times. Tsai will take office in May. Nationalist President Ma Ying-jeou has already served two terms and Taiwan's constitution didn't allow him to seek a third, the AP notes. \"We failed. The Nationalist Party lost the elections. We didn't work hard enough,\" Chu told supporters at party headquarters, announcing his resignation as party chief. The election marks what the BBC calls a \"turning point in Taiwan's democracy and relationship with China,\" which still officially considers the island to be a renegade province. \"I am very happy. I feel I have finally accomplished something for Taiwan, so that Taiwan will have great autonomy instead of just following China,\" a 32-year-old engineer who voted for Tsai tells the LAT. Tsai has said she favors maintaining the status quo, though her refusal to support the principle of reunification between China and Taiwan makes it uncertain whether the closer ties with Beijing that Ma introduced will continue, reports the AP.",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n / Updated By Sarah Fitzpatrick, Tracy Connor, Tom Winter and Ben Collins \n \n Stormy Daniels' attorney claimed Tuesday that President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen received $500,000 from a company controlled by a Russian oligarch, deposited into an account for a company also used to pay off the adult film actress. \n \n Daniels' attorney, Michael Avenatti, also detailed other transactions he said were suspicious, including deposits from drug giant Novartis, the state-run Korea Aerospace Industries, and AT&T. \n \n Novartis confirmed it had paid Cohen's company, Essential Consultants, and said Special Counsel Robert Mueller had inquired about the arrangement in November. AT&T also confirmed it paid Cohen's company, for \"insights\" into the Trump administration. \n \n Avenatti's claims, made in a dossier posted to Twitter, could suggest a new dimension to the federal investigation into Cohen. NBC News has reviewed financial documents that appear to support Avenatti\u2019s account of the transactions. \n \n \"This thing is a pig and they can try to put lipstick on a pig \u2014 tonight, next week, next month \u2014 but it's still gonna be a pig,\" Avenatti said on MSNBC's \"The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell.\" \n \n \"This thing's ugly and it's gonna get worse.\" \n \n Cohen disputed Avenatti's accounting but provided no details. \n \n \"His document is inaccurate,\" he said as he left a Manhattan hotel and got into a cab Wednesday morning. \n \n Avenatti said his investigation uncovered that $4.4 million flowed through a First Republic account linked to Essential Consultants between October 2016 and January 2018. Essential Consultants is the company Cohen created before the 2016 election and then used to wire $130,000 to Daniels to stop her from going public with her account of an alleged sexual affair with Trump a decade ago. \n \n In particular, Avenatti identified eight transactions between January and August 2017, totaling half a million dollars, from U.S.-based Columbus Nova, which he said is controlled by Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg and Vekselberg's cousin Andrew Intrater. \n \n In a statement, an attorney for Columbus Nova said the management firm is owned and controlled by Americans and not Vekselberg, who is the president of the Russian conglomerate Renovo Group. \n \n \"After the inauguration, the firm hired Michael Cohen as a business consultant regarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures,\" the Columbus Nova statement said. \n \n \"Reports today that Viktor Vekselberg used Columbus Nova as a conduit for payments to Michael Cohen are false. The claim that Viktor Vekselberg was involved or provided any funding for Columbus Nova's engagement of Michael Cohen is patently untrue. \n \n \"Neither Viktor Vekselberg nor anyone else other than Columbus Nova's owners, were involved in the decision to hire Cohen or provided funding for his engagement.\" \n \n This thing is a pig and they can try to put lipstick on a pig \u2014 tonight, next week, next month \u2014 but it's still gonna be a pig. \n \n Columbus Nova was listed on the website of the Renova Group as one of its \"companies\" until November 2017. Renova's website is now listed as \"under construction,\" but older versions remain on The Wayback Machine, which creates archives of sites across the web. \n \n In a statement, Columbus Nova's attorney said the firm \"has managed assets on behalf of Renova Group companies and other clients. Columbus Nova itself is not now, and has never been, owned by any foreign entity or person including Viktor Vekselberg or the Renova Group.\" \n \n A review of public election filings shows that the CEO of Columbus Nova, Andrew Intrater, made several political donations over the past two years. \n \n According to public record filings he donated $29,600 to the Republican National Committee in June 2017, $35,000 to the Trump Victory PAC the same month, and then $250,000 to the Trump Inauguration Fund. Columbus Nova has also registered many alt-right internet domains, though the domains return an error message. \n \n Russian President Vladimir Putin meets with Renova Group Board Chairman and Skolkovo Foundation President Viktor Vekselberg at the Kremlin in Moscow on March 14, 2017.

He noted reports that said Trump met with Novartis' CEO in January 2018. In a statement, Novartis said it had a one-year agreement with Essential Consultants, \"focused on U.S. healthcare policy matters,\" that expired in February. It was contacted in November by Mueller's office and \"cooperated fully,\" it said. \n \n AT&T made four payments of $50,000 each to Essential in late 2017 and early 2018. In a statement, AT&T said it engaged the firm in early 2017 to \"provide insights into understanding the new administration. They did no legal or lobbying work for us, and the contract ended in December 2017.\u201d \n \n Korea Aerospace Industries made a $150,000 payment to Essential in November 2017.

Avenatti says he has information showing that... (Associated Press) \n \n WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Stormy Daniels' lawyer said Tuesday he has information showing that Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's longtime personal attorney, received $500,000 from a company associated with a Russian billionaire within months of paying hush money to Daniels, a porn star who claims she had an affair with Trump. \n \n Lawyer Michael Avenatti also said hundreds of thousands of dollars streamed into Cohen's account from companies, including pharmaceutical giant Novartis, AT&T and Korea Aerospace, with U.S. government business interests. AT&T confirmed its connection Tuesday evening. \n \n Avenatti did not reveal the source of his information or release documentation. But in a seven-page memo, Avenatti detailed what he said were wire transfers going into and out of the account Cohen used to pay Daniels $130,000 in October 2016 to stay silent about her alleged affair with the soon-to-be president. Trump denies having an affair with Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. \n \n Financial documents reviewed Tuesday by The Associated Press appeared to back up Avenatti's report. \n \n The memo, containing highly specific dates and amounts, stated that Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian billionaire, and his cousin \"routed\" eight payments totaling approximately $500,000 to Cohen's company, Essential Consultants, between January and August 2017. The reason for the payment was not known. \n \n Speculating without offering proof, the Avenatti memo said, \"It appears these funds may have replenished the account following the payment to Ms. Clifford.\" \n \n Avenatti's memo said the deposits into the account controlled by Cohen were made by Columbus Nova, an American investment company affiliated with the Renova Group, which is controlled by Vekselberg. \n \n Columbus Nova's attorney Richard Owens stressed in a statement that the company is \"solely owned and controlled by Americans\" and said that, after Trump's inauguration, the firm hired Cohen as a business consultant \"regarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures,\" but that it had nothing to do with Vekselberg. \n \n Owens said any suggestion that Vekselberg used Columbus Nova as a conduit for payments to Cohen was false. \"Neither Viktor Vekselberg nor anyone else, other than Columbus Nova's owners, were involved in the decision to hire Cohen or provided funding for his engagement,\" he said. \n \n Cohen and his attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Cohen is currently under investigation by federal prosecutors in New York, but hasn't been charged. \n \n At the time of the payments, there was an active FBI counterintelligence investigation \u2014 which special counsel Robert Mueller took over last May \u2014 into Russian election interference and any possible coordination with Trump associates. \n \n Vekselberg was targeted for U.S. sanctions by the Trump administration last month. He built his fortune, currently estimated by Forbes at $14.6 billion, by investing in the aluminum and oil industries. More recently, he has expanded his assets to include industrial equipment and high technology. \n \n Offering confirmation for more of the payments, AT&T said in a statement that Essential Consultants was one of several firms it \"engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration.\" \n \n Avenatti alleged that the company made four $50,000 payments to Cohen totaling $200,000 in late 2017 and early 2018. \n \n AT&T said Cohen's company \"did no legal or lobbying work for us, and the contract ended in December 2017.\" Cohen is not a registered lobbyist, according to public records. \n \n Such a confidential relationship would not violate federal lobbying laws if Cohen did not seek to influence Trump on the companies' behalf. But hiring the president's personal attorney for advice on how to woo Trump would be highly unusual, especially given that Cohen was never formally involved in the campaign or Trump's administration. \n \n Making the arrangement even stranger, the blue-chip companies' payments to Cohen were routed to Essential Consultants LLC \u2014 the same company Cohen used to buy Stormy Daniels' silence about her alleged affair with the President. \n \n Trump's Justice Department has sued to block AT&T from an $85 billion merger with Time Warner, saying it would hurt competition and consumers would have to pay more to watch their favorite shows. \n \n Korea Aerospace, which is alleged to have paid Cohen $150,000 in November 2017, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Novartis, a multinational pharmaceutical company, could not confirm or deny the payment, but said any agreements with Essential Consultants were entered before the company's current CEO took over in February of this year and have since expired. \n \n The memo alleges the company paid Cohen $399,920 in late 2017 and early 2018 in four payments \u2014 each amounting to $99,980. \n \n Trump had dinner with Novartis' soon-to-be CEO Vasant Narasimhan, along with other European executives, at the World Economic Forum in Davos shortly after the date of the final payment. \n \n Larry Noble, senior director of the Campaign Legal Center, said there's nothing technically wrong with companies like Novartis and AT&T hiring people like Cohen to provide insight into the president's thinking. But he said the arrangement described by Avenatti \"certainly doesn't look good.\" \n \n \"Why would you go to the president's private fixer?\" he asked. \"He's not known for policy and he's not in the administration. You're going to someone who can get you access and tell you about the person of the president. That's unusual.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Chad Day and Jeff Horwitz in Washington, Jake Pearson in New York and Mike Balsamo in Los Angeles contributed to this report. ||||| (CNN) Special counsel Robert Mueller 's investigators have questioned a Russian oligarch about hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments his company's US affiliate made to President Donald Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, after the election, according to a source familiar with the matter. \n \n Viktor Vekselberg, chairman of asset manager Renova Group, is an oligarch close to Vladimir Putin, and last month the Trump administration placed him on a list of sanctioned Russians for activities including election interference. The purpose of the payments, which predate the sanctions, and the nature of the business relationship between Vekselberg and Cohen is unclear. \n \n The scrutiny of the payments could add to the legal troubles for Cohen, whose home and office were raided last month as part of a criminal investigation by federal prosecutors in Manhattan. In court documents, the prosecutors said at least part of their inquiry stemmed from a referral from Mueller's office. \n \n The questions asked of Vekselberg suggest that Mueller investigators have been examining some of Cohen's business relationships as part of the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Vekselberg is one of two Russian oligarchs the FBI stopped earlier this year after their private jets landed in New York-area airports as part of Mueller's investigation. \n \n Investigators also asked Vekselberg about donations the head of his US affiliate made to Trump's inaugural fund and campaign funds, sources said. \n \n The attorney for Stormy Daniels -- the porn star who received $130,000 to keep quiet about an alleged affair she had with Trump a decade ago -- produced information Tuesday evening that appears to add further details to CNN's reporting. Michael Avenatti alleged that Cohen received half a million dollars from a company affiliated with Vekselberg in the months after the presidential election. \n \n Avenatti alleged the $500,000 went into the bank account for Essential Consultants, a shell company that Cohen set up before the election that was used to pay Daniels. Avenatti added that the payments occurred from January to August 2017. \n \n CNN has reviewed documents that appear to show these payments. CNN has not independently authenticated the documents. \n \n Prosecutors have not accused Cohen of wrongdoing in regard to the payments or any other business dealings. \n \n What FBI agents wanted to know \n \n FBI agents asked Vekselberg about payments his company's American affiliate, Columbus Nova, made to Cohen, according to one source. The Russian was questioned as well about $300,000 in political donations by Andrew Intrater, Vekselberg's American cousin who is the head of Columbus Nova, sources said. \n \n Intrater was also questioned by Mueller's investigators, two sources told CNN. Last month, Vekselberg was placed on the US government's list of sanctioned individuals, prohibiting him from traveling to the US. \n \n The payments occurred at the same time Cohen was trying to build a consulting and legal business after the election and around the time he left the Trump Organization. At that time, he was still Trump's personal lawyer. Even last month, as Trump responded to questions about the payment to Daniels, the President deferred to Cohen and said, \"Michael is my attorney.\" \n \n In court filings, Cohen's attorney said that Cohen has seven clients for whom he provides \"strategic advice and business consulting.\" The attorney did not specify whether Columbus Nova was one of those clients. \n \n After publication, Columbus Nova provided a statement from its attorney, Richard Owens. \n \n \"Columbus Nova is a management company solely owned and controlled by Americans,\" the statement said. \"After the inauguration, the firm hired Michael Cohen as a business consultant regarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures. Reports today that Viktor Vekselberg used Columbus Nova as a conduit for payments to Michael Cohen are false. The claim that Viktor Vekselberg was involved or provided any funding for Columbus Nova's engagement of Michael Cohen is patently untrue. Neither Viktor Vekselberg nor anyone else other than Columbus Nova's owners, were involved in the decision to hire Cohen or provided funding for his engagement.\" \n \n Later Tuesday, Eric Kosta, general counsel of Columbus Nova, sent this statement: \"As the General Counsel of Columbus Nova, I can confirm that the company is 100% owned and controlled by Americans. Any suggestion that at any point in time Viktor Vekselberg or any of his companies owned or exercised any control over Columbus Nova is patently untrue.\" \n \n Intrater did not respond to requests for comment. An attorney for Vekselberg did not respond to a request for comment, nor did representatives for his company in Russia. Cohen did not respond to a request for comment. \n \n Prosecutors with the US attorney's office in Manhattan are investigating Cohen's personal financial dealings, including his taxi business and payments made to silence Daniels, sources have told CNN. The FBI raided Cohen's home, office and hotel room last month, seizing at least eight boxes of documents and more than a dozen electronic devices. Cohen's attorney said the inquiry was referred by Mueller's team. \n \n Campaign donations under scrutiny \n \n Vekselberg's cousin Intrater gave generously to support Trump. \n \n He donated $250,000 to the Trump inauguration fund, $35,000 to the Trump Victory Fund, and $29,600 to the Republican National Committee in June 2017, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. \n \n While it is illegal for foreigners to donate to US politics, Intrater is American. \n \n However, the donations were a sharp increase from previous cycles and may raise questions for investigators. Intrater's only previous political donations included $1,200 to Democrat Bill Richardson's presidential run in 2008 and $2,600 in 2014 for Republican Chris Day's congressional race in New York. Renova Group donated between $50,000 and $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation, but it's not clear when the contribution occurred, according to the foundation's public list of donors. \n \n Vekselberg may also be of interest to investigators because of his close ties to the Kremlin. He built his fortune following the collapse of the Soviet Union through a series of deals in the oil and gas sector. In 2004, he paid over $100 million to buy nine Faberge eggs from the American Forbes family, returning the second-largest collection of imperial eggs to Russia. Six years later, he was appointed by then-Russian president Dmitry Medvedev to lead the Skolkovo Innovation Center project, the Kremlin's answer to Silicon Valley. \n \n From 2007 until March 2012, Vekselberg was a shareholder and chairman of the board of Rusal, the aluminum company controlled by Oleg Deripaska. Deripaska has business ties to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who has been indicted on fraud and tax related charges as part of Mueller's investigation. Manafort has pleaded not guilty. Deripaska, who also was added to the US sanctions list last month, has sued Manafort over a soured investment deal. \n \n Lamesa Investments Ltd, an affiliate of Renova, acquired a large stake in the Bank of Cyprus at the same time Wilbur Ross, then a private equity investor, made a capital infusion into the then-struggling bank. Lamesa now holds a 9.2% stake in the Bank of Cyprus. Ross resigned from his position as vice chairman of the bank after he was confirmed as Trump's commerce secretary. \n \n Vekselberg also attended the December 2015 dinner in Moscow for RT, the state-controlled television channel, where Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, sat beside Putin, according to NBC News. Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying about a call he had with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition and is cooperating with the Mueller investigation. \n \n Update: This story has been updated to include Columbus Nova's latest statement. ||||| Michael Cohen, a longtime lawyer for President Trump, was reportedly hired last year by the U.S.-based affiliate of a Russian billionaire with close ties to Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin. (Seth Wenig/AP) \n \n President Trump\u2019s personal attorney Michael Cohen was hired last year by the U.S.-based affiliate of a Russian business magnate who attended Trump\u2019s inauguration and was recently subjected to sanctions by the U.S. government, the company said Tuesday. \n \n The New York investment firm Columbus Nova said it retained Cohen as a consultant \u201cregarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures.\u201d Though Columbus Nova has been described in federal regulatory filings as an affiliate of the Renova Group, founded by Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg, the company said Vekselberg was not involved with hiring or paying Cohen. \n \n The company\u2019s confirmation came after Michael Avenatti, a lawyer for adult-film actress Stormy Daniels, circulated on Twitter a document purporting to show a detailed accounting of wire transfers made to Essential Consultants, a company established by Cohen in October 2016. \n \n The payments listed in the document began in the months after Cohen paid $130,000 to Daniels just before the November 2016 election, as part of an agreement that required her to not speak publicly about an affair she says she had with Trump a decade earlier. \n \n In the document, Avenatti claims that Cohen received $500,000 from Columbus Nova between January 2017 and August 2017. \n \n Avenatti did not provide supporting documentation for his claims, though Columbus Nova and AT&T;, another company named in the document, both released statements in the hours after Avenatti\u2019s disclosure confirming that they had business relationships with Cohen. \n \n Avenatti alleged that Vekselberg might have provided funds that \u201creplenished the account\u201d following Cohen\u2019s payments to Daniels. In a statement, a spokesman for Vekselberg said neither the Russian billionaire nor the Renova Group has any \u201ccontractual relationship\u201d with Cohen. \n \n [Analysis: How money flowed through Michael Cohen\u2019s multipurpose shell company] \n \n The payments from Columbus Nova point to a potential new financial tie between the president\u2019s personal lawyer and a U.S. representative of a key Russian figure. Vekselberg, who is close to Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin, was one of two dozen Russian business executives and government officials sanctioned in April as part of the U.S. response to the poisoning of a former Russian intelligence officer in southern England. \n \n Columbus Nova hired Cohen as U.S. investigators were ramping up their inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The chief executive of the U.S. affiliate is Vekselberg\u2019s cousin, Andrew Intrater, a U.S. citizen who donated $250,000 to Trump\u2019s inauguration and made additional contributions to a Trump campaign committee and to the Republican National Committee. \n \n More broadly, the revelations show that companies with business interests before the U.S. government hired Cohen, a longtime Trump associate, by paying him through Essential Consultants, which he also used to pay Daniels before the election. \n \n The document from Avenatti says AT&T; paid Cohen $50,000 a month for four months starting in October 2017, just weeks before Trump\u2019s Justice Department filed suit to block AT&T;\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner. \n \n A spokesman for AT&T; confirmed that the company engaged Essential Consultants, a company formed by Cohen in early 2017, \u201cto provide insights into understanding the new administration.\u201d \n \n \u201cThey did no legal or lobbying work for us, and the contract ended in December 2017,\u201d the spokesman added. \n \n Cohen was receiving payments from Columbus Nova during the same months that Trump attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani has said Trump was paying Cohen $35,000 a month in legal fees. \n \n Giuliani has said Trump\u2019s money served as a reimbursement for the funds Cohen provided to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. \n \n Stephen Ryan, a lawyer for Cohen, did not respond to requests for comment. \n \n Cohen\u2019s finances are of intense interest to federal authorities in New York, who last month served search warrants on his home, office and hotel room, gathering documents related to the Daniels payment as well as to Cohen\u2019s personal businesses. \n \n Cohen\u2019s lawyers have fought in court to restrict prosecutors\u2019 access to the material seized in those raids. As part of that legal fight, they told a judge that in 2017, Cohen had three legal clients and seven clients to whom he provided \u201cstrategic advice and business consulting.\u201d \n \n Avenatti\u2019s document might provide a road map to those clients. He claims that Cohen also received payments from the drug company Novartis Investments and from Korea Aerospace Industries. Each has important business considerations with the U.S. government. \n \n Shortly after the last transaction from Novartis identified by Avenatti, in January, Trump met with executives including the incoming CEO of Novartis, Vas Narasimhan, during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \n \n A Novartis spokesman said any agreements with Essential Consultants took place before the new CEO took over in February and have since expired. \n \n Korea Aerospace is in contention for a multibillion-dollar joint contract with Lockheed Martin to produce jet trainers for the U.S. Air Force. A company representative confirmed paying the Cohen company, but said the payments were to provide legal consulting to assist in the company\u2019s reorganization of its \u201cinternal accounting system\u201d and did not involve the Air Force deal or other lobbying. \n \n The company added that it learned only recently of Essential Consultants\u2019 Trump ties. \n \n In a Wednesday morning tweet, Avenatti said it was \u201cpriceless\u201d to watch the various companies that paid Cohen try to explain their reasons for doing so. \n \n \u201cWatching all of the companies that sent money to the LLC slush fund come up with different alleged reasons for hiring Mr. Cohen \u2014 \u2018accounting advice,\u2019 \u2018real estate consulting,\u2019 \u2018insight,\u2019 etc. Who knew Mr. Cohen was such a brilliant renaissance man?\u201d \n \n Vekselberg is a Russian billionaire who regularly participates in gatherings of Russian business leaders with Putin and sometimes meets one on one with the Russian president, according to news accounts and people familiar with his role. \n \n In March 2017, the two sat down to discuss infrastructure projects, according to Russian state news reports. Vekselberg funds several critically important prestige projects, including Skolkovo, the business incubator touted as Russia\u2019s answer to Silicon Valley. \n \n Vekselberg\u2019s spokesman Andrey Shtorkh confirmed to The Washington Post in January that Vekselberg had attended Trump\u2019s inauguration as a guest of one of his American business partners. \n \n A person familiar with the inauguration said the partner was Intrater, and the New York Times has reported that Intrater and Vekselberg have both been interviewed by prosecutors working for special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. \n \n Two people familiar with Mueller\u2019s probe told The Post that the special counsel is investigating whether foreign money helped fund Trump\u2019s inauguration. By law, only U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents can donate to a U.S. inaugural committee. \n \n In addition to Intrater\u2019s donation to Trump\u2019s inauguration, an additional $1 million to support the inauguration came from Access Industries, which was founded by Leonard Blavatnik, a Soviet-born American British billionaire who is a longtime friend and business associate of Vekselberg. \n \n Shtorkh told The Post in January that Vekselberg had met the past three U.S. presidents as part of his efforts to expand Russia\u2019s international economic relations but that this was the first time the magnate attended a presidential inauguration. \n \n Photographs also show that Vekselberg attended a December 2015 dinner in Moscow to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Russian television network RT. Another attendee of the dinner, seated next to Putin, was Michael Flynn, who later became Trump\u2019s national security adviser. \n \n Alice Crites, Carol D. Leonnig, Beth Reinhard, Ashley Parker, Craig Timberg and John Wagner in Washington and Min Joo Kim in Seoul contributed to this report.",
    "summary": "\u2013 Michael Cohen's legal woes appeared to deepen Tuesday night with a bombshell release from Stormy Daniels' attorney. According to financial records reviewed by the New York Times and NBC News, a company linked to a Russian oligarch targeted by US sanctions deposited around $500,000 into an account controlled by Essential Consultants, the shell company Cohen used to pay hush money to Daniels before the 2016 election. Michael Avenatti alleges that funds from oligarch Viktor Vekselberg may have \"replenished the account\" in a series of payments in 2017 after the Daniels settlement, though Columbus Nova, a US affiliate of a Vekselberg company, denies that he was involved in its payments to Trump's personal lawyer, the Washington Post reports. The purpose of the company's payments is unclear. Sources tell CNN that Robert Mueller's investigators have already quizzed Vekselberg about the payments to Cohen's company. Records reviewed by the Times show that around $4.4 million flowed through the Essential Consultants account between its creation weeks before the 2016 election and January this year, including hundreds of thousands of dollars from pharmaceutical firm Novartis, AT&T, and Korea Aerospace. AT&T confirmed the payments late Tuesday, saying Cohen's firm was among those it \"engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration,\" the AP reports. Cohen isn't a registered lobbyist, and while the unusual payments may not have broken any laws, Trump and his attorney \"have a lot of explaining to do,\" Avenatti said in a tweet Tuesday.",

    "document": "LAPORTE, Ind. (WOOD) \u2014 A man convicted of four 1993 murders who escaped Sunday from a state prison outside of Ionia was captured in Indiana Monday evening. \n \n Michael David Elliot, 40, was arrested in Kankakee Township in rural LaPorte County, Ind., and allegedly stole a total of four vehicles in his 24-hour run from the law. He was arraigned Tuesday in Indiana on auto theft charges. \n \n The sheriff\u2019s department had been looking for a black 2002 Chevrolet Monte Carlo that was stolen from the area of Boyd Avenue and E. Lincolnway in LaPorte, authorities said. Deputy Jeffrey Wright said the vehicle\u2019s engine was on so it would warm up when it was taken. The sheriff\u2019s department was alerted to the theft at 6:16 p.m. ET, according to a Monday night news release. \n \n Within minutes of learning of the theft, Deputy Slawek Czupryna spotted the stolen vehicle headed south on Boyd Boulevard in LaPorte. He attempted a traffic stop, but the driver didn\u2019t pull over. Instead, the driver fled, leading deputies on a short chase. \n \n Stop Sticks were deployed just before 6:30 p.m., the sheriff\u2019s office said. \n \n \u201cHe ran over a couple of sets of Stop Sticks that some of our sergeants had laid out, so his tires were going flat. He lost control of the vehicle and slid into a snowbank,\u201d Deputy Wright told 24 Hour News 8. \n \n That snowbank was at the T-intersection of N 250 E between East Division and E 150 N in Kankakee Township, east of LaPorte. \n \n Elliot then tried to climb out of the car\u2019s window, Wright said. Deputies Czupryna and Wright each grabbed one of Elliot\u2019s shoulders, pulled him from the car, laid him on the ground and handcuffed him. No one was hurt. \n \n When asked what his name was, Elliot answered truthfully, Wright said. He said he asked Elliot if he was \u201c\u2018the Michael Elliot,\u201d and Elliot confirmed he was the escapee. Wright said he was surprised that Elliot didn\u2019t lie about his identity. \n \n Wright then put Elliot into the back of his cruiser and took him to the LaPorte County Jail. Elliot is being held without bond on felony car theft and resisting charges. \n \n Wright described Elliot was polite to officers, and quiet and emotionless during the ride to jail. Elliot looked tired, Wright said, like he had not slept in days. Wright said Elliot was wearing jeans that were too big and \u201ca couple of jackets.\u201d \n \n Wright said authorities didn\u2019t know Elliot would be in their area \u2014 there was more concern he may be in the Shipshewana area \u2014 and that he did not expect the man he was chasing to be Elliot. Wright said he was relieved that he and Czupryna were able to get Elliot off the streets and bring worried citizens some peace of mind. \n \n In a Monday night news release, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder thanked the law enforcement agencies that aided in the search and capture of Elliot. \u201cThe swift apprehension of this dangerous criminal is a credit to law enforcement and corrections officials in Michigan and Indiana, and our partners with the U.S. Marshals Service. Their courage, diligence and professionalism reminds us how fortunate we are to have such men and women who are willing to keep our communities safe. \u2026Now that we are assured the public is safe, we will turn our attention to thoroughly reviewing the situation that led to the prisoner\u2019s escape. We will demand an exhaustive assessment of the incident and take whatever appropriate action is needed to prevent future incidents.\u201d \n \n Elliot escaped around 7 p.m. Sunday from the Ionia Correctional Facility, but jail workers didn\u2019t notice he was missing until a routine prisoner check at 9 p.m. \n \n Authorities said Elliot left through the sally port, a secured garage where prisoners are brought into the facility. Elliot then got through a hole in the fencing system which, according to a former corrections officer, is made up of two 12-foot high, razor wire-topped fencing sections with a smaller, electrified fence in between them. \n \n He then made a three-and-a-half mile trek into Ionia where he carjacked a woman, police said. The two then drove to the Elkhart, Ind. area. The woman escaped at a gas station there and he fled in her Jeep Liberty. That SUV was found early Monday morning in Shipshewana, Ind. \n \n LaPorte County, where Elliot was arrested, is west of Shipshewana. \n \n Elliot was serving five life sentences in the Ionia Correctional Facility after being convicted of four 1993 murders. \n \n In the early morning of Aug. 8, 1993, according to court documents, Elliot broke into a home in Bentley Township, north of Midland, killed four people then set the house on fire. Vickie Currie, her boyfriend Michael Tufnell, his cousin Bruce Squires Tufnell Jr. and fiancee Cathy Lave were killed. \n \n Charles and Paul Treece, and Tammy LaCross were with Elliot when the murders were committed. Charles Treece was also convicted of four counts of first-degree murder, armed robbery and setting a house on fire, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a firearm. He is also serving life in prison at the Alger Correctional Facility in Munising in the Upper Peninsula. \n \n LaCross, who was 16 at the time and is victim Vickie Currie\u2019s daughter, and Paul Treece both testified against Elliot. Under the terms of plea agreements, they pleaded guilty to robbery and felony firearm charges. \n \n In 2005, Elliot filed a motion for release, saying that there was new evidence in his case \u2014 namely a 1994 letter from Charles Treece that attested to Elliot\u2019s innocence. A state court denied his request. \n \n Elliot maintains he is innocent, according to the court documents. \n \n \u2014\u2013 \n \n Inside woodtv.com: \n \n Michael Elliot escapes from Ionia Correctional Facility \n \n Former guard: Elliot\u2019s escape a \u2018mystery\u2019 \n \n \u2018Thorough\u2019 investigation of escape promised \n \n Son \u2018proud\u2019 of Elliot\u2019s carjack victim for staying calm \n \n Victim\u2019s mother worried Elliot would kill again \n \n Life as a Level II prison inmate \n \n Share this: Email \n \n Print \n \n Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Google \n \n Pinterest \n \n More \n \n LinkedIn \n \n Tumblr \n \n \n \n Reddit \n \n ||||| More Video... \n \n A source close to the investigation tells NewsCenter 16 convicted murderer Michael Elliot was arrested in LaPorte County after a chase Monday night. \n \n The manhunt for 40-year- old Elliot started Sunday night, after he escaped from Ionia Correctional Facility in Michigan. \n \n Elliot was convicted of four murders in 1993 and is serving five life sentences. \n \n Michigan Department of Corrections Director Dan Heyns says officers realized Elliot was gone during a routine count at about 9 p.m. Sunday. After looking at surveillance tapes, they realized he escaped somewhere between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. \n \n Heyns says during the time of the escape, Elliot was dressed in a white kitchen uniform. It is unknown at this time how he got that uniform. Heyns says Elliot was not assigned to the kitchen. \n \n They believe it was the color of that uniform that had something to do with his ability to get by multiple security cameras and interior and perimeter fencing. \n \n After escaping, Elliot carjacked a woman using a box cutter. He held her hostage during the more than 100-mile drive to Elkhart County. \n \n They stopped for gas around 11 p.m. at a Marathon gas station near the intersection of SR 13 and CR 2, near Middlebury. The woman escaped Elliot at the station by asking for a cup for water, then locking herself in the bathroom and calling 911. \n \n Elliot fled in the victim's car before police arrived. \n \n Indiana State Police say the red Jeep Liberty he fled in was found in the 400 block of North State Street in Shipshewana Monday afternoon. A woman living in the neighborhood noticed the car matched the description of one given on the news, so she called police around 12:15 p.m. But, police say the car was seen in the area as early as 5:30 a.m. \n \n \"You can go a lot of places in seven hours,\" said Sgt. Ron Galaviz with the Indiana State Police. \"Especially if you have a mode of transportation. And, I'm not suggesting he does. But, again, we're looking for stolen vehicle reports or anything of that nature to help follow up on, to help us pursue on that trail.\" \n \n Police went door-to-door looking for any signs of Elliot in Shipshewana. Westview Schools were notified of the situation and placed on lock down. Students were later dismissed, with a heavy police presence on site to ensure their safety. Police say all students were accounted for and the schools were thoroughly searched. \n \n Indiana State Police say after searching the community, their hunt for Elliot in Shipshewana has been suspended and they have no new leads. They don't know if he is still in Michiana or has traveled elsewhere since abandoning the Jeep. \n \n \"What we're asking the public to do is to remain vigilant,\" Galaviz said. \"If you see something, say something. If something appears out of order, if a door seems unlocked, if a window is broken, don't investigate it. Call 911.\" \n \n \\NBC affiliate WSMV in Nashville says early Monday morning, a woman thought she spotted Elliot at a Tennessee gas station. But, police say it was a false identification. Elliot has family in Tennessee. \n \n He is described as a 5'8, 165-pound white male with brown hair and eyes. Elliot was wearing a blue and orange state prison uniform when he escaped, but he was last seen in black pants, a white t-shirt, white tennis shoes and a white beanie cap. \n \n Elliot should be considered armed and dangerous. Anyone who comes in contact with him, should contact law enforcement immediately. \n \n According to Grand Rapids-based WOOD-TV, Elliot was serving five life sentences for four murders and an armed robbery. He was convicted in 1993. He was also serving 13 years for setting a house on fire and two years for using a firearm during the commission of a felony.",

    "document": "\"War by its nature entails waste. But the scale of the problems in Iraq and Afghanistan also reflects the toxic interplay of huge sums of money pumped into relatively small economies and an unprecedented reliance on contractors,\" the report said. \n \n Sen. James Webb, D-Virginia, who helped establish the commission three years ago, said Friday that its latest proposals deserve attention from Congress and the Department of Defense and called for a hearing on the matter. \n \n \"The report's specific recommendations to address the federal government's overreliance on contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan and failure to control the process underscore the importance of the Commission's charter,\" Webb said in a prepared statement. \n \n The report repeatedly criticized the federal government for turning to contractors for too many purposes, including monitoring other contractors. \n \n \"The government has abdicated its contracting responsibilities -- too often using contractors as the default mechanism, driven by considerations other than whether they provide the best solution, and without consideration for the resources needed to manage them,\" the report said. \n \n The commission is calling for major reforms to how the government awards and monitors contractors on military, reconstruction and training programs. \n \n \"When it comes to oversight of contingency contracting, we've been driving beyond the reach of our headlights,\" Commission Co-Chairman Michael Thibault said in a statement released with the report. \"Reforms are badly needed.\" \n \n The report says that contractors often face great risks. \"Between September 2001 and December 2010, over 2,200 contractor employees of all nationalities have died and over 49,800 were injured in Iraq and Afghanistan,\" the report says. \"These contractors' deaths and injuries should not be ignored, but should be a part of the public debate on the cost of war.\" \n \n Among the proposals to rein in contractors is the creation of special teams of full-time federal workers to be ready to deploy and monitor projects. The report says the government also should restrict reliance on contractors for security by embedding government workers responsible for command and control and oversight. ||||| -An ill-conceived project, no matter how well-managed, is wasteful if it does not fit the cultural, political and economic mores of the society it is meant to serve, or if it cannot be supported and maintained. \n \n \n \n -Poor planning and oversight by the US government, as well as poor performance on the part of contractors, have costly outcomes: time and money misspent are lost for other purposes. \n \n \n \n -Criminal behavior and blatant corruption sap dollars from what could otherwise be successful project outcomes and, more disturbingly, contribute to a climate in which huge amounts of waste are accepted as the norm. \n \n \n \n Since 2002, the United States has spent $117 billion on contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan. According to a new report by the non-partisan Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan, tens of billions of those dollars have been wasted.The report's authors note that the \"waste, fraud, and abuse\" they have observed in these contract programs were caused by significant errors. A few of their points, quoted from the report:The U.S. has relied on contractors more heavily in these two wars than in previous others, hiring about 200,000 of them to \"guard bases, build facilities, provide food and laundry services, escort supply and personnel movements, and translate local languages,\" according to Susan Crabtree at Talking Points Memo. She points out that there are almost as many contracted employees working in Afghanistan and Iraq as there are military troops.The commission that put out the report is urging the government to reform its contracting programs and is holding a hearing to review the report's findings today. ||||| WASHINGTON -- The chairmen of the bipartisan Commission on Wartime Contracting decried on Monday a federal system that has allowed contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan to commit fraud -- then get hired again and again. \n \n \"For the 200,000 people employed by contractors to provide support and capability in Iraq and Afghanistan, accountability is too often absent, diluted, delayed, or avoided,\" Republican co-chair Chris Shays, formerly a longtime congressman from Connecticut, said while calling to order a hearing of the commission Monday. \n \n There are so many barriers to suspending or banning contractors with violations that \"untrustworthy contractors can continue profiting from government work, responsible businesses may be denied opportunities, and costs to taxpayers can climb,\" Shays said in a statement co-authored with his Democratic co-chair, Michael Thibault, formerly the deputy director of the Defense Contract Audit Agency. \n \n The commission last week issued a blistering interim report to Congress: \"At What Risk? Correcting over-reliance on contractors in contingency operations,\" which concluded that \"misspent dollars run into the tens of billions\" out of the nearly $200 billion spent on contracts and grants since 2002 to support military, reconstruction and other U.S. operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. \n \n And that could well be an understatement, the commission noted, because \"it might not take full account of ill-conceived projects, poor planning and oversight by the U.S. government, and criminal behavior and blatant corruption by both government and contractor employees.\" \n \n The report suggested that the government stop using contractors so routinely, start taking oversight more seriously and establish strong interagency standards. \n \n It called for an end to contractors' current role in hiring other contractors, concluding that they tend not to erect the appropriate oversight firewalls. \n \n And most controversially, the report said the extensive use of private security contractors -- which has surged under President Barack Obama -- raises use-of-force issues and creates a gap in legal accountability \n \n So rather than let them run wild, the commission recommended that agencies relying on private security contractors be required to embed government personnel among them who would be \"responsible for leadership, command and control, and oversight of all security contractors and operations.\" \n \n (The commission also promised that its final report, due this summer, will further address the over-reliance on private contractors to provide \"movement security\" for government workers in war zones. That's a shot across the bow of the State Department.) \n \n The commission's findings, however, are just the latest in a litany of official and journalistic reports about the enormous cost of waste, fraud and corruption in Iraq and, particularly, Afghanistan. \n \n Just last month, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction warned that the entire $11.4 billion for constructing and maintaining nearly 900 Afghan National Security Forces facilities is at risk due to inadequate planning. \n \n The Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction said in 2009 that an estimated $3 billion to $5 billion in U.S.-funded infrastructure contracting had been wasted there. \n \n McClatchy Newspapers have exposed example after example of waste and abuse in contracts for Afghan reconstruction. \n \n A State Department cable obtained by WikiLeaks revealed late last year that Afghanistan's vice president had been caught carrying $52 million in cash in a Persian Gulf tax haven. \n \n (See 10 more examples.) \n \n In his remarks at Monday's hearing, Scott Amey, general counsel for the nonprofit watchdog group Project on Government Oversight (POGO), testified that \"contract award dollars have increased from approximately $200 billion in fiscal year 2000 to over $535 billion in fiscal year 2010.\" Meanwhile, however, \"contract administration and oversight have decreased because the acquisition workforce is stretched thin,\" he said. \n \n Since 2002, POGO has maintained a Federal Contract Misconduct Database, which served as the model for the government-created Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), due to become publicly available starting in April. \n \n Witnesses at Monday's hearing said, however, that the federal database doesn't adequately record contractors' past performance. \n \n As it happens, the Obama administration recently caved to pressure from contractors and won't be making that past performance data available publicly. \n \n But even internally, witnesses said, the state of the data is abysmal. Of the 1,485 past performance reports required from the Department of Defense, only 140 had been entered into the database. Of the 174 required from the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development, not a single one could actually be found, although USAID insisted 24 had been entered. \n \n And Dan Gordon, President Obama's administrator for federal procurement policy, said three-quarters of the performance reports that were filed still lacked required documentation. \n \n But judging from POGO's database, Amey testified: \n \n Some of the largest service contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan have checkered histories of misconduct, including instances of shooting civilians, false claims against the government, violations of the Anti-Kickback Act, fraud, retaliation against workers' complaints, and environmental violations. \n \n Amey also raised an all-too-familiar concern, though from another context: \n \n The government's inability to hold all contractors accountable begs the question: Is the government so reliant on large contractors that bad actors are required to preserving legitimate competition and mission accomplishment? This might be the contracting version of \"too big to fail.\" \n \n ************************* \n \n Dan Froomkin is senior Washington correspondent for the Huffington Post.

(CBS) \u2014 Several multi-vehicles crashes, involving as many as 100 cars and dozens of tractor-trailers stretched over several miles of icy highway, shut down the Pennsylvania Turnpike for most of the day today between Willow Grove and Bensalem, Pa. \n \n One crash area involved approximately 75 cars and several tractor-trailers in the eastbound lanes of the highway. The westbound lanes were closed to allow access by emergency vehicles. \n \n According to the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, 30 people were injured and transported to local hospitals. Doylestown Hospital confirmed it was treating one victim who was in stable condition, while Abington was reportedly treating 16 people. St. Mary\u2019s Medical Center, in Langhorne, was treating seven and Temple University Hospital was treating one. CBS 3 is told five of the injuries are classified as serious, but none are considered life-threatening. \n \n Dr. John Kelly, chief of staff at Abington, says the good news is none of the injuries are serious. \n \n \u201cThe word that we have is that we may have seen the most severely injured at this point in time, which we\u2019re pleased to say did not include any life-threatening injuries that we are aware of.\u201d \n \n Kelly explained what kind of injuries they were seeing, \u201cIn a blunt trauma situation, you\u2019re going to have a lot of soft tissue and bone type injuries. I\u2019m unaware of any fractures to date. We did have one patient who had a closed- head injury but appears to be recovering well from that.\u201d \n \n The incident began about 8:30am in the eastbound lanes between Willow Grove and the Route 1 exits in Bensalem, Pa. \n \n Another crash happened closer to the Route 1 exit. That accident area involved approximately 30 cars and included a jackknifed tractor-trailer. \n \n Chopper 3 was over the scene where it appeared at least four cars were stuck under the jackknifed tractor-trailer. \n \n \u201cWe believe that it looks like at this point that the initial incident involved several tractor-trailer trucks. There have been reports of three to four. State police are working through sorting all that out right now,\u201d Carl DeFebo of the Pa.

Turnpike Commission reported around 3:30 p.m. that the tractor-trailer blocking all eastbound lanes was moved to allow trapped backlog to get past the scene in the left lane to continue eastbound on I-276. Disabled commercial vehicles remained, but all passenger vehicles in the backlog had been removed. \n \n Other crews were removing small portions of the concrete median, to allow drivers trapped on the eastbound turnpike to U-turn onto the westbound lanes (which were also shut down to all but emergency vehicles) and get off the turnpike. \n \n The turnpike was reopened to traffic just before 4pm \u2014 about 7\u00bd hours after the first crash occurred. \n \n Investigators indicate icy conditions and sun glare are being blamed as likely culprits in causing the pileup. \n \n One driver said that road spray on windshields plus the sun low in the sky may have hindered visibility as drivers found themselves suddenly upon a stopped vehicle ahead with insufficient room to stop on the slick pavement. \n \n Terry Foley seemed to agree. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s all ice,\u201d Foley said. \n \n A total of 75 cars and trucks, including six tractor trailers, were taken to Rob Liepziger\u2019s tow yard in Bristol, Bucks County alone. Many of them have front-end damage, back-end damage and a lot of the vehicles have been totaled. \n \n Rob\u2019s been in the towing business for more than 30 years. \n \n \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything like this in forever that I\u2019ve been out here,\u201d Liepziger said. \n \n Top Content On CBSPhilly PHOTOS: Summer's Hottest Concerts \n \n VIDEO: Latest News & Weather \n \n AUDIO: Podcasts & Shows \n \n NEWS: Top Headlines \n \n PHOTOS: View The Best Galleries ||||| Get breaking news alerts on your mobile device direct from the FOX 29 news desk. \n \n Get breaking news alerts on your mobile device direct from the FOX 29 news desk. \n \n Get breaking news alerts on your mobile device direct from the FOX 29 news desk. \n \n Get breaking news alerts on your mobile device direct from the FOX 29 news desk. \n \n Text 46373 To 'NEWS' To Get Breaking News Alerts From FOX 29 \n \n It was an all-day mess on the Pennsylvania Turnpike with the road shut down for miles after two major pileups and several other wrecks in between. \n \n The crashes left dozens of drivers stranded in the cold. Up to 50 cars were involved in those pileups. \n \n Here's what we know: \n \n The crashes on Interstate 276 were first reported just after 8 a.m. right in the middle of the morning rush, closing the turnpike between Willow Grove and the Philadelphia Interchanges in Bensalem; \n \n A total of 27 people were taken to hospitals, at least four of them with serious injuries; \n \n Drivers say the roadway was icy and incredibly slick. \n \n From the air, the long scene looked like an auto junkyard with dozens and dozens of cars and trucks scattered every which way. \n \n Drivers caught in the middle of the wreckage told us traffic had been moving smoothly at 50 to 55 mph until suddenly, \"All we saw was brake lights. Everybody locked up their wheels, and next thing you know the sun glare, the spray from the road, everything hit us all at once,\" said Bill Warrin, of Broomall, Pa. \n \n \"It was like a perfect storm, and then boom,\" he added. \n \n At the front of dozens of separate wrecks were two 18-wheelers, a box truck and several passenger cars. \n \n This stretch of the turnpike is three tight lanes, a wall of snow on one side, a concrete median Jersey barrier on the other. \n \n When cars ahead began to crash, there was no way to avoid impact. \n \n From the ground it was clear there was plenty of hard, packed ice on the road surface, a reminder of our massive snowstorm that lasted Wednesday night into Friday morning. \n \n But drivers told us conditions were deceiving. \n \n \"It was much icier once you got out of the car than you expected it to be,\" said Frank Atkinson, of Furlong, Pa. \"It seemed like it was slushy maybe, but it didn't seem like it was icy.\" \n \n The Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission had lifted its storm-related speed limit and ban on some commercial vehicles just two hours before the crash. \n \n But a spokesman said that decision does not let drivers off the hook. \n \n \"It boils down to responsibility of motorists,\" turnpike spokesman Carl DeFebo said. \"That's our job when we're driving on the roads to monitor the conditions and to be sure that we are adjusting our speeds that are appropriate to whatever the driving conditions are.\" \n \n By early afternoon, a parade of flat-bed tow trucks was removing vehicles caught in the mess. \n \n The extent of the damage was a reminder that the injury toll could have been much higher, FOX 29's Bruce Gordon reported. \n \n In the second video clip above, FOX 29's Thalia Perez reports that all but one of the injured persons taken to Abington Memorial Hospital had been treated and released by Friday night.

    "summary": "\u2013 More than 100 cars and dozens of tractor trailers have been caught up in a chain of accidents stretching over several miles of the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Bensalem this morning, backing up traffic for several more miles behind that. The first accident came at about 7:45am on the westbound side, causing a rubbernecking delay on the eastbound side\u2014where the subsequent crashes occurred beginning at 8am, Fox 29 Philadelphia reports. Icy conditions are believed to be responsible\u2014though residents say that stretch of road is so notoriously treacherous that accidents sometimes occur there in good weather. One crash site involves roughly 75 cars and several tractor trailers, CBS 3 Philadelphia reports. Another 30 cars were involved in another big wreck, in which a tractor trailer jackknifed, reportedly landing on top of at least four cars. Emergency crews are now using the westbound side to transport out the wounded. At least five people have been hospitalized so far. This is \"the worst accident I have seen in the 20 years I have been doing this,\" CBS' traffic reporter said.",

    "document": "Confectionery giant Nestle has failed to convince European judges that it has the right to trademark the shape of its four-finger KitKat bar in the UK. \n \n The European Court of Justice said that the company had to demonstrate the public relied on the shape alone to identify the snack. \n \n The judges concluded this was difficult to prove if goods also showed a brand name such as KitKat. \n \n Rival Cadbury has battled to prevent Nestle obtaining the trademark. \n \n Both Nestle and Cadbury said they were \"pleased\" with the ruling. \n \n The case will now return to the UK High Court for a final decision. \n \n Nestle claimed that in the 80 years since the chocolate bar was introduced, the four fingers have become almost completely associated with KitKats. \n \n In June, a senior European court lawyer, the advocate-general, disagreed saying such a trademark did not comply with European law. \n \n Nestle has not sought to trademark the two-fingered bar. \n \n Sally Britton, intellectual property lawyer at Mishcon de Reya, said that Nestle was likely to continue arguing its case, \"even if, as now appears likely, the English court decides that the KitKat shape should not be registered as a trade mark\". \n \n She said Nestle had experience of trying to register difficult marks. \n \n It took more than 40 years for it to register the slogan \"Have a Break\" as a trade mark, finally succeeding in 2006, she added. \n \n Image caption Norway's \"Kvikk Lunsj\" looks similar to the KitKat and is available in some parts of the UK \n \n Chocolate wars \n \n Wednesday's ruling is the latest development in a more than 10-year legal battle between Nestle and Cadbury, which started when Cadbury tried to trademark the purple colour it uses on its Cadbury chocolate wrappers. \n \n Nestle objected and finally had the original decision allowing Cadbury to trademark the colour overturned in 2013. \n \n Now it would appear Cadbury, which is owned by US company Mondelez International, has scored a significant but not final victory in the continuing chocolate war. \n \n It has always argued the shape alone was not distinctive enough for consumers to associate it with the rival snack. \n \n A bar called the Kvikk Lunsj, meaning \"quick lunch\", launched in Norway in 1937 is available in some UK shops, and although less well known, looks similar to the four-finger KitKat. \n \n A ruling in favour of Nestle would stop other confectionery producers making chocolate bars of the same shape or size. ||||| The origin of the name \n \n The Kit Kat name originates from the late 17th century in London, when a literary club met at a pie shop owned by pastry chef Christoppher Catling. The group was called the Kit Kat club and took its name from an abbreviated version of the owner's name. ||||| SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email \n \n Photographer: Jason Adlen/Bloomberg Photographer: Jason Adlen/Bloomberg \n \n Nestle SA may find it harder to convince U.K. judges that the shape of its KitKat chocolate bar is distinct enough to trademark after the European Union\u2019s top tribunal set strict limits on what qualifies for the status. \n \n For a shape to deserve a trademark, owners must prove that consumers can recognize the product exclusively by that characteristic, and not in combination with another trademarked aspect, the EU Court of Justice said in a ruling Wednesday. The judgment gave both sides an opportunity to claim victory. \n \n The EU court decision will help guide a U.K. tribunal handling a clash between Cadbury, the U.K.\u2019s biggest chocolate maker, and Nestle over the Swiss company\u2019s 2010 application to trademark the four-fingered chocolate bar, which brought in 40 million pounds ($61.7 million) a year between 2008 and 2010 in the U.K. Cadbury separately is fighting an EU trademark Nestle got for the shape of its chocolate bar in 2006 in a case that\u2019s been pending in a lower EU court since 2013. Any decision will determine whether or not the trademark is valid. \n \n The KitKat was first sold in Britain in 1935 by Rowntree & Co., with the shape changing very little since then. Nestle, the world\u2019s biggest food company, bought Rowntree Plc in 1998. \n \n The U.K. Trade Marks Registry turned down the application to protect the shape of the chocolate bar in the U.K. in 2013 following the opposition from Cadbury. \n \n The EU court Wednesday said trademark protection can\u2019t be given if a shape \u201ccontains three essential features, one of which results from the nature of the goods themselves and two of which are necessary to obtain a technical result.\u201d \n \n Vevey, Switzerland-based Nestle said it was \u201cpleased with the decision\u201d and \u201cnow looks forward to the decision of the U.K. High Court.\u201d Mondelez International Inc., which owns Cadbury, said in an e-mailed statement that the court\u2019s ruling \u201cis in line with our contention that the shape of the KitKat bar is not distinctive enough to be protected as a trademark.\u201d \n \n Nestle won a U.K. Court of Appeal ruling in October 2013 blocking Cadbury from obtaining a trademark for the color purple it uses to package its milk chocolate. \n \n The case is: C-215/14, Societe de Produits Nestle SA v. Cadbury UK Ltd.",
    "summary": "\u2013 It started with a candy wrapper and ended (for now) in a courtroom. Nestle's attempts to trademark the shape of its \"four-fingered\" KitKat have been rejected by the European Court of Justice, which ruled that shape alone isn't enough to recognize it as a KitKat, the BBC reports. The decision was a setback for Nestle\u2014which manages the brand overseas; Hershey is licensed to sell the brand here in the US\u2014and a victory for Cadbury, which was trying to block the trademark. The ruling means that, for now, other candy companies can make similar-looking chocolate bars. Nestle, which reaped more than $60 million a year from 2008 to 2010 in the UK from KitKat, argued that the four-fingered design has become inextricably associated with the KitKat brand over the past eight decades, Bloomberg notes. But Cadbury said the shape wasn't enough to make a consumer automatically think \"KitKat,\" and the court agreed. The BBC even notes that in Norway, a lesser-known chocolate bar called Kvikk Lunsj (\"quick lunch\") has been around for nearly as long as KitKat. The fight between the two confectionary giants is the second major brouhaha they've had in recent years: In 2013, Nestle managed to block Cadbury's attempts to trademark its signature purple-colored chocolate wrappers, per Bloomberg. KitKat case now heads back to the UK High Court, which will render a final decision. (Claims of excess lead in Nestle noodles led to a major recall in India.)",

Penn wrote a colorful story for Rolling Stone about the encounter. \n \n \n \n What drew Coronel's wrath \u2014 and that of her husband, she believes \u2014 is a video posted with the article in which Guzman, sitting in front of a fence in a country setting, acknowledges he has worked in the drug trade since he was 15 \u2014 drawn to it because of the poverty in the rural mountains. \n \n \n \n Coronel said that publishing the video, whose rights were granted not by Penn but by Del Castillo's company, was a \"betrayal.\" Her husband, she said, believed that the footage would be used only as background information for a text article. \n \n \n \n Del Castillo's lawyer, Los Angeles attorney Harland Braun, said the drug lord clearly understood that the actress was there to talk about a movie \u2014 a project he said she is still pursuing. \"He's admitting [in the video] to being a drug trafficker. And the point that he's in the drug business, that embarrasses him? The whole point of the movie is that he's in the drug business. What she's saying doesn't make any sense.\" \n \n \n \n Then there was the affectionate exchange of messages between her husband and Del Castillo, leaked to the Mexican publication Milenio after his latest arrest. \"You are so beautiful, my friend, in every way,\" Guzman told the actress in one of them. \"I will take care of you more than I do my own eyes.\" \n \n \n \n Coronel said she did not find the exchanges troubling. \"I think it was the first time they met. How could it be a personal relationship?\" she said. \"At no time did I feel jealous of Kate.\"",
    "summary": "\u2013 It's no surprise that Mexico is keeping a very close eye on drug lord Joaquin Guzman after recapturing him for the second time\u2014but that doesn't mean his wife has to like it.

    "document": "PAHOA, Hawaii (Reuters) - Residents on the Big Island of Hawaii were alerted on Thursday to rising levels of toxic gas from lava-oozing fissures, and geologists warned that new areas east of the erupting Kilauea volcano may be at risk of molten rock bursting from the ground. \n \n Hawaii County authorities sent a text message to residents of the southeast corner of the island warning them of a wind change that would bring rising levels of sulfur dioxide gas, which can be fatal if inhaled in large quantities. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s just horrible. You can\u2019t breathe in there,\u201d said evacuated resident Robynn Stagg, 58, who drove through the thick, orange sulfur dioxide haze earlier this week in a failed attempt to check on her home. \n \n Hawaii\u2019s governor has warned that mass evacuations may be required as more fissures open in the ground and spew lava and gas into semi-rural residential areas on the east flank of Kilauea, one of the world\u2019s most active volcanoes. \n \n During an evening meeting with community members, an official with the United States Geological Survey\u2019s Hawaii Volcano Observatory said that while no new fissures have opened during the last 24 hours, there has been \u201cquite a bit\u201d of ground cracking over the last day and that they were releasing steam. \n \n \u201cBecause the lava intrusion is still active and earthquakes are still occurring, we still think there\u2019s a decent chance of new eruptive activity at the surface,\u201d Steven Brantley said. \n \n Authorities on Thursday completed the removal of highly flammable chemicals from a nearby geothermal power plant that was in the path of creeping lava. \n \n The latest upheaval at Kilauea began last week after the crater floor of a long-active side vent collapsed suddenly in a cloud of ash, triggering a similar plunge in the molten lake inside the larger crater at the volcano\u2019s summit. \n \n What followed was a flurry of earthquakes as huge volumes of magma \u2014 the term for lava beneath the surface \u2014 drained back through deep-underground passages that carried the molten rock far downslope. The lava then forced its way back to the surface through large cracks, or fissures, that opened at ground level in a residential area miles (km) away. \n \n (GRAPHIC: Scorched earth - tmsnrt.rs/2IldVyS) \n \n \u2018BALLISTIC BLOCKS\u2019 \n \n Geologists said Kilauea may be entering a new phase of explosive eruptions not seen in nearly a century that could hurl \u201cballistic blocks\u201d weighing up to 12 tons for half a mile (800 meters), and rain pebble-sized fragments for another mile or two (1.8 to 3.2 km). \n \n Deposits are seen on a road in Puna, Hawaii.

In addition, acid rain damages vegetation and causes tools, barbed-wire fencing and items that can rust to do so a lot faster. \n \n Light winds may allow volcanic haze to become more widespread on the Big Island through Friday night, but weather forecasters said there did not appear to be enough southeast flow to carry the vog to other islands. By late Friday night or Saturday morning, tradewinds should be back, helping to push the vog out to sea. \n \n The primary pollutants in vog, or volcanic smog, are sulfur dioxide gas and fine particulate matter. \n \n The American Lung Association warned the public that sulfur dioxide can have harmful effects on the lungs and cause respiratory problems. Sulfur dioxide irritates the nose, throat and airways to cause coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath or a tight feeling around the chest \u2014 and can trigger asthma attacks. \n \n The effects of sulfur dioxide can be felt very quickly, according to the association, and are especially harmful to children, older adults and people with respiratory conditions. \n \n A two-person team from the Hawaii and Arizona National Guards monitored air quality near fissures in Leilani Estates Wednesday and found no dangerous levels of sulfur dioxide. \n \n Sgt. Milo Kalama of the Hawaii National Guard\u2019s 93rd Weapons of Mass Destruction-Civil Support Team approached a steaming fissure on Leilani Avenue wearing a black, full-face mask. As his air-monitoring equipment buzzed, Kalama removed his mask and declared the air quality normal. \n \n Kau Hospital and Rural Health Clinic reported an uptick in the number of patients with respiratory illness in the emergency room and clinic. \n \n \u201cThey\u2019re having difficulty breathing and respiratory issues. It\u2019s starting in Kau,\u201d said hospital spokeswoman Elena Cabatu. \u201cPeople please continue to heed civil defense warnings and read up on the precautions they can take. We\u2019re definitely monitoring our supplies very closely and taking inventory of respiratory therapy supplies. We\u2019re making sure we\u2019re stocked so we\u2019re ready to go.\u201d \n \n Hilo Medical Center, however, has not seen an increase in respiratory patients, she said. \n \n The state Health Department has placed sulfur dioxide and particulate monitoring equipment around the eruption site. Once it is up and running, air quality data from the site will become available online. \n \n Honolulu Star-Advertiser writers Dan Nakaso and Kristen Consillio contributed to this report. ||||| Evacuee Jon Warner, left, walks through rain with son Ethan, right, and daughter Iris after picking up some basic necessities at a makeshift donation center Tuesday, May 8, 2018, in Pahoa, Hawaii. \"We've... (Associated Press) \n \n PAHOA, Hawaii (AP) \u2014 The Latest on a Hawaii volcano eruption (all times local): \n \n 2 p.m. \n \n Hawaii's governor is asking President Donald Trump to declare the state a disaster because of earthquakes and a volcanic eruption on the Big Island. \n \n Gov. David Ige said Thursday the disaster is so severe that direct federal help is needed. \n \n State officials estimate it will cost more than $2.9 million to protect residents over the next 30 days. The costs will skyrocket if there needs to be large-scale air and sea evacuations. \n \n Two subdivisions were ordered to evacuate last week after lava oozed from cracks in the ground, burning down some two dozen homes. \n \n Ige says there's potential for a larger-scale evacuation as more fissures open. He says mass evacuation would be beyond county and state capabilities. \n \n ___ \n \n 12:30 p.m. \n \n Officials say they aren't expecting a possible explosive volcano eruption to be life-threatening as long as people stay out of a surrounding Hawaii national park that's preparing to close. \n \n Scientists worry Kilauea volcano could soon send boulders and ash shooting out of its summit crater. \n \n No one lives in the immediate area of the summit. It's within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, which plans to close Thursday night. \n \n Hawaii Volcano Observatory scientist Tina Neal says communities a mile or two away may be showered by pea-sized fragments or dusted with nontoxic ash. \n \n Active eruption of lava from fissures some 25 miles (40.2 kilometers) east of the summit has paused. However, earthquakes continue and additional fissure outbreaks are expected. \n \n Authorities ordered two subdivisions in the area to evacuate last week. \n \n Workers have removed flammable pentane from a nearby geothermal plant. \n \n ___ \n \n 11 a.m. \n \n Flammable pentane has been moved out of a Hawaii geothermal plant that's near communities where lava has oozed from cracks in the ground. \n \n Plant manager Mike Kaleikini said Thursday that all the fuel was moved off-site to a secure location. \n \n Hawaii County Managing Director Wil Okabe says the pentane was moved to an industrial park some 30 miles (48 kilometers) away from the Puna Geothermal Venture. \n \n The pant sits on the edge of Leilani Estates, one of the areas where nearly 2,000 residents have been forced to evacuate as Kilauea spewed lava. And with new fissures opening closer to the edge of the plant, residents are getting even more worried. \n \n Scientists say active eruption of lava within the Leilani Estates remains paused. However, earthquake activity and ground deformation continue and additional outbreaks in the general area are expected. \n \n ___ \n \n 10:15 a.m. \n \n Authorities have accelerated the timeline for moving flammable pentane from a Hawaii geothermal plant that's near communities where lava has oozed from cracks in the ground. \n \n Workers are moving the fuel to an industrial park about 30 miles (48.2 kilometers) away. All 50,000 gallons (189,270 liters) of pentane was expected to be removed by the end of Thursday. \n \n Pentane is a flammable liquid similar to lighter fluid, or butane. \n \n Officials said earlier this week they had planned to move the pentane over the next few weeks but accelerated the effort because of the ongoing lava threat. \n \n The Puna Geothermal Venture is owned by Nevada company Ormat Technologies. \n \n It sits on the edge of Leilani Estates, one of the areas where nearly 2,000 residents have been forced to evacuate as Kilauea continues to spew lava. And with new fissures are opening closer to the edge of the plant, residents are getting even more worried. \n \n ___ \n \n 8:20 a.m. \n \n Workers are moving flammable fuel from a geothermal plant that's near a Hawaii community where lava has oozed out of cracks in the ground. \n \n Hawaii County officials say pentane is being moved from Puna Geothermal Venture to an offsite industrial park away from the neighborhoods where lava fissures have emerged. \n \n Scientists say activity from the most recent lava fissure that opened up has paused but dangerous fumes continue to be released. \n \n County officials say as of Thursday 15 fissures have emerged. Some two dozen homes have burned. \n \n There is also concern that Kilauea volcano could soon send boulders and ash shooting out of its summit crater. \n \n Scientists say the explosive eruption could occur even as the volcano continues to splatter and ooze lava out of its eastern flank into a residential area. \n \n Two subdivisions were evacuated last week after lava oozed out of the fissures. \n \n ___ \n \n 12 a.m. \n \n Hawaii's Kilauea volcano could soon send boulders and ash shooting out of its summit crater. That kind of explosive eruption was last displayed by the volcano nearly a century ago. \n \n This eruption could occur even the volcano continues to splatter and ooze lava out of its eastern flank into a residential area. \n \n Scientists said Wednesday the risks of an explosive summit eruption will rise in coming weeks as magma drains down the flank of the volcano. \n \n Hawaii Gov. David Ige says a geothermal energy plant near the lava outbreak would remove its storage of a flammable gas called pentane by the end of the day Thursday. \n \n He says it would be \"very hazardous\" if a volcanic vent were to open under the facility where the fuel is stored. \n \n ___ \n \n This version corrects that the material being moved from the plant is pentane, not pentene, and is in liquid, not gas form.",
    "summary": "\u2013 The ongoing eruption of Hawaii's Kilauea volcano is creating new worries for residents\u2014including the risk of \"vog,\" or volcanic smog. Big Island residents have been warned that a change in the wind is expected to increase the risk of vog, which contains potentially deadly sulfur dioxide gas, Reuters reports. Gov. David Ige has warned that more mass evacuations will be needed as new cracks in the ground send lava and toxic gas into new neighborhoods near the volcano. Ige has asked President Trump to declare a disaster in the state so that federal money can be used in the event of large-scale evacuations by air and sea, the AP reports. Forecasters say Big Island residents are likely to face higher levels of sulfur dioxide Friday, which is especially dangerous for children, the elderly, and those with respiratory conditions, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Trade winds are expected to ease conditions by Saturday morning. Amid fears that the volcano, one of the world's most active, could erupt explosively, flammable pentane has been removed from a geothermal plant near two neighborhoods that had to be evacuated because of lava and gas. Kilauea is surrounded by Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, which closed Thursday night until further notice. Scientists had warned that if the volcano erupts, park visitors within a mile or so of the crater were at risk of being hit by refrigerator-sized boulders.",
