As reddit recently pointed out, that's almost exactly as much as the average American man weighed in the early 1960s. \n \n Men, you're not looking too hot in this scenario either. Over the same time period you gained nearly 30 pounds, from 166.3 in the 60s to 195.5 today. Doing the same comparison as above, today's American man weighs almost as much as 1.5 American women from the 1960s. At 195.5 pounds, put five American guys in a room and you've gathered roughly half a ton of manhood. \n \n Overall weight gain since 1960 is slightly greater for women (18.5 percent) than for men (17.6 percent). And both sexes have gained roughly an inch in height over the same period, which accounts for some of that weight gain. \n \n But story is mostly one of growing girth, and it basically boils down to three factors: we're eating less healthy food, we're eating more of it, and we're not moving around as much.

But if every country had the same weight distribution as the U.S., the world would be 58 million tons fatter, an increase of 20 percent. \n \n The study concludes that \"tackling population fatness may be critical to world food security and ecological sustainability.\" And as with so many of the world's problems, the solutions start at home -- on the bathroom scale in this case. But boy, those donuts sure do look delicious. ||||| Atlanta, Ga. (CBS ATLANTA) \u2014 The average American woman now weighs as much as the average American man weighed in 1960. \n \n Both U.S. men and women have been packing on the pounds since 1960, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that the average American woman now weighs 166.2 pounds \u2013 nearly identical to what American men weighed in the 1960s. And U.S. men have expanded greatly in the same time period, having gained nearly 30 pounds from the 1960s to 2010 \u2013 166.3 pounds to 195.5 pounds today. \n \n The CDC data shows that both sexes have gained almost an inch in height from the 1960s, which factors into some of the overall weight gain. But women have seen an 18.5 percent increase in weight gain from 1960 and men have shown a 17.6 percent increase in overall weight gain. \n \n Today\u2019s American male weighs nearly as much as 1.5 American females from the 1960s, with today\u2019s U.S. male weighing an average 195.5 pounds and having a nearly 40-inch waist circumference (39.7 inches). \n \n American women today have an average waist circumference of 37.5 inches and weigh in at 166.2 pounds, up from about 140 pounds in 1960. \n \n The CDC data shows that more than one-third (35.1 percent) of U.S. adults over the age of 20 are considered obese. And 69 percent of American adults over the age of 20 are either overweight or obese. \n \n More than 1-in-5 U.S. children between the ages of 12-19 are considered obese, with 17.7 percent of kids ages 6-11 also weighing in at obesity levels. \n \n A 2012 study published in the journal MBC Public Health finds that Americans are now the world\u2019s third-heaviest people, trailing only the Pacific Island countries of Tonga and Micronesia. The average U.S. adult is 33 pounds heavier than the average Frenchman and 70 pounds heavier than the average Bangladeshi citizen. To compile a ton of total mass, it would require only 12.2 Americans in a room versus 20 average citizens of Bangladesh. \n \n A 2005 BMC Public Health study revealed that the world\u2019s adult human beings make up 287 million tons of biomass, but if every country was as large as the U.S., Earth would be 58 million tons fatter. \n \n \u2014 Benjamin Fearnow",

Something more than questionable fashion should stand out, according to new data from the CDC, which finds the average weight of a US woman is now 166.2 pounds\u2014about the same weight as the average man in the 1960s\u2014up from about 140 pounds during that time, reports the Washington Post. That's an increase of 18.5%. Men, who weighed 166.3 pounds in the 1960s, now tip the scales at an average of 195.5 pounds, for a 17.6% gain. Is it as bad as it seems? Essentially, yes, though the typical height of men and women has grown by an inch, which at least accounts for something. But the main reasons for our growing bellies are no surprise: Americans are eating more food, but less health food, and are exercising less. The data shows 35% of Americans over 20 are considered obese, while 69% of adults are either overweight or obese, reports CBS Atlanta. As for children, one in five between 12 and 19 and 18% between 6 and 11 are obese. A 2012 study found Americans were the third-heaviest people on the planet behind residents of Tonga and Micronesia. The average American was 33 pounds heavier than a Frenchman, 40 pounds heavier than a citizen of Japan, and 70 pounds heavier than a person in Bangladesh, adds the Post. Dying to get back to that 1960s frame? It's actually more important to watch what you eat rather than exercise constantly, though exercising and eating healthy together is obviously beneficial.

    "document": "FILE - In this Monday, July 19, 2010 file photo, Muqtada al-Sadr, one of Iraq's most powerful Shiite political clerics, speaks to reporters following a meeting with former Iraqi Prime Minister Ayad Allawi... (Associated Press) \n \n A Muslim cleric who once used a militia to resist the American invasion positioned himself as a big winner in Iraq's monthslong political deadlock Friday when his party threw its support behind the beleaguered prime minister. \n \n The hard-line Shiite group led by Muqtada al-Sadr called it the start of its ascent to nationwide power _ a specter sure to spook the United States. \n \n Washington considers the cleric a threat to Iraq's shaky security and has long refused to consider his movement a legitimate political entity. But Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki may be unable to govern without him. \n \n March elections failed to produce a clear winner and left the nation in turmoil _ a power vacuum that U.S. military officials say has encouraged a spike in attacks by Sunni insurgents. \n \n Final agreement on how to form the new government could still be weeks if not months away, but \"the Sadrist acceptance of al-Maliki as prime minister could begin to break the logjam,\" said Iraq expert Daniel Serwer of the U.S. Institute of Peace in Washington. \n \n In a late-night appearance on state-run TV, al-Maliki thanked his fellow Shiite allies for the support that will likely hand him another term as prime minister. \n \n \"I promise them and all beloved Iraqi people that we will take care with the big, heavy responsibility of serving all Iraqis,\" al-Maliki said. \n \n It is still too soon for him to declare victory, however, because his chief rival, former prime minister Ayad Allawi, continues to scramble for support. \n \n Shiite leaders from the Fadhila party and the devout Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council met late Friday night to discuss the political developments with Deputy Prime Minister Rafia al-Issawi, a lawmaker with Allawi's Sunni-dominated Iraqiya coalition. Iraqiya won the most parliament seats in the March 7 vote, narrowly beating al-Maliki's coalition, but neither side has the 163-seat majority needed to control the government outright. \n \n Allying with al-Maliki poses a political risk for al-Sadr among his followers, many of whom hate the prime minister, and the cleric's top aides refused Friday to publicly explain why he did it. The most that Sadrist lawmaker Nassar al-Rubaie would say is that both camps now seek to \"open dialogue with the other winning political groups to form the government.\" \n \n But it is clear to Iraqi and U.S. officials that al-Sadr seeks unfettered and increased influence in the next government if al-Maliki comes out on top. \n \n The cleric, whose militia once ran death squads out of the health ministry headquarters in Baghdad to target Sunnis, has been in self-imposed exile in Iran since 2007. \n \n As part of agreeing to back al-Maliki, a leading Sadrist said the movement has demanded key government positions, including deputy parliament speaker and as many as six Cabinet-level ministry posts of the 34 to be filled. \n \n Controlling service agencies like Iraq's health, oil, construction and electricity ministries would allow Sadrists to hire supporters and boost political loyalty. Sadrists also are clamoring to run the trade ministry, which would carry some sway over foreign policy, and at least one of the agencies tasked with Iraqi security missions _ a huge red flag to U.S. officials. \n \n Down the road, after the American military has fully withdrawn in 2011 and U.S. diplomatic influence has waned, Sadrists will make a play for the prime minister's post, said a leading party official who spoke on condition of anonymity because al-Sadr has forbidden his aides from discussing the negotiations. \n \n \"In the future, the premiership will be for us,\" the Sadrist official said. \"We will have nominees who will compete when the next elections are held after the departure of the (U.S.) occupation.\" \n \n Having a Sadrist in power would endanger if not scuttle hopes of establishing a thriving democracy in Iraq that could be a model in the region. There are worries about how much influence Iran now carries over al-Sadr after offering him refuge for more than three years. \n \n While saying it does not have a favorite candidate among those vying to become prime minister, the Obama administration strongly opposes giving power to al-Sadr and his followers. It is largely a moot wish: Sadrists were the only party to gain seats in parliament in the March 7 vote, winning 39 of the 325 in a signal of their rise. \n \n That has put them in the position of being wooed by other Shiite political leaders for support. \n \n \"The Sadrists having a key role in the next government of Iraq was one of the few redlines that the Obama administration had,\" said Ken Pollack, an expert at the Brookings Institute think-tank in Washington who was a key Iraq policymaker in the Bush administration. \n \n \"They've staged this major comeback, and the administration is very, very worried about that,\" Pollack said. \"This is something Iran has been trying to do for months. Clearly this is a big win for them and really bad for the U.S.\" \n \n In Baghdad, U.S. Embassy spokesman David J. Ranz avoided even using the word Sadrist when asked for an official statement Friday about the movement's partnership with al-Maliki. \n \n Ranz said the embassy welcomed actions that would lead to a new government in Iraq, now stalled for nearly seven months. And he said the U.S. hoped to see \"an inclusive and legitimate government, responsive to the needs of the Iraqi people.\" \n \n Al-Maliki has been scrounging for allies since his political coalition fell short in the election to Iraqiya coalition, which is largely backed by Sunnis and led by Allawi, a Shiite. \n \n Pollack, the U.S. expert, said the deadlock between al-Maliki and Allawi allowed the Sadrists to step into the void. \"They have played their hand really skillfully,\" Pollack said. \n \n Senior Iraqiya lawmaker Osama al-Nujaifi said an al-Sadr alliance with the government \"will definitely complicate the situation.\" \n \n Ultimately, Kurdish parties that hold 43 seats are likely to tip the balance, and they are widely expected to throw their weight behind al-Maliki if they sense he can hold on to his post. \n \n Kurdish leaders who control a semiautonomous northern enclave had no immediate comment Friday, and generally have remained on the sidelines in the political maneuvering. Iraqiya would have to win over not only the Kurds, but also some Shiites, to gain control of the government. \n \n And some prominent Shiites have yet to side with al-Maliki, which could open potentially disruptive rifts as Iraq tries to find a political balance. \n \n Conspicuously absent from Friday's announcement was Shiite cleric Ammar al-Hakim, leader of the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council that was earlier aligned with the Sadrists. Aides to al-Hakim said he and about a dozen followers have not yet decided to back al-Maliki. \n \n Al-Sadr's support for al-Maliki marks a turnabout, and is not likely to be embraced by all of his followers. For months, the group has demanded the prime minister be replaced, and Sadrist rallies routinely call for his death. \n \n In 2008, a joint U.S.-Iraqi offensive broke the grip of al-Sadr's Mahdi Army militia in Baghdad and Basra, routing Shiite death squads that terrorized Sunni neighborhoods and had brought the country to the brink of civil war. \n \n Earlier this week, some Sadrists sent a message to the cleric, asking him why he would support a leader who had fought his army. \n \n Al-Sadr asked them to fall in line. \n \n \"You know the policy is give and take,\" he wrote in an answer posted on his website. \"Our goal is to serve you and lift the oppression on you as much we can. I ask you to stand beside (Sadrist political negotiators). Anyone who stands against them is standing against the private and public interests.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press Writers Saad Abdul-Kadir and Brian Murphy in Baghdad contributed to this report. ||||| BAGHDAD - A coalition of Shiite political blocs chose Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki as its candidate for Iraq's top government job on Friday afternoon - a step that could break a months-long standoff over who will govern the country. \n \n Despite the new support, Maliki must still find more votes in the Iraqi parliament if he is to remain in power and form a new government. The fact that the Shiites now supporting Maliki are mostly Sadrists - followers of radical cleric Moqtada al-Sadr who staunchly oppose the American presence here - also has the potential to alarm Washington. At the same time, the possibility that Maliki might be moving closer to claiming power has alienated others in Iraq and threatens to splinter the broader Shiite alliance. \n \n Attention is likely to shift to the Kurds, who have largely remained on the sidelines during months of negotiations but whose support could be decisive for Maliki. \n \n U.S. officials have urged Iraq's political leaders to break their impasse and form an inclusive government, amid fears that further delay could erode security gains made over the past two years. \n \n But in Washington, a senior Obama administration official said he did not expect Maliki to be able to form a government with the Sadrists and suggested that the agreement may end up accelerating negotiations over a broader-based government. A split among Shiites, with major groups refusing to go along with the Sadrists, leaves Maliki \"still 30 seats short of a majority,\" the official said. \"He needs to deal.\" \n \n The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid the appearance of interfering in internal Iraqi deliberations, said that \"the Kurds are now in the kingmaker position\" and that \"no agreement that I've seen suggests their requirements have been met yet,\" including insistence on the inclusion of elements of the Iraqiya bloc - formed by Maliki's main rival, secular Shiite Ayad Allawi - and other Shiite groups. \n \n Maliki has served as prime minister since 2006 and has remained as a caretaker in that role since the March 7 parliamentary elections. As he tries to assemble the coalition he needs to win the support of a simple majority in the 325-member parliament, he has brushed up against the country's many religious and ethnic factions. \n \n The news of support for Maliki from the Sadrists appeared to expose the limits of the backing he can count on from other Shiite groups within the coalition. Late Friday, at least two smaller Shiite groups were meeting with the Iraqiya bloc and threatened to oppose Maliki's nomination. \n \n \"We have reservations against Maliki, and we want to come to a compromise candidate to form a strong government of national partnership, not a weak one,\" said Ali Shabbar, a leading Shiite legislator from the Shiite Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq. \"Maliki failed in his performance for the last four years, and he gave nothing to the people.\" \n \n The endorsement of Maliki came on the day Iraq broke the record for the longest time between elections and government formation in a parliamentary system. Both Maliki and Allawi claim the right to form the next government, based on differing interpretations of the constitution. Allawi's Iraqiya bloc, backed largely by Sunni Arabs, won 91 seats; Maliki's slate won 89. Iraqiya has threatened to boycott the next government if Maliki becomes prime minister. \n \n Allawi's bloc instead hopes to broker a deal with some of the Shiite groups to nominate an alternative to Maliki. Iraqi officials said the move would be a blow to neighboring Iran, which has been pressuring the Shiite leaders to stay united despite their disputes. \n \n Maliki is a divisive leader. He has made a slew of enemies, who accuse him of being a strongman who circumvented security ministries, consulted a small circle of advisers and ruled with dictatorial tendencies. \n \n The Sadrist support for him came despite a history of enmity toward Maliki, who led a charge against the militant wing of the Sadr movement in 2008 in the southern port city of Basra. In the last two months, hundreds of Sadrists have been released from Iraqi prisons. \n \n With about 57 seats in the parliament, the Kurdish alliance could give Maliki the backing he needs. But Kurdish officials have balked at the possibility that Iraqiya, which represents a large portion of Sunni Arabs, might not be included in Iraq's next government. \n \n If Iraqiya does not participate, the next government might not be seen as credible. Sunni and secular Iraqis cast their ballots in droves for Allawi's group, and Sunnis have felt marginalized by past Shiite-led governments. \n \n \"It's not over until it's over,\" said Hoshyar Zebari, the foreign minister and an elected Kurdish member of Iraq's new parliament. \"Things could get more complicated.\" \n \n Special correspondent Jinan Hussein in Baghdad and staff writer Karen DeYoung in Washington contributed to this report. ||||| \u201cWe are confident that with the cooperation and efforts of honorable and faithful Iraqis, we will, God willing, be able to overcome the difficulties, challenges and problems and complete the construction of the institutions of state of a free, democratic Iraq,\u201d Mr. Maliki said in televised remarks. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n He owes his new support to the extraordinary political resurrection of Moktada al-Sadr, the self-exiled cleric whose fighters once battled in the streets of Baghdad, Basra and other cities with Iraqi and American troops. Until days ago he fiercely opposed Mr. Maliki\u2019s re-election. \n \n Mr. Maliki\u2019s success reflected his tenacity \u2014 tinged with authoritarianism \u2014 to retain power, despite widespread opposition to his leadership. It also showed his willingness to disregard \u2014 for political expediency \u2014 American concerns about the return of Mr. Sadr\u2019s followers to the center of political power. \n \n A dour, uncharismatic leader, Mr. Maliki has persisted in arguing that only he can prevent a descent into the sectarian carnage that consumed Iraq when he took office in 2006, even if that means allying with a movement blamed for much of the violence. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n While Obama administration officials insisted over months of quiet diplomacy that they preferred no candidate, only a broadly inclusive government, they made it clear that they did not favor a government that included the Sadrists, who are closely allied with Iran and oppose the presence of American troops. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n This week, a senior American military commander in Baghdad blamed Shiite extremist groups, including one affiliated with Mr. Sadr, for a spike in rocket attacks on the capital\u2019s Green Zone. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n In Washington, officials were noticeably cool to news of the agreement between Mr. Maliki and Mr. Sadr, in no small part because it signaled an ascendant Iranian influence in Iraq. \n \n \u201cAn Iraqi government that owes its existence to the Sadrists and lacks strong support from Allawi would necessarily be one that leans in Tehran\u2019s direction, something Washington can little afford at the moment,\u201d Daniel P. Serwer, a vice president at the United States Institute of Peace, said in an e-mail. \n \n Mr. Maliki, who is 60, now has the backing of at least 148 lawmakers in the new 325-member Parliament to form a government, just short of a majority. The Kurds, with 57 seats among several parties, indicated Friday that they, too, would support his re-election, though only with concessions on territorial, economic and political issues. \n \n Photo \n \n \u201cNow he has a great possibility to become prime minister again,\u201d said a prominent Kurdish lawmaker, Mahmoud Othman. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n That would give Mr. Maliki a solid majority, though he must still cobble together a governing coalition among various parties jockeying for control of important positions and ministries, especially those overseeing oil and the security forces. \n \n \u201cWhat happened now is the best for Iraqis,\u201d said a leader of Mr. Maliki\u2019s party, Ali al-Adeeb. \n \n He called for a swift session of Parliament to elect Mr. Maliki and pledged to continue talks to include other factions, especially Mr. Allawi\u2019s, which includes almost all of the newly elected Sunni lawmakers.

Whatever the motivation of these critics\u2014and frankly it boggles the mind\u2014the truth is on our side. These are the facts. \n \n For press inquiries contact thehuntingground@kivvit.com. \n \n Kamilah Willingham\u2019s Story \n \n The Assault \n \n On January 16, 2011, third-year Harvard Law student Kamilah Willingham (KW) reported to the Harvard Office of Sexual Assault and Responses that she and her friend (AB) were sexually assaulted during the early morning hours of January 15, 2011 by fellow Harvard Law student Brandon Winston (BW). On January 18, 2011, Willingham filed a report regarding the assault allegations with Cambridge Police. \n \n The Harvard Law Investigation and Adjudication \n \n On April 18, 2011, Willingham filed a complaint with the Administrative Board of Harvard Law School, alleging that Winston violated the Law School\u2019s policy and guidelines related to sexual harassment. The Board appointed an independent Fact Finder, an attorney, to investigate her claim. \n \n On August 10, 2011, the Fact Finder released a report that found that Winston \u201cwas not credible\u201d in regard to his version of the sexual contact with both Willingham and her friend, and that Willingham did not give affirmative consent to Winston to engage in sexual conduct with him. From the Fact Finder\u2019s Report: \n \n \u201cHis [Winston\u2019s] denial was not credible.\u201d \n \n \u201cBW\u2019s actions in undressing AB, touching her body, rubbing her crotch, and inserting his finger in AB\u2019s vagina, when she was incapacitated by alcohol intoxication, was abusive and unreasonably invasive.\u201d \n \n \u201cBW\u2019s explanation that he believed AB welcomed the sexual conduct is not reasonable or credible.\u201d \n \n \u201cThe Fact Finder finds the evidence compelling, and finds that BW could not reasonably have believed that his sexual conduct toward AB at KW\u2019s apartment was welcome.\u201d \n \n \u201cBW changed his account at least two times.\u201d \n \n \u201cBW did not appear credible when providing the explanations, and they do not offer a reasonable explanation for his statement that he put \u2018a finger briefly in the v at most\u2019 or for his later retraction.\u201d \n \n On September 19, 2011, the Harvard Law Administrative Board conducted a hearing on Willingham\u2019s complaint against Winston. After reviewing all of the evidence, the Board found the following: \n \n \u201cThe student [Winston] had initiated sexual conduct with the complainant while she was asleep or unconscious, and not capable of consenting.\u201d \n \n \u201cHe [Winston] had initiated sexual contact with the friend while she was incapable of consenting.\u201d \n \n \u201cThe student\u2019s [Winston\u2019s] conduct toward the complainant was unwelcome and abusive or invasive, and that it had the effect of unreasonably interfering with her work or academic performance and/or created an intimidating, demeaning, degrading, hostile or otherwise seriously offensive working or educational environment at Harvard Law School.\u201d \n \n As a result, on September 21, 2011, the Board imposed a sanction of dismissal on Winston. \n \n The Appeal \n \n Harvard Law initiated a required appeal of Winston\u2019s dismissal in the Spring of 2012. The flawed appeal process violated a number of Title IX guidelines, and Harvard was later forced to change its policies in a settlement with the Department of Education. As a part of the appeal process, Harvard Law faculty voted to overturn the findings of both the Independent Fact Finder and the Administrative Board and reinstated Willingham\u2019s assailant. The appeal process included the following actions: \n \n Harvard Law initiated a Review Hearing without informing Willingham or including her in the process, a direct violation of Title IX guidelines. \n \n The Hearing Officer for the appeal process interviewed the accused (with his lawyer present), but did not interview Willingham, violating Title IX guidelines. \n \n The Hearing Officer was one of the accused\u2019s professors. When Willingham later asked the Harvard Law dean in an email about the professional and personal relationship of the accused and the Hearing Officer, the dean refused to disclose that relationship. \n \n The Review Hearing upheld the Administrative Board\u2019s sanction of dismissal. \n \n Despite the fact that the Review Hearing only included Winston\u2019s testimony, an assembly of Harvard Law faculty full professors proceeded with their review and voted to overturn the findings and decisions of the Independent Fact Finder, the Administrative Board, and the Hearing Officer. This process was in direct violation of Title IX guidelines. \n \n Willingham was not notified of the appeal decision until months after the accused was notified (another violation of Title IX guidelines) and after the accused had returned to Harvard law where Willingham was still enrolled. \n \n Harvard Law refused to inform Willingham of who was present at the Harvard Law faculty vote, what the vote count was, or what the specific reason was for overturning the finding. \n \n The dean of Harvard Law refused to give Willingham a written or digital copy of the decision to overturn the findings. \n \n The Department of Education Investigates \n \n In the 2014 settlement agreement of the Title IX complaint between the Department of Education (DOE) and Harvard Law School, Harvard Law was required to change its appeal process. The DOE chose to highlight only one case (without identifying names) in their press release about why Harvard had to change its appeal process. Every indication is that the case was Kamilah Willingham\u2019s. \n \n The Criminal Process \n \n In September 2012, prosecutors from the Middlesex District Attorney\u2019s Office presented six possible charges to a Middlesex Superior Court grand jury. The grand jury indicted Winston on two felony counts of indecent assault and battery (the equivalent of felony sexual assault) against Willingham\u2019s friend. In March 2015, a jury convicted Winston for non-sexual assault. \n \n Statistics \n \n 1 in 5 women are sexually assaulted while in college \n \n A multitude of national and individual school studies over the past fifteen years have come to the universal conclusion that approximately 20% of female students will be sexually assaulted during their time at college. \n \n The large, national The Washington Post-Kaiser Poll (2015) found that 20% of young women who attended college during the past four years were sexually assaulted. \n \n A study commissioned by the Association of American Universities (2015) surveyed 150,000 students at 27 colleges and universities across the country and found that 27.2% of female college seniors reported they had experienced some kind of unwanted sexual contact since entering college. \n \n England (2015) : A national survey of more than 20,000 students from 21 four-year colleges found that 25% of college women were sexually assaulted. \n \n Kilpatrick (2007) A national sample representing women currently attending U.S. colleges and universities found that 11.5% have been raped. \n \n Fisher (2000): A national sample of 4,446 women found that 20-25% were sexually assaulted. \n \n Outreach to Universities \n \n The filmmakers reached out to the presidents of every college and university mentioned in the film. Two university presidents were interviewed for the film, and thirty-five college or university presidents declined to speak or did not respond. \n \n Erica Kinsman\u2019s Story \n \n The Assault \n \n Early in the morning of December 7, 2012, Florida State University student Erica Kinsman reported to the police that she was raped several hours earlier by an unknown man after drinking a Potbelly\u2019s, a popular local bar. \n \n Investigative Timeline \n \n A thorough examination of the police investigation of Kinsman\u2019s rape by The New York Times found that \u201cthere was virtually no investigation at all, either by the police or the university\u201d into the events that occurred on the night of December 7th, 2012. According to the Times, investigators showed little interest in finding out what happened on the night of Erica Kinsman\u2019s rape. They \u201cdelayed talking to witnesses, interviewing Jameis Winston (the accused) and collecting his DNA.\u201d The following timeline details how long it took police to gather key evidence and FSU\u2019s failure to investigate Kinsman\u2019s report of sexual assault. \n \n 12/7/12 \u2013 Erica Kinsman, a Florida State University student, reported to the Florida State Police and the Tallahassee Police Department that she was raped several hours earlier by an unknown man after drinking at Potbelly\u2019s, a popular local bar. Police took Kinsman to the Tallahassee Memorial Hospital where a rape kit was administered and bruises were noted in Kinsman\u2019s medical record. The police didn\u2019t act on information provided by Kinsman, and failed to obtain and review the video camera footage at Potbelly\u2019s, locate the cab driver who drove them from the bar, or interview critical witnesses, all of which would have aided investigators in identifying Kinsman\u2019s assailant. \n \n 1/10/13 \u2013 The police failed to identify Winston until 34 days after Kinsman\u2019s initial report, learning his identity only after Kinsman recognized him in class and informed the police. Police waited nearly two weeks to contact Winston after Kinsman identified him as her assailant. \n \n 1/22/13 \u2013 FSU Head Football Coach Jimbo Fisher and Senior Associate Athletics Director Monk Bonasorte learned that Winston had been accused of rape. Both were obligated by FSU policy and the U.S. Department of Education to report this to FSU\u2019s Title IX Coordinator so that they could begin an investigation, but did not. \n \n 1/23/13 \u2013 The Tallahassee police contacted the accused after waiting nearly two weeks. Winston did not show up for the requested interview. Instead, his attorney appeared at the Tallahassee police station on his behalf. \n \n 2/11/13 \u2013 The Tallahassee police closed the case 66 days after Kinsman reported her rape, without interviewing Winston and crucial witnesses (one of whom videotaped part of the sexual encounter) or getting DNA or phone records from Winston. The investigative officer, Detective Angulo, had worked for the Seminole Boosters, the fundraising arm for FSU athletics. The officer\u2019s report states that he suspended the investigation because the accuser was uncooperative, which she denies. \n \n 10/25/13 \u2013 Kinsman notified her victims advocate that she wanted to participate in FSU code of conduct proceedings for a Title IX investigation of her case. \n \n 11/12/13 \u2013 FSU Dean of Students Jeanine Ward-Roof and FSU Police Chief Perry learned that a second FSU student had accused Winston of sexual assault. Ward-Roof emailed FSU Policy Chief Perry that there would be no disciplinary proceedings against Winston for either assault, a direct violation of school policy and U.S. Department of Education guidelines. \n \n 11/13/13 \u2013 The State\u2019s Attorney Office of the 2nd Judicial Circuit began an investigation into Kinsman\u2019s assault. \n \n 11/14/13 \u2013 Investigators interviewed key witnesses and obtained DNA samples from the accused 342 days after the initial complaint was reported. For the first time, investigators interviewed two teammates of Winston\u2019s who claimed to have witnessed sex between Winston and Kinsman. Investigators also obtained Winston\u2019s DNA, which matched DNA found on Kinsman\u2019s clothing. \n \n 12/5/13 \u2013 The State\u2019s Attorney Office announced they were not charging Winston. The Tallahassee police investigation is closed. \n \n 1/23/14 \u2013 More than one year after FSU officials were made aware that Winston was accused of rape, FSU finally meets with him regarding the Kinsman case. him. Winston refuses to answer any questions. FSU does not meet with Kinsman. \n \n 2/10/14 \u2013 FSU closes the case (even though they still had not interviewed Kinsman) because Winston refused to speak with them. \n \n 12/5/14 \u2013 Nearly two years after the report of rape, FSU held a hearing regarding Kinsman\u2019s case, even though the Department of Education strongly recommends that any accusation of sexual assault be investigated and resolved within 60 days. \n \n During the hearing, Kinsman answered all 156 questions asked of her. Winston refused to answer all of the questions asked of him except three. This was the exchange: \n \n Justice Harding: And I would like to know in what manner, verbally or physically, that she gave consent. And I ask that with the understanding that you have previously given. \n \n Winston: Both, your honor, verbally and physically. \n \n Justice Harding: And what did she say and what did she do? \n \n Winston: Moaning is mostly physically. Well, moaning is physically. And verbally at that time, Your Honor. \n \n Justice Harding: Well, that was during the sexual encounter? \n \n Winston: Yes, Your honor. \n \n Justice Harding: Okay. All right. Thank you. ||||| On their website, Mr. Dick and Ms. Ziering dismiss critics of the film, saying, \u201cThe truth is on our side.\u201d In a statement on Sunday afternoon, they said: \u201cWe were not surprised by the lengths Mr. Winston and his lawyer were willing to go to stop the public from seeing this film. When documentaries bring to light uncomfortable truths about powerful people and institutions, it\u2019s not unusual for them to wage aggressive campaigns to silence their critics. We fully stand behind Erica Kinsman and all of the survivors who bravely spoke out in our film.\u201d Ms. Kinsman is Mr. Winston\u2019s accuser. \n \n Mr. Winston\u2019s threat of legal action came a week after 19 Harvard professors attacked \u201cThe Hunting Ground,\u201d saying it distorted the university\u2019s handling of a sexual assault claim. The accusation eventually resulted in a conviction for misdemeanor nonsexual assault against a student, Brandon Winston, who was not named in the film, but was named in the professors\u2019 letter. Late last week, Brandon Winston\u2019s defense team and supporters unveiled an elaborate website that explains their view of his actions and takes \u201cThe Hunting Ground\u201d to task for what it calls \u201ccritical omissions and distortions.\u201d \n \n Mr. Dick and Ms. Ziering last week challenged the Harvard professors\u2019 action in a text message to The New York Times. It said, in part: \u201cEverything in \u2018The Hunting Ground\u2019 is accurate and we fully stand behind our Harvard Law survivor\u2019s account of her assault, as well as the accounts of all the subjects in our film.\u201d \n \n Escalating denunciation of \u201cThe Hunting Ground\u201d comes as the movie is being considered by members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for a so-called short list of 15 documentary feature Oscar contenders, which will be released next month. The film\u2019s critics have also had an eye on the large viewership CNN may bring to a film that found only a tiny audience in theaters when released in February by the Weinstein Company\u2019s digitally oriented Radius-TWC unit. \n \n As of March, for instance, another controversial documentary, \u201cBlackfish,\u201d about the treatment of whales in captivity, had been seen by about 27 million viewers on CNN, though it had just $2 million in ticket sales when Magnolia Pictures released it in 2013. ||||| Jameis Winston says he's prepared to sue if the cable news network goes ahead and airs the documentary accusing him of rape. \n \n Two days before CNN is set to debut The Hunting Ground, an attorney for former Florida State University and current Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston is warning the cable news network that its documentary about college campus rapes is defamatory. \n \n \"We are writing to formally caution CNN that the portions of the film 'The Hunting Ground' pertaining to Mr. Winston are false and defamatory to Mr. Winston,\" states a letter to CNN's Jeff Zucker, obtained by The Hollywood Reporter. \"We urge CNN to reconsider the reckless decision to proceed with the broadcast of this deeply-flawed documentary in the face of the overwhelming evidence the film's producers consciously and intentionally failed to adhere to any accepted journalistic standards.\" \n \n Winston was accused of rape by Erica Kinsman during the football player's Heisman Trophy season. The Tallahasee Police Department and FSU conducted a much-criticized investigation and took no action against Winston, who was selected first overall in the NFL draft this past May and in the midst of his rookie season. \n \n As Kinsman and Winston duel with each other in court \u2014 she's suing him for sexual battery, he's brought counterclaims for tarnishing his image \u2014 The Hunting Ground has lurked in the background after premiering at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year. \n \n Directed by Kirby Dirk and produced by Amy Ziering, Hunting Ground spotlights Kinsman coming forward to speak publicly for the first time about what Winston allegedly did to her, as well as the ensuing investigations. At Sundance, the film was warmly received, but it's since been attacked as unfair in some circles. \n \n Winston's letter from attorney John Boudet alleges that the film \"manipulates, misstates or simply omits facts to present a false narrative,\" that the filmmakers omitted exculpatory evidence like toxicology tests, medical examinations and eyewitness testimony, and also that Amy Herdy, one of the film's producers, admitted in one email that the film is \"in the corner of advocacy for victims\" with \"no need to get the perpetrator's side.\" \n \n FSU has voiced its own complaints and asked CNN not to air the film, but Winston goes much further. \n \n \"CNN may have persuaded itself that Mr. Winston's status as a public figure insulates your company from a libel judgment,\" states the letter. \"If CNN decides to proceed with this broadcast, we will perhaps have the opportunity to test that legal proposition in a court of law.\" \n \n On Saturday morning, filmmakers Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering issued the following statement to THR: \"We fully stand behind Erica Kinsman\u2019s account, and the accounts of all the subjects in our film. When documentaries bring to light uncomfortable truths about powerful people and institutions, it's not unusual for them to wage aggressive campaigns to silence their critics.

It ran as scheduled. \n \n In the film, Erica Kinsman accuses Winston of committing sexual assault during his time on the football team at Florida State University, a claim his lawyer says is defamatory. \n \n In a letter to CNN first obtained by The Hollywood Reporter, lawyer John Boudet says the film \"manipulates, misstates or simply omits facts to present a false narrative\": \n \n \"We urge CNN to reconsider the reckless decision to proceed with the broadcast of this deeply-flawed documentary in the face of the overwhelming evidence the film's producers consciously and intentionally failed to adhere to any accepted journalistic standards.\" \n \n The documentary, which was shown at the Sundance Film Festival, argues women are at serious risk of sexual assault on college campuses and many college administrators have repeatedly tried to sweep the problem under the rug to avoid public relations problems. \n \n Kinsman has filed a lawsuit against Winston, accusing him of forcible rape in 2012. He was not charged by police in Florida and is now starting for the Buccaneers. \n \n Kinsman's lawyer, John Clune, issued a statement over the weekend saying Winston had launched a \"PR battle\": \n \n \"His latest attack is an attempt to revive his lawyers' media themes and, as expected, shows no understanding of rape trauma and misrepresents the actual evidence. More importantly, Mr. Winston should get used to the rape allegations against him because film or no film, they aren't going away.\" \n \n CNN made clear it would go ahead with plans to air the documentary. \n \n \"CNN is proud to provide a platform for a film that has undeniably played a significant role in advancing the national conversation about sexual assault on college campuses,\" a network spokeswoman told The New York Times. \"We are confident that both the film and our extensive associated coverage give this important issue the full and fair treatment it deserves.\" \n \n The Hunting Ground has also been criticized for its depiction of an incident at Harvard Law School, in which a student was accused of assaulting two women. \n \n A letter signed by 19 Harvard Law School faculty members said the film \"provides a seriously false picture both of the general sexual assault phenomenon at universities and of our student,\" noting a grand jury declined to indict him on the most serious sexual assault charges brought against him. \n \n The documentary makers say they stand behind the case as they presented it.",

    "document": "\u201cThe Giver\u201d was ahead of its time as a book. But as a movie, it\u2019s too late. \n \n Published in 1993, Lois Lowry\u2019s young-adult novel was a deeply felt, kid-centered dystopian fantasy. Its world of children learning what their \u201cperfect\u201d society had lost was both archetypal yet new. \n \n But on screen, 21 years later, \u201cThe Giver\u201d will feel too familiar after two editions of \u201cThe Hunger Games,\u201d as well as \u201cEnder\u2019s Game\u201d and \u201cDivergent\u201d \u2014 plus \u201cThe Maze Runner\u201d and the third \u201cHunger Games\u201d coming later this year. \n \n As a result, \u201cThe Giver\u201d is a bland also-ran in a world it helped create. \n \n The story is set in our distant future. To avoid war, humans built solitary communities that follow restrictive but polite rules. \u201cSameness\u201d is crucial (art, love and animals are not). \n \n \u201cParental units\u201d can apply for one boy and one girl. At 18, after being watched their whole lives by omnipresent elders and their leader (Meryl Streep), kids are assigned a job for life. (The elderly have an annual ceremony of being \u201creleased to Elsewhere,\u201d a euphemism for death.) \n \n Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) is chosen to be the community\u2019s new Receiver \u2014 the one person allowed to have books, and the person designated to receive all the memories of what the world was like before the antiseptic civility. To learn it, Jonas becomes the apprentice to the Giver (Jeff Bridges), the elder who possesses all the world\u2019s collective memories. Jonas is chosen because he sees things differently, like the red hair of Fiona (Odeya Rush), a girl he likes. \n \n Brenton Thwaites and Odeya Rush exist in a conformist society in \u2018The Giver.\u2019 (David Bloomer) Jeff Bridges and Taylor Swift in \u2018The Giver\u2019 (David Bloomer) Katie Holmes and Alexander Skarsgard in \u2018The Giver\u2019 (David Bloomer) Jeff Bridges mentors Brenton Thwaites in \u2018The Giver.\u2019 (twc) \n \n The Giver shares with Jonas memories of snow and rainbows, of dissent and bravery, of cruelty and war and love. When Jonas wants to tell his friends about how the world used to be \u2014 and save a newborn boy from being killed \u2014 he makes his first real choice. \n \n Director Philip Noyce\u2019s decision to (mostly) avoid the slam-bang action scenes or banal romance of other blockbusters is laudable. Through Bridges\u2019 gruff but appealing guidance, young audiences may become aware of touchstones \u2014 Nelson Mandela, for example, or Tiananmen Square, both of which are glimpsed in the Giver\u2019s memory \u2014 that they might normally have tuned out. \n \n But that doesn\u2019t mean the film works as it should. The \u201cBrave New World\u201d/\u201cLogan\u2019s Run\u201d society it depicts seems to have influenced the acting, most notably of Katie Holmes, who we can guess was channeling memories of Scientology to play Jonas\u2019 dutiful mother. \n \n Streep, meanwhile is an angry matriarch figure, but she\u2019s wasted in an underwritten role. Taylor Swift pops up in an unnecessary cameo as a previous Receiver who didn\u2019t work out. \n \n Like the character of the Giver, this is the elder YA tale the others learned from. Too bad the movie is less than the sum of its parts. \n \n jneumaier@nydailynews.com \n \n Sign up for BREAKING NEWS Emails privacy policy Thanks for subscribing! ||||| CLOSE In a seemingly perfect community, without war, pain, suffering, differences or choice, a young boy is chosen to learn from an elderly man about the true pain and pleasure of the \"real\" world. \n \n Philip Noyce's film, based on the much-loved Lois Lowry young-adult novel, boasts a good cast but falls flat on the screen. \n \n Brenton Thwaites in a scene from \u201cThe Giver.\u201d (Photo: On Screen Entertainment) Story Highlights Critic's review: 2 stars \n \n The cast is game but given little to do. \n \n It's not a bad movie, just one that falls flat. \n \n In a crowd of young-adult works about dystopian futures, the film doesn't stand out. \n \n The future doesn't look bright. \n \n Not if you judge by movies based on young-adult novels, anyway. Whether it's \"The Hunger Games\" or \"Divergent\" or now \"The Giver,\" one would surmise that we are heading toward a dystopian future in which various of our freedoms will be curtailed or taken away completely. It'll be up to a teenager to save the day, or at least bridge the gap between sequels. \n \n \"The Giver,\" a rather lackluster, too-obvious effort, is no different in any of those regards. Based on the much-loved, oft-taught book by Lois Lowry, director Phillip Noyce's film is set in a near future that would seem to be a utopia. There is no pain, no war, no class distinction. Everything is black and white. No joke; the scenes at the beginning of the film are monochrome. \n \n Of course, there is also no freedom of choice, or freedom of anything, really. No love, no romance, no hugging and kissing. Makes you wonder where all the people come from. Everyone dresses in the same drab, white outfits. All the kids ride the same kind of clunky, white, one-speed bicycles. (Hills seem to have been removed from the equation.) Mention words like \"love\" and you get smacked down with a \"precision of language!\" admonition. \n \n Brenton Thwaities and Odeya Rush star in a scene from \u201cThe Giver.\u201d (Photo: On Screen Entertainment) \n \n Once a year there is a ceremony in which all of the kids who are becoming adults are assigned jobs by the Chief Elder (Meryl Streep, no less). They have no say in the matter, of course; it's all decided for them by the Elders. Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) awaits anxiously as his friends Fiona (Odeya Rush) and Asher (Cameron Monaghan) are given their jobs. \n \n Jonas won't get one. He is chosen to be the Receiver of Memory. He alone will know man's real history, with all of its ugliness and \u2014 duh \u2014 beauty, and will use this wisdom to help the Elders run the place. The current Receiver (Jeff Bridges) thus becomes the Giver; during sessions at his bunker-like library (the only books left in society are housed here), he passes everything, good and bad, to Jonas. \n \n These scenes are among the film's strongest. It's a crash course in what a 15-year-old would probably string together as history's most important events, along with life's experiences. Flowers bloom, people die. They could have said \"circle of life\" and been done with it, but Disney would doubtless protest. \n \n Whatever the case, the visual mash-up as Jonas receives the information (by clasping hands with the Giver) is exciting, if somewhat rushed. (There's a lot of history to cover, if you're going for all of mankind.) \n \n Jonas begins to see in color, and to realize that maybe this seemingly perfect society isn't so perfect after all. What transpires deviates from the book but surprise anyone who has seen this type of movie before (and, given the glut of them, that group probably includes ... I don't know, every girl 16 and younger, probably). \n \n Jeff Bridges and Brenton Thwaities star in a scene from \u201cThe Giver.\u201d (Photo: On Screen Entertainment) \n \n The cast is good but not given much to do in terms of real acting. Alexander Skarsgard is so muted as Jonas' father, for instance, that he's practically somnambulant. Katie Holmes, as Jonas' super-strict mother, meanwhile, is ... well, Katie Holmes. \n \n This isn't a terrible movie. It just falls flat, in almost every way. It exists and not much else. \n \n It's all too predictable, and way too heavy-handed. Movies like this don't trust their audience enough, as opposed to, say, \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\" or \"The Spectacular Now,\" two young-adult films based on books that let their audiences discover what they're trying to say, instead of hitting them over the head with it. \n \n For \"The Giver,\" you might as well wear a helmet. \n \n Review: 'The Giver,' 2 stars \n \n Director: Philip Noyce. \n \n Cast: Brenton Thwaites, Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep. \n \n Rating: PG-13 for a mature thematic image and some sci-fi action/violence. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://azc.cc/Vnb9w8 ||||| 2 out of 4 stars Written by Michael Mitnick and Robert B. Weide Directed by Phillip Noyce Starring Brenton Thwaites, Meryl Streep and Jeff Bridges Classification PG Country USA Language English Year 2014 \n \n Another week, another movie about a special adolescent who saves society from the forces of darkness. Lois Lowry's popular 1993 novel, The Giver, was a trendsetter in the juvenile dystopia genre, but 21 years later, in the wake of The Hunger Games, Divergent and The Lego Movie, another movie about a kid rebelling against socially imposed \"sameness\" is a case of the same old, same old. \n \n Lowry's slender 180-page book, which spawned three sequels, offered a middle-school readership the grim pleasures of the totalitarian fictions of George Orwell, Aldous Huxley and Ray Bradbury, and the novel became a curriculum favourite. The Giver was also frequently banished from reading lists by conservative parents' groups who objected to material they considered too mature and ethically ambiguous. The movie version, adapted by screenwriters Michael Mitnick and Robert Weide, puts those concerns to rest. \n \n The novel's 12-year-old protagonist, Jonas, is now a teenager (played by poster-boy-handsome 25-year-old Australian actor Brenton Thwaites), and the movie's conclusion has all the ambiguity of a sparkly Christmas card. \n \n Story continues below advertisement \n \n Jonas lives in a closed community on a cloud-ringed plain, surrounded by the off-limits \"Elsewhere.\" Books, music, weather, even memories and colour, have somehow been stripped from daily life. The first half-hour is shot in flat black and white, with elements of colour leaking into the frames gradually, as Jonas's consciousness expands. In Gary Ross's 1998 film Pleasantville, that technique was mischievously charming; here it's a blunt metaphor. \n \n The community where Jonas lives resembles a well-regulated campus or gated resort, with boxy modern houses, fountains and manicured lawns. He lives with his assigned family unit, a mild-mannered father (Alexander Skarsgard), tensely proper mother (Katie Holmes) and little sister Lily (Emma Tremblay). They share \"feelings\" every night, and begin each day with an injection to maintain \"sameness.\" Each year, the big event is a ceremony where the Chief Elder (Meryl Streep, looking like an aging hippie in long hair and bangs) assigns a new group of graduates their life work. Jonas's friend Asher (Cameron Monaghan) becomes a pilot, while the pretty girl, Fiona (Odeya Rush), will become a caregiver. \n \n Jonas has a special role: He will become the Receiver, the sole member of his generation allowed to know the group's collective history, and to offer advice to the elders' council. For his training, he goes to the edge of the known world and meets the Giver, an old man in a cottage played by Jeff Bridges, speaking in orotund tones. Bridges, who spent 18 years trying to get this film made (he originally intended his role to be played by his late father, Lloyd Bridges), brings a world-weary crackpot charisma to the part, but he can't really rescue a film that's undermined by self-righteous gaucheness. The Giver's interactions with Jonas set off all kinds of unintended alarm bells: intimate contact, wrist-grabbing, talk of pain, secrecy and giving and receiving. \n \n If their data-transmitting encounters eventually prove to be benign, they're also banal, as Lowry's serious but simplified ideas get reduced to a barrage of visual kitsch. Some images are innocuous (a sleigh ride, folk dancing) but the memory flashes graduate to a reel of world events (Vietnam, Berlin Wall, Tiananmen Square) that feels like a parody of a CNN promo. \n \n As Jonas learns about the joys and horrors of the past, he also has his eyes opened to the falseness of the world he lives in, a loveless system where unwanted babies and old people are euphemistically \"released\" (it sounds like a Tea Party paranoid fantasy of Obamacare). Eventually, in the film's third act, director Phillip Noyce gets a chance to show off his action chops with a chase scene across wild terrain involving fancy drone airplanes, cross-cutting dramatic scenes of Jonas's escape with violent events on the home front. In the process, the movie jettisons the eerie uncertainty of Lowry's novel, which ended where an adolescent story should \u2013 at the edge of the unknown. ||||| \u201cThe Giver\u201d brings to life Lois Lowry\u2019s 1993 novel about a dystopian community.

And, according to the Post's Ann Hornaday, if you liked the book, you'll like the movie adaptation. (Jayne W. Orenstein/The Washington Post) \n \n \u201cThe Giver,\u201d an adaptation of Lois Lowry\u2019s Newbery Medal-winning young adult novel, may seem like it\u2019s riding on the coattails of such dystopian action hits as \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d and \u201cDivergent.\u201d But in reality, Lowry\u2019s book may qualify as the ur-text of the form, a slim, futuristic allegory that, since it was published in 1993, has sold more than 10 million copies. \n \n In its own way, the movie version \u2014 handsomely directed by Phillip Noyce and featuring an appealing, sure-footed cast of emerging and veteran actors \u2014 aptly reflects \u201cThe Giver\u2019s\u201d pride of place as the one that started it all, or at least the latest wave. Ironically, it wasn\u2019t until its imitators became box office bonanzas that \u201cThe Giver\u201d was seen potentially profitable enough to produce for the big screen. Far less noisy and graphically violent than those films, this mournful coming-of-age tale feels like their more subdued and introspective older sibling, even as it trafficks in the self-dramatizing emotionalism and simplistic philosophizing that are so recognizably symptomatic of the YA genre. \n \n Set in an indeterminate future long after a vaguely drawn catastrophe called The Ruin, \u201cThe Giver\u201d chronicles the story of Jonas (Brenton Thwaites), a teenager who has grown up in the Communities, where the all-seeing, all-hearing Council of Elders controls everything from domestic arrangements and careers to climate and sexual \u201cstirrings,\u201d which are carefully regulated by way of daily morning injections. \n \n Jonas\u2019s world, which he navigates with his best friends, Fiona (the stunning Israeli actress Odeya Rush) and Asher (Cameron Monaghan), is one in which all conflict, hatred and distinction has been erased by cultural values of conformity and obedience. This is a literally color-blind society, its black-and-white contours reflecting not only the Elders\u2019 monotonously authoritarian sensibility, but Lowry\u2019s own conveniently Manichean imagination, in which emotions and empiricism are at constant zero-sum odds. \n \n As \u201cThe Giver\u201d begins, Jonas and his contemporaries are about to find out what jobs they\u2019ve been assigned by the chief Elder, played by Meryl Streep in a long gray wig that recalls Holly Hunter\u2019s blunt-spoken separatist leader in the series \u201cTop of the Lake.\u201d It turns out that Jonas \u2014 who, unlike his friends and family, is able to see color \u2014 has been chosen to be a Receiver of Memory, meaning that he will soon learn all that happened before the world became the reassuringly predictable and consistent bubble in which he grew up. \n \n Jeff Bridges and Brenton Thwaites in \u201cThe Giver,\u201d an adaptation of the young adult novel by Lois Lowry. (The Weinstein Company) \n \n His guide in this endeavor is the title character of \u201cThe Giver,\u201d a bearded sage living in an isolated mountaintop aerie played with shamanic gruffness by Jeff Bridges. As it happens, Bridges himself was the prime engine in getting \u201cThe Giver\u201d made after a decades-long struggle, during which he intended that his father, Lloyd, play the part he ultimately took as his own. That commitment and seriousness of purpose suffuse a production that will surely please the millions of people who read \u201cThe Giver\u201d in middle school, and for whom it became much more than a good book and more like a potent talisman of their own emerging notions of individuation, moral choice and transcendent self-sacrifice. \n \n Although Jonas is only 12 in the book, in the filmed version of \u201cThe Giver\u201d he is 16 \u2014 and played by an Australian in his mid-20s, a digression from novelistic detail that has already sent Lowry\u2019s partisans into howls of how-dare-they distress. But Thwaites, who was recently seen as a handsome prince in \u201cMaleficent,\u201d acquits himself well in a role that makes the most of his sober, Gary Cooper-esque good looks. Filmed in silvery tones of black and white, \u201cThe Giver\u201d gradually gives way to a color scheme that is lurid or muted, depending on what experiences Jonas is accessing with the help of his grizzled mentor. \n \n Although those memories will eventually send him on a genuine physical ad\u00adven\u00adture, replete with a shattering revelation and high-stakes drone chase, most of the film traces a young man\u2019s dawning awareness that, the ease and peacefulness of his world notwithstanding, there\u2019s something frighteningly toxic at its core. (One quibble with \u201cThe Giver\u201d is that, at a sleek hour-and-a-half, some of its most dramatically ripe scenes play too quickly and perfunctorily to convey the impact they\u2019re having on Jonas; no sooner has he witnessed an unspeakable horror than it swiftly disappears, filed away in his burgeoning internal archive.) \n \n Like its fellow YA movies \u2014 which with the current juggernaut of comic-book adaptations represent the dominant culture in Hollywood \u2014 \u201cThe Giver\u201d perceptively caters to its teenaged fans\u2019 own cardinal desires and anxieties. Messy feelings, youthful curiosity and unruly physical impulses are valorized and elevated, in sharp contrast to the Elders\u2019 Stalinistic attempts at social control. As a Receiver of Memory, and in one of the film\u2019s most obvious nods to teenaged wish fulfillment, Jonas is given permission to ask questions, no matter how rude, and to lie \u2014 and he never has to apologize. \n \n Meanwhile, what he hears from parents and other authority figures is portrayed as the stuff of dehumanizing soul-murder. \u201cPrecision of language!\u201d Jonas\u2019s mother scolds him when he shares his feelings one night over dinner. Mom, by the way, is played by Katie Holmes in a suitably chilly performance as a rule-obsessed judge, intimations of the actress\u2019s own recent brush with Scientology hovering over her scenes like a teasing, troubling mist. \n \n Jonas\u2019s father, equally skillfully portrayed by Alexander Skarsgard, features prominently in \u201cThe Giver\u2019s\u201d most disturbing sequence, in which Jonas witnesses one of the grisly realities beneath the anodyne double-speak that he\u2019s now beginning to question. \n \n That double-speak, of course, recalls George Orwell at his most anti-totalitarian, as well as Ray Bradbury\u2019s \u201cFahrenheit 451,\u201d which may be \u201cThe Giver\u2019s\u201d most direct ancestor. Like \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars\u201d earlier this summer, young people have once again been given their generation\u2019s version of a message that, although not necessarily new, nevertheless may feel urgent and uniquely timely to its core audience. \u201cThe Giver\u201d has been made with deep respect for that experience, and for the book that so powerfully predicted the grim universe movie teenagers now inhabit \u2014 for worse and, in this case, for better as well. \n \n \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \n \n PG-13. At area theaters. Contains a mature thematic image and some sci-fi action/violence. 94 minutes.",

Despite big names like Meryl Streep and Jeff Bridges, the film adaptation of Lois Lowry's classic 1993 novel has just a 29% approval rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes. Here's why: \"Another week, another movie about a special adolescent who saves society from the forces of darkness,\" writes Liam Lacey at the Globe and Mail. The Giver is too much of \"the same old, same old\" in which \"Lowry\u2019s serious but simplified ideas get reduced to a barrage of visual kitsch.\" \"The Giver was ahead of its time as a book. But as a movie, it\u2019s too late,\" writes Joe Neumaier at the New York Daily News. He's one of several critics to note the similarity to recent flicks like The Hunger Games and Divergent. He acknowledges, however, \"young audiences may become aware of touchstones\" like Nelson Mandela or Tiananmen Square \"that they might normally have tuned out.\" Oh, and Taylor Swift appears in \"an unnecessary cameo.\" \"The cast is good\" and there are strong scenes when the Giver, played by Bridges, passes his knowledge on to Receiver Jonas, played by Brenton Thwaites. But the movie \"just falls flat, in almost every way. It exists and not much else,\" writes Bill Goodykoontz at the Arizona Republic. \"It's all too predictable, and way too heavy-handed.\" Ann Hornaday at the Washington Post apparently didn't get the memo. Lowry's novel \"comes to life,\" she writes. It's \"handsomely directed\" with \"an appealing, sure-footed cast,\" including strong performances from Alexander Skarsgard and Katie Holmes, who play Jonas' parents. Overall, it \"perceptively caters to its teenaged fans' own cardinal desires and anxieties,\" she writes.",

    "document": "Jintu Gogoi's neighbourhood in Sadiya, Upper Assam, is no longer friendly. Over two weeks ago, an army of eight-legged freaks invaded it. It all happened in the evening on May 8. Most of the inhabitants of Chaulkhowa Nagaon village had been to a Bihu function. When the programme drew to a close, swarms of spiders suddenly descended from nowhere and started biting the people. The festive mood soon turned into one of panic with people bumping into each other and tripping over empty benches in their frantic bid to egress. Jintu was bitten by one of these critters.It all sounded like a scene from a Hollywood horror flick, but as Jintu showed his blackened, swollen finger, to TOI, it became clear that it was not some elaborate hoax created by some mischief-monger, it was something that happened for real. But the panic it triggered could have been certainly avoided had there been enough awareness among laymen and mandarins about arachnids.Jintu spent a day at the Sadiya Civil Hospital after he complained of excruciating pain and nausea. When he returned home, he had more terrifying stories to tell. Terror was still writ large on his face even two weeks after the incident, but he thanked his stars for being alive. His neighbour,Purnakanta Buragohain, was not that lucky. He died in the hospital after a spider allegedly bit him.The events that unfolded in the next few days left everyone baffled. Scores of people arrived in the Sadiya civil hospital with spider bites, some even carrying their tormentors to the hospital. Amid all this, another person, this time a schoolboy, died of an alleged spider bite. And the district administration panicked. They sounded an alert across Tinsukia district and asked people to stay indoors at night\u2014the time the unknown critters would swarm all over the place. They talked about fogging the place with DDT to kill the arachnids but couldn't find any effective solution. What's worse: they even let the two bodies to be cremated without conducting any autopsy. Yet the spider menace continued. None had any answer as to what kind of a spider it was and how it made such a sudden appearance.Then on May 22, a team of life scientists from Dibrugarh University and Gauhati University arrived in Sadiya. Led by Dr L R Saikia, head, Department of Life Sciences, Dibrugarh University, the team camped in the trouble spot for two days and nights and collected specimens. \"As of now, we cannot give a specific name. It's similar to the tarantula, but it could be a whole new species. There aren't any arachnologists in the northeast, so it will take us a while to identify it. But whatever the species, it is a highly aggressive spider. It leaps at anything that comes close. Some of the victims claimed the spider latched onto them after biting. If that is so, it needs to be dealt with carefully. The chelicerae and fangs of this critter are quite powerful; but it's too early to declare it a killer spider. In fact, we are yet to test its venom and find out the toxicity,\" says Dr Saikia.\"We cannot say for sure that the fatalities were due to the venom; it could have been because of allergic reaction to the venom, which triggered cardiac arrest in both the victims. But all the bite patients first went to witch doctors, who cut open their wounds with razors, drained out blood and burnt it. That could have also made them sick. Also, we didn't administer any antivenin dose, as we were not sure if the spider was venomous,\" says Dr Anil Phatowali, superintendent, Sadiya Civil Hospital.He adds that the hospital is ill-equipped to handle crises due to manpower crunch, erratic power supply and equipment shortage.Dr Ratul Rajkhowa of the zoology department of Cotton College, Guwahati, has seen the spider. In fact, one of the dead creatures has been preserved in the department laboratory. He echoes Dr Saikia's views but says it's too early to call it a tarantula. \"It could be the black wishbone or a species related to it. Or may be a species related to the funnel-web spider.Whatever it is, it is definitely new to the area. Assam doesn't have venomous spiders, it never had any throughout history, or there would have been some document, text or art that depicted this spider. People wouldn't have panicked like this; they are scared because they have seen something like this for the first time and don't know how to deal with it. They are used to the common house spider, which runs away when you even snap your finger close to it. But this spider attacks if you try to scare it off. Those who were bitten have said that when they tried to shoo it off, it leapt at them and buried its fangs.\"If the spider is indeed the black wishbone, which is found in Australia, how did it come all the way to Assam? Or, if it is the funnel-web spider, how did it suddenly appear at a place that is not its usual habitat? These questions have baffled experts. \"There is a lot of insect fauna that is still to be discovered. Therefore, this could be a big find. However, what is worrying is the way these arachnids surfaced all of a sudden and started biting everyone around. Its behaviour shows that it is not used to human presence; so, there is some ground to believe that this may have been accidentally or intentionally introduced to our eco-system.Usually, animals and insects behave differently if they are introduced to a different habitat; many show an aggressive strain, especially after they have mated with local species. The hybrid ones become stronger and more aggressive. For instance, the Africanized bee or the 'killer bee', which resulted after 26 Tanzanian queen bees escaped from an apiary in Brazil and mated with local bees, was a hybrid species that also killed 1,000 people in Brazil alone. Today, it has reached up to central United States,\" says an entomologist on condition of anonymity.He adds, \"Sadiya is not alien to terror. The place was notorious for human sacrifice until the mid-19th century when the British stopped this barbaric practice. The place also suffered immensely during the 1897 and 1950 earthquakes. Then came insurgency. There were brutal gun battles in Dibru-Saikhowa National Park a few years ago between the Army and insurgents. Recently, four suspected Maoists were gunned down here. People so used to terror will not panic because of spiders unless there is something really scary about it. The government should delve into this issue and find out how these arachnids arrived here. Instead, they are doing blunder after blunder.\"On May 28, the spider allegedly appeared in Nalbari, Lower Assam\u2014a good 600 km away from Sadiya\u2014and bit a woman. The woman not only trapped the spider, she was also sane enough to come to a hospital instead of visiting a witch doctor. When TOI contacted the deputy commissioner, Lalit Gogoi, on May 31, he informed that the woman took the spider back home after treatment. It didn't occur to the babus that the specimen should have been retained and sent for lab testing.One thing that is unexplained is how the black spider appeared in swarms. \"A certain anomaly in conditions may provoke an unusual surge in breeding populations. Swarms of spiders are rare, although they have been reported, usually after flooding when the spiders search for dry and higher ground,\" says British naturalist Dr Vejay K Singh, popularly known as Dr Venom. He has heard about the spider menace and says he would like to come down and check the spider himself.TOI had showed him an image of the spider, to which he responded: \"This is indeed a theraphosid spider or more commonly called tarantula. Most likely from the genus selenocosmia or lyrognathus, but more probably the former. The spiders are nocturnal, which explains why the attacks took place at night. The selenocosmia are aggressive spiders and will bite readily when provoked. However, they are not a social spider like the poecilotheria (tree spiders) which occur in south India and Sri Lanka. So a suggestion of swarms is puzzling. Perhaps, it is more likely to be a freak case of a population sprawl in the area. And although aggressive by nature, these spiders are not considered dangerous with regards to toxicity, and are unlikely to cause a fatal bite in a healthy individual.\"Dibrugarh University has, meanwhile, sent spider specimens to Indian Society of Arachnology, Maharashtra, for identification. Their report pending and without any spider specialist visiting the region, the truth about the mysterious spider attacks in Assam continues to be covered by a cobweb.manimugdha.sharma@timesgroup.com ||||| The Indian town of Sadiya has been swarmed by deadly spiders that have killed two people, The Times of India reported. \n \n The spiders, species unknown, showed up May 8, interrupting residents as they took part in a Hindu festival, said The Times. \n \n More from GlobalPost: India's missing girls (VIDEO) \n \n Residents there fear a fresh onslaught of the \"alien\" spiders, reported The Hindustan Times. \n \n Sadiya resident Purnakanta Buragohain and an unidentified school boy both died after being bitten, reported NewsCore. \n \n Local hospitals were overwhelmed by people wounded by spider bites.

The species\u2019 gelatinous body measures about seven inches in diameter and its tentacles are webbed, giving it the appearance of an umbrella when it spreads them. \n \n These octopus swim by moving their fins, pulsing their webbed arms, pushing water through their funnel for jet propulsion, or all three at once. \n \n \u201cThey\u2019ll spread that web and parachute along and steer themselves with the fins on their mantle,\u201d says Bush, describing their movement. \n \n The octopus often swim up off the bottom and hover a bit just above the seafloor, looking for small crustaceans, worms, and other food. \n \n The thing that makes this octopus especially unique\u2014and cute\u2014is its puppy dog eyes, which Bush says, are unusually large for the size of its small body. \n \n Here\u2019s a look at seven more species discovered in the past 10 years by MBARI researchers in Monterey Bay. ||||| What do you call a tiny octopus with big eyes and gelatinous skin, and that's cute as a button?

    "document": "\u201cAmerica's strength doesn't come from lashing out,\u201d Hillary Clinton said Thursday, delivering a harsh rebuke to Donald Trump as she accepted the Democratic nomination for U.S. president. \n \n Clinton\u2019s speech capped the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, where she made history as the first female presidential nominee of a major party. While Clinton did not skip over the historic aspect of her nomination, she spent most of her hour-long speech emphasizing two, interlocking themes: the importance of community and togetherness, and the fundamental unfitness of the Republican nominee for office. It was not so dark and ominous a speech as Trump\u2019s own acceptance speech a week ago in Cleveland, but it was a negative speech: a warning against the danger posed to America by a Trump presidency. \n \n The Atlantic's coverage of the Republican and Democratic nominations for the U.S. presidential election \n \n Read more \n \n \u201cNone of us can raise a family, build a business, heal a community, or lift a country totally alone,\u201d she said, reprising a theme she introduced in It Takes a Village 20 years ago and echoing her campaign slogan, \u201cStronger Together.\u201d She added later: \u201cEvery generation of Americans has come together to make our country freer, fairer, and stronger. None of us can do it alone.\u201d \n \n The slogan, the latest of many, has never really seemed to take, but here, contrasted with Trump\u2019s charismatic, semi-authoritarian approach, it began to come into its own. What Clinton was offering is, after a fashion, a small-c conservative viewpoint, emphasizing community, family, and cooperation. Clinton contrasted that vision with Trump\u2019s, scorning a climactic phrase from his own acceptance speech: \u201cI alone can fix it.\u201d \n \n \u201cIsn't he forgetting troops on the front lines?\u201d she asked. \u201cPolice officers and fire fighters who run toward danger? Doctors and nurses who care for us? Teachers who change lives? Entrepreneurs who see possibilities in every problem? Mothers who lost children to violence and are building a movement to keep other kids safe? He's forgetting every last one of us. Americans don't say. \u2018I alone can fix it.\u2019 We say, \u2018We'll fix it together.\u2019\u201d \n \n She assailed Trump for his business career, citing his corporate bankruptcies and the stories of contractors and subcontractors who weren\u2019t paid for work they did at his resorts and casinos. She criticized him for manufacturing some of his many branded products in overseas factories, with a slightly stilted punch line: \u201cDonald Trump says he wants to make America great again. Well, he could start by actually making things in America again.\u201d She portrayed him as incapable of handling the slightest provocation, much less the pressures of the Oval Office. \n \n \u201cIn the end, it comes down to what Donald Trump doesn't get: that America is great because America is good,\u201d she said. \u201cSo enough with the bigotry and bombast. Donald Trump's not offering real change. He's offering empty promises. What are we offering? A bold agenda to improve the lives of people across our country\u2014to keep you safe, to get you good jobs, and to give your kids the opportunities they deserve.\u201d \n \n Trump, as she archly pointed out, offered little in the way of specific policy suggestions during his speech. She, in turn, often seems to enjoy the policy section of her speeches the most, and on Thursday she went through a litany of her proposals, including debt-free college education, immigration reform, campaign-finance reform, and a more robust social-safety net. As Clinton acknowledged early on, her platform has been heavily shaped by the campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont progressive who gave her a tougher run than expected during the Democratic primary. \n \n \u201cBernie, your campaign inspired millions of Americans.\u201d \n \n \u201cBernie, your campaign inspired millions of Americans, particularly the young people who threw their hearts and souls into our primary,\u201d she said. \u201cYou've put economic and social justice issues front and center, where they belong.\u201d She also reached out to Sanders\u2019s supporters, a small but extremely vocal group of whom remain opposed to her. \u201cYour cause is our cause,\u201d she said. (Not all of them bought it: On occasion, her speech was interrupted by chants of \u201cHillary,\u201d as her supporters tried to drown out hecklers.) \n \n Clinton has never been a great speaker. Despite her long record in the public eye, only a couple of memorable speeches come to mind: Her famous \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are human rights\u201d speech, and her \u201c18 million cracks\u201d speech when she conceded the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama in 2008. \u201cThe truth is, through all these years of public service, the \u2018service\u2019 part has always come easier to me than the \u2018public\u2019 part,\u201d she acknowledged Thursday. \u201cI get it that some people just don't know what to make of me.\u201d Clinton\u2019s Thursday address doesn\u2019t seem likely to join the list of noteworthy blockbusters. It was a serviceable, workmanlike speech, short on soaring rhetoric. \n \n She didn\u2019t really need to deliver such a moment. The obvious emotional peak of the night came some time earlier, as Khizr and Ghazala Khan stood on the rostrum. The Pakistani immigrants were the parents of Humayun Khan, a young Muslim American soldier killed while serving in Iraq in 2004. Speaking calmly and steadily but with great emotion, Khizr Khan addressed Trump, who has called for a moratorium on Muslims entering the United States, and more recently on immigration from areas with terrorism. \n \n \u201cLet me ask you: Have you even read the U.S. Constitution? I will gladly lend you my copy. In this document, look for the words \u2018liberty\u2019 and \u2018equal protection of law,\u2019\u201d he said, brandishing a pocket edition. \u201cHave you ever been to Arlington Cemetery? Go look at the graves of the brave patriots who died defending America\u2014you will see all faiths, genders, and ethnicities.\u201d \n \n \u201cYou have sacrificed nothing and no one,\u201d Khan said. \n \n Khan\u2019s pained, passionate words won praise from across the political world, especially among conservatives who reject Trump. The speech was part of an evening of intense patriotism, even nationalism. A few wags suggested that the Democratic National Convention\u2019s fourth night more closely resembled a Republican confab. Doug Elmets, a former aide in Ronald Reagan\u2019s White House, delivered his own endorsement of Clinton. So did Jennifer Pierotti Lim, the founder of Republican Woman for Hillary. \n \n Captain Florent Groberg, a Medal of Honor winner who was badly injured in Afghanistan, told the hall, \u201cI'm here tonight not as a Democrat or a Republican. I'm here as a proud immigrant to this country, a proud veteran of the United States Army, and the proud recipient of our country's highest military honor.\u201d \n \n The Clinton campaign is ready to build a big, broad coalition. \n \n Retired General John Allen, flanked by a rainbow platoon of veterans, delivered a fiery, martial speech. \u201cFrom the battlefield to the capitals of our allies, friends, and partners, the free peoples of the world look to America as the last best hope for peace and for liberty for all humanity, for we are the greatest country on this planet,\u201d Allen said. He added, in rebuke of Trump, \u201cWith her as our commander-in-chief, our international relations will not be reduced to a business transaction. Our armed forces will not become an instrument of torture, and they will not be ordered to engage in murder or carry out other illegal activities.\u201d \n \n The night wasn\u2019t purely nationalistic and center-right. Clinton was introduced with an underwhelming speech by her daughter, Chelsea, as her husband, former President Bill Clinton, beamed from the audience. Spotlighting the diversity of views in the party, another speaker was Sherrod Brown, the Ohio senator and progressive darling who was considered as a potential vice-presidential candidate. The Reverend William Barber II, who as president of the North Carolina NAACP spearheaded the Moral Mondays movement, delivered a thunderous, revival-style address. \n \n \u201cI say to you tonight, that some issues are not left versus right or liberal versus conservative, they are right versus wrong,\u201d Barber said. \u201cIs there a heart in this house? Is there a heart in America? Is there somebody that has a heart for the poor? A heart for the vulnerable? Then stand up. Organize together. Fight for the heart of this nation. \n \n But the evening\u2019s program was unmistakably designed to help Clinton expand her support past the Democratic Party, reaching out to moderates, Independents, and Republicans who reject Trump. The theme built on a foundation laid by President Obama in his speech Wednesday, which won somewhat grudging applause from conservatives. That strategy is not without risks. Some liberals were troubled by the tributes to police during the program, and both Allen and Groberg were interrupted by hecklers chanting, \u201cNo more war!\u201d (These, too, were drowned out with \u201cUSA\u201d chants, a feature more common at Republican rallies.) But the Clinton campaign, having weathered a stormy start to the convention, has seemingly decided it can count on a unified Democratic Party and is ready to build a big, broad coalition. Both parties entered their conventions seeking to unify their bases and turn to the general election. Only the Democrats look to have succeeded. \u2014David Graham \n \n Sacha Zimmerman Link 11:57 PM Charles Mostoller / Reuters ||||| Dan Quayle debating Lloyd Bentsen in 1988. (Darryl Heikes for USN&WR) \n \n Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen was never one given to the clever quip or colorful anecdote. Buttoned-up and taciturn, he made a disastrous stab at a presidential run in 1976. Newspaper scribe Jack Germond once compared the Democrat to plate glass\u2014substantial, but people just couldn't see it. \n \n But during a 1988 vice presidential debate in Omaha, Bentsen delivered one of the most devastating slights ever. Turning to his GOP opponent, Sen. Dan Quayle, who had defended his inexperience as similar to that of John F. Kennedy, Bentsen responded with scathing disdain: \"Senator,\" he said, \"I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you are no Jack Kennedy.\" \n \n The audience erupted. In that moment, Bentsen, on the ticket with presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, managed to remake his dry persona and earn himself a footnote in political history. \"It's the best put-down I've ever seen,\" says Germond. But was Bentsen's flawless response to Quayle, then 41 and running with George H. W. Bush, rehearsed? \n \n Yes and no, says Dennis Eckart, who helped Bentsen, then 67, prepare for the debate. An Ohio congressman at the time, Eckart ordered video of Quayle on the campaign trail. There was Quayle raking his fingers through his hair and posing witha h and thrust in his pocket\u2014all, Eckart believed, conscious imitations of Kennedy. And the Indiana senator was comparing his years in Congress to those of Kennedy. On a legal pad, Eckart jotted: \"The sob thinks he's JFK.\" \n \n The answer. Eckart had to persuade Bentsen that Quayle could make the comparison during the debate. (Germond says that Quayle's advisers had told him not to use the Kennedy reference.) Once convinced, Bentsen \"turned his whole body to me and said, 'I know John F. Kennedy. I waited for John F. Kennedy that fateful day. He's a friend of mine.'\" Eckart said, \"That's the answer.\" \n \n Bentsen, who died in 2006, basked in the post-debate attention. A union in Philadelphia played the theme from Rocky when he arrived. He felt the moment redeemed his poor performance in 1976. But great lines don't win elections. Dukakis-Bentsen got creamed. Quayle was gracious: When he saw Eckart a few months later, he touched his former colleague's new beard and said, \"I know Dennis Eckart...\" You know the rest.",

    "document": "Thousands of years ago, hobbits roamed a lush, green land. They gathered food, took shelter in cozy holes in the earth, and even battled dragons. This is no fantasy epic\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the likely lifestyle of an ancient human relative that thrived on the island of Flores in Indonesia. \n \n Discovered in 2003 in Liang Bua cave, Homo floresiensis stood about three and a half feet (1.1 meters) tall and weighed around 75 pounds (35 kilograms). Nicknamed for the diminutive heroes in J.R.R. Tolkien's famous novels, the real-life hobbits made stone tools and might have survived predatory attacks from komodo dragons. Even more exciting to anthropologists, the discovery team originally estimated that these \u00e2\u20ac\u015bhalflings\u00e2\u20ac\u0165 lived as recently as 12,000 years ago, which would mean that they outlived Neanderthals and might well have crossed paths with modern humans. \n \n However, a fresh look at the site where the fossils were found puts a twist on the tale: The latest evidence suggests that hobbits vanished from the island far earlier than thought, casting the chances of a cross-species encounter in a new light. \n \n \u00e2\u20ac\u015bSince 2007, a lot more of the cave has been excavated,\u00e2\u20ac\u0165 says study co-author Matthew Tocheri of Lakehead University in Thunder Bay, Ontario. Researchers initially used chemical clues in the soil around the fossils to figure out when layers of sediment were laid down and thus how old the bones and tools found inside them must be. In the latest work, the team found that the layers of sediment in the cave were not all evenly deposited and so varied widely in age even at similar depths. \n \n The new analysis, published today in Nature, asserts that the skeletal remains of H. floresiensis are more likely between 100,000 and 60,000 years old, and their stone tools date from as far back as 190,000 years to around 50,000 years ago. That suggests these evolutionary cousins did not exist for long after modern humans arrived in the region some 50,000 years ago. \n \n \u00e2\u20ac\u015bAt the time of the initial discovery, not enough of the older deposits had been exposed, and this led to an error in the interpretation of how the dates obtained at that time applied to the sediments that contained the hobbit remains,\u00e2\u20ac\u0165 says Tocheri, who received funding from the National Geographic Society's Waitt Grants Program for this work. \n \n Layered Story \n \n While earlier investigations focused on the cave\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s center and eastern wall, the current study, conducted by many of the same researchers, expanded excavations between these areas and toward the rear of the cave. Older deposits in certain sections of the cave had eroded away, creating a steep slope near the entrance that became filled in with younger sediments, which caused the original misinterpretation. \n \n To ensure that the new age estimates are accurate, the team used five independent dating methods, ranging from the uranium decay rate in bone to luminescence in soil, which measures the amount of time since sand was last exposed to sunlight. \n \n The erosion may also explain why excavators were unable to find all the bones from the upper body of the first known hobbit specimen. According to Tocheri, \u00e2\u20ac\u015bif the erosion had continued for just a little longer, then the entire skeleton would more than likely have been lost forever.\u00e2\u20ac\u0165 \n \n View Images Archaeologists excavate in Liang Bua cave, the site where the \"hobbit\" humans were discovered in 2003. Photograph by\u00c2 Liang Bua Team \n \n But age is just one of many bones of contention regarding H. floresiensis. Since the initial discovery, at least six additional hobbits have been exhumed in the cave, and biological anthropologists have been wrestling with issues ranging from how they first migrated to Indonesia, to the reasons for their diminutive size, to whether they even qualify as a unique human species. \n \n \u00e2\u20ac\u015bEvery finding just makes it more mysterious,\u00e2\u20ac\u0165 says Ian Tattersall, a paleoanthropologist and emeritus curator at the American Museum of Natural History who was not involved in the study. \u00e2\u20ac\u015bNobody could ever have imagined a hominid that looked like the one from Flores. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the kind of thing only nature could come up with.\u00e2\u20ac\u0165 \n \n Some experts contended that the hobbit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stature and small brain\u00e2\u20ac\u201dabout one-third the size of an adult human\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmean that the fossils belong to diseased modern humans with dwarfism, Down syndrome, or microcephaly, a developmental condition that produces a small head. Though many of these theories still circulate, a 2007 analysis conducted by Tocheri revealed that the wrist bones of H. floresiensis had very little structural similarity to modern humans and were more comparable to early hominins and chimpanzees, providing strong evidence for a separate species. \n \n RELATED: Ancient Little People Found? Watch as a scientist uncovers tiny human bones in a tropical island cave, in what could be a major discovery. \n \n The prevailing theory is that H. floresiensis is either a descendent of a hominin that arrived on Indonesia in hobbit form, or a descendent of Homo erectus that evolved into its smaller stature once on the island. This evolutionary process, called island dwarfism, occurs when a species becomes progressively smaller to reduce its food requirements on a resource-deficient island. The excavation site at Liang Bua was littered with remnants of pygmy elephants, which adds credence to this theory. \n \n Not a Fellowship? \n \n Though no direct evidence from Liang Bua shows any interaction with modern humans, Tattersall still believes it is possible that these ancestral cousins could have crossed paths, perhaps with disastrous consequences. \n \n \u00e2\u20ac\u015bThere is this pattern where ancient kinds of Homo that have been doing perfectly well for a very long time disappear as soon as Homo sapiens shows up. For one reason or another, Homo sapiens is an insuperable competitor,\u00e2\u20ac\u0165 says Tattersall. \n \n And the new estimates for hobbit extinction coincide suspiciously with the arrival of modern humans in that area. \n \n View Images The \"hobbit\" (left) had a much smaller head than modern humans, as seen in this comparison image. Photograph by Ira Block, Nat Geo Image Collection \n \n \u00e2\u20ac\u015bThe thing that I find most intriguing about the new work is its implications on how H. floresiensis went extinct,\u00e2\u20ac\u0165 says Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Human Origins Program and curator of anthropology at the National Museum of Natural History. \u00e2\u20ac\u015bIsland populations are always under threat due to fluctuations in food supply, and it could be that H. floresiensis went extinct on its own. But it also happens to coincide with the moment in time when Homo sapiens was in the neighborhood.\u00e2\u20ac\u0165 \n \n Further excavations of Liang Bua and other sites on Flores could offer more clues and answer essential questions about the development, lifestyle, and extinction of this mysterious species. ||||| Homo sapiens skull (left) next to Homo floresiensis skull (right). Did our species kill off the Hobbits? Or did we interbreed and incorporate Hobbit human DNA in their genes? Scientists are still looking for the answers. \n \n Earlier confusion about when the Hobbits and associated animals died out at Flores had to do with the depth and complexity of the cave site's geological layers. Archaeological excavations at Liang Bua can reach depths of more than 8 meters (26 feet), as shown in this photo. \n \n Big climate shifts and volcano eruptions could have also doomed the hobbits. Here is a view of Liang Bua cave, as seen from the road out front. 'Hobbit Humans' Actually Might Not Have Been Human \n \n While our species is suspect, there are other possible explanations for the demise of Hobbit humans. One is the tiny elephant relative, pygmy Stegodon , might have been hunted to death, leading to a devastating chain reaction. Hobbit Human Teeth Reveal Surprising History \n \n The latest excavations at Liang Bua limestone cave on the Indonesian island of Flores show that the Hobbits, as well as many other animals, disappeared 38,000 years earlier than thought. Their disappearance coincides with the time that our species first arrived in the region. Photos: Faces of Our Ancestors \n \n Adult so-called Hobbits (Homo floresiensis) only stood about 3.5 feet tall. New research determined that these diminutive humans vanished from a cave on the island of Flores, Indonesia, around 50,000 years ago. What (or who) killed them off? Suspicious: Hobbits Vanish When Modern Humans Appear \n \n In this depiction, so-called hobbit humans inhabit the lush world of the Indonesian island of Flores. \n \n Hobbit humans, giant storks, pygmy elephants and Komodo dragons all suddenly disappeared from a cave on the island of Flores, Indonesia, around 50,000 years ago, new research finds. \n \n Did our species do them in? \n \n The new analysis dramatically pushes back the time of disappearance of the Hobbits and associated unique animals from the site. \n \n Photos: Excavation of a Hobbit Cave \n \n Play Video What Did Ancient Humans Really Eat? Recent dietary fads, such as going paleo, suggest we should get back to eating the way we did before agriculture came along. But, as in much else in life, there are no easy or perfect answers when it comes to the foods we choose. \n \n Before now, it was thought that these little archaic humans (Homo floresiensis) died out around 12,000 years ago, but new excavations at Liang Bua cave show that the Hobbits, as well as many other animals, disappeared 38,000 years earlier -- at about the exact same time our species first arrived in the wider region. \n \n The timing, say scientists, is suspicious. \n \n Bert Roberts of the University of Wollongong and co-author of the study, which appeared in Nature, told Discovery News: \"The earliest known evidence of modern humans on Flores is from about 11,000 years ago and after, but we do know that modern humans were on other islands in the region around this time and had reached Australia by 50,000 years ago. So it is certainly a possibility to be considered, but solid evidence is needed in order to demonstrate it.\" \n \n Climate shifts and volcanoes might have also led to the sudden demise of species in and around Liang Bua, co-lead author Matt Tocheri of Lakehead University and the Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Program added. \n \n Photos: Faces of Our Ancestors \n \n Another possibility is that the tiny elephant relative, pygmy Stegodon, might have been hunted to death, leading to a devastating chain reaction. \n \n \"Pygmy Stegodon is the only large-bodied herbivore known on Flores during the Late Pleistocene, and it was clearly a primary food source for these other species,\" Tocheri explained. \"If something happened to cause the pygmy Stegodon to crash, then it more than likely would have had an adverse effect on these other species.\" \n \n The confusion about when the Hobbits and associated animals died out at Flores had to do with the depth and complexity of the cave site's geological layers. \n \n The scientists discovered that an eroded surface sloped steeply toward the cave entrance. Much younger sediments covered it during the past 20,000 years. These newer sediments were at first attributed to the Hobbit remains, but the recent and more extensive analysis disproved that idea. \n \n Hobbit Human Teeth Reveal Surprising History \n \n The latest excavation, instead, found that the Hobbits' skeletal remains date from 100,000 to 60,000 years ago, but stone tools consisting of hammered flakes and cores that were made by the Hobbits continue until about 50,000 years ago. \n \n The earliest evidence of humans on Flores comes from an area called the Soa Basin, lead author Thomas Sutikna of the University of Wollongong and the National Research Center for Archaeology said. One million-year-old stone tools were found at Soa Basin and could have been made by the Hobbits or their ancestors. \n \n The Hobbit's origins are murky, but it is suspected that they either evolved from Homo erectus, or descended from another, unknown, species of human that might have left Africa 1 to 2 million years ago. \n \n Their skeletons, first reported in 2004, reveal that they had extremely small, chimpanzee-sized brains and that adults only stood about 3.5 feet tall. They resembled fossil human species that lived in Africa and Asia 1 to 3 million years ago.",

Discovery calls the timing of the hobbits' disappearance \"suspicious,\" but the study found no proof they were wiped out by humans, and further excavations on Flores are needed. Other possible causes for the extinction of Homo floresiensis include volcanoes, overhunting of pygmy elephants, and climate change. But it's not just their death that is mysterious. Scientists still don't know why these real-life hobbits were so small, how they got to Flores, or if they're even a different species. Some experts have posited they are actually humans suffering from dwarfism or Down syndrome. (Meanwhile, ancient humans having sex with Neanderthals may be why we have allergies.)",

Brian Joyce \u201cviolated the public\u2019s trust\u201d and \u201cdecided to take the path of greed\u201d by using his office for personal profit to accept up to $1 million in bribes and kickbacks in exchange for official actions, federal investigators said Friday. \n \n Joyce, a longtime attorney and Milton Democrat who was arrested Friday, is accused of then hiding that money by creating a shell company and disguising it as \u201clegal fees.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe believe Mr. Joyce was greedy, plain and simple,\u201d FBI Special Agent in Charge Hank Shaw said. \n \n Federal authorities arrested Joyce, 55, at his Westport home on Friday. Joyce pleaded not guilty to the charges before a federal magistrate in Worcester Friday afternoon. \n \n The 113-count indictment against Joyce, stemming from a two-year investigation, includes charges of racketeering, extortion, wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the IRS and money laundering. His lawyer, Howard Cooper, said in an email to The Associated Press that he is still reviewing the charges. \n \n READ: THE FULL INDICTMENT AGAINST BRIAN JOYCE \n \n The indictment alleges that Joyce secretly profited from his position as state senator by accepting \u201ca stream of concealed bribes and kickbacks\u201d that included a free Jeep and hundreds of pounds of Dunkin Donuts coffee, in exchange for official actions before the state Legislature. He is accused of pressuring state and municipal officials to take official action on government matters. \n \n Acting U.S. Attorney William Weinreb said Joyce, who as a state senator represented more than 100,000 constituents across Milton, Randolph, Avon, Canton, Stoughton, West Bridgewater and parts of Braintree, East Bridgewater and Sharon, ran his public office as a \u201ccriminal enterprise.\u201d \n \n \u201cHe had a duty to serve (his constituents) honestly, and he violated that duty by accepting bribes and kickbacks in exchange for his official action,\u201d Weinreb said. \n \n In February 2016, the FBI and IRS raided Joyce\u2019s Canton law office. Months later, Joyce reportedly sold his Milton home and also sold his family burial plot in Milton, where he grew up. \n \n Joyce is accused of participating in a number of complex schemes dating back to 2010 that netted him hundreds of thousands of dollars and concealing the payments by using his law office as a \u201cmoney laundering conduit.\u201d Prosecutors say he also lied to the state\u2019s ethics commission and used the panel as a \u201ccloak of legitimacy for his corrupt schemes.\u201d \n \n In one case, prosecutors alleged Joyce used his position to exert influence on behalf of a New York-based energy brokerage business and formed a shell company to collect secret kickbacks from the firm. In another scheme, prosecutors say Joyce pressured the Milton Planning Board to approve a waiver sought by a developer, who gave Joyce a Jeep from one of the developer\u2019s car dealerships. \n \n The indictment also accuses Joyce of taking legislative action to aid a Dunkin Donuts franchise whose owner was paying him tens of thousands of dollars for \u201cpurported legal fees\u201d and providing him with hundreds of pounds of free coffee. Investigators allege Joyce took steps to conceal this by submitting backdated checks to the State Ethics Commission and instructed the franchise owner and his relative to falsely represent to the Ethics Commission that they had agreed to provide Joyce coffee in exchange for legal services. \n \n The indictment also alleges that Joyce attempted to use his Senate position to collect money for \u201clegal work\u201d from representatives of a Philadelphia solar company who sought Joyce\u2019s assistance with local permitting and pending legislation. \n \n Joyce is also charged with conspiring to defraud the IRS in connection with his purchase of more than $470,000 in common stock from the energy brokerage firm and falsely reporting the stock purchase as a tax-exempt retirement account rollover in his personal tax return. \n \n Weinreb would not say whether charges would be brought against any of the companies accused to be involved in the schemes but said the investigation remains ongoing. \n \n Joyce, who had served as assistant majority leader, announced last year that he would not seek re-election in 2017. He had represented his district since 1998. \n \n A 1980 graduate of Milton High School, Joyce received a bachelor\u2019s degree from Boston College School of Management and a law degree from Suffolk University Law School. \n \n As a state legislator, Joyce served as chairman of the Special Senate Committee on Government Expenditures and the Vice Chair of the Senate Committee on Redistricting. He was also a member of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy as well as the Joint Committee on Health Care Financing. \n \n In 2015, then-Senate President Stan Rosenberg asked the ethics commission to review Joyce\u2019s conduct after The Boston Globe reported on potential conflicts of interest focusing on whether he used his position to boost his law practice. \n \n In an unrelated case last year, Joyce agreed to pay nearly $5,000 to resolve issues raised by state campaign finance regulators, including using campaign funds for his son\u2019s 2014 high school graduation party. Joyce said there had been no finding of wrongdoing on his part in that case. \n \n The arrest is the second blow to the state Senate in the past week. \n \n Rosenberg announced Monday he was stepping aside as president of the chamber during a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into the circumstances surrounding reported sexual misconduct allegations by several men against his husband, Bryon Hefner. \n \n Harriette Chandler, a Worcester Democrat who is serving as acting Senate president, said in a statement about Joyce that she\u2019s confident the \u201cjustice system will come to a fair and just conclusion in the days to come.\u201d \n \n Republican Gov. Charlie Baker called the allegations against Joyce disturbing. \n \n \u201cPeople in public life need to respect the offices they hold and that means not using them for personal gain, and if the feds believe there\u2019s enough there to justify an indictment then the investigation needs to be thorough and move forward accordingly,\u201d Baker said. \n \n Last year, after federal authorities raided Joyce\u2019s law office in Canton, Baker poked fun at then-Sen. Joyce at the annual St. Patrick\u2019s Day Breakfast in Boston. \n \n (\u00a9 Copyright 2017 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved. The Associated Press contributed to this report.) ||||| Former state senator Brian A. Joyce collected about $1 million in bribes and kickbacks that he laundered through his law firm, according to a sweeping 102-page indictment that accuses the Milton Democrat of turning his public office into a criminal enterprise \u2014 even accepting hundreds of pounds of free coffee from a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts owner. \n \n Joyce, once the Senate\u2019s assistant majority leader, was taken from his Westport home in handcuffs early on Friday morning and escorted by federal agents to be booked and fingerprinted, and face federal charges of mail fraud, corruption, money laundering, and embezzlement, among many others. \n \n Acting US Attorney William Weinreb said prosecutors launched the investigation of Joyce after a series of stories by The Boston Globe that began in January 2015 looking at Joyce\u2019s mingling of public and personal business. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Weinreb said investigators estimated that Joyce\u2019s many illegal schemes have netted him about $1 million since 2010. Prosecutors say, among other things, Joyce extorted a Jeep from a Milton developer and collected more than $100,000 in phony legal fees from a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts store owner in exchange for using his influence to help them. \n \n Get Metro Headlines in your inbox: The 10 top local news stories from metro Boston and around New England delivered daily.

And he violated that duty by accepting bribes and kickbacks in exchange for his official action.\u201d \n \n Harold Shaw, special agent in charge of the Boston FBI office, was more blunt: \u201cWe believe Mr. Joyce was greedy, plain and simple.\u2019\u2019 \n \n Late on Friday afternoon, Joyce appeared in a federal courtroom in Worcester, roughly 10 hours after his arrest, in a dark blue suit and a tie. He nodded to his wife and other family members. \n \n Standing before US Magistrate Judge David Hennessy, Joyce pleaded not guilty to all the charges before he was released on $250,000 secured bond. The case was continued until a status hearing on Feb. 23. Joyce must surrender his passport, and his travel is restricted to Massachusetts and Rhode Island. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \u201cYou just heard former senator Joyce declare in a very loud and affirmative voice in federal court that he is innocent of all these charges and he expects that\u2019s what will happen in court,\u201d said Joyce\u2019s attorney, Howard Cooper, outside the courtroom as Joyce stood by his side. \n \n The 113-count indictment describes Joyce as someone who considered his duties as an elected public official secondary to his goal of secretly amassing wealth, a goal he would achieve by using the power of his Senate office to help those who allegedly provided bribes and kickbacks to him. \n \n \u201cDefendant Joyce\u2019s objective in conducting and participating in the affairs of the Senate Office . . . was to secretly profit from his position as State Senator [by] . . . accepting a stream of concealed bribes and kickbacks from private individuals and entities in exchange for his official action as specific opportunities arose,\u2019\u2019 the indictment reads. \n \n Joyce is accused of using his law office, the Joyce Law Group in Canton, \u201cas a money laundering conduit for the corrupt payments\u201d by labeling the bribes and kickbacks as legal referral fees and consulting fees for working on real estate issues, and by using the \u201ccorrupt payments\u201d to buy a 2014 Jeep, according to the indictment. \n \n David L. Ryan/Globe Staff US Attorney William D. Weinreb addressed the media about the Joyce indictment. \n \n A developer seeking help with Milton town officials is accused of handing over the Jeep to Joyce without demanding he pay the $20,000 due on the purchase price, authorities allege. The developer, John Morrill, who owns two car dealerships, has been a longtime political supporter of Joyce. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Under one scheme, federal authorities allege, Joyce spent $471,250 to purchase 65,000 shares in a company, Energi, whose business activities he was actively supporting on Beacon Hill. But Joyce never disclosed his financial ties to the company and falsely claimed the money he used to buy the stock came from a tax-free rollover of an IRA account. \n \n \u201cDefendant Joyce created sham retirement accounts for himself and his spouse in order to conceal his stock ownership from the Ethics Commission and to defraud the IRS,\u2019\u2019 the indictment alleges. \n \n Joyce is also accused of collecting hundreds of pounds of coffee \u2014 along with $125,089 in \u201cpurported legal fees\u201d \u2014 from a Carlos Andrade, a major Dunkin\u2019 Donuts franchisee who sits on the Dunkin\u2019 Donuts foundation board of directors. On one occasion in 2015, he collected 504 pounds of coffee, worth an estimated $4,278, for free, authorities allege. \n \n When the Globe asked Joyce how he obtained the free coffee in 2015, he had someone else make up a fake invoice and backdate it, the indictment alleges. At the time, his lawyer insisted Joyce had paid full retail price, like anyone else. \n \n Governor Charlie Baker told the Globe that the charges against Joyce should be a warning to anyone in public office. \n \n \u201cPeople in public life need to respect the offices they hold, and that means not using them for personal gain,\u2019\u2019 he said Friday. \u201cAnd, if the feds believe there is enough there to justify an indictment, then the investigation needs to be thorough and move forward accordingly.\u201d \n \n Acting Senate President Harriette Chandler issued a brief statement: \n \n \u201cLaw enforcement has done its job today. This case now moves to the courts, and I am confident that the justice system will come to a fair and just conclusion in the days to come.\u201d \n \n Joyce had been an early supporter of then Senate President Stanley Rosenberg, who appointed him assistant majority leader in 2015 and made him chairman of the committee that decided which bills would come up for a vote. \n \n Now, Joyce is facing more than 100 criminal charges, outpacing the corruption counts leveled against other politicians in recent years, including former House speaker Sal DiMasi and former state senator Dianne Wilkerson, who was charged with one count of bribery. DiMasi was sentenced to eight years after he was convicted of helping a software company win multimillion-dollar state contracts in exchange for kickbacks. Wilkerson was sentenced to three and a half years. \n \n If convicted on all counts, Joyce could face far more jail time. Some of the counts in the indictment carry possible sentences of up to 20 years each. \n \n But Joyce\u2019s attorney Cooper suggested that the charges against his client are the work of overzealous federal prosecutors. \n \n \u201cI should add that, in the last few years, it has been very apparent across the country that the federal government has brought a number of cases against public officials, which have either gone nowhere, or have been rejected by juries, or have been highly criticized by the courts,\u201d Cooper said. \n \n The charges against Joyce represent a stunning fall from grace over the past two years. \n \n Joyce, 55, decided not to run for reelection in 2016 \u2014 and moved out of Milton, his longtime hometown \u2014 after the FBI and IRS raided his Canton law office. The raid followed a series of stories published by the Globe describing some of the ways in which he appeared to use his public position to get private benefits for himself and his family. \n \n Joyce aroused suspicions by repeatedly receiving discounted and sometimes free goods and services, often from businesses in his legislative district. For instance, when he was angling for a Senate leadership position in late 2014, he gave his Senate colleagues expensive sunglasses that he got at a significant discount from a company in his district, as well as pounds of Dunkin\u2019 Donuts coffee. Joyce also received free dry cleaning from a Randolph dry cleaner for more than a decade, services worth thousands of dollars. Neither the sunglasses nor the dry cleaning were mentioned in the indictment. \n \n Through his attorney, Joyce denied any wrongdoing. He said he bartered the dry cleaning for legal work and paid for coffee and sunglasses the same price as anyone else. \n \n The Globe also wrote extensively about Joyce\u2019s relationship with Energi, the Peabody company that is the subject of much of the indictment. The company, which sells insurance to the energy industry, hired Joyce and his law firm to do legal work and to handle regulatory matters before the state Division of Insurance. Between 2010 and 2015, the company paid the Joyce Law Group $377,169 in fees, according to the indictment. \n \n Even so, Joyce apparently wanted more legal business and fees in return for his help with a bill promoted by the company. He filed the bill and spoke at a symposium sponsored by Energi promoting the bill \u2014 never disclosing his ties to the company. Energi put him on retainer, paying him $5,000 a month for approximately five months. \n \n \u201cWe intend to cooperate fully with the government . . . and we regret that we too were victimized by Mr. Joyce,\u201d said Brian Kelly, a lawyer who represents Energi. \n \n The indictment also describes Joyce\u2019s relationship with a company that sells solar credits, Power Management, referred to in the indictment as the \u201cenergy broker.\u201d The company paid him \u201csecret kickbacks\u201d for his help in landing the company energy consulting work with the towns of Randolph, Easton, East Bridgewater, Southbridge, and Holbrook, the indictment said. \n \n He created a shell company, \u201cWindswept LLC,\u201d where he deposited the kickbacks, the indictment says. \n \n In Milton, where he lived until this year, he allegedly approached developer John Morrill about buying and redeveloping the Milton Women\u2019s Club, a historic building that had fallen into disrepair, the indictment says. \n \n Joyce pressured the planning board to allow Morrill to take actions that would allow Morrill to build four houses on the site. In return, the indictment says, Morrill agreed to pay Joyce a kickback \u2014 a 2014 Jeep from one of his dealerships. Morrill also agreed that Joyce\u2019s wife, Mary, a local realtor, would be a sales broker for the homes built on the site. \n \n Joyce was also accused of using his position to try to extract a $25,000 fee from a Philadelphia-based solar company, Tecta Solar. The company was looking for help with legislation and permitting for a project in West Bridgewater. \n \n \u201cYeah, I can get the permit for you,\u201d Joyce told Tecta officials. \u201cIt would be through my law firm, and our fee would be $25,000 . . .\u2019 according to the indictment. \n \n Company officials told the Globe in 2015 that they were stunned by his request and declined to hire him. \n \n \u201cIt was suggested we could retain him, but we never pursued it. It was certainly not our intent and it was twisted in a completely different direction,\u201d said Samir Dube, who was then the company\u2019s managing director. \n \n John Tlumacki/Globe staff Brian Joyce pleaded not guilty to all charges Friday before he was released on $250,000 secured bond. \n \n Joshua Miller of the Globe staff contributed to this report.

He was a healthy baby boy with no conditions or ailments, the report says. \n \n Three days later, Jacob was taken to a nursery so Thompson could recover and be discharged from the hospital. \n \n The suit claims the hospital gave Thompson \u201ca combination of narcotic pain killers and sleep aids\u201d at about midnight, and a nurse brought Jacob to her about 3 a.m. so she could breastfeed. \n \n \u201cAbout an hour later, still drowsy and groggy, Mrs. Thompson noticed her son was unresponsive in her arms,\u201d the lawsuit states. \n \n Staff performed emergency procedures, and the boy was placed on life support. He was pronounced deceased at ten days old. \n \n The lawsuit alleges negligence on the part of the hospital for medicating the breastfeeding mother, putting the infant in her bed without supervision, and not having clear policies or enforcement on the dangers that the combination could create. \n \n The lawsuit is also seeking relief for the emotional distress for \"unintentionally killing her firstborn child.\" \n \n In total, the lawsuit is seeking $8,600,000 in relief. The suit was filed by the Conde Law Group of Lake Oswego. ||||| A new mother who accidentally smothered her 4-day-old baby in a hospital bed has filed an $8.6 million lawsuit against Portland Adventist Medical Center. \n \n Monica Thompson faults the Southeast Portland hospital for putting her newborn, Jacob, in bed with her in middle of the night so she could breastfeed him while she was unsupervised and heavily medicated with painkillers and sleep aids. \n \n Thompson dozed off, then awoke to find that Jacob wasn't breathing on Aug. 6, 2012, according to the lawsuit filed last week in Multnomah County Circuit Court. \n \n Jacob suffered catastrophic brain damage, and his parents removed him from life support six days later after doctors told them that his comatose state was irreversible. \n \n Kristi Spurgeon Johnson, a spokeswoman for Portland Adventist Medical Center, said Wednesday she couldn't comment on the lawsuit until the hospital has had a chance to review it. She also declined comment about the hospital's policies about newborns sharing beds with mothers. \n \n The suit highlights a grave area of concern in pediatrics: parents sleeping in the same beds with their children, including mothers sharing hospital beds with their newborns. \n \n The American Academy of Pediatrics recommended in 2011 against bed-sharing. A 2014 study in the Journal of Perinatology catalogued the deaths of 15 healthy infants while sharing beds with their mothers in U.S. maternity wards. \n \n Jacob was the first child of Monica and Graham Thompson. He was born by Caesarean section on Aug. 2, 2012, according to the suit. \n \n Monica Thompson was medicated with Ambien and Vicodin a few hours before a nurse walked into Thompson\u2019s room, gave her the baby and left around 3 a.m. on Aug. 6, 2012, according to the suit. The suit states that about an hour later, Monica Thompson was \u201cstill drowsy and groggy\u201d when she realized her son wasn\u2019t moving. \n \n \u201cShe called for a nurse while she tried to get him to respond,\u201d the suit states. \u201c... She poked him and talked to him with no reaction. When no nurse came to help, Mrs. Thompson carried her son to the hallway and frantically yelled for help.\u201d \n \n The suit states that Jacob was stabilized and transferred to Randall Children\u2019s Hospital at Legacy Emanuel Medical Center, where he died when he was 10 days old on Aug. 12, 2012, after he was taken off life support. \n \n The suit seeks damages for the baby\u2019s \u201cdesperation and anxiety\u201d as he was suffocated and his mother\u2019s \u201csevere emotional distress upon unintentionally killing her firstborn child.\u201d The suit also seeks compensation for Monica Thompson\u2019s counseling expenses for depression and post traumatic stress disorder. \n \n The suit was filed by Lake Oswego attorney Diego Conde.

In January, millions of women came out in an extraordinary and unprecedented display of power and resistance,\" Sanders said in reference to the Women's March on Washington and sister protests in cities around the world on the first day of President Donald Trump's administration. \"Now more than ever, we must support the leadership of women across the country and fight together to advance our progressive agenda.\" \n \n Protesters carry signs at the Women's March on Washington on Jan. 21, 2017. (Photo: KishaBari/Women's March) \n \n Sanders' unconventional campaign for president led a mini revolt within the Democratic Party, splintering off millennials and other supporters who raged along with him about economic disparities in America, a need for campaign finance reform, ways to rein in the cost of a college education and raise the minimum wage. \n \n When Women's March Co-founder Tamika Mallory was asked: \"People are going to say, wait a minute, there\u2019s a man as the headliner at the Women\u2019s Convention, the first women\u2019s convention in 40 years?\" she replied: \n \n \"I would say that (U.S. Rep.) Maxine Waters is also coming to the conference, and we know she has been a very, very powerful voice in terms of all we\u2019ve seen happening in terms of this administration, particularly, and she\u2019ll be at the conference as well. And a lot of other people have been invited to the conference and we\u2019re hoping to hear back from these folks. Thankfully, Sen. Sanders has agreed to attend.\" \n \n Mallory also noted Sanders knows how to mobilize a new generation of activists. \n \n WASHINGTON, DC -- Sen.

Her personal account of sexual harassment in Hollywood was published in the New York Times in September. In it, she denounced the way society dismisses women's reports of their sexual abuse, assault and harassment, drawing attention to why women so often don't speak up. \n \n Less than a month after Tamblyn's story was published, the Times came out with an expos\u00e9 revealing decades of sexual harassment and assault claims against producer Harvey Weinstein. \n \n \"The overall message is that this conference is really designed as a way to empower voices in exactly the way that you see women coming forward with their stories about Harvey Weinstein,\" Mallory said, whether those stories involve sexual violence, harassment, domestic violence, police brutality or any other form of mistreatment in their lives. \n \n RELATED: \n \n Women's Convention snags Auntie Maxine's 'Reclaiming my time' theme \n \n Michiganders: You can still get a scholarship to Women's Convention \n \n Maxine Waters will attend Women's Convention \n \n \"We want to make sure that women know they have the power in unity to come forward and tell their stories, whatever their stories may be, and we have the obligation to protect their voices. We hope that at this conference more women will feel empowered to speak out, to tell,\" she said. \n \n \"Whether that means they\u2019re an undocumented person that wants to tell their story. Whether that means they've been abused by police and they want to tell their story. Whether that means they've been sexually violated and they want to tell their story.

(Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg) \n \n In two weeks, thousands of people will convene in Detroit for the Women\u2019s Convention, the first national convention led by the organizers of the Women\u2019s March. The January march drew millions of participants worldwide in protest of President Trump\u2019s inauguration. \n \n The event aims to bring together an \u201cunprecedented\u201d number of activists and leaders to share strategies, and build on the momentum from the march, according to its website. The convention theme? \u201cReclaiming our time.\u201d \n \n But organizers came under fire Thursday after announcing that a prime speaking slot will go to a man: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). The 2016 Democratic presidential candidate will address the crowd on Oct. 27, the opening day of the three-day event, convention organizers said on social media. \n \n [Women\u2019s marches: More than one million protesters vow to resist President Trump] \n \n The announcement immediately drew backlash. Among the critics was Stephanie Schriock, the president of Emily\u2019s List, one of the convention\u2019s sponsors. \n \n \u201cThis choice sends the wrong message,\u201d she tweeted, saying Emily\u2019s List has reached out to the Women\u2019s Convention organizers to \u201cshare our disappointment and offer our help.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe have more women leaders in elected office than ever before,\u201d she added. \u201cWomen ARE leading in the Senate. This is a moment to highlight them.\u201d \n \n [Women\u2019s March prepares for its first national convention next month in Detroit] \n \n Sanders is one of only two men among the more than 60 people scheduled to speak at the convention, organizers said on Twitter.

Mallory clarified on Twitter that he is not the event\u2019s headliner. That slot is going to Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.). \n \n [Maxine Waters inspires a new anthem: \u2018Reclaiming my time\u2019] \n \n Waters inspired the theme of the weekend. In July, when Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin dodged her question during a House Financial Services Committee hearing, she chided him for wasting her allotted time and repeated the phrase, \u201creclaiming my time.\u201d The exchange inspired a hashtag and scores of memes. \n \n The Women\u2019s Convention is led predominantly by women of color, Mallory said on Twitter, who defended the Sanders decision to critics: \u201cWe announce one man as a speaker among over 60, and y\u2019all start saying he\u2019s our leader?!\u201d \n \n MAXINE WATERS IS THE #WOMENSCONVENTION HEADLINER!

Mallory (@TamikaDMallory) October 12, 2017 \n \n Organizers said they invited many elected officials to attend the convention, including Hillary Clinton, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), but the event did not work with their schedules. \n \n Still, a number of women and men on social media criticized the choice to schedule Sanders on the convention\u2019s opening day. \n \n \u201cUnbelievable,\u201d tweeted Leela Daou, co-founder of political site Verrit. \u201cThere are countless women who deserve that stage time.\u201d \n \n \u201c#reclaiming our time?\u201d another woman tweeted. \u201cNot this way.\u201d \n \n Sadly not one single woman was available. https://t.co/5cKMdkxhHt \u2014 Jennifer Wright (@JenAshleyWright) October 12, 2017 \n \n A white dude is delivering the opening speech at the first women\u2019s convention in 40 years. \n \n \n \n Such progress.

The registration fee is $295 per person and $125 for those under 25. The convention is pegged to be one of the largest of its kind, and it will offer a variety of workshops and training sessions, according to its website. \n \n In contrast to the Women\u2019s March the day after President Trump\u2019s inauguration, which was an emotional protest, the October convention will focus on instruction and training on leadership and activism, organizer Linda Sarsour told The Post last month. \n \n \u201cThese are people who are still fired up,\u201d Sarsour said. \u201cWhat they are looking for is another opportunity to build and feel inspired and motivated.\u201d \n \n Morning from Morning Mix: \n \n A healthy mom gives birth at a hospital.

Women know that our time and work is often undervalued, underpaid, and unknown. Your work is not unknown. Thank you. \n \n At this moment, however, we must voice our deep disappointment with the choice to have Senator Sanders, a male, open the Women\u2019s Convention. \n \n Sign this petition to let the Women\u2019s Convention organizers know that we do not want Senator Sanders to OPEN the Women\u2019s Convention. We believe a female-identifying individual should open the Women\u2019s Convention, as optics are important, and there is no one more qualified to speak about women\u2019s issues than a woman. \n \n In an October 12th USA Today article, Women\u2019s March co-chair Tamika Mallory (whom I highly respect), states that Sanders was chosen because he \u201cknows how to mobilize a new generation of activists,\u201d and \u201cis probably one of the most powerful U.S. Senators ... on progressive issues, women\u2019s issues\u2026\u201d \n \n We believe: \n \n o Bernie does know how to mobilize a new generation of activists (for that we are grateful) but did the organizers forget that WOMEN organized the largest protest in US history? \n \n o Bernie has been a long time champion for progressive values (again, we are grateful) \n \n o Bernie\u2019s voice, and the voices of ALL men, women, non-conforming, non-binary, cis, and transgender people who share a passion for the unity principles of the Women\u2019s March are needed and necessary voices for this movement. We want them at the convention. We want them listening. We want them leading. We want to learn from them, be challenged by them, changed and ignited by them. We even want them speaking at the Convention - just not opening it. \n \n o Optics are extremely important. The Women\u2019s Convention, in her goal of empowering and putting the voices of women on the front lines, should lead by example and have a woman open the convention. The individual who kicks off an event often becomes the \u201cface\u201d of the event. It is only right to have a woman's face for the Women\u2019s Conference. Having a man\u2019s face only continues the invisible presence, work, and voices of women. \n \n o Women are best qualified to speak about women\u2019s issues. \n \n o Sanders' reference to Planned Parenthood as \u201cthe establishment\u201d makes him a divisive opener. \n \n Not choosing a woman clearly communicates that the organizers don\u2019t believe a woman is qualified, available, or equal to the task of opening the Women\u2019s Convention, and further communicates there are no strong female leaders in our nation right now. We know this is not true and strongly urge you to reconsider your decision to have Bernie Sanders open the convention. \n \n Thank you. \n \n Amanda \n \n Mother, Minister, Magic-Maker ||||| Washington (CNN) Organizers behind the Women's Convention still feel the Bern -- and for that, they are feeling the backlash. \n \n On Thursday, the Women's Convention organizers -- who also led the Women's March in January -- announced Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders will be a featured speaker at the three-day event, which will take place in Detroit later this month. \n \n The convention \"aims to have participants leave inspired and motivated, with new connections, skills and strategies for working towards collective liberation for women of all races, ethnicities, ages, abilities, sexual identities, gender expressions, immigration statuses, religious faiths, and economic statuses,\" according to its press release. \n \n The news of Sanders as one of the headliners was met by mixed reactions on Twitter. \n \n \"What ultimately disappoints me about the choice of Sanders to open the first Women's Convention in some 40 or so years is that we have some excellent leaders to choose from who are women,\" Valerie Street, who tweeted her disappointment, told CNN. \"Ones who are blazing their own trails in American politics right now.\" \n \n The 35-year-old, who is a community organizer from Austin, Texas, said she is not planning on attending the convention because of scheduling conflicts; though she did participate in the March in January. \n \n \"The Women's March nucleus has been such a woman-led movement,\" she said. But the Sanders news \"seems like an odd departure from that at a critical time.\" \n \n Others echoed this view, and questioned why a man is the opening-night speaker. The convention's official theme is \"Reclaiming Our Time,\" inspired by the viral phrase Rep. Maxine Waters' repeated to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in August. Waters will also speak at the convention. \n \n Sorry. I'm not attending a women's convention where the opening night speaker isn't a woman. Perhaps consider these choices next time. pic.twitter.com/HiVpQ3I78n \u2014 Jean Grey 2017 (@JeanGrey80) October 12, 2017 \n \n \"Sorry. I'm not attending a women's convention where the opening night speaker isn't a woman,\" one Twitter user wrote, sharing a photo collage of Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar. \"Perhaps consider these choices next time.\" \n \n The petition, created by Amanda Hambrick Ashcraft, said: \"Bernie's voice, and the voices of ALL men, women, non-conforming, non-binary, cis, and transgender people who share a passion for the unity principles of the Women's March are needed and necessary voices for this movement.

We even want them speaking at the Convention -- just not opening it. ... Having a man's face only continues the invisible presence, work and voices of women.\" \n \n Some of the backlash geared toward the Sanders pick also stems from leftover frustration from the 2016 election. Although the Women's March rallied thousands across the US, some argued the organizers were not inclusive enough of Hillary Clinton, who was the first woman to win the nomination for president of a major political party. \n \n \"I knew you weren't to be trusted when you threw HRC under the bus at the march, but this is beyond the pale,\" one user wrote on Twitter Thursday. \n \n I knew you weren't to be trusted when you threw HRC under the bus at the march, but this is beyond the pale. \u2014 RogueArtist (@TinaDuryea) October 12, 2017 \n \n Despite the uproar, Tamika Mallory, Women's March co-president, said she feels Sanders is the perfect fit for the convention, describing him in a statement as a \"fierce champion of women's rights\" and someone who has bolstered \"female voices throughout his career of public service.\" \n \n \"We invited many elected officials to our convention that align with the purpose and mission of our existence -- to harness the political power of diverse women and their communities to create transformative social change,\" she said in follow-up statement after the news was announced. \"We are thrilled that Rep. Maxine Waters and Sen. Sanders will be speaking at the Women's Convention.\" \n \n Mallory elaborated that while some female lawmakers won't be present, they still extended their support for the event. \n \n \"We all know how busy women leaders are, and we are grateful for the support of women like Secretary Clinton along with Sens. Harris, Warren and (Kirsten) Gillibrand,\" Mallory said. \"Although their schedules did not allow them to join us in Detroit the weekend of October 27, they will be fighting for our shared values, as they do every day. Our program features more than 60 women leading in activism, organizing and advocacy, as well as grassroots leaders running for and serving in office across the country. We are excited to come together, to unite across our differences and to fight for the future we all believe in.\" \n \n In a series of tweets on Thursday afternoon , Mallory addressed criticism from Women's March followers. \n \n \".@womensmarch is led by women, mainly WOC. We announce one man as a speaker among over 60, and y'all start saying he's our leader?!\" she wrote. \"When you lash out at WOC leaders, saying we have a man as our headliner/leader, you erase our work. You erase Rep Waters' work. LISTEN TO US. To the folks yelling at @womensmarch & directly at me: Why does your version of advocating for women's rights = bashing Black women leaders?\" \n \n .@womensmarch is led by women, mainly WOC.

Mallory (@TamikaDMallory) October 12, 2017 \n \n She pointed out that the convention has over \"60 speakers currently lined up. Only 2 are men.\" She emphasized that Waters, who is a black woman, was announced as a speaker in mid-September. \n \n A representative for Sanders said he had no further comment aside from his additional statement in the press release, in which he expressed his enthuasism for the event. \n \n In a statement provided in the initial press release, Sanders expressed enthusiasm about the event. \n \n \"I'm honored to join the women at the front lines of our struggle for economic, social, racial and environmental justice,\" Sanders said. \"In January, millions of women came out in an extraordinary and unprecedented display of power and resistance.

The group was called the Kit Kat club and took its name from an abbreviated version of the owner's name. ||||| SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email \n \n Photographer: Jason Adlen/Bloomberg Photographer: Jason Adlen/Bloomberg \n \n Nestle SA may find it harder to convince U.K. judges that the shape of its KitKat chocolate bar is distinct enough to trademark after the European Union\u2019s top tribunal set strict limits on what qualifies for the status. \n \n For a shape to deserve a trademark, owners must prove that consumers can recognize the product exclusively by that characteristic, and not in combination with another trademarked aspect, the EU Court of Justice said in a ruling Wednesday. The judgment gave both sides an opportunity to claim victory. \n \n The EU court decision will help guide a U.K. tribunal handling a clash between Cadbury, the U.K.\u2019s biggest chocolate maker, and Nestle over the Swiss company\u2019s 2010 application to trademark the four-fingered chocolate bar, which brought in 40 million pounds ($61.7 million) a year between 2008 and 2010 in the U.K. Cadbury separately is fighting an EU trademark Nestle got for the shape of its chocolate bar in 2006 in a case that\u2019s been pending in a lower EU court since 2013. Any decision will determine whether or not the trademark is valid. \n \n The KitKat was first sold in Britain in 1935 by Rowntree & Co., with the shape changing very little since then. Nestle, the world\u2019s biggest food company, bought Rowntree Plc in 1998. \n \n The U.K. Trade Marks Registry turned down the application to protect the shape of the chocolate bar in the U.K. in 2013 following the opposition from Cadbury. \n \n The EU court Wednesday said trademark protection can\u2019t be given if a shape \u201ccontains three essential features, one of which results from the nature of the goods themselves and two of which are necessary to obtain a technical result.\u201d \n \n Vevey, Switzerland-based Nestle said it was \u201cpleased with the decision\u201d and \u201cnow looks forward to the decision of the U.K. High Court.\u201d Mondelez International Inc., which owns Cadbury, said in an e-mailed statement that the court\u2019s ruling \u201cis in line with our contention that the shape of the KitKat bar is not distinctive enough to be protected as a trademark.\u201d \n \n Nestle won a U.K. Court of Appeal ruling in October 2013 blocking Cadbury from obtaining a trademark for the color purple it uses to package its milk chocolate. \n \n The case is: C-215/14, Societe de Produits Nestle SA v. Cadbury UK Ltd.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It started with a candy wrapper and ended (for now) in a courtroom. Nestle's attempts to trademark the shape of its \"four-fingered\" KitKat have been rejected by the European Court of Justice, which ruled that shape alone isn't enough to recognize it as a KitKat, the BBC reports. The decision was a setback for Nestle\u2014which manages the brand overseas; Hershey is licensed to sell the brand here in the US\u2014and a victory for Cadbury, which was trying to block the trademark. The ruling means that, for now, other candy companies can make similar-looking chocolate bars. Nestle, which reaped more than $60 million a year from 2008 to 2010 in the UK from KitKat, argued that the four-fingered design has become inextricably associated with the KitKat brand over the past eight decades, Bloomberg notes. But Cadbury said the shape wasn't enough to make a consumer automatically think \"KitKat,\" and the court agreed. The BBC even notes that in Norway, a lesser-known chocolate bar called Kvikk Lunsj (\"quick lunch\") has been around for nearly as long as KitKat. The fight between the two confectionary giants is the second major brouhaha they've had in recent years: In 2013, Nestle managed to block Cadbury's attempts to trademark its signature purple-colored chocolate wrappers, per Bloomberg. KitKat case now heads back to the UK High Court, which will render a final decision. (Claims of excess lead in Nestle noodles led to a major recall in India.)",

She has been studying life in rural India for some time, Singh said. \n \n A Kolkata-based tourist guide had taken the Japanese woman to Bodh Gaya to show her the Buddhist pilgrimage centre where Gautama Buddha is said to have obtained enlightenment under a tree. He was joined by four others in keeping her in captivity and raping her, police said. \n \n Two of the arrests were made in the area on Friday and one took place earlier this week in Kolkata, police added. \n \n India has a long history of tolerance of sexual violence, but a series of high-profile rape cases have triggered strong public outrage in recent years, leading to tougher anti-rape laws. \n \n India has doubled prison terms for rapists to 20 years and criminalised voyeurism, stalking and the trafficking of women. \n \n The law also makes it a crime for police officers to refuse to open cases when complaints are made. ||||| NEW DELHI \u2014 Five men have been arrested in connection with the alleged abduction and rape of a Japanese woman who said she was held captive for 12 days, the Indian police said Saturday. \n \n The young woman, who had been staying in Kolkata, said she had been lured by a man posing as a tour guide to travel to the Gaya district in the state of Bihar, the site of one of India\u2019s holiest Buddhist temples, according to the Kolkata police. When she arrived in Gaya, two other men were waiting, she told police, saying the two held her at gunpoint and raped her. \n \n The police said the episode occurred sometime after her arrival in Kolkata on Nov. 20 and that she had first been taken to Digha, a resort in West Bengal by men involved in the case. The Press Trust of India, a news service, quoted the police as saying that she had been forced to remove money from her bank account. \n \n Anxiety in India over violence against women has been very high since the December 2012 gang rape of an Indian woman on a Delhi bus, an attack so brutal that she died of her injuries. \n \n Details of the latest case, including how long the woman was reportedly held, varied widely as the police continued their investigation Saturday. It was unclear how two of the five men were involved in the case. \n \n The police said that at least one of the five men spoke Japanese and that two were brothers. \n \n A senior police official in Kolkata, Pallab Kanti Ghosh, said on Saturday that after being held, the woman went to the city of Varanasi, where she told a group of Japanese tourists what had happened. She then returned to Kolkata and the Japanese Consulate put her in touch with the police in late December, Mr. Ghosh said. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n It remained unclear if she had been released by the men or had escaped. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Yogita Limaye reports from Delhi on another sexual violence case in India \n \n Five men have been arrested in India charged with kidnapping and repeatedly raping a Japanese student. \n \n Police in the eastern city of Calcutta say the assaults took place over a period of more than a month from 23 November and in at least two locations. \n \n They say an organised gang is suspected of targeting single women tourists. \n \n Increasing numbers of rape cases are being reported and highlighted in India, prompting widespread outrage. \n \n Pallav Kanti Ghosh, a Calcutta police commissioner, told BBC Hindi that two of the men - said to be brothers - approached the 23-year-old victim as tourist guides after she arrived in the city and checked into a hotel in an area popular with foreign tourists. \n \n Trafficked at Buddhist holy site \n \n \"One of the men spoke very fluent Japanese,\" he said. \n \n \"They said: 'We are guides and want to take you sight-seeing.' \n \n \"They took her to Digha [a beach resort in West Bengal state] on 23 November.

The Hindustan Times newspaper said some were held after their mobile phone calls were intercepted. \n \n He said police were searching for other members of what he called an organised gang, several of whom are reportedly proficient in Japanese. \n \n Sexual violence in India has been in the spotlight since a student was fatally gang-raped on a bus in Delhi two years ago. \n \n That and other cases have prompted a domestic and international outcry. \n \n Other foreign women targeted by gang-rapists include a Swiss cyclist assaulted in central India in 2013 and a Danish tourist attacked in Delhi a year ago. \n \n Rape laws have been toughened in response to the crimes but correspondents say this has failed to act as a deterrent.",

    "document": "Updated and corrected. \n \n On a muggy Fourth of July night just outside Austin, Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke walked on stage wearing a light blue button-down, with a Texas-size American flag in the background. But rather than one of his campaign rallies in his Senate bid against Republican Ted Cruz, the Democrat was in front of the thousands that came out for Willie Nelson\u2019s Fourth of July Picnic, an annual celebration of country music started by the legendary singer 45 years ago. \n \n Met with a mix of wild cheers and a fair share of booing on the soggy holiday, O\u2019Rourke explained why this Independence Day mattered even more to the country, expressing hope that \u201cthe big, bold, confident, strong people of the state of Texas\u201d would help show the rest of the United States that there\u2019s no need to be afraid of immigrants, Muslims or anyone else who might be considered different. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s my honor to be here tonight, to be able to work with so many of you,\u201d he said just before the fireworks, \u201cto be with legends like Ray [Benson] and Willie, who ensure that in times of disappointment and darkness that we meet that with power and joy and rock-and-roll music.\u201d \n \n Soon after, O\u2019Rourke, whose punk-rock roots would later be rehashed by the Cruz campaign, shed his button-down for a black T-shirt and guitar and joined Nelson and the rest of his band on stage for spirited renditions of \u201cRoll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die\u201d and \u201cWill the Circle Be Unbroken\u201d to close out the show. \n \n For Nelson, the jam session with O\u2019Rourke was the latest in a career filled with activism and liberal-leaning political stances that have largely gone against the norm for country-music culture. \n \n But for some of Nelson\u2019s fans, his partnership with O\u2019Rourke was the breaking point. After Nelson announced Wednesday that he would be headlining a Sept. 29 rally for O\u2019Rourke in Austin, fans have taken to social media to boycott and publicly disown the country legend. \n \n On Nelson\u2019s Facebook page, where he posted an article from news outlet Austin360 with the announcement, some of the most striking remarks accuse the performer of aligning with what they believe to be the \u201csocialist\u201d positions of O\u2019Rourke. \n \n \u201cGoodbye Willie,\u201d David R. Williams posted on Facebook. \u201cI don\u2019t support socialist commies!

In 1980, President Jimmy Carter invited him to perform at the White House. Nelson later said that during the visit he smoked what he called a \u201cbig fat Austin torpedo\u201d on the roof of the White House. He has supported President Barack Obama, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Hillary Clinton in recent years. \n \n He even released a song last year inspired by President Trump, called \u201cDelete and Fast-Forward.\u201d \n \n \u201cDelete and fast-forward the news.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A free Willie Nelson concert in the heart of the Lone Star State seems like something that would attract fans of all political stripes, but there's a good chance the Sept. 29 event will feature a largely left-leaning crowd. That's because the country crooner is headlining a \"Turn Out for Texas\" rally in Austin for Beto O'Rourke, the Democratic challenger to GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, and many of Nelson's fans aren't happy about it, KTRK reports. Per Austin360, it's \"the first public concert Nelson has held for a political candidate,\" the singer's publicist says in a release, though Rolling Stone notes he's put on private concerts for politicians in the past. \"My wife Annie and I have met and spoken with Beto and we share his concern for the direction things are headed,\" Nelson says in the release. \"Beto embodies what is special about Texas, an energy and an integrity that is completely genuine.\" The site notes Nelson even brought O'Rourke out on stage during his Fourth of July concert. None of this pleases Nelson's more conservative fans, who see his ties to O'Rourke as a \"breaking point,\" per the Washington Post. \"I am certain you've lost your mind,\" one commenter wrote on Nelson's Facebook page, while another noted: \"Willie's position is proof positive that marijuana use over time kills brain cells.\" Still others are dumping already purchased tickets to future Nelson shows. Many, however, applauded Nelson's decision. \"So glad you are involved in this good cause. I have always been a fan, and am now a bigger fan,\" noted one well-liked post. The Post notes Nelson has long been politically active, throwing his support behind Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Bernie Sanders, and advocating for pot legalization, gay marriage, and the environment.",

Other countries could help by not allowing their own companies to partner MOGE unless it was signed up to such codes,\" she said. \n \n Responsible investment was the key to helping her resource-rich country along the path to democracy after nearly 50 years of military rule, she said. \n \n The hugely popular leader of Myanmar's opposition had been fearful until now that if she left Myanmar, the junta whose rule she fought against for two decades would block her return. \n \n But after months of cautious rapprochement with Thein Sein, a former general who convinced her to run in by-elections, she accepted an offer to go to Thailand to attend the World Economic Forum on East Asia two weeks ago in one of the clearest signs yet of her confidence in Myanmar's reforms. \n \n LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN CONTRACTS \n \n Myanmar has granted Chinese state-owned oil firm CNPC oil and gas pipeline concessions that will enable Middle East energy supplies to a take short-cut on the route to China, cutting out the extra expense and journey time of using the Malacca Strait. \n \n \"Quite frankly none of us know what's in those contracts, this is what I mean by lack of transparency in the country,\" Suu Kyi told a news conference. \"Lack of transparency leads to all kinds of suspicions that shore up trouble for the future.\" \n \n Asked about Chevron and Total, the big Western oil firms with investments in Myanmar, she said: \"I have to say that I find that Total is a responsible investor in the country, even though there was a time when we did not think they should be encouraging the military regime by investing in Burma. \n \n \"They were sensitive to human rights and environmental issues and now that we've come to a point in time when we would like investors who are sensitive to such issues, I am certainly not going to persuade Chevron or Total to pull out.\" \n \n A day after the ILO, a United Nations agency, lifted its more than decade-old restrictions on Myanmar in recognition of progress including a new law on trade unions and pledge to end forced labour, Suu Kyi said foreign direct investment that created jobs should be welcomed. \n \n As sanctions are lifted, investment should be responsible and help the process of democratisation, she said. \n \n \"Burma is a land with a lot of energy resources. We do not want to dissipate it. I would like to see a sound effective energy policy in Burma and this should be related to the kind of extractive investments that we invite in.\"",

Burma currently has contracts with several foreign firms, including Chevron, Total, and China's CNPC. \"Quite frankly, none of us know what's in those contracts,\" Suu Kyi said, according to Reuters. Suu Kyi did, however, allow that, despite having struck a deal with the junta, Total \"is a responsible investor in the country\" and was \"sensitive to human rights and environmental issues.\" She also called for a \"democracy-friendly development policy\" coupled with various business reforms. \"No country can claim genuine development until all its peoples can enjoy the basic freedoms.

    "document": "Under a new Arizona abortion law that takes effect Thursday, more babies with fatal fetal defects are expected to be carried to term, even though they will die within minutes, hours or days. But more will also be done to help their families get through the trauma of losing a child. \n \n House Bill 2036 forbids doctors from aborting most fetuses with a gestational age of 20 weeks or older, even in situations where the doctor discovers the fetus has a fatal defect. The law also defines gestational age as beginning on the first day of the woman's last period, meaning abortions are actually banned starting at 18 weeks of pregnancy -- typically about the same time a doctor would perform ultrasounds where most abnormalities are detected. \n \n Eight other states also ban abortions after 20 weeks, but Arizona is the only one with a law that actually pushes the ban back to 18 weeks into the pregnancy. \n \n According to state records, women in Arizona terminate about 100 pregnancies a year after 20 weeks, but it's unclear how many of those are because of a problem with the pregnancy. \n \n The new law requires doctors to offer information about perinatal hospice services to women considering abortion at any stage of their pregnancy because of a fatal fetal abnormality. It also requires the state to maintain a website list of organizations that provide services. \n \n The two organizations that offer such help, MISS Foundation and Embrace, provide counseling and comfort, help develop birth plans, attend births, organize meals, create mementos, make funeral arrangements and prepare families for every outcome. \n \n The Legislature provided no funding for such services, and volunteers for the two groups, while thrilled the state and doctors will spread the word about the service, worry they'll be overwhelmed when the law takes effect. \n \n In other states with similar abortion restrictions, most of the programs for families continuing with a difficult pregnancy are hospital- or hospice-based. They also often don't provide services as broad as the Arizona organizations do, such as services that extend to the entire family and continue after delivery. \n \n The Arizona organizations scrape by with private donations and volunteer help. Unlike similar pediatric programs for sick children or hospice services, before-birth programs are a relatively new idea and not billable to insurance companies. Participating families aren't asked to pay for help. \n \n \"This law may have intended to do good, but it can really adversely affect non-profit organizations that desperately want to help people but maybe can't help the number of people who now come to us,\" MISS Foundation founder and CEO Joanne Cacciatore said. \"We are already stretched very, very thin. I don't know where this money would come from.\" \n \n Cacciatore said one or two families a month facing a pregnancy with a fatal prognosis contact MISS Foundation. \n \n \"They're finding us on their own,\" she said. \"I don't know what will happen when the Legislature opens this up.\" \n \n Berdette Carrasco, Dana Southworth, Christina Portillo and Dani Baxter run Embrace while juggling full-time jobs and caring for their own families. They do what they do because they have expertise in obstetrics and therapy, and are compelled to help others. Carrasco and Southworth have gone through the loss of one of their own children because of a fetal anomaly. \n \n \"The natural order is that grandparents die,\" Southworth said. \"It's not children dying before parents. It shatters our order.\" \n \n Carrasco said she doesn't know how many new families the new law may bring to them, but they are trying to prepare for everyone who may need their help. \n \n \"There will be people now having to continue a pregnancy without an option (in Arizona),\" she said. \"We want to support these families.\" \n \n Getting help \n \n Julia Gonzales still had an option when she learned earlier this year that there was something very wrong with her baby. Her daughter Carmen is due any day now, but she likely won't live long enough to take her first breath. \n \n Eighteen weeks into the pregnancy, doctors diagnosed Carmen with anencephaly, a neural-tube defect in which babies develop without most of their brain or skull. \n \n As a devout Catholic, Gonzales, 30, refused to consider abortion. \n \n \"I didn't even have the idea in my mind to stop the pregnancy,\" she said. \"And then two weeks after they told us, we saw her. She was a girl. But we never expected it would be this bad. Sometimes I wonder why I didn't stop the pregnancy.\" \n \n Gonzales is an example of what an unknown number of Arizona women will be required to face under HB 2036. But she's also getting the kind of help that will be more accessible under the new law. \n \n Gonzales struggles to speak through her tears when she thinks about what will happen when Carmen is born. But she is determined to spend every moment she can with her daughter. She's getting through each day largely with the help of the women who run Embrace. \n \n Resource for families \n \n Embrace has about 20 clients. The Gonzales family and one other are awaiting the births of their children. Some of the other families are grieving the death of their child while others are learning how to care for and celebrate children with various health challenges. \n \n \"Bereavement is a piece of what we do, but not everything,\" Carrasco said. \"A lot of babies with congenital anomalies will survive. We are meeting needs of the family that are not just medical, but are also emotional.\" \n \n She said their goal is to give families a single resource to help coordinate every need they may have. When Embrace workers first meet with a family, they provide them with accurate medical information about their child's diagnosis and connect them with other families who faced similar diagnoses. \n \n \"Obstetricians tend to not have enough time to educate,\" Portillo said. \"Sometimes we are the first person to really explain something.\" \n \n They prepare the family physically and emotionally for what to expect when their child is born. \n \n Carrasco said she doesn't expect that to change much when more families seek help because they have no choice in continuing with the pregnancy. \n \n \"We have dealt with a couple of families that, because of late diagnosis or a lack of prenatal care, they didn't have a choice,\" she said. \"I don't feel that there was a difference between the people choosing and those who did not by the time they get to this place in their pregnancy.\" \n \n She said the fear, sadness and stress are the same. \n \n \"These families are hurting,\" Carrasco said. \"As the delivery happens, regardless of the outcome, the level of stress is significant. There is a dramatic difference in a family not having anyone to help and them having an organization that knows what they're going through.\" \n \n The Embrace workers go to doctor appointments with the families and help translate medical jargon that can become overwhelming. They meet in advance with the delivery staff to ensure everyone understands what the family wants the delivery to be like, and are there to help during labor and delivery. \n \n \"We do everything we can to give this child the best quality of life, even if it's just one second of life,\" Carrasco said. \n \n Moving away from guilt \n \n Gonzales, her husband, Joaquin, and 4-year-old twins Christian and John Carlos have met with the Embrace women half a dozen times. Gonzales' doctor told her about them when she was diagnosed, but she never called. Her doctor called Embrace and asked them to help. \n \n \"If that doctor hadn't called Berdette (Carrasco), I wouldn't have been able to make it this far,\" Gonzales said. \n \n Before they got involved, Gonzales and her husband struggled to talk to each other about the baby, and her extended family refused to acknowledge the situation. Now the adults are starting to talk to the twins about how sick their baby sister Carmen is and how she will die. \n \n \"At the beginning, I was fighting with God every day,\" Gonzales said. \"When I started talking with Berdette and Dana, they showed me God had a purpose. Thanks to them, it's been easier going through this.\" \n \n Southworth pushes them to move away from guilt, from asking why and instead focusing on their love for Carmen. \n \n \"Love her where she's at. What are places you would want to take her? Go there now before she's born and make memories,\" she tells them. \n \n Gonzales is trying, but she's not there yet. \"How do you enjoy it when you know your daughter's going to die?\" she sobbed. \"I know I have to enjoy every move she makes inside me, but I can't. I'm trying to find a reason God gave us this baby.\" \n \n Prepared no matter what \n \n Not every family Embrace works with has a sad ending. Mike and Kelly Ely learned 18 weeks into their pregnancy that their son Preston had DiGeorge syndrome. The chromosomal disorder has a wide range of outcomes, most of which aren't known until the baby is born. Preston could have been born blind and deaf, with learning disabilities, deformed features or heart defects. He also could have died at birth. \n \n \"Embrace was a huge support system,\" Kelly Ely said. \"They made us feel so much more comfortable going forward with the pregnancy.\" \n \n She said Embrace workers explained what they could expect and helped the couple cope emotionally. \n \n The Embrace workers also helped the couple communicate with each other and assured them it was OK to be excited about the pregnancy. \n \n Preston was born with heart defects and had surgery at a week old. He has club feet, which can be corrected. Now 5 months old, he's a beautiful, bright-eyed, happy baby. \"He's a little miracle,\" Kelly Ely said. \n \n Support through it all \n \n Together the Gonzales family and Embrace staff have written out a birth plan giving instructions to the hospital staff. Gonzales is terrified of what Carmen will look like, and at the same time feels guilty that fear makes her a bad mother. \n \n \"I'm so scared about seeing her,\" she said. \"When I remember her, I don't want to remember her looking like that. I'm so worried I won't be a good mom for her.\" \n \n When she's born -- no matter how long she lives -- Julia and Joaquin will bathe Carmen, dress her in a gown and have a priest baptize her. A professional photographer will capture the only family photos they'll ever take with her. They'll take as long as they need to say goodbye. \n \n \"This is their last chance to parent their child,\" Southworth said. \n \n The women of Embrace have prepared the Gonzales family as best they can. But nothing can prepare parents to watch their child die at birth. And nothing can dissuade them from holding out hope for the impossible. \n \n \"We're expecting a miracle,\" Gonzales said. \"When you hear her heart, it's hard to believe she's not strong.\" \n \n So in the end, when there is no miracle, the women of Embrace will offer the most important thing they have -- they'll be there. \n \n \"We can't fix this, but we can let them know how much we care,\" Southworth said. ||||| Arizona's ban on abortions starting at 20 weeks of pregnancy is poised to take effect this week as scheduled after a federal judge ruled Monday that the new law is constitutional. \n \n U.S. District Judge James Teilborg said the statute may prompt a few pregnant women who are considering abortion to make the decision earlier. But he said the law is constitutional because it doesn't prohibit any women from making the decision to end their pregnancies. \n \n The judge also wrote that the state provided \"substantial and well-documented\" evidence that an unborn child has the capacity to feel pain during an abortion by at least 20 weeks. \n \n Republican Gov. Jan Brewer signed the measure into law in April, making Arizona one of 10 states to enact types of 20-week bans. \n \n Arizona's ban, set to take effect Thursday, prohibits abortions starting at 20 weeks of pregnancy except in medical emergencies. That is a change from the state's current ban at viability, which is the ability to survive outside the womb and which generally is considered to be about 24 weeks. A normal pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks. \n \n The New York-based Center for Reproductive Rights and another group filed a notice that they would be appealing Teilborg's decision to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. \n \n \"Today's decision casts aside decades of legal precedent, ignoring constitutional protections for reproductive rights that have been upheld by the United States Supreme Court for nearly 40 years and threatening women's health and lives,\" said Nancy Northup, the center's president and CEO. \n \n Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery, who was sued as part of the challenge, said there was no telling whether the appeals court would prevent the law from taking effect. Commenting on Monday's decision, Montgomery said, \"I thought it was sound legal reasoning and reached the appropriate conclusion.\" \n \n Brewer also lauded the ruling, saying in a statement that it protects women and children. \n \n Teilborg held a hearing Wednesday on a request from abortion-rights groups that he temporarily block the law's enforcement. \n \n The groups' lawyer said during the hearing that the ban crosses a clear line on what U.S. Supreme Court rulings permit, and it intrudes on women's health decisions at a key point in pregnancy. Montgomery argued the state Legislature was justified in enacting the ban to protect the health of women and to shield fetuses from pain. \n \n A second Arizona anti-abortion law enacted earlier this year also faces a court challenge. That law would bar public funding for non-abortion health care provided by abortion doctors and clinics. \n \n The anti-abortion laws are among many approved by Arizona's Republican-led Legislature. The other laws include restrictions on clinic operations, mandates for specific disclosures and a prohibition on a type of late-term abortion. \n \n Attorney Janet Crepps of the Center for Reproductive Rights argued at Wednesday's hearing that under Supreme Court decisions starting with the 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling that legalized abortion, states can only regulate how abortions are performed, not ban them, before a fetus is viable. \n \n Montgomery said that not implementing the 20-week ban would doom fetuses that might be saved due to advances in medicine. \n \n While North Carolina has long had a 20-week ban, Nebraska in 2010 was the first state to recently enact one. Five more states followed in 2010: Alabama, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas and Oklahoma. \n \n Along with Arizona, Georgia and Louisiana approved 20-week bans this year, though Georgia's law doesn't take effect until 2013. \n \n The Center for Reproductive Rights said none of the 20-week bans have so far been blocked by courts.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Arizona's new law banning abortions beginning at what the state defines as 20 weeks of pregnancy is constitutional, a US district judge has ruled, setting the stage for the law to go into effect this week.

He also said the state provided \"substantial and well-documented\" evidence that a fetus can feel pain by at least 20 weeks gestation, reports AP. The ban is set to go into effect for all women except in cases of medical emergencies on Thursday. The New York-based Center for Reproductive Rights has filed a notice that it plans to appeal the decision to the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals, but it's not clear if that will hold up the law. The law will complicate \"fetal defect\" cases in which a number of babies with fatal problems must now be carried to term but will likely die in minutes or days after birth, reports the Arizona Republic. The new law forbids doctors from aborting most fetuses with a gestational age of 20 weeks or older, even in situations where the doctor discovers the fetus has such a defect. But the law defines gestational age as beginning with the first day of a woman's last period, which means most fetuses will typically have an actual gestational age of 18 weeks when abortions can no longer be performed. That's about the time ultrasound tests are conducted to detect abnormalities, notes the Republic.",

Authorities were called to an area of Fort Myers Beach on Monday and found Hutchinson dead, with gunshot wounds. \n \n Authorities aren't aware of any connection between the two women, but they believe Riess shot and killed Hutchinson to assume her identity. \n \n \"Ms. Hutchinson's purse was found to be in disarray and all cash, credit cards and identification appeared to be removed,\" Lee County Undersheriff Carmine Marceno said, adding: \"Further investigation revealed that Ms. Hutchinson was targeted by the suspect due to the similarities in their appearance.\" \n \n Riess is believed to be driving Hutchinson's car, a white Acura TL with Florida license plate Y37TAA. The car has been seen in Louisiana and Corpus Christi, Texas, since Hutchinson died.

Her current whereabouts are unknown. \n \n \"Riess's mode of operation is to befriend women who resemble her and steal their identity,\" Marceno said. \"U.S. Marshals are actively involved in a national search for this dangerous fugitive. Riess is considered armed and dangerous and should not be approached if located.\" \n \n Riess is also wanted in the March death of her husband, David Riess.

The researchers warn that many women who sought fertility help may have been wrongly told their failure to get pregnant was down to having their appendix removed. \n \n \u201cFor many years medical students were taught that appendectomy had a negative effect on fertility and young women often feared that having their appendix removed threatened their chances of later becoming pregnant,\u201d said Sami Shimi, Clinical Senior Lecturer in the School of Medicine at the University of Dundee and a consultant surgeon with NHS Tayside. \n \n \u201cWe have found that women who have had an appendectomy or tonsillectomy, or even more particularly both, are more likely to become pregnant, and sooner than the rest of the general population. \n \n \u201cThis scientifically challenges the myth of the effect of appendectomy on fertility. What we have to establish now is exactly why that is the case.\u201d \n \n Mr Shimi said it was possible that women who suffered from appendix problems may simply have more sexual intercourse, which can cause pelvic inflammation. But reducing inflammation in the pelvis through an appendectomy could reverse any problems, making pregnancy easier. ||||| (CNN) Have you had your tonsils or appendix removed? If you have and you're a woman, you probably weren't told that the surgery may have increased your chances of having a baby. \n \n In fact, you may have been told the opposite. \n \n But a new 15-year study found that women who had their tonsils or appendix removed when they were young are more likely to get pregnant -- and to do so earlier in life. \n \n The reasons behind the link are not fully understood. \n \n Researchers at the University of Dundee examined the medical records of more than 530,000 women across the United Kingdom and found pregnancy rates to be higher among women who had had their tonsils or appendix removed. Pregnancies were even higher among people missing both. \n \n Rates of pregnancy among women without an appendix or tonsils were 54% and 53%, respectively, and rates in women lacking both parts of their body were 59%. This was higher than pregnancies among the group representing the rest of the population, which was almost 44%. \n \n The findings go against previous theories in medicine that these surgeries, particularly appendectomies, reduce chances of fertility due to scar tissue forming around a woman's fallopian tubes, where her eggs travel. \n \n \"The study has challenged the myth that was previously accepted on the deleterious effects of appendectomies,\" said Dr. Sami Shimi , a consultant surgeon and clinical lecturer in surgery at the University of Dundee who led the study. \"Young women should not have any fear or anxiety about an appendectomy (or tonsillectomy) reducing their fertility.\" \n \n The current research follows a report in 2012 that linked appendectomies to higher rates of pregnancy. The new study backs this previous insight on a wider scale but added the extra association with tonsillectomies and people who have undergone both surgeries. \n \n Biology or behavior? \n \n It's hoped the findings will reassure women who need these surgeries, but the researchers are now eager to understand why fertility was seen to increase. \n \n \"We now need to find the mechanism,\" Shimi said. He believes there could be either a biological or behavioral reason behind it. \"We're not discounting either for now.\" \n \n The biological contender is the idea that inflammation within the body from a continually inflamed appendix, or tonsils, puts strain and burden on the body, weakening it and potentially reducing chances of conception. \n \n Alternatively, Shimi suggests that increased promiscuity among some women, and therefore increased contact and intimacy -- through kissing or sex -- may directly increase chances of tonsillitis or else chances of abdominal infection. The latter would not cause appendicitis as such but could lead to more abdominal infections or pain, which is more likely to lead to hospital referrals and investigations in which an inflamed appendix may be spotted more readily. \n \n Both options need further investigation. \n \n \"It's a very interesting association they've shown here,\" said Richard Anderson , professor of clinical reproductive science at the University of Edinburgh, who wasn't involved in the new study. \"The issue is that it's purely an association.\" \n \n Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter. \n \n Anderson warns that people may believe that the two factors -- the surgeries and fertility -- are causally linked, but \"there's no evidence of that here.\" He added that the real question now is whether women who undergo these surgeries are more fertile or whether they are more likely to get pregnant at a younger age. \n \n \"Tonsillectomies are rare these days,\" he added. \"It's whether women who chose to have their tonsils removed (rather than ongoing rounds of antibiotics) are also choosing to fall pregnant more often.\" \n \n Both Anderson and Shimi agree that the findings should instead be used to reassure women who need the surgeries and that those wanting to improve their fertility should not request to have them. \n \n \"Young women should not seek appendectomies or tonsillectomies to increase their chances of pregnancy,\" Shimi said. \"But if they need one, the operation will not reduce their future chances of pregnancy.\" ||||| OBJECTIVE: \n \n To study pregnancy rates after appendectomy and/or tonsillectomy. \n \n DESIGN: \n \n Population-based cohort study using the United Kingdom (U.K.) primary health care-based Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). \n \n SETTING: \n \n Not applicable. \n \n PATIENT(S): \n \n Female patients who underwent appendectomy, tonsillectomy, or both from 1987 to 2012 and appropriate comparators. \n \n INTERVENTION(S): \n \n Timed follow-up until first pregnancy after surgery.

(AP Photo/Mel Evans) (Associated Press) \n \n PARAMUS, N.J. (AP) \u2014 To his right was the silver trophy Bryson DeChambeau won Sunday at The Northern Trust, a victory that felt comfortable to everyone but him. To his left was the silver FedEx Cup trophy, a reminder of the ultimate prize in the PGA Tour season. \n \n Missing was the gold Ryder Cup trophy. \n \n DeChambeau took a giant step toward playing for that, too. \n \n \"Like I said yesterday, I'm a man on a mission right now \u2014 two missions, actually,\" DeChambeau said after a four-shot victory in the opening FedEx Cup playoff event. \"One being the Ryder Cup and one being the FedEx Cup. I'm doing pretty well right now and just got to keep moving forward in the right direction.\" \n \n That was the only direction his game went in a final round devoid of much drama. \n \n Staked to a four-shot lead, DeChambeau never let anyone closer than two shots, ended the threat with consecutive birdies and closed with a 2-under 69 to win by four shots over Tony Finau, who also had the Ryder Cup on his mind. \n \n DeChambeau never felt entirely in control until he stabbed at a chip short of the 12th green \u2014 a shot he had worked on all week and used that one time \u2014 that rolled out to 4 feet for a birdie that turned back his only threat. \n \n His only wild shot was on the 18th hole, sending his drive so far to the right that landed in the fairway of a hole that wasn't being used at Ridgewood Country Club. He still had a good angle to the green, made par and finished at 18-under 266. \n \n He won for the second time this year, both against some of the strongest fields. He moved to the top of the FedEx Cup standings and is virtually assured of being one of the top five seeds at the Tour Championship who have a clear shot at the $10 million bonus. \n \n Also on his mind is playing for no money at all at the Ryder Cup. \n \n DeChambeau narrowly missed earning one of the eight automatic spots for the U.S. team when he missed the cut at the PGA Championship. Jim Furyk makes three of his four captain's picks a week from Tuesday, and it will be tough to ignore a 24-year-old Californian with victories at the Memorial and a FedEx Cup playoff event. \n \n \"Hopefully he can see that I've got some grit and grind, and that even when I don't execute certain shots, I can get it done,\" DeChambeau said. \n \n DeChambeau, who stayed on the practice range until it was dark Saturday night, came out firing with two straight birdies to stretch the lead to six shots. His only mistakes were a pair of three-putt bogeys on the front nine, the second one at No. 9 that reduced his lead to two shots over Aaron Wise. \n \n But not for long. \n \n Wise's threat ended with a bogey on No. 16, about the time DeChambeau got up-and-down with that chip from just short of the reachable par-4 12th for birdie. \n \n No one got any closer the rest of the way. \n \n Finau also made a strong statement about a captain's pick. Furyk invited Finau to join a small group of Americans who played Le Golf Nacional the weekend before the British Open. He was playing with Furyk at the PGA Championship when Finau tied a tournament record with 10 birdies in the second round. \n \n And while he stared five shots back on a course where the greens were as firm as they have been all week, Finau closed with a 68 to finish alone in second. Finau cracked the top 20 in the world (No. 18) for the first time in his career. \n \n \"If I'm in the conversation, this doesn't hurt my chances, I don't believe,\" Finau said. \"I had a solid week all around. My game feels good and I feel confident. Whatever his decision is, I'll be ready to play.\" \n \n Tiger Woods, coming off a runner-up finish at the PGA Championship, never got anything going. He closed with a 70 and tied for 40th, 14 shots out of the lead. \n \n \"I'm sure you guys are used to seeing me win five times a year or more,\" Woods said. \"It's not that easy to win out here. What you're seeing is that I'm close, and just one shot here, one shot there per day, flips momentum.\" \n \n Woods has played plenty of practice rounds with DeChambeau and is a strong advocate for adding him to the U.S. team that goes to France at the end of September. \n \n \"The guy is fiery,\" Woods said. \"He's competitive, and we want guys like that. It's going to be a tough environment, so we want guys that are mentally tough and can handle it.\" \n \n Billy Horschel (68) and Cameron Smith (69) tied for third. \n \n Ryan Palmer also felt like a winner. He came into the FedEx Cup playoffs at No. 100 \u2014 the top 100 advance to the second stage next week at the TPC Boston \u2014 and Palmer delivered a 65 on Sunday highlighted by a wedge he holed for eagle on the par-5 third hole. He tied for fifth, along with Wise (67) and Adam Scott (69), and moved all the way to No. 50. \n \n Dustin Johnson's only consolation was four birdies over the final four holes for a 68 that enabled him to stay No. 1 in the world by the narrowest of margins over U.S. Open and PGA champion Brooks Koepka. \n \n Nick Watney was among six players who moved from outside the top 100 to advance to the Dell Technologies Championship, which starts Friday. The others were Scott Stallings, Jhonattan Vegas, Bronson Burgoon, Brian Stuard and Danny Lee. ||||| Tiger Woods comments on his relationship with President Donald Trump and believes you have to respect the office. (0:51) \n \n Tiger on Trump: 'We all must respect the office' (0:51) \n \n PARAMUS, N.J. -- Tiger Woods did his best to stay clear of controversy Sunday when he was asked after the final round of the Northern Trust about his relationship with President Donald Trump. \n \n Woods has played golf with Trump, including after he was elected in 2016 and again last year at Thanksgiving with golfers Dustin Johnson and Brad Faxon. \n \n \"Well, I've known Donald for a number of years,'' Woods said during a post-round interview at Ridgewood Country Club. \"We've played golf together. We've had dinner together. I've known him pre-presidency and obviously during his presidency.'' \n \n Editor's Picks Tiger finishes in 40th, minimizes putting woes Tiger Woods finished his first FedEx Cup playoff event in five years on Sunday at Ridgewood Country Club pretty much the way it began -- unable to explain a dearth of birdies and poor putting while shooting a 1-under-par 70. \n \n DeChambeau wins FedEx Cup playoff opener Bryson DeChambeau cruised to a four-shot win in The Northern Trust on Sunday, moving atop the FedEx Cup standings. He's hoping to be a captain's pick for the U.S. Ryder Cup team when Jim Furyk announces three of his choices a week from Tuesday. 1 Related \n \n When pressed about some people being threatened by Trump \"and his policy,'' as well as Woods' seemingly friendly relationship with the president, Woods said: \n \n \"Well, he's the president of the United States. You have to respect the office. No matter who is in the office, you may like, dislike personality or the politics, but we all must respect the office.'' \n \n Asked if he had any more to say about the state and discourse of race relations, Woods said: \"No. I just finished 72 holes and am really hungry.'' \n \n Trump weighed in Monday morning on Twitter, praising Woods' answers and recent play. \n \n The Fake News Media worked hard to get Tiger Woods to say something that he didn't want to say. Tiger wouldn't play the game - he is very smart. More importantly, he is playing great golf again! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 27, 2018 \n \n Woods has played golf with former presidents George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, the latter both in and out of office. There were efforts to coordinate something with George W. Bush, but it never came together, as the president cut back on his golfing in his second term. \n \n Like Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Gary Player and Phil Mickelson, Woods has a villa named after him at Trump's Doral resort in Miami.",

She passed away earlier this week.\"She was an amazing woman. A very gentle, kind person,\" said longtime friend Ann Kenwood.Survived by her six children and 17 grandchildren, her family knew a normal obituary just wouldn't work for an extraordinary woman.\"We wanted something that showed who she was,\" explained daughter Maryanne \"We said, how can we be like her and carry her pinkness across.\"The following are excerpts from the colorful death announcement.\"Go to church with a chicken sandwich in your purse.

    "document": "Under pressure over its longstanding ban on gays, the Boys Scouts of America is proposing to lift the ban for youth members but continue to exclude gays as adult leaders. \n \n The Scouts announced Friday that it would submit this proposal to the roughly 1,400 voting members of its National Council at a meeting in Texas the week of May 20. \n \n Earlier, the BSA had indicated it might give local Scout units the option of admitting gays as both youth members and adult leaders, or continuing to exclude them \n \n The BSA said Friday it changed course due in part to results of surveys sent out this year to members of the scouting community. \n \n Gay-rights groups have demanded a complete lifting of the ban. Some churches and conservative groups want it maintained. ||||| The statue of a scout stands in the entrance to Boy Scouts of America headquarters in Irving, Texas, February 5, 2013. \n \n NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Boy Scouts of America on Friday proposed lifting a ban on gay scouts but maintaining a prohibition on gay adults from leading troops, a compromise that attempts to end a fight that has split the century-old American institution into bitter factions. \n \n Reaction from scouting supporters ranged from outrage to limited approval. The biggest organization in scouts, the Mormon Church, said it was studying the proposal, leaving uncertain the outcome of a May vote by scout leaders that will set policy. Gay rights groups said continuing to bar gay adults was unacceptable, but they welcomed the change for youths. \n \n \"The general feeling is that this is a bad move,\" which could precipitate a major crisis, A.J. Smith, president of the Association of Baptists for Scouting, wrote in a website post, attempting to summarize Baptists' views. \"This is about a concerted effort to bring down a cultural icon. We must brace ourselves for the long haul on this one.\" \n \n The scouts' decision is a focal point of a heated gay rights debate in the United States, where polls show public opinion is fast moving toward greater acceptance and a core of social conservatives stridently oppose such change. \n \n In the coming months, the Supreme Court will rule on whether to strike down parts of a federal law that defines marriage as the union between a man and a woman. In 2011, the military repealed a ban on openly gay soldiers. \n \n The Boy Scouts proposal would create a situation where a gay youth could become a scout and then be forced to resign when he becomes an adult. \n \n Scout leaders in 2000 won a Supreme Court battle over the right to exclude gays. There are more than 2.6 million youth scouts and 1 million adults, with faith-based groups sponsoring 70 percent of scout units. \n \n If the resolution is approved, \"no youth may be denied membership in the Boy Scouts of America on the basis of sexual orientation or preference alone,\" Deron Smith, the organization's spokesman, told Reuters. \n \n But the policy is not changed for adults, the group said, and an internal document obtained by Reuters says that when youth members become adults, they \"must meet the requirements of our adult standards\" to remain in the group. \n \n LONG STUDY BEFORE COMPROMISE \n \n Smith said a parents in three of four U.S. regions opposed the current membership policy. \n \n A report on the matter found religious groups linked to the Scouts were concerned with homosexual adult leaders, not with youth, and concluded \"a change in the membership policy specific to youth only would be consistent with the religious beliefs of the BSA's major chartered organizations.\" \n \n AT&T; Chief Executive and Chairman Randall Stephenson, a Boy Scouts board member who had called for allowing gays scouts and a key corporate advocate on the issue, endorsed the new policy on youths but did not comment on banning gay adults. \n \n \"I fully support the BSA Executive Council's resolution to ensure all youth have the opportunity to participate in scouting and benefit from the life-long leadership skills scouting helps develop,\" he said in a statement. \n \n Gay rights groups were quick to say the decision was not far-reaching enough. \n \n \"By refusing to consider an end to its ban on gay and lesbian parents, the Boy Scouts have missed an opportunity to exercise leadership and usher the organization back to relevancy,\" said Rich Ferraro, a spokesperson for GLAAD, which promotes lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights. \n \n The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Mormon church, which has more than 430,000 youths in scouts, \"will take the time needed to fully review the language and study the implications of this new proposal,\" spokesman Michael Purdy said. \n \n The Mormon church has consistently opposed gay marriage, and was a primary promoter of California's 2008 ban, known as Proposition 8. But recently it has emphasized respecting gay church members and declared that homosexuality is not a choice, reflecting changing attitudes among members. \n \n \"This was an exceptionally difficult decision as a business,\" said Patrick Boyle, whose 1994 book \"Scout's Honor\" examined sexual abuse in the Boy Scouts of America. \n \n \"They were stuck in a very bad spot with their constituents divided - constituents being the parents, and also the churches and the businesses that support the scouts.\" \n \n The road to a decision has been long. In July 2012, the group's board voted to uphold the gay ban. Six months later, group leaders said they were mulling over whether to remove the national restriction, leaving local branches to decide whether to admit gays and lesbians.

The organization today proposed doing away with the longstanding and controversial ban, which would mean that in the future, \"no youth may be denied membership in the Boy Scouts of America on the basis of sexual orientation or preference alone,\" a spokesperson tells Reuters. However, the proposal would continue to exclude gay adult leaders, the AP reports. The policy won't become official, however, unless the organization's National Council, which has 1,400 voting members, approves it at its meeting in Texas the week of May 20. This proposal comes on the heels of three months of research the Boy Scouts did, including surveys sent to members.",

    "document": "Engadget claims that Barnes & Noble is phasing out the 3G Nook. Does that mean a new Nook is coming? \n \n Gone baby gone? (Credit: Barnes & Noble) \n \n We're not sure quite what to make of this rumor, but Engadget is reporting that Barnes & Noble is phasing out the Nook 3G. \n \n Engadget doesn't cite a specific person or anonymous source, but says it, \"Received hard evidence from within B&N; that the Nook is being discontinued, with sales to seemingly continue until stock is exhausted.\" The \"outfit\" (we assume that means Barnes & Noble) is apparently \"encouraging retail partners to not send out any 'bulk requests' for the Nook 3G, as there simply 'will not be sufficient quantities to fulfill those orders.'\" \n \n The article then goes on to say that \"the company never actually received a huge amount of Nook 3G bulk orders to begin with, so maybe Wi-Fi really is everywhere these days.\" \n \n As we said, it's a little hard to decipher what this means, but we should point out that Engadget's story about the Nook Color getting an update to Android 2.2 and possibly blowing up if you rooted it (installed custom Android firmware) ended up being just a tad off base. However, this latest story was written by veteran Engadget reporter Darren Murph, so we're taking it more seriously. \n \n One thing worth pointing out is that it would seem odd for Barnes & Noble to discontinue the 3G/Wi-Fi version of the Nook and tell customers they could only get the Wi-Fi-only version. The fact is, Amazon offers both a 3G/Wi-Fi Kindle and Wi-Fi-only Kindle, and Barnes & Noble would most likely continue to offer models that compete with what Amazon's got. \n \n While Barnes & Noble remains heavily focused on marketing the Nook Color, the more likely scenario is for the company to refresh the Nook e-ink line, which launched in November 2009. Whether that ends up being a substantial makeover or just some modest design and parts tweaks is unclear, but some industry insiders say that Barnes & Noble may be losing money on its e-ink readers (which is why it hasn't quite matched Amazon's prices). Therefore it would behoove the company to release a product that was more cost-effective to produce. \n \n In any case, we think that Barnes & Noble will continue to offer some sort of sub-$200 3G-enabled Nook as long as Amazon is offering one. But to be clear, that's just speculation. We have no \"hard evidence\" to prove some change is coming to the Nook line, and Barnes & Noble doesn't comment on rumors. \n \n Update: A Barnes & Noble rep told us that the Nook 3G sold very well during the holidays and remains on sale both in Barnes & Noble stores and in its retail partners stores. She would not comment on the Nook \"roadmap\" going forward. ||||| When it comes to eReaders, it looks like customers prefer to have a WiFi-only model. Despite Barnes & Noble's Nook product line showing all-time sales highs (thanks in no small part to the uber-popular Nook Color), the e-ink Nook 3G is apparently about to be discontinued, according to an Engadget tipster. Sales will continue until supply is depleted, but after that, don't expect to see any more of these. \n \n As eReaders only need data connections for downloading books (usually not something you'll do everyday) and syncing, it makes perfect sense that more customers opt for a cheaper WiFi model. \n \n It's been a slice, Nook 3G. [Engadget]",

The Churchill fiver, which goes into circulation in September, will be the first of a series of new plastic notes, followed by the Jane Austen \u00a310 next year and the JMW Turner \u00a320 by 2020. \n \n Manufactured from a transparent plastic film and coated with an ink layer, polymer banknotes are seen as cleaner, more durable and more secure than paper. The material allows the inclusion of clear \u201cwindows\u201d to protect against counterfeits. \n \n The faces of Britain's banknotes \u2013 in pictures Read more \n \n They are also more environmentally friendly than paper because they can last up to two-and-a-half times longer, according to the Bank of England. It claims that the durability will offset the higher production costs and save an estimated \u00a3100m. \n \n The Bank\u2019s laboratory tests showed polymer banknotes only begin to shrink and melt at 120C, so they are expected to survive a washing machine spin cycle \u2013 although they could be damaged by a hot iron. \n \n The move to polymer notes will land shops and banks with a bill of up to \u00a3236m, it has been estimated, because ATMs, vending machines and self-service machines will need to be recalibrated to take the new plastic notes, which are 15% smaller than the current notes.

News in 2013 that she would be replaced with the former prime minister sparked an outcry as it meant that, apart from the Queen, there would be no female figures on British banknotes. A few months later the Bank announced that writer Jane Austen would be the next face of the \u00a310 note. \n \n \n \n Churchill will be pictured alongside a view of Westminster with Big Ben showing 3 o\u2019clock \u2013 the approximate time on 13 May 1940 when Churchill declared in a speech: \u201cI have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat.\u201d \n \n \u2022 This article was amended on 3 June 2016.

Increasingly, it\u2019s plainclothes contractors with few labor protections, driving their own cars, competing for shifts on the company\u2019s own Uber-like platform. Though it\u2019s deployed in dozens of cities and associated with one of the world\u2019s biggest companies, government agencies and customers alike are nearly oblivious to the program\u2019s existence. \n \n \n \n In terms of size, efficiency, and ruthlessness, Amazon has few equals. The least publicly accountable of the big tech companies\u2014Google, Apple, and Facebook face considerably greater scrutiny\u2014Amazon\u2019s stock is one of the most valuable on the market, it\u2019s among the fastest-growing companies in the United States. Atop its vast empire, CEO Jeff Bezos commands the single largest personal fortune on the planet. Estimates place Amazon as the recipient of approximately one third of all dollars spent online. Control over the manufacture, storage, sales, and shipping of an extraordinarily diverse set of products has led the company to expand into film and TV production, web hosting, publishing, groceries, fashion, space travel, wind farms, and soon, pharmaceuticals, to name just a few. It\u2019s a new kind of company, the likes of which the American economy has never before seen and is legislatively ill-prepared for. \n \n Ingenuity alone doesn\u2019t account for Amazon\u2019s dominant position. The company\u2019s Economic Development Team works hard to secure state and local subsidies, which research from watchdog group Good Jobs First indicates surpasses $1 billion, a figure which the advocacy group\u2019s executive director, Greg LeRoy, freely admitted to Gizmodo is far from comprehensive. Infrastructure in the company\u2019s home base of Seattle has strained to keep pace with Amazon\u2019s meteoric growth, and the city has experienced massive increases in housing costs. While North America\u2019s metro areas\u2014including Seattle\u2014scramble to offer attractive incentives to host Bezos\u2019s second headquarters, research indicates that when Amazon comes to town, it might be killing more jobs than it creates. \n \n The majority of consumers, however, either don\u2019t know or don\u2019t care. Strip Amazon to its most familiar elements, and it\u2019s a devilishly simple everything-store with limitless stuff-supply. You buy it. It shows up.

It\u2019s a network of supposedly self-employed, utterly expendable couriers enrolled in an app-based program which some believe may violate labor laws. That program is called Amazon Flex, and it accomplishes Amazon\u2019s \u201clast-mile\u201d deliveries\u2014the final journey from a local facility to the customer. \n \n Advertisement \n \n While investigating the nature of the program, we spoke to 15 current or former independent drivers across nine states and two countries whose enrollment spanned between a few weeks and two years, as well as three individuals attached to local courier companies delivering for Amazon. Their identities have all been obscured for fear of retribution. \n \n A great opportunity to be your own boss \n \n To understand the issues faced by the independent contractors handling last-mile delivery for Amazon requires some knowledge of how Flex works. \n \n When Amazon selects one of its facilities\u2014what drivers refer to as a Fulfillment Center* (FC)\u2014 for participation in Flex, it blankets Craigslist and other sites with local ads describing Flex as \u201ca great opportunity to be your own boss,\u201d sometimes as many as twelve ads a day. Each FC is distinguished by three letters and a number\u2014DLA5, for instance, refers to Riverside, California\u2014and many of the over 50 cities Flex operates in have more than one. \n \n An interested driver goes through a preliminary screening online and finishes their application through the app, passes a background check allegedly administered by a company called Accurate Background. Accurate Background did not respond to multiple requests for comment and Amazon declined to comment on which companies or services it uses for this purpose, but claimed the check pulls from, among other signals, court records, the sex offender registry, and data analysis from US and global organizations. One driver told Gizmodo he was approved in under four hours. Others wait over a month. According to a Flex contract furnished to Gizmodo, the only requirements to entry are modest: be 21 or older, pass Accurate Background\u2019s vetting, own a smartphone with Flex installed, and have access to a car, bike, or public transportation. No company cars. No uniforms. Just a non-photo ID badge. \n \n The training is similarly minimal. One driver attended an optional hour-long training at an FC.

The consistent element reported to Gizmodo was being made to watch approximately 20 videos which fresh Flexers view from the comfort of their phones. \u201cWatch videos of their expectations of you and their rules, agree to the rules,\u201d a Georgia-based driver said. \u201cThat\u2019s about it.\u201d No drivers reported being trained on matters of workplace safety, and as one UK-based driver succinctly put it, \u201chonestly it seems they take on anyone.\u201d Amazon declined to describe its Flex driver training except to say that videos were among the materials used in onboarding. \n \n Work is secured by grabbing \u201cblocks\u201d through the app, measured in hours, with an associated route and payout. Flex\u2019s blocks cover multiple local arms of Amazon\u2014including Fresh and Restaurants\u2014but the two most common, based on individual testimony and online posts, are Logistics, which covers standard packages, and Prime Now which handles same-day purchases. Regardless, the procedure is largely the same once a driver lands a block: get in line behind the other cars at the FC, check in, receive a pre-sorted rolling cart or shelf of goods for the route, scan and pack them into the car, then follow the Flex app\u2019s \u201csuggested\u201d driving directions to each stop. \n \n Advertisement \n \n A driver sharing his experience with and tips for Flex on YouTube \n \n Block length and package count vary considerably between Prime Now and Logistics: Prime Now blocks can be as little as two hours, while five hour blocks have reportedly been offered to Logistics drivers with larger vehicles; 15 packages for a slim Prime Now block and as many as 90 on a Logistics run. Amazon\u2019s own Craigslist ads show compensation varies by location, but among the drivers Gizmodo spoke to, pay averaged $20.50/hr\u2014not bad by the standards of the gig economy. And similar to Uber\u2019s \u201csurge pricing\u201d in the rare event that blocks go unclaimed, Amazon will sometimes increase to incentivize drivers to accept it. Still, all but three drivers we spoke to did not consider Flex their primary means of income, and of those who did one also contracts with UberEats and Grubhub, another was seeking additional work, and the third alleged to have been deactivated by Amazon despite delivering through floodwaters in the wake of Hurricane Irma. \n \n \n \n Arguably Amazon Flex, like Uber, is best used as supplemental income, and for many drivers it works well for that purpose. For others it\u2019s a necessity. In major cities like New York and San Francisco\u2014coincidentally located in the states that employ the largest numbers of couriers\u2014Uber can be a living. Flex can\u2019t. \n \n A difficult road \n \n Despite being able to fulfill hundreds of millions of orders per year, drivers report Amazon\u2019s data at the local level can be lacking, leading to misalignments between block times and package numbers. \u201cThe block that I signed up for was four hours, but when I got to the facility they were struggling to find something for me to do, so I only ended up having three packages to deliver,\u201d a driver told Gizmodo of a recent block picked up from a newly-opened FC. But according to a more veteran driver, Amazon\u2019s bad bets cut both ways. \u201cThey won\u2019t pay you for working over your allotted block time,\u201d he told Gizmodo. \u201cThey said it evens out because when you work a three hour block and finish in two they still pay you for three, but it doesn\u2019t even out.\u201d Another alleged that Amazon\u2019s systems struggle to estimate door-to-door time or handling large apartment buildings, leading to a \u201c99% probability that you will exceed your block end time.\u201d \n \n \n \n Additionally, two drivers in completely different regions of the US both claimed Flexers\u2019 hours are capped at 40 hours per week. \u201cAs [independent contractors], we should be able to work as much as we wish since we take the blocks we want to work. It used to not be this way when I first started working for them,\u201d the San Antonio-based driver bemoaned. But lately, drivers at a number of FCs have found it harder and harder to secure enough hours for 40 hours to be a meaningful limitation. A Philadelphia-based driver told Gizmodo, \u201cLast year when I started it was easy to secure two four hour blocks a day and I was complaining that they would put us on payroll locks so I wouldn\u2019t exceed 40 hours a week. How times have changed!\u201d Demand for those blocks and the desire to finish them quickly led to what one driver described as \u201cphysical fights [...] when someone tries to jump the line.\u201d \n \n Advertisement \n \n Amazon would not comment on whether it caps drivers\u2019 hours, but characterized the program as a part-time opportunity. It claimed, in a statement to Gizmodo, that it \u201creceived overwhelmingly positive response[s] from drivers participating in the program.\u201d The company also suggested that workers seeking more traditional full-time arrangements are encouraged to apply elsewhere within Amazon. \n \n A number of drivers have alleged they\u2019re reprimanded by FC workers if their vehicles are unable to fit all the packages for a block, and fear being \u201cticketed\u201d for returning packages they weren\u2019t able to deliver. One reported getting written up by one FC employee for following the explicit instructions of another. \n \n While in and of themselves these incidents tend not to have serious repercussions, as little as two incidents have led to drivers being deactivated. Amazon told Gizmodo that it has performance expectations for its contractors which it expects them to meet or exceed, and sometimes those metrics are used to justify a termination. Other times, being notified your time with Amazon Flex has ended comes as a vague boilerplate email about violating the program\u2019s terms of service. \n \n \n \n A Flex contract provided to Gizmodo states that drivers \u201cmay provide Amazon with data about your use of such Licensed Materials, your geo-location and related tracking data, including your location, movements, speed at which you are traveling, and other personally identifiable information,\u201d and that \u201c if you choose to deny Amazon access to this information, this could affect the availability and functionality of the Amazon Flex App and your participation in the Program.\u201d Presumably, this data is used to increase the company\u2019s own routing efficiency. While Amazon does not pay drivers for work if it exceeds a given block\u2019s time, it\u2019s unclear if Flex continues to track drivers while off-hours. \n \n \n \n Lack of oversight and scarcity of work through Flex have caused cheating to proliferate. Drivers turn to auto-tap applications like FRep and Repetitouch to scoop up blocks much faster than human fingers are capable of, and once these practices become widespread at an FC, more scrupulous drivers either stoop to these methods or accept that regular hours won\u2019t be possible. Though nearly every Flexer we contacted was familiar with the use of these types of software only one admitted to using it personally. \u201cMost drivers at my warehouse are using some form of bot or macro to secure blocks, including myself,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThough Amazon recently sent out a threatening email regarding their use (threatening to terminate us for using them). That email is the main reason why I\u2019ve cut back on my own use of them.\u201d Video uploaded to YouTube even appears to show one such app running on an iPhone left charging inside inside a Fulfillment Center, screen blinking away at a feverish pace. Amazon told Gizmodo such software violates its Terms of Service. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Neither FRep or Repetitouch were built specifically for Flex, according to their respective creators. \u201cFrom what I heard, there are people who heavily rely on it for their income and apparently there\u2019s a lot of competition for jobs in general. Thus, I\u2019m not surprised that some Flex drivers try to get an edge,\u201d Erwin Goslawski, the German student behind Reptitouch told Gizmodo. \u201cI can imagine that this makes it rather difficult for other users to grab jobs, however, which makes it more likely that more and more users decide to use such tools.\u201d Despite the enormous amount of access Amazon is afforded to its drivers\u2019 phones, \u201cbotting\u201d remains popular and poorly policed. At least one device was built specifically to increase the likeliness of landing blocks\u2014the Flexbot. It\u2019s creator, a former driver named Tim McDaniel who suffers from arthritis, claims to have made it \u201cjust to level the playing field to able-bodied folks,\u201d though certainly some of the customers who have paid $130 for the contraption\u2014a pair of Arduino-controlled mechanical fingers\u2014do so to avoid detection by Amazon\u2019s software. Unlike software alternatives, Amazon told Gizmodo that Flexbot does not violate its terms of service. McDaniel originally sold Flexbot 6 on Amazon, but had his account shut down after he \u201cfell behind on customer relations.\u201d \n \n Add to this a general sense of disorder, from simple issues of whether or not Flexers are allowed to drive with passengers, to integral aspects of the gig like when new blocks become available. \u201cWhen Flex first started all blocks were released at 10 PM. Then they changed to all blocks being released exactly 24 hours in advance. Now they have changed to completely random times,\u201d one driver told Gizmodo. \u201cThis causes us to have to constantly use our phone to look for blocks and waste time that we are not being paid for just to find work.\u201d \n \n There\u2019s no easy way for this disposable workforce to have their problems addressed. While drivers are given a support number, Flexers claim its only purpose is to assist during the course of a block\u2014to get the door code to an apartment building, for instance. \u201cThere\u2019s no liaison, just hot-headed warehouse managers that will terminate a driver for anything they want,\u201d a driver reported. And from other testimony, terminations occur frequently and with little explanation. Boilerplate emails reprimanding drivers for supposedly missed packages contain little information: only the date of the infraction, but not the package or address. Whether the package was stolen or an unscrupulous customer merely took advantage of Amazon\u2019s willingness to offer refunds, it\u2019s the courier who takes the fall. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating because Amazon will always believe the customer,\u201d a driver claimed, echoing the sentiments of many others. \u201cEven with photo or bodycam evidence. We have no support. And one customer too many and we\u2019ll get that termination email.\u201d \n \n To combat confusing rules\u2014due both to changes in the program over time and quirks of individual FCs\u2014drivers tend to share information over closed Facebook groups, Reddit, and gig economy forum Uberpeople. The largest of these boasts a membership of over 20,000. According to a moderator of one such community, a change in the Flex program takes place approximately every six weeks, sometimes buried inside a Terms of Service update. Many of the posts in these digital break rooms can be summarized as: Here\u2019s what happened to me. Is this normal? But no matter how experienced, the advice of other, equally powerless people can only go so far in certain situations. \n \n \n \n Advertisement \n \n So where can a driver go to resolve an issue or dispute their termination? That leaves one final option: Flex\u2019s reviled support email line. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s as if they scan it for keywords and then have a copy-and-paste type response to everything,\u201d a Detroit-based driver told Gizmodo. \u201cLiterally I got the same email twice.\u201d Unfortunately this appears to be a common occurrence. \n \n Flex, as part of a pilot program Amazon is rumored to be using to take on UPS, Fedex and others, is a constantly shifting set of systems with a number of redundancies. Besides drivers, some cities also employ motor scooter couriers and\u2014in Manhattan at least\u2014\u201cJohnny walkers\u201d who gather around delivery trucks and roll their packages to buildings on foot. But by far the biggest threat to self-employed Flexers (and vice versa) are \u201cwhite vans\u201d\u2014third-party local couriers Amazon also contracts to do last-mile work. \n \n Joining the fleet \n \n The arrangement is virtually the same as Flex, only scaled up to accommodate bigger vans and larger package counts\u2014as many as 270 per run, according to one source\u2014and with pay going to the company to distribute as it sees fit, rather than to individual drivers. The major draw for Amazon\u2014though it declined to comment on most aspects of these local business arrangements\u2014appears to be the ability to count on a reliable number of couriers all capable of hauling an equally reliable volume (300 cubic feet or large is the required van size) of parcels. \n \n Amazon considers these companies, just like individual Flexers, to be contractors, though drivers still have to run Amazon\u2019s software while working, and still have to pass a check from Accurate Background. \u201cWe have to background check the guys [that deliver Amazon packages]. We have to use their background check company. They won\u2019t even tell us what the criteria is,\u201d a California-based courier business owner said with clear frustration. A dispatcher for another last-mile courier claimed that applicants who don\u2019t pass Accurate Background\u2019s vetting simply aren\u2019t hired by the company he works for. UPS spokesman Dan McMackin told Gizmodo that Amazon is not a threat to UPS\u2014whose drivers are both full employees and the single largest contingent of long-lived Teamsters labor union\u2014because \u201cecommerce is bigger than one customer.\u201d In his opinion, good courier work requires a skilled, consistent workforce, and retaining that pool of labor means providing solidly middle-class wages and benefits. However much he claims to dislike doing business with large, often pushy customers, the California courier said he finally agreed work with a company like Amazon because, \u201cthe writing\u2019s on the wall that Amazon\u2019s gonna take over the whole delivery industry in the next ten years.\u201d \n \n \u201cThe writing\u2019s on the wall that Amazon\u2019s gonna take over the whole delivery industry in the next ten years.\u201d \n \n Advertisement \n \n Worryingly, courier company owners allege their drivers can be individually deactivated from using the Flex app. \u201cThey tier people out, it\u2019s called, because you get a tier one offense, you cannot log into the app anymore,\u201d the California boss claimed. \u201cAmazon does fire people.\u201d But deactivation is only the most extreme action within a larger scheme of control. \u201cFulfillment center managers control [...] what drivers can come, what can\u2019t,\u201d a New Jersey courier company owner told Gizmodo. \u201cIf you make a mistake in there, if you have a mouth on you and use curse words, they don\u2019t allow that whatsoever, and they\u2019ll take you out in a heartbeat. They\u2019ll even take out the whole company if they want to.\u201d \n \n That capriciousness, coupled with having significantly more at stake, also explains why, of the many dozens of courier companies advertising for Amazon route drivers, only three spoke to Gizmodo about working with Amazon. One company owner, who did not agree to answer questions about his relationship with Amazon, wrote back in an email that \u201canything Amazon related is really not up to me to accept on interview or not.\u201d Asked if such companies are under non-disclosure agreement, Amazon declined to comment. \n \n Worse still, Amazon has a history of contracting courier services that themselves subcontract their drivers, which led to it being named in lawsuits in 2015 (against Scoobeez) and 2016 (against Courier Logistics Services.) The complaints in these suits included failure to pay minimum wage, failure to compensate overtime, failure to provide meal periods, employee misclassification, and violations of the unfair competition law. Still, at least one recent hiring ad on Craigslist from a courier company explicitly sought independent contractors to run Amazon routes. \n \n Technically, all drivers in these arrangements are required by Amazon to be full employees of those local delivery outlets, not contractors like individual Flexers. Yet Amazon\u2019s background check policy insinuates itself into the hiring decisions these companies are able to make\u2014especially if Amazon is provides the lion\u2019s share of work for these local outfits\u2014and testimony around pushy FC workers and app deactivations suggests Amazon also wields the power to functionally fire drivers as well. Amazon declined to comment specifically on any facet of its arrangement with third-party couriers, except to confirm that they are subject to the same background checks. \n \n Over the limit \n \n \u201cI do think that Amazon is breaking the law. I think it\u2019s breaking the law in a pretty widespread way,\u201d Shannon Liss-Riordan, an attorney well known within courier circles for representing drivers from Lyft, Grubhub, Uber, and more recently few Amazon Flex, told Gizmodo. Though Amazon would likely disagree, the legality of the relatively new mass-contractor model remains an open question. \n \n \u201cI do think that Amazon is breaking the law. I think it\u2019s breaking the law in a pretty widespread way.\u201d \n \n Advertisement \n \n The way Liss-Riordan sees it, the issue at hand is labor misclassification: Amazon and similar companies pay drivers to do the work of employees, but treat them as independent contractors, denying them basic amenities like health care, benefits, and workers\u2019 compensation in the event of an on-the-job injury\u2014something which two of the drivers we spoke to reported experiencing. As Catherine Ruckelshaus, general counsel and program director for the National Employment Law Project, explained, the determination of whether a worker is doing the job of a contractor or employee comes down to a few key factors: among them, the right to control how the work is done, its permanence, the level of specialization required, and how integrated it is into the business paying for it. \n \n Some of the drivers we spoke to had run deliveries for Flex for up to two years, which suggests continuing rather than gig-based work. And where integration is concerned, the Prime Now arm of Flex is particularly suspect, in Ruckelshaus\u2019s opinion. \u201cIf Amazon\u2019s promoting one-day delivery, that\u2019s likely to be found to be integrated to Amazon\u2019s overall products or services that it\u2019s providing to customers,\u201d she said. \n \n Most damning though is Amazon\u2019s apparent level of micromanagement. \u201cIf something\u2019s relatively low-skill, you don\u2019t have to show that the company, like an Amazon, told them exactly \u2018take a left here, take a right there, drop this package off first,\u2019 they mostly just want you to go from A to B, get this thing done, they don\u2019t tell you how to get the thing done,\u201d Ruckelshaus said. \u201cSo if Amazon is actually taking that amount of detailed oversight and control, that\u2019s very powerful, strong evidence that it has the right to control because it\u2019s actually exercising control over pretty minute details of the job.\u201d \n \n If Amazon has been engaging in misclassification on a massive scale, why haven\u2019t there been lawsuits? Beyond the expense of retaining legal representation, Flex\u2019s terms of service also include an arbitration agreement which waives drivers\u2019 rights to a class-action lawsuit against Amazon. It\u2019s a common practice for comparable gigs, affecting some 25 million contracts. And though the version of the Flex contract made available to Gizmodo gives drivers the ability to opt out within two weeks of signing, it seems few do. Individual drivers looking to escalate an issue can\u2019t bring it to court, keeping whatever ruling might have resulted from becoming valuable case law. \n \n \u201cThese companies have been very effective at wielding their arbitration clauses,\u201d Liss-Riordan said. The result, in Ruckelshaus\u2019s view, is that \u201cthe company doesn\u2019t feel the heat because it doesn\u2019t have to pay off all of its drivers, it only has to pay off the ones that bring their claims, and then nobody else knows\u2014Did that guy win? What happened? It\u2019s harder to change the practices across an entire company when it\u2019s individual private arbitration.\u201d While drivers are free to opt in to Liss-Riordan\u2019s current Flex suit, the class-action gag keeps her from sending notice to driver who might benefit from joining. \n \n Compounding the difficulty of driver going up against a powerful and well-insulated company, of the governmental and regulatory regulatory agencies Gizmodo reached out to for comment on Amazon\u2019s business practices, few seem to have ever heard of the Flex program or have an official stance on it. Even the National Labor Relations Board, which by its own description \u201cacts to prevent and remedy unfair labor practices,\u201d declined to comment on Flex, and further declined to comment on whether or not Flex even fell under the purview of the agency. Mounting regulatory pressure against Uber may have led Instacart to start walking back it\u2019s contractor model, but no such outrage is directed at Flex, one imagines, because so few people even know it exists. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Both lawyers seemed most troubled to see these practices employed by a company of the size and wealth of Amazon. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad that Amazon is continuing to pursue these structures, because it doesn\u2019t have to. All it has to do is pay the minimum wage, that\u2019s all,\u201d Ruckelshaus said, sounding defeated. \u201cIt seems like they\u2019re jumping through a lot of hoops to avoid being an employer for not really a good economic reason.\u201d Similarly, Liss-Riordan, pointing to structural legal issues, said that \u201cdifficulties in enforcement are leading a company like Amazon, which is a major player and obviously could afford to do it right, to lead it to shift to a system where more and more of its drivers don\u2019t have the benefits of employment.\u201d \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s too bad that Amazon is continuing to pursue these structures, because it doesn\u2019t have to.\u201d \n \n Flex is indicative of two alarming trends: the unwillingness of legislators to curb harmful practices of tech behemoths run amok, and a shift towards less protected, more precarious opportunities in a stagnant job market. Under the current administration, it\u2019s unlikely either will receive the attention it deserves. There is a glimmer of hope for Liss-Riordan and the scores of Flexers she hopes to help though. On October 2nd, the US Supreme Court\u2019s new term began. Among its cases is one which will determine the legality of arbitration clauses like the one Amazon uses to shield itself against the drivers it refuses to acknowledge as employees. \n \n The constantly shifting, secretive nature of Amazon makes it difficult to report its activities to the public. If you have information about company, we\u2019d like to hear from you. Reach out to the author via email with tips or to request secure communications through Signal, Wickr, or SecureDrop. \n \n",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Amazon has an open secret that few pay heed to: a \"nearly invisible workforce\" that works to get consumers their packages on demand, per Gizmodo. Bryan Menegus dives into the company's Flex program, responsible for the firm's \"last-mile\" service, which involves getting ordered goods to a customer from the last local shipment site on the delivery chain. But while the driving program is described online by Amazon as letting those interested \"be your own boss, set your own schedule, and have more time to pursue your goals and dreams,\" Menegus\u2014who chatted with 15 current or ex-drivers from nine states and two countries, as well as with three contractors from local courier companies tied to Amazon\u2014instead paints it as an exploitive system that considers its drivers \"utterly expendable\" and offers them little recourse to address issues or unfair practices. What he found is that getting into the Flex program can be simple: Entry criteria are \"modest\" (e.g., being over 21, having a smartphone with the Flex app), as is training. One UK driver says: \"Honestly, it seems they take on anyone.\" But once on board, drivers say they face faulty data systems, altercations between drivers vying for prime routes (and high-tech cheating to claim those routes), and a lack of support from \"hot-headed warehouse managers\" who take a \"customer is always right\" attitude. And one labor attorney thinks not everything is on the up-and-up when it comes to how the company handles its drivers: considering them contractors, but treating them like employees, with all of the responsibility and few benefits. \"I think it's breaking the law in a pretty widespread way,\" she says.

Brian Peterson, who has asked for privacy, told a conference earlier this month that his office was dealing with more overdose deaths than murders, car accident deaths, and sleep-related infant deaths combined, the Journal Sentinel reports. \"We had a 1-year-old found dead on a mattress of methadone poisoning,\" Peterson told the round table. \"Unfortunately, that's not uncommon either.\" He described medical examiners as \"kind of the last responders,\" whose job it is \"to help with clean data to help everybody understand.\" \"I was sitting at the same table as Brian two weeks ago in Milwaukee discussing the trail of tragedies and heartbreak that addiction leaves in its wake,\" Sen. Ron Johnson tells the Journal Sentinel. \"No family is immune. My prayers go out to Brian and his family at this time. I will continue to fight this fight for all those who have lost loved ones.\" (This small city in West Virginia had to deal with 27 overdoses in less than five hours.)",

The sit-ins were set up by supporters of Mr Morsi's after he was overthrown by the military the previous month. \n \n The trial, at which more than three-quarters of the defendants were not present, is reported to have lasted less than an hour on Saturday. \n \n The prosecution did not put forward evidence implicating any individual defendant, even though it had compiled significant evidence, and the court prevented defence lawyers from presenting their case or calling witnesses, according to Human Right Watch. \n \n A second session was held on Monday solely to announce the verdict. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The 528 Morsi supporters sentenced to death on Monday were convicted of murder and damaging property, as Orla Guerin reports \n \n On Tuesday, a spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Rupert Colville, told a news conference in Geneva: \"The astounding number of people sentenced to death in this case is unprecedented in recent history.\" \n \n \"The mass imposition of the death penalty after a trial that was rife with procedural irregularities is in breach of international human rights law.\" \n \n Sixteen Egyptian rights groups voiced concern, saying the trial constituted a \"dangerous, unprecedented shift in the Egyptian's judiciary's treatment of such cases\" and represented \"a grave violation of both the right to a fair trial and the right to life\". \n \n But Egypt's interim government defended the court, insisting that the sentences had been handed down only \"after careful study\". \n \n The state-run al-Ahram newspaper said the court would issue its final verdict on 28 April after Egypt's grand mufti, who under the law must ratify each death sentence before it can be carried out, had passed judgement. \n \n The defendants may then appeal. Legal experts said a higher court would most probably order a retrial or reduce their sentences. \n \n Boycott \n \n Mr Colville also expressed concern about the 683 people who went on trial at the Minya Criminal Court on Tuesday on similar charges relating to an attack on another police station in which no-one died. \n \n The BBC's Orla Guerin, who is outside the courthouse, says that after an opening session lasting just a few hours the case was adjourned until 28 April, when the judge, Said Youssef, said a verdict would be given. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Head of Appeals Court Ahmed Midhat El-Maraghy: \"The court has the ultimate say in assessing the punishment and no one can interfere with that\" \n \n Critics will ask how the fate of so many people could be decided after the briefest of trials, our correspondent says. And, she adds, there were two key elements missing - most of the defendants and any of their lawyers. \n \n Only 62 defendants reportedly appeared in court, with officials saying Mr Badie and Mr Katatni could not attend for security reasons, while the defence team staged a boycott in protest at the preceding trial. \n \n \"As lawyers, we haven't seen anything like what happened here yesterday in our entire professional lives and we will not see anything like it until our deaths,\" Khaled Fouda of the Minya lawyers' syndicate said. \n \n Despite the boycott, the judge heard testimony from witnesses and questioning several of the defendants before adjourning the case. \n \n The wife of one of the accused in Tuesday's case told the BBC she feared the verdict had been decided in advance. She said her husband was an innocent man who had been arrested while picking up their daughter from hospital. \n \n The 1,200 defendants in the two cases in Minya are among more than 16,000 Egyptians arrested over the past eight months, according to figures recently provided by senior interior ministry officials. They include about 3,000 top or mid-level Brotherhood members. ||||| After a single session with no defence lawyers present, an Egyptian judge said Tuesday he will issue verdicts next month in a new mass trial of 683 suspected Islamists on charges of murder and attempted murder, a day after he sentenced hundreds to death in a similar trial that raised a storm of international criticism. \n \n The mass trials have raised deep concerns among human rights activists over the lack of due process as Egyptian authorities push swift and heavy prosecutions in their crackdown against Islamists and the Muslim Brotherhood. About 16,000 have been in arrested in the crackdown since the the military\u2019s ouster of President Mohammed Morsi last summer. \n \n Defence lawyers boycotted the trial that began Tuesday in the court in the city of Minya, south of Cairo, to protest the verdicts issued the day before in a separate trial. Despite the lawyer boycott, presiding judge Said Youssef went ahead with the session, hearing testimony, in what the lawyers called a violation of the law. \n \n After the five-hour hearing, the judge announced that he would issue verdicts in the case at the next session, set for April 28, according to judicial and security officials who attended the sessions and Mohammed Tosson, a defence lawyer who boycotted the session but present in the court building to monitor the results. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the proceedings. \n \n The 683 defendants, all but 68 of whom are being tried in absentia, could also face the death penalty in the case. Among the defendants is the top leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, Mohammed Badie, as well several other senior members of the group. Badie is in custody in Cairo but was not brought to the hearing in Minya for security reasons. \n \n If sentenced to death, Badie would be the most senior figure in the Brotherhood to receive such a sentence since a leading ideologue of the group, Sayed Qutb, was executed in 1966 \u2013 though any verdict against Badie would certainly be appealed. \n \n The previous mass trial that Youssef presided over also held only one session to hear testimony before he held a second session Monday to pronounce the verdicts. Defence lawyers said they were not allowed to present their case during the single session, and they were barred from Monday\u2019s hearing, when Youssef pronounced deaths sentenced for 528 of the defendants. \n \n The sentences are subject to appeal and even judicial officials involved in the case said they expect them to be overturned. \n \n But the verdicts stunned Egyptian human rights activists and brought international criticism on Egypt. On Tuesday, the United Nations human rights office called the mass death sentences \u201cunprecedented in recent history\u201d and \u201ca breach of international human rights law.\u201d \n \n The U.S. State Department said it \u201cdefies logic\u201d that so many defendants could have gotten a fair trial in two sessions. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier called the verdicts \u201cvery alarming\u201d and said \u201cfurther mass trials must be suspended.\u201d The European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, called on Egyptian officials to ensure \u201cdefendants\u2019 rights to a fair and timely trial.\u201d \n \n Sixteen Egyptian rights groups said they were \u201cextremely concerned\u201d about the court verdict, saying they constitute \u201ca dangerous, unprecedented shift in the Egyptian judiciary\u2019s treatment of such cases and represent a grave violation of both the right to a fair trial and the right to life.\u201d \n \n The Justice Ministry on Tuesday issued a statement in reaction to the criticism, underlining that the defendants have a right to appeal the verdicts to the Court of Cassation, which can order a retrial. If the retrial reaches a similar verdict, the defendants can appeal to the higher court again, it said. \n \n The two trials in Minya are connected to a wave of rioting and mob attacks on police stations by Morsi supporters in August, sparked when security forces stormed two pro-Morsi protest camps in Cairo, killing more than 600 people. \n \n In the latest trial, the defendants are charged with murder over the death of two policemen in an attack on a police station in the town of el-Adawa. They are also charged with attempted murder of five people \u2013 including a Christian resident \u2013 as well as with membership in a terrorist group and with aiding, financing and providing weapons to carry out a terrorist attack. \n \n The government has branded the Brotherhood a terrorist group, a claim it denies. \n \n As a show of protest over the verdicts in the first trial, defence lawyers boycotted Tuesday\u2019s tribunal. \n \n \u201cAs lawyers, we haven\u2019t seen anything like what happened here yesterday in our entire professional lives and we will not see anything like it until our deaths,\u201d Khaled Fouda, of the Minya lawyers\u2019 syndicate, told a press conference announcing the boycott. \n \n One of the boycotting defence lawyers, Yasser Zidan, said the judge violated the law by not postponing Tuesday\u2019s session until new lawyers could be appointed for the defendants. \u201cThis is just another disaster,\u201d Zidan said. \u201cThis judge smashed the rock of justice with his own hands. He is inventing a new law.\u201d \n \n According to the judicial and security officials, the judge questioned nearly 20 witnesses, including policemen and civilians who saw the police station attack. A collection of 70 video clips and 200 photos from the attack were also submitted into evidence. \n \n A few kilometres away from the court, clashes erupted between security forces firing tear gas and rubber bullets and Islamist students at Minya University who chanted slogans against the verdicts and the military. \n \n Roads around the Minya court building were blocked by cement blocks and metal barricades, manned by security forces and masked special forces. Armored vehicles patrolled the streets and shops in the vicinity of the court were shut down. \n \n Security forces kept small groups of protesters, including relatives of the defendants, and traffic away from the area. \n \n In a nearby coffee shop, relatives of the defendants sat to sip tea and have breakfast. One of them, 45-year-old al-Hawari, a farmer who spoke on condition he be identified only by his first name for fear of police harassment, said his cousins and neighbours are among the defendants. He insisted they were not involved in killings or violence. \n \n \u201cThese are all fabrications. Where is the evidence?\u201d said al-Hawari, dressed in traditional robes. Still, he acknowledged that on the day of the mob attack in the el-Adwa police station, many people were involved in fighting, shooting and rioting near the police station to take revenge from \u201cinjustice inflicted by the police officers.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe already know the verdict. God be with us,\u201d he said with a sigh. \n \n Maggie Michael reported from Cairo.",

As a Princeton undergraduate, he watched the movie repeatedly with his friends on the debate team and memorized a good chunk of the lines. \n \n In the last few weeks, Mr. Cruz, who dabbled, at times disastrously, in acting at Harvard Law School, has started reciting the lines on the campaign trail, including at an Iowa Central Community College event, where he performed a version of Mr. Patinkin\u2019s catchphrase in the movie: \u201cAllo, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\u201d \n \n As Mr. Patinkin\u2019s inbox became cluttered with videos of Mr. Cruz acting out scenes that he, Carol Kane and Billy Crystal had made famous (\u201cHe\u2019s doing all of Billy\u2019s lines!\u201d Mr. Patinkin said), the actor began wondering how much of the movie Mr. Cruz really understood. \n \n \u201cI would like to be with Senator Cruz for a moment and I would like to respectfully ask him, since he quotes all the lines from \u2018The Princess Bride\u2019 and certainly all of my character, Inigo Montoya\u2019s, lines, I would like to know why he doesn\u2019t quote my favorite line?\u201d That line, Mr. Patinkin said, was among the last his character utters in a movie that essentially taught that love conquers all. \n \n But first, some plot for the uninitiated: While working in the service of Vizzini, a comically arrogant criminal mastermind played by Wallace Shawn, Inigo is bested by the movie\u2019s hero, the mysterious Man in Black. \n \n Soon after, Inigo and his fellow hired hand, played by Andre the Giant, join the Man in Black in his noble mission to rescue his true love, played by the \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d star Robin Wright, who has been forcibly engaged to the evil prince Humperdinck, who plans to strangle her on their wedding night. But Inigo\u2019s true motive is to avenge the death of his father, slain decades earlier, by Humperdinck\u2019s sadistic six-fingered lieutenant. He does so in the climactic rescue scene at the end of the movie, in which he magically overcomes mortal wounds to win a duel to the death. \n \n \u201cAfter the princess flies out the window and falls into Andre the Giant\u2019s arms,\u201d Mr. Patinkin said, \u201cInigo says to the Man in Black, \u2018I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it\u2019s over, I don\u2019t know what to do with the rest of my life.\u2019\u201d \n \n Mr. Cruz, in Mr. Patinkin\u2019s heavily left-leaning worldview, is trafficking in the revenge business, appealing to anxious voters by saying of the Islamic State, \u201cWe will carpet-bomb them into oblivion,\u201d and by exploiting fears about immigrants and Muslims. \n \n \u201cSenator Cruz, if you\u2019re going to say those lines, you\u2019ve got to say the other line, too,\u201d Mr. Patinkin said. \n \n Sounding increasingly vexed, he added: \u201cThis man is not putting forth ideas that are at the heart of what that movie is all about. I would love for Senator Cruz, and everyone creating fear mongering and hatred, to consider creating hope, optimism and love. Open your arms to these people, these refugees trying to get into our country, and open your hearts.\u201d \n \n Catherine Frazier, a spokeswoman for the Cruz campaign, said in an email that the senator was \u201ca huge fan of the film and the actors in it.\u201d \n \n \u201cHaving some fun with a cult classic like \u2018The Princess Bride\u2019 should be something we can all get behind, politics aside,\u201d she said. ||||| View photo . Ted Cruz is a man of diverse tastes (Yahoo News/original image AP) \n \n Love him or hate him, it\u2019s safe to say Ted Cruz is currently the most compelling figure in U.S. politics today. \n \n \n \n The first-term Texas senator led the Republican charge against Obamacare that resulted in a 16-day government shutdown and ignited the passions of millions. And if political insiders are to be believed, Cruz is already gearing up to run for president in 2016. \n \n But for someone who has wielded so much influence in such little time, most people know very little about Cruz as a person. \n \n A few publications are aiming to change that. On Thursday, Cruz sat down with the Des Moines Register for a Q&A; and revealed a few facts about himself: \n \n His dream job: \u201cI\u2019d love to be the starting point guard for the Houston Rockets, and I\u2019m confident that there is no universe in which that will ever come to pass.\u201d \n \n Favorite movie: A self-described \u201chuge movie buff,\u201d Cruz says his favorite movie is 1987\u2019s \u201cThe Princess Bride.\u201d And that revelation led to a series of very obvious Internet references to the film. Fondness for this film is a true barometer of humanity and should provide a ray of sunshine into the hearts of even Cruz\u2019s most steadfast opponents. \n \n Least favorite food: As much as Cruz loves movies, he hates avocados. \u201cI despise avocado. It\u2019s the only food I dislike, and I dislike it passionately,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich is ironic, because I\u2019m Cuban and my dad grew up with avocado trees in his backyard. My whole family eats avocados like crazy, but I can\u2019t stand them.\u201d \n \n Of course, Cruz should be careful to not re-create George H.W. Bush\u2019s broccoli moment, as Texas is quickly becoming one of the larger avocado-growing states in the U.S. His comments already invoked the playful wrath of the Dallas Observer\u2019s Liz Goulding, who wrote, \u201cHow can you understand Texas if you don't enjoy chips and guacamole on a sunny patio every once and awhile (sic), or if you've never discovered that perfect mix of avocado, lime juice, and salt at home?\u201d \n \n When he was a Houston lawyer first running for the Senate in 2012, Cruz gave an interview to the Dallas Morning News in which he revealed some other personal facts. \n \n Worst school subject: French. \n \n Favorite food: While he despises avocados, Cruz says he loves beef enchiladas and Guinness stout. \n \n Skills: As to any \u201chidden talent,\u201d Cruz said, \u201cI love games of any sort: cards, chess, backgammon.\u201d He especially likes playing them on his iPhone, despite not having an unlimited data plan. \n \n Family background: While many have pointed out that the Texas senator was actually born in Canada, very few know that he is of Cuban descent. \"I do enjoy an occasional cigar. (I am Cuban after all),\u201d he told the paper. \n \n Education: Cruz graduated cum laude from Princeton, magna cum laude from Harvard Law School and clerked for former Chief Justice William Rehnquist. But, really, at the end of the day Cruz just wants to see Princess Buttercup returned safely home and maybe sneak in a game or two on his iPhone before bed. \n \n \n \n So, there\u2019s your basic primer on the man Slate\u2019s John Dickerson calls a \u201cpopulist egghead.\u201d ||||| Rather than explain why he loves the movie The Princess Bride, Ted Cruz decided to just demonstrate. The Texas senator and Republican presidential candidate went ahead and acted out an entire scene from the 1987 comedy classic \u2014 complete with imitations of the characters' voices \u2014 while taping a \"Candidate Cafe\" segment for WMUR. \n \n While most of the people at the table are cracking up laughing, some, like the guy sitting to Cruz's left, don't seem to know what to think of the whole thing. \"My media team is now having a heart attack,\" Cruz quips after wrapping up his rendition.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 To Mandy Patinkin, it's inconceivable that Ted Cruz has been uttering lines from The Princess Bride along the campaign trail\u2014and the actor, who played Inigo Montoya in the 1987 cult film, has had enough. \"How can I stop this?\" was Patinkin's reaction when friends started emailing him about images online that featured Cruz's face Photoshopped onto his character's body, he tells the New York Times. Cruz has long said the movie is his favorite, and he's committed a good portion of it to memory (including Patinkin's famous line: \"Allo, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die\"). But Patinkin isn't sure Cruz understands the film's subtext: namely that, despite the film focusing partly on his character's mission for vengeance, the real meaning revolves around the movie's hero rescuing his true love. \"[Cruz] is not putting forth ideas that are at the heart of what that movie is all about,\" Patinkin tells the Times in a tone the paper describes as \"increasingly vexed.\" Patinkin cites one of his character's final lines in the movie as one that should stand out more to Cruz: \"I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.\" The 63-year-old actor's beef with Cruz is that he's too focused on that revenge, preying on voter anxiety by, as the Times puts it, \"exploiting fears about immigrants and Muslims.\" Says Patinkin, \"Open your arms to these people, these refugees trying to get into our country, and open your hearts.\" A spokeswoman for Cruz's campaign told the Times in an email that \"having some fun with a cult classic \u2026 should be something we can all get behind, politics aside.\" In other words, no \"as you wish\" from Cruz.

A jury of six women convicted the rapper after a day of testimony, finding him guilty of battery after he was seen kicking a female fan during a concert in Lakeland in a video that went viral. The trial lasted one day. \n \n The judge sentenced Gates to 180 days in the Polk County Jail, with credit for any time served, and fines and court costs. \n \n In a previous hearing Gates attempted to have the charges dropped using the Stand Your Ground defense. He admitted he kicked a female fan after she reached out and grabbed his pants several times at Rumor\u2019s Nite Club in Lakeland.Lakeland Police charged Gates with simple battery in September 2015. \n \n In a previous court hearing Gates testified, \u201cI kicked them, I wanted them off me,\u201d he said, adding that after the girl grabbed him so many times, he kicked her in self-defense. \n \n During the trial Joe Hailey, head of security at Rumors Nightclub, testified. He said there were around 20 security guards working the night of the concert. He said the rapper\u2019s security team inspected the club before the concert and did not make any special requests for additional security, or a barricade between the stage and the crowd.

Prior to this week\u2019s verdict, Gates insisted he was innocent and was simply defending himself under Florida's infamous \"Stand Your Ground\" law. He claimed the victim, Miranda Dixon, was trying to pull him off stage by repeatedly grabbing his shorts from the crowd.

The sentence was three times what prosecutors requested. \n \n Cell phone video captured the moment Gates kicked the woman - which happened August 29, 2015 at Rumors nightclub. He was charged with an found guilty of battery for kicking the victim, 19-year-old Miranda Dixon. She testified in court Wednesday. \n \n \"He lifted his foot up and kicked me,\" said Dixon. \n \n Jurors also heard Gates's testimony in his own defense Wednesday. Gates was represented by Jose Baez, who famously defended Casey Anthony after her young daughter's death. \n \n Baez argued Gates was battered by Dixon before he kicked her. \n \n Dixon testified she reached out and touched Gates' shorts on two occasions. After the second time, Dixon says Gates kicked her so hard that she fell back and later blacked out. She also complained of pain in her upper stomach for a month after the incident. \n \n Baez argued Gates' foot didn't make contact with Dixon at all, and that Dixon was lying in order to gain damages in a separate civil suit against Gates. \n \n \"Her credibility is to be questioned and you will not be able to beyond and to the exclusion of every reasonable doubt in this case believe her and that is why you should enter a verdict of not guilty in this case,\" said Baez. \n \n The jury was made up of six white women, who decided to convict Gates after two hours of deliberation, which included re-watching the video of Gates kicking Dixon, but being denied by the judge testimony records regarding whether Gates testified that he did kick Dixon. The judge told the jurors they would have to rely on their memories.",

It\u2019s an early step in developing a lotion or cream that might provide fair-skinned folk with protection against skin cancer. \n \n As reported June 13 in Cell Reports, a topical drug penetrated and tanned laboratory samples of live human skin, absent the sun. Unlike self-tanning lotions that essentially stain skin brown and provide minimal sun protection, the drug activates the production of the dark form of the skin pigment melanin, which absorbs UV radiation and diminishes damage to skin cells. \n \n The team behind this study had worked with a different drug, the plant extract forskolin, in a 2006 study. The researchers used mice with skin like that of red-haired, fair-skinned people, who don\u2019t tan because of a nonfunctioning protein on the surface of the skin cells that make melanin. ||||| Image copyright Getty Images \n \n Scientists have developed a drug that mimics sunlight to make the skin tan, with no damaging UV radiation involved. \n \n The drug tricks the skin into producing the brown form of the pigment melanin in tests on skin samples and mice. \n \n Evidence suggests it will work even on redheads, who normally just burn in the sun. \n \n The team at Massachusetts General Hospital hope their discovery could prevent skin cancer and even slow the appearance of ageing. \n \n Potent tan \n \n UV light makes the skin tan by causing damage. \n \n This kicks off a chain of chemical reactions in the skin that ultimately leads to dark melanin - the body's natural sunblock - being made. \n \n The drug is rubbed into the skin to skip the damage and kick-start the process of making melanin. \n \n Dr David Fisher, one of the researchers, told the BBC News website: \"It has a potent darkening effect. \n \n \"Under the microscope it's the real melanin, it really is activating the production of pigment in a UV-independent fashion.\" \n \n Image copyright Nisma Mujahid and David Fisher Image caption The drug was tested on the skin sample on the right. \n \n It is a markedly different approach to fake tan, which \"paints\" the skin without the protection from melanin, sun beds, which expose the skin to UV light or pills that claim to boost melanin production but still need UV light. \n \n But the team is not motivated by making a new cosmetic. \n \n Dr Fisher said the lack of progress in skin cancer - the most common type of cancer - was a \"very significant frustration\". \n \n He added: \"Our real goal is a novel strategy for protecting skin from UV radiation and cancer. \n \n \"Dark pigment is associated with a lower risk of all forms of skin cancer - that would be really huge.\" \n \n Tests, detailed in the journal Cell Reports, have shown the melanin produced by the drug was able to block harmful UV rays. \n \n Eventually the scientists want to combine their drug with sun-cream to give maximum protection from solar radiation. \n \n Dr Fisher said everyone should \"absolutely\" use sun-cream but its weakness was it \"keeps you pale\". \n \n Image copyright Getty Images \n \n The way the drug works could also allow a ginger tan, as the genetic mutation that causes red hair and fair skin disrupts the normal process where UV light leads to dark melanin. \n \n It is not yet clear if the drug might have the unintended consequence of affecting the glorious hair colour, but it is thought the hair follicle is too deep in the skin for the drug to reach. \n \n But whether you are ginger, blonde or brunette, the drug is not yet ready for commercial use. \n \n The researchers want to do more safety testing, although so far there has been \"no hint of problems\". \n \n They will probably want to give it a better name than an SIK-inhibitor too. \n \n Matthew Gass, from the British Association of Dermatologists, said the study was a \"novel approach\" to preventing skin cancer. \n \n He added: \"A lot more research has to be done before we see this sort of technology being used on humans, however, it's certainly an interesting proposition. \n \n \"Skin cancer rates in the UK are going through the roof... any research into ways that we can prevent people from developing skin cancer in the first place is to be welcomed.\" \n \n Stopping UV damage could have an extra boon beyond cancer - slowing the appearance of ageing. \n \n Dr Fisher's final piece of promise for the research is: \"Many people would say the obvious and most dramatic sign of ageing is what skin looks like and even casual UV damage over the years causes damage. \n \n \"Medically it is very difficult to focus on, but if it is tremendously safe then it could keep skin healthier for longer.\" \n \n Follow James on Twitter. ||||| S \n \n cientists hoping to harness melanin\u2019s protective power against skin cancer have created a class of small molecules that could help the skin produce more UV-absorbing pigments.

The shooting occurs near the 7:40 mark. \n \n Police said Monday night they had concluded their on-scene investigation and the only item found near Clark's body was a cellphone. \n \n Police said two items that could be the \"tool bar\" that deputies in the helicopter saw were recovered from near the broken sliding glass door in the neighbor's yard: a cinder block and a piece of aluminum similar to what might be used for a gutter. \n \n On Monday, police said Clark used the tool bar to shatter a sliding glass door one house away from where he was shot. Police also said in a release that they believe Clark broke the windows of at least three nearby vehicles. \n \n At 9:18 p.m. Sunday night, officers responded to a call that a thin, 6-foot-1 black man wearing a black hooded sweatshirt and dark pants was hiding in a residential backyard after breaking car windows, according to a department media release. \n \n Sacramento County Sheriff's deputies circling the area in a helicopter spotted a man in a nearby backyard at about 9:25 p.m. and told police on the ground that he had just shattered a window with a tool bar then run to the front of that house and looked inside a car. The deputies in the helicopter began directing the officers on the ground to his location. \n \n Officers entered the front yard of Clark's residence in the 7500 block of 29th Street and spotted him along the side of the house. Department spokesman Vance Chandler said the man tracked by the helicopter was the same person confronted by officers, who said they ordered him to stop and show his hands. That man was later identified as Clark. \n \n Police said Clark instead fled from the officers toward the back of the property, where police said he turned and advanced toward the officers with an object in his hands. \n \n \"Fearing for their safety,\" the officers fired multiple rounds at Clark at 9:26 p.m., hitting him several times, the department said. \n \n The two officers involved in the shooting then held their position for about five minutes until additional officers arrived before approaching the victim. Clark was pronounced dead at the scene. \n \n Sequita Thompson, Clark's grandmother, said she was awake and sitting in the home's dining room when she heard four gunshots. \n \n \n \n \n \n \u201cThe only thing that I heard was pow, pow, pow, pow, and I got to the ground,\" she said. \n \n Thompson said neither she nor her husband heard police issuing commands prior to the shots being fired. \n \n Thompson dropped to the floor and crawled to the spot where her 7-year-old granddaughter slept on the a couch in an adjacent den, telling her to get on the ground as well, she said. \n \n Thompson then made her way to her husband, who uses a wheelchair to move around. \n \n Thompson said it was normal for Clark and others to enter the home through the backyard because the front doorbell doesn't work and she and her husband, who is in a wheelchair, have poor mobility. People would knock on the back window and ask her to use an automatic opener to raise the garage door to admit them, she said. \n \n Thompson said her husband called 911 to report the shots. \n \n Police interviewed Thompson for several hours about what she had heard but did not tell her about Clark, she said. She eventually decided to look out a window and saw her grandson's body in her backyard, she said. \n \n \u201cI opened that curtain and he was dead,\" she said. \"I started screaming.\u201d \n \n Both officers involved with the shooting were placed on paid administrative leave. One has been an SPD officer for four years, the other for two. Each had four years experience with other law enforcement agencies before joining SPD. \n \n \n \n \n \n Body-camera footage of the shooting will be released within 30 days, per a city policy approved in November 2016. \n \n Chandler said that video would include footage shot by Sacramento County Sheriff's deputies in the helicopter. The Sheriff's Department does not usually release video, but Chandler said the departments wanted to work \"collaboratively.\" \n \n The Sacramento County District Attorney\u2019s Office, city attorney\u2019s office and the city Office of Public Safety Accountability will investigate the shooting, as will SPD homicide detectives, internal affairs and Crime Scene Investigation units, he said. \n \n Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg said he supported the investigation and Sacramento Police Chief Daniel Hahn's \"intent to expediate the release of all relevant video.\" \n \n \"I am always sorry when someone loses their young life,\" Steinberg said. \"I am also grateful that the officers were unharmed.\" \n \n A Sacramento High School alumnus with a fondness for sneakers, football and video games, Clark left behind two young sons, Cairo and Aiden, his family said. \n \n Though his birth certificate read \"Stephen,\" Clark altered the spelling of his name to differentiate it from that of his father, Stevante said. \n \n Many friends also referred to him as \"Zoe,\" short for Alonzo, his middle name. \n \n Monday night, about 120 community activists led by Black Lives Matter gathered in front of the Meadowview Light Rail Station off of Meadowview Road for a vigil and protest.

According to the Sacramento Bee, police in Sacramento were responding Sunday night to reports of a man breaking car windows when they found Clark in his backyard. Police say the 22-year-old man at first fled before approaching officers while holding an \"object\" that he \"extended in front of him.\" Police say the officers thought it was a gun and, fearing for their safety, opened fire on Clark. Police initially said the object turned out to be a \"tool bar\" of some kind only to later revise that: Clark was apparently holding only a cellphone. No gun was found at the scene. \u201cI know there could have been another way. He didn\u2019t have to die,\u201d Clark's older brother tells CBS. \"He didn't deserve it.\" Clark's grandmother, who lives at the home, says neither she nor her husband heard officers give Clark any orders before opening fire. Police say Clark used an object, possibly a cinder block or piece of aluminum, to break a neighbor's glass door and the windows of at least three cars in the area before he was killed. Police say they will release body camera and helicopter footage of the shooting within a week. Salena Manni, Clark's girlfriend of five years and mother of his two young children, tells KXTV he wouldn't have threatened officers. \"He had too much to lose,\" she says. \"He would never want to leave his kids.\"",

    "document": "High winds, frigid temperatures and a lot of snow hit the East Coast overnight, and cities are scrambling to manage the impact. NBC's Ron Mott reports from Boston. \n \n A massive winter storm dumped 20 inches of snow on parts of New England and looked set to cripple much of the Midwest and Northeast on Friday as millions faced dangerously cold temperatures. \n \n Sub-zero wind chills arrived with the storm, and the biting wind and blowing snow have shut down interstates and airports alike. \n \n John F. Kennedy Airport in New York was officially closed at 6:12 a.m. Friday and is not expected to re-open until 8:30 a.m., and Boston's Logan International is effectively shutdown, as well. \n \n Interstate 84 in New York and the Long Island Expressway, closed at midnight as the storm roared in, remained so until 8 a.m. \n \n Snowfall reports varied widely, with New York City receiving 7 inches, Baltimore some 3 to 6 inches, Philadelphia roughly 5 inches, Hartford 6 to 10 inches and Boston as much as 14 inches. \n \n Some 20 inches have already fallen on other parts of Massachusetts, according to The Weather Channel lead meteorologist Michael Palmer. Boxford, Mass., northwest of Boston, reported 21 inches. \n \n Schools across the Northeast, including all public schools in New York City, are closed Friday. \n \n Winter weather and wind-chill advisories were in effect in at least 22 states, stretching from Chicago through the New York tri-state region into New England and affecting an area home to more than 100 million people. \n \n NBC's Tom Costello provides a winter travel update, and reports that hundreds of flights have been canceled after a winter storm struck the East Coast. \n \n The cold behind the snowstorm could be deadly, with parts of the Midwest expecting lows not seen since the mid-1980s, according to Palmer. \n \n \"It's going to be brutal,\" Weather Channel coordinating meteorologist Tom Moore said. \"People that are vulnerable are really going to be hurting.\" \n \n The high temperature in New York City will be in the teens on Friday during the day and drop to between 5 and 8 degrees in the evening, with the wind chill making it feel well below zero. \n \n \"This is nothing to be trifled with,\" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. \"We have learned too well over the past few years the power of Mother Nature. We have seen the damage that has been done.\" \n \n Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick dismissed all state workers at 3 p.m. on Thursday, and urged residents to minimize time outside and be aware of frostbite and hypothermia symptoms. \"That is a very, very dangerous set of circumstances,\" he said. \n \n Temperatures from upstate New York to Maine were below zero, and wind chills \u2014 the \"feels like\" effect \u2014 were minus-30 in some spots. \n \n Across the Northeast, residents were fretting about the blast of bitter cold. \n \n \u201cI think I\u2019m more concerned about the terrible cold Friday night rather than the storm itself,\" David Ball of Scituate, Mass., which was facing coastal flooding, told NBC affiliate WHDH. \"Hopefully the power stays on.\" \n \n The weather was affecting air travel, with some 1,600 flights being cancelled Friday on top of about 2,000 on Thursday, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. \n \n Thirty planes sat on the tarmac at Chicago\u2019s Midway International Airport on Thursday night, with hundreds of passengers forced to wait while the runways were cleared for takeoff, reported NBC Chicago. Some travelers said they sat inside idled planes for up to four hours. \n \n NBC's Kristen Dahlgren reports from Long Island, NY, where a blizzard warning is still in effect and many public buildings have shut down. \n \n \u201cWe arrived at 10 p.m. and its [sic] getting cold on the plane,\u201d passenger Efraid Mata wrote in an email to NBC Chicago. \n \n The delays and cancellations in the Midwest and Northeast created a logjam in the rest of the country\u2019s flight schedules. Even in warm and sunny Southern California, dozens of flights at LAX in Los Angeles were put on hold or scrapped Thursday, with the same expected Friday. \n \n The first brutal blast of cold shattered records in Minnesota on Thursday \u2014 and a second blast is expected to barrel from the Great Plains and Midwest on Sunday and Monday and into the East on Tuesday. \n \n The second wave of icy weather will stretch from the upper Midwest to Kentucky and Tennessee, forecasters said. \n \n Chicago will struggle to get above minus 8 and by Monday morning the wind will make it feel like it's 40 below zero there. \n \n In Green Bay, Wis., where the Packers host an NFL playoff game Sunday evening, the low temperature could reach minus 18. \n \n \"Even Atlanta's northern suburbs could be in single digits by Monday night,\" Moore said. \n \n Larry Wittmers, a hypothermia expert at the University of Minnesota-Duluth medical school, said it's not necessarily the coldest areas that face the most peril. \n \n \"True hypothermia cases turn up more often in more southern regions because people are not prepared and don't know what to do,\" Wittmers said. \n \n How long people can safely spend outside depends on how wet or windy it is and how they are dressed, Wittmer said. Shoveling snow or other exercise can be dangerous because sweat reduces the insulation capability of clothing, and consuming alcohol can speed heat loss and reduce awareness of the cold. \n \n And even though record snowfall is not expected, the cold could make roads even more hazardous because the snow-melting salt that homeowners and road crews use loses effectiveness at between 10 and 20 degrees. \n \n To give plows time to work and guard against vehicles getting stranded, New York's Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency and closed several major roads. New Jersey also declared a state of emergency. \n \n \"As this winter storm unfolds, bringing heavy snow and high winds to many parts of the state, I strongly urge all New Yorkers to exercise caution, avoid travel and stay indoors,\" Cuomo said. \n \n At the Pine Street Inn shelter in Boston, vice president Heidi Daniels was preparing for a packed house. \n \n \"We won't turn anybody away,\" she said. \"We'll pull out cots and mats and make sure everybody has a warm place to stay tonight.\" \n \n NBC News' Tracy Connor, Daniel Arkin and Ron Mott contributed to this story. \n \n Related: \n \n This story was originally published on ||||| By Dr. Jeff MastersJanuary 1, 2016 \n \n Nine Category 5 storms whipped into life over the world's oceans in 2015: five in the Northwest Pacific, one in the Northeast Pacific, one in the Southeast Pacific, and two in the South Indian Ocean.

Ahmed was arrested because school officials called the police after he showed one of his teachers his homemade clock.

However, this effect is not included in the IPCC report issued Friday morning, which means the estimates of how Earth's climate will change are likely on the conservative side. ||||| BOSTON (AP) \u2014 A blustering winter storm that dropped nearly 2 feet of snow just north of Boston, shut down major highways in New York and Pennsylvania and forced U.S. airlines to cancel thousands of flights nationwide menaced the Northeast on Friday with howling winds and frigid temperatures. \n \n Snow accumulates on an NYPD officer in Times Square, Thursday, Jan. 2, 2014, in New York.

Up to 7 inches fell in New York City by Friday morning. \n \n The snowfall, frigid cold and stiff winds extended the holiday break for some students for a second day while posing the first test for New York City's new mayor and perhaps the last challenge for Boston's outgoing one. \n \n U.S. airlines canceled more than 2,300 flights because of the snowfall and low visibility. \n \n \"It's been a tough road,\" traveler Heather Krochuk, of Toronto, Canada, said inside a Boston hotel Thursday night after her flight home out of Logan International Airport got canceled in what's turned into a 36-hour trip from Seattle, where she spent Christmas with her husband, Ron. \n \n But, she said, \"we have a place to sleep that isn't the airport.\" \n \n Snow began falling overnight Wednesday in parts of New England and New York state, but the brunt of the storm began late Thursday. The National Weather Service issued a blizzard warning for Cape Cod, coastal areas north and south of Boston and part of Maine as well as New York's Long Island. \n \n Forecasters warned that gusts of up to 30 miles per hour could bring wind chills to minus 25 degrees, cold enough to cause frostbite in about 30 minutes or less. The weather service said people should dress warmly to avoid hypothermia and cover all exposed skin. \n \n Governors in New York and New Jersey declared states of emergency, urging residents to stay home. Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said state offices that closed early Thursday would remain closed Friday. He said National Guard members and state police were on standby for any high tide flooding in vulnerable coastal areas, but no mandatory evacuations had been ordered. \n \n New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered three major highways in his state, stretching from Long Island to Albany, closed overnight. The Thruway between Albany and the Bronx reopened for passenger vehicles at 5 a.m. Friday and was scheduled to reopen to commercial vehicles at 8 a.m. The Long Island Expressway and Interstate 84 between the Pennsylvania and Connecticut borders were scheduled to reopen at 8 a.m. Southbound Interstate 95 closed in Philadelphia because of a jackknifed tractor-trailer. \n \n As of late Thursday in Connecticut, about 3 inches of snow had fallen in Hartford County, and 3 inches were reported in East Hartford and Simsbury. Parts of New Hampshire had 5.5 inches, and areas of Rhode Island had more than 2. \n \n Outreach teams looked to get homeless people off the frigid streets of New York City and Boston. \n \n Staff members at the Pine Street Inn were keeping the Boston shelter open 24 hours and said they would turn no one away, even if it meant setting up extra cots in lobbies and other common areas. \n \n The heavy weather began rolling in just a day after New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was sworn in to lead the nation's largest city and a few days before Boston Mayor Thomas Menino ends 20 years in office on Monday. \n \n De Blasio, who as public advocate in 2010 criticized his predecessor Mayor Michael Bloomberg for his handling of a large snowstorm, dispatched hundreds of plows and salt spreaders on the streets as soon as the snow started falling Thursday night. Forecasters said that while only 5 inches of snow had fallen in Central Park by early Friday, up to 8 inches were still expected in the city. \n \n \"If you don't need to go out, please don't go out,\" de Blasio said at a news conference Thursday evening, urging residents to use mass transit. \"Stay off the streets, stay out of your cars.\" \n \n Across the region, state and local police were busy responding to accidents and reports of stranded vehicles. \n \n Amtrak planned to run trains on all of its Northeast lines on Friday but operate on a modified schedule, spokeswoman Christina Leeds said. Metro-North Railroad, which runs trains between New York City and suburban Connecticut, Long Island and New York's Hudson Valley, was operating on a Saturday schedule, meaning about 60 percent of its typical weekday trains were running. \n \n As the storm approached, a worker at a suburban Philadelphia salt storage facility was killed when a 100-foot-tall pile of road salt fell and crushed him. Falls Township police said the man was trapped while operating a backhoe. There was no word on what may have caused the accident. \n \n Douglass Bibule shopped for rock salt and other supplies at a home improvement store in Watertown, N.Y. \n \n \"Well, there will be some shoveling that I will have to do and some sanding,\" he said. \"I've got to go home and do some stretching exercises to make sure I don't hurt myself while doing that, and do a little shopping to make sure that we have all the supplies that we need. We need food because we have three older children at home.\" \n \n The snowstorm worked its way east from the Midwest, where it dropped up to a foot of snow on Michigan and more than a foot in parts of Illinois, prompting the cancellation Thursday of hundreds of flights at both Chicago airports. \n \n Nearly 17 inches of snow fell in some of Chicago's northern suburbs, and more than 12 inches of snow was recorded at Midway International Airport. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers John Christoffersen in New Haven, Conn., Wilson Ring in Montpelier, Vt., Holly Ramer in Concord, N.H., Jim Fitzgerald and Jonathan Lemire in New York City, David Sharp in Portland, Maine, Bruce Shipkowski in Toms River, N.J., and Jackie Quinn in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report.",

(Associated Press) \n \n This April 26, 2002 file photo provided by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, shows Todd Ashker, a validated leader of the Aryan Brotherhood, who has been in the Security Housing... (Associated Press) \n \n No other state keeps so many inmates segregated for so long, according to the Center for Constitutional Rights. The New York City-based nonprofit center represents inmates in a class-action federal lawsuit settled on behalf of nearly 3,000 California inmates held in segregation statewide. \n \n The state is agreeing to segregate only inmates who commit new crimes behind bars and will no longer lock gang members in soundproofed, windowless cells solely to keep them from directing illegal activities by gang members. \n \n \"It will move California more into the mainstream of what other states are doing while still allowing us the ability to deal with people who are presenting problems within our system, but do so in a way where we rely less on the use of segregation,\" Corrections and Rehabilitation Secretary Jeffrey Beard told The Associated Press. \n \n The conditions triggered intermittent hunger strikes by tens of thousands of inmates throughout the prison system in recent years. Years-long segregation also drew criticism this summer from President Barack Obama and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. \n \n \"I think there is a deepening movement away from solitary confinement in the country and I think this settlement will be a spur to that movement,\" Jules Lobel, the inmates' lead attorney and president of the Center for Constitutional Rights, said in a telephone interview. \n \n The lawsuit was initially filed in 2009 by two killers serving time in the security housing unit at Pelican Bay. By 2012, Todd Ashker and Danny Troxell were among 78 prisoners confined in Pelican Bay's isolation unit for more than 20 years, though Troxell has since been moved to another prison. \n \n More than 500 had been in the unit for more than 10 years, though recent policy changes reduced that to 62 inmates isolated for a decade or longer as of late July. \n \n The suit contended that isolating inmates in 80-square-foot cells for all but about 90 minutes each day amounts to cruel and unusual punishment. \n \n About half the nearly 3,000 inmates held in such units are in solitary confinement. Inmates have no physical contact with visitors and are allowed only limited reading materials and communications with the outside world. \n \n The settlement will limit how long inmates can spend in isolation, while creating restrictive custody units for inmates who refuse to participate in rehabilitation programs or keep breaking prison rules. \n \n They will also house those who might be in danger if they live with other inmates. For instance, 71-year-old Hugo Pinell was killed by fellow inmates in August just days after he was released from isolation, decades after he became infamous for his role in a failed 1971 San Quentin State Prison escape attempt that killed six. \n \n Lobel said the new units, by giving high-security inmates more personal contact and privileges, should be an example to other states to move away from isolation policies that he said have proven counterproductive in California. \n \n Marie Levin, sister of 57-year-old reputed gang leader Ronnie Dewberry, read a statement from her brother, who goes by the name Sitawa Nantambu Jamaa, and other plaintiffs hailing the \"monumental victory for prisoners and an important step toward our goal of ending solitary confinement in California and across the country.\" \n \n With the pending policy changes, this will be the \"first time Marie will be able to hold her brother, touch her brother, for 31 years,\" Lobel said on a teleconference call with Levin and other advocates. \n \n Nichol Gomez, a spokeswoman for the union representing most prison guards, said it was disappointing that \"the people that actually have to do the work\" weren't involved in the negotiations, so she couldn't immediately comment. \n \n Beard said he will work to ease the unions' previously expressed concerns that guards could face additional danger. He said the settlement expands on recent changes that have reduced the number of segregated inmates statewide from 4,153 in January 2012 to 2,858 currently. \n \n Until recently, gang members could serve unlimited time in isolation. Under the settlement, they and other inmates can be segregated for up to five years for crimes committed in prison, though gang members can receive another two years in segregation. \n \n Beard said the segregation system was adopted about 35 years ago after a series of slayings of inmates and guards and wasn't reconsidered until recently because California corrections officials were consumed with other crises, including severe crowding. \n \n \"We probably had too many people locked up too long, because over 70 percent of the people that were reviewed were actually released, and we've had very, very few problems with those releases,\" Beard said.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Thousands of inmates will soon be moved out of solitary confinement in California, after years of court battles and hunger strikes against the controversial practice. The state's decision was revealed in a legal settlement filed today\u2014which still must be accepted by the court\u2014with a group of inmates who have been isolated at Pelican Bay State Prison for 10 years or more, the Los Angeles Times reports. The settlement applies to a class-action federal lawsuit covering almost 3,000 inmates, a lawsuit originally filed in 2009 by Todd Ashker and Danny Troxell, two murderers serving sentences in Pelican Bay. California has agreed to stop using solitary confinement as a means of controlling prison gangs; instead, the most dangerous prisoners will be held in a group setting and will have many of the same privileges as other inmates. As the AP notes, California's previously unlimited isolation of gang leaders had been used to keep hundreds of prisoners segregated (often in soundproofed, windowless cells of just 80 square feet, for all but an hour and a half per day, with no access to visitors, communication, or even reading materials) for 10 years or more. Now, California will release many of the affected prisoners back into the general prison population and will limit the amount of time prisoners can spend in isolation. New \"restrictive custody units\" will be used for inmates who commit new crimes while in prison, refuse to participate in rehab, or who may be in danger from other inmates, but those units will allow prisoners more personal contact and other privileges. The union that represents most prison guards has expressed safety concerns, with the spokesperson noting that the state could \"return to the prison environment of the '70s and '80s, when inmate-on-inmate homicides were at the highest levels and staff were killed.\"",

    "document": "Image caption The escalating carnage in Syria has increased pressure for western intervention \n \n The US is to step up its support for the Syrian opposition as it fights to topple President Bashar al-Assad, Secretary of State John Kerry says. \n \n Mr Kerry said the US would provide direct support to rebel forces in the form of medical and food supplies. \n \n He also promised an additional $60m (\u00a340m) in aid to the opposition to help it deliver basic governance and other services in rebel-controlled areas. \n \n Mr Kerry was speaking at a gathering of the Friends of Syria group in Rome. \n \n On Friday he is travelling to Ankara to discuss the Syria crisis with top Turkish officials. \n \n 'Out of time' \n \n The promise of direct, non-lethal aid to the rebels represents a shift in US policy on Syria, correspondents say. \n \n Media caption John Kerry: \"This funding will allow the opposition... to be able to rebuild\" \n \n However it falls short of providing the weapons and munitions that the rebels say they need to defeat government forces. \n \n Mr Kerry said the decision was designed to increase the pressure on President Assad to step down and allow a democratic transition. \n \n \"The US decision to take further steps now is the result of the brutality of superior armed force propped up by foreign fighters from Iran and Hezbollah. \n \n \"President Assad is out of time and must be out of power,\" said Mr Kerry, adding that the Syrian leader could not \"shoot his way out\" of the situation. \n \n The $60m in aid to the opposition Syrian National Coalition (SNC) represents a doubling of US support. \n \n It was intended to help the opposition deliver governance and basic services in rebel-controlled areas, said Mr Kerry. \n \n \"As the regime continues to lose ground it will help the opposition extend stability and build representative government and the rule of law,\" he added. \n \n The signals are clear. Diplomatic patience is running out and the international calculus is slowly shifting. The debate on arming the Syrian opposition is not going to go away. Non-lethal military aid looks to be the next step for some governments. The problem is that the arming debate is no simple one. More weapons may even up the contest but equally could increase the bloodshed in the short term. How could weapons be kept out of the hands of extremist Islamist groups? And is it really true, as some have argued, that supplying weaponry will boost the influence of Western governments among groups that will have a key role in any post-Assad Syria? One reason the diplomatic clock has been moving so slowly is, in fairness, that while terrible events have been taking place on the ground, there are probably no easy diplomatic answers to be found. Frustration forces Western shift on Syria \n \n After the meeting, the European Union announced changes to its arms embargo on Syria, allowing EU states to provide armoured vehicles, non-lethal military equipment and technical aid to the rebels, but not weapons. \n \n At the meeting with Mr Kerry, leader of the SNC, Moaz al-Khatib, said he was still frustrated by the lack of military help for rebel fighters. \n \n He initially refused to attend the Rome talks in protest at a lack of international support for the Syrian rebels, but was persuaded after the US and UK indicated there would be specific promises of aid. \n \n Mosque 'captured' \n \n Speaking at the meeting Mr Khatib called on President Assad to make \"one wise decision in your life\" and stand down \"for the future of your country\". \n \n Earlier this month he also suggested for the first time that talks with the Assad government might be possible, though that suggestion remains controversial among opposition groups. \n \n The SNC says it plans to set up a government to administer rebel-held areas of Syria, primarily in the north of the country close to the Turkish border. \n \n But a meeting to select the prime minister, scheduled for the weekend, was unexpectedly postponed on Thursday, and no new date has been set. \n \n Meanwhile fighting in Syria continues and the humanitarian situation is worsening. \n \n In the latest fighting, rebel forces have captured the historic Umayyad Mosque in Aleppo, according to an activist group. \n \n The mosque was damaged and its museum caught fire as rebels forced government troops to withdraw, UK-based activist group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. \n \n Fighting also raged elsewhere in Aleppo's old city, including near the Palace of Justice, it added. \n \n 'New phase' \n \n Aleppo - Syria's second city - has been a key battleground in the conflict. \n \n Mr Kerry highlighted the fate of the city in his address, accusing President Assad of engaging in \"ruthless attacks\" with Scud missiles against rebel-held areas. \n \n According to UN estimates, more than 70,000 people have been killed in Syria since the revolt against President Assad began nearly two years ago. \n \n Opposition fighters have been constantly outgunned as President Assad's forces deploy tanks, aircraft and missiles against them. \n \n Image caption The Syrian rebels say weapons and ammunition are what they need most \n \n The UN's refugees agency says the number of Syrians who have fled the conflict into neighbouring countries is now approaching one million, while two million have been internally displaced. \n \n The World Health Organisation has warned of disease outbreaks and worsening medical services. \n \n Earlier, UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said the Friends of Syria were determined to \"ramp up\" assistance to the opposition. \n \n \"We are entering a new phase in the response of Western and Arab nations to the crisis in Syria,\" he said. \n \n The Friends of Syria organisation has broad international support, but does not include Syrian allies Russia and China. \n \n On Thursday Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks on Syria with his French counterpart Francois Hollande. \n \n He conceded that there were differences in the positions of Russia and France, but said both had agreed that Syria should not be allowed to break apart as a result of the conflict. ||||| ROME (Reuters) - Western powers pledged aid for Syrian rebels on Thursday but stopped short of offering them weapons, disappointing opponents of President Bashar al-Assad clamoring for more arms. \n \n More than 70,000 Syrians have been killed in a fierce conflict that began with peaceful anti-Assad protests nearly two years ago. \n \n Washington has given $385 million in humanitarian aid for Syria but U.S. President Barack Obama has so far refused to give arms, arguing it is difficult to prevent them from falling into the hands of militants who could use them on Western targets. \n \n The United States said it would for the first time give non-lethal aid to the rebels and would more than double its support to Syria\u2019s civilian opposition, casting it as a way to bolster the rebels\u2019 popular support. \n \n The help will include medical supplies, food for rebel fighters and $60 million to help the civil opposition provide basic services like security, education and sanitation. \n \n U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry announced the new steps after a meeting of 11 mostly European and Arab nations within the \u201cFriends of Syria\u201d group. \n \n The European Union, acting on a decision this month to send direct aid to the rebels, said it had amended sanctions on Syria to permit the supply of armored vehicles, non-lethal military equipment and technical aid, provided they were intended to protect civilians. \n \n If the provision of non-lethal assistance goes smoothly, it could conceivably offer a model for providing weaponry should Western governments ultimately decide to do so. \n \n The aid offered for now did not appear to entirely satisfy the Syrian National Council opposition, a fractious Cairo-based group that has struggled to gain traction inside Syria, especially among disparate rebel forces. \n \n \u201cMany sides ... focus (more) on the length of the rebel fighter\u2019s beard than they do on the blood of the children being killed,\u201d Syrian National Coalition President Moaz Alkhatib said at an appearance with Kerry and Italian Foreign Minister Giulio Terzi. \n \n A rebel commander in Aleppo, Syria\u2019s second city left devastated by several months of heavy fighting, said the lack of arms was the main obstacle to victory for his forces. \n \n \u201cWe hope ... that weapons will flow and things will change but we are not waiting for them - we are going ahead with our fighting plans on the ground,\u201d the commander, Abdel-Jabbar Oqaidi, told Reuters by Skype. \n \n He estimated that four fifths of the city was now under rebel control and the insurgents had taken over Aleppo\u2019s historic Umayyad mosque and the Palace of Justice. The claim could not immediately be verified. \n \n A picture posted on the Internet showed what activists said was a rebel fighter prostrate in prayer in the Umayyad mosque\u2019s courtyard, its blackened archways still bearing signs of a fire which damaged the 13th century complex last year. \n \n The rebels were still fighting for control of three airports in the Aleppo region, Oqaidi said. \n \n DISAPPOINTMENT \n \n In what analysts described as a sign of disappointment at the West\u2019s reluctance to send arms, Syria\u2019s political opposition postponed talks to choose the leader of a provisional government, two opposition sources told Reuters in Beirut. \n \n Opposition leaders hoped a Saturday meeting in Istanbul would elect a prime minister to operate in rebel-controlled areas of Syria, threatened by a slide into chaos as the conflict between Assad\u2019s forces and insurgents nears its second anniversary. \n \n While one source said the meeting might happen later in the week, a second source said it had been put off because the three most likely candidates for prime minister had reservations about taking the role without more concrete international support. \n \n \u201cThe opposition has been increasingly signaling that it is tired of waiting and no one serious will agree to be head of a government without real political and logistical support,\u201d said Syrian political commentator Hassan Bali, who lives in Germany. \n \n Bali said the United States and other members of the core \u201cFriends of Syria\u201d nations appeared intent \u201con raising the ante against Assad but are not sure how.\u201d \n \n A final communiqu\u00e9 said participants would \u201ccoordinate their efforts closely so as to best empower the Syrian people and support the Supreme Military Command of the (rebel) Free Syrian Army in its efforts to help them exercise self-defense\u201d. \n \n U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry (L) gestures next to Syrian National Coalition head Mouaz al-Khatib during a news conference at Villa Madama in Rome February 28, 2013. REUTERS/Remo Casilli \n \n Kerry said the United States would for the first time provide assistance - in the form of medical supplies and the standard U.S. military ration known as Meals Ready to Eat, or MREs - to the fighters. \n \n A U.S. official told reporters it would give the aid only to carefully vetted fighters, adding that the United States was worried that \u201cextremists\u201d opposed to democracy, human rights and tolerance were gaining ground in the country. \n \n \u201cThose members of the opposition who support our shared values ... need to set an example of a Syria where daily life is governed neither by the brutality of the Assad regime nor by the agenda of al Qaeda affiliated extremists,\u201d the official said. \n \n REBELS WANT ANTI-TANK, ANTI-AIRCRAFT WEAPONS \n \n The continued U.S. refusal to send weapons may compound the frustration that prompted the coalition to say last week it would shun the Rome talks. It attended only under U.S. pressure. \n \n Many in the coalition say Western reluctance to arm rebels only plays into the hands of Islamist militants now widely seen as the most effective forces in the struggle to topple Assad. \n \n With fighting raging on largely sectarian lines, French President Francois Hollande said at a Moscow summit that new partners were needed to broker talks on ending the crisis, winning guarded support from Russian President Vladimir Putin. \n \n \u201cWe think that this dialogue must find a new form so that it speaks to all parties,\u201d said Hollande, giving few details of his proposal. \n \n Putin said Russia - one of Assad\u2019s staunchest allies - would look at Hollande\u2019s proposal, \u201cwhich I think we could consider with all our partners and try to carry out.\u201d \n \n Russia has said Assad\u2019s departure must not be a precondition for talks and a political solution, while the West has sided with Syria\u2019s opposition in demanding his removal from power. \n \n Kerry\u2019s offer of medical aid and food rations fell far short of rebel demands for sophisticated anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons to help turn the tables against Assad\u2019s mostly Russian-supplied forces. \n \n It also stopped short of providing other forms of non-lethal assistance such as bullet-proof vests, armored personnel vehicles and military training to the insurgents. \n \n Slideshow (8 Images) \n \n Last week the European Union opened the way for direct aid to Syrian rebels, but did not lift an arms embargo on Syria. \n \n Kerry said the U.S. role should not be judged in isolation but in the context of what other nations will do. \n \n \u201cWhat we are doing ... is part of a whole,\u201d he said. \u201cI am absolutely confident ... that the totality of this effort is going to have an impact of the ability of the Syrian opposition to accomplish its goals.\u201d ||||| U.S. To Give Syrian Opposition $60 Million More In Non-Lethal Aid, Kerry Says \n \n The Obama administration will ask Congress for an additional $60 million in aid to help the Syrian opposition council provide basic goods and services in areas under rebel control, Secretary of State John Kerry announced Thursday in Rome. \n \n NPR's Michele Kelemen, who is among the correspondents traveling with Kerry on his first overseas trip since becoming secretary, tells our Newscast Desk that the U.S. \"is also offering non-lethal assistance to the free Syrian army \u2014 in the form of food rations and medical supplies.\" She adds that \"U.S. officials say that the Syrian opposition laid out many other needs in talks with Kerry and the Obama administration is 'keeping that under review.' \" \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Alberto Pizzoli/AFP/Getty Images Alberto Pizzoli/AFP/Getty Images \n \n The BBC starts its report on the news this way: \n \n \"The U.S. is to step up its support for the Syrian opposition as it fights to topple President Bashar al-Assad, Secretary of State John Kerry says. Mr. Kerry said the US would provide 'direct support' in the form of medical and food supplies to rebel forces.

As we reported Wednesday, they said the U.S. was also contemplating giving rebels \"equipment such as body armor and armored vehicles,\" though not weapons. \n \n Today, the Post writes that: ||||| The Obama administration will provide food and medicine to Syrian rebel fighters, Secretary of State John F. Kerry said Thursday, announcing a cautious U.S. foray into front-line battlefield support that falls far short of the heavy weapons or high-tech gear the rebels seek. \n \n \u201cThe stakes are really high, and we can\u2019t risk letting this country \u2014 in the heart of the Middle East \u2014 be destroyed by vicious autocrats or hijacked by the extremists,\u201d Kerry said following discussions among a group of Western and Arab nations that are funding, and in some cases arming, the fighters. \n \n The United States will, for the first time, send supplies through the rebels\u2019 central military headquarters, with U.S. advisers supervising the distribution of food rations and medical supplies, U.S. officials said. The shift is intended to give the U.S.-backed Syrian Opposition Coalition greater say over the aid, but it is also a test of the rebels\u2019 ability to keep donated supplies out of the hands of extremists in their midst. \n \n Washington also will send an additional $60 million to help the umbrella Syrian Opposition Coalition provide basic services such as sanitation and education in areas the rebels now control, Kerry said. That is on top of about $50 million spent on indirect help for the opposition. The goal of the new money is to counter the increasingly effective network of services provided by militants. \n \n Kerry called President Obama\u2019s decision to expand U.S. support \u201ca significant stepping-up of the policy.\u201d \n \n Britain and other nations working in concert with the United States are expected to go further to help the rebel Free Syrian Army by providing battlefield equipment such as armored vehicles, night-vision devices or body armor. The Obama administration is weighing similar assistance, but Kerry announced only the first, small steps. \n \n The United States is one of about a dozen nations prepared to provide broader financial and practical support for the rebels fighting to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Kerry and other diplomats framed the new help during meetings with Syrian political opposition leaders Thursday in Rome. \n \n Standing alongside Kerry in a joint appearance before reporters, the leader of the Syrian Opposition Coalition had no words of thanks for an offer that still represents a hedge of the U.S. bet on the group it helped to form last year. \n \n Coalition chairman Mouaz al-Khatib angrily appealed for a humanitarian corridor to the besieged city of Homs and said the rebels are tired of Western complaints about extremists in their ranks. He argued that the real enemy is the Assad regime but said too many outsiders are worried only about \u201cthe length of a beard of a fighter.\u201d \n \n \u201cNo terrorists in the world have such a savage nature as those in the regime,\u201d Khatib said in Arabic. \n \n The Syrian opposition leader\u2019s finger-jabbing anger was in marked contrast to Kerry\u2019s clipped and measured tone. Kerry looked at Khatib without expression as the Syrian spoke. \n \n Kerry said Assad is \u201cout of time and must be out of power.\u201d But U.S. officials acknowledged that Assad has shown little sign that he is ready to bargain with the rebels. \n \n The rebels have captured significant territory and large caches of military weapons, but the two-year war that has killed about 70,000 people remains mostly a stalemate. \n \n Kerry said he is confident that, combined with other nations\u2019 new offers, the U.S. assistance will make a difference. \n \n \u201cThe totality of this effort is going to have an impact on the ability of the Syrian opposition to accomplish its goals,\u201d Kerry said. He promised to take other rebel requests to Washington for further discussion. \n \n The Obama administration and its leading European allies, including Britain and France, have sought to coordinate their assistance to the rebels, and Kerry will now head to Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar to try to ensure that all countries providing aid are working from the same game plan. The Saudis have taken the lead in sending weapons to opposition fighters. \n \n Like the rebels themselves, Saudi Arabia would prefer that the United States move toward a military intervention. Although U.S. officials indicated additional aid would be forthcoming, the administration is still opposed to sending weapons or using its aircraft to stop Assad\u2019s air bombardments. Discussions are ongoing in Washington to determine how much further the administration is willing to go, including expansion of a minimal military training program. \n \n In a tweet following the Rome meeting, British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Britain will \u201cbe announcing new assistance.\u201d \n \n Britain and France have been awaiting an easing of a European Union arms embargo on Syria that will go into effect Friday. The new terms allow individual E.U. members to provide \u201cnon-lethal and technical assistance to protect Syrian civilians.\u201d Each member country is left to decide what form its aid will take. \n \n British and French officials have indicated that their support of the rebel forces might also include training, coordinated with allies and conducted outside Syria. \n \n Another opposition figure, Adib Shishakly, who is in charge of coordinating humanitarian assistance for the National Coalition for Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces, cautiously welcomed the U.S. announcement. \n \n \u201cWe expected more, but hopefully this is a positive start,\u201d he said, speaking from the coalition\u2019s headquarters in Cairo. However, he added, the opposition is \u201cabsolutely disappointed\u201d that the United States is not offering military assistance to the Free Syrian Army at a time when the Syrian government is escalating its use of force to include ballistic missiles as well as airstrikes. \n \n \u201cThey\u2019re not doing anything about the Scuds,\u201d Shishakly said, referring to the Syrian military\u2019s increasing use of Russian-designed missiles. \u201cAnd if they are not going to do anything about it, at least give us the tools to protect ourselves.\u201d \n \n Rebels and analysts said the real significance of the aid is that a portion will go directly to the Free Syrian Army\u2019s military councils, opening a formal channel between the U.S. government and the rebels for the first time. \n \n The councils were formed at the prodding of U.S. officials last year in an effort to make the ad hoc rebel army more effective by giving it a more coherent structure. But the councils have had limited success in coordinating the hundreds of rebel groups that have emerged to join the fight, among them some of the increasingly powerful Islamist groups that have chosen not to join the councils. \n \n A spokesman for the Damascus Military Council who goes by the nom de guerre Abu Qatada said he was deeply disappointed that the assistance package did not include arms. \n \n \u201cWe thank the American government for the aid,\u201d he said in an interview over Skype. \u201cHowever, we would like to point out that we do not need food at the moment. We would rather have weapons to defend ourselves and our children.\u201d \n \n If the assistance is intended to increase U.S. influence over the chaotic events unfolding on the battlefield, \u201cit will need a lot more than this,\u201d said Salman Shaikh, director of the Brookings Doha Center in Qatar. \u201cThe trajectory of the conflict is much more dangerous than that, and these kind of Band-Aids are not going to have a major impact on the ground.\u201d \n \n DeYoung reported from Washington.

He wrote that Maryland and the District had sufficiently argued that Trump\u2019s hotel \u201chas had and almost certainly will continue to have an unlawful effect on competition.\u201d \n \n As part of that ruling, Messitte said he rejected an argument made by critics of the lawsuit \u2014 that, under the Constitution, only Congress may decide whether the president has violated the emoluments clauses. \n \n \u201cIn absence of Congressional approval, this Court holds that it may review the actions of the President to determine if they comply with the law,\u201d Messitte wrote. \n \n If the ruling stands, it could allow Racine and Frosh to seek internal documents from the Trump Organization to determine how much money the Washington hotel has taken in from state and foreign governments. \n \n Messitte\u2019s ruling largely narrowed the lawsuit\u2019s scope to the Washington hotel, saying that the District and Maryland had standing to sue because they could plausibly claim to have been injured by Trump\u2019s receipt of payments from foreign and state governments. \n \n For one thing, he said, the two jurisdictions have financial interests in their own convention centers \u2014 one in downtown Washington, another in Bethesda, Md. They argued that the Trump hotel had an unfair advantage in the battle for meeting business. \n \n In addition, the court said, the District and Maryland could speak on behalf of their own businesses, which might also see clients lured away by the chance to do business with the president. \n \n \u201cThe Court concludes that [the District and Maryland] are, quite plausibly, trying to protect a large segment of their commercial residents and hospitality industry employees from economic harm,\u201d he wrote. \n \n Messitte also raised examples of state governments having to make decisions related to the president\u2019s company, which Frosh and Racine termed an \u201cintolerable dilemma\u201d between losing revenue or risking repercussions from the president. The judge cited a decision by District tax officials to lower the Trump hotel\u2019s tax bill by nearly $1 million and a $6 million tax break being granted to a Trump-affiliated development by Mississippi officials. \n \n The Justice Department, which is representing the president in this case, did not immediately say whether it would appeal. \u201cAs we argued, we believe this case should be dismissed, and we will continue to defend the president in court,\u201d spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said. \n \n After consulting with attorneys, Trump vowed last year to donate some profits from foreign governments to the U.S. treasury. This month the Trump Organization said it donated $151,470 but declined to explain how it came up with the amount. \n \n Although Trump said he gave up day-to-day management of his business while he is in the White House, he still owns his businesses and can withdraw money from them at any time. \n \n A statement from the Trump Organization said: \u201cWhile the Trump Organization is not a party to the lawsuit, the Court\u2019s decision today does significantly narrow the scope of the case. The Court has yet to rule on several additional arguments, which we believe should result in a complete dismissal.\u201d \n \n In an interview, Frosh said that \u201coverall we are extremely pleased\u201d and that he and Racine would be seeking the president\u2019s financial documents and tax returns as the case proceeded. \n \n \u201cThe basic principle here is Donald Trump is not above the law, and the court recognized that and said that we can enforce the nation\u2019s original anti-corruption law \u2014 the emoluments clause,\u201d he said. \n \n This case was filed last year, one of a raft of lawsuits in the months after Trump\u2019s inauguration, all of them alleging that he was violating the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clauses. \n \n Those clauses were dusty corners of the Constitution, rarely tested in court during 240-plus years of American history. \n \n One bars federal officers from taking presents, or emoluments, from foreign governments. The other prohibits presidents from taking side payments from individual states. \n \n In these lawsuits, the plaintiffs allege that Trump violated one or both of these bans, because foreign and state governments have rented hotel rooms or banquet halls at his businesses. \n \n Trump\u2019s attorneys have said that the term \u201cemolument\u201d was never meant to cover transactions such as this \u2014 not outright gifts to the president but purchases made at fair-market value. \n \n The first step in all these cases has been an argument over what lawyers call \u201cstanding\u201d \u2014 in essence, determining whether the plaintiff has a right to sue. \n \n In December, for instance, a federal judge threw out one of the emoluments lawsuits, brought by the nonprofit watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. \n \n U.S. District Judge George B. Daniels ruled that the watchdog group lacked standing. He stated that the Constitution gave Congress \u2014 and only Congress \u2014 the right to enforce these rules. \n \n \u201cAs the only political branch with the power to consent to violations of the Foreign Emoluments Clause, Congress is the appropriate body to determine whether, and to what extent, Defendant\u2019s conduct unlawfully infringes on that power,\u201d Daniels wrote in his ruling. \n \n The case involving the District and Maryland had a hearing earlier this year before Messitte at a federal court in Greenbelt, Md. \n \n In that hearing, the Justice Department, arguing on Trump\u2019s behalf, made a similar argument in an effort to throw out the attorney generals\u2019 suit. Brett Shumate, a Justice Department lawyer, said that states such as Maryland had no right to sue Trump over these clauses. \n \n \u201cThe states are not roving constitutional watchdogs,\u201d Shumate said. He continued: \u201cThis is ultimately a political dispute. It should be left to the political process.\u201d \n \n In his ruling Wednesday, Messitte rejected that idea. \n \n \u201cThe thrust of the President\u2019s argument that only Congress can act is particularly concerning,\u201d he wrote in a footnote. \u201cSuppose a majority (simple? two-thirds?) of Congress (the House? the Senate? both?) is controlled by one party \u2014 that of the President. And suppose the Congress never undertakes to approve or disapprove the President\u2019s receipt of such \u2018emoluments.\u2019 \u201d \n \n \u201cThe President could continue to receive unlimited \u2018emoluments\u2019 from foreign and state governments without the least oversight and with absolute impunity,\u201d Messitte wrote. ||||| Washington (CNN) A federal judge said Wednesday that a lawsuit alleging gifts or payments from foreign and domestic governments made to President Donald Trump may be illegal can proceed. \n \n But the ruling from Judge Peter Messitte of the US District Court of Maryland says the Maryland and District of Columbia attorneys general who brought the case will have to focus it on the Trump Organization's operations in Washington. That means the case going forward will challenge payments made by foreign officials for services at the Trump International Hotel, but will not include visits to Mar-a-Lago in Florida or other Trump properties. \n \n Maryland and DC have argued that the Trump International Hotel's operations put other nearby hotel and entertainment properties at a competitive disadvantage, and that the Trump hotel got special tax concessions. \n \n Messitte did not make any rulings on the allegations in the case, which accuse Trump of taking illegal gifts from foreign governments through his family's business, violating the Constitution's Emoluments Clause. \n \n Still, the judge hints at his feelings toward the Trump International Hotel. He notes multiple times, for instance, that foreign governments have moved business from the Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton hotels in Washington to the \"President's Hotel.\" \n \n Read More",

While Judge Peter Messitte of the US District Court of Maryland is allowing the lawsuit to move forward, he's limiting its scope to just the Trump International Hotel in DC, excluding Mar-a-Lago and other properties. The lawsuit accuses Trump International of getting special tax concessions and having a competitive advantage over other hotels. Messitte noted that foreign governments have moved their business from other DC hotels to the \"President's Hotel.\" He ruled that Trump's other properties are too far away to have any financial impact on Maryland or DC.

    "document": "SABATTUS \u2014 Controversial Republican candidate Leslie Gibson, who drew fire for insulting several teen survivors of the Florida school shooting, is abandoning his effort to win a state House seat this year. \n \n \u201cI am not walking away with my head hung low. I am walking away with my head held high,\u201d Gibson said Friday. \n \n Gibson said he made the decision after talking with his family, praying and discussing it with friends and colleagues, including Thomas Martin Jr., another Republican contender who entered the 57th District race Thursday. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s the best thing for everybody,\u201d Gibson said. \n \n Gibson has been under fire this week for comments he made online about the teens in Florida who survived a school shooting in Parkland, Florida. He criticized two of them who were leading an effort to increase restrictions on gun sales in the wake of the Feb. 14 killings, calling one a \u201cskinhead lesbian,\u201d and another a \u201cbald-faced liar.\u201d \n \n The 18-year-old student whom Gibson singled out, Emma Gonzalez, is among the students speaking out from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. In the wake of the Feb. 14 massacre there that left 17 of her classmates dead, she emerged as a leader in students\u2019 fight to make assault rifles harder to come by. \n \n \u201cThere is nothing about this skinhead lesbian that impresses me and there is nothing that she has to say unless you\u2019re a frothing at the mouth moonbat,\u201d Gibson wrote. \n \n Gibson said in another tweet that calling her a survivor, as many have done, is disingenuous because she \u201cwas in a completely different part of the school\u201d when students were gunned down. \n \n Gibson apologized in a later tweet, saying, \u201cI would like to extend to you my most sincere apology for how I addressed you. It was wrong and unacceptable. You are doing work that is important to you. I would like to extend my hand in friendship and understanding to you.\u201d \n \n Gibson said that during his career in the military, he took an oath \u201cto uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\u201d \n \n \u201cBecause of this,\u201d he said, \u201cI am very passionate about protecting our constitutional rights from those who seek their elimination. It was not appropriate to single out the Parkland students, but I stand firm in my defense of our constitutional rights.\u201d \n \n David Hogg, the other teen Gibson insulted, tweeted on Wednesday, urging someone to run against Gibson. \n \n \u201cWho wants to run against this hate-loving politician?\u201d asked Hogg, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. \u201cI don\u2019t care what party. JUST DO IT.\u201d \n \n Hogg has been an outspoken advocate for taking on the National Rifle Association. \n \n The incident that apparently set off Gibson was an appearance by Hogg on CNN in which the Parkland student lashed out at NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch. He accused her of working with gun manufacturers to control Congress. \n \n \u201cShe owns these congressmen. She can get them to do things,\u201d Hogg told the network. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t care about these children\u2019s lives,\u201d he said. \n \n Gibson, who retired from the U.S. Navy, for years has used social media to comment on immigration, defend conservative politicians and promote Republican policies. He has a history of retweeting stridently anti-immigrant comments, often from accounts in Maine. \n \n Last month, he explained on Facebook after \u201cthe tragedy that occurred in Florida\u201d that there has been \u201ca lot of misinformation, and flat out lies\u201d circulated by \u201cthe liberal media and leftist anti-Second Amendment groups.\u201d \n \n As a lifetime member of the NRA, he said, he stands with the group\u2019s efforts \u201cto protect and preserve our Second Amendment rights,\u201d which he said are \u201cunder attack.\u201d \n \n \u201cThe NRA and its members are being blamed for the Florida tragedy,\u201d Gibson wrote. \u201cSuch blame is patently misdirected. The blame rests solely with the person who committed these murders.\u201d \n \n He made his social media accounts private after the uproar over his insults aimed at the teens. \n \n Gibson had been cruising toward an unopposed election in the district, which includes Sabattus and Greene. But his comments stirred both Martin and Democrat Eryn Gilchrist to join the contest. \n \n Gilchrist filed the required paperwork on Thursday to run for the 57th District seat. \n \n She said she never anticipated running for office but felt so \u201chorrified and embarrassed\u201d at the thought of Gibson representing her that she decided to jump in. \n \n \u201cI would really have been happy to partake in representative democracy by voting,\u201d Gilchrist said. \n \n Gilchrist, 28, a Connecticut native who works for a medical device company based in Bowdoin, is a 2013 graduate of Bates College. \n \n Martin said on Thursday he felt compelled to run after he read Gibson\u2019s strident comments about the two Florida students. \n \n Martin, a former state senator from Benton, said it is important to have a candidate who represents real Republican values. \n \n \u201cAfter those recent unfortunate comments, I couldn\u2019t sit back,\u201d Martin said. \n \n Martin, a 52-year-old contractor, said that people have to realize \u201cthat our words and actions have consequences.\u201d \n \n Gibson said he hopes his departure from the race will bring things back to normal. \n \n He said he\u2019s going to try to \u201cget some peace and quiet in our lives\u201d after the turmoil of recent days. \n \n [email protected] \n \n Share \n \n < Previous \n \n Next > \n \n filed under: ||||| In the past month, the vocal teenage survivors of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, with their ballooning social-media followings and national TV appearances, have emerged as the newest and youngest voices in the push to beef up gun-control laws in the United States. \n \n And critics who have bad-mouthed the teens on the Internet or the airwaves have found their own vitriol turned back on them by people sympathetic to the plight of students who became activists after seeing their classmates and educators slaughtered. \n \n There was the aide to a Florida legislator who was fired after he called the school shooting survivors crisis actors who travel from tragic place to tragic place making impassioned but bogus political pleas to take away gun rights.

They are worried because it raises more concerns about stability of the high-rise that's now leaning 18 inches. When Investigative Reporter Jaxon Van Derbeken first broke this story on Tuesday, residents inside the tower did not want to talk. On Wednesday, several residents talked with him to discuss their concerns. (Published Wednesday, Sept. 5, 2018) \n \n City inspectors issued a notice of violation on Tuesday, giving the Millennium management 72 hours to report back on the extent of the problem and the soundness of the building\u2019s fa\u00e7ade in light of the failure. \n \n Residents started hearing creaking sounds followed by a loud popping noise at 2:30 a.m. Saturday. Soon afterward, one owner found the crack in his window in a 36th floor unit in the north western corner of the 58-story high-rise. The tower is currently tilting some 18 inches when measured at the top. \n \n A look at the crack on a window in a 36th floor unit of San Francisco's Millennium Tower. \n \n \n \n San Francisco City Supervisor Aaron Peskin notes the failed window was supposed to withstand hurricane force winds. \n \n \u201cWhen you have a window at the 36th floor that cracks in the middle of the night that is a big wake up call,\u201d says Peskin, who has held a series of hearings into why the tower has been sinking so dramatically. \n \n Video Millennium Tower Cited for Fire Safety Danger \n \n In a bulletin about the latest problem sent to owners on Labor Day and obtained by NBC Bay Area, building manager Michael Scofield assured them a team of experts would soon assess what he described as \u201ca large piece of glass that cracked.\u201d \n \n Scofield acknowledged it\u2019s \u201cpossible that this incident is related to other issues in the building.\u201d \n \n A string of problems may have been triggered by differential settlement of the structure -- everything from cracks in the basement walls to strange odors permeating some units. \n \n The issue of who is to blame has become mired in a legal morass. As the building continues to sink and tilt, NBC Bay Area has detailed concerns by experts about the possibility the fa\u00e7ade of the building, known as the curtain wall, may be separating from the interior structure. \n \n That could pose a risk, they say, that a fire could spread through gaps between floors. The failure of the 36th floor window could be evidence of strain on the steel lattice that forms the fa\u00e7ade. \n \n For now, Millennium manager Scofield told residents the barrier will remain out front along Mission Street until repairs are made. \n \n \u201cThis is a public safety hazard,\u201d Peskin says of the window failure, adding that the city Department of Building Inspection must act immediately to assure the safety of thousands of people who walk by the building every day. \n \n \u201cThe real question is do we need to limit pedestrian access on the sidewalks beneath the Millennium?\u201d he says. \u201cI want our Department of Building Inspection to make that decision and pronto.\u201d \n \n Investigative Test Drilling Launched at the Sinking Millennium Tower \n \n Department of Building Inspection spokesman William Strawn said in a statement late Tuesday that per the building engineer\u2019s comments to the city inspector, \u201cIt does not appear to present any sidewalk safety issue at this time. We will be following up.\u201d",

    "document": "There\u2019s no denying that sperm whales are amazing. As some of Earth\u2019s largest mammals, they have the largest brain of any creature on the planet and can weigh up to 45 tons. But it turns out that the most impressive secrets of these huge animals are found in something much smaller: Their DNA. As John R. Platt writes for Hakai Magazine, modern sperm whales seem to have all descended from a single female. \n \n A new study published in the journal Molecular Ecology reveals that deep within sperm whale\u2019s mitochondrial DNA\u2014genes passed on from mother to child\u2014lie connections to a single, \u201cEve\u201d-like whale. \n \n The researchers analyzed mitochondrial DNA from 1,633 whales and found low genetic diversity. But that was no surprise: Past research has demonstrated that many of what scientists call \u201cmegafauna\u201d (really big animals) aren\u2019t that genetically diverse. \n \n In 2002, for example, researchers found that killer whales lack diversity in their genes despite their large population size\u2014likely due to some past event that once dramatically reduced their population. It turns out that other species lack diversity, too, because of everything from preferences for the same breeding grounds to loyalty to a certain kind of food. \n \n So the study\u2019s lead author, Alana Alexander, expected to find low diversity, Platt reports. But she found even lower diversity than she imagined. More data didn\u2019t help uncover more diversity\u2014instead, it confirmed ties to a single female whale who, at some point in the last 80,000 years, became the \u201cmother\u201d of all sperm whales who followed. \n \n Though it would make sense to have a single mother in a single area\u2014an ancestor who, say, really loved the Pacific Ocean\u2014this mom\u2019s genes have been found in sperm whales all over the world. \n \n How this happened remains unknown and is even stranger given sperm whales\u2019 social structures. Sperm whales are matrilineal, meaning most females stick together and males come and go, which would limit how far a female's genes could travel. \n \n Yet these social structures now restrict the ability of sperm whales to differentiate and prevent new DNA from getting into the stream. Right now, it seems that sperm whale populations are \u201cshaped by females being \u2018home-bodies\u2019\u2014at the social group, regional and oceanic level,\u201d Alexander said in a release. \n \n This lack of diversity leaves the whales more susceptible to things like climate change that disturb their preferred habitat. This, in turn, can also threaten future diversity, preventing the whales from straying too far from their region and mixing with others. \n \n Sperm whales may have an elusive \u201cEve,\u201d but today\u2019s moms will need to get out more for the sake of their species. ||||| The interplay of natural selection and genetic drift, influenced by geographic isolation, mating systems and population size, determines patterns of genetic diversity within species. The sperm whale provides an interesting example of a long\u2010lived species with few geographic barriers to dispersal. Worldwide mtDNA diversity is relatively low, but highly structured among geographic regions and social groups, attributed to female philopatry. However, it is unclear whether this female philopatry is due to geographic regions or social groups, or how this might vary on a worldwide scale. To answer these questions, we combined mtDNA information for 1091 previously published samples with 542 newly obtained DNA profiles (394\u2010bp mtDNA, sex, 13 microsatellites) including the previously unsampled Indian Ocean, and social group information for 541 individuals. We found low mtDNA diversity (\u03c0 = 0.430%) reflecting an expansion event <80 000 years bp, but strong differentiation by ocean, among regions within some oceans, and among social groups. In comparison, microsatellite differentiation was low at all levels, presumably due to male\u2010mediated gene flow. A hierarchical amova showed that regions were important for explaining mtDNA variance in the Indian Ocean, but not Pacific, with social group sampling in the Atlantic too limited to include in analyses. Social groups were important in partitioning mtDNA and microsatellite variance within both oceans. Therefore, both geographic philopatry and social philopatry influence genetic structure in the sperm whale, but their relative importance differs by sex and ocean, reflecting breeding behaviour, geographic features and perhaps a more recent origin of sperm whales in the Pacific. By investigating the interplay of evolutionary forces operating at different temporal and geographic scales, we show that sperm whales are perhaps a unique example of a worldwide population expansion followed by rapid assortment due to female social organization.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 While investigating samples of toxic levels of heavy metals found in sperm whales, researchers stumbled upon a surprising discovery: All of today's sperm whales appear to have descended from the same female, reports Hakai magazine. They've named her Eve and say she lived between 10,000 and 80,000 years ago. In the journal Molecular Ecology, the researchers explain that the genetic diversity of the whales, one of the planet's largest animals, turns out to be even lower than previously thought. The key was locked away in the species' mitochondrial DNA, a type of DNA passed down through the generations from mothers, not fathers. Conducting genetic tests on 542 samples collected over the past six years by Ocean Alliance and comparing them to another 1,000 whales analyzed in the past 15 years, they found that a single female whale left her thumbprint on all of them. Which doesn't quite make sense given that mothers tend to dominate certain areas without moving around, so the spread of one set of genes across the globe would be unusual. Somewhere along the line one mother whale and her descendants were able to out-compete all other females alive at the time\u2014perhaps there was a sudden global population decline, or female whale behavior was dramatically different then\u2014and their genetic lineage took off. One drawback is that this lack of diversity makes the whales more susceptible to things such as climate change, notes Smithsonian, suggesting that \"today\u2019s moms will need to get out more for the sake of their species.\" (Check out what one diver was sprayed with when encountering a diving sperm whale.)",

    "document": "A new study has found no direct link between antidepressant use during pregnancy and one type of birth defect. \n \n The research, published in today\u2019s issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, comes nine years after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned that exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors \u2014 the most commonly prescribed antidepressants \u2014 might increase the risk of heart malformations in the developing fetus. ||||| WEDNESDAY, June 18, 2014 (HealthDay News) -- Antidepressants taken during the first three months of pregnancy don't appear to increase the risk of heart defects in babies, new research suggests. \n \n However, this latest study contradicts previous research that found that taking antidepressants in pregnancy can be risky. \n \n The question is an important one because depression is common in pregnancy. It's diagnosed in 10 percent to 20 percent of pregnant women, and up to 13 percent of women take antidepressants while pregnant, according to the researchers. \n \n \"The most critical period in the development of an embryo or in the growth of a particular organ is during the time of most rapid cell division,\" said Krista Huybrechts, lead study author and epidemiologist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, in Boston. So, it is in the first three months of pregnancy that the risk for developing major malformations is highest, she explained. \n \n The U.S. government-funded research was published in the June 19 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. \n \n The current study's findings run counter to two previous studies that caused the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2005 to formally warn health care professionals that early prenatal exposure to paroxetine (Paxil) may increase the risk of heart malformations at birth. \n \n Huybrechts and her team had some concerns about the earlier research and wanted to re-examine the evidence by designing their study differently. They tightened the focus and took more factors that could interfere with the data into account, she said. The team looked at whether antidepressants, including those called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs -- such as paroxetine (Paxil) and sertraline (Zoloft) -- are indeed associated with an increased risk of heart defects at birth. \n \n The researchers tapped data from 46 states and Washington, D.C., from 2000 through 2007. They were able to use demographic information, such as age, income and education, as well as data about all physician services and hospitalizations, including diagnoses, procedures and filled outpatient prescriptions. \n \n A total of almost a million women who had given birth were included in the study. They were all on Medicaid without supplementary private insurance. All of the women were between 12 to 55 years of age. Women were excluded if they had been treated with drugs that have been associated with birth defects (such as chemotherapy, lithium, retinoids and thalidomide) or if their infants had been diagnosed with a genetic abnormality. ||||| Data Source and Study Cohort \n \n The study cohort was drawn from the Medicaid Analytic eXtract for 46 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., for the period of 2000 through 2007. Montana and Connecticut were excluded because of difficulty in linking data for mothers and infants, Michigan was excluded because of incomplete data, and data from Arizona were not available. The Medicaid Analytic eXtract data set contains individual-level demographic and Medicaid enrollment information, as well as data on all physician services and hospitalizations and the accompanying diagnoses and procedures and all filled outpatient medication prescriptions. \n \n The development of our study cohort has been described previously.22 Briefly, we identified all completed pregnancies in women and adolescents 12 to 55 years of age (hereafter, \u201cwomen\u201d) and linked these pregnancies to liveborn infants. Using a validated algorithm,23 we estimated the date of the last menstrual period on the basis of the delivery date and diagnostic codes indicative of preterm delivery. Finally, we required all the women to be eligible for Medicaid, without supplementary private insurance or restricted benefits, from 3 months before the last menstrual period through 1 month after delivery. We excluded pregnancies in which the infant had received a diagnosis of a chromosomal abnormality (1609 pregnancies) and pregnancies in which the mother had been treated with known teratogens during the first trimester (i.e., lithium, antineoplastic agents, retinoids, and thalidomide; 2476 pregnancies). \n \n Study Conduct \n \n The study was approved by the institutional review board of Brigham and Women's Hospital, and the need for informed consent was waived. The authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the analyses reported as well as for the fidelity of the report to the study protocol. \n \n Antidepressant Medications \n \n The etiologically relevant window for exposure extended from the date of the last menstrual period through day 90 of pregnancy (first trimester). We determined maternal use of antidepressants by a review of pharmacy dispensing records, using the dispensing date and the number of days of supply. Women were considered to have had exposure if the days of supply overlapped with the first trimester. We defined the following exposure categories: any SSRI, paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin\u2013norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), bupropion, and other antidepressants (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). The reference group consisted of women without exposure to antidepressants during the first trimester. \n \n Cardiac Malformations \n \n Congenital cardiac malformations were identified on the basis of the presence of inpatient or outpatient diagnostic codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), in the maternal or infant records during the first 90 days after delivery. We used both maternal and infant codes because an infant's claims may be recorded under the mother's identification number for the first several months after birth.24 On the basis of previously reported associations,13,14,19 outcomes were grouped in the following categories: any cardiac malformation, right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, ventricular septal defect, and other cardiac malformation (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). We excluded anomalies related to prematurity (e.g., patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary-valve stenosis, and anomalies of the pulmonary artery in preterm infants).25 A given outcome was considered to be present if there was more than one date with the respective diagnostic codes recorded or if there was one diagnostic code and a code for a cardiac procedure or surgery (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The positive predictive values for these outcome definitions did not differ substantially according to exposure and ranged from 66.7 to 79.5% in a conservative validation study that was based on review of primary medical records in a subset of cases.26 \n \n Covariates \n \n The information on covariates that were being taken into consideration in the adjustment for confounding or that were being used for stratification was obtained during the baseline period (from the time before the last menstrual period through the end of the first trimester). In addition to sociodemographic information (year of delivery, state of residence, age, race, and parity), we considered known or suspected risk factors for congenital cardiac malformations and proxies for such risk factors: multiple gestation, chronic maternal illness (hypertension, diabetes, epilepsy, and renal disease), use of suspected teratogenic medications, use of other psychotropic medications (anticonvulsant, antipsychotic, anxiolytic, and hypnotic agents; other benzodiazepines; and barbiturates), use of antidiabetic and antihypertensive medications, and the number of distinct prescription drugs used, excluding antidepressants, as a general marker of coexisting conditions.27 To address confounding by the underlying indication, we considered proxies for depression severity (number of depression diagnoses received as an outpatient and as an inpatient) and other indications for antidepressant use (other mental health disorders, pain-related diagnoses, sleep disorders, the premenstrual tension syndrome, smoking, and the chronic fatigue syndrome). \n \n Statistical Analysis \n \n We compared the distributions of sociodemographic, clinical, and health care utilization characteristics among the various exposure groups, and we calculated the absolute risks of cardiac malformations. Logistic-regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios for cardiac malformations and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Because the odds ratio is an excellent approximation of the risk ratio in the case of rare outcomes, the results are referred to as relative risks.28 Use of the robust variance estimator to account for correlations within women with multiple pregnancies did not change the confidence intervals appreciably, so correlation structures were omitted from all the analyses. \n \n Results are presented for analyses performed according to three levels of adjustment: an unadjusted analysis; an analysis restricted to women with a depression diagnosis, to control for the potential effect of the underlying illness or factors associated with it; and an analysis restricted to women with a depression diagnosis and performed with the use of propensity-score stratification to further control for proxies of depression severity and other potential confounders.29 Propensity scores were derived from the predicted probability of treatment estimated in a logistic-regression model that contained all the covariates listed above without additional variable selection. We created 100 equally sized propensity-score strata, dropped uninformative strata (i.e., all strata that did not contain at least one treated woman and one untreated woman), and stratified the outcome models according to these propensity-score strata. In all cases, less than 0.5% of treated women and less than 0.1% of untreated women were included in the dropped strata. \n \n In confirmatory analyses, we used a high-dimensional propensity-score algorithm, which evaluates thousands of diagnoses, procedures, and pharmacy-claim codes to identify and prioritize covariates that serve as proxies for unmeasured confounders. A total of 200 empirically identified confounders were selected and were combined with investigator-identified covariates to improve adjustment for confounding.30 No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. \n \n We performed prespecified subgroup and sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of the primary results (for any cardiac malformation). Because the cohort we studied was younger and more racially diverse than cohorts in previous studies,13,14 we tested for effect modification according to age (<30 years vs. \u226530 years) and race or ethnic group (white vs. nonwhite). We conducted dose\u2013response analyses for low, medium, and high doses of antidepressants using the first and highest doses dispensed (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).31 In the analysis of SSRIs, we stratified the analysis according to the use of just that drug class versus the use of multiple antidepressant classes. \n \n To evaluate the effect of potential misclassification of exposure, we redefined exposure status as having had one or more prescriptions filled during the first trimester (as compared with days of supply that overlap with the first trimester); we redefined the reference group as women with no antidepressant exposure throughout pregnancy. To evaluate the effect of potential misclassification of outcome, we restricted the outcome to inpatient diagnoses only and extended infant follow-up to 1 year. We corrected odds ratios for outcome misclassification using sensitivities and specificities consistent with the positive predictive values estimated in the internal validation study.26,32 To further assess whether outcomes were well captured, we evaluated some well-known associations in our data set \u2014 in particular, associations between cardiac malformations and maternal diabetes, use of an anticonvulsant agent, or multifetal pregnancy.33",

    "document": "The council's decision is part of a broader national effort to alleviate poverty, said Maria Elena Durazo, former head of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor. Raising the wage in L.A., she said, will help spur similar increases in other parts of the country. \n \n \n \n \"Without a doubt, it was a very big victory,\" said Durazo, now with Unite Here, the hotel and restaurant workers' union. \n \n \n \n Some labor leaders have expressed dissatisfaction with the gradual timeline elected leaders set for raising base wages. But on Tuesday the harshest criticism of the law came from business groups, which warned lawmakers that the mandate would force employers to lay off workers or leave the city altogether. \n \n \n \n \"The very people [council members'] rhetoric claims to help with this action, it's going to hurt,\" said Ruben Gonzalez, the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce's senior vice president for public policy and political affairs. \n \n \n \n He predicted that many businesses would absorb their new labor costs by laying off employees, reducing work hours or moving out of the city entirely. \n \n \n \n \"It's simple math,\" Gonzalez said. \"There is simply not enough room, enough margin in these businesses to absorb a 50-plus percent increase in labor costs over a short period of time.\" \n \n \n \n Councilman Mitchell Englander, the council's only Republican, cast the lone opposing vote. In a statement, he said the council action could \"make it impossible for entire industries to do business\" in Los Angeles. \n \n \n \n \"The very last thing that we should be doing as a city is creating a competitive disadvantage for our businesses with those in neighboring cities,\" said Englander, who represents the northwest San Fernando Valley. \n \n \n \n The council's vote followed months of public debate and back-room lobbying on an issue that has animated City Hall like few others over the last year. Unlike some of the neighborhood-specific political dust-ups that occupy city officials, the pay increase would directly affect workers and businesses throughout the city. \n \n \n \n \"That's a monumental change in wages,\" said Jerry Newman, a professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo School of Management. \"It's going to have both an economic impact and a social impact.\" \n \n \n \n The stakes for some low-wage Angelenos were reflected Tuesday in testimony from workers such as Juan Moran, a line cook in Little Tokyo. Moran told the council the current statewide minimum wage of $9 per hour isn't enough to live on. \n \n \n \n \"Sometimes I have to walk half an hour from work to get to my apartment because money's not enough to pay a ride on the bus,\" the Boyle Heights resident said. \"Or I work 12 hours straight without stop \u2026 just to pay rent.\" \n \n \n \n Backed by well-organized labor activists at the national level, the campaign to raise the minimum wage has become a focus of Democrats seeking to revive their party's focus on income inequality. Once Los Angeles' wage hike is finalized, the city will join other West Coast cities that have enacted higher minimum wages in the last two years. \n \n \n \n New York City and Washington, D.C., are also weighing $15-an-hour minimum wage proposals. \n \n \n \n Jaime Regalado, emeritus professor of political science at Cal State L.A., said L.A.'s move on the minimum wage fits in with California's experimentation with left-leaning policies such as regulating greenhouse-gas emissions. \n \n \n \n The state \"has been out front on a variety of things that are not as rapidly moving nationally,\" Regalado said. \n \n \n \n L.A.'s proposed wage increase, he said, is \"consistent with what we've seen as California has grown increasingly blue, especially urban centers like Los Angeles.\" \n \n \n \n In L.A., the move toward a higher citywide minimum wage gathered steam last year as council members pursued a plan to raise the base pay for workers at the city's large hotels to $15.37 per hour. That measure passed last fall. \n \n \n \n Newly elected council members representing diverse areas of the city \u2014 Mike Bonin from an affluent coastal district, Curren Price from South Los Angeles and Nury Martinez from the San Fernando Valley \u2014 led the push for the hotel pay increase, which proponents saw as a precursor to a citywide minimum wage hike. \n \n \n \n Last summer, minimum-wage advocates found a key ally in Garcetti, who put forward his own proposal to raise base pay to $13.25 an hour. \n \n \n \n In a telephone interview from New York City, where he was speaking at Columbia University, the mayor praised the measure passed by the council. ||||| City follows Seattle and San Francisco in raising minimum wage to $15 by July 2020, with city council members voting overwhelmingly in favour of legislation \n \n Los Angeles became the largest US city to raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour on Tuesday, as a wage increase bill passed the city council by a vote of 14-1. \n \n It is now up to city attorney Mike Feuer to draft an ordinance to implement the new minimum wage requirements. The ordinance will then return to the council for a final vote before becoming law. Under the proposed legislation, the city\u2019s minimum wage would increase to $10.50 in July 2016, and would increase incrementally every year until it reaches $15 in July 2020. For small businesses with 25 or fewer employees, the wage hike would come on a modified schedule with the incremental increases starting in July 2017 and the minimum wage reaching $15 by July 2021. \n \n Seattle workers hail 'historic moment' as city sets course for $15 minimum wage Read more \n \n The current minimum wage in California is $9 an hour and is set to increase to $10 in January 2016. \n \n \n \n In the past year, two other US cities have approved similar wage increase measures. In June 2014, Seattle moved to increase its minimum wage to $15 by 2017. Last November, San Francisco voted to increase its minimum wage to $15 by 2018. \n \n Other cities, including New York and Chicago, are considering raising their minimum wage to $15 an hour. In February,New York City mayor Bill de Blasio called for a $15 minimum wage by 2019 in his state of the city address. \n \n The shift toward raising the minimum wage by local lawmakers comes at a time when the fight for $15 movement has swelled into the largest protest by low-wage workers in US history. On 15 April, some 60,000 workers in more than 200 US cities took part in the Fight for $15 demonstrations. Many of them were low-wage employees of companies like Walmart and McDonald\u2019s, which have since pledged to increase their workers\u2019 pay by $1-$2 an hour, a raise activists said is still not enough. \n \n Who would oppose a $15 minimum wage? Sometimes your neighbour Read more \n \n \u201cBy voting to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, the Los Angeles City Council has just shown what workers are capable of when we stick together. People used to think we had no chance, but we are steadily winning the fight by demanding $15 an hour to lift our families out of poverty,\u201d said Albina Ardon, 29, a mother of two and an active member of the Fight for $15 in Los Angeles. \n \n Ardon, who has worked for McDonald\u2019s for 10 years, earns $9.05 an hour and relies on food stamps and Medi-Cal to make ends meet. \n \n \u201cMy life would be completely different if I were paid $15 an hour. I could afford groceries without needing food stamps, my family could stop sharing our apartment with renters for extra money, and I\u2019d be able to provide my daughters with some security.\u201d \n \n The federally mandated minimum wage has stayed at $7.25 since June 2009. While the unemployment rate has dropped to 5.4% \u2013 a seven-year low \u2013 and the number of jobless claim is at a 15-year low, wages remain stagnant. \n \n President Barack Obama previously called on Congress to raise it to $10.10 . Democrats, led by Washington senator Patty Murray and Congressman Bobby Scott recently introduced a bill that would raise federal minimum wage to $12 an hour by 2020. \n \n Advocates for higher minimum wage like Unite Here and Raise the Wage attended the Los Angeles city council hearing on Tuesday. Prior to the vote, the council opened the proposal to debate and allowed each of the sides 25 minutes to make their arguments for and against the $15 minimum wage. Those on the opposing side included small business owners and restaurant owners, who said that higher minimum wage would force them to increase prices or let go of some of their staff. \n \n Genaro Molina (@GenaroMolina47) Members of Unite Here wait for Los Angeles City Council to vote on plan to raise the minimum wage. pic.twitter.com/ucr0plYtpa \n \n Council member Bernard Parks has previously expressed concern about $15 minimum wage leading to higher unemployment in the area. \n \n \n \n \u201cEvery minimum wage increase that we\u2019ve seen, if it\u2019s too high, causes unemployment,\u201d Parks told NPR in February. \u201cIf you have a big city like Los Angeles doing something, you\u2019re going to find a lot of people will fall in line without any thought, because they believe that we\u2019ve done the research. The fact is, we have not done the research.\u201d \n \n The city has commissioned a report from the Institute for Research on Labor Employment from University of California, Berkeley. The report found that by increasing minimum wage to $15.25 by 2019, as some city council members had suggested in the past, would affect 542,000 workers by 2017. \n \n \u201cBy 2019, we estimate that 609,000, or 41.3% of the covered workforce, will receive a wage increase from the proposed law,\u201d the researchers wrote in March 2015. \u201cAverage annual earnings will increase by 30.4%, or $4,800 in 2014 dollars.\u201d \n \n While higher pay may lead to higher prices and to a drop in consumer spending, those who will get a pay raise thank to the new bill are more likely to spend more, according to the researchers. \n \n These findings did not appease opponents of the $15 an hour minimum wage, who have said that the report is not independent. Since the institute conducted a similar study on the effects of increasing the minimum wage to $13.25 by 2017 as proposed by the Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti last year, the opponents felt that commissioning the institute to conduct this years study was a conflict of interest. \n \n \u201cI asked for an independent study. Selecting UC Berkeley again for this independent analysis does not pass the smell test with me,\u201d city councilman Mitch O\u2019Farrell said in January. \n \n Both Seattle and San Francisco have populations of less than one million, whereas Los Angeles population is more than 3.88 million people. The effects of increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour on that large of a scale remain unknown, which is something that continues to worry Los Angeles lawmakers. \n \n \u201cThis is an experiment,\u201d Paul Koretz said during Tuesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cIf anyone tells you they know exactly how this is going to go \u2026 they\u2019re not being honest with you.\u201d \n \n Despite concerns about the possible effects of increasing minimum wage to $15 an hour, two hours into Tuesday\u2019s hearing, the proposal passed. Worker rights advocates declared the vote a win for the low-wage workers. \n \n \u201cBy a vote of 14 to 1, the council directed L.A.\u2019s city attorney to prepare legislation setting a $15 wage floor,\u201d said Christine Owens, executive director of the National Employment Law Project. \u201cToday, Los Angeles becomes the latest and largest city to throw its support behind the legions of workers who ask for nothing less than to be paid a fair and decent wage.\u201d ||||| \u201cThe effects here will be the biggest by far,\u201d said Michael Reich, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who was commissioned by city leaders to conduct several studies on the potential effects of a minimum-wage increase. \u201cThe proposal will bring wages up in a way we haven\u2019t seen since the 1960s. There\u2019s a sense spreading that this is the new norm, especially in areas that have high costs of housing.\u201d \n \n Image Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles, right, on Monday. He said in an interview on Tuesday that \u201cwe\u2019re leading the country.\u201d Credit Nick Ut/Associated Press \n \n The groups pressing for higher minimum wages said that the Los Angeles vote could set off a wave of increases across Southern California, and that higher pay scales would improve the way of life for the region\u2019s vast low-wage work force. \n \n Supporters of higher wages say they hope the move will reverberate nationally. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York announced this month that he was convening a state board to consider a wage increase in the local fast-food industry, which could be enacted without a vote in the State Legislature. Immediately after the Los Angeles vote, pressure began to build on Mr. Cuomo to reject an increase that falls short of $15 an hour. \n \n \u201cThe L.A. increase nudges it forward,\u201d said Dan Cantor, the national director of the Working Families Party, which was founded in New York and has helped pass progressive economic measures in several states. \u201cIt puts an exclamation point on the need for $15 to be where the wage board ends up.\u201d \n \n The current minimum wage in New York State is $8.75, versus a federal minimum wage of $7.25, and will rise to $9 at the end of 2015. A little more than one-third of workers citywide and statewide now make below $15 an hour. \n \n Los Angeles County is also considering a measure that would lift the wages of thousands of workers in unincorporated parts of the county.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The push for a higher minimum wage just got a major boost courtesy of Los Angeles. The city council has approved raising it to $15 an hour by 2020, reports the Los Angeles Times. Under the plan, the rate will rise from $9 to $10.50 in July 2016, then tick up annually to $12, $13.25, $14.25, and $15. Businesses with 25 or fewer workers will get an extra year to phase it in. Though a handful of other cities have voted for a $15 rate, including Seattle, Los Angeles is the biggest city to do so. The move doesn't become official until the city attorney's office drafts an ordinance and sends it back to council members for their approval, but once it does, it's going to affect a lot of people, notes the New York Times. The newspaper cites one study showing that about 40% of workers in the city make less than $15 an hour.

    "document": "More than 40 injured after avalanche struck while students were climbing near Nasu Onsen ski resort north of Tokyo \n \n Seven high school students and a teacher have died and more than 40 people have been injured after an avalanche hit ski slopes in Japan. \n \n A total of 52 students and 11 teachers from seven high schools were taking part in a three-day mountaineering expedition near the Nasu Onsen resort, 93 miles (150km) north of Tokyo, when the incident occurred at about 9.20am (00.20am GMT) on Monday. \n \n Seven students and one teacher were found with no vital signs, rescue officials said. Of the many others who were injured, two students were believed to be in a serious condition. \n \n \u201cI cannot have peace of mind until I see the students\u2019 faces,\u201d the deputy headteacher of one of the affected schools told the Yomiuri newspaper. \n \n \n \n Japan\u2019s self-defence force was asked to help with the disaster response, which was at times hampered by weather conditions. The prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe, said the government would ensure the rescue was a top priority. \n \n The avalanche followed heavy snowfall overnight. More than 1ft (30cm) of snow accumulated in the Nasu highlands between midnight and 9am, according to Japan Meteorological Agency data. \n \n One unidentified student told the broadcaster NHK by telephone that there was a strong wind and he could see a white mass heading towards him. An instructor said to get down and then everyone was engulfed, he said. \n \n As the scale of the tragedy came to light, questions were raised about whether it could have been prevented. A police inquiry has been opened, the Kyodo news agency reported. \n \n Official avalanche advisories were in force in the area at the time. It is understood that climbing was stopped on the final day due to bad weather and the students instead participated in an exercise to wade through deep snow. \n \n The head of the high school athletics league that organised the course, Kenichi Hashimoto, said he had respected the assessment of the experienced teachers who were on the scene.

By adjusting the magnetic field changes with a computer, they navigated their creation towards a fixed point. \n \n This means the little robots could be useful for positioning materials in nanomanufacturing, or for medical purposes. \"It opens up a lot of applications, from targeted drug delivery to in vitro fertilisation - where you want to reach precise locations,\" Dr Misra said. \n \n For these ideas to work, the researchers need to test the technique in more complicated environments. They are moving on to those experiments, as well as working on making their \"MagnetoSperm\" smaller and faster. \n \n Image copyright SPL Image caption Human sperm are another six times smaller than the tiny robots that were modelled on them \n \n Dr Matthew Baker, who studies molecular motors at the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute in Sydney, told BBC News the work was \"very cool\" but commented that the tiny contraptions are not robots in the sense that most of us would imagine. \n \n \"It's just a piece of metal and it's the field that's doing the hard work,\" Dr Baker explained. \"The clever part is the oscillating, small, tunable magnetic field.\" \n \n This out-sourcing of power and navigation is what allows the gadget to be so small, according to the new study's first author Dr Islam Khalil. \"As technology progresses and many products get smaller, it becomes difficult to assemble objects on nano- and micro-scales,\" he said in a press statement. \n \n \"MagnetoSperm can be used to manipulate and assemble objects at these scales, using an external source of magnetic field to control its motion.\" ||||| Just when you thought you'd seen every kind of robot there is, researchers develop bots inspired by sperm. \n \n The tiny robots mimic the shape and movement of sperm cells and can be steered using magnetic fields. Dubbed \"MagnetoSperm,\" the robots could be useful for administering medicine or carrying out in vitro fertilization, researchers say. \n \n \"Nature has designed efficient tools for locomotion at micro scales,\" study leader Sarthak Misra, a mechanical engineer at the University of Twente in the Netherlands, said in a statement. [The 6 Strangest Robots Ever Created] \n \n Improvements in technology are making many products smaller, but it is difficult to assemble objects on the nanoscale (a billionth of a meter) or microscale (a millionth of a meter), the researchers said. \n \n Misra and a team of scientists at his university and the German University in Cairo design robots inspired by nature or ones that use living microorganisms, such as magnetically propelled bacteria and sperm cells, for performing complex tasks on small scales. \n \n In a new study, published today (June 2) in the journal Applied Physics Letters, the researchers created 322 1-micron-long (about 10 times the width of a human hair) robots with heads thickly coated with cobalt-nickel, but uncoated tails. \n \n When the sperm bots were exposed to an oscillating magnetic field with a strength less than that of a refrigerator magnet, the force caused the sperm bots' heads to rotate and their tails to move back and forth, pushing the bots forward. The researchers steered the robots by aiming the magnetic field toward a reference point. \n \n The magnetic swimmers could be used for a number of biomedical applications, including drug administration, in vitro fertilization and the cleaning of clogged arteries, the researchers said. \n \n The robots were assembled by a method known as spin coating, in which a thin polymer film is deposited onto a silicon wafer. The researchers chose a polymer that was simple to fabricate and wouldn't break down easily. They then used an electron beam to deposit the cobalt-nickel layer onto the heads of the bots. \n \n The researchers plan to scale down their robots to an even smaller size and develop a magnetic nanofiber that could be used for the tails. \n \n Follow Tanya Lewis on Twitter and Google+.

It was undergoing routine cleaning when maintenance staff discovered the two small tins. \n \n \u201cThere was a bomb scare immediately when the bags were spotted in two separate toilets at round 1 a.m., but later we found they contained 12 pieces of gold bars in each,\u201d Additional Commissioner of Customs at the airport, Rameshwar Meena, told Reuters. \n \n \u201cThe gold bars are from Dubai for sure. The flight had come from Patna to Kolkata last, but its basic route is Dubai-Mumbai.\u201d \n \n The bars weigh 1 kg (2.2 pounds) and are about the same size as a portable smart phone. Meena said the haul was worth 73.68 million rupees ($1.18 million). Customs officials said there had been five cases over two months involving a total 100 kg. \n \n \u201cWe feel that what we catch is less than 10 percent or so and there are so many groups operating, it is impossible for us to keep a check,\u201d said an official at the revenue intelligence department, who asked not to be identified as he is not authorised to speak to the media. \n \n Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said this month the measures had prompted a slight rise in smuggling, but his officers had said no one could bring in more than 5 kg. \n \n \u201cYou cannot carry more than 5 kg of gold and still go undetected,\u201d he told CNBC TV18. \n \n At Kolkata, Meena said investigators were questioning airline and airport staff. Profiles of passengers on the flight from Dubai were being checked. \n \n The revenue intelligence officer said a man had been arrested in an earlier case on suspicion of concealing 5 kg of gold in the toilet of an Air India plane in Dubai. He left the plane in Mumbai and another passenger removed the gold after it had flown on to Goa. \n \n Crews are now on alert for passengers lingering in the loo. \n \n \u201cWe are educating (our staff) about aircraft maps of how toilets are in an Airbus or a Boeing.

Shana Grice, 19, was found dead with her throat cut in her Brighton home in August last year, the Independent reports. In March, she had been charged with \"having caused wasteful employment of police by making a false report\" after she accused 27-year-old Michael Lane of assaulting her but failed to tell officers that they had an on-and-off relationship. A month before that report, she had complained to police that Lane was stalking her and left a note on her new boyfriend's car saying, \"Shana will always cheat on you.\" Lane is now on trial for the murder. The jury was told last week that the month before the killing, he received a caution from police after stealing a key and letting himself into Grice's home to watch her sleep, the BBC reports. A few days later, she told police that Lane was following her, but the incident was classed as \"low risk.\" Prosecutors say Lane was obsessed with Grice and became murderous after she decided to go back to another ex-boyfriend. He denies killing her, though he has admitted fitting a tracking device to her car. He told the court that he found her body after entering Grice's home through the open front door, then fled in panic and went home to shower instead of calling police.

(AP) \u2014 Decades-old DNA led to the arrests Tuesday of two men in connection with the shotgun slayings of two girls in California more than 40 years ago, authorities said. \n \n They arrested one suspect in Oklahoma and another in California after comparing their DNA with semen from both men found on one of the victims, 13-year-old Doris Karen Derryberry. \n \n She and 12-year-old Valerie Janice Lane, both of Olivehurst, California, were reported missing by their mothers on Nov. 12, 1973, after they failed to return from a shopping mall in nearby Linda that the girls had visited the previous day. \n \n A few hours later, the Yuba County Sheriff's Department was notified that the bodies of two girls had been found alongside a dirt road in a wooded area near Marysville, north of Sacramento, where they had been shot at close range with a shotgun, Sheriff Steve Durfor said. \n \n Arrested Tuesday were two 65-year-old cousins, Larry Don Patterson of Oakhurst, Oklahoma, and William Lloyd Harbour of Olivehurst, California. Both were age 22 at the time and living in Olivehurst, a small agricultural town in California's Central Valley. \n \n Durfor said both have since served prison sentences that resulted in their DNA being collected: Harbour for drug offenses in 1997 and 2003, and Patterson for a 1976 arrest on charges of raping two adult women in Chico, also in northern California. Patterson also had a 2006 arrest for failing to register as a sex offender, Durfor said. \n \n The families \"have endured decades of suffering and grief for not knowing who was responsible for the brutal murder of their loved ones,\" Durfor said.

(Yuba County Sheriff's Department... (Associated Press) \n \n MARYSVILLE, Calif. (AP) \u2014 An investigator \"with a bit of free time\" decided to send for testing DNA samples from a long-dormant cold case, which led authorities to arrest a pair of men linked to the 1973 shotgun slayings of two young girls, authorities said. \n \n Police in Oklahoma and California arrested the two 65-year-old suspects Tuesday morning for the murders of Valerie Janice Lane, 12, and Doris Karen Derryberry, 13. \n \n The seventh grade classmates told their mothers they were going to a mall shopping near their homes about 40 miles north of Sacramento on Nov. 12, 1973. Witnesses saw them in their neighborhood that night, but neither girl returned home. Both suspects were living in Olivehurst at that time, investigators said. \n \n Two boys were target shooting and found the girl's bodies about 20 hours later, according to news accounts at the time. Investigators say the girls were driven to a wooded area and shot at close range. \n \n Authorities then and now said a large-scale investigation was immediately launched and some 60 people interviewed over a three-year period before the case went cold for a lack of solid leads and was shelved in 1976. \n \n In March 2014, an investigator doing a routine look through cold cases decided to send semen samples found on Derryberry's body and preserved for 43 years to the state Department of Justice forensics lab for analysis. Seven months later, state DOJ technicians reported that the DNA in the semen matched the genetic profiles of cousins Larry Don Patterson and William Lloyd Harbour, who each committed serious enough crimes since 1973 to have their DNA samples collected and placed in law enforcement computer systems. \n \n \"Over time, anyone that's been assigned to our investigations unit for any length of time looks into some of the unsolved cases that we have,\" Yuba County Sheriff Steve Durfor said. \"And this was one in particular that one of our investigators had a bit of free time and really looked very closely at this case and identified that we should send some things off and see what it might yield for us.\" \n \n Durfor said both suspects served prison sentences. Patterson was arrested in 1976 for raping two women and again in 2006 for failing to register as a sex offender, Durfor said. Harbour had felony drug convictions, Durfor said. \n \n Patterson was arrested Tuesday morning in Oklahoma. Harbour was arrested after a traffic stop two hours later near his home in Olivehurst, where the two victims also lived. \n \n Durfor said the victims' families were told of the arrests Tuesday morning and have requested privacy. \n \n The families \"have endured decades of suffering and grief for not knowing who was responsible for the brutal murder of their loved ones,\" Durfor said. \n \n \"We're asking for the family to have time to process this news,\" said Stan Vantassle, Derryberry's nephew. \"We would like to have time to come to grips with this.\" \n \n Some of the family members are now elderly and \"have waited for something for 43 years for an answer as to what happened to their kids,\" Yuba County District Attorney Patrick McGrath said. \n \n \"Olivehurst, 43 years ago, was a very small community \u2014 still small,\" McGrath said of the town of about 14,000 people. Harbour lives near one of the victim's families, and \"inevitably there will be contact between various families and this is a situation we had to talk to them about. There will be a lot of frustration, there will be a lot of anger, a lot of things that we need to be concerned about.\" \n \n The twin slayings four decades ago shocked the small community and the nation, he said. \n \n \"Back in 1973, this simply didn't happen,\" he said. \"This was a big deal. Still is, obviously.\" \n \n The girls' slayings made headlines around the nation at a time when such killings seemed rare, McGrath said. Both men will face murder charges, he said. \n \n It took more time to reopen an investigation so old that several of the investigators and the pathologist who conducted the autopsy have since died, McGrath said.

The men were 22 at the time of the murders. \n \n According to the sheriff\u2019s department, 13-year-old Doris Karen Derryberry and Valerie Janice Lane, 12, were reported missing on Nov. 12, 1973, after failing to return from a shopping trip to Linda the day before. \n \n The bodies of the two friends were found hours later alongside a dirt road in a wooded area of nearby Wheatland. Derryberry had been sexually assaulted and both girls killed by shotgun blasts at close range. \n \n The case remained unsolved until March 2014, when investigators reviewing the case with improved forensic testing linked DNA evidence to Harbour and Patterson. \n \n The DNA hit prompted a lengthy new investigation which culminated in the arrest of the two men, who were expected to face murder charges, the sheriff\u2019s department said. \n \n Leslie Carbah, a spokeswoman for the Yuba County Sheriff\u2019s Department, said that investigators knew that Harbour was still living in the area but that it took them until Tuesday to find Patterson, with the help of U.S. Marshals. \n \n Patterson, who was convicted of rape in 1976, was also wanted for failing to register as a sex offender and was hiding from law enforcement for that reason, she said. \n \n \u201cIt took us basically until today to finally put eyes on Patterson,\u201d Carbah said. \u201cA lot of this was hinging on bringing them both into custody at the same time.

    "document": "Video (01:26) : A Minnesota doctor saw Prince twice in the month before his death - including the day before he died - and prescribed him medication, according to a search warrant. Authorities returned to Prince's estate outside Minneapolis on Tuesday. \n \n The identity of a Twin Cities doctor who had been treating Prince several weeks before he died was revealed in a search warrant filed in Hennepin County District Court. \n \n According to the warrant, Dr. Michael Todd Schulenberg, a family practitioner, had seen Prince twice before he was found in a Paisley Park elevator April 21. One visit occurred at the Chanhassen complex the day before Prince was found dead. \n \n The warrant authorized the search and seizure of Prince\u2019s medical records at North Memorial Medical Center in Robbinsdale. \n \n Late Tuesday afternoon, local and federal investigators returned to Paisley Park, where they continued their work for more than five hours. \n \n Schulenberg, 46, worked at North Memorial\u2019s Minnetonka clinic, said health system spokeswoman Lesa Bader. However, the doctor no longer works with the health system. Bader declined to provide employment dates or disclose why Schulenberg no longer works there. \n \n Carver County detective Chris Nelson said in a sworn statement used to obtain the warrant that Schulenberg had given a statement to deputies. Nelson wrote in the affidavit that Schulenberg told him that he had treated Prince on April 7 and on April 20. The doctor said he had arrived at Paisley Park the morning Prince was found in the elevator to deliver test results. The warrant does not describe the nature of the tests. It said that Schulenberg also told detectives that he had given Prince a prescription that was to be filled at a Walgreens. \n \n A law enforcement officer walked out of a door at Paisley Park on Tuesday. About a half-dozen unmarked cars were parked there as investigators returned to the complex. \n \n The musician was to have performed a pair of concerts in Atlanta on April 7, but postponed those shows, blaming the flu. \n \n A source with knowledge of the investigation told the Star Tribune on Friday that the doctor had been treating Prince for withdrawal symptoms from opioid addiction several weeks before his death. The source said the doctor did not prescribe opioids to the megastar. \n \n The warrant, filed May 6, accidentally was left unsealed until Tuesday, when Carver County learned of the mistake and sent a copy of the order sealing it to the Hennepin County court administrator. The Star Tribune obtained a copy. \n \n Schulenberg could not be reached for comment Tuesday. A review of his medical license shows no disciplinary action against the physician, who was trained at Oregon Health & Science University and who has board certification in family medicine. \n \n His attorney, Amy Conners, declined to comment Tuesday, citing the requirement that patient information be kept confidential. \n \n Prince reportedly was seeking treatment for addiction to painkillers in the weeks before his death. \n \n Representatives for the pop star reached out on April 20 to a California physician, Dr. Howard Kornfeld, who dispatched his son to meet with Prince the next day, along with another doctor who was federally certified to prescribe a medication, buprenorphine, which is used in the treatment of opioid addiction. \n \n Schulenberg is not on the list maintained by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of practitioners who can prescribe buprenorphine. The second Minnesota physician, who has not been publicly identified, had cleared his morning calendar to evaluate Prince on the day his body was found, the source said. The appointment never took place. \n \n The warrant also reveals that Kirk Anthony Johnson \u2014 a close associate of Prince\u2019s who manages Paisley Park \u2014 was present when detectives arrived at the death scene. The Star Tribune has reported that two staffers were present, along with Kornfeld\u2019s son, Andrew, when Prince\u2019s body was found. \n \n The affidavit says that detective Christina Wagner interviewed Johnson, who said that Prince had been treated in the Ridgeview health system for an undescribed illness in 2014 or 2015. \n \n Johnson could not be reached for comment. His attorney, F. Clayton Tyler, declined to comment Tuesday. \n \n Prescription data \n \n Meanwhile, investigators are looking into the means by which Prince received prescription opioids, which are narcotics subject to additional federal regulation. \n \n Prescriptions of opioids are reported to the Minnesota Board of Pharmacy as part of the state\u2019s monitoring of addicts who are obtaining the drugs from multiple practitioners. While these records can be obtained by law enforcement authorities under a search warrant, the board\u2019s executive director, Cody Wiberg, said Tuesday that his office has no such warrants in its possession. \n \n However, medical examiners can review the prescribing data without warrants on patients whose deaths they are investigating. So it is possible that the state opioid prescribing data has been consulted. \n \n The Midwest Medical Examiner\u2019s Office in Anoka is conducting the investigation to determine how Prince died. Results are pending.

(Associated Press) \n \n CHANHASSEN, Minn. (AP) \u2014 A Minnesota doctor saw Prince twice in the month before his death \u2014 including the day before he died \u2014 and prescribed him medication, according to contents of a search warrant that were revealed as authorities returned to the musician's suburban Minneapolis estate as part of their investigation into what killed him. \n \n Dr. Michael Todd Schulenberg treated Prince on April 7 and April 20, and he prescribed medications for the musician, according to the warrant, which was obtained Tuesday by at least two news outlets before authorities moved to ensure it was sealed. \n \n Investigators interviewed Schulenberg and searched a suburban Minneapolis hospital where he worked. The warrant did not specify what medications were prescribed or whether Prince took them. \n \n Schulenberg's attorney, Amy Conners, declined to comment late Tuesday, citing patient confidentiality. \n \n A law enforcement official has told The Associated Press that investigators are looking into whether Prince died from an overdose and whether a doctor was prescribing him drugs in the weeks before his death. The law enforcement official has been briefed on the investigation and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. \n \n Schulenberg is the second doctor whose name has surfaced in the investigation. Last week, a lawyer for California addiction specialist Dr. Howard Kornfeld told reporters that Prince's representatives had contacted Kornfeld seeking help a day before the superstar was found dead on April 21. \n \n On Tuesday, a sheriff's car and about a dozen unmarked vehicles entered the gates of Paisley Park. Asked what investigators were doing, Carver County Sheriff's Chief Deputy Jason Kamerud told the AP that they were \"being thorough.\" \n \n Kamerud declined to answer questions about the warrant that names Schulenberg, saying it was supposed to be sealed. Kamerud also said that after the contents were made public, he contacted a court administrator to ensure the warrant was sealed. \n \n The warrant was carried out last Thursday at North Memorial Medical Center in the Minneapolis suburb of Robbinsdale. \n \n Lesa Bader, a spokeswoman for North Memorial Medical Center, said Schulenberg was a primary care physician at its Minnetonka clinic but that he no longer works for the health care system. She declined to say why. No one answered the door at the doctor's home on Tuesday and phone messages left for him weren't returned. \n \n Schulenberg's April 7 treatment of Prince came the day he canceled shows in Atlanta citing illness. Prince played makeup shows April 14. During his return home on April 15, his plane made an emergency stop in Moline, Illinois. The law enforcement official who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity said Prince was found unconscious on the plane and that first responders gave him a shot of Narcan, which is used in suspected opioid overdoses. \n \n Schulenberg told a detective that he was dropping off some results of tests that had been performed on Prince when he came upon the death scene, according to the warrant. Schulenberg also told the detective that he had prescribed Prince \"medications\" with the prescription to be filled at a Walgreen's. \n \n The warrant sought \"any and all medical records, documents, reports, charts, photographs, prescriptions, doctor notes and medical images for Prince Rogers Nelson.\" \n \n The warrant also notes an interview with Kirk Anthony Johnson, a Paisley Park staff member and sometime drummer for Prince, who told another detective that Prince had visited the Highway 212 Medical Center not far from Paisley Park for \"an illness\" in 2014 or 2015. Johnson told the detective that Prince had been given fluids during the visit. \n \n Carver County previously released a log of 911 calls to Paisley Park that showed a 53-year-old man, apparently dehydrated, taken to Highway 212 Medical Center in 2013. That man's age was given as 53; Prince would have been 55 at the time. A hospital spokeswoman said earlier she couldn't provide any information on patients due to privacy laws. \n \n The people who found Prince dead included Kornfeld's son, Andrew Kornfeld, who had taken a redeye flight the night of April 20 but did not meet with Prince before his death. \n \n The Kornfelds' attorney, William Mauzy, said last week that Dr. Kornfeld sent his son because he could not immediately fly to Minnesota. Mauzy said Dr. Kornfeld arranged for Prince to be evaluated by a Minnesota physician on April 21. The attorney refused to identify the Minnesota doctor, and it's not clear whether the physician was Schulenberg. \n \n According to the Minnesota Board of Medical Practice website, Schulenberg has not been subjected to any disciplinary or corrective action in Minnesota or other states. He's a 1995 graduate of the Oregon Health Sciences University School of Medicine. His license status is listed as active. It expires Oct. 31 of this year. \n \n The site lists no self-reported criminal convictions. State law requires the board to post felonies and gross misdemeanors that happened after July 1, 2013, in any state. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Kevin Burbach, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass contributed to this report from Minneapolis.

A court document filed in connection with a search warrant for the star's medical records reveals that Prince saw local physician Dr. Michael Schulenberg on April 7 and on April 20, the New York Times reports. The day after the latter appointment, the doctor, who had prescribed medication for Prince and ordered tests, turned up at the star's Paisley Park compound to discover that his patient was already dead. Court documents state that Schulenberg gave Prince a prescription that was to be filled at a Walgreens, though it's not clear whether the singer ever did so, reports the Los Angeles Times. Schulenberg, 46, was employed at North Memorial Medical Center in a Minneapolis suburb at the time of Prince's death, but the health system now says he no longer works there, the Star Tribune reports. Prince's cause of death has yet to be established, but investigators suspect a prescription drug overdose is to blame, and they want to speak to an addiction specialist who sent his son to Prince's house on an overnight flight the day before he died. The search warrant for North Memorial sought \"all medical records, documents, reports, charts, photographs, prescriptions, doctor notes, and medical images for Prince Rogers Nelson,\" the AP notes.

Just a few hours earlier, the death toll had stood at four. \n \n Tod Gates, an incident commander, said that as he and other rescuers flew in a helicopter to the Darrington meeting, they spotted the four additional bodies. The dead were not identified Sunday night. \n \n In a news conference Monday morning, emergency officials said they were working off a \u201csoft list\u201d of 108 people who are unaccounted for, though they said the number of actual victims will likely be much lower. \n \n Darkness and shifting debris forced rescuers Saturday night to abandon efforts to reach voices coming from a buried structure. \n \n By Sunday, they heard no more voices. \n \n \u201cWe didn\u2019t see or hear any signs of life out there today,\u201d said Travis Hots, chief of Snohomish County Fire Districts 21 and 22, during a Sunday afternoon news conference. \n \n Casualties are likely to rise as the search continues through the wreckage that is all that remains of neighborhoods along the North Fork of the Stillaguamish River. In addition to destroying 30 or more homes, the slide buried a milelong stretch of Highway 530 under 20 feet or more of mud. \n \n Gov. Jay Inslee warned of grim days ahead during a news conference at Arlington City Hall. \u201cI have a sense we are going to have some hard news here,\u201d he said. \n \n The rain-soaked hillside that slid away Saturday morning was the same one that had partially collapsed in 2006. The area is about 16 miles east of Arlington. \n \n With no positive news forthcoming, relatives of the missing crowded into the Darrington Community Center looking for answers. \n \n Relatives handed photos of missing loved ones to rescue personnel in hopes they might turn up unconscious at a hospital. \n \n Those reportedly missing ranged from Oso-area homeowners to repairmen on work assignments and a group of girls at a slumber party. \n \n Ron Thompson, whose home was destroyed, stopped by the evacuation shelter at Post Middle School in Arlington to find out if his friends turned up alive. \u201cWe lost a lot of good kids. I don\u2019t know what else to tell you. It hurts,\u201d he said before driving away. \n \n A 4-month-old baby and her grandmother were also among the missing. \n \n The baby, Sanoah Huestis, lived with her grandparents, Christina and Seth Jefferds. Seth Jefferds, a volunteer firefighter, was not home at the time of the slide and arrived to find his house flattened and his wife and granddaughter missing, said his brother-in-law, Dale Petersen. \n \n \u201cHe said it was just like a bulldozer ran over the house,\u2019\u2019 Petersen said. \n \n Although the names of the people killed in the slide were not officially released, one is former Darrington librarian and School Board member Linda McPherson, 69, according to Pete Selvig, a member of the Darrington emergency-response team and a retired U.S. Forest Service employee. \n \n McPherson\u2019s husband, Gary \u201cMac\u201d McPherson, was also injured. His condition was not immediately known. \n \n The couple\u2019s house and that of their niece and nephew next door were both destroyed, Selvig said. The younger couple were not at home, but their dog was trapped in the debris, he said. \n \n Rescuers tried to get to the dog after hearing whimpering Saturday night, but had to give up because the mud and debris were moving, Selvig said. \n \n McPherson was branch manager of the Darrington library and served for about 15 years on the School Board, said Selvig, who served with her. \n \n He said her approach to the business and challenges of the small rural school district was professional and methodical. She was part of a Darrington contingent that lobbied the state Legislature for funding to rebuild the district\u2019s three aging schools. \u201cHer name is on the plaque on the new elementary,\u201d Selvig said. \n \n Seven people injured in the slide were being treated at area hospitals Sunday. \n \n At Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, a 6-month-old baby boy and an 81-year-old man were in critical condition in the intensive-care unit. A 37-year-old man and a 58-year-old man were in serious condition. A 25-year-old woman was in satisfactory condition. \n \n At Cascade Valley Hospital in Arlington, one woman was in satisfactory condition. Skagit Valley Hospital in Mount Vernon reported that a 68-year-old man was in stable condition. \n \n Witnesses described a frantic scene when the slide hit Saturday morning. \n \n Neighbors rushed to retrieve a mud-covered baby within moments, said an Arlington woman who was driving by when the catastrophe occurred. \n \n \u201cWe thought it was a car accident,\u201d said Sierra Sansaver, of Arlington, who said she was driving to Darrington to find the road was blocked by mud. \u201cThen you realize there\u2019s a house in the middle of the road.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe heard screaming from a house 100 yards from us. A whole bunch of men went in there and pulled out a 6-month-old baby,\u201d Sansaver said. Firefighters also were arriving, she said. \n \n \u201cThere was mud, household items everywhere, people screaming, crying, running into the rubbish.\u201d \n \n \u201cEverybody was covered in mud. A lady next door who saw what happened, she was giving them blankets to hold the baby in. They got in a car, and left,\u201d said Sansaver. \n \n The infant at Harborview matched that scenario. \n \n In Darrington, a search-and-rescue team of about 20 people was advised Sunday morning to mark dead bodies if they saw any and keep looking for survivors. \n \n Some workers emerged from the meeting bleary-eyed and dispirited. \n \n One volunteer firefighter who had stopped working around 11:30 p.m. Saturday night said many tragic stories have yet to be told. He watched one rescuer find his own front door, but nothing else \u2014 not his home, his wife or his child. \n \n They\u2019re in the \u201cmissing\u201d category along with many it is feared will eventually be listed as dead. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s much worse than everyone\u2019s been saying,\u201d said the firefighter, who did not want to be named. \u201cThe slide is about a mile wide. Entire neighborhoods are just gone. When the slide hit the river, it was like a tsunami.\u201d \n \n By noon on Sunday, the dammed-up Stillaguamish River was starting to break through a hole in the mile-wide mud wall near Oso, releasing some flow downstream. But officials said that was not a cause for alarm. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s not flowing at a rate that causes concern. There is water coming through. They don\u2019t feel it is going to be a catastrophic burst,\u201d said Shari Ireton, spokeswoman for the Snohomish County Sheriff\u2019s Office. \n \n Even if the water breaches the blockage, it is unlikely to cause major flooding downstream, said Brent Bower, a hydrologist with the National Weather Service. \n \n The forecast for the area near Oso looks dry for most of Monday, said Johnny Burg, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Seattle. Rain could return Monday night and into Tuesday, but Burg said \u201cwe\u2019re not forecasting anything heavy\u201d \u2014 maybe a tenth of an inch. \n \n Through March 19, Arlington had recorded 7.14 inches of rain for the month \u2014 just a couple inches short of the wettest March on record. A flash flood warning remained in effect. \n \n Inslee, who cut short a political trip to Montana to fly back to Washington state, thanked rescuers Sunday, and said he was awed by the destruction he witnessed after flying over the scene. \n \n \u201cThe devastation is just unrelenting and awesome. There is no stick standing in the path of the slide,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cBut there is another powerful force of nature, and that is empathy and compassion.\u201d \n \n Staff reporters Jim Brunner, Lynn Thompson and Nancy Bartley reported from Seattle. Staff reporters Mike Carter, Mike Lindblom, Mike Baker and Christine Clarridge reported from Arlington. Alexa Vaughn reported from Darrington.

(Associated Press) \n \n Search and rescue teams took to the air in helicopters and the ground on foot on Sunday looking for anyone who might still be alive. Their spirits had been raised late Saturday night when they heard voices calling for help from the flotsam of trees, dirt and wreckage. Dangerous conditions forced them to turn back in the darkness, but they resumed their work at first light Sunday. \n \n \"We didn't see or hear any signs of life out there today,\" Snohomish County Fire District 21 Chief Travis Hots said. \"It's very disappointing to all emergency responders on scene.\" \n \n Snohomish County sheriff's Lt. Rob Palmer said four more bodies were discovered late Sunday. Earlier in the day, authorities said one body had been found on the debris field. Three people were already confirmed dead on Saturday. \n \n More people remained missing, and authorities said the number was \"fluid.\" Earlier Sunday, they said it was at least 18, but that count came before additional bodies were discovered. \n \n The 1-square-mile slide also critically injured several people - including an infant - and destroyed about 30 homes. \n \n Crews were able to get to the soupy, tree-strewn area that was 15-feet deep in places Sunday after geologists flew over in a helicopter and determined it was safe enough for emergency responders and technical rescue personnel to search for possible survivors, Hots said \n \n He added that they did not search the entire debris field, only drier areas safe to traverse. Hots said crews were still in a \"search and rescue mode. It has not gone to a recovery mode at this time.\" \n \n Searchers planned to continue looking through the night. \n \n Before crews could get onto the debris field late Sunday morning, they looked for people by helicopter. They had late Saturday heard people yelling for help, but they were unable to reach anyone. The soupy mud was so thick and deep that searchers had to turn back. \n \n \"We have this huge square-mile mudflow that's basically like quicksand,\" Hots said Sunday. \n \n The slide wiped through what neighbors described as a former fishing village of small homes \u2014 some nearly 100 years old. \n \n As the search for the missing continued, authorities said some may have been able to get out on their own. The number unaccounted for could change because some people may have been in cars and on roads when the slide hit just before 11 a.m. Saturday. \n \n Officials described the mudslide as \"a big wall of mud and debris.\" It blocked about a mile of State Route 530 near the town of Oso, about 55 miles north of Seattle. It was reported to be about 15 feet deep in some areas. \n \n Authorities believe the slide was caused by ground made unstable by recent heavy rainfall. \n \n Washington Gov. Jay Inslee described the scene as \"a square mile of total devastation\" after flying over the disaster area midday Sunday.

John Kirby said. \n \n Later, a drone targeted an ISIS mortar position, Kirby said. When ISIS fighters returned to the site a short time later, the drone struck the target again, he said. \n \n That was followed a short time later by a second round of airstrikes, carried out by four U.S. fighter jets, that targeted an ISIS convoy of seven vehicles and another mortar position, Kirby said. \n \n The F/A 18s made two passes, dropping a total of eight laser-guided bombs, he said. \n \n Before the ISIS onslaught, the region had been the most stable in Iraq and a cooperative ally of the United States. U.S. military advisers and consular personnel are stationed in Irbil. \n \n At this point, the United States has hundreds of military personnel in Iraq, including advisers sent in recent weeks to coordinate with Iraqi and Kurdish military officials in response to the ISIS rampage. The USS George H.W. Bush and other Navy ships also are in the region, and the FA/18s in Friday's initial strike came from the aircraft carrier, officials said. \n \n Airstrikes are \"very important\" because ISIS fighters are well-armed and are outgunning the Kurdish forces, thanks to the weapons the militants seized from the Iraqi military in Mosul, Irbil Gov. Nawzad Hadi said. \n \n Even as the airstrikes were under way, there was news that ISIS militants captured Iraq's largest hydroelectric dam, just north of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. According to a senior Kurdish official, the militant fighters have been using U.S.-made weapons seized during fighting from the Iraqi army, including M1 Abrams tanks. \n \n There had been conflicting reports about who controlled the dam on the Tigris River, with heavy fighting under way between ISIS fighters and Kurdish forces, known as peshmerga. U.S. officials have warned that a failure of the dam would be catastrophic, resulting in flooding all the way to Baghdad. \n \n JUST WATCHED U.S.: No plan for boots on ground in Iraq Replay More Videos ...

The Yazidis are of Kurdish descent, and their religion is considered a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism. \n \n U.S. flights prohibited \n \n In other signs of a growing regional conflict: The Federal Aviation Administration issued a notice prohibiting U.S. airlines from flying through Iraqi airspace \"due to the hazardous situation created by the armed conflict.\" \n \n The developments showed that the lightning advance by ISIS fighters across northern Iraq this year has become a battle for the nation's future and overall stability in a part of the world wracked for decades by periodic war. \n \n U.S. warplanes patrolling the skies over northern Iraq have a \"green light\" to go after perceived ISIS threats to the Kurdish capital, Irbil, or to minority populations, said deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes. \n \n Airstrikes are also possible to help Kurdish forces end the siege by ISIS in the northern Iraqi mountains, where tens of thousands of Yazidis have sought refuge, Earnest, the White House spokesman, said Friday. \n \n ISIS fighters have surrounded the Yazidis on the ground below. \n \n \"If there can be American military might that can tip (the) balance, we'll look for an opportunity to do that,\" Earnest said. \n \n Kurdish pleas \n \n In announcing his airstrike decision Thursday night, Obama said the militants would get hit \"should they move towards the city.\" \n \n Kurdish leaders have been pleading for the United States or NATO to buttress their forces against ISIS from the air. The President seems to have heard their appeal. \n \n \"We do whatever is necessary to protect our people,\" Obama said, adding, \"We support our allies when they're in danger.\" \n \n Before Obama announced the airstrikes, two U.S. military cargo planes airdropped 5,300 gallons of water and 8,000 meals onto Mount Sinjar, where some Yazidi children had died from dehydration. \n \n U.S. F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet \n \n Photos: U.S. military's fighter fleet Photos: U.S. military's fighter fleet An F/A-18E Super Hornet from the Sunliners of Strike Fighter Squadron 81 taxis onto a catapult before launching from the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson.

The ministry's spokesman, Satar Nawrouz, said the drops came \"just in time.\" \n \n After seizing Iraq's second largest city Mosul in June, the Islamic State group advanced across the north, pushing back Kurdish forces and coming within 40 miles (60 kilometers) of Irbil. \n \n On Friday the Pentagon said U.S. fighter jets had dropped 500-pound bombs on a piece of artillery and a truck towing it after it fired near U.S. personnel outside the city. \n \n The extremist group's capture of a string of towns and villages in the north has sent minority communities fleeing for their lives. The Islamic state views Yazidis and Shiite Muslims as apostates, and has demanded Christians either convert to Islam or pay a special tax. \n \n Tens of thousands of Yazidis have been trapped in the mountains since the Islamic State overran Sinjar. The militants issued an ultimatum to the Yazidis, telling them they must convert to Islam, pay a religious tax, flee or face death. \n \n Faced with the threats, about 50,000 Yazidis \u2014 half of them children, according to U.N. figures \u2014 fled to the nearby mountains, where they were running out of food and water. \n \n An Iraqi military handout video posted online showed Iraqi troops in helicopters delivering aid to the area. The footage corresponds to AP reporting of events. \n \n Traveling in India, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said earlier Friday that if Islamic militants threaten U.S. interests in Iraq or the thousands of refugees in the mountains, the U.S. military has enough intelligence to clearly single out the attackers and launch effective airstrikes. \n \n He also told reporters that more than 60 of the 72 bundles of food and water airdropped onto the mountain reached the people stranded there. \n \n The rush of people expelled from their homes or fleeing violence has exacerbated Iraq's already-dire humanitarian crisis, with some 200,000 Iraqis joining the 1.5 million people already displaced from violence this year. \n \n A representative of Iraq's most influential Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, called for a more comprehensive international intervention to support the Iraqi government. \n \n \"The condemnation and consolation statements in support of the affected people, or sending some humanitarian aid, is not enough. Rather, solid plans, in cooperation with the Iraqi government, should be put in place to confront and eliminate the terrorists,\" said al-Sistani's spokesman Abdul-Mahdi al-Karbalaie in his Friday sermon in the holy city of Karbala. \n \n Obama's announcement on Thursday reflects the deepest American engagement in Iraq since U.S. troops withdrew in late 2011, after nearly a decade of war. \n \n The decision appears to have been driven by fears of an impending massacre of the tens of thousands who fled, as well as the longstanding U.S. ties with Iraq's Kurds, which go back to the first Gulf War in the 1990s. \n \n Washington has been more hesitant to intervene on behalf of the central government in Baghdad. Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has been widely blamed for the crisis, with critics accusing him of monopolizing power and pursuing a sectarian agenda that excluded Sunnis and Kurds. \n \n The Islamic State group, which has carved out a self-styled caliphate across wide swaths of Syria and Iraq, seized Iraq's largest hydroelectric dam on Thursday, taking control of enormous power and water resources and leverage over the Tigris River that runs through the heart of Baghdad. \n \n On Thursday the group said it has seized 17 Iraqi cities, towns and targets \u2014 including the dam and a military base \u2014 over the past five days, including Qaraqoush, the largest Christian village in Iraq. \n \n An Iraqi government official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to media, confirmed the takeover of the dam and described the situation as \"very dangerous.\" \n \n In Irbil, about 3,000 Christians who fled their homes in Qaraqoush huddled inside St. Joseph's cathedral. They said they were happy about the possibility of American airstrikes. \n \n \"We are pleased with the airstrikes and we hope we can go back to our properties,\" said one of the Qaraqoush refugees, 43-year-old Luay Janan. \n \n ___ \n \n Yacoub reported from Baghdad.

(AP Photo/Charles Dharapak) (Associated Press) \n \n Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said that two F/A-18 jets dropped 500-pound bombs on a piece of artillery and the truck towing it. Kirby said the fighters had taken off from the aircraft carrier USS George HW Bush in the Persian Gulf to conduct the mission. He said it wasn't clear how many militants might have been killed in the strike. \n \n The Pentagon said the militants were using the artillery to shell Kurdish forces defending Irbil. \n \n For the United States, it was a re-engagement in the long sectarian war from which American combat forces had been withdrawn \u2014 on President Barack Obama's orders \u2014 in late 2011. \n \n In a televised speech Thursday night, Obama threatened to renew U.S. military involvement. At the same time, he announced that U.S. military planes already had carried out airdrops of food and water, at the request of the Iraqi government, to tens of thousands of Iraqi religious minorities atop a mountain surrounded by militants and desperately in need of supplies. \n \n \"America is coming to help,\" Obama declared. \n \n Speaking to reporters while traveling in India Friday, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the U.S. military has sufficient intelligence resources and assets in place to launch strikes by both manned and unmanned aircraft in the region. \n \n Asked if the Islamic State group could successfully hide among civilians to evade strikes, Hagel said if the Islamic State moves against Irbil, Baghdad or the refugees trapped on a mountain, \"it's pretty clear who they are, and they would be pretty identifiable where our airstrikes could be effective.\" \n \n The Yazidis, who follow an ancient religion with ties to Zoroastrianism, fled their homes after the Islamic State group issued an ultimatum to convert to Islam, pay a religious fine, flee their homes or face death. \n \n \"Earlier this week, one Iraqi in the area cried to the world, 'There is no one coming to help.' Well, today, America is coming to help,\" Obama said. \"We're also consulting with other countries \u2014 and the United Nations \u2014 who have called for action to address this humanitarian crisis.\" \n \n The announcement reflected the deepest American engagement in Iraq since U.S. troops left. \n \n Obama, who made his remarks in a steady and somber tone, has staked much of his legacy as president on ending what he once called the \"dumb war\" in Iraq. \n \n Mindful of the public's aversion to another lengthy war, Obama acknowledged that the prospect of a new round of U.S. military action would be a cause for concern among many Americans. He vowed anew not to put American combat troops back on the ground in Iraq and said there was no U.S. military solution to the crisis. \n \n \"As commander in chief, I will not allow the United States to be dragged into fighting another war in Iraq,\" Obama said. \n \n Even so, he outlined a rationale for airstrikes in the event the Islamic State militants advanced on American troops in Irbil and the U.S. consulate there in the Kurdish region of Iraq. The troops were sent to Iraq earlier this year as part of the White House response to the extremist group's swift movement across the border with Syria and into Iraq. \n \n \"When the lives of American citizens are at risk, we will take action,\" Obama said. \"That's my responsibility as commander in chief.\" \n \n He said he had also authorized the use of targeted military strikes if necessary to help the Iraqi security forces protect civilians. \n \n The Pentagon said the airdrops were performed by one C-17 and two C-130 cargo aircraft that together delivered a total of 72 bundles of food and water. They were escorted by two F/A-18 fighters from an undisclosed air base in the region. \n \n The planes delivered 5,300 gallons of fresh drinking water and 8,000 pre-packaged meals and were over the drop area for less than 15 minutes at a low altitude. \n \n The president cast the mission to assist the Yazidis as part of the American mandate to assist around the world when the U.S. has the unique capabilities to help avert a massacre. \n \n In those cases, Obama said, \"we can act carefully and responsibly to prevent a potential act of genocide.\" \n \n Officials said the U.S. was prepared to undertake additional humanitarian airdrops if necessary, though they did not say how quickly those missions could occur. \n \n Administration officials had said earlier they believed unilateral U.S. strikes would be consistent with international law, in part because the Iraqi government has asked for Washington to take military action. They also said Obama had the constitutional authority to act on his own in order to protect American citizens. \n \n Obama had similarly authorized strikes in Syria last summer after chemical weapons were deployed, but those attacks were never carried out, in part because of domestic political concerns and also because an international agreement to strip Syria of its stockpiles of the deadly gases. \n \n The president has also faced persistent calls to take military action in Syria on humanitarian grounds, given that more than 170,000 people have been killed there. \n \n Critics, including some Republicans in Congress, have argued that Obama's cautious approach to Syria has allowed the Islamic State group to flourish there, growing strong enough to move across the border with Iraq and make swift gains. \n \n Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina praised Obama's proposed actions Thursday night but said much more will be necessary. \n \n \"This should include the provision of military and other assistance to our Kurdish, Iraqi and Syrian partners\" who are fighting the militants, airstrikes against the militants' leaders and forces and support for Sunni Iraqis who seek to resist the extremists, they said in a statement. \n \n In light of the militants' advances, Obama dispatched about 800 U.S. forces to Iraq earlier this year, with those troops largely split between joint operation centers in Baghdad and Irbil. \n \n More than half are providing security for the embassy and U.S. personnel. American service members also are involved in improving U.S. intelligence, providing security cooperation and conducting assessments of Iraqi capabilities. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Josh Lederman and Darlene Superville contributed to this report. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC and Robert Burns at http://twitter.com/RobertBurnsAP",

    "document": "In the next 60 seconds, people around the world will purchase one million plastic bottles and two million plastic bags. By the end of the year, we will produce enough bubble wrap to encircle the Equator 10 times. \n \n Though it will take more than 1,000 years for most of these items to degrade, many will soon break apart into tiny shards known as microplastics, trillions of which have been showing up in the oceans, fish, tap water and even table salt. \n \n Now, we can add one more microplastic repository to the list: the human gut. \n \n In a pilot study with a small sample size, researchers looked for microplastics in stool samples of eight people from Finland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, the United Kingdom and Austria. To their surprise, every single sample tested positive for the presence of a variety of microplastics. \n \n \u201cThis is the first study of its kind, so we did a pilot trial to see if there are any microplastics detectable at all,\u201d said Philipp Schwabl, a gastroenterologist at the Medical University of Vienna and lead author of the study. \u201cThe results were astonishing.\u201d ||||| Tiny particles of plastic are seemingly everywhere: So-called microplastics have been found in the ocean, tap water, bottled water and soil. Now, they've even been found in our poop. \n \n In a small, first-of-its-kind study, researchers have found microplastics in stool samples from people around the world. \n \n The study \"confirms what we have long suspected, that plastics ultimately reach the human gut,\" study lead author Dr. Philipp Schwabl, a physician scientist at the Medical University of Vienna's Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, said in a statement. \n \n Little is known about the health effects of microplastics, but there's concern that the pervasive plastics may affect our gastrointestinal (GI) health and possibly reach other organs. \"Now that we have first evidence for microplastics inside humans, we need further research to understand what this means for human health,\" Schwabl said. [9 Disgusting Things That the FDA Allows in Your Food] \n \n Schwabl presented his findings today (Oct. 22) at UEG Week in Vienna, a European gastroenterology meeting. The findings have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal. \n \n Microplastics are bits of plastic that measure under 0.2 inches (5 millimeters) in length \u2014 about the size of a sesame seed or smaller. They're formed when larger pieces of plastic pollution break down. Microplastics can wind up in the oceans or the Great Lakes, where the particles are ingested by aquatic life and enter the food chain. Indeed, microplastics have been detected in seafood, including tuna, lobster and shrimp, the researchers said. Humans are also likely exposed to microplastics as a result of plastic contamination from food packaging or processing. \n \n Still, data on human exposure to microplastics is scarce, and the new study is the first to quantify the particles in human stool, the researchers said. \n \n In the study, the researchers analyzed stool samples from eight healthy volunteers living in eight countries around the world: Finland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, the United Kingdom and Austria. \n \n Using a new type of analytical procedure, the researchers found microplastics in all of the stool samples they received. The most common types of plastic found were polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate \u2014 two plastics that have a wide range of uses, including plastic bottles. On average, the researchers detected 20 microplastic particles per 10 grams of stool. \n \n The participants were not told to eat any specific diet, but food diaries showed that six of the participants consumed fish in the week before giving a stool sample, and all of the participants consumed at least some plastic-wrapped foods or drank from plastic bottles. \n \n Although the study was small, the fact that microplastics were found in all of the samples \"indicates a high likelihood that also many other people involuntarily ingest microplastics,\" Schwabl told Live Science. \n \n The researchers are planning to conduct a larger study to confirm the findings, and to see if they can identify factors linked with microplastics in stool, such as a person's diet, lifestyle or where they live, Schwabl said. \n \n The researchers are also planning further studies to investigate the effects of microplastics on human health. Animal studies suggest that microplastics can enter the bloodstream and lymphatic system, and may reach the liver, Schwabl said. In addition, microplastics may cause damage to the intestines and affect how well the body absorbs nutrients, he said. \n \n Originally published on Live Science. ||||| Researchers monitored a group of participants from 8 countries across the world with results showing that every single stool sample tested positive for the presence of microplastic and up to 9 different plastic types were identified \n \n (Vienna, October 23, 2018) Microplastics have been found in the human food chain as particles made of polypropylene (PP), polyethylene-terephthalate (PET) and others were detected in human stools, research presented today at the 26th UEG Week in Vienna reveals. \n \n Researchers from the Medical University of Vienna and the Environment Agency Austria monitored a group of participants from countries across the world, including Finland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, the UK and Austria. The results show that every single stool sample tested positive for the presence of microplastic and up to nine different plastic types were identified. \n \n Microplastics are small particles of plastic less than 5mm and are used in various products for specific purposes; as well as being created unintentionally by the breaking down of larger pieces of plastic through weathering, degradation, wear and tear. Microplastic may impact human health via the GI tract where it could affect the tolerance and immune response of the gut by bioaccumulation or aiding transmission of toxic chemicals and pathogens. \n \n The pilot study was conducted with eight participants from across the globe. Each person kept a food diary in the week leading up to their stool sampling. The diaries showed that all participants were exposed to plastics by consuming plastic wrapped foods or drinking from plastic bottles. None of the participants were vegetarians and six of them consumed sea fish. \n \n The stools were tested at the Environment Agency Austria for 10 types of plastics following a newly developed analytical procedure. Up to nine different plastics, sized between 50 and 500 micrometres, were found, with polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) being the most common. On average, the researchers found 20 microplastic particles per 10g of stool. \n \n Lead researcher Dr. Philipp Schwabl, who is presenting the findings at the 26th UEG Week, commented: \"This is the first study of its kind and confirms what we have long suspected, that plastics ultimately reach the human gut. Of particular concern is what this means to us, and especially patients with gastrointestinal diseases. While the highest plastic concentrations in animal studies have been found in the gut, the smallest microplastic particles are capable of entering the blood stream, lymphatic system and may even reach the liver. Now that we have first evidence for microplastics inside humans, we need further research to understand what this means for human health.\" \n \n Global plastics production has increased substantially from the 1950s and continues to grow every year. For their many practical characteristics, plastics are pervasive in everyday life and humans are exposed to plastics in numerous ways. It is estimated that, through pollution, 2-5 % of all plastics produced end up in the seas. Once in the ocean, plastics are consumed by sea animals and enter the food chain where ultimately, they are likely to be consumed by humans. Significant amounts of microplastic have been detected in tuna, lobster and shrimp. Beyond that it is highly likely that during various steps of food processing or as a result of packaging food is being contaminated with plastics. \n \n ### \n \n Notes to Editors \n \n For further information, or to arrange an interview with Dr Philipp Schwabl, please contact Luke Paskins on +44 (0)1444 811099 or media@ueg.eu \n \n About Dr. Philipp Schwabl \n \n Dr. Philipp Schwabl is a researcher and physician scientist at the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at the Medical University of Vienna, in the research team of Prof. Dr. Thomas Reiberger, and presenting this study at the UEG Week Vienna 2018. \n \n About Dr. Bettina Liebmann \n \n Dr. Bettina Liebmann is a consultant on environmental analyses and respected expert on microplastics at the Environment Agency Austria.

All of their stool samples were found to contain microplastic particles. \n \n Up to nine different plastics were found out of 10 varieties tested for, in particles of sizes ranging from 50 to 500 micrometres. Polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate were the plastics most commonly found. \n \n On average, 20 particles of microplastic were found in each 10g of excreta. Microplastics are defined as particles of less than 5mm, with some created for use in products such as cosmetics but also by the breaking down of larger pieces of plastic, often in the sea. \n \n We are living on a plastic planet. What does it mean for our health? Read more \n \n Based on this study, the authors estimated that \u201cmore than 50% of the world population might have microplastics in their stools\u201d, though they stressed the need for larger-scale studies to confirm this. \n \n The Environment Agency Austria conducted the tests using a new procedure the researchers said shed fresh light on the extent of microplastics in the food chain. Samples from the eight subjects were sent to a laboratory in Vienna where they were analysed using a Fourier-transform infrared microspectrometer. \n \n Philipp Schwabl, a researcher at the Medical University of Vienna who led the study, said: \u201cThis is the first study of its kind and confirms what we have long suspected, that plastics ultimately reach the human gut. Of particular concern is what this means to us, and especially patients with gastrointestinal diseases.\u201d \n \n Previous studies on fish have also found plastics in the gut. Microplastics have been found in tap water around the world, in the oceans and in flying insects. A recent investigation in Italy also found microplastics present in soft drinks. In birds, the ingestion of plastic has been found to remodel the tiny fingerlike projections inside the small intestine, disrupt iron absorption and add to stress on the liver. \n \n \u201cThe smallest microplastic particles are capable of entering the bloodstream, the lymphatic system, and may even reach the liver,\u201d said Schwabl, who will report on the study at UEG Week in Vienna on Tuesday. \u201cNow that we have the first evidence for microplastics inside humans, we need further research to understand what this means for human health.\u201d \n \n Plastic particles in the gut could affect the digestive system\u2019s immune response or could aid the transmission of toxic chemicals and pathogens, the researchers said. \n \n The sources of the plastic found in the stool samples is unknown. The people studied kept a food diary that showed they were all exposed to plastics by consuming food wrapped in plastic or drinking from plastic bottles. None of those participating in the study were vegetarians, and six of the group ate sea fish. \n \n Scientists still know little about the effects of microplastics once they enter the human body, though many studies have already found them present in foods such as fish that people are likely to eat. The UK government has launched a study of health impacts. \n \n Plastic use is so pervasive in modern life that removing it entirely from the food chain would be extremely difficult. A million plastic bottles are bought around the world every minute and the number is expected to jump another 20% by 2021. \n \n Steps are being taken to stem the rising tide of plastic pollution, for instance by the banning of microbeads in some jurisdictions. The 8m tonnes of plastic dumped in the sea each year is also the target of increasing campaigns, by the UN and others, mainly because of the dangers it poses to sea life. Many fish and other marine creatures consume the plastics, sometimes confusing them for food. \n \n The authors of the new paper stressed the need to reduce plastic use, increase recycling and improve disposal where appropriate. \n \n Microplastics in our mussels: the sea is feeding human garbage back to us Read more \n \n Pressure for action is growing. Earlier this year the European parliament voted for an EU-wide ban on microplastics in cosmetics. The European commission has also proposed a ban on single-use plastic products such as cotton buds and plastic straws and urged member countries to put the onus of cleaning up waste on producers in an effort to clean up oceans. By 2025, European nations are supposed to collect 90% of single-use plastic drink bottles. \n \n Several nations have banned plastic bags completely, and a growing number of cities, including many in the US, are discussing moves to ban straws and other single-use items. \n \n Following this lead, the British government on Monday announced a consultation on proposals to ban plastic straws, drink stirrers and cotton buds, which can turn into microplastics as they break down. The ban is expected to come into force by October 2020. \n \n Critics, however, say such measures are late and inadequate to deal with a problem that has reached epic proportions.",

If this bill is sent to the president, he will veto it,\" said Bernadette Meehan, a spokeswoman for the White House's National Security Council. \n \n The United States and five other major powers are seeking to negotiate an agreement with Iran to curb its nuclear program in exchange for relief from economic sanctions. \n \n The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act would require to submit to Congress the text of any agreement within five days of concluding a final deal with Iran. The bill would also prohibit Obama from suspending or waiving sanctions on Iran passed by Congress for 60 days after a deal. \n \n Meehan said United States \"should give our negotiators the best chance of success, rather than complicating their efforts.\" \n \n Negotiations between the United States, Russia, China, France, Germany, Britain and Iran have reached a crucial stage, with a basic framework agreement due by the end of March. \n \n Republican Senator Bob Corker, one of the bipartisan group of sponsors of the bill, said it was \"disappointing that the president feels he is the only one who speaks for the citizens of our country.\" \n \n (Reporting By Julia Edwards and Timothy Gardner; Editing by Steve Orlofsky) ||||| WASHINGTON/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The United States and Israel showed signs of seeking to defuse tensions on Sunday ahead of a speech in Washington by Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu when he will warn against a possible nuclear deal with Iran. \n \n Policy differences over the negotiations with Iran remained firm, however, as Netanyahu set off for the United States to deliver the speech, which has imperiled ties between the two allies. \n \n Israel fears that U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s Iran diplomacy, with an end-of-March deadline for a framework accord, will allow its arch foe to develop atomic weapons \u2014 something Tehran denies seeking. \n \n By accepting an invitation from the Republican party to address Congress on Tuesday, the Israeli leader infuriated the Obama administration, which said it was not told of the speech before plans were made public in an apparent breach of protocol. \n \n U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry reiterated Washington\u2019s determination to pursue negotiations with Iran, saying on Sunday the United States deserved \u201cthe benefit of the doubt\u201d to see if a nuclear deal could be reached. \n \n Last week, Obama\u2019s national security adviser, Susan Rice, said the partisanship caused by Netanyahu\u2019s looming address was \u201cdestructive to the fabric of U.S.-Israeli ties\u201d. \n \n Asked about this on the ABC program \u201cThis Week\u201d, Kerry said \u201cthe prime minister of Israel is welcome to speak in the United States, obviously. And we have a closer relationship with Israel right now in terms of security than at any time in history.\u201d \n \n He said he had talked to Netanyahu on Saturday, adding, \u201cwe don\u2019t want to see this turned into some great political football.\u201d Israel and the United States agreed that the main goal was to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, he said. \n \n In remarks on Saturday at Jersualem\u2019s Western Wall, Netanyahu said: \u201cI would like to take this opportunity to say that I respect U.S. President Barack Obama.\u201d He added that he believed in the strong bilateral ties and said, \u201cthat strength will prevail over differences of opinion, those in the past and those yet to come.\u201d \n \n Netanyahu did not repeat those remarks as he departed on Sunday. The Israeli prime minister, who is running for re-election in a March 17 ballot, has framed his visit as being above politics and he portrayed himself as being a guardian for all Jews. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m going to Washington on a fateful, even historic, mission,\u201d he said as he boarded his plane in Tel Aviv. \u201cI feel that I am an emissary of all Israel\u2019s citizens, even those who do not agree with me, and of the entire Jewish people,\u201d he told reporters. \n \n Netanyahu is expected to use his speech to urge Congress to approve new sanctions against Iran despite Obama\u2019s pledge to veto such legislation because it would jeopardize nuclear talks. \n \n U.S. officials fear he is seeking to sabotage the Iran diplomacy, and critics have suggested his visit is an elaborate election stunt that will play well with voters back home. \n \n With Obama past the mid-point of his final term, his aides see an Iran nuclear deal as a potential signature achievement for a foreign policy legacy notably short on major successes. \n \n While White House and Israeli officials insist that key areas of cooperation, from counter-terrorism to intelligence to cyber security, will remain unaffected, the divide over the Iran talks has shaped up as the worst in decades. \n \n Previously Israel has always been careful to navigate between the Republican and Democratic camps. The planned address, however, has driven a rare wedge between Netanyahu\u2019s government and some congressional Democrats. Some two dozen or more of them plan to boycott the speech, according to unofficial estimates. \n \n IRANIAN ACCUSATION \n \n Speaking in Tehran on Saturday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif accused Netanyahu of trying to undermine the nuclear talks in order to distract from the Palestinians\u2019 unresolved bid for an independent state. \n \n \u201cNetanyahu is opposed to any sort of solution,\u201d Zarif said. \n \n Hard-line U.S. supporters of Israel say Netanyahu must take center-stage in Washington to sound the alarm over the potential Iran deal, even at the risk of offending long-time supporters. \n \n But a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the \u201cpoliticized\u201d nature of his visit threatened \u201cwhat undergirds the strength of the relationship\u201d. \n \n As one former U.S. official put it: \u201cSure, when Netanyahu calls the White House, Obama will answer. But how fast will he be about responding (to a crisis)?\u201d \n \n Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu listens as U.S. President Barack Obama (R) speaks, during their meeting in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington October 1, 2014. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque \n \n Last month, U.S. officials accused the Israeli government of leaking information to the Israeli media to undermine the Iran negotiations and said this would limit further sharing of sensitive details about the talks. \n \n \u201cWhat the prime minister is doing here is simply so egregious that it has a more lasting impact on that fundamental underlying relationship,\u201d said Jeremy Ben-Ami, head of J Street, a liberal pro-Israel lobbying group aligned with Obama\u2019s Iran policy. \n \n Netanyahu will address the influential pro-Israel lobby AIPAC on Monday. Even as he makes his hard-line case against Iran, he is expected to try to keep tensions from spiraling, mindful that Israelis are wary of becoming estranged from their superpower ally. ||||| VIENNA (Reuters) - The U.N. nuclear watchdog chief said on Monday Iran was being slow to cooperate with his agency\u2019s investigation into the Iranian atomic program and that the inquiry could not continue indefinitely. \n \n International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Yukiya Amano waits for the start of a board of governors meeting at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna March 2, 2015. REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader \n \n Diplomats have voiced doubt over whether the outstanding issues in the U.N. investigation would be resolved before a broader diplomatic agreement is reached between Iran and the United States, Britain, France, China, Russia and Germany. \n \n The seven countries have set a deadline of late March for a framework deal and June for a comprehensive final settlement that would curb Iran\u2019s nuclear activity to ensure it cannot be put to bombmaking in return for the lifting of international sanctions that have hammered the oil-based Iranian economy. \n \n When asked about a time frame for the U.N. inquiry running parallel to the higher-level negotiations, International Atomic Energy Agency chief Yukiya Amano said: \u201cIt depends on the level and pace of cooperation from Iran, I cannot tell by when... \n \n \u201cWe have asked questions and the questions are clear, so (Iran) can answer.\u201d \n \n The Islamic Republic has yet to address two outstanding issues relating to alleged explosives tests and other measures that might have been used for nuclear bomb research which it should have explained away by last August. \n \n The West fears Iran wants to develop atomic bomb capability. Tehran says its program is for peaceful nuclear energy only. \n \n The IAEA remains ready to accelerate the resolution of all outstanding issues, Amano added, but \u201cthis process cannot continue indefinitely\u201d. Iran\u2019s leading negotiator Abbas Araqchi met with Amano last week, promising swifter cooperation, but neither side has spelled out any details. \n \n Iran wants Western countries to swiftly lift crippling economic sanctions in any deal curbing its nuclear program - one of the sticking points in high-level negotiations continuing in Switzerland this week. \n \n The IAEA is likely to monitor the implementation of any deal between Iran and the six powers. Amano said he proposed a 1.8-percent increase to the body\u2019s 344-million-euro ($386 million) budget given increased demand for its services. \n \n He reiterated deep concern about the nuclear activities of North Korea, which quit the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1993. The IAEA has not had inspectors on the ground there since they were expelled by North Korea in 2009. \n \n ($1 = 0.8914 euros) ||||| Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel offered radically divergent approaches to the perils of a nuclear-armed Iran on Monday even as they tried to cool down the personal nature of a long-distance dispute that has inflamed relations between the United States and Israel for more than a month. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n On the eve of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s hotly debated address to Congress, the two leaders separately disclaimed personal animosity while laying out what amounts to the biggest policy schism between the two countries in years. Mr. Obama defended his diplomatic efforts to negotiate a deal with Iran while Mr. Netanyahu presented them as dangerously na\u00efve. \n \n \u201cI have a moral obligation to speak up in the face of these dangers while there is still time to avert them,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu told thousands of Israel supporters in Washington. \u201cFor 2,000 years, my people, the Jewish people, were stateless, defenseless, voiceless.\u201d He added: \u201cToday, we are no longer silent. Today, we have a voice. And tomorrow, as prime minister of the one and only Jewish state, I plan to use that voice\u201d \n \n Photo \n \n In an interview a few hours later, Mr. Obama said that he and Mr. Netanyahu had a \u201csubstantial disagreement\u201d over how to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. But he suggested that Mr. Netanyahu was an alarmist, saying that the Israeli leader had been unduly skeptical of a preliminary accord intended to slow the Iranian nuclear program during negotiations aimed at a longer-term resolution. \n \n \u201cNetanyahu made all sorts of claims \u2014 this was going to be a terrible deal, this was going to result in Iran getting $50 billion worth of relief, Iran would not abide by the agreement,\u201d Mr. Obama told the Reuters news agency. \u201cNone of that has come true.\u201d \n \n Mr. Obama said that any deal would have to ensure that Iran was not capable of building a nuclear weapon in less than a year, and that the agreement must stand for at least 10 years. \u201cIf they do agree to it,\u201d he said, \u201cit would be far more effective in controlling their nuclear program than any military action we could take, any military action Israel could take, and far more effective than sanctions will be.\u201d \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Continue reading the main story Video \n \n Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s trip to Washington, coming just two weeks before Israeli elections and three weeks before a deadline in the Iran talks, has polarized politicians in both countries. The prime minister\u2019s speech to a joint meeting of Congress on Tuesday \u2014 arranged by Speaker John A. Boehner without consulting the White House \u2014 immediately took on a partisan flavor, and Mr. Obama refused to meet with Mr. Netanyahu because his visit comes so close to the Israeli elections. \n \n Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and more than 50 Democratic lawmakers plan to skip Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s speech. While the White House has not publicly encouraged a boycott, it sent an email late Monday inviting House Democratic aides to a trade meeting at the White House on Tuesday at a time that would make it hard for them to attend the speech. Advocates on both sides have published incendiary newspaper ads in recent days, including one attacking Susan E. Rice, the president\u2019s national security adviser. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The president expressed grievance about the speaking invitation, which the White House has interpreted as a way of bashing Mr. Obama and undercutting the Iran talks. In the Reuters interview, Mr. Obama said it would be as if Democrats in Congress invited the French president to speak after opposing President George W. Bush\u2019s invasion of Iraq. \u201cI guarantee you that some of the same commentators who are cheerleading now would have suggested that it was the wrong thing to do,\u201d he said. \n \n Photo \n \n But the president and his team also seemed intent on tamping down the intensity of the dispute. Secretary of State John Kerry, in Geneva for more talks with Iran, made a point of defending Israel before the United Nations Human Rights Council on Monday. And Mr. Obama sent Ms. Rice and Samantha Power, his ambassador to the United Nations, to address the American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference in Washington. \n \n \u201cThis is not a personal issue,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cI think that it is important for every country in its relationship with the United States to recognize that the U.S. has a process of making policy.\u201d Even though Ms. Rice said last week that the issue could be \u201cdestructive\u201d to bipartisan support of Israel, Mr. Obama said Monday that it was a distraction and would not be \u201cpermanently destructive.\u201d \n \n Mr. Netanyahu, appearing before an estimated 16,000 supporters of Israel at the Aipac conference, characterized the disagreement over Iran as a \u201cfamily\u201d fight that would ultimately be overcome, and he expressed gratitude to Mr. Obama for his support of Israel over the years. \n \n \u201cMy speech is not intended to show any disrespect to President Obama or the esteemed office that he holds,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu told the crowd, which greeted him with standing ovations. \u201cI have great respect for both.\u201d \n \n He said he was sorry if anyone interpreted his visit as a political shot at Mr. Obama. \u201cThe last thing anyone who cares about Israel, the last thing that I would want, is for Israel to become a partisan issue,\u201d he said, \u201cand I regret that some people have misperceived my visit here this week as doing that. Israel has always been a bipartisan issue. Israel should always remain a bipartisan issue.\u201d \n \n But he emphasized that the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran looked different from Jerusalem than it does from Washington. \u201cAmerican leaders worry about the security of their country,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said. \u201cIsraeli leaders worry about the survival of their country.\u201d \n \n Photo \n \n Some supporters said they hoped Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s measured language might defuse some of the anger of recent weeks. \u201cI think he did well and lowered the temperature,\u201d said Abraham H. Foxman, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League, who had called on Mr. Netanyahu to cancel the speech because of the fallout. \u201cHe could have pepped them up. He did not. It was an important message.\u201d \n \n Opponents of Mr. Netanyahu said he had done lasting harm. \u201cI\u2019m here to do damage control,\u201d said Erel Margalit, a Labor member of Parliament who attended the Aipac conference. \u201cI\u2019m here to say we, too, are very concerned about Iran becoming a threshold nuclear state, but we\u2019re interested in getting the discussions back to where they were.\u201d \n \n Republicans maintained that it was Mr. Obama who had done the damage by making a fuss over a speech rather than paying attention to the substance of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s message. \u201cThe address is an opportunity for you to hear from the leader of one of our closest allies about the grave threats we face from radical Islam and Iran,\u201d Mr. Boehner\u2019s office said in an email. \n \n The tension of the moment was reflected at the Aipac conference before Ms. Power\u2019s speech, when the audience was advised to \u201ctreat all our speakers as guests in our home.\u201d Ms. Power and Ms. Rice both used their speeches to reaffirm Mr. Obama\u2019s support for Israel and his determination to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. \n \n But Ms. Rice encountered skepticism when she laid out the argument for a possible deal, with the audience applauding the goal of barring Iran from nuclear enrichment altogether even as she called that unrealistic. \u201cSound bites won\u2019t stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon,\u201d Ms. Rice said. \u201cStrong diplomacy backed by pressure can.\u201d ||||| An agreement on Iran\u2019s nuclear program would be a momentous event in American-Iranian relations, and one that White House officials insist is the best hope for constraining Tehran\u2019s nuclear ambitions and easing decades of animosity between Iran and the United States. But critics fear a deal will merely defer the day when Iran becomes a nuclear weapons state, while prompting Arab nations to consider developing their own nuclear deterrent. \n \n An accord could also be a major accomplishment for Mr. Kerry, 71, who has logged more than 309 travel days in the past two years, but whose major achievement to date is an agreement that required President Bashar al-Assad of Syria to give up his chemical arms \u2014 and left him ensconced in Damascus while the casualty toll from the conflict has continued to soar. Mr. Kerry\u2019s intensive pursuit of a Middle East peace agreement ended in bitter recriminations between Israeli and Palestinian leaders, and he has little to show for his push to end the civil war in Syria. \n \n In Ukraine, it is the Germans and French who have the lead: No American officials were present when a shaky cease-fire was reached in talks with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia last month, and which Russia-backed separatists ignored by taking the town of Debaltseve. \n \n Mr. Kerry\u2019s relationship with Mr. Zarif is not unique. Mr. Kerry has invested heavily in his relationships with other foreign figures, such as Mr. Netanyahu and Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, even when the payoff has not always been obvious. \n \n But Mr. Kerry clearly sees Mr. Zarif as a promising interlocutor at a time when conditions for a deal are better than they have been in years. Plummeting oil prices, economic sanctions and the Obama administration\u2019s willingness to allow Iran to retain a limited capability to enrich uranium have provided Tehran with an incentive to negotiate. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Mr. Kerry\u2019s diplomatic efforts with Mr. Zarif began at the United Nations in September 2013, when an introductory meeting scheduled for five minutes lasted for half an hour and ended with the diplomats exchanging email addresses and phone numbers. \n \n The relationship, however, has not always been harmonious. There were angry voices in a meeting in Muscat, Oman, last November, when the American side became frustrated by Mr. Zarif\u2019s reluctance \u2014 or inability, given his tight negotiating instructions \u2014 to make important concessions. When the two sides were unable to surmount their differences later that month in Vienna, Mr. Kerry proclaimed that they had been brainstorming about new ideas and would seek a framework agreement by the end of March. \n \n In recent months, the pace, intensity and stakes of the talks have increased. After Mr. Zarif was criticized by the Iranian lawmakers for his stroll with Mr. Kerry in Geneva, he appeared to be taking no chances when the two sides reconvened in Munich in February and photographers were not permitted to record the traditional handshake and greetings at the start of the session. \n \n In an apparent effort to demonstrate his toughness to his Iranian critics, Mr. Zarif also told Iran\u2019s state-controlled media that he had been instructed by Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to stop shouting at Mr. Kerry. \n \n At the last round of talks, however, the two sides appeared to get down to business. As that negotiating session approached, the Iranians informed the United States that Mr. Zarif would be accompanied in Geneva by Ali Akbar Salehi, the director of Iran\u2019s Atomic Energy Organization, who also served as foreign minister under Iran\u2019s former president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. That prompted the United States to include Ernest J. Moniz, the secretary of energy, in the talks. \n \n Mr. Salehi and Mr. Moniz are also expected to be at the Montreux negotiations with the two foreign ministers. \n \n In the meantime, Mr. Kerry\u2019s laserlike focus on getting an accord has unnerved Israel and prompted concerns in Saudi Arabia and other Arab foes of Tehran, anxieties Mr. Kerry is trying to quell even before an agreement has been forged. \n \n Mr. Kerry talked to Mr. Netanyahu by phone on Saturday, and discussed the Iran negotiations, the prime minister\u2019s visit to Washington and the United States\u2019 concern about the financial plight of the Palestinian Authority, even after criticizing him in public. (Mr. Kerry recently told Congress that the Israeli prime minister\u2019s support for the George W. Bush administration\u2019s effort to topple Saddam Hussein showed his judgment could not always been trusted. Mr. Kerry did not mention that he himself voted for a 2002 Senate resolution authorizing military action against Iraq if diplomatic efforts to eliminate its suspected weapons of mass destruction failed.) \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Mr. Kerry has also made plans to try to ease Arab anxieties about the potential accord with Iran. After leaving Montreux, Mr. Kerry plans to head to Riyadh to meet on Thursday with the new Saudi king, Salman. His next step will be London, where he will meet with foreign ministers from Arab nations in the Persian Gulf. \n \n A European diplomat whose country is participating in the negotiations with Iran questioned last week whether Mr. Kerry was too involved. \u201cYou want to bring in the secretary of state at the end, to resolve the last differences, as a closer,\u201d said the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the talks. \u201cHe should not be involved in the day-to-day technical negotiations.\u201d \n \n The Obama administration has sent Mr. Moniz and a team of experts to work on the technical issues with their Iranian counterparts in Montreux. But the next few weeks are expected to see a series of marathon meetings between the two foreign ministers, and with a deadline fast approaching, nobody is expecting Mr. Kerry to hold back now. ||||| Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu visits Jerusalem's holy Western Wall hours ahead of trip to Washington where he is expected to deliver controversial Congress speech on Iran. (Reuters) \n \n Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu visits Jerusalem's holy Western Wall hours ahead of trip to Washington where he is expected to deliver controversial Congress speech on Iran. (Reuters) \n \n Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s upcoming address to a joint meeting of Congress will probably be the most important speech of his career \u2014 and one that has already jeopardized relations between Israel and the United States. \n \n On Tuesday morning, Netanyahu will confront an American president and insist that the future of the State of Israel, and the world, is imperiled by a pending \u201cbad deal\u201d with Iran on its nuclear program. \n \n Also hanging in the balance is Netanyahu\u2019s own political future. Just two weeks after the speech, Netanyahu will either be reelected to a historic fourth term as prime minister or be out of a job. \n \n Netanyahu has spent three terms as Israeli prime minister focused on the dangers posed by Iran. In his first address to Congress in 1996, he warned that an atomic Iran would \u201cpresage catastrophic consequences, not only for my country, and not only for the Middle East, but for all mankind.\u201d \n \n His supporters call him prescient; his detractors say Netanyahu has been warning for 20 years that \u201ctime is running out\u201d on the Iran threat. His critics say Netanyahu is a broken record, a Cassandra obsessed, willing to deeply damage U.S.-Israeli relations in a futile confrontation with the United States that wins Israel nothing. \n \n His opponents in Israel and the United States say the speech is mostly a cynical ploy to get reelected in a tight March 17 vote, by fear-mongering on Iran and by opposing an American president who is not very popular in Israel. \n \n On Tuesday morning, as Secretary of State John F. Kerry meets with his counterparts in Switzerland to try to complete a framework accord with Iran by the end of March, Netanyahu will stand at the lectern in Congress to tell Americans, essentially, that President Obama is either foolhardy or weak and about to sign a deal with the devil. \n \n Netanyahu will warn, as he has in the past, that the Americans are gambling on a radical Iranian regime run by Muslim clerics who deny the Holocaust, sponsor terrorist groups, support a murderous regime in Syria and pledge to destroy Israel. \n \n As his chartered plane wings toward Washington on Sunday afternoon, Netanyahu\u2019s advisers say the final author of the speech will be Netanyahu himself. \n \n The prime minister\u2019s press office released photographs of Netanyahu penning his speech in longhand. \n \n Netanyahu will write the speech because he considers himself not only an authority on the minutiae of the Iran nuclear program \u2014 the number, type and productivity of the centrifuges and the estimates of low-enriched uranium to the kilogram \u2014 but also an expert on U.S. politics and the American people. \n \n Netanyahu studied at MIT and served as Israeli ambassador to the United Nations in New York. He has been called the \u201cmost American\u201d of Israeli prime ministers. \n \n This is his moment. Netanyahu\u2019s English is fluid, conversational, persuasive and often blunt. He has a flair for stagecraft. His guiding light, says his inner circle, is Britain\u2019s wartime premier and great orator, Winston Churchill, who is the only other foreign leader to have addressed a joint meeting of Congress three times. \n \n During Netanyahu\u2019s second speech to Congress in May 2009, he received 29 standing ovations. \n \n Netanyahu\u2019s critics in Israel and in the Obama administration warn that the Israeli leader is really no Churchill and that he has seriously miscalculated this time. \n \n Israeli relations with Democrats and the Obama administration are at a historic low. \n \n A top Israeli diplomat said that Netanyahu, if reelected, has already written off his relations with Obama in his last two years in the White House, a potentially perilous gambit for a Middle East leader surrounded by enemies. \n \n National security adviser Susan E. Rice on Tuesday denounced the upcoming address as \u201cdestructive\u201d to the relationship between the United States and Israel. \n \n A senior U.S. official said Friday that the strategy is to stand aside and let Netanyahu give his speech, which will neither derail Iran talks nor sway Congress to block a possible agreement. \n \n The senior official, who agreed to present administration views in exchange for anonymity, said the speech is more about Netanyahu\u2019s reelection bid and his preoccupation with Iran \u2014 a clear and present threat shared by the Obama White House, but approached in a more pragmatic manner. \n \n \u201cThe Netanyahu myth is that he alone understands the Americans,\u201d said Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli consul general in New York and former adviser to four Israeli foreign ministers. \n \n Pinkas said the speech will be applauded by Republicans but will do little to shape the Iran deal. \u201cHe is a grumpy, old man. He\u2019s like a Republican senator from West Jerusalem. He talks like them, he dresses like them. He is always saying, \ufffd?They\u2019re against me! They don\u2019t like me!\u2019 He\u2019s dealing with an America he doesn\u2019t know.\u201d Pinkas predicted the speech will fall flat. \n \n Israeli journalist and author of the best-selling history \u201cMy Promised Land,\u201d Ari Shavit, said he expects Netanyahu to give \u201ca brilliant and desperate speech.\u201d \n \n Shavit is sympathetic. He sees the Iranian threat as more \u201cbloodcurdling\u201d than ever. Yet he says the prime minister has made a mistake by working against the U.S. administration rather than beside it. \n \n Now \u201cIsrael rather than Iran has been isolated,\u201d Shavit wrote in a recent column . \n \n Netanyahu has opposed any deal with Iran that does not dismantle its uranium-enrichment program and insisted that economic sanctions should be stiffened, not lifted. Kerry and his negotiators have said such a deal is impossible. \n \n Senior administration officials say an imperfect agreement that freezes Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions and allows for monitoring leaves the world in a much safer place than a rogue Iran with the potential to rush toward a bomb in clandestine bunkers packed with centrifuges. \n \n Iran has long maintained that it seeks only a peaceful atom, and it is within its rights to research and exploit nuclear energy. \n \n Netanyahu does not believe this. The Israeli leader has brushed aside appeals by Jewish leaders in the United States, congressional Democrats and some of his allies at home to pull back and find a face-saving way to cancel the speech. \n \n In Israel, Netanyahu faces an extremely tight race for reelection against a surprisingly strong challenger, Isaac Herzog, leader of the Labor Party, who has pounded Netanyahu for endangering U.S.-Israeli relations with his speech. \n \n Two hundred former generals and commanders of the Israeli Defense Forces, Mossad intelligence agency, Shin Bet domestic security and National Police are scheduled to appear at a joint news conference Sunday to urge Netanyahu to avoid any further deterioration of the U.S.-Israeli strategic relationship. \n \n All this may help Netanyahu at home. \u201cThere will be nothing new in this speech,\u201d said Dan Avnon, a lecturer of political theory at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. \u201cThe question here is who will be able to replace him? Can anyone else stand up in Congress and talk so forcefully against the leader of the United States? This has an effect on voters in Israel. People sit at home and say this man really steps up to the pressure.\u201d \n \n \u201cWhat will happen after the speech? I honestly don\u2019t know,\u201d said Yuval Steinitz, Israeli minister of intelligence and strategic affairs, a Netanyahu confidant and the Israeli government\u2019s top authority on the nuclear talks. \n \n \u201cIt will be very clear this is a historic speech,\u201d Steinitz said. \u201cBecause this issue is burning in his bones. He really feels that as prime minister of Israel this is his first priority, above all other issues.\u201d \n \n Netanyahu\u2019s speech is going to be especially challenging, as it must reach multiple audiences with multiple messages. \n \n \u201cHe is speaking to the people of Israel, his political system, to the administration, to Congress and to the American people, as well,\u201d said Dore Gold, president of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs and a former foreign policy adviser to the prime minister who is still part of his inner circle. \n \n \u201cI think the notion that this speech is for political purposes is baseless,\u201d said Gold, a former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations. \n \n Netanyahu has reveled on the grand stages afforded him in past performances at the United Nations and before Congress. In a September 2012 address before the U.N. General Assembly, Netanyahu employed a kind of Wile E. Coyote drawing of a bomb with a fuse and took out a marker to draw a literal red line. \n \n Netanyahu\u2019s intelligence minister said he has not seen a draft of the speech, but he said the prime minister will stress that leaving Iran with thousands of centrifuges and a stockpile of uranium \u2014 materials that Israelis say would allow Iran to break through to a nuclear bomb in months, not years \u2014 is too dangerous. \n \n \u201cOur position is simple,\u201d Steinitz said. \u201cIran built a nuclear program in secret, illegally. They want normal relations with the world? Okay, dismantle it.\u201d \n \n Ruth Eglash and Anne Gearan contributed to this report.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Over the next two days, Washington will be a study in contrasts. Today, President Obama and two key advisers will push for a diplomatic means of avoiding a nuclear Iran; tomorrow, in a controversial speech to Congress, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will push back against the plan, the New York Times reports. To set the scene: Netanyahu left Tel Aviv yesterday for what he called \"a fateful, even historic, mission\" for which he is \"an emissary of all Israel's citizens, even those who do not agree with me, and of the entire Jewish people,\" Reuters reports. His speech will likely call for boosted sanctions against Iran, but Obama has suggested he would veto any bill giving Congress a chance to legislate on the matter. This weekend, Netanyahu offered conciliatory words, saying he \"respected\" Obama and that \"strength will prevail over differences of opinion.\" Obama will meet Reuters for an interview this afternoon, while National Security Adviser Susan Rice and UN Ambassador Samantha Power speak to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a group Netanyahu will also address, the Times reports. The paper sees the meetings as a chance for the administration to reaffirm its support for Israel. Indeed, John Kerry yesterday noted on ABC's This Week that Netanyahu \"is welcome to speak in the United States, obviously. And we have a closer relationship with Israel right now in terms of security than at any time in history,\" Reuters reports. Kerry tomorrow will join international officials in Switzerland as they look to outline an Iranian deal by the month's end, the Washington Post reports. Kerry has been working closely\u2014too closely, according to some Iranian lawmakers\u2014with Iran's foreign minister to hammer out a deal, the Times reports. \"He has made a huge investment of his time and energy in the talks, and his personal, hands-on involvement in recent months has been crucial to building momentum toward a deal,\" says an analyst. But some worry that Iran could read Kerry's \"eagerness\" as an opening to seek more concessions. Meanwhile, the UN's nuclear agency says Iran is coming up short on providing essential information, Reuters reports. \"The (IAEA) is not in a position to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran, and therefore to conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is in peaceful activities,\" the agency's chief says.",
    "generated_summary": "U.S. President Barack Obama would veto a bill allowing Congress to weigh in on any deal the United States and other negotiating countries reach with Iran on its nuclear capabilities. \"The president has been clear that now is not the time for Congress to pass additional legislation on Iran,\" a White House spokeswoman said. The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act would require to submit to Congress the text of any agreement within five days of concluding a final deal with Iran. The bill would also prohibit Obama from suspending or waiving sanctions on Iran passed by Congress for 60 days after a deal. The United States, five other major powers are seeking to negotiate an agreement with Iran to curb its nuclear program.",

Other documents sought by the committee, from after Jan. 20, involve sensitive information, he said. \n \n \"It is unclear how such documents would be relevant to the stated purpose of the committee's review, which according to your letter is to examine Lt. Gen. Flynn's disclosure of payments related to activities that occurred in 2015 and 2016, prior to his service in the White House,\" Short wrote in a letter dated April 19 that was sent to committee leaders. \n \n ADVERTISEMENT \n \n In March, the committee sent a letter to the White House, the Defense Department and several other administration heads asking for a range of records related to the payments received by Flynn, who also worked on Trump\u2019s campaign and the presidential transition. \n \n On Tuesday morning, the committee reviewed a batch of documents responsive to the request from the Pentagon behind closed doors. \n \n Those documents, said both chairman Jason Chaffetz Jason ChaffetzTucker Carlson: Ruling class cares more about foreigners than their own people Fox's Kennedy chides Chaffetz on child migrants: 'I\u2019m sure these mini rapists all have bombs strapped to their chests' After FBI cleared by IG report, GOP must reform itself MORE (R-Utah) and ranking member Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), suggest that Flynn broke the law by declining to disclose the payments from both Russia and Turkey in his application to renew his security clearance. \n \n \"Personally, I see no data to supper the notion that Gen. Flynn complied with the law,\" Chaffetz said. \n \n But both Chaffetz and Cummings stopped short of accusing the White House of obstructing their investigation. \n \n \"I wouldn't call it obstruction,\" Cummings said. \n \n Flynn had also declined to disclose the payments in his original financial disclosure forms submitted in February. \n \n He filed an amended disclosure last month reporting payments for speeches from three Russian-linked companies, including RT, but the move has remained under scrutiny amidst the FBI\u2019s ongoing investigation into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia during the election. \n \n According to Cummings, Flynn applied to renew his security clearance \u2014 using a form called a SF-86 \u2014 in January of 2016, just month after he traveled to Moscow to give a paid speech. During a dinner at that appearance, he was seated with Russian President Vladimir Putin. \n \n There is \"no evidence in the documents that he reported funds he received for his trip\" and \"no evidence he sought permission to obtain these funds from a foreign source,\" Cummings said Tuesday, noting that knowingly falsifying or concealing a material fact in an SF-86 is a felony. \n \n Flynn was forced to resign in February after it came to light that he had misled Vice President Pence and the public about the content of a phone call with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyac. \n \n The former intelligence official has offered to testify before the Senate and House Intelligence committees \u2014 which are both investigating Russian interference in the election \u2014 in exchange for immunity, but neither committee has accepted the offer. \n \n Chaffetz said Tuesday that Flynn could potentially be on the hook for tens of thousands of dollars in remittance to the U.S. government. \n \n But the authority to levy that penalty would rest with the administration \u2014 not with the committee. \n \n Although Cummings said that he would like to see Flynn appear before the committee, such a hearing appears unlikely. Chaffetz argued that the \"lead\" in any Russia-related investigations is the Intelligence Committee. Oversight, he said, is in \"more of a support role.\" \n \n \"I highly doubt\" the committee will call Flynn to testify, Chaffetz said. \n \n This story was updated at 11:56 a.m. ||||| The lead Democrat and Republican on the House Oversight Committee meted out a rare bipartisan rebuke of former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn on Tuesday after seeing private information that confirmed the former administration official failed to disclose foreign income from Russia and Turkey. \n \n [Flynn did not initially reveal income from Russia-related entities] \n \n The public criticism by the senior Republican on the House\u2019s chief investigative panel is unusual and presents a dilemma for the White House, which was accused of failing to provide everything the committee asked for \u2014 an assertion White House press secretary Sean Spicer disputed. \n \n Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) and the panel\u2019s ranking Democrat, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), suggested that Flynn broke the law. Flynn was ousted in February after misleading Vice President Pence about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. \n \n The lawmakers said they believe Flynn neither received permission nor fully disclosed income he earned for a speaking engagement in Russia and lobbying activities on behalf of Turkey. They reached the conclusion after viewing two classified memos and a disclosure form in a private briefing Tuesday morning. \n \n (Adriana Usero/The Washington Post) \n \n \u201cPersonally I see no evidence or no data to support the notion that General Flynn complied with the law,\u201d Chaffetz told reporters after the briefing. \n \n Added Cummings: \u201cHe was supposed to get permission, he was supposed to report it, and he didn\u2019t. This is a major problem.\u201d \n \n The bipartisan criticism of Flynn is a striking departure from the partisan discord that has defined recent Oversight Committee investigations. Democrats have often complained of being shut out of major decisions in high-profile investigations such as the Benghazi probe. \n \n It comes as the House and Senate intelligence committees move into a new phase of their investigations into Russia\u2019s alleged interference in the 2016 election, including alleged ties between campaign aides and Russian officials. The FBI is also investigating Russia\u2019s suspected interference in the elections and ties to the Trump campaign. \n \n After a rocky start, the House Intelligence Committee is gaining steam with a new head of the Russia investigation. Rep. K. Michael Conaway (R-Tex.) \u2014 who stepped in after the committee\u2019s chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), recused himself \u2014 has scheduled a classified briefing next Tuesday with the directors of the FBI and National Security Agency. He has invited former CIA director John Brennan, former director of national intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. and former acting attorney general Sally Yates to testify in an open hearing. \n \n The Senate is also taking action. Yates and Clapper are scheduled to testify before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on May 8. \n \n Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said Tuesday that his panel had \u201cfinished the initial round\u201d of over 20 interviews and planned to \u201cpick that pace up\u201d with more in the near future. \n \n (Reuters) \n \n Flynn is on the list of officials Burr hopes to bring in for an interview. The senator noted the panel had been interested in speaking to him \u201cfrom the beginning.\u201d \n \n \u201cIn many cases in investigations like this, you get one shot at people,\u201d Burr said, explaining why they had not yet invited him. \u201cSo we want to make sure we\u2019re as thorough as we possibly can be.\u201d \n \n Chaffetz and Cummings stressed Tuesday that as a former military officer, Flynn would have needed special permission for his December 2015 appearance at a gala sponsored by RT, the Russian-government-funded television station, for which he was paid $45,000. For his work lobbying on behalf of the Turkish government, he was paid more than $500,000. \n \n \u201cIt does not appear that was ever sought, nor did he get that permission,\u201d Chaffetz said. \n \n The Republican later added that while Flynn was clearly not in compliance with the law, \u201cit would be a little strong to say that he flat-out lied.\u201d \n \n Democrats immediately pounced on the news, claiming that it was yet another drip of damaging information implicating the Trump world\u2019s relationship with Russia. \n \n \u201cThe disturbing news that General Flynn may have violated the law in connection with his security clearance may be just the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Tuesday. \u201cThese revelations highlight the importance of the intelligence committee working in a bipartisan way to request and receive documents with respect to any financial arrangements Flynn and others in similar positions may have had with foreign governments,\u201d he said. \n \n According to the New York Times, Flynn isn\u2019t the only member of Trump\u2019s team who left his contacts with foreign officials off his official security-clearance application \u2014 Jared Kushner left his meetings with Russian officials off the same form. \n \n Chaffetz and Cummings stressed that Flynn\u2019s omission could cost him. Violations of this nature can be punished by up to five years of jail time. The FBI could open an investigation into the matter, and if it has not already, Congress could ask them to do so. \n \n Those decisions will probably be up to the Justice Department\u2019s new deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, whom the Senate confirmed Tuesday by a vote of 94 to 6. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from matters involving the Trump campaign. \n \n The bar for prosecution is high. The law requires investigators to show that Flynn \u201cknowingly and willfully\u201d made false statements. Prosecutors would not be able to make a case if Flynn\u2019s forms were inaccurate because of carelessness or an honest mistake. \n \n Chaffetz stressed that the government should \u201crecover the money\u201d paid to Flynn by foreign entities, a figure that would at least be in the tens of thousands of dollars. But Chaffetz announced last week that he would resign from Congress in 2018 and perhaps leave much sooner \u2014 setting off a scramble to replace him. On Tuesday, Chaffetz also said the House Intelligence Committee would be the panel to compel any testimony from Flynn. \n \n Spicer would not say in his Tuesday briefing whether Flynn may have broken the law. \n \n \u201cThat would be a question for him and the law enforcement agency. I don\u2019t know what he filled out or what he did or didn\u2019t do,\u201d Spicer told reporters. \u201cHe filled that form out before coming here, so it would be up to the committee and other authorities to look at that.\u201d \n \n He insisted the Trump administration had provided all the documents Congress requested. \n \n \u201cEvery document they asked for it\u2019s my understanding they\u2019ve gotten,\u201d he said. \n \n The Oversight Committee asked the White House in March for documents pertaining to Flynn\u2019s security-clearance applications, the vetting that occurred before he was named national security adviser, and all of his contacts with foreign agents, including any payments received. In particular, the committee heads requested to see a disclosure form known as the SF86, on which Flynn was obligated to declare any foreign income. \n \n On April 19, the White House sent the committee a reply, stating that any documents related to Flynn from before Jan. 20 \u2014 the day Trump took office \u2014 were not in its possession and that any documents from after that date did not seem relevant to the investigation. \n \n Spicer added Tuesday that records requests for Flynn\u2019s conversations with foreign contacts were \u201cunwieldy,\u201d arguing it was Flynn\u2019s job \u201cto talk with foreign counterparts on a daily basis.\u201d \n \n \u201cTo document every call that he may have made is not exactly a request that is able to be filled,\u201d he said. \n \n [Oversight Committee jockeying heats up in wake of Chaffetz announcement] \n \n Flynn counsel Rob Kelner of Covington & Burling said his client has spoken extensively with the government about the matter. \u201cAs has previously been reported, General Flynn briefed the Defense Intelligence Agency, a component agency of DoD, extensively regarding the RT speaking event trip both before and after the trip, and he answered any questions that were posed by DIA concerning the trip during those briefings,\u201d Kelner said in a statement. \n \n [Here\u2019s what we know about Trump\u2019s ties to Russian interests] \n \n The documents that committee members reviewed Tuesday came from the Defense Intelligence Agency and showed that Flynn had not declared any income from Russian or Turkish sources, committee leaders said. \n \n Kelner also noted that lawmakers might be interested in seeing documents that could shed light on what Flynn told the White House and his foreign contacts before he was named national security adviser, and what led to his exit less than a month later. During the transition period, Flynn told the incoming White House that he might need to register as a foreign agent. \n \n David Nakamura and Matt Zapotosky contributed to this report. \n \n Read more at PowerPost ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Latest on the congressional probe of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election (all times local): \n \n 11:20 a.m. \n \n The senior members of Congress on the House Oversight Committee says classified military documents show that the Trump administration's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, did not ask permission or inform the U.S. government about payments he received for appearances before Russian organizations in 2015 and for lobbying that helped Turkey's government. \n \n Flynn's failure to obtain permission from military authorities for the payments raises concern whether Flynn violated a constitutional ban on foreign payments to retired military officers.

Flynn, President Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, may have violated federal law by not fully disclosing his business dealings with Russia when seeking a security clearance to work in the White House, top House oversight lawmakers from both parties asserted on Tuesday. \n \n The revelation came after Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah and chairman of the House oversight committee, and other lawmakers on the panel examined classified documents related to Mr. Flynn, including a form he filled out in January 2016 to receive his security clearance. The form is known as an SF-86 and is required by anyone in the government who handles classified information. \n \n As part of the review, Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the committee\u2019s senior Democrat, said Mr. Flynn did not disclose in those documents payments totaling more than $45,000 that he received from the Russian government for giving a speech in Moscow in 2015, among others. \n \n The development is the latest trouble for Mr. Flynn, who also did not disclose payments from Russian-linked entities on a financial disclosure form that the Trump administration released in late March. Earlier in March, Mr. Flynn filed papers acknowledging that he worked as a foreign agent last year representing the interests of the Turkish government, causing another uproar and more unfavorable headlines for the Trump administration.",

    "document": "Known for his films, charges against him of statutory rape, and for his wife's murder by Charles Manson, Roman Polanski is a complex and controversial figure. \n \n Who Is Roman Polanski? Born Raimund Polanski, on August 18, 1933, in Paris, director Roman Polanski moved to Hollywood in 1968, making his American film debut with the classic Rosemary's Baby. In 1969, Polanski's pregnant wife, actress Sharon Tate, was brutally murdered by members of the Charles Manson cult, and in 1977 Polanski was indicted on six criminal counts for having sexual relations with a minor. \n \n Early Life in Europe Director, actor. Born Raimund Polanski, on August 18, 1933, in Paris, France. At the age of three, Polanski moved with his family to his father's native city of Krakow, Poland. In 1941, his parents were imprisoned in various Nazi concentration camps, where his mother eventually died in Auschwitz. In order to escape deportation, Polanski lived with several different Polish families until he was reunited with his father in 1944. ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website As a teenager, Polanski developed his acting skills in radio dramas and films. In 1954, he enrolled at the Polish National Film Academy in Lodz, where his body of work consisted of short films and documentaries. Upon his graduation, he appeared in a number of movies'many of which were the work of famed Polish director Andrzej Wajda, including Lotna (1959), Innocent Sorcerers (1960), and Samson (1961). In 1962, he directed his first feature-length film, Knife in the Water . The international recognition that followed, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Film, gave Polanski the chance to bring his movies to a more mainstream audience. The following year, he moved to London, where his next offering, the psychological thriller Repulsion (1965), was considered equally compelling by critics and audiences. ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website \n \n Wife Sharon Tate's Murder In 1968, Polanski moved to Hollywood, making his American film debut with the classic thriller Rosemary's Baby, which featured exceptional performances by Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes. Despite his burgeoning film career, Polanski endured a devastating tragedy the following year when his pregnant wife, actress Sharon Tate, was brutally murdered by members of the Charles Manson cult. The extreme violence experienced by Polanski throughout his life was often reflected in his films, which tended to focus on the darker themes of alienation and evil-most notably, in the modern film noir Chinatown (1974), featuring John Huston, Jack Nicholson, and Faye Dunaway. \n \n Sexual Abuse Case In 1977, Polanski was indicted on six criminal counts for having sexual relations with a minor. The alleged act took place with a 13-year-old girl, in the home of the actor Jack Nicholson. Both Nicholson and his longtime girlfriend, actress Anjelica Huston, testified against Polanski when the highly publicized case was brought to trial. Polanski pleaded guilty to one charge of unlawful sexual intercourse and underwent six weeks of psychiatric evaluation at a state prison in California. Although additional criminal charges were still pending, Polanski fled the United States after his discharge. While authorities were not actively seeking him out, he continued to face the possibility of prison if he returned to America. In May 2018, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences expelled director due to their new ethical standards based on the #MeToo movement. \n \n Return to Filmmaking Polanski traveled to Europe and eventually settled in Paris, where he directed the critically acclaimed film Tess (1979)\u2014an adaptation of Thomas Hardy's novel Tess of the d'Urbervilles. Throughout the 1980s, he concentrated on stage acting, appearing in productions of Amadeus (1981) and Metamorphosis (1988). Polanski returned to film work with the intense thriller Frantic (1988), starring Harrison Ford and Betty Buckley, followed by the erotic drama Bitter Moon (1992), with Hugh Grant and Polanski's current wife Emmanuelle Seigner. Both projects failed to impress critics, but Polanski reestablished himself in 1994 with Death and the Maiden, a film adaptation of Ariel Dorfman's play. In 1999, Polanski directed the supernatural thriller The Ninth Gate, which starred Johnny Depp. The film's critical and commercial reception was tepid. ||||| Exiled director Roman Polanski is making a new push to finally put to rest his decades-old child rape case \u2014 and return to the United States, his lawyer told The Post on Thursday. \n \n The \u201cChinatown\u201d director\u2019s attorney, Harland Braun, has requested that a Los Angeles judge unseal secret testimony that allegedly proves Polanski\u2019s longtime contention that the judge in the 1977 case reneged on a deal for him to spend 42 days at Chino State Prison in Chino, Calif. \n \n Polanski completed the stint in the lockup and underwent psychiatric evaluation \u2014 and Braun now wants the court to honor the plea deal defense attorneys struck with the original LA prosecutor in the case, retired Deputy District Attorney Roger Gunson. \n \n \u201cI believe there is no current excuse or justification for keeping DDA Roger Gunson\u2019s sworn testimony under seal,\u201d Braun wrote to Judge Scott Gordon in a February 6, 2017, letter obtained by The Post. \n \n \u201cThe truth is that the sealing of the Gunson statement makes it appear that someone fears its contents.\u201d \n \n The 83-year-old Polanski was accused of drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl at the home of actor Jack Nicholson on March 10, 1977. Polanski had lured her there on the pretext of photographing her for French Vogue. \n \n The late Judge Laurence Rittenband initially signed off on the plea deal, but had a sudden change of heart and ordered Polanski to spend up to 50 years behind bars. \n \n Polanski fled the United States and has lived in Paris, France, ever since as a fugitive. \n \n In 2009, Polanski was captured while traveling through Zurich, Switzerland. He was jailed for over 300 days as US authorities tried unsuccessfully to extradite him. \n \n Braun has been working with Los Angeles prosecutors to resolve the case so that Polanski can travel freely throughout the world.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It's been 40 years since Roman Polanski set foot on the US mainland, but the disgraced director is said to want to square things up and come back to America without facing jail time, TMZ reports. What needs squaring: his punishment for raping a 13-year-old girl in 1977 at Jack Nicholson's house. Lawyer Harland Braun reportedly wants long-sealed testimony in the Polanski case opened to prove that Polanski had cut a deal to spend just 48 days behind bars for the sexual assault. But when the director of Rosemary's Baby was released after serving 42 days, which included psychiatric evaluation, the judge (now deceased) who'd reportedly signed off on the deal allegedly had a change of heart and decided 50 years in prison was a more just punishment. Polanski fled to Paris, where he's been living as a fugitive since, shortly after he agreed to plead guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse and right before his sentencing, per Page Six. A Polish court ruling in a recent Polanski extradition case said Polanski, now 83, had honored his punishment with his original stint behind bars, prompting Braun to call for a Los Angeles County Superior Court to do the same. (Polanski was picked to lead the jury for France's equivalent of the Oscars this month\u2014and women's rights advocates aren't happy.)",

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) plans to search three separate areas Sunday about 2,000 kilometers (about 1,240 miles) northwest of Perth. That area totals about 216,000 square kilometers (83,000 square miles). \n \n Australian planes are being deployed to the area where the Chinese ship, Haixun 01, picked up signals that would be consistent with those emitted by an aircraft's flight recorders, said Houston, the chief coordinator of Australia's Joint Agency Coordination Centre. \n \n A number of white objects were sighted about 56 miles (90 kilometers) away from where the sound was detected, he said. \n \n But he stressed that were was so far no confirmation that the signals and objects are related to Flight 370. \n \n \"In the days, weeks and possibly months ahead, there may be leads such as the one I'm reporting to you this morning on a regular basis,\" Houston, a retired air chief marshal, said. \n \n Handheld hydrophone \n \n Video on Chinese state-run CCTV shot Saturday shows crew members from the Haixun 01 boarding a small yellow dinghy and using what appears to be a handheld hydrophone. The three men on board lower the device into the water on a pole. \n \n The handheld ping-locating technology used by the Chinese ship is not as versatile as a U.S. Navy towed locator, which goes as deep as 20,000 feet, far from surface noise, according to experts. \n \n The U.S. Navy hydrophone -- or underwater microphone, is on board the Australian ship Ocean Shield, which recently joined the search for Flight 370. \n \n The state-run Chinese news agency, Xinhua, said a detector deployed by the Haixun 01 patrol ship picked up the signal around 25 degrees south latitude and 101 degrees east longitude. \n \n JUST WATCHED Australia leads Flight 370 search Replay More Videos ...

But the proximity of the two finds raised hopes that this time might be different. \n \n The ship first detected a signal Friday but couldn't record it because the signal stopped abruptly, a Shanghai-based Communist Party newspaper said. The signal detected Saturday, the Jiefang Daily said, occurred at 3:57 p.m. Beijing time (3:57 a.m. ET) and lasted about a minute and a half. It was not clear whether the signal had anything to do with the missing plane. \n \n A China Central Television correspondent aboard the Haixun-01 (pronounced \"high shuen\") reported that the 37.5 kHz signal was detected for a minute and a half. \n \n Fleeting acoustic \n \n Houston confirmed the two separate detections and said they showed \"some promise.\" \n \n But the signals picked up by the Chinese searchers were \"fleeting acoustic events,\" he said. \"It's not a continuous transmission. If you get close to the device, we should be receiving it for a longer period of time.\" \n \n The signal \"is the standard beacon frequency\" for the plane's cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder, said Anish Patel, president of pinger manufacturer Dukane Seacom. \n \n \"They're identical.\" \n \n The frequency was chosen for use in the recorders \"to give that standout quality that does not get interfered with by the background noise that readily occurs in the ocean.\" \n \n Photos: The search for MH370 Photos: The search for MH370 Two years after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 went missing, a relative of one of the passengers burns incense in Beijing on March 8, 2016.

There have been many apparently promising leads over the past few weeks that have looked like the search team closing in, only for those leads to turn into nothing. The tantalizing element is the frequency of the signal supposedly picked up. It is consistent with a black box pinger. But we know very little more about the nature of the contact. The Chinese ship is not among those that have been mentioned before as having special equipment to search for the black box pinger, but it is a very modern search-and-rescue vessel. Even with the sophisticated listening devices now being deployed in the search, the size of the search area, the range of the pinger signal, and the depths of water involved all mean it would need a lucky break at this stage to detect a signal. \n \n It is still not known why the plane diverted from its planned flight path from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing four weeks ago with 239 people on board. \n \n Race against time \n \n Two of the ships searching an area of about 217,000 sq km (84,000 sq miles) have underwater locator capabilities. \n \n Australian naval vessel Ocean Shield is using a \"towed pinger locator\" from the US Navy, while HMS Echo, which has similar capabilities, is also searching. \n \n They are trying to detect an underwater signal emitted by the data recorders. \n \n The battery-powered signal fades after 30 days. \n \n The area - about 1,700km (1,000 miles) north-west of Perth - has been picked on the basis of analysis of the satellite data. \n \n On Saturday, Malaysia announced it had set up three ministerial committees to help co-ordinate the search, and a new investigation team which would include members from Australia, China, the US, the UK and France.",

Its Clydesdales are American commercial icons and Budweiser's red, white and blue cans send a not-so-subtle message that despite the brewery's German roots, it's American to the last drop.

Some prisoners were spared immediate death and kept in the work units known as the sonderkommando, forced to help in the gas chamber operations and the disposal of bodies. \n \n The researchers digging at the site reportedly don't have any evidence that the newly discovered escape tunnel was ever actually used. Prisoners at Sobibor did, however, stage an uprising in October 1943. Six-hundred prisoners revolted and managed to kill nearly a dozen of their guards. Many of the 300 laborers who broke out of the extermination camp were eventually captured and killed, and only 50 escapees are believed to have survived the war. \n \n After the uprising, Nazi officials leveled the camp and covered its traces.

The 72-year-old Durst agreed to the sentence as part of a guilty plea in February. \n \n Durst still faces a separate murder charge in California. He is accused of killing a female friend in 2000 to keep her from talking to prosecutors about the disappearance of Durst's first wife in 1982. Durst has steadfastly maintained his innocence. \n \n ___ \n \n Real estate heir Robert Durst will soon learn whether a federal judge accepts a 7-year-and-one-month sentence on a weapons charge that's kept him in Louisiana pending a murder trial in California. \n \n Judge Kurt Engelhardt will say Wednesday whether he approves that sentence, which the 72-year-old Durst accepted as part of his guilty plea in February. \n \n He's charged in California with killing his friend Susan Berman in 2000. His attorneys have said repeatedly that Durst is innocent, doesn't know who killed Berman, and wants to prove it. \n \n The most recent such statement was in a motion Monday asking U.S. District Judge Kurt Engelhardt to recommend that Durst serve his time at Terminal Island, California, about 30 miles from downtown Los Angeles, where Durst faces trial in Berman's death. ||||| Frail Robert Durst sentenced on gun charge in New Orleans but headed to low-security federal prison in L.A. \n \n Frail Robert Durst sentenced on gun charge in New Orleans but headed to low-security federal prison in L.A. \n \n Robert Durst, the New York real-estate heir and celebrity murder suspect who twice chose New Orleans as a hideout, moved closer Wednesday to escaping another hot Louisiana summer behind bars. \n \n U.S. District Judge Kurt Engelhardt sentenced the ailing Durst, 73, to an agreed-upon 85-month prison term on a federal gun count resulting from a search of his room last year at the JW Marriott hotel in downtown New Orleans. \n \n A call from the hotel to retrieve his voicemail drew authorities, who were pursuing Durst, the subject of the then-running HBO miniseries \u201cThe Jinx,\u201d in the 2000 execution-style slaying of his longtime confidante and spokeswoman, Susan Berman, in Los Angeles. \n \n Engelhardt endorsed a recommendation sought by Durst\u2019s attorneys for him to serve his sentence at a low-security federal prison facility on the Pacific coast while he awaits state prosecution for Berman\u2019s murder. \n \n Durst, appearing frail in orange St. Charles Parish jail scrubs, reurged that request before Engelhardt on Wednesday. \n \n \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting to get to California for a year so I can state my not guilty\u201d plea in Berman\u2019s killing, Durst said. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything you can do to speed up that process, I would truly, truly appreciate it. I am not guilty of murdering Susan Berman.\u201d \n \n In a legal filing this week, his attorneys cited Durst\u2019s \u201cadvanced age and poor health\u201d in their request for him to be housed at FCI Terminal Island, a federal prison with medical facilities near Los Angeles. \n \n An elaborate deal with federal prosecutors, confected as part of Durst\u2019s guilty plea in February to a charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm, would have him back in California by Aug. 18 for his arraignment in the murder case. But Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael McMahon said Wednesday that it\u2019s likely Durst will leave within a few weeks for California, assuming the federal Bureau of Prisons accepts the judge\u2019s recommendation. \n \n The gun charge stemmed from a search of Durst\u2019s hotel room on March 14, 2015, which turned up a flesh-colored latex mask with salt-and-pepper hair, five ounces of marijuana, more than $100,000 in cash and a loaded Smith and Wesson .38-caliber revolver, authorities said. His attorney said Durst has forfeited those items, including the cash, as part of his plea deal. \n \n Following his guilty plea in February, McMahon said he suspected Durst had been headed to Cuba to try to evade arrest in Berman\u2019s killing. \n \n Engelhardt had held Durst\u2019s guilty plea in abeyance pending a probation report that recommended a sentencing range of just 12 to 18 months on the gun charge. But Engelhardt, in formally accepting the deal Wednesday, noted that it also includes stipulations that authorities in New York won\u2019t prosecute him over financial maneuvering while on the lam, and that prosecutors in Texas and New Orleans won\u2019t pursue further gun counts against him related to his stay in New Orleans. \n \n Dick DeGuerin, Durst\u2019s longtime attorney, said the deal \u201ccleared the decks, at a cost. It\u2019s a serious cost, but he\u2019s not facing any other prosecution except what\u2019s in California. That\u2019s what this is all about. We want to get to California and go to trial.\u201d \n \n DeGuerin, describing Berman as Durst\u2019s \u201cbest friend,\u201d again insisted that Durst didn\u2019t kill her and doesn\u2019t know who did. He said Los Angeles prosecutors have not revealed any new evidence in the case but that he\u2019s confident Durst will beat the murder rap. \n \n \u201cHe didn\u2019t do it. That\u2019s as confident as you can get,\u201d DeGuerin said outside the federal courthouse Wednesday. \n \n Renewed interest in Durst for Berman\u2019s killing stemmed from the conclusion of the HBO show. In the final episode, Durst made what some observers described as a confession while muttering to himself off-camera, still wired with a microphone on a trip to the bathroom. \n \n \u201cWhat the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course,\u201d Durst said. \n \n The show cataloged three presumed killings of which Durst has been suspected: Berman\u2019s slaying 16 years ago; the killing of a Texas neighbor, Morris Black, for which Durst was acquitted, despite dismembering Black and dumping his remains in Galveston Bay; and the disappearance of his first wife, Kathleen Durst, in New York in 1982. \n \n Durst was a felon because of guilty pleas in 2004 to interstate transportation and possession of a firearm by a fugitive of justice. He had jumped bail in 2001 after being charged in Black\u2019s killing. \n \n While on the lam, he moved for a time to New Orleans, where he rented an apartment under a woman\u2019s name, court records show. Authorities later found a wig used to support his alias and a money clip that had belonged to Berman. \n \n Follow John Simerman on Twitter, @johnsimerman.",

My dogs are like my children.\" \n \n The Red Deer man was meeting a friend for coffee at the Whitecourt Tim Hortons on Dec. 26, when he let his two dogs Sasha and Mongo out into the parking lot for a short run. \n \n Will Gibb and his dog Sasha are recovering at home and coping with a lot of media attention 4:01 \n \n Within seconds, he said he heard Sasha, the female of the pair, start yelping. \n \n A cougar had emerged from the woods nearby and pounced, he said. \n \n \"She (Sasha) was crying out in pain and distress so I went running,\" said Gibb, a 31-year-old technician. \"And I saw something wrapped around her so I ran up and punched it in the side of the head. \n \n \"At that point I realized it was a cougar.\" \n \n Gibb said he charged into the woods after the cougar but turned around to tend to his injured dog, which was whimpering and bleeding on the pavement. \n \n 'It was pawing at me and I was throwing punches' \n \n \"I was swinging but I looked back and I saw that Sasha was on the ground kind of twitching,\" Gibb recalled. \"So I went back and tried to scoop her up with my left arm.\" \n \n But the dog, alarmed from the attack, latched onto Gibb's hand and started biting, just as the cougar re-emerged from the woods and charged a second time. \n \n In all the excitement, Sasha bit his left hand, something Gibb suggests was because the dog may have been \"thinking I was the cougar.\" \n \n He added: \"She was fighting for her life, and I was trying to keep the cougar at bay with my right, and it was pawing at me and I was throwing punches at it.\" \n \n Sasha sustained bite wounds to her neck and belly and under her legs. She was released from the veterinary clinic on Wednesday. (Travis McEwan/CBC ) \n \n While the dog unlatched her teeth from his hand and ran off, the cougar was not deterred by Gibb's punches. As Sasha ran across the parking lot, the cougar fixed its eyes on Mongo, who was sniffing around at the edge of the nearby trees. \n \n \"I could see the cougar going for him, so I got between him and the cougar and started swinging and screaming at it, and called for my brother and friend to come give a hand,\" Gibb said. \"And then I reached down for the closest, biggest stick that I could find and I ran back into the trees to go fight the cougar.\" \n \n Within minutes, both dogs were back in the safety of Gibb's truck, and the cat disappeared into the bush. \n \n \"I was surprised to hear that the owner took the quick action and it's probably what saved the dog's life in this case,\" said Sgt.

I ran over and punched it in what I thought was the head, and it backed off and I realized it was a cougar,\u201d Gibb, an electrician, told Reuters. \n \n \u201cI stepped over Sasha and charged at it swinging and screaming and calling for my brother and buddy to give a hand,\u201d he added. \n \n Gibb kept the cougar at bay, which he said swiped at him a few times, as he tended to his injured dog and called the police, before getting Sasha into his truck and driving her away for medical attention. \n \n He said the police arrived five or 10 minutes later and, after consulting with fish and wildlife officers, killed the cougar because of the risk it could attack another dog or even humans. \n \n Gibb himself was not seriously injured, although Sasha bit him on the hand as he was trying to rescue her. \n \n Kalis said cougar sightings were not uncommon around Whitecourt because the town is surrounded by forests, but it is unusual for them to attack dogs.",

The latter was the case in Canada last week when a man punched a cougar that had a death grip on his 80-pound husky's neck, reports Reuters. Will Gibb, a 31-year-old technician from Red Deer, had pulled up to a Tim Hortons for coffee and let his dogs Sasha and Mongo out of his truck for a quick run around the parking lot, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. When he heard Sasha yelping in pain seconds later, he \"went running\" to save her, he tells the CBC. But it wasn't until he \"punched it in the side of the head\" that he saw the animal was a cougar. (Sightings are common but attacks rare, says an RCMP deputy.) The cat ran into the woods, but the punch proved insufficient. As Gibb tried to pick up Sasha's twitching body, the apparently confused dog bit him and the cougar reemerged, so he had to throw punches with his right arm while trying to protect his dog and his hurt left arm. \"She was fighting for her life,\" Gibb says of Sasha, who ran to safety. When the cougar went for Mongo, Gibb grabbed a big stick and got in its way before chasing it off into the woods again. With a vet clinic just a block away, Sasha was tended to quickly, while local police found and killed the cougar. The vet says Sasha had to be sewn up in her chest and had deep bites around her neck, but she survived thanks to her owner. (And you thought the guy who punched a kangaroo was brave.)",

The BBC's Anna Holligan, who spoke to relatives briefed on the report, says all passengers and crew would've lost consciousness immediately as the plane broke apart in the air. A 65-foot reconstruction of a portion of the plane, revealed at the press conference, showed holes perforating the upper part of the cockpit, according to reporter Luke Harding. \"We can't be 100% sure\" that no one suffered, \"but we've got to sort of think that was the case,\" a relative says. The report mainly focuses on the cause of the crash and avoids \"blame and culpability\"; a separate criminal investigation will point fingers, reports AFP. The report at least rejects Moscow's claim that the Boeing 777 was downed by a missile fired by Ukrainian troops on July 17, 2014, on a flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. But about 30 minutes before the report's release, Moscow had dismissed it. \"It's always special when people already know that they don't agree with a report that's not even published yet,\" Joustra said.",
    "generated_summary": "MH17 crashed as a result of a Russian-made Buk missile, the Dutch Safety Board says. The missile hit the front left of the plane causing other parts to break off. The report does not say who fired the missile, but says airspace over eastern Ukraine should have been closed. Most of the victims were Dutch - 196, including some with dual nationality. The West and Ukraine say Russian-backed rebels brought down the Boeing 777. Russia blames Ukrainian forces, but the board does not have the authority to apportion blame, under the rules governing international crash investigations. But the board says pro-Russian rebels were in charge of the area from where the missile had been fired.",

    "document": "Woman loses assisted suicide case \n \n MARY CAROLAN \n \n A severely disabled woman in the final stages of multiple sclerosis has lost her landmark High Court challenge to the absolute ban on assisted suicide. \n \n The three-judge High Court ruled today the absolute ban is justified to protect vulnerable others from involuntary death and does not breach Marie Fleming's personal autonomy and equality rights under the Constitution and European Convention on Human Rights. \n \n A \"real risk\" of removing the ban was that, even with rigorous safeguards, it \"would be impossible to ensure that the aged, the disabled, the poor, the unwanted, the rejected, the lonely, the impulsive, the financially compromised and emotionally vulnerable would not avail of option in order to avoid a sense of being a burden on their family and society\", it said. \n \n The court also found the Director of Public Prosecutions could not issue guidelines setting out what facts she would consider in deciding whether to prosecute cases of assisted suicide. \n \n Only the Oireachtas can change the law and it would be unconstitutional for the DPP to effect a change in the law by issuing guidelines which would have the effect of the law not being enforced, it said. \n \n However, it added, if there was \"reliable\" evidence after an assisted suicide of compliance with guidelines such as those set out by the UK DPP in relation to assisted suicide prosecutions, the court said it believed the DPP here would excerise her discretion \"in this of all cases\" in a \"a humane and sensitive fashion\". \n \n Giving the court's judgment, the President of the High Court, Mr Justice Nicholas Kearns, said the court regarded Ms Fleming as \"in many ways the most remarkable witness\" all three judges had ever been privileged to encounter. \n \n \"Her courage in adversity is both humbling and inspiring\" he said. \n \n If the court could tailor-make a solution which would suit the needs of Ms Fleming alone without any possible implications for third parties or society at large, there might be a good deal to be said for her Artice 40.3.2 case [relating to personal autonomy],\" he said. \"But this court cannot be so satisfied.\" \n \n Given the public importance of the issues raised in the case, the court said it would award costs to Ms Fleming against the State and DPP. \n \n Outside court, Ms Fleming, in a statement read on her behalf by her solicitor, said she was \"very disappointed and saddened\" at the outcome. \n \n Ms Fleming\u2019s solicitor Bernadette Peart thanked the court and other legal teams involved for giving the case a full and speedy hearing, given her client\u2019s circumstances. \n \n She said: \"Obviously Marie is very disappointed and saddened at today\u2019s outcome and feels it would be inappropriate at the present time to discuss any specific legal or factual aspects of the case having regard to the likelihood of an appeal.\" \n \n Ms Fleming, a 59-year-old former lecturer living in Co Wicklow, had asked the court for orders allowing her be lawfully helped take her own life at a time of her choosing so as to avoid what she fears will be a distressing and undignified death. \n \n She argued, in her very particular circumstances, the blanket ban on assisted suicide in Section 2.2 of the Criminal Law Suicide Act 1993 breached her personal rights under the Constitution and ECHR. \n \n The State contended, while the ban may be unfair to Ms Fleming, it was a justified and proportionate measure necessary to protect vulnerable people from involuntary death. \n \n Ms Fleming, who is confined to a wheelchair, was in court today with her partner Tom Curran and other members of her family to hear the decision. It is expected she will appeal the 120-page judgment of the President of the High Court, Mr Justice Paul Carney and Mr Justice Gerard Hogan to the Supreme Court. \n \n Among the issues raised in the case was whether the rights to bodily autonomy, self-determination require provision for assisted suicide in circumstances such as those of Ms Fleming despite the public policy of preserving the right to life. \n \n Another central issue was of equality before the law. Ms Fleming argued the blanket ban was discriminatory as it meant she, as a disabled person, could not be lawfully assisted take her own life when an able-bodied person could lawfully take their own life. \n \n She had told the court Mr Curran is willing to help her end her life but she did not want him to be at risk of prosecution. \n \n The court was told doctors believe Ms Fleming may die within months and is unlikely to live beyond two years. \n \n Diagnosed with MS in 1986, her condition has deteriorated to a point where she is confined to a wheelchair with limbs paralysed, suffers acute pain and has difficulty swallowing. She fears she will ultimately be unable to communicate and will die a \u201chorrible\u201d death. ||||| * Court says impossible to tailor law on individual basis \n \n * Judge calls woman \"most remarkable witness\" court had seen \n \n * Follows high profile right-to-die cases in Britain \n \n By Sarah O'Connor \n \n DUBLIN, Jan 10 (Reuters) - An Irish woman terminally ill with multiple sclerosis lost her battle for the lawful right to die in the first case of its kind to be brought in Ireland, Dublin's High Court said on Thursday. \n \n Marie Fleming, a 59-year-old former university lecturer who is completely paralysed, made an impassioned plea last month to establish the right of her partner of 18 years to help her die, an act that could currently see him jailed in mainly Roman Catholic Ireland. \n \n A 'right to die' debate has played out through recent high-profile court cases in neighbouring Britain, where three people all failed in bids to win legal assistance to die. Assisted suicide is only permitted in four European countries: Belgium; Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland. \n \n Judge Nicholas Kearns said Fleming was the most remarkable witness any member of the court had encountered and acknowledged that her life has been \"rendered miserable\" after being \"ravaged by an insidious disease\". \n \n However he said it would be impossible to tailor legislation governing assisted suicide on an individual basis and doing so would be harmful to the public interest in protecting the most vulnerable members of society. \n \n \"There are no words to express the difficulty we had in arriving at this decision,\" Kearns said, reading a summary of the 121-page judgement. \n \n \"Yet the fact remains that if this court were to unravel a thread of this law by even the most limited constitutional adjudication in her favour, it would - or at least might - open a Pandora's box which would be impossible to close.\" \n \n \"VERY SADDENED\" \n \n Suicide was decriminalised in Ireland in 1993, but the ban on helping someone to commit suicide remains, with a jail sentence of up to 14 years. \n \n Kearns said he felt sure the state, which agreed to pay all legal costs, would exercise its discretion in a humane and sensitive fashion in deciding whether to prosecute if Fleming were to be assisted in taking her own life. \n \n The mother of two adult children had told the court in a composed manner last month how her life had become totally undignified and too painful to bear, and said she had planned every detail, including funeral arrangements. \n \n Her partner hugged and kissed her after the judgement was handed out and, reading a statement on her behalf outside the court, her solicitor said Fleming greatly appreciated the enormous support she had received from members of the public. \n \n \"Obviously Marie is very disappointed and saddened at today's outcome, and feels it would be inappropriate at the present time to discuss any specific legal aspects of the case having regard to the likelihood of an appeal,\" solicitor Bernadette Parte said. \n \n A recent poll found that large majorities of west Europeans favour the legalisation of assisted suicide. \n \n As well as in the four European countries, assisted suicide is also legal in the U.S. states of Oregon and Washington. \n \n The issue of amending the Irish constitution has also been highlighted recently following the death of a woman who was refused an abortion of her dying foetus, re-igniting a debate that has divided the country for decades.",

Italy is not known to have the kind of mosquitoes that spread malaria. \n \n The health ministry said Tuesday it is sending a team of experts to the Trento hospital to determine how the girl got infected, since she hadn't made any trips to countries with the parasitic disease. \n \n Malaria is a tropical disease that mostly strikes children in Africa, although parts of Asia, Latin America and the Middle East are also at risk. The disease is estimated to have killed more than 420,000 people last year. \n \n In recent years, European health officials have noted several isolated cases of locally acquired malaria, including one case in Rome in 2009. \n \n Suspicion fell on the Trento facility because it was treating two other children with malaria. But the disease does not spread easily between people and typically either requires a mosquito bite or blood transfusion. The ANSA news agency quoted the head of the Trento health service, Paolo Bordon, as saying that the child received no blood transfusions and that the malaria-infected children were being treated in other rooms with single-use equipment. \n \n Bordon suggested the girl might have caught it earlier, given the timing of her symptoms. \n \n Malaria symptoms, which include fever, a headache and chills, typically appear about 10 days after an infected mosquito bite. Bordon said it was possible the girl might have contracted the disease before arriving at the Trento hospital, possibly from a mosquito trapped in luggage. \n \n According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, there have been 75 cases of malaria linked to mosquitoes in luggage arriving in Western Europe from malaria-endemic countries in the past few decades. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n / Updated By Claudio Lavanga \n \n ROME \u2014 Malaria killed a 4-year-old girl in Italy, raising fears that the mosquito-borne disease has returned to the country after decades. \n \n Sonia Zago developed a high fever after returning home from a vacation in Bibione, a seaside town on the Adriatic coast near Venice. \n \n As her condition worsened, she was taken to a hospital in the northern city of Trento. Within an hour of arriving, the girl had fallen into a coma and was diagnosed with malaria. Zago was then transferred to a hospital in Brescia that treats tropical diseases, but she died on Sunday night. \n \n The girl had never traveled to a risk-prone country, raising questions about how she contracted the disease. \n \n \"It baffles us how she could have been infected\" \n \n The Ministry of Health confirmed Tuesday that it had dispatched a team of experts to investigate. \n \n Dr. Claudio Paternoster, director of the infectious diseases ward at Santa Chiara hospital in Trento, said that he had not seen a case of home-grown malaria during his 30-year career. \n \n He said that Zago had been admitted to the facility about two weeks ago due to suspected diabetes and had shared a ward with two children who had contracted malaria while in Burkina Faso. \n \n \"It\u2019s not probable, almost impossible, to pass on the [parasite] from patient to patient,\" Paternoster told NBC News. \"So the only option I can think of is that the mosquito that carried the disease may have traveled to Italy, and survived somehow.\" \n \n Tropical diseases expert Alberto Matteelli, left, is flanked by Ezio Belleri, general manager of the \"Spedali Civili\" hospital, as they meet the media in Brescia, Italy on Sept. 5, 2017. Italy's health ministry has ordered an investigation into the death of a 4-year-old girl from malaria after checks determined she hadn't traveled to any country at risk for the disease. Filippo Venezia / ANSA via AP \n \n He added: \"It baffles us how she could have been infected.\u201d \n \n Italy has been malaria-free since the 1950s, with most recorded cases linked to tourists who returned from countries where it is common. \n \n Paternoster speculated that climate change may be to blame. \n \n \u201dIt was a long and very hot summer,\" Italian daily Corriere della Sera quoted Paternoster as saying. \n \n On Tuesday, the World Health Organization was hosting a meeting in Moscow to discuss how to keep Europe malaria-free.

It is a parasite, not a virus. ||||| In A Case That Is 'Almost Impossible,' Girl Dies Of Malaria In Italy \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Sinclair Stammers/Getty Images/Science Photo Library RM Sinclair Stammers/Getty Images/Science Photo Library RM \n \n A 4-year-old girl has died of malaria in Italy, where the disease is thought to have been wiped out. Troubled health officials are looking for answers. \n \n The girl was taken to the hospital Saturday in her Alpine hometown of Trento after she developed a high fever, according to the Italian newspaper, Corriere della Sera. Lab tests confirmed she was infected with cerebral malaria, the deadliest kind. The girl had already fallen into a coma. She was transferred to a hospital specializing in tropical diseases in neighboring Brescia, where she died in the early morning hours Monday, reports the daily newspaper. \n \n \"This is the first time in 30 years of career that I have been involved in a case of native malaria in Trentino,\" Dr. Claudio Paternoster, an infectious disease specialist at Trento's Santa Chiara Hospital, told the newspaper. \n \n Malaria was endemic throughout Italy until the first half of the 20th century, especially in coastal and marshy areas hospitable to the mosquitoes carrying the disease. But a campaign launched in 1947 to eradicate malaria, mainly through pesticides, proved to be successful. \n \n The World Health Organization declared Italy malaria-free in 1970. Since then there have been cases of malaria reported, but almost all of them have been imported, says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \n \n Now health officials are trying to piece together how and where the girl may have been infected. \n \n \"It's a mystery, almost impossible,\" Paolo Bordon, general manager of the provincial health service, tells Corriere della Sera. \n \n The child had never traveled abroad, but she had recently returned from a vacation in Bibione, a coastal resort northeast of Venice on the Adriatic Sea. \n \n Corriere della Sera reports that the trip \u2014 in the first weeks of August \u2014 is compatible with the incubation period for malaria. \n \n The BBC reports that the child had previously been treated for her diabetes at the Trento hospital, where two other children were recovering from malaria they had caught in Africa. \n \n While patient-to-patient transmission of the disease is rare, it is possible. Yet Paternoster tells Corriere della Sera that the girl was treated in a different ward from the infected children and she did not have a blood transfusion. \n \n Officials are also considering the \"mosquito in a suitcase\" theory, where an infected insect could have been brought over by a traveler. \n \n Just one kind of mosquito \u2014 the Anopheles \u2014 (and only females at that) can transmit the disease, and it is not known to live in Italy. \"(To) our knowledge, there are no vectors suitable for transmitting malaria in Trentino and Italy,\" Paternoster told Corriere della Sera. But he says an investigation is underway to see if the mosquito is once again present in the region. \n \n \"It has been a hot summer and with climate change it is not possible to exclude the adaptation of some species,\" Paternoster said. \n \n But as NPR's Michaeleen Doucleff has reported, it can be tricky to definitively link climate change to the spread of vector-borne diseases, in part, because the life span of mosquitoes is so short and may only be made shorter in warmer weather. \n \n Malaria is caused by a parasite that leads to flu-like symptoms. And every year, millions of people are sickened with the disease. Many recover, but small children are especially vulnerable. \n \n Ninety percent of malaria cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa, where it kills about 3,000 children every day, according to UNICEF. \n \n Europe was declared malaria-free in 2015. \n \n This week the World Health Organization is hosting a meeting in Moscow to discuss keeping Europe malaria-free. ||||| Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption The female Anopheles mosquito passes on the malaria parasite by feeding on human blood \n \n A four-year-old Italian girl has died of cerebral malaria in northern Italy, a region free of the disease, in what doctors see as a very mysterious case. \n \n Sofia Zago died in Brescia on Sunday night, after being rushed to hospital with a high fever on Saturday. \n \n Italy is free of the Anopheles mosquito that carries cerebral malaria, the deadliest form of the blood disease. But after a scorching August, some fear that it might have reached Italy. \n \n A flight could have brought it in. \n \n Sofia had been on holiday with her parents at Bibione, an Adriatic resort near Venice. \n \n Trento, where the girl's malaria was diagnosed on Saturday, lies within the Trentino region in the foothills of the Alps. \n \n \"It's the first time in my 30-year career that I've seen a case of malaria originating in Trentino,\" said Dr Claudio Paternoster, an infectious diseases specialist at Trento's Santa Chiara Hospital. \n \n Since the 1950s, Italy has not had a malaria problem because mosquito-infested marshes were drained. \n \n There is speculation that Sofia might have caught malaria from one of two children treated for it at the Trento hospital after 15 August. They had caught it in Africa, and recovered. \n \n Sofia had had treatment there for child diabetes and there was a break before her emergency readmission to the hospital at the weekend. \n \n A Trentino health official, Paolo Bordon, said Sofia had not been in the same ward as the other two children. Sofia had not had a blood transfusion, he added, stressing that the treatments for malaria and diabetes were utterly different. \n \n The Plasmodium Falciparum parasite carried by the Anopheles mosquito can kill a human within 24 hours. \n \n About 438,000 people died of malaria in 2015 in the 95 tropical countries where it is endemic, Italy's Corriere della Sera daily reports. \n \n Extreme gardening to tackle malaria \n \n Three countries get first malaria vaccine \n \n Malaria drugs fail for first time in UK \n \n Rare case for Europe \n \n By Michelle Roberts, Health Editor, BBC News Online \n \n Only some types of mosquito are able to transmit the disease from person to person. \n \n Risky insects are found in large areas of Central and South America, Africa, Asia, the South Pacific and some parts of Eastern Europe, but not in the rest of Europe. \n \n As a result, malaria is largely limited to tropical areas - cases appearing within the European Union are typically \"suitcase\" ones, linked to recent travel to other parts of the world where malaria is present. \n \n The latest case in northern Italy has baffled experts. It is not clear how the girl caught it, but her case is not unique. \n \n The European Centre for Disease Prevention Control closely monitors cases and has found a few cases of \"locally acquired\" malaria in the EU - two in France and three in Spain in 2014. \n \n But there were explanations for how some of these might have occurred. One was a patient who had received a kidney from a donor with malaria; another was a newborn whose mother had recently returned from Equatorial Guinea. \n \n One of the Spanish patients had no history of travel, but lived a few kilometres from a town where a \"suitcase\" malaria person lived. No infected local mosquitoes were found, but lab tests showed two people had an identical strain of the disease.",

    "document": "Americans have gone to England and been pancaked by London black cabs because they looked the wrong way before crossing the street. Americans have unluckily picked seven-day stretches of rain for their week's vacation in the sceptered isle. But Mitt Romney might be having the worst English vacation since Harald Hardr\u00e5de's, and his is only two days old. \n \n Even if you feel neutrally about Romney, it's impossible to escape the sensation that he believes Basic Competence murdered his family and that he must have his revenge against it. Things are so bad that any second now Matt Drudge might run a link claiming that Romney's VP pick will actually be a fully Weekend at Bernies'd Ronald Reagan. \n \n That said, it's kind of nice to know that even when rich people go on vacation, it can still be a giant headache, like it is for the rest of us. Because that's what this is\u2014a vacation. \n \n Though his campaign bills Romney's overseas trip as a foreign policy junket, it's far less than that. Romney has pledged to honor the American tradition that politics end at the nation's borders, so that eliminates a lot substantive commentary. He also has almost nothing to say about foreign policy even when he's off the leash. \n \n Mitt's policy is, \"I'm different.\" He opposes Obama's withdrawal plan from Afghanistan, but he won't offer one of his own. His \"alternate\" plans for Libya and Syria are similar mysteries. He says he'd do \"the opposite\" of what Obama's done in Israel, but apart from some ineffectual shaming language about settlements, Obama's as much in the AIPAC tank as anyone else. \n \n Much of his policy can be inferred from his book title, No Apology: The Case for American Greatness, which echoes his fabricated attack that Obama is ashamed of America and constantly seeks the world's pardon for it. Obama is a mewling Carterite; Romney fears nothing. He needs no excuse. Perhaps he might like one for this, which appeared in I Don't Care, Mom: You Can Make Me Say Sorry, But I Won't Mean It: \n \n England [sic] is just a small island. Its roads and houses are small. With few exceptions, it doesn't make things that people in the rest of the world want to buy. And if it hadn't been separated from the continent by water, it almost certainly would have been lost to Hitler's ambitions. \n \n Fortunately, as of Friday morning, the English press hadn't erupted in outrage over those comments. Unfortunately, all Romney could really accomplish on this trip was look informed and presidential, and he did neither. The English press had so much to roast him with that his trip looked more like a script for The Thick of It that Armando Iannucci wadded up and threw in the trash because it seemed \"too fucktarded.\" \n \n It's not clear whether Romney's Baedeker is out of date or if his guide to England is The Lonely Planet: Kolob. But the highlights are hilarious. Click here to get in the right frame of mind, strap the dog to the roof, and let's hop in the Wagon Queen Family Truckster: \n \n In an interview with Brian Williams, Romney questioned Britons' enthusiasm for the Olympics, asking, \"\"Do they come together and celebrate the Olympic moment? [That's] something which we only find out once the Games actually begin.\" This led London Mayor Boris \"THE ROCK\" Johnson to fire up a crowd by going for cheap pops. \"I hear there's a guy called Mitt Romney who wants to know whether we're ready,\" he said. \"Are we ready?\" The crowd cheered wildly. Then Johnson asked if the crowd smelled what he was cooking and urged Romney to check out of the five-star hotel where he was staying and holding fundraisers with the LIBOR-fixers who defrauded the world and instead check di-rect-ly into the Smackdown Hotel (in Penge). He then spent the rest of the speech just calling Romney \"that jabroni.\" Everything after \"Are we ready?\" might be made up, but that's the price you pay for watching THE MOST ELECTRIFYING MAYOR IN BRITS' ENTERTAINMENT. \n \n Romney described some of Britain's preparation as \"disconcerting,\" citing rumors of a strike and \"the private security firm not having enough people.\" This is the sort of gaffe that, if made by a Democrat, would see Republican pundits screaming DANGER! DANGER!, because suddenly a security shortfall was being broadcast to OUR ENEMIES, THE ISLAMOFASCIST OLYMPIC BOMB-SHOTPUTTING TEAM. Instead, British PM David Cameron explained some of the inevitable planning hitches while calling Romney out on his record of running the 2002 Winter Olympics in a metro area of 12 million fewer people, unencumbered by the traffic and historical development restrictions of a city roughly 2,000 years old. \"We are holding an Olympic Games in one of the busiest, most active, bustling cities anywhere in the world,\" Cameron said. \"Of course it's easier if you hold an Olympic games in the middle of nowhere.\" The zinger was almost savage, considering Cameron usually has the wit and agility of a haircut stapled to a pair of trousers. \n \n Romney talked about \"[looking] out of the backside of 10 Downing Street.\" While \"backside\" has the same buttock connotation in the United States, in England the spacial/location aspect of the term would have taken a distant second place. Basically, the first assumption the natives would have had, upon hearing it, was to think Romney said he was staring out of Downing Street's asshole. Whether they interpreted that to refer to David Cameron depends on party affiliation. \n \n Lastly, Romney mentioned meeting with the head of MI6, whose schedule is very rarely reported. British overseas intelligence is far more opaque than America's, to the extent that the existence of MI6 wasn't even officially acknowledged by perfidious Albion until the 1990s. An American analogue might be Tony Blair coming to the states in 2002 and saying he had a lovely lunch with Dick Cheney at his undisclosed location. Anybody could then check Blair's schedule and see that from noon to 1:30 he was scheduled to \"spend time walking around that abandoned North Dakota missile silo the Cigarette Smoking Man trapped Krycek and the black oil in.\" \n \n Romney even had time to send unfavorable signals back to the United States. In the same Brian Williams interview, Mitt said that he wouldn't watch the Olympic performance of his wife's six- or seven-figure dressage horse Rafalca (one whose future earnings could net the family $77,000 in tax breaks). Perhaps owning a horse whose purchase price might have been equivalent to the median price of roughly four new American homes defines \"out of touch.\" But turning around and showing utter disinterest in the same fabulously expensive thing seems even worse. Sure, go ahead and own something whose cost is obscene, but at least appreciate it. If you're going to own a horse worth more than many of your fellow Americans, do them a solid and act like you fucking enjoy the experience. It's like Romney bought a vintage Ferrari, decided owning a million-dollar car looked bad and said, \"I don't drive it. I gave it to my dumbfuck nephew.\" Then you Google the nephew's name, and he looks just like Matthew Lillard. \n \n Still, it wasn't all bad! Mitt and his bodyguard found Romney Road. One assumes it's a traffic-restricted private roadway zoned only for palanquins, but the picture is nice. And the good news for comedy fans is that Mitt could continue this Bataan Clown March so intensely that his first two days pale in comparison. Think of the possibilities (including his trips to Poland and Israel): \n \n Loudly complaining in the Olympic stadium that his chair is too low and he needs a Stone of Scone to sit on so he can see better. \n \n Cheerfully greeting every woman named \"Laurie\" by asking how much junk she's hauling around behind her. \n \n Driving on the right side of the road and mowing down gruel-stained orphans one after another after another. \n \n Refusing to release the forms he filed to get his VAT back on exiting the country. \n \n Congratulating England on being a country where every fag \"gets smoked.\" \n \n Screaming at some kids in an elevator that they should just lift themselves up by their bootstraps. \n \n Insisting on blasting \"Ride of the Valkyries\" out of his helicopter as it comes in to land in Tel Aviv. \n \n Moving his lips and making noise even when Sheldon Adelson is drinking a glass of water. \n \n Flipping a coin at Polish President Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski and saying, \"Your country's still a little bombed-out. How about you buy yourself some vowels and a clue?\" \n \n This could be fun. There's no reason not to have these kinds of high aspirations for a man who inspired the normally loathsome John Podhoretz to tweet that he was \"like Mr. Bean, only he's an American.\" \n \n And, look, maybe this seems a little mean-spirited, like piling on. Mitt has these periods of wealthy-guy boobery that make you want to feel sorry for him. Sometimes it seems like the poor twit can't help it. Then, sadly, there are all those times it's unmistakable that he can. \n \n Because it was one of Romney's advisors\u2014someone for whom he is responsible, both as the leader of his campaign and the quadrennial high priest of the GOP Leadership Cult\u2014who anonymously said that Obama did not appreciate the U.S. and Great Britain's shared Anglo-Saxon heritage. \n \n Maybe you want to streeeeeeeeetch and say that the advisor referred to the neocon dream of a global-security \"anglosphere\" community of nations. But the Romney campaign knows full well exactly how this kind of commentary resonates and with whom, and this is how Mitt Romney relentlessly drives away sympathy. He might be bumbling around Piccadilly Circus looking for the elephant show, but his campaign is efficiently casting Obama in the role of \"the other.\" He can be the Kenyan anti-colonialist other (who did the Kenyans rebel against?\u2014gasp\u2014BRITAIN!), or he can just be un-American. \n \n Regardless, the president who doesn't share our Anglo-Saxon values also just happens to be the first black president. Sure, he's half-white, and his mother's maiden name is hardly uncommon in the land of Angles and Saxons, but whatever. Not appreciating \"the shared history we have\" excludes Obama beautifully. As one famous Englishman once said, \"Nudge, nudge. Wink, wink.\" \n \n Say no more. \n \n [Image: Getty] ||||| If Barack Obama were dreaming up the ideal start to Mitt Romney's first overseas visit as the presumptive Republican nominee, the president might wonder whether his rival could offend the US's historic transatlantic ally. \n \n That would obviously be rejected as impossibly ambitious, so the president might then ask himself whether Romney would fail to remember the name of one of his hosts in London. \n \n Surely a successful businessman would never make such a basic error. So the president would wonder whether Romney would breach convention by saying in public that he met the head of MI6, Britain's overseas intelligence agency. \n \n To the undoubted joy of the White House, Romney stumbled on all those fronts in London on Thursday, the first day of his visit to three of the US's closest allies - Britain, Israel and Poland. \n \n Downing Street, which had gone to great lengths to give Romney the red carpet treatment without breaching strict protocol rules, was astonished when he questioned whether London was capable of running a successful Olympics. In an interview with NBC after his arrival in London, Romney said it was \"disconcerting\" that the Olympics organizers had encountered difficulties over security. One Whitehall source described Romney's remarks as a \"total shocker\" that had rendered officials \"speechless\". \n \n David Cameron wasted no time in delivering a carefully calibrated put down. During a visit to the Olympic Park, the prime minister said Britain was delivering the games in a bustling city. \"Of course it's easier if you hold an Olympic Games in the middle of nowhere,\" the prime minister said in a none too subtle reference to the 2002 Salt Lake City games famously rescued by Romney. \n \n Cameron made clear his irritation when he met Romney later in the day for 45 minutes of talks at No 10. As he emerged from the famous front door \u2013 alone to avoid breaching protocol \u2013 Romney gave a clue as to why he had stumbled. He reeled off a list of countries he had discussed with Cameron but declined to spell out his thinking in foreign policy on the grounds that only a sitting President should pronounce on overseas soil. \n \n These remarks showed that Romney had absorbed lesson number one of overseas trips that has no doubt been drilled into him by his foreign policy advisers - do not criticize the president when you are out of the US. Sadly for Romney, he forgot an even more important lesson that is so obvious his advisers had probably not bothered to spell it out: try not to offend your host, particularly when he is the leader of your closest sister party in a country that is meant to enjoy a \"special relationship\" with the US. \n \n The comparisons with Romney's trip to Europe and Obama's visit at almost exactly the same stage in the electoral cycle four years ago are almost too embarrassing to mention. Obama wooed a quarter of a million people in Berlin while Romney was mocked by the British prime minister. \n \n Romney will no doubt be hoping that his faux pas will be remembered as an amusing blip in the Anglo-American special relationship which has undergone a turbulent decade as a left-of-center prime minister embraced a right wing president. \n \n It will not have escaped the attention of Romney that Ed Miliband, a relatively left wing leader of the Labour party, was the most relaxed person of the day when he was referred to as \"Mr Leader\". Aides said they forgave Romney because US politicians always refer to fellow leaders by their job title.",

    "document": "Comcast probably doesn't relish being one of those companies that many Americans love to hate. But sometimes, the cable giant makes this way too easy. \n \n Consider the case of Ricardo Brown. After Brown's wife had a disagreement with the cable company recently, Comcast started sending him monthly statements under the name \"Asshole Brown.\" \n \n The disagreement happened when Brown's wife Lisa tried to cancel her cable. She got referred to one of the company's dreaded \"retention specialists,\" who apparently didn't like being told \"no,\" as Lisa Brown told the blogger Christopher Elliott, who first reported the story. \n \n \"I was never rude,\" she told Elliott. \"It could have been that person was upset because I didn\u2019t take the offer.\" \n \n Like many phone companies and ISPs, Comcast makes it frighteningly difficult to cancel an account. The company retains an army of retention specialists whose sole job is to keep you from signing off. Last year, the journalist Ryan Block recorded a Kafkaesque conversation he had with a Comcast retention specialist from hell. That call has been listened to nearly 6 million times. \n \n Comcast spokesman Steve Kipp confirmed the Browns' story to WIRED. \"We have spoken with our customer and apologized for this completely unacceptable and inappropriate name change,\" he told us via email. \"We have zero tolerance for this type of disrespectful behavior and are conducting a thorough investigation to determine what happened. We are working with our customer to make this right and will take appropriate steps to prevent this from happening again.\" \n \n According to Elliott, Comcast is also offering the Browns a full refund for the past two years of service. ||||| Warning: This post contains language that may not be appropriate for a family audience. \n \n It\u2019s no secret that employees sometimes feel their customers are jerks. But I\u2019ve never seen one put it in writing \u2014 until now. \n \n \n \n Lisa Brown, a volunteer for a missions organization in Spokane, Wash., contacted me about a billing problem with Comcast, her local cable provider. The issue? Someone at Comcast changed the name on their bill from her husband\u2019s name, Ricardo, to \u201cAsshole\u201d Brown. \n \n Seriously. \n \n Brown has tried to fix the name herself. She\u2019s visited her local Comcast office and phoned higher-ups in the Washington region. But she wasn\u2019t getting anywhere and needed help. \n \n Comcast changed the billing name \n \n My first thought was that someone was trying to pull a practical joke on a consumer advocate. So I asked for a copy of the billing statement and the correspondence between her and Comcast. \n \n And no kidding, it looked like someone had changed the name. How impolite! \n \n Next, I contacted Comcast to find out what its records said. It\u2019s fairly easy for any customer to doctor a photo of a bill to shame a large company, so I wanted to make sure the company was seeing the same thing. \n \n It was. \n \n A few minutes later, I received a call from Steve Kipp, Comcast\u2019s vice president of communications for the Washington region. \n \n \u201cWe have spoken with our customer and apologized for this completely unacceptable and inappropriate name change,\u201d he said. \u201cComcast has zero tolerance for this type of disrespectful behavior and are conducting a thorough investigation to determine what happened. We are working with our customer to make this right and will take appropriate steps to prevent this from happening again.\u201d \n \n I asked Brown why an employee might want to change Ricardo\u2019s name to Asshole. \n \n \u201cI am shocked,\u201d she told me. She explained that her family was having financial difficulties and needed to reduce their cable bill. She\u2019d called Comcast to cancel the cable portion of her account, for which she had to pay a $60 fee. Instead of complying immediately, a representative escalated her call to a retention specialist, who tried to persuade her to keep the cable service and sign a new two-year contract. \n \n \u201cI was never rude,\u201d she says. \u201cIt could have been that person was upset because I didn\u2019t take the offer.\u201d \n \n What is a fair resolution from Comcast? \n \n Brown, who has been a Comcast customer for the last two years, believes the company should offer a more generous refund. Also, she wants to send a letter to Comcast\u2019s vice president in charge of customer service. \n \n Comcast quickly made steps toward fulfilling her wishes. First, there was a call from Rhonda Weaver, a Comcast senior director of government affairs, promising to waive the $60 cancellation fee. Weaver also said Comcast was investigating the name change and would terminate the employee who was responsible. \n \n Then there was a call from Ken Watts, a Comcast general manager for Spokane. He assured her they\u2019d corrected the name on her account. He also promised a swift investigation and that he would find the vice president\u2019s address. \n \n (Well, I can probably help with that: here are the Comcast executive emails.) \n \n Comcast seems genuinely sorry for what happened, but Brown wonders if it\u2019s sorry enough. \n \n \u201cThis is unacceptable,\u201d she says. \u201cI am requesting everything back I paid Comcast for doing this to me.\u201d \n \n But what is enough? \n \n Should Comcast refund two years\u2019 worth of cable bills? Or is an apology, a refund of the cancellation fee, and firing the employee, enough? \n \n Here\u2019s hoping Comcast\u2019s other reps will keep their opinions of their customers to themselves. Based on their customer service scores, we kinda know what they\u2019re thinking. \n \n Do we really need to have it in writing? \n \n Update (4:20 p.m., 1/28/2015): Brown says Comcast contacted her this afternoon, offering \u201cthe full two years refunded and another two years free.\u201d \n \n Update (3:30 a.m., 1/29): Brown contacted me with a clarification: \u201cComcast did not give me two years free. Just the refund of two years.\u201d \n \n Update (noon, 1/29): Comcast has issued a more detailed response to this incident. \n \n What should Comcast do?

The bill continued to read: \"A--hole Brown.\" Yes, you read that right. The bill had previously been addressed to \"Ricardo Brown\" (her husband's name) but was apparently changed by a Comcast employee. Brown suspects the alteration occurred after she called to cancel her cable services. Wired points out that Comcast makes it \"frighteningly difficult\" to ax services, and Brown was indeed redirected to a retention specialist during her call. She says she was \"never rude,\" but was firm: She wanted to pay the $60 termination fee and pare down her services. Elliott dove in, first verifying with Comcast that the bill hadn't been altered by Brown and did indeed contain the unfortunate first name. Verification made. (Wired verified the story as well.) A regional VP of communications then called Elliott to express that the company has \"zero tolerance for this type of disrespectful behavior\"; a Comcast director vowed to fire the offending employee. The company's initial offer to Brown: waiving that $60 fee. Brown expressed to Elliott that she thought she deserved more, saying, \"I am requesting everything back I paid Comcast for doing this to me\"\u2014everything meaning two years' worth of bills.

MUST WATCH Actor Mickey Rooney dies at 93 03:02 \n \n Mickey Rooney's court-appointed conservator, who is also named as executor in the will, told CNN on Friday that the challenge of the will \"is totally without merit.\" \n \n Since there is not much money to fight over, attorney Michael Augustine said Rooney's widow, who was separated from her husband the last two years of his life, was seeking public attention with the challenge. \"She cannot resist her additional five minutes of fame,\" Augustine said. \n \n Although Rooney disinherited his children, his wife and all but one of her children in a will he signed just weeks before his death, court papers suggest there is not much in his estate to fight over.

You can find it online.\u201d \n \n Conway\u2019s remark appears to violate the executive branch\u2019s ban on staff endorsing products or companies. The regulation, from the Office of Government Ethics, also prohibits using public office for private gain of oneself or friends or relatives. \n \n Under the regulation, OGE\u2019s director can notify the employee of the violation and ask the agency to investigate. The director can recommend discipline, including suspension, loss of pay or termination, but would probably just issue a warning for a first offense. \n \n Conway said Thursday night on Fox News that she had spoken with the president about the controversy and said it was a \u201cvery heartening moment.\u201d \n \n \u201cI am just really happy that I spent an awful lot of time of the president of the United States this afternoon and that he supports me 100 percent,\u201d she said. \n \n At his daily briefing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Conway had \"been counseled on that subject, and that's it,\" declining to further elaborate on whether the White House believed the counselor to the president had crossed a line. \n \n But lawmakers suggested that it did. Reps. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) and Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the chairman and ranking member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, respectively, wrote in a letter to OGE Director Walter Shaub that Conway\u2019s interview \u201craised extremely serious concerns.\u201d \n \n \u201cAs the director of OGE, you have authority to review potential ethics violations and notify the employee\u2019s agency, which in this case is the White House,\u201d they said. \u201cIn this case, there is an additional challenge, which is that the President, as the ultimate disciplinary authority for White House employees, has an inherent conflict of interest since Conway\u2019s statements relate to his daughter\u2019s private business.\u201d \n \n They asked that OGE \u201creview Conway\u2019s statement and act promptly on the basis of your findings,\u201d as well as report back to the House panel with a recommendation for disciplinary action, if necessary. \n \n Cummings earlier Thursday had said in a letter to Chaffetz, \u201cThis appears to be a textbook violation of government ethics laws and regulations enacted to prevent the abuse of an employee\u2019s government position,\u201d and asked for a committee \u201creview and potential disciplinary action.\u201d \n \n Chaffetz seemed to agree, telling The Associated Press that Conway\u2019s remark was \u201cwrong, wrong, wrong, clearly over the line, unacceptable.\u201d \n \n \"It needs to be dealt with,\" Chaffetz had said. \"There's no ifs, ands or buts about it.\" \n \n A host of liberal, progressive and nonpartisan advocacy groups filed complaints against Conway, including the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which filed its complaint with both OGE and the White House Counsel\u2019s Office. \n \n \u201cMs. Conway appears to have violated both the letter and the spirit of these rules when she used her position to endorse the accessories and clothing line of Ms. Trump, the daughter of the president,\u201d the CREW complaint says. \u201cFurthermore, we are concerned about what appears to be a pattern developing of the use of official offices, particularly the White House and the Executive Office of the President, to benefit business interests of relatives and supporters of the president; Ms. Conway\u2019s comments appear to be just the latest example of this trend.\u201d \n \n Ordinarily, a violation in the White House would be dealt with by the White House counsel. But it\u2019s not clear how the regulation will be enforced under a president who, based on his own statement Wednesday, seems likely to approve of what Conway said. (The president himself is technically exempt from the regulation, but White House policy has long applied it to him.) \n \n Likely sparked by Conway's remark, web traffic to the OGE's website surged Thursday to the point that it became inaccessible for much of the day. On Twitter, the office wrote that \"OGE\u2019s website, phone system and email system are receiving an extraordinary volume of contacts from citizens about recent events.\u201d The office later added that it \"does not have investigative or enforcement authority.\u201d \n \n An OGE spokesman said the agency was \"looking at ways to redirect traffic and add capacity\" to make its website accessible again. \n \n Citing declining sales for Ivanka Trump\u2019s label, Nordstrom announced earlier this month that it would no longer carry her line, a move that sparked anger from Donald Trump, who tweeted Wednesday that his daughter had \u201cbeen treated so unfairly\u201d by the department store. \n \n Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, have been highly visible members of the administration since Donald Trump took office just under three weeks ago. The president\u2019s daughter accompanied him to Dover Air Force Base last week for the return of the remains of a Navy SEAL killed during a raid in Yemen and has advised him on policy issues, including the environment and parental leave. \n \n Conway told Fox News she found it \u201cironic that you\u2019ve got some executives all over the internet bragging about what they\u2019ve done to [Ivanka] and her line.\u201d \n \n \u201cYet, they\u2019re using the most prominent woman in Donald Trump\u2019s \u2014 you know, most prominent \u2014 she\u2019s his daughter, and they\u2019re using her, who has been a champion for women empowerment, women in the workplace, to get to him,\u201d she continued. \u201cI think people could see through that. Go buy Ivanka's stuff is what I would tell you. I hate shopping. I\u2019m going to go get some myself today.\u201d \n \n While Nordstrom claimed that the decision to drop Ivanka Trump\u2019s line of clothing and shoes was based solely on business, at least some of the decline in sales of her products could be attributed to the #GrabYourWallet campaign urging consumers to boycott Trump products. \n \n Nordstrom also hasn\u2019t shied away from voicing opposition to Trump\u2019s policies, releasing a statement in support of immigrants in the wake of the president\u2019s executive order temporarily banning individuals from certain Muslim-majority nations from entering the U.S. in the name of national security. The retailer announced its decision to drop Ivanka Trump\u2019s line three days after releasing that statement. \n \n On Fox News, Conway called Ivanka Trump a \u201cvery successful businesswoman\u201d and an \u201cincredibly confident, creative, talented woman\u201d and indicated that should be welcomed into a role at the White House to work on women's empowerment issues, if she so chooses. \n \n \u201cObviously, she\u2019s stepped away from it now, but in the past she\u2019s helped to run her family\u2019s real estate empire, and on the side she developed another fully, unbelievably, entrepreneurial, wildly successful business that bears her name,\u201d Conway added. \u201cAnd I think she\u2019s gone from 800 stores to 1,000 stores or 1,000 places where you can buy \u2014 you can certainly buy her goods online.

The White House reaction was a rare acknowledgment of an ethical misstep. \n \n Conway\u2019s remarks drew a sharp and unusual rebuke from a top Republican lawmaker, House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), who said that Conway\u2019s comments were \u201cabsolutely wrong, wrong, wrong\u201d and \u201cclearly over the line.\u201d \n \n Chaffetz, who has resisted calls by Democrats to investigate potential conflicts related to President Trump\u2019s businesses, joined with the Oversight Committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), in sending a letter to the Office of Government Ethics calling Conway\u2019s comments \u201cunacceptable.\u201d The letter asked the agency to recommend discipline given that Trump, who is Conway\u2019s \u201cagency head,\u201d holds an \u201cinherent conflict of interest\u201d due to the involvement of his daughter\u2019s business. \n \n In a terse comment to reporters Thursday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that Conway had been \u201ccounseled on the subject\u201d but did not say whether she would be disciplined. Spicer did not say why Conway\u2019s statements had required the intervention, and the White House declined to answer further questions. \n \n President Trump\u2019s counselor Kellyanne Conway at the White House on Jan .24. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post) \n \n Speaking on Fox News Thursday evening, Conway declined to comment but said Trump supports her \u201c100 percent.\u201d \n \n Conway said she advised all women to, at some point in their life, have a boss who treats them \u201cthe way the president of the United States treated me today.\u201d \n \n The incident was the latest illustration of how the Trump White House has struggled to grapple with long-established ethics rules as the president has attempted to balance the potentially competing interests of his new public position and his family\u2019s vast business holdings. \n \n The matter has grown politically thorny in recent weeks as many opponents of Trump\u2019s policies have waged a campaign to boycott the family\u2019s brands and protest at its properties. The tensions underscore the difficulty Trump faces in carrying through on his vow to separate his presidency from his businesses \u2014 particularly given that he and his daughter have refused to divest their ownership stakes. \n \n The president has faced criticism from ethics experts and Democratic lawmakers who have warned that his public power could be misused to enrich him and his family. Trump has turned over the management of his businesses to his two adult sons and a longtime executive. \n \n Although Trump has said that most ethics laws and rules do not apply to the president, Conway\u2019s stumble Thursday served as a reminder that staffers are nonetheless subject to those provisions. \n \n The Conway episode followed other instances in which Trump\u2019s political rise and his presidency have provided a promotional platform for the family businesses. \n \n 1 of 10 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Controversial comments from Kellyanne Conway that made headlines View Photos Conway, counselor to President Trump, coined the term \u201calternative facts\u201d and referred to a \u201cBowling Green massacre\u201d that never happened.

The lawsuit said that the August 2016 article, which falsely suggested that Melania Trump had once worked for an escort service, damaged her ability to build \u201cmultimillion dollar business relationships for a multi-year term\u201d and damaged her brand during a time when Trump \u201cis one of the most photographed women in the world.\u201d \n \n A day later, after ethics experts criticized the notion of Melania Trump attempting to make money from her public role, her attorney and a spokeswoman issued statements saying that the first lady \u201chas no intention\u201d of using her position for profit. \n \n The first family has struggled to cleanse its public appearances of private entanglements. \n \n In his official biography on the White House website, Donald Trump boasts of the success of the business he still owns and cites his book \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d which remains for sale. \n \n Melania Trump\u2019s initial online biography referenced her jewelry line, once sold on the cable television channel QVC, and noted its trademark, a registration now overseen by a federal office led by her husband. \n \n Ivanka Trump, whose brand includes dresses, shoes, skirts, handbags, jewelry and accessories, much of which is sold online and at dozens of the United States\u2019 largest retailers and department-store chains, mixed her business and newly elevated political profile shortly after the election. \n \n Hours after she was interviewed by CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d about her father\u2019s victory, her jewelry line alerted journalists to the fact that she was wearing an \u00adIvanka-brand diamond bracelet, which viewers could buy for $10,800. \n \n Conway\u2019s endorsement of Ivanka Trump\u2019s brand followed a tweet Wednesday by President Trump complaining that his daughter had \u201cbeen treated so unfairly\u201d by the department store Nordstrom, which dropped her clothing line, citing slow sales. \n \n Conway touted Ivanka Trump\u2019s \u201cwonderful line\u201d of clothing and shoes during an interview Thursday morning with \u201cFox & Friends\u201d from the White House briefing room. \n \n Responding to national boycotts of Ivanka Trump merchandise, Conway said, \u201cGo buy Ivanka\u2019s stuff is what I would tell you.\u201d \n \n \u201cI\u2019m going to give a free commercial here,\u201d she added. \u201cGo buy it today, everybody. You can find it online.\u201d \n \n Experts quickly seized on Conway\u2019s remarks as a direct violation of Office of Government Ethics rules. Don W. Fox, a former OGE acting director and general counsel, said Conway\u2019s statements were \u201cjaw-dropping\u201d and \u201ca clear violation of rules prohibiting misuse of public office for anyone\u2019s private gain.\u201d \n \n Peter Schweizer, who has worked closely with Trump chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and wrote a book, \u201cClinton Cash,\u201d that was critical of donations to the Clinton Foundation, said, \u201cThey\u2019ve crossed a very, very important, bright line, and it\u2019s not good.\u201d \n \n \u201cTo encourage Americans to buy goods from companies owned by the first family is totally out of bounds and needs to stop,\u201d \u00adSchweizer added. \u201cClearly, the Trumps feel some of this is related to politics. But whether that\u2019s true or not, these marketing battles need to be fought by Ivanka and her company. They cannot and should not be fought by government employees and the White House.\u201d \n \n Schweizer said that it was time for Trump \u201cto move beyond the mind-set and the role of a businessman and assume the mantle of commander in chief.\u201d \n \n Federal law states that the director of the Office of Government Ethics can advise the White House and Conway of the violation and recommend disciplinary action. But the OGE\u2019s recommendations are nonbinding, and the ultimate decision resides with the White House. \n \n OGE officials did not respond to requests for comment. By midmorning, the agency\u2019s website had crashed, and the OGE\u2019s official Twitter account said that the office\u2019s phone and email systems were receiving \u201can extraordinary volume\u201d of citizen input about \u201crecent events.\u201d \n \n The office tweeted that its role is to help prevent ethics violations but not to investigate allegations that rules have been broken \u2014 a job reserved for the FBI, inspectors general and other watchdogs. Still, the OGE notifies agencies of possible ethics violations and asks for reports on any action taken, a process the office indicated it is \u201cactively following,\u201d according to the OGE\u2019s tweets. \n \n Experts said that a typical \u00adexecutive-branch employee who violated the endorsement rule could face significant disciplinary action, including a multi-day suspension and loss of pay. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service employees, for instance, face a five-day suspension or termination for using public office for private gain. \n \n But enforcement measures are largely left to the head of the federal agency \u2014 in Conway\u2019s case, the White House. Conway\u2019s counseling, independent lawyers said, could have included a meeting with members of the White House counsel\u2019s office, but it remained unclear what disciplinary steps would be taken. \n \n Independent ethics groups and Trump critics targeted the endorsement as a make-or-break moment for how the White House will address future ethical concerns. \n \n Noah Bookbinder, director of the liberal Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which filed an official ethics complaint, called Conway\u2019s comments \u201cjust another example of what looks like a disturbing pattern of this administration acting to benefit the businesses of the president\u2019s family and supporters.\u201d \n \n Conway\u2019s endorsement of Ivanka Trump\u2019s business also highlighted an awkward reality for a White House threatening U.S. companies seeking to move jobs or operations overseas. Nearly all Ivanka-brand merchandise is manufactured in low-cost-labor countries, including China, Indonesia and Vietnam. \n \n The president and his daughter have taken steps to put distance between their private companies and public ambitions. Both resigned their official leadership roles in the Trump Organization. \n \n Ivanka Trump retains a financial interest in her separate business. The Trump company says the president does not have a financial interest or ownership stake in the Ivanka brand. \n \n [Fact Checker: Trump\u2019s claim Ivanka is being \u2018treated so unfairly\u2019 by Nordstrom]",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 \"Go buy Ivanka's stuff.\" That was Kellyanne Conway's message to viewers during an interview with Fox & Friends on Thursday after Nordstrom pulled Ivanka Trump's clothing line from its stores. The problem? She might have violated federal ethics rules with the plug. Government workers aren't supposed to endorse products, and Conway not only did so, she wasn't shy about it: \"I'm going to give a free commercial here,\" she said. \"Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online.\u201d Per the Hill, this is the rule from the Office of Government Ethics she appears to have run afoul of: \"An employee shall not use his public office for his own private gain, for the endorsement of any product, service, or enterprise, or for the private gain of friends, relatives.\" It's not clear whether the OGE will investigate, but someone who violates this rule can be suspended or even fired, though the person is likely to receive only a warning for a first offense, reports Politico. \"This is jaw-dropping to me,\" a former acting director of the office tells the Washington Post. It \"would seem to be a clear violation.\" President Trump, of course, has also addressed Nordstrom's move, tweeting, \"Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom.\" White House spokesman Sean Spicer says Trump's tweet \"was less about his family's business and an attack on his daughter,\" per CNNMoney. Nordstrom has said the decision was about declining sales, not politics.",

    "document": "As graphic images (like the one above) of the suspected Mandalay Bay massacre gunman Stephen Paddock circulate across the internet, the question of who is leaking those crime scene photographs has become a point of concern for Las Vegas investigators. \n \n In a press conference last night, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Undersheriff Kevin McMahill noted: \n \n \u201cThere was a question about the validity of the crime scene photos that somebody had leaked. I can confirm those are, in fact, photos from inside of the room; they are in fact photos of our suspect, and as the sheriff mentioned previously, we have all opened up an internal investigation to determine the source of the leaks of those photos to the public.\u201d \n \n As leaks from major investigations have become a fact of life for municipal police departments, LawNewz wondered what penalties those leakers might find themselves subject to. While a cursory foray into the niceties of the Nevada Revised Statutes turned up no particular state laws on point here, previous high-profile leaks made by those within or close to police departments may offer a bit of insight. \n \n In 2009, photographs of pop star Rihanna were leaked by (now former) Los Angeles Police Department (\u201cLAPD\u201d) officer Rebecca Reyes. Rihanna had recently been attacked during a domestic violence incident with then-boyfriend Chris Brown and the investigation was still underway as the photos made their way to the press, starting with TMZ. LAPD higher-ups then made it their business to find out who had taken and leaked the photos. After an administrative hearing and appeal, Reyes lost her job\u2013while escaping criminal prosecution. \n \n In 2016, following the terrorist attack at the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, crime scene photographs made their way to the front page of the New York Times. British investigators were furious and pinned the blame on U.S. law enforcement. President Donald Trump echoed that fury, calling for an official investigation. It\u2019s unclear what that investigation determined\u2013or if one even occurred. However, the fallout from those leaks was so great that British intelligence began withholding information from their U.S. partners for at least a brief period of time. And anyone on the receiving end of a U.S. government investigation into leaks would probably fare none too well. Just ask Chelsea Manning (or Reality Winner\u2014or the 12 other people prosecuted by Barack Obama for leaking) about that. \n \n All this is to say that the leaker of the Paddock photographs\u2013even if they\u2019re not found guilty of an actual crime\u2013likely won\u2019t receive anything approaching leniency if and when their identity is discovered. And that could be sooner than later. Las Vegas Metro Police Department also has an internal affairs department which investigates situations like this, and an internal process for doling out any potential discipline including suspension and/or termination. \n \n At last night\u2019s press conference, McMahill also pleaded with the press for \u201cpatience,\u201d noting that no one wanted a speedier resolution than police and the victims\u2019 families. He said, \u201cWe\u2019re days away from the completion of the processing of the room [at Mandalay Bay].\u201d \n \n For an FAQ promoted by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, see here. \n \n [image via screengrab] \n \n Follow Colin Kalmbacher on Twitter: @colinkalmbacher ||||| Images from inside Stephen Paddock\u2019s Las Vegas hotel room reveal a jumble of high-powered weapons, dozens of scattered shell casings, a possible note, along with his corpse. \n \n The leaked photographs, some of them too graphic to publish, suggest Paddock killed himself with a shot to the head shortly before a police SWAT team stormed his room.

    "document": "AUCKLAND, New Zealand\u2014The New Zealand spy agency, the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB), worked in 2012 and 2013 to implement a mass metadata surveillance system even as top government officials publicly insisted no such program was being planned and would not be legally permitted. \n \n Documents provided by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden show that the government worked in secret to exploit a new internet surveillance law enacted in the wake of revelations of illegal domestic spying to initiate a new metadata collection program that appeared designed to collect information about the communications of New Zealanders. Those actions are in direct conflict with the assurances given to the public by Prime Minister John Key (pictured above), who said the law was merely designed to fix \u201can ambiguous legal framework\u201d by expressly allowing the agency to do what it had done for years, that it \u201cisn\u2019t and will never be wholesale spying on New Zealanders,\u201d and the law \u201cisn\u2019t a revolution in the way New Zealand conducts its intelligence operations.\u201d \n \n Snowden, in a post for The Intercept published today, accused Prime Minster Key of fundamentally misleading the public about GCSB\u2019s role in mass surveillance. \u201cThe Prime Minister\u2019s claim to the public, that \u2018there is no and there never has been any mass surveillance\u2019, is false,\u201d the former NSA analyst wrote. \u201cThe GCSB, whose operations he is responsible for, is directly involved in the untargeted, bulk interception and algorithmic analysis of private communications sent via internet, satellite, radio, and phone networks.\u201d \n \n Snowden explained that \u201cat the NSA, I routinely came across the communications of New Zealanders in my work with a mass surveillance tool we share with GCSB, called \u2018X KEYSCORE.\u201d\u201d He further detailed that \u201cthe GCSB provides mass surveillance data into XKEYSCORE. They also provide access to the communications of millions of New Zealanders to the NSA at facilities such as the GCSB facility in Waihopai, and the Prime Minister is personally aware of this fact.\u201d \n \n Top secret documents provided by the whistleblower demonstrate that the GCSB, with ongoing NSA cooperation, implemented Phase I of the mass surveillance program code-named \u201cSpeargun\u201d at some point in 2012 or early 2013. \u201cSpeargun\u201d involved the covert installation of \u201ccable access\u201d equipment, which appears to refer to surveillance of the country\u2019s main undersea cable link, the Southern Cross cable. This cable carries the vast majority of internet traffic between New Zealand and the rest of the world, and mass collection from it would mark the greatest expansion of GCSB spying activities in decades. \n \n Upon completion of the first stage, Speargun moved to Phase II, under which \u201cmetadata probes\u201d were to be inserted into those cables. The NSA documents note that the first such metadata probe was scheduled for \u201cmid-2013.\u201d Surveillance probes of this sort are commonly used by NSA and their partners to tap into huge flows of information from communication cables in real time, enabling them to extract the dates, times, senders, and recipients of emails, phone calls, and the like. The technique is almost by definition a form of mass surveillance; metadata is relatively useless for intelligence purposes without a massive amount of similar data to analyze it against and trace connections through. \n \n The NSA declined to comment for this story. A GCSB spokesperson would only say: \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on matters that may or may not be operational.\u201d \n \n Over the weekend, in anticipation of this report, Key admitted for the first time that the GCSB did plan a program of mass surveillance aimed at his own citizens, but claimed that he ultimately rejected the program before implementation. Yesterday, after The Intercept sought comment from the NSA, the Prime Minister told reporters in Auckland that this reporting was referring merely to \u201ca proposed widespread cyber protection programme that never got off the ground.\u201d He vowed to declassify documents confirming his decision. \n \n But the documents indicate that Speargun was not just an idea that stalled at the discussion stage. It was a system GCSB actively worked to implement. One top secret 2012 NSA document states: \u201cProject Speargun underway.\u201d Another top secret NSA document discussing the activities of its surveillance partners reports, under the heading \u201cNew Zealand,\u201d that \u201cPartner cable access program achieves Phase I.\u201d \n \n Critically, the NSA documents note in more than one place that completion of Speargun was impeded by one obstacle: The need to enact a new spying law that would allow the GCSB, for the first time, to spy on its own citizens as well as legal residents of the country. As one NSA planning document put it, completion of Speargun was \u201cawaiting new GCSB Act expected July 2013.\u201d \n \n That legislation arose after it was revealed in 2012 that the GCSB illegally surveilled the communications of Megaupload founder Kim Dotcom, a legal resident of New Zealand. New Zealand law at the time forbade the GCSB from using its surveillance apparatus against citizens or legal residents. That illegal GCSB surveillance of Dotcom was followed by a massive military-style police raid by New Zealand authorities on his home in connection with Dotcom\u2019s criminal prosecution in the United States for copyright violations. \n \n A subsequent government investigation found that the GCSB not only illegally spied on Dotcom but also dozens of other citizens and legal residents. The deputy director of GCSB resigned. The government\u2019s response to these revelations was to refuse to prosecute those who ordered the illegal spying and, instead, to propose a new law that would allow domestic electronic surveillance. \n \n That proposal was intensely controversial, prompting large public protests and a concerted campaign against the law. One news broadcaster called it \u201cone of the most polarizing pieces of legislation in recent times.\u201d It was of sufficient interest to the NSA that in March 2013, the director of Prime Minister Key\u2019s Intelligence Coordination Group traveled to NSA headquarters to offer an update on the legislation. \n \n To assuage the public, Key and other top officials repeatedly insisted that the real purpose of the law was merely to provide oversight and to clarify that targeted domestic surveillance which had long been carried out by the agency was legal. Key categorically denied that the law would allow mass metadata collection on the New Zealand public: \u201cThere have been claims this Bill offers no protection of metadata and allows for wholesale collection of metadata without a warrant. None of that is true.\u201d \n \n Key told the public that the new law would not permit mass, warrantless metadata surveillance: \u201cSo when the GCSB wants to access metadata, it is treated with the same level of seriousness and protection as if the GCSB was accessing the actual content of a communication. And there are protections around that.\u201d \n \n In response to Key\u2019s claims, legal experts extensively documented that the new law would indeed provide \u201ca major increase in the overall role and powers of the GCSB\u201d and would allow the \u201cvery broad \u2018wholesale\u2019 powers\u201d which Key denied. Yet the Key government, and the prime minister himself, steadfastly insisted that the law permits no mass surveillance. At one point, Key even promised to resign if it were found that the GCSB were engaging in mass surveillance. \n \n Based on Key\u2019s assurances, the New Zealand Parliament narrowly voted to enact the new law on August 21 of last year, by a vote of 61-59. Immediately prior to passage, Key acknowledged that the new law has \u201c\u2018alarmed\u2019 some people but blame[d] the Government\u2019s opponents for stoking their fears\u201d and again \u201crejected that by writing into law what the GCSB had already been doing meant an extension of its powers.\u201d \n \n But in high-level discussions between the Key government and the NSA, the new law was clearly viewed as the crucial means to empower the GCSB to engage in metadata surveillance. On more than one occasion, the NSA noted internally that Project Speargun, in the process of being implemented, could not and would not be completed until the new law was enacted. The NSA apparently viewed that new law as providing exactly the powers that Key repeatedly and publicly denied it would vest. \n \n New Zealand\u2019s national election will be held on September 20. Over the last several weeks, Key has been embroiled in a scandal that saw a top minister resign, after independent journalist Nicky Hager published a book, Dirty Politics, documenting ties between Key officials and a right-wing blogger known for attacking public figures and showing that Key officials declassified information for political purposes. \n \n Revelations of illegal GCSB spying prompted the creation of the anti-surveillance Internet Party, which formed an alliance with the left-wing, indigenous Mana Party and is predicted to win several seats in Parliament. The party is funded by Dotcom, and has organized a \u201cMoment of Truth\u201d event for this Monday to discuss revelations of surveillance and other secret government actions. (Disclosure: Glenn Greenwald, one of the authors of this story, is scheduled to speak at that event pursuant to an invitation from the Internet Party, which paid his travel expenses to attend and agreed to donate a speaking fee to a designated charity.) \n \n The disclosure that the GCSB plotted a program of mass surveillance based on this new law is likely to raise further questions about the ethics and credibility of the Key government. The new surveillance planning took place at high levels of the government, and expressly intended to use the new surveillance law as its basis even as Key himself insisted that the law provided no such authority. \n \n Photo: Rob Griffith/AP \n \n Additional reporting provided by Andrew Fishman ||||| Accused government whistleblower Edward Snowden is seen on the computer screen of a journalist on the internet site of the Council of Europe, as he speaks via video conference with members of the Committee on legal Affairs and Human Rights of the Parliamentary Assembly of... \n \n WELLINGTON New Zealand was preparing to conduct mass domestic surveillance last year, a U.S. investigative journalist said on Monday, five days before the country goes to the polls, provoking immediate denials from Prime Minister John Key. \n \n The accusations by Glenn Greenwald were based on evidence disclosed by former U.S. National Security Authority contractor Edward Snowden that Key's center-right government planned to exploit amended spying laws to sharply widen domestic spying. \n \n Greenwald said the NSA documents showed New Zealand's electronic spy agency took the first steps towards the surveillance in a project dubbed 'Speargun', by tapping into an undersea telecoms cable into the country, while waiting for the legal authority to do so. \n \n \"Phase one entailed accessing that cable, tapping into it, and then phase two would entail metadata probes,\" Greenwald said on Radio New Zealand National. \n \n Key rejected the charges as \"absolutely wrong\", and said a business case put up by the agency, the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB), early last year aimed at mass cyber protection, but was turned down by his government. \n \n \"There is not, and never has been, a cable access surveillance program operating in New Zealand,\" Key said in a statement, as he released several declassified papers to back his position. \n \n \"There is not, and never has been, mass surveillance of New Zealanders undertaken by the GCSB.\" \n \n Snowden's material can be accessed at: here \n \n New Zealand law provides that the GCSB, which conducts electronic surveillance and is part of the \"Five Eyes\" surveillance network along with the United States, Britain, Australia, and Canada, can only spy on New Zealand citizens if requested by a domestic law enforcement or intelligence agency. \n \n Key said Greenwald, who was brought to New Zealand by millionaire internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom, was being used to try to influence voters ahead of the election. \n \n Dotcom, who is fighting extradition to the United States on charges of internet piracy, copyright breaches, and money laundering, has paid for Greenwald's trip to New Zealand. \n \n Greenwald appeared at a public meeting of more than 1,000 people organized by a political party being bankrolled by Dotcom, at which the ebullient German had promised revelations damaging to Key. \n \n Snowden and Wikileaks founder Julian Assange addressed the meeting through video links. \n \n New Zealand media said the revelations involved an alleged email between a Warner Brothers film studio executive and the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), suggesting Key colluded with them to allow Dotcom to settle in New Zealand so that it would be easier to detain and extradite him. \n \n Warner Brothers and the MPAA said the email was a fake, and Key said he made no such comments to the film executives. \n \n Controversy around Dotcom's arrest and the protracted ongoing effort to extradite him, as well as charges of illegal spying, have dogged Key's government over the past two years. \n \n In the past month links between his government and right-wing bloggers have prompted separate accusations of dirty tricks against political opponents. \n \n But Key, largely unscathed in opinion polls, remains the favorite to gain a third consecutive term, although he is likely to need the support of minor parties to secure a majority. NZPOLL \n \n (Reporting by Gyles Beckford and Naomi Tajitsu; Editing by Clarence Fernandez) ||||| Like many nations around the world, New Zealand over the last year has engaged in a serious and intense debate about government surveillance. The nation\u2019s prime minister, John Key of the National Party, has denied that New Zealand\u2019s spy agency GCSB engages in mass surveillance, mostly as a means of convincing the country to enact a new law vesting the agency with greater powers. This week, as a national election approaches, Key repeated those denials in anticipation of a report in The Intercept today exposing the Key government\u2019s actions in implementing a system to record citizens\u2019 metadata. \n \n Let me be clear: any statement that mass surveillance is not performed in New Zealand, or that the internet communications are not comprehensively intercepted and monitored, or that this is not intentionally and actively abetted by the GCSB, is categorically false. If you live in New Zealand, you are being watched. At the NSA I routinely came across the communications of New Zealanders in my work with a mass surveillance tool we share with GCSB, called \u201cXKEYSCORE.\u201d It allows total, granular access to the database of communications collected in the course of mass surveillance. It is not limited to or even used largely for the purposes of cybersecurity, as has been claimed, but is instead used primarily for reading individuals\u2019 private email, text messages, and internet traffic. I know this because it was my full-time job in Hawaii, where I worked every day in an NSA facility with a top secret clearance. \n \n The prime minister\u2019s claim to the public, that \u201cthere is no and there never has been any mass surveillance\u201d is false. The GCSB, whose operations he is responsible for, is directly involved in the untargeted, bulk interception and algorithmic analysis of private communications sent via internet, satellite, radio, and phone networks. \n \n If you have doubts, which would be quite reasonable, given what the last year showed us about the dangers of taking government officials at their word, I invite you to confirm this for yourself. Actual pictures and classified documentation of XKEYSCORE are available online now, and their authenticity is not contested by any government. Within them you\u2019ll find that the XKEYSCORE system offers, but does not require for use, something called a \u201cFive Eyes Defeat,\u201d the Five Eyes being the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia, and yes, New Zealand. \n \n This might seem like a small detail, but it\u2019s very important. The Five Eyes Defeat is an optional filter, a single checkbox. It allows me, the analyst, to prevent search results from being returned on those countries from a particular search. Ask yourself: why do analysts have a checkbox on a top secret system that hides the results of mass surveillance in New Zealand if there is no mass surveillance in New Zealand? \n \n The answer, one that the government of New Zealand has not been honest about, is that despite claims to the contrary, mass surveillance is real and happening as we speak. The GCSB provides mass surveillance data into XKEYSCORE. They also provide access to the communications of millions of New Zealanders to the NSA at facilities such as the GCSB station at Waihopai, and the Prime Minister is personally aware of this fact. Importantly, they do not merely use XKEYSCORE, but also actively and directly develop mass surveillance algorithms for it. GCSB\u2019s involvement with XKEYSCORE is not a theory, and it is not a future plan. The claim that it never went ahead, and that New Zealand merely \u201clooked at\u201d but never participated in the Five Eyes\u2019 system of mass surveillance is false, and the GCSB\u2019s past and continuing involvement with XKEYSCORE is irrefutable. \n \n But what does it mean? \n \n It means they have the ability see every website you visit, every text message you send, every call you make, every ticket you purchase, every donation you make, and every book you order online. From \u201cI\u2019m headed to church\u201d to \u201cI hate my boss\u201d to \u201cShe\u2019s in the hospital,\u201d the GCSB is there. Your words are intercepted, stored, and analyzed by algorithms long before they\u2019re ever read by your intended recipient. \n \n Faced with reasonable doubts, ask yourself just what it is that stands between these most deeply personal communications and the governments of not just in New Zealand, but also the U.S., Canada, the U.K., and Australia? \n \n The answer is that solitary checkbox, the Five Eyes Defeat. One checkbox is what separates our most sacred rights from the graveyard of lost liberty. When an officer of the government wants to know everything about everyone in their society, they don\u2019t even have to make a technical change. They simply uncheck the box. The question before us is no longer \u201cwhy was this done without the consent and debate of the people of this country,\u201d but \u201cwhat are we going to do about it?\u201d \n \n This government may have total control over the checkbox today, but come Sept. 20, New Zealanders have a checkbox of their own. If you live in New Zealand, whatever party you choose to vote for, bear in mind the opportunity to send a message that this government won\u2019t need to spy on us to hear: The liberties of free people cannot be changed behind closed doors. It\u2019s time to stand up. It\u2019s time to restore our democracies. It\u2019s time to take back our rights. And it starts with you. \n \n National security has become the National Party\u2019s security. What we\u2019re seeing today is that in New Zealand, the balance between the public\u2019s right to know and the propriety of a secret is determined by a single factor: the political advantage it offers to a specific party and or a specific politician. This misuse of New Zealand\u2019s spying apparatus for the benefit of a single individual is a historic concern, because even if you believe today\u2019s prime minister is beyond reproach, he will not remain in power forever. What happens tomorrow, when a different leader assumes the same power to conceal and reveal things from the citizenry based not on what is required by free societies, but rather on what needs to be said to keep them in power? \n \n Photo: David Rogers/Getty Images",

(Associated Press) \n \n In this courtroom drawing, Clare Bronfman, right, is arraigned at federal court in New York, Tuesday, July 24, 2018. Bronfman, a daughter of the late billionaire philanthropist and former Seagram chairman Edgar Bronfman Sr., and three other people associated with the NXIVM organization were taken into... (Associated Press) \n \n NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 An heiress to the Seagram's liquor fortune and three other people were arrested on Tuesday in connection with the investigation of a self-improvement organization accused of branding some of its female followers and forcing them into unwanted sex. \n \n Clare Bronfman, 39, a daughter of the late billionaire philanthropist and former Seagram chairman Edgar Bronfman Sr., surrendered to the FBI and pleaded not guilty to racketeering charges. \n \n She was freed from custody following a late-afternoon court appearance where she pledged to post a $100 million bond to ensure her return to court. \n \n U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis set the high amount after hearing prosecutors label her a flight risk and learning she has a net worth of roughly $200 million, including a stake in an island resort in Fiji. \n \n Bronfman, who appeared in court wearing flip-flops and a T-shirt, didn't comment as she left a federal courthouse in Brooklyn. She was to remain under house arrest following her release. \n \n A former competitor in international equestrian show jumping competitions, Bronfman is accused in an indictment of taking a number of steps to help NXIVM's founder and leader, Keith Raniere, exercise control over members of the upstate New York group, including identity theft, interception of electronic communications and money laundering. \n \n She was part of an \"inner circle\" of loyalists who \"committed a broad range of serious crimes from identity theft and obstruction of justice to sex trafficking, all to promote and protect Raniere and NXIVM,\" U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue said in a statement. \n \n Raniere was arrested in Mexico this year and was brought to the U.S. to face charges that he, along with an adherent, the TV actress Allison Mack, coerced followers into becoming slaves to senior members. \n \n In a statement, a lawyer for Bronfman, Susan Necheles, called the charges \"the result of government overreaching and charging an individual with crimes just because the government disagrees with some beliefs taught by NXIVM and held by Clare.\" \n \n \"We are confident that Clare will be exonerated,\" she said. \n \n Also arrested Tuesday were Nancy Salzman, who was the organization's longtime president; her daughter, Lauren Salzman; and a former bookkeeper for the group, Kathy Russell. All three were released on bail without entering pleas. \n \n Despite criticism for years by ex-followers who called NXIVM a cult and a pyramid scheme, the organization's intense self-improvement classes had, at one point, earned it thousands of adherents, including some with Hollywood ties. They included Nicki Clyne, an actress who appeared on \"Battlestar Galactica\"; Bronfman's sister Sara Bronfman; a son of former Mexican president Carlos Salinas de Gortari; and India Oxenberg, a daughter of \"Dynasty\" actress Catherine Oxenberg. \n \n In an indictment, prosecutors say Mack, who played a teenage friend of Superman in the CW network's \"Smallville,\" helped Raniere recruit women to a secret sub-society within NXIVM whose members were branded by way of a surgical tool with a symbol that resembled his initials. Women were expected to be subservient to \"masters,\" prosecutors said, including giving in to demands for sex. \n \n The arrest of Bronfman, who has long been affiliated with NXIVM, wasn't a surprise. At a court hearing in June, a judge rejected an attempt to get Raniere released on $10 million bail paid for by Bronfman after prosecutors labeled her a co-conspirator. \n \n In earlier court filings, the government detailed how Bronfman gave away tens of millions of dollars of her fortune to support Raniere and his group, including paying for private air travel at a cost of $65,000 a flight. It also said Bronfman has \"paid for numerous lawyers to bring suits against Nxivm critics.\" \n \n In a website post last year, Bronfman called the secret society a \"sorority\" that \"has truly benefited the lives of its members, and does so freely.\" She added, \"I find no fault in a group of women (or men for that matter) freely taking a vow of loyalty and friendship with one another to feel safe while pushing back against the fears that have stifled their personal and professional growth.\" \n \n Raniere and Mack have also denied the allegations. In their court papers, the defense lawyers have said the supposed victims of the group were never abused and were in fact \"independent, smart, curious adults\" searching for \"happiness, fulfillment and meaning.\" \n \n Raniere, Mack and some of the other defendants were expected to appear together at a pretrial hearing on Wednesday in Brooklyn. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press Writer Mary Esch contributed to this report from Albany, New York. ||||| Image copyright Reuters Image caption Clare Bronfman is the daughter of the late billionaire philanthropist Edgar Bronfman \n \n A liquor heiress is facing charges of funding a suspected US sex cult whose recruits were allegedly branded with the initials of its founder. \n \n Seagram scion Clare Bronfman, 39, is accused of using her fortune to help finance Nxivm's operations. \n \n Investigators say the organisation is a sex-trafficking operation disguised as a mentoring group. \n \n Six people have now been charged as part of the inquiry, including 35-year-old Smallville actress Allison Mack. \n \n Ms Bronfman's lawyer said her client \"did nothing wrong\". \n \n She was formally charged on Tuesday before being released on a $100m (\u00a375m) bail bond. \n \n What is Nxivm? \n \n On its website Nxivm (pronounced nexium) describes itself as a \"community guided by humanitarian principles that seek to empower people and answer important questions about what it means to be human\". \n \n Based in Albany in upstate New York, the group was founded as Executive Success Programs in 1998 and says it has worked with more than 16,000 people. \n \n Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Smallville actress Allison Mack was charged earlier this year with sex trafficking \n \n Members of the group are reported to include the son of a former Mexican president and Hollywood actresses. \n \n Federal prosecutors allege Nxivm's leader Keith Raniere, 57, oversaw a \"slave and master\" system within the group. Female members were expected to have sex with him and were branded with his initials, say former members. \n \n According to the group's website, it has suspended enrolment and events because of the \"extraordinary circumstances facing the company at this time\". \n \n What is Clare Bronfman accused of? \n \n Ms Bronfman, the daughter of late billionaire philanthropist and Seagram head Edgar Bronfman, was arrested on Tuesday along with three others on charges of racketeering conspiracy, US prosecutors say. \n \n Court documents allege Ms Bronfman, a member of Nxivm's executive board, was involved in the identity theft of at least two women - including a deceased sexual partner of Mr Raniere. \n \n She is also accused of encouraging and assisting in an alleged Nxivm victim's illegal entry into the US. \n \n Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ms Bronfman had been a competitive equestrian, but reportedly sold her horses in recent years \n \n In a note published on her website last December, Ms Bronfman said she still supported Nxivm after seeing \"so much good come from both our programmes and from Keith himself\". \n \n Her lawyer Susan Necheles said in a statement that Nxivm was \"not a criminal enterprise\" but \"an organisation that helped thousands of people,\" according to US media. \n \n \"The charges against Clare are the result of government overreaching and charging an individual with crimes just because the government disagrees with some beliefs taught by Nxivm and held by Clare,\" Ms Necheles said. \n \n Who else has been charged? \n \n Keith Raniere himself was arrested by the FBI in Mexico in March. \n \n He and actress Allison Mack were charged with sex trafficking and forced labour conspiracy the following month. \n \n Image copyright Keith Raniere Conversations/YouTube Image caption Keith Raniere was detained in Mexico, where he has reportedly been living for several months \n \n Both face mandatory minimum sentences of 15 years and a maximum of life imprisonment for the sex-trafficking charges. \n \n Mr Raniere, whose trial is scheduled for 1 October, has been denied bail because of fears that Ms Bronfman might use her financial clout to help him escape. \n \n Nxivm co-founder Nancy Salzman, 64, her daughter, Lauren Salzman, 42, and the group's 60-year-old bookkeeper, Kathy Russell, were all arrested alongside Ms Brofman on Tuesday. \n \n All six are accused of racketeering conspiracy, or attempting to illegally obtain or extort money, and could face up to 20 years in jail, plus an additional maximum 15 years for identity theft conspiracy. \n \n The US Department of Justice says the group committed \"an array of crimes, including identity theft, extortion, forced labour, sex trafficking, money laundering, wire fraud and obstruction of justice\". \n \n FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge William Sweeney said on Tuesday that \"the details of these alleged crimes become more and more grim as we continue to dig deeper into the conduct of this organisation and its intended mission\".",

I love us.\u201d \n \n Melton has long been an outspoken advocate for same-sex marriage. \n \n \u201cFiguring out my stance on homosexuality felt like a life and death decision,\u201d she wrote in a 2013 post on her blog Momastery. \u201cI know my Jesus, I love Him, and I think if he needed me to believe that homosexuality was a sin, He would have mentioned it.\u201d \n \n She added that she hoped that her coming out would help her three children, son Chase and daughters Tish and Amma, feel emboldened to be truthful with themselves and others. \n \n \u201cWhen Craig and I sat them down to tell them about Abby I started by saying: \u2018In our family, we live and tell the truth about who we are no matter what, and then love each other through it \u2014 and I\u2019m about to show you how that\u2019s done,\u2019 \u201d she wrote. \n \n Melton\u2019s coming out announcement follows a similar revelation by Eat, Pray, Love author Elizabeth Gilbert, who revealed she had found love with her female best friend in a September Facebook post. Melton wrote about meeting Gilbert, whom she now calls a friend, in a blog post last September. ||||| I\u2019m staring at this blank page and thinking: This is one of the most important things you\u2019ll ever write. Be kind and brave, Glennon. Steady. Clear. Shameless. Gentle. True. \n \n Pretend it\u2019s just the two of us here in my kitchen. I\u2019m making us chamomile tea. I pass a mug to you and ask you to sit down on the couch with me. You follow me into my family room and and we sit down and I look at you. I can see that you\u2019re nervous because you\u2019ve figured out I\u2019m about to tell you something important. I quickly say: It\u2019s okay. Everyone is healthy. All is well. We are all okay. \n \n We are. And yet. \n \n Craig and I are separating. \n \n What happened? I am still looking for the words. While I am smack dab in the middle of the unfolding, here is my best explanation: As you\u2019ll read in Love Warrior, Craig and I endured serious trauma a few years ago. We suffered. My God, we suffered. I was broken, just completely shattered. And then we healed. It was beautiful. \n \n And this is what I learned: You can be shattered and then you can put yourself back together piece by piece. \n \n But what can happen over time is this: You wake up one day and realize that you have put yourself back together completely differently. That you are whole, finally, and strong \u2013 but you are now a different shape, a different size. This sort of change \u2014 the change that occurs when you sit inside your own pain \u2014 it\u2019s revolutionary. When you let yourself die, there is suddenly one day: new life. You are Different. New. And no matter how hard you try, you simply cannot fit into your old life anymore. You are like a snake trying to fit into old, dead skin, or a butterfly trying to crawl back into the cocoon, or new wine trying to pour itself back into an old wineskin. This new you is equal parts undeniable and terrifying. \n \n Because you just do not fit. And suddenly you know that. And you have become a woman who doesn\u2019t ignore her knowing. Who doesn\u2019t pretend she doesn\u2019t know. Because pretending makes you sick. And because you never promised yourself an easy life, but you did promise yourself a true one. You did promise \u2013 back when you were putting yourself back together \u2013 that you\u2019d never betray you again. \n \n And so one day you sit down with your beloved, wonderful, kind, brave, warrior husband and you look at him and you say: Honey. We have worked so hard, for so long. We have been warriors for each other and for our children and for this marriage. And yet. I don\u2019t fit here anymore. \n \n And your husband looks at you and, eventually through his tears, he says: Four years ago you gave me the most selfless love I\u2019ve ever received. It healed me. And now I\u2019m going to return that kind of love to you. The kind of love that only wants truth and wholeness and peace for each other. \n \n For the next several weeks, you do nothing but cry and talk. Sometimes it feels like that\u2019s all you ever do\u2014because, it turns out, you have been grieving your marriage for years. But still, you cry and talk more. You close the bedroom door and sit on that bed and you talk. You talk about how hard you\u2019ve worked together, how you stayed on your mats and didn\u2019t run from each other. Since you didn\u2019t run, you discovered together that fight or flight aren\u2019t the only options. There is a third way: heal. \n \n You talk about how broken you each were when you met, and how whole each of you is now. You say to him: You\u2019ve been my healing partner. He says: And you have been mine. You talk about how you can forgive someone and love someone and at the very same time know that you cannot be with them anymore. You get more honest than you have ever, ever been before. You talk about how hard, how very brutal it\u2019s all been for the two of you. Since day one. And you talk about how beautiful it\u2019s been for the two of you. Since day one. There is a moment in every conversation when one of you says: My God, the kids \u2013 and neither of you can go on. That\u2019s the black hole. Still is. I can\u2019t write more about that right now. Someday. Not today. \n \n You sit in a therapist\u2019s waiting room to discuss how to handle this with as much peace as possible for the kids. \n \n You sit with your children and you create a new family mission statement: \n \n Then you help your soon-to-be-ex-husband-forever-life-partner move into a rented house a few doors down. You have family dinners, plan your family summer vacation together, and you look at each other and realize you\u2019ve never loved each other more, bigger, truer. \n \n And then you tell your team. You tell the people who are invested in your career. And hot damn, this is bad timing. There is fear and panic. Because you are about to launch the biggest project of your career, the book you finished a year ago, and so many have been working so hard for its release. And it\u2019s all about your marriage. And the advice from many is: Wait, G. Just wait till after the book has launched to reveal this. This is a MARRIAGE book \u2013 you can\u2019t break up before it even comes out! Glennon \u2013 it will affect sales. It will affect your career, your success. \n \n And you will listen to this advice. And you will decide: No. \n \n Like Mama T said: I was not called to be successful. I was called to be faithful. \n \n I was called to be faithful to truth and vulnerability and to YOU. I never promised anybody I\u2019d get it all right; I promised I\u2019d keep showing up forever. Today. Whether I\u2019m in the valley or on the mountaintop. \n \n Please come close when I say this next part, it\u2019s important: This next step is not a departure from the path of the Love Warrior. This next step is the fulfillment of it \u2013 for me, for my particular journey. Love Warrior is a book about self-trust. It\u2019s a book about a woman who has painstakingly learned that there is a still, small voice guiding her through this brutiful life one next right thing at a time. And that the only thing she cannot do \u2013 not ever again \u2013 is betray that voice. Self-betrayal is allowing the fear voices to drown out the still, small voice that knows what to do and is always leading us home to ourselves and to truth and to love. Love is the boss of me, not fear, and certainly not \u201csuccess.\u201d \n \n And by the way, success to me is not staying in a marriage \u2014 it\u2019s staying in my own peace. At all costs. And so, even when it\u2019s highly inconvenient \u2013 even when it feels CRAZY \u2013 I will listen to the voice, and I will obey it. And I will be messy and complicated \u2013 and I will show up anyway. Because I\u2019ve fought too hard for my sobriety, sanity, integrity\u2014and for your trust\u2014to give it up now. \n \n So I said to the team: We tell our people now. \n \n And they said: Okay. Should we clear your schedule then? Revealing yourself in your writing about this is one thing, but do you want to be on stages with it? Won\u2019t that feel too vulnerable? \n \n And I thought about that for a while. Lord have mercy, cancelling the tour sounded good. \n \n And I decided: No. \n \n My family is here, now in two houses. But my family is also you. \n \n I will not hide from you, not now. I will show up in your cities, in your churches and theaters and on stages and I will say: HERE I AM. A little busted up, but not destroyed. I will be at my weakest, but when we are weak, then we are strong. If I\u2019m this weak, can you imagine how strong I\u2019ll be? Damn. \n \n Listen: Love is not a victory march. It\u2019s a cold and it\u2019s a broken hallelujah. So I might be cold and I might be broken but I am still gonna scream HALLELUJAH all over this country. I am going to stand in front of you with my medicated little head held high and I am going to be so busted up and broken that the light is going to pour out of me like stained glass. I know this. \n \n Here\u2019s what else I know: Some loves are perennials\u2014they survive the winter and bloom again. Other loves are annuals\u2014beautiful and lush and full for a season and then back to the earth to die and create richer soil for new life to grow. The eventual result of both types of plants is New Life. \n \n New life. Nothing wasted. No failure. Love never fails. Never, never. Love is messy and beautiful and brutal \u2013 and Love is the whole point. So, I am not afraid, I was born to do this. \n \n I\u2019m asking you, please love me through this. Be my people. The world will have opinions and I need this Love Warrior Army. Please stay close. \n \n Sister On, my beloveds. We can do hard things. We belong to each other. And LOVE WINS. \n \n G \n \n P.S. Since I publicly announced the trauma in my marriage four years ago, I have become a soft place to land for women in marriage trauma. I have listened to what kind of responses from people are helpful and which are hurtful. So many of us want to say and do the loving and supportive thing, but we sometimes don\u2019t know what that looks like. So, with humility, love (and a healthy dose of defensiveness on behalf of my heart and the hearts of my warrior sisters), I offer the following thoughts: \n \n If I don\u2019t mention something, it\u2019s not because I forgot to. It\u2019s because I desperately have to find the balance here between honesty and a tell-all. Between transparency and responsibility. What I owe you and what I owe myself. There will be parts of this story I (try to) keep for myself and Craig and the kids. If you can, please resist assumptions, gossip, or asking for details I haven\u2019t provided. I can tell you this: I feel defensive of Craig here. No one could have worked harder. There is no better father or man on earth. Craig is a hero. He is a Love Warrior. I am fiercely proud of him. \n \n Try to avoid lamenting how sad it is that people \u201cthrow away their marriages these days.\u201d Try not to generalize. I have met hundreds of divorced women who didn\u2019t throw their marriages away. Most of us fight like hell for our marriages until we realize that we can either save our marriages or save our souls. So please, I\u2019m not looking for advice. Just love and support. \n \n Please don\u2019t pretend to know what God thinks of us. Please think deeply about the chasm-wide difference between leaving a man and leaving God. Please remember that when a woman leaves, she just brings God with her. Nothing separates a woman or a family from God\u2019s love. Not death, and certainly not divorce. Jesus taught us that sometimes death is necessary for there to be new life. And that God loves us far more than any institution God made for us. When someone suggests otherwise, it brings shame to us. But we won\u2019t let that in. We are women who have become far too wise to believe in shame. \n \n Sometimes, when people make decisions about marriage, it evokes strong feelings in others. If my news does that to you today, please look inside and get curious about whether those feelings have more to do with you and your life than they do about me and mine. \n \n I will repeat this last one: Please stay close. I need you more than I\u2019ve ever needed you. \n \n \n \n ||||| This is heavy on my mind this week, so I thought I\u2019d throw all my energy and love in the Supreme Court\u2019s direction\u2026. \n \n If you haven\u2019t read the original Mountain post, please start here. \n \n I\u2019m not a smart man. But I know what Love Is. \u2013 Forrest Gump \n \n Several years ago at church, Craig and I sat through a sermon condemning homosexuality. As I listened to the sermon, which was based upon two lines of scripture in the New Testament, every fiber in my body rejected the message. My palms sweated, my heart pounded, and I started to feel queasy. I left the church building that day on fire and didn\u2019t get a good night\u2019s sleep for a month. \n \n Instead of sleeping, I spent my nights scouring scripture, researching the positions of different denominations, and praying and praying and praying some more. I wrote this to several ministers: \u201cI am a Christian and a seeker and I\u2019m trying desperately to reconcile God\u2019s commandment to love my neighbor without judgment and the church\u2019s stance on homosexuality. Would you discuss this with me?\u201d Not one minister wrote back. Every morning when the sun finally came up, I\u2019d call Sister at work. She\u2019d answer her phone with: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna talk about the gays again, aren\u2019t we, Sister?\u201d Yes, Sister. Yes, we are. Clear your schedule. \n \n Figuring out my stance on homosexuality felt like a life and death decision. When I described the intensity of my concern to other Christians, most would say, \u201cbut, why? You don\u2019t even have a gay family member.\u201d This response was very confusing to me. Isn\u2019t the whole point of Christianity that we are all family? That we should love our neighbors as ourselves? That if any of us is hungry, we are all hungry? That if any of us is oppressed, we are all oppressed? According to the Jesus I read about in the Gospels, these people who were being persecuted for their sexuality WERE my family. The children who were killing themselves because the world (and the church in particular) would not accept them WERE my children. And I thought that being a Christian required me to love them, to ache for them, to fight for them with the same urgency I would have if I were fighting for myself. The fact that I had never met them before was completely inconsequential, according to Jesus. \n \n I have these new friends named Laura and Jaime\u2026they\u2019re gay and married. They love each other very much. I recently looked through their photos and noticed that their wedding looked a lot like mine. Actually, their lives look a lot like mine, except that their son, Simon, is very sick with a heart condition. So I\u2019m not sure they really give a rat\u2019s ass right now if Christians \u201caccept\u201d them or call their love for each other \u201csinful\u201d or not because they are quite busy caring for each other and Simon and running between hospitals and home and having a brutiful life together. But I\u2019m glad they slowed down enough to know me, because my life is better with them in it. I love them, and I love Simon. \n \n The following exerpt is based on one of my favorite passages from Huckleberry Finn, and I think it sums up the decision I\u2019ve made about Laura and Jaime\u2019s family. \n \n \u201cWhenever I think of the word \u201cempathy,\u201d I think of a small boy named Huckleberry Finn contemplating his friend and runaway slave, Jim. Huck asks himself whether he should give Jim up or not. Huck was told in Sunday school that people who let slaves go free go to everlasting fire.\u201d But then, Huck says he imagines he and Jim in \u201cthe day and nighttime, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing.\u201d Huck remembers Jim and their friendship and warmth. He imagines Jim not as a slave but as a human being and he decided that, \u201calright, then, I\u2019ll go to hell.\u201d \u2013 This I Believe, 172 \n \n When I say things like this my Christian friends get very alarmed. They say to me: Aren\u2019t you afraid of saying and writing these things? Aren\u2019t you afraid of God? \n \n Well, yes. But when I consider discussing all of these things over with Jesus one day, when I imagine telling Him what I thought I heard Him saying to me, when I explain how my heart understood His message, I realize that I\u2019d be much more afraid to stand in front of Him if I didn\u2019t write these things. I know my Jesus, I love Him, and I think if he needed me to believe that homosexuality was a sin, He would have mentioned it. He didn\u2019t. When Jesus said that marriage was between a man and a woman, he was responding to a question about divorce, not sexuality.* And even the Gospels\u2026 well, even though they are gospel to me, I accept that they are also interpretations of what Jesus said and did and meant -we don\u2019t have a single written word directly from Jesus. He could have left us something \u2013 he could have left another list of rights and wrongs when He came to Earth, but he chose not to. The only words he ever wrote were in the sand. . . words that He knew would disappear almost immediately. Why? I don\u2019t know. Maybe He wanted us to know him well enough to make our decisions about Him based on our relationship with Him. Maybe He wanted us to wrestle with Him, to work out our own faith with fear and trembling. That\u2019s what I think, anyway. I think I\u2019m starting to recognize His still, small voice. And I\u2019m betting everything on my belief in our relationship, on my understanding of His character and love. Aren\u2019t we all? And if I\u2019m wrong, and I very well could be . . . I don\u2019t really think He\u2019ll send me to hell for it. I think He knows I\u2019m doing the best I can down here. I know He knows that. I believe. \n \n And while we\u2019re at it . . . that still, small voice suggests to me often that He\u2019d appreciate if Christians picked up a couple more issues other than homosexuality and abortion to address. You know, maybe a couple He actually mentioned\u2026like care for the poor and sick and lonely and hungry and imprisoned and widowed and orphaned and recently immigrated. Maybe we should all be required to pick an issue that requires US to change and not OTHERS to change. I think that\u2019d be good. \n \n I just think that if we are going to call ourselves pro-life, we must also agree that starvation and poverty and disease and immigration and health care for all and war and peace and the environment are also pro-life issues. And maybe in the meantime we could have a new pro-life bumper sticker made that says: \u201cWe are all Confused Hypocrites. But God Loves Us anyway, which is Good News. So out of Gratitude, We are Trying to Remember That We Belong To Each Other.\u201d I\u2019d buy that one. \n \n My point is that this gay ship has sailed, I think. We\u2019re gonna have to sponsor another revolution because for the gays, the times, they are a\u2019 changing already. Gay people wrote to me by the hundreds to tell me that they read the post again and again, pretending that the letter was from their own parents. Therapists requested my permission to use the letter with their gay and straight clients to teach them about unconditional love. Churches from all over the country asked to use the post in their weekly bulletins. A student at UC Berkley told me that her professor of religious studies distributed the letter to all of his students. I felt very humble about this, which is why I only wear my homemade \u201cTHE RELIGIOUS STUDIES PROFESSOR AT UC BERKLEY DISTRIBUTED MY POST TO ALL HIS STUDENTS\u201d T-shirt to bed. And sometimes to the grocery store, when I\u2019m having an insecure day. \n \n But I also received challenging responses to my post. None were mean-spirited, none were offensive. People are better than we give them credit for. \n \n Many people said that they agree that people are born gay, but that it is still a sin to act on it. These people suggested that homosexuals should remain celibate. \n \n But my understanding is that celibacy is a sacred calling, not a hiding place or a consequence. Celibacy is like\u2026it\u2019s like we all have the same capacity to love inside of us, the same amount of light to shine\u2026\u2026and most of use that light, that love, like a laser\u2026it\u2019s all concentrated and focused on one partner. But the celibate hears a call to use his light, his love, more like a flood light. He knows that if he\u2019s not required to shine a laser on one person, that his light can be dispersed to many more\u2026.maybe not burning a hole into another heart, but lighting up entire rooms. He can reach more people with his love through celibacy because it\u2019s not all focused on one person. Ghandi felt called to be a flood light instead of a laser\u2026and heeded the call to celibacy while he was married. His wife accepted this as the way he was being called to serve his God and his people. And so celibacy\u2026it\u2019s a sacred calling to love. And I fear that when we suggest that homosexuals save themselves by choosing celibacy, that we insult both the gays and the celibates. Celibacy is not a Plan B. \n \n Other Monkees have explained that they believe that homosexuality is a sin, but no more of a sin than pride and anger and selfishness. And since we are all sinners too, we shouldn\u2019t judge the gays. Hate the sin, love the sinner type thing. I don\u2019t know. I guess I have just always accepted the fact that we are put on this Earth to love. To Love God and love our neighbors. And those sins, pride, anger, and selfishness\u2026those sins get in the way of loving God and loving our neighbors. So we should fight them tooth and nail. We should fight them to the death. But homosexuality\u2026I can\u2019t see how a woman sharing her God given light with another woman interferes with her Loving Her God and Loving Her Neighbor. \n \n Unless we come back to: because it says so in the Bible. And we have faith that our understanding of the Bible is infallible. We believe that our human minds can grasp the meaning of all scripture perfectly and so we have faith that homosexuality is a sin. \n \n But you know what the Bible also says? The Bible says \u201cAnd these three remain. Hope, Faith, and Love. And the greatest of these is love.\u201d *** \n \n There will come a point when hope and faith cease to exist. When the next world is revealed, we will know . . . we won\u2019t need hope or faith anymore. Those two are temporary. Hope and faith exist only to help us make it though this life. \n \n But LOVE. Love is eternal. Love never ends. The love we offer and receive in this world we\u2019ll carry with us into the next. The greatest of these is love. When in doubt, I choose love above any particular ideas offered to me about faith. \n \n And that means that I love my gay friends, without agenda. And I love my friends who believe that homosexuality is a sin, without agenda. And I love my friends who are terrified for my soul when I write this way, without agenda. \n \n Because listen \u2013 here\u2019s the thing. After my wrestling match with God, I wasn\u2019t really exhausted enough. I still came up swinging. For a little while, I felt angry. Angry at anyone who had a different understanding of scripture than I did. Angry at people who taught that God disapproved of homosexuality. Prideful about my position, really. And then one day God sat my butt down with the Bible again. \n \n And he said something to me like, \u201cWait a minute, Lovie. Yes, I love those gays, but I love the ones picketing against them every bit as much. That\u2019s the point.\u201d \n \n And There\u2019s the rub. There\u2019s Christianity. It\u2019s not deciding that one group shouldn\u2019t be judged and then turning around and judging the other group. That is not being a peacemaker. Peacemakers resist categorizing people. They find the light, the good, in each and every person. They don\u2019t try to change people, except by example. They know everyone has something important to teach. They are humble about their ideas and their opinions. They try to find common ground, always. \n \n I now have friends who are gay and friends who preach against homosexuality. I have friends who are ministers and friends who are atheists. Listen, I even have a new friend who is a Dallas Cowboys fan. With God, all things are possible. \n \n The point is \u2013 if you\u2019re hungry \u2013 you are all welcome at my table. None of you is less welcome than the other. This place is a banquet table for gays and straights and prudes and hoochies and cheerleaders and tuba players and pharisees and alpha moms and slacker moms and tax collectors and fishermen and choir girls and heathens. It\u2019s a banquet table where people who are different can come together and share a meal and maybe not change each other\u2019s minds, but possibly soften each other\u2019s hearts. \n \n Oh, yes\u2026we can do that. We already have. \n \n You do not have to agree with me to love me. \n \n So at this table, this Momastery table . . . we talk to each other in soft voices, and we smile and we say, \u201cpass the wine, please,\u201d and we ask about each other\u2019s children. Sometimes we even pass around some pictures. We share our families with each other. And we also share some of those magical laughs when we can\u2019t speak and the tears are rolling and we\u2019re gasping for breath and our stomachs hurt like we just did a hundred crunches. Maybe we even pee a little. And maybe in the middle of all that, we start knowing each other as people instead of categories. And we accept that we are different, and we understand that each person\u2019s choices are her own, and so we don\u2019t have to be angry with each other. We are free to love each other. \n \n She told me that once she forgot herself and her heart opened up like a door with a loose latch and everything fell out and she tried for days to put it all back in the proper order, but she finally gave up and left if there in a pile and loved everything equally.- Brian Andreas \n \n Love, \n \n G \n \n *Mark 10, **John 8, ***1 Corinthians 13 \n \n \n \n",

U.S. payrolls rose 74,000 last month, the smallest rise in three years, while the unemployment rate dropped to 6.7%, Labor said Friday. Here are highlights: \n \n Revisions: Employment gains for November and October were revised upward by a total of 38,000. Employers added 241,000 jobs in November, up from an initially reported 203,000. October\u2019s gain was unrevised at 200,000. \n \n Jobless Rate: The December unemployment rate decreased to 6.7%, from 7.0% the prior month, but that was because more people dropped out of the workforce rather than found new jobs. \n \n Yearly Figures: For 2013, employers added an average of 182,000 jobs each month. That is roughly in line with 2012, when payrolls expanded by about 183,000 positions each month. \n \n Participation Rate: The December civilian labor force participation rate was 62.8%, weaker from a month earlier. It is also down from 63.6% in December 2012. \n \n Longer-run Trend: December\u2019s mild advance held back longer-term averages. Monthly job gains averaged 172,000 over the past three months, which was in line as well with the six-month trend. For the first half of 2013, payrolls expanded by 195,000 each month. \n \n Winners: In December, employment rose in the retail sector, which added 55,000 new jobs. Other strong gains came from the wholesale trade industry (15,000) and professional and business services (19,000). \n \n Losers: But employment in the construction sector was down by 16,000. Some economists had predicted before the report that colder weather could be to blame. The federal government\u2019s workforce continued to shrink, with 7,000 fewer positions last month from November. \n \n Earnings and Work Week: The average work week for private employees edged down to 34.4 hours last month from the prior month. Meanwhile, average hourly earnings for private employees rose by 2 cents to $24.17 from a month earlier. Over the year, average hourly earnings have risen by 42 cents. ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 U.S. employers added a scant 74,000 jobs in December, the fewest in three years. The disappointing gain ends 2013 on a weak note after recent economic reports had raised hopes for a strong finish. \n \n The Labor Department says the unemployment rate fell from 7 percent in November to 6.7 percent, the lowest level since October 2008. But the drop occurred partly because more Americans stopped looking for jobs. The government counts people as unemployed only if they are actively searching for work. \n \n Cold weather may have slowed hiring. Construction firms cut 16,000 jobs, the biggest drop in 20 months. \n \n December's hiring is far below the average gain of 214,000 jobs a month in the preceding four months. But monthly gains averaged 182,000 last year, nearly matching the previous two years.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A pretty dismal number on today's jobs report: Just 74,000 jobs were created in December, the smallest monthly increase in three years; economists had expected 200,000. And while the unemployment rate fell to 6.7% from 7.0%, it was \"for all the wrong reasons,\" writes Steven Russolillo at the Wall Street Journal. Specifically, the big drop can be explained by the fact that the participation rate fell to a new low of 62.8%, meaning fewer people were looking for work. The AP reports that cold weather could have played a role in the poor numbers, noting that construction firms cut 16,000 jobs\u2014the largest drop in 20 months. One silver lining from the report: November's new jobs were revised upward to 241,000 from 203,000. And Russolillo writes that the same could happen here. \"Something doesn\u2019t smell right. This jobs number is so far out of whack from the recent economic data that have come out. Jobs data have been getting stronger for months, not to mention improvements in growth, housing, and manufacturing figures. Don't be surprised if this report gets revised higher in the coming months.\"",

(WOOD) \u2014 A man arrested and held in jail for 129 days before he was cleared on sexual assault charges is suing the City of Grand Rapids and three members of the police department. \n \n The lawsuit claims police targeted a man and refused to release him even after they had proof he was not their suspect. \n \n The 24-page complaint filed in Grand Rapids Federal Court Friday details what Xavier Davis says were violations of his rights that include unlawful imprisonment, arrest and prosecution. \n \n In January, Davis was featured in media stories when he was arrested for a publicized sexual assault in Grand Rapids \n \n \u201cIt was all over social media, Internet,\u201d said Davis \n \n A Grand Rapids woman said she was the victim of a sexual assault at gunpoint around 1:30 a.m. on Dec. 28 in the 4200 block of Oak Park Drive SE. \n \n Police put out a sketch looking for tips and say the victim identified Davis from a photo lineup, which was enough to lead police to arrest Davis as he was at the bus station on Jan. 14. \n \n \u201cThe worst part for me, I think, is still reliving, I have dreams and stuff, of how the arrest went down at the bus station,\u201d Davis said. \n \n In January, Davis strongly denied the charges, saying he was nowhere near where the assault occurred. \n \n \u201cHey, what are you guys gonna do when you realize you\u2019ve messed up? Basically telling them on-camera in the interrogation that you guys are gonna be sued after this if you don\u2019t fix this,\u201d Davis told police during his interrogation. \n \n Davis had a criminal past that included time in prison in 2012 for a home invasion and three months in jail in 2015 for a window peeping charge. \n \n Xavier would remain in jail through May, even as evidence came in in March that included cell phone and Uber records that indicated he was not at the scene, and DNA tests showed it was someone else\u2019s DNA evidence at the scene. \n \n \u201cWhen they had what\u2019s called exculpatory evidence, they sat on it.

Once it is, it has 21 days to respond. ||||| GRAND RAPIDS, MI - A man accused of sexually assaulting two women, including one at gunpoint, has filed a federal lawsuit after DNA evidence failed to link him to the crimes. \n \n Xavier Jajuan Davis of Grand Rapids contends he was suspected based on a police sketch that he says bears little resemblance to him. \n \n \"I'm telling them, 'You have the wrong person. There's gotta be a mistake. You guys are making a mistake,'\" Davis, 32, told MLive/The Grand Rapids Press. \n \n \"For whatever reason, they decided Xavier Davis was the guy,\" his attorney, Mark Linton said. \n \n \"They just seemed to have it out for him.\" \n \n Charges dropped against man accused of sexually assaulting woman at gunpoint \n \n The Police Department said: \"As is the case with any lawsuit against the police department or an officer acting in the capacity of his or her duties, all inquiries will be forwarded to the City Attorney's Office.\" \n \n The city has not yet been served with the lawsuit, Assistant City Attorney Kristen Rewa said. \n \n Davis is suing the city and three investigators. \n \n He said he was under investigation, but not charged, in a burglary and arson when he was arrested for the gunpoint rape. He contends police convinced the woman that he was responsible based on a police sketch. \n \n He says that investigators learned beginning in February that Davis was not in the area of the armed sex assault and that DNA tests excluded him as the suspect. Phone records and Uber records also supported his case, he said. He was released from jail, and placed on electronic tether, on May 22. \n \n \"Defendants knew or should have known that there was not probable cause to arrest and charge Mr. Davis, causing him to be held in jail for 129 days and then placed on a tether for another 61 days,\" Linton wrote in the lawsuit. \n \n \"The actions of Defendants in light of this knowledge were extreme and outrageous.\" \n \n Once he got out of jail, Davis was evicted from his rental home and lost jobs at DeVos Place and The B.O.B., he said. \n \n Charges were dropped just as Davis was set for trial July 23 in Kent County Circuit Court. \n \n Kent County Prosecutor Chris Becker said \"witness issues\" and a lack of a DNA match led to the dismissal in the case involving the gun. An unrelated sex-assault case was also dropped. \n \n Davis says he became a suspect in the sex assault in 2017 after he complained to city officials that he was unfairly targeted in the burglary and arson. He said he was at work when the crimes occurred. \n \n He said Detective Adam Bayliss was upset and told him he was only doing his job. \n \n Lt. Kristen Rogers then told Davis that the burglary and arson cases had been closed, the lawsuit said. Detective Kevin Snyder, however, suggested to Rogers that police obtain a DNA sample from Davis to determine if it matched evidence found at the rape scene, the lawsuit said. \n \n Davis had been in trouble before. He was sentenced in 2012 to 15 months in prison for attempted home invasion and has twice been convicted of window peeping. \n \n On Jan. 14, Davis was arrested by U.S. Marshals at the Greyhound bus station. He was told he was arrested for multiple sex-assault charges. Detectives questioned him and obtained a DNA sample. \n \n Linton said that the \"primary basis for having Mr. Davis publicly arrested was that the officers compared his picture to a sketch draft based on a description (by) the victim in a rape case ... .\" \n \n He said that the victim could not identify her attacker but after suggestions by police agreed that it could have been Davis. The victim in that case was raped during the early morning Dec. 28 in her parked car on Kalamazoo Avenue SE. \n \n At his Jan. 17 arraignment, Davis was also charged with an unrelated sexual assault that happened at DeVos Place. The victim told police that a worker sexually assaulted her in a utility room, the lawsuit said. \n \n Davis was suspected after a detective recalled that Davis worked at DeVos Place. But Davis started working there a month after the assault was reported, his attorney said. \n \n The lawsuit contends that Snyder \"unduly coerced\" the victim in the DeVos Place to agree it was possible Davis committed the assault. \n \n \"Despite having clear exculpatory evidence for the rape case dating back to February of 2018, the charges against Mr. Davis were not dismissed until July 23, 2018,\" Linton wrote in the lawsuit. \n \n Davis, once held on $400,000 bond, was assaulted at the Kent County Jail shortly after his arrest and put into a one-man cell for his safety, the lawsuit said. \n \n His case was reported in local media. His booking photo and the police sketch were put on Grand Rapids Police Department's Facebook page, the lawsuit said. \n \n Allegations in the lawsuit include malicious prosecution, defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress and false imprisonment.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 \"For whatever reason, they decided Xavier Davis was the guy.\" That from the lawyer for 31-year-old Davis, arrested in January as the suspect in a sexual assault in Grand Rapids, Mich. The problem: DNA evidence and Uber and phone records showed Davis wasn't the guy, and charges against him were dropped in July, per MLive.com. Before that, though, he was in prison for 129 days, then attached to an e-tether for two months, and now he's suing the City of Grand Rapids and three cops for false imprisonment and defamation, among other allegations, per WOOD. \"I'm telling them, 'You have the wrong person,'\" Davis says of his arrest, which he says was based on a sketch that doesn't even look like him; WZZM has a picture of it. It gets a bit complicated: Davis was already under investigation for a burglary and arson when he was arrested for the rape of a woman in her car in late December. At his January arraignment, Davis\u2014who was sent to prison for more than a year in 2012 for a home invasion and also has been convicted of window peeping\u2014was then charged with another sexual assault at his workplace, though his lawyer says he started working there after the assault report. In both cases, Davis contends police led the victims to believe he was their attacker, and that even after the DNA and other evidence started to surface in February showing he wasn't in the car case, he was still incarcerated for months. He also says his face and name were plastered everywhere after his arrest, and he lost his two jobs and was evicted from his home after he got out of jail, per WOOD. He said he told cops during his initial questioning: \"You guys are gonna be sued after this if you don't fix this.\" Charges in both cases were dropped, and WOOD notes Davis has since secured a new job and place to live.

    "document": "Russian special forces rappelled onto a disabled oil tanker taken over by Somali pirates, freeing 23 Russian sailors and arresting the pirates during a dawn raid Thursday, the commander of the EU Naval Force said. \n \n The raid against the Liberian-flagged ship Moscow University came 24 hours after pirates had taken the ship over and the crew locked itself in a safe room. The vessel is carrying 86,000 tons of crude oil worth about $50 million. \n \n The special forces had been aboard the Russian anti-submarine destroyer Marshal Shaposhnikov, which rushed to the scene after Wednesday's attack. The special forces boarded a helicopter and rappelled down to the Moscow University, Rear Adm. Jan Thornqvist, force commander of the EU Naval Force, told The Associated Press. \n \n Shots were fired during the raid but no one was injured, Thornqvist said. \n \n Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Col. Alexei Kuznetsov said the pirates are being held aboard the tanker. Russian news agencies reported the death of one pirate during the raid, but Kuznetsov told AP that information was still being looked into. \n \n The crew of the Moscow University had previously told officials they believed the pirates were trying to enter the engine room, Thornqvist said. The ship had been disabled and was not moving. Safe rooms, where crews seek shelter, are typically stocked with food, water and communications equipment and have reinforced doors that can only be opened from the inside. \n \n The ship's owner, Novoship, said in a statement that the decision to free the ship was made knowing \"that the crew was under safe cover inaccessible to the pirates and that the lives and health of the sailors was not threatened by anything.\" \n \n Cmdr. John Harbour, a spokesman for the EU Naval Force, called the rescue \"an excellent operation all around.\" He said the EU Naval Force had been working at a tactical level with the Russians, and that EU Naval Force personnel talked to the Russian crew by VHF radio. He said the EU had offered support to the Russians. \n \n The attack occurred about 500 miles (800 kilometers) east of the Somali coast. The ship was not registered with the Maritime Security Center, said Harbour. The ship's route was from the Red Sea to China, the ship's owner said. \n \n Novoship is a subsidiary of Sovcomflot, which is owned by the Russian government. \n \n The fact that Russian special forces stormed the Moscow University shortly after it was taken over is in line with a trend by international military forces who are more aggressively combating piracy. \n \n In February, Danish special forces prevented the hijacking of a ship after pirates had boarded it. Special forces from the Danish Absalon boarded the Ariella while the crew locked themselves in a secure room. \n \n EU Naval Force ships are disrupting pirate groups and destroying their ships at a much higher rate than in previous years. U.S. warships have fired back on pirates and destroyed their boats in several skirmishes in the last several weeks. \n \n Pirates currently hold more than 300 hostages taken from ships attacked off East Africa in the last several months. Eleven suspected Somali pirates were indicted in U.S. federal court late last month, but the international community has had problems formulating an accepted policy to try and jail pirate suspects. \n \n Along with the increased pressure by international navies against pirates has come some criticism. \n \n On Wednesday, a French prosecutor said a French rescuer was responsible for killing the skipper of a sailboat hijacked by Somali pirates during a rescue operation. \n \n Chief prosecutor Hever Pavy in the western French city of Rennes said investigators found a French military bullet had killed Florent Lemacon in April 2009 when a special intervention team came to rescue his yacht, the Tanit, off the Somali coast. \n \n Four other hostages were saved after a week on the hijacked ship. Three suspected pirates who survived the rescue operation are on trial in France. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press reporters Jason Straziuso in Nairobi, Kenya and Jim Heintz in Moscow contributed to this report. ||||| MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian forces freed a hijacked Russian oil tanker in a helicopter-backed operation on Thursday, rescuing its crew and, according to one report, killing a Somali pirate. \n \n Pirates on Wednesday hijacked the MV Moscow University in the Gulf of Aden with its 23-member crew and a cargo of crude oil worth $52 million. \n \n The European Union\u2019s naval force said the Russian warship Marshal Shaposhnikov had sent in a helicopter that returned fire after being shot at by pirates. \n \n \u201cEventually the pirates surrendered and a boarding team from the Marshal Shaposhnikov arrived on board the tanker, captured all the pirates and freed the crew. All the crew are safe and well,\u201d and EU naval statement said. \n \n However the state-run RIA news agency, citing an unnamed Russian navy official, said the Russians had killed one pirate and captured 10. \n \n A spokesman for Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry, Igor Lyakin-Frolov, confirmed that some pirates had been captured, but said it was unclear if there were casualties among them. \n \n \u201cThe captured pirates will most likely be handed over to the authorities of countries in the region,\u201d he told Reuters. \n \n The tanker would most likely continue on its planned voyage to China, he said. \n \n Somali pirates are still able to seize ships despite the presence of an international fleet of warships in the busy shipping lanes linking Europe with Asia.

Thousands of Palestinians are protesting near Gaza's border with Israel, as Israel prepared for the festive inauguration of a new U.S. Embassy in contested Jerusalem. (AP Photo/Khalil Hamra) (Associated Press) \n \n GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) \u2014 Thousands of Palestinian protesters converged along the border with Israel on Monday, drawing Israeli fire that killed at least 16 people in the bloodiest day of weeks of demonstrations and casting a cloud over Israel's festive inauguration of the new U.S. Embassy in contested Jerusalem. \n \n With their anger fueled by the embassy opening, protesters set tires on fire, sending thick plumes of black smoke into the air at several spots along the border, while the Israeli military said protesters assaulted the border fence. By midafternoon, at least 16 Palestinians, including a 14-year-old boy, were killed while over 500 were wounded by Israeli fire, Palestinian health officials said. \n \n In the West Bank, several thousand people gathered in the center of Ramallah, while hundreds marched to the Qalandiya crossing on the outskirts of Jerusalem, where protesters threw stones at Israeli troops. \n \n The protest in Gaza was to be the biggest yet in a weekslong campaign against a decade-old blockade of the territory. The march was also directed at the inauguration of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem later Monday. The relocation of the embassy from Tel Aviv, a key campaign promise of President Donald Trump, has infuriated the Palestinians, who seek east Jerusalem as a future capital. \n \n \"A great day for Israel,\" Trump tweeted early Monday. \n \n Monday marked the biggest showdown in recent weeks between Israel's military and Gaza's Hamas rulers along the volatile border. \n \n It is the culmination of a campaign, led by the Islamic militant Hamas and fueled by despair among Gaza's 2 million people, to break the decade-old border blockade of the territory by Israel and Egypt. Since weekly border marches began in late March, 58 Palestinian protesters have been killed and more than 2,300 wounded by Israeli army fire. \n \n Hamas leaders have suggested a border breach is possible Monday, while Israel has warned it would prevent protesters from breaking through the barrier at any cost. \n \n Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, an Israeli military spokesman, said the army had bolstered its front-line forces along the border, but also set up additional \"layers\" of security in and around neighboring communities to defend Israeli civilians in case of a mass breach. He said there already had been several \"significant attempts\" to break through the fence. \n \n \"Even if the fence is breached, we will be able to protect Israeli civilians from attempts to massacre or kidnap or kill them,\" he said. \n \n The timing of Monday's events was deeply symbolic, both to Israel and the Palestinians. \n \n The U.S. said it chose the date to coincide with the 70th anniversary of Israel's establishment. \n \n But it also marks the anniversary of what Palestinians call their \"nakba,\" or catastrophe, a reference to the uprooting of hundreds of thousands who fled or were expelled from what is now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding Israel's independence. \n \n A majority of Gaza's 2 million people are descendants of refugees, and the protests have been billed as the \"Great March of Return\" to long-lost homes in what is now Israel. \n \n In one of the border areas east of Gaza City, Mohammed Hamami, a 40-year-old civil servant, joined a crowd of hundreds of protesters, along with his mother and five children. \n \n \"Today we are here to send a message to Israel and its allies that we will never give up on our land,\" he said. \n \n \"We will cross the border and impose new realities like the reality Trump imposed in Jerusalem,\" he added, referring to President Donald Trump's decision in December to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and then move the U.S. Embassy there. \n \n Some protesters moved to within about 150 meters (yards) of the border fence. A reporter saw two men who tried to advance further being shot in the legs by Israeli troops. \n \n Clouds of black smoke from burning tires rose into the air. Earlier Monday, Israeli drones dropping incendiary material had pre-emptively set ablaze some of the tires collected in advance by activists. \n \n Protesters have used the thick smoke as cover against Israeli snipers perched on high sand berms on the other side of the border. The army accuses Hamas of using the protests as cover to plan or carry out attacks. \n \n Leaflets dropped over Gaza by army jets warned that those approaching the border \"jeopardize\" their lives. The warning said the army is \"prepared to face all scenarios and will act against every attempt to damage the security fence or harm IDF soldiers or Israeli civilians.\" \n \n In Jerusalem, top Trump administration officials attended events linked to the inauguration of the embassy later Monday. \n \n Speaking at a celebration hosted by the Orthodox Union, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that it was a U.S. \"national security priority\" to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. \n \n Trump's decision to go forward with a campaign promise to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem was welcomed by Israel and condemned by the Palestinians. Previous presidents had signed a waiver postponing the move, citing national security. \n \n Israel captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed it in a move not recognized by the international community. The Palestinians seek the city's eastern half as the capital of a future state. \n \n Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas cut ties with the Trump administration and declared it unfit to remain in its role as the sole mediator in peace talks. \n \n Saeb Erekat, a senior Abbas aide, blasted the Trump administration Monday, saying Trump had violated a promise to hold off on moving the embassy to give peace talks a chance and that his administration is \"based on lies.\" \n \n Erekat said the Trump administration has \"become part of the problem, not part of the solution.\" \n \n Administration officials have dismissed Palestinian criticism, portraying the embassy opening as an essential step toward an eventual Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. However, they have not said how they will move forward without the Palestinians. \n \n Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Trump's \"bold decision\" in upending decades of U.S. policy by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \"It's the right thing to do,\" a smiling Netanyahu told the jubilant crowd at a reception in Jerusalem late Sunday. \n \n Although Trump has said his declaration does not set the final borders of the city, his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital has been perceived by both Israel and the Palestinians as taking Israel's side in the most sensitive issue in their conflict. \n \n Only two countries, Guatemala and Paraguay, have said they will follow suit. Most of the world maintains embassies in Tel Aviv, saying the Jerusalem issue must first be resolved. \n \n In a reflection of the deep sensitivities, dozens of countries \u2014 including Britain, France and Germany \u2014 skipped a celebration Sunday night at the Israeli Foreign Ministry. \n \n Monday's opening will be attended by Trump's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who both serve as White House advisers. Kushner leads the Trump Mideast team. \n \n __ \n \n Ben Zion reported from Jerusalem.

Many came to peacefully demonstrate, bringing their children and carrying flags. Food stalls sold snacks and music blared. \n \n But the protests appeared to have a more violent edge than in previous weeks. Some young men brought knives and fence cutters. At a gathering point east of Gaza City, organizers urged protesters over loudspeakers to burst through the fence, telling them Israeli soldiers were fleeing their positions, even as they were reinforcing them. \n \n Israeli snipers were determined not to allow a breach, and ambulances soon began screaming back and forth from the fence as gunshots rang out. No Israeli soldiers were injured, though, and Israel drew widespread condemnation for an excessive use of force. \n \n More than 2,700 people were injured, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza, including 1,359 from live ammunition. The dead included six children under the age of 18, among them a 15-year-old girl, and a medic, the ministry said. \n \n 1 of 30 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Gaza protests turn deadly as U.S. Embassy opens in Jerusalem View Photos Israeli soldiers killed dozens of Palestinians demonstrating along the border fence and wounded more than 1,600 in the bloodiest day in Gaza since the 2014 war with Israel.

(Dusan Vranic/AP) \n \n Increasing economic hardship has fueled frustrations in Gaza, along with wider despair across Palestinian territories amid moves by a U.S. administration seen as wholeheartedly on Israel\u2019s side in the decades-old conflict. \n \n At least 110 Gazans have been killed over the past six weeks, according to Gaza Health Ministry figures. \n \n At the demonstrations east of Gaza City, some said the force used by Israel would only bring further unrest. \n \n Standing a few hundred meters from the fence, Nirma Attalah, 29, said her 22-year-old brother had been killed two weeks ago. \u201cMy brother was shot in the head in this place,\u201d she said. She had come on Monday with her whole extended family. \u201cWe are here for Jerusalem, for Palestinian land,\u201d she said. \n \n A truck rolled past carrying young men chanting: \u201cTo Jerusalem we go with millions of martyrs\u201d and \u201cDeath rather than humiliation.\u201d \n \n Drones dropped canisters of tear gas, sending crowds fleeing. Other drones dropped leaflets that urged demonstrators to say back from the fence. \n \n \u201cPeople have come out of the rubble to say we will not forget our rights,\u201d said Yousef Abu Saleh, 25. \u201cThe American administration is adopting the Israeli story and stealing our right of return.\u201d \n \n While some said they would abide by official calls to keep the demonstrations peaceful, others talked about their enthusiasm to break into Israel and wreak havoc. \n \n \u201cWe are excited to storm and get inside,\u201d said 23-year-old Mohammed Mansoura. When asked what he would do inside Israel, he said, \u201cWhatever is possible, to kill, throw stones.\u201d \n \n Two other young men carried large knives and said they wanted to kill Jews on the other side of the fence. \n \n The Israeli military brought two extra brigades to the Gaza border in preparation for the demonstrations and added additional \u201cdefense lines\u201d in an effort to prevent any mass invasion into Israeli communities near the border. \n \n The military said at least 40,000 people protested in 13 places along the fence \u2014 more than twice as many locations as in past weeks of protest. \n \n \u201cEspecially violent riots\u201d took place near the southern Gazan city of Rafah, where three people were killed after trying to plant an explosive, the military added. The military also said it would \u201cact forcefully against any terrorist activity,\u201d and it carried out an airstrike on Hamas military posts in northern Gaza after Israeli troops came under fire. \n \n At demonstrations near the Bureij Camp in central Gaza, Ahmed Loulou, 22, released a cluster of balloons carrying a Palestinian flag. He had written in marker: \u201cWe are returning. This is our land.\u201d \n \n The load was briefly caught in a power line before bobbing unsteadily toward the border. \n \n Loulou said that it was his first time at the demonstrations and that he had been persuaded to come by friends. \n \n Meanwhile, young men fired stones from slingshots as they sheltered behind earthen berms. Shortly afterward, the sound of live ammunition zinged through the air over the sound of the afternoon call to prayer. \n \n \u201cSniper!

He let off a stream of bullets into the air and brought it down. Later, more gunfire was heard as Palestinian factions argued over who would keep the downed drown, onlookers said. \n \n As the death toll neared 50, loudspeakers called for protesters to leave the border area. Hamas leader Ismail Haniya was called to Cairo on Sunday night in an apparent attempt to persuade the militant group to quell the demonstrations. No agreement was made, Hamas spokesman Taher al-Nounou said as he attended the protests. \u201cThey understood our points. Our people are showing their solidarity with Jerusalem today, and showing their anger with the U.S. administration.\u201d \n \n Hamas\u2019s Interior Ministry said seven of its members were killed, including a medic from the civil defense, two internal security staff and a military intelligence official. At least 12 journalists were injured, according to the Health Ministry. \n \n The demonstrations have proved to be a welcome distraction for Hamas, refocusing anger against Israel as frustration built against the group in Gaza. \n \n At a news conference as evening fell, senior Hamas official Khalil al-Hayaa said the protests would continue. \n \n \u201cThis blood will keep boiling until the occupation leaves forever,\u201d he said. \n \n At a morgue, the blood was washed off the bodies of those killed before they were taken away by waiting relatives.

First, the word \"verify\" more accurately reflects the requirements placed on end users of endangered wood. The Lacey Act, Johnson wrote, \"does not require any 'certification' at all per se. In the forestry world, 'certify' implies independent third-party certification, or government stamps, neither of which the US government recognizes as 'proof' of legality.\" \n \n Johnson also says she mis-spoke when she said that Gibson \"was on the ground in Madagascar getting a tour to understand whether they could possibly source illegally from that country.\" \n \n \"I used 'illegally' when I meant 'legally' in talking about the trip to Madagascar,\" she writes. \"I didn't realize I'd done this until I was listening to the piece. I really wanted to be clear: the objective of that trip's organizers was to look into whether there were opportunities for 'good wood' sourcing, and in the end after seeing the risks, only Gibson continued to purchase.\" \n \n Last week federal marshals raided the Gibson Guitar Corporation in Tennessee. It wasn't the first time. The government appears to be preparing to charge the famous builder of instruments with trafficking in illegally obtained wood. It's a rare collision of music and environmental regulation. \n \n In the hottest part of an August Tennessee day last Thursday, Gibson Guitar CEO Henry Juszkiewicz stood out in the full sun for 30 minutes and vented to the press about the events of the day before. \n \n \"We had a raid,\" he said, \"with federal marshals that were armed, that came in, evacuated our factory, shut down production, sent our employees home and confiscated wood.\" \n \n The raids at two Nashville facilities and one in Memphis recalled a similar raid in Nashville in November 2009, when agents seized a shipment of ebony from Madagascar. They were enforcing the Lacey Act, a century-old endangered species law that was amended in 2008 to include plants as well as animals. But Juszkiewicz says the government won't tell him exactly how \u2014 or if \u2014 his company has violated that law. \n \n \"We're in this really incredible situation. We have been implicated in wrongdoing and we haven't been charged with anything,\" he says. \"Our business has been injured to millions of dollars. And we don't even have a court we can go to and say, 'Look, here's our position.'\" \n \n The U.S. Justice Department won't comment about the case it's preparing, but a court motion filed in June asserts Gibson's Madagascar ebony was contraband. It quotes emails that seem to show Gibson taking steps to maintain a supply chain that's been connected to illegal timber harvests. \n \n Andrea Johnson, director of forest programs for the Environmental Investigation Agency in Washington, says the Lacey Act requires end users of endangered wood to certify the legality of their supply chain all the way to the trees. EIA's independent investigations have concluded that Gibson knowingly imported tainted wood. \n \n \"Gibson clearly understood the risks involved,\" says Johnson. \"Was on the ground in Madagascar getting a tour to understand whether they could possibly source illegally from that country. And made a decision in the end that they were going to source despite knowing that there was a ban on exports of ebony and rosewood.\" \n \n Gibson vigorously denies these allegations, maintaining that all of its purchases from Madagascar have complied with U.S. and Malagasy law. A company attorney says Gibson has presented documents to support that claim and that the recent raid seized legally obtained wood from India. He adds that the company stopped importing wood from Madagascar in 2009. \n \n Chris Martin, Chairman and CEO of the C.F. Martin Guitar Co. in Nazareth, Pa., says that when he first heard guitars built from Madagascar rosewood, he dreamed it might be the long-sought substitute for Brazilian rosewood, whose trade was banned in the 1990s due to over-harvest. Then the situation in Madagascar changed. \n \n \"There was a coup,\" Martin says. \"What we heard was the international community has come to the conclusion that the coup created an illegitimate government. That's when we said, 'Okay, we can not buy any more of this wood.'\" \n \n And while some say the Lacey Act is burdensome, Martin supports it: \"I think it's a wonderful thing. I think illegal logging is appalling. It should stop. And if this is what it takes unfortunately to stop unscrupulous operators, I'm all for it. It's tedious, but we're getting through it.\" \n \n Others in the guitar world aren't so upbeat. Attorney Ronald Bienstock says the Gibson raids have aroused the guitar builders he represents because the Lacey Act is retroactive. He says they're worried they might be forced to prove the provenance of wood they acquired decades ago. \n \n \"There hasn't been that moment where people have quote tested the case. 'What is compliance? What is actual compliance? How have I complied?' We're lacking that.\" \n \n He's even warned clients to be wary of traveling abroad with old guitars, because the law says owners can be asked to account for every wooden part of their guitars when re-entering the U.S. The law also covers the trade in vintage instruments. \n \n Nashville's George Gruhn is one of the world's top dealers of old guitars, banjos and other rare stringed instruments. \"It's a nightmare,\" he says. \"I can't help it if they used Brazilian rosewood on almost every guitar made prior to 1970. I'm not contributing to cutting down Brazilian rosewood today.\" \n \n Gruhn acknowledges that the government has tried to create exemptions to cover vintage instruments. But he says they are rife with delays and to play it safe he's nearly eliminated the 40% of his business that used to deal with overseas buyers. \"This is a new normal,\" says the EIA's Andrea Johnson. \"And it takes getting used to.\" \n \n Johnson defends the Lacey Act and the government's efforts to enforce it. \"Nobody here wants this law to founder on unintended consequences,\" she says. \"Because ultimately everybody understands that the intent here is to reduce illegal logging and send a signal to the markets that you've got to be asking questions and sourcing wood in a responsible way.\" \n \n What constitutes that responsible way may only become clear when the government finally charges Gibson and the company gets the day in court it says it wants so badly. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Allegations of illegal wood imports prompted the Justice Department to raid Gibson Guitar facilities in Tennessee last week. NPR aired the complicated story involving the 100-year old Lacey Act, which prohibits imports of endangered species, including plants, into the US. No formal charges have been pressed, but it appears the issue lies with Gibson possibly importing banned Madagascar ebony. Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India. Adding some gusto to the story, right-leaning sites assert that Gibson rival CF Martin uses the same wood in some of its guitars, but the company was never investigated. The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer. Raising the octave even higher, it is possible Michelle Obama ran afoul of the Lacey Act when she presented France's Carla Bruni with a Gibson guitar that may have contained banned wood. However the story plays out, many are frustrated with the retroactive aspect of the law. \"It's a nightmare,\" says a dealer. \"I can't help it if they used Brazilian rosewood on almost every guitar made prior to 1970.\"",
