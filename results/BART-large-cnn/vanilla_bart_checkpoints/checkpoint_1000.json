The Catholic Church retains a strong influence on society, and the country is one of a handful to ban abortion under any circumstances. \n \n Center-left Bachelet, who is a year into her second term, has introduced reforms, including a bill being debated in Congress that would relax the abortion law. These have angered conservatives. \n \n Bachelet's agenda has not mentioned euthanasia. \n \n (Reporting by Rosalba O'Brien and Fabian Cambero; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Howard Goller) ||||| Story highlights 14-year-old Valentina Maureira suffers from cystic fibrosis \n \n In a video, she asks the President to allow her to have an assisted suicide \n \n (CNN) A Chilean girl's plea via social media for an assisted suicide caught the attention of the person the teen thinks could make it happen: President Michelle Bachelet. \n \n Bachelet visited 14-year-old Valentina Maureira on Saturday after the girl's video went viral and spurred debate in Chile about euthanasia. \n \n Valentina was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis when she was 6. Her older brother died from the same disease. \n \n Cystic fibrosis is a life-threatening disease that damages the lungs and digestive system.

The 14-year-old has the same inherited disease and was told she has a life expectancy of 17, reports CNN. Except Valentina doesn't want to live that long. The Chilean teen posted a now-viral video to Facebook late last month, a plea to President Michelle Bachelet that she be allowed to end her life. \"I am tired of living with this sickness,\" which causes damage to the lungs and digestive system, Valentina explains. \"Please authorize an injection so I can sleep forever.\" But a rep for Bachelet on Thursday explained \"it's impossible to grant her wish\" due to Chilean law, which bars euthanasia and doesn't allow a government official to circumvent that. Still, the president herself, who is also a pediatrician, did visit Valentina for more than an hour last week; the two posed for a selfie. The president's rep explained \"we will provide all the emotional and psychological support and medical treatment to improve her living conditions.\" As for her medical condition, the Universidad Catolica clinic in Santiago describes it as stable and notes she is not facing, as Reuters puts it, any \"immediately life-threatening conditions.\" But her father described a painful existence: \"She has already had five operations ... which have caused her a lot of suffering. It was promised that things would get better, but for her it was worse.\" She suffers from persistent headaches and vomiting as well. In an interview with the AP, he says he \"cried through the night\" after learning what Valentina wanted, \"but I have to respect her decision because she's the one who's suffering this illness.\" (One country has made euthanasia legal for kids.)",

    "document": "Multiple sources tell The Federalist that the New York Times is prepping yet another attack piece on Brett Kavanaugh for his party planning efforts in the 1980s. \n \n Having failed to corroborate any allegations of rape against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, The New York Times is now preparing to smear him for organizing party planning and logistics more than 30 years ago. This comes on the heels of a blockbuster Times report alleging that Kavanaugh might have thrown ice at someone at some point in the 1980s. \n \n The Times is calling around to classmates asking them about a letter Kavanaugh allegedly wrote to a classmate to organize a week at the beach during the 1980s, according to multiple sources. The letter notes the location on the Maryland shore where the classmates planned to stay, the estimated costs for each organizer, and items they should bring with them, such as \u201csheets, pillowcases, blankets, etc.\u201d \n \n The letter noted that a total of eight friends, including Kavanaugh, were \u201cin charge\u201d and that they would each get to have beds to sleep in at the designated rental property and a say in who else was invited. The tongue-in-cheek note, infused with inside jokes, said they should talk to neighbors of the property ahead of time and give them a heads up that a party would be hosted there and that alcohol and obnoxious students would be involved. \n \n \u201cP.S. It would probably be a good idea on Sat. the 18th to warn the neighbors that we\u2019re loud, obnoxious drunks with prolific pukers among us,\u201d the letter said. The note also joked that \u201cthe danger of eviction is great and that would suck because of the money and because this week has big potential.\u201d \n \n The letter noted that each of the eight boys owed an additional $50 to secure the remainder of the costs of the rental property, which totaled $398. Kavanaugh openly discussed needing to maintain order to prevent the festivities from getting out of control. \n \n \u201cIf half of Gonzaga/St. Johns starts coming,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwe might have to give the boot or else we might get it ourselves.\u201d \n \n The letter also made note of their awkwardness with girls, whom the teenage boys very much hoped would join them at the party. \n \n \u201cI think we are unanimous that any girls we can beg to stay there are welcomed with open \u2026\u201d he wrote. \n \n The letter addressed to Patrick \u201cP.J.\u201d Smyth was signed by Kavanaugh as \u201cBart,\u201d which friends say was a nickname P.J. used with him. \n \n \u201cFFFFF, Bart,\u201d the letter closed, using an inside reference to a speech tic of one of the boys\u2019 friends. \n \n Classmates contacted by The Federalist confirm that Kavanaugh organized \u201cBeach Week,\u201d which to this day remains a popular rite of passage in the D.C. metro area for public and private school students alike. The letter was apparently shared with Georgetown Prep alumni years later as an example of the camaraderie and shared hijinks of Kavanaugh and his classmates. One person told The Federalist that the letter was shared as an homage to Kavanaugh, who even then was seen as the most organized individual in a school full of them. \n \n \u201cBrett was very organized, the most organized of everybody. This was his attempt to get people informed about where we were staying,\u201d said one classmate, who described the note as innocuous. He described his friend set as having a good reputation with women at neighboring schools, a view confirmed by many female contemporaries who have signed letters in praise of Kavanaugh. \n \n The friend said Kavanaugh was \u201cone of the most reserved and conservative guys in this group. Did he drink beer? Yes, but absolutely he was one of the most reserved and conservative guys in the whole group.\u201d He expressed disappointment in the Times, which he said couldn\u2019t care less about the truth. \u201cThey have an objective and will do whatever it takes to achieve that objective,\u201d he said. \n \n This isn\u2019t the first attempt by The New York Times to spuriously slime Kavanaugh and his classmates for their high school friendships. As The Federalist previously noted, a Times article scrutinizing inside jokes in the 1983 yearbook of Kavanaugh\u2019s Georgetown Preparatory School hid multiple problems with its claims, including that it was sourced to a rabidly anti-Trump politician in Maryland and his associate. \n \n The article revealed inside jokes about a friend of Kavanaugh and his classmates named Renate Schroeder Dolphin. The classmates were featured in a picture with a caption \u201cRenate Alumnius,\u201d which the Times\u2019 named and anonymous sources argued is a reference to sex. The classmates themselves, however, strenuously insist that the reference was nothing of the kind and that none of the men had sexual relations with the friend. They say that they attended each other\u2019s dances and prep school functions and maintained the friendship throughout the next several decades. \n \n More recently, The New York Times reported that Kavanaugh may or may not have thrown ice in the 1980s in an article reported by Emily Bazelon, an abortion fanatic and virulent critic of Kavanaugh who publicly opposed his confirmation in July. \n \n The Senate is awaiting the completion of a supplemental background check investigation by the FBI before it votes on the confirmation of Kavanaugh to be a Supreme Court justice. ||||| Parties, in the backyards of classmates\u2019 suburban homes when their parents were away, would often attract hundreds of students from nearby private schools, his classmates recall. Five or 10 kegs would be procured and, if all went as planned, drained by the end of the night. \n \n One night during his senior year, according to classmates who witnessed it, Judge Kavanaugh triumphantly hoisted an empty beer keg above his head, in recognition that he and his friends were well on their way to reaching their goal of polishing off 100 kegs during the academic year \u2014 an achievement they later boasted about in their yearbook. \n \n Four Georgetown Prep classmates said they saw Judge Kavanaugh and his friends partake in binge-drinking rituals many weekends in which other partygoers saw them inebriated, even having difficulty standing. Three of those classmates signed a July letter, along with more than 150 other alumni, that endorsed him for the Supreme Court. \n \n Through his lawyers, Judge Kavanaugh declined to comment for this article, other than to say of his letter: \u201cThis is a note I wrote to organize \u2018Beach Week\u2019 in the summer of 1983.\u201d \n \n Kerri Kupec, a White House spokeswoman, said: \u201cIt seems The New York Times is committed to embarrassing Judge Kavanaugh with three-decade-old stories of adolescent drinking.\u201d \n \n Judge Kavanaugh, an only child and sports fanatic, surrounded himself in high school with athletes. Among his closest friends, classmates said, were Mr. Judge, Christopher C. Garrett and Don Urgo Jr. Other members of the clique included Mr. Gaudette and DeLancey Davis. \n \n \u201cAcademically, athletically and socially, we all became literally almost like brothers,\u201d Mr. Urgo said in an interview with The Times in July. He got to know Judge Kavanaugh as a fellow altar boy in elementary school. \u201cWe had a particular esprit de corps, a zest for life, as a group.\u201d",

Passengers and crew jumped to safety before the plane was engulfed in flames. \n \n Passenger Jackeline Flores told reporters the plane crashed shortly after taking off in heavy rain. She and her daughter escaped from a hole in the fuselage as the aircraft filled up with smoke and flames, she said. \n \n \u201cA little girl who left the plane was crying because her legs were burned,\u201d said Flores, who said she was Mexican but lived in Bogota, Colombia. \n \n Flores said her passport and documents burned in the fire. \n \n \u201cI feel blessed and grateful to God,\u201d she said. \n \n TV images showed the severely damaged body of the plane after it came to rest in scrubland and a column of smoke rose into the sky. \n \n The plane had barely taken off when it felt like it was hit by a strong air current, another passenger told network Televisa. \n \n Durango Governor Jos\u00e9 Rosas Aispuro also said a gust of wind rocked the plane before it plunged suddenly, citing air traffic control at the airport. The plane\u2019s left wing hit the ground, knocking off two engines, before it came to a halt 300 meters (328 yards) from the runway, he told a news conference. \n \n Passengers were able to escape on the plane\u2019s emergency slides before it was engulfed in flames, he said. The pilot was the most severely hurt but was in a stable condition. \n \n Grupo Aeroportuario Centro Norte, (OMAB.MX) the airport operator, also attributed the crash to bad weather, citing preliminary reports. \n \n Aeromexico said in a statement: \u201cWe deeply regret this accident.

No one died. \n \n Dozens were injured, Durango state officials said, and it appears that a strong wind brought down Flight 2431. \n \n \"The control tower noticed strong wind currents, and this could have caused the accident,\" Durango Gov. Jose Aispuro said Tuesday night in a news conference. \n \n The plane was en route Tuesday from Durango to Mexico City when it rapidly descended after takeoff, airline and state officials said. \n \n Rescue crews flock to the remains of the airplane just beyond the runway. \n \n The left wing of the twin-engine jet initially touched the ground, causing the plane to lose both engines. The plane then skidded off the runway at General Guadalupe Victoria International Airport, stopping about 300 meters (1,000 feet) away, Aispuro said. \n \n Read More",

The Aerom\u00e9xico flight went down shortly after taking off in Durango, bound for Mexico City. The BBC reports a gust of wind may have been a major contributing factor, causing the plane to plunge. The left wing scraped the ground and two engines tore off, with Reuters reporting the plane came to rest about 1,000 feet from the runway. The plane then caught fire, but most were able to exit it before that occurred. A young girl who was burned is one of two seriously injured people, with the pilot being the other. Reports on how many were injured in total range from \"dozens\" to 97. Passengers describe the crash to the AFP and CNN, which reports the crew was able to activate the evacuation slides. \"The second impact was a lot stronger. This is when I jumped and hit my head against the ceiling. After the second impact, I saw flames in the cabin ahead of me.\" \"When we were already aloft, up high, it felt like the plane was going to level out but just then it plunged to the ground. I think we fell back on the runway because it was a hard surface, then we skidded on the ground until it stopped. I undid my seatbelt and saw flames, and realized we had to jump. There was a hole right next to us where the plane had broken up. I told my girl, 'We have to jump over here', and we jumped.\"",

The pic has been shooting in London. \n \n In announcing the shutdown last week, producers Fox, New Regency and Graham King initially said filming was being suspended because of Singer's \"unexpected unavailability.\" \n \n Denying he acted unprofessionally, Singer claimed the studio refused to allow him to tend to \"a gravely ill parent\" as well as to his own health. \u201cI wanted nothing more than to be able to finish this project and help honor the legacy of Freddie Mercury and Queen,\" he said in a statement, \"but Fox would not permit me to do so because I needed to temporarily put my health, and the health of my loved ones, first.\u201d \n \n Trouble began when Singer went missing during production on several occasions. His no-shows resulted in cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel having to step in to helm some of the days while Singer was absent. \n \n Tom Hollander, who plays Queen manager Jim Beach, also is said to have briefly quit the film because of Singer's behavior, but was persuaded to return, according to one source. \n \n Malek complained to the studio, charging Singer with not being present on set, unreliability and unprofessionalism. \n \n Singer had been warned before production began by both Fox Film chairman and CEO Stacey Snider and Fox Film vice chairman and president of production Emma Watts that they wouldn't tolerate any unprofessional behavior on his part. A representative from the Directors Guild of America also arrived on set to monitor the situation. \n \n The growing tension led to a confrontation between Singer and Malek, which, while it did not become physical, did involve Singer throwing an object. Subsequently, however, the two are said to have settled their differences and filming was expected to resume. \n \n But then Singer did not return to the set after the Thanksgiving break and is believed to have been in the U.S. for about the last 10 days, according to one source. In his absence, Sigel stepped in to helm several days of shooting before the production was shut down. Singer's prolonged absence was the final straw, and so the studio decided to terminate him under his pay-or-play contract. \n \n According to another insider, Singer has claimed he is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder because of the tensions on the set. \n \n In his statement, Singer said, \"\u201cRumors that my unexpected departure from the film was sparked by a dispute I had with Rami Malek are not true. While, at times, we did have creative differences on set, Rami and I successfully put those differences behind us and continued to work on the film together until just prior to Thanksgiving.\u201d \n \n The studio, which has about two more weeks of principal photography remaining on the film, is expected to name a new director within the next few days. \n \n Dec. 4, 7:10 p.m. Singer's statements added. \n \n (Aaron Couch contributed to this report.) ||||| The filmmaker, who was helming 'Bohemian Rhapsody,' was terminated by the studio because of his absence from the set. \n \n Bryan Singer has struck back against charges he was terminated for being unprofessional on the set of Bohemian Rhapsody, the Queen biopic he was directing for Fox and New Regency.

The director also was accused of acting unprofessionally in taking prolonged absences from the set. When production has halted Dec. 1, the studio cited the \u201cunexpected unavailability\u201d of the filmmaker. \n \n Said Singer in the statement: \u201cBohemian Rhapsody is a passion project of mine. With fewer than three weeks to shoot remaining, I asked Fox for some time off so I could return to the U.S. to deal with pressing health matters concerning one of my parents.

Poland's historians have put online what they say is the most complete list... (Associated Press) \n \n WARSAW, Poland (AP) \u2014 Historians in Poland have put online what they say is the most complete list of Nazi SS commanders and guards at the Auschwitz concentration camp in hopes some of them can still be brought to justice. \n \n The state-run Institute of National Remembrance said Monday that the SS KL Auschwitz Garrison list is based on data from archives in Poland, Germany, Austria, the United States and, to a limited extent, Russia, where archives remain mostly inaccessible. \n \n The work of historian Aleksander Lasik, the institute and the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial, it has more than 8,500 entries.

    "document": "VIRGINIA BEACH \n \n The Navy identified the two sailors who died and a third, who went missing, after a Navy helicopter crashed into the frigid Atlantic Ocean on Wednesday, about 20 miles east of Cape Henry. \n \n Lt. Wesley Van Dorn, 29, and Petty Officer 3rd Class Brian Collins, 25, died at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital Wednesday, officials told reporters at a Thursday afternoon news conference at Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek. Both were members of Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron 14, based at Norfolk Naval Station. \n \n The missing pilot, Lt. Sean Christopher Snyder, 39, of Santee, Calif., was identified by the Navy late this evening. \n \n In a statement issued by the Navy, the Snyder family thanked the Navy, Coast Guard and Virginia Beach fire crews for their efforts to rescue him. \n \n \"At this time, our hearts and prayers are for Sean's recovery, the other families who have suffered loss, and for the health of the hospitalized sailors,\" the statement said. \n \n Van Dorn, a pilot, was from Greensboro, N.C. and had served for more than six years. \n \n Collins, an aircrewman, was from Truckee, Calif., and had been in the Navy about two years, officials said. \n \n Four of the five crewmembers, including Van Dorn and Collins, were pulled from the water after the crash Wednesday morning. The search for Snyder has been ongoing. \n \n The Coast Guard and Navy searched an area of more than 600 square miles before suspending its active search for the missing crew member at 3:30 this afternoon, said Coast Guard Capt. John Little said. Crews will continue working to recover wreckage and search for remains. \n \n \"It was a very challenging decision to make, but it's one that we felt we had to make,\" Little said. \"It was an exhaustive search.\" \n \n The Navy also requested assistance from the Virginia Beach fire and police departments again today. The Fire Department sent its mobile command center to First Landing State Park to be used as the Coast Guard's command post for the day, said Battalion Chief Amy Valdez. A fire boat with side-scan sonar capability assisted along with a police boat that has a tow sonar. \n \n During a news conference this afternoon, the Navy said one sailor had been released from Sentara Norfolk General Hospital and a second was in stable condition. \n \n The Navy promptly launched an investigation Wednesday to determine what caused the late-morning crash, but the day's efforts were focused on the five sailors who went down aboard the troubled aircraft. \n \n With the water temperature around 40 degrees, Navy and Coast Guard officials feared their rescue mission could soon become a recovery operation. \n \n The day began routinely enough, with two MH-53 Sea Dragons from Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron 14, aka HM-14, leaving Norfolk Naval Station on a training mission. One of the aircraft made a distress call about 10:45 a.m., only moments before hitting the water. \n \n It was unclear whether the crew performed an emergency water landing or lost control and crashed, said Capt. Todd Flannery, the commander of Helicopter Sea Combat Wing Atlantic. \n \n \"I don't know,\" said Flannery, repeating a line he uttered more than a half-dozen times during a somber news conference on the flight line where the downed aircraft had taken off hours earlier. \"There's a lot we don't know right now.\" \n \n After impact, the second helicopter dropped a raft into the water, and two crew members climbed in. \n \n The Coast Guard cutter Shearwater was 2 miles away - close enough to hear but not see the crash - and made its way to the scene as the Navy dispatched two MH-60 Seahawks from Norfolk Naval Station. \n \n The rescue helicopters arrived within 30 minutes of impact and hoisted the two sailors from the raft. Two other crew members were pulled from the chilly water about 45 minutes after the crash and were hoisted into the second Seahawk. The four sailors were flown to Norfolk General. Two died there, one was listed in serious condition, and the other was upgraded to fair. \n \n When Virginia Beach rescue boats arrived near the crash location, they encountered a large debris field that spread over a half-mile area, Battalion Chief Tracy Freeman of the Virginia Beach Fire Department said. \n \n Pieces of the helicopter were scattered across the water. A fireboat with side-scan sonar helped find the fuselage and tail section, which had sunk by the time rescue crews arrived. \n \n The Coast Guard and Navy planned to search through the night for the fifth crew member. All would have been wearing survival suits for a flight over cold water, Flannery said, but it's unclear how long someone could survive in those conditions. \n \n The Navy sent divers from Little Creek to the crash site. Other ships assisting the joint search and rescue operation include the guided missile destroyer Jason Dunham, the amphibious transport dock Mesa Verde, the salvage vessel Grasp and a cargo ship, the Medgar Evers. \n \n At the Norfolk hospital, Chris Goetz said he saw two Navy helicopters land and drop off two crew members each. \n \n \"They came in fast, that's why I noticed,\" said Geotz, an electrician who was working at the facility. \"They started screaming. The first person was unconscious, and his arms were dangling. The second person had his hands bandaged, and his face was burned, but at least he held his hands up.\" \n \n Navy officials said they would not identify the crew members who died until 24 hours after relatives were notified. \n \n \"Our heartfelt thoughts and prayers go out to the families and the loved ones of those hurt and killed in today's crash,\" Flannery said. \n \n Wednesday's crash was the second tragedy to strike the small MH-53 Sea Dragon community in as many years. It's also the latest accident for a workhorse airframe that the Navy had planned to retire more than five years ago. \n \n According to the Naval Safety Center, the crash is the fourth major accident involving a Sea Dragon since 2012. MH-53s have crashed at a rate more than 10 times greater than other Navy helicopters over the past five years, according to the center's data. \n \n Assigned to just two Norfolk-based squadrons, HM-14 and HM-15, Sea Dragons are equipped to detect and clear submerged mines - a critical capability in the Navy's mission of ensuring clear shipping channels abroad. The massive $50 million helicopters are also used to move people and cargo and are the Navy's preferred option for heavy-lift operations. \n \n Sea Dragons were introduced to the fleet in the early 1980s. The service had planned to begin phasing them out in the mid-2000s, but without a viable replacement, it kept the Sea Dragons flying. The goal is to use them through 2025. \n \n After a crash in July 2012 claimed the lives of two Norfolk-based sailors during a heavy-lift mission in Oman, the Navy uncovered systemic problems within the Sea Dragon community stemming from a lack of investment in the aging airframes. \n \n \"This didn't just happen overnight,\" Flannery said during a November interview with The Virginian-Pilot. \"This was an atrophy over a long period of time, and the reason was, the Navy slowly but surely kind of forgot about the HM community.... It was absolutely tragic that it came to a head the way that it did.\" \n \n After the Oman crash, the Navy invested millions of dollars to upgrade and better maintain its remaining 29 Sea Dragons, Flannery said in November. It added more than 100 maintenance personnel to the two Norfolk-based squadrons, enhanced pilot training and installed new leadership. \n \n There are currently no plans to ground the Sea Dragons. \n \n Asked Wednesday whether he had concerns about the safety of the MH-53s, Flannery said: \"No, I don't. I do not.\" \n \n Pilot reporters Cindy Clayton, Lauren King and Gary Harki contributed to this report. \n \n Mike Hixenbaugh, 757-446-2949, mike.hixenbaugh@pilotonline.com ||||| Toby Melville / Reuters A Pave Hawk helicopter, military personnel and emergency services attend the scene where another helicopter crashed near the village of Cley in Norfolk, eastern England. \n \n Four American airmen were killed when a U.S. military helicopter carrying live ammunition crashed into a nature reserve on the east coast of England on Tuesday, spreading debris including \"hazardous\" bullets across an area the size of a soccer field, police said. \n \n The Air Force HH-60 Pave-Hawk chopper \u2014 a modified version of the Army's Black Hawk \u2014 was practicing flying at low altitudes when it went down, the U.S. officials said.

    "document": "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 A Missouri appeals court judge was appointed Monday to take over Ferguson's municipal court and make \"needed reforms\" after a highly critical U.S. Department of Justice report that was prompted by the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown. \n \n The Missouri Supreme Court said it is assigning state appeals Judge Roy L. Richter to hear all of Ferguson's pending and future municipal court cases. The high court said Richter also will have the authority to overhaul court policies to ensure defendants' rights are respected and to \"restore the integrity of the system.\" \n \n Ferguson Municipal Judge Ronald J. Brockmeyer resigned Monday, saying through a spokesman that he was stepping down to promote public confidence in the court and help Ferguson \"begin its healing process.\" \n \n The Ferguson City Council met in closed session Monday evening, but members left without taking questions and a city spokesman didn't disclose the purpose of the meeting. Ferguson City Manager John Shaw was escorted to his vehicle by a police officer without fielding questions, and Mayor James Knowles III declined comment to The Associated Press afterward except to say that the city on Tuesday would begin seeking Brockmeyer's permanent successor. \n \n Richter will take charge of the court on March 16. The Supreme Court said it also is assigning staff from the state court administrator's office to aid Richter in reviewing Ferguson's municipal court practices. \n \n \"Judge Richter will bring a fresh, disinterested perspective to this court's practices, and he is able and willing to implement needed reforms,\" Chief Justice Mary Russell said in a written statement. \n \n \"Extraordinary action is warranted in Ferguson, but the Court also is examining reforms that are needed on a statewide basis,\" Russell added. \n \n The change comes after the Justice Department released a report last week that cited cases of racial profiling and bigotry by police and chided what it described as a profit-driven municipal court system in the predominantly black St. Louis suburb where Brown, 18, was shot by a white Ferguson police officer on Aug. 9. The shooting prompted protests in the St. Louis area and across the nation. \n \n A St. Louis County grand jury and the U.S. Justice Department both declined to bring charges against Officer Darren Wilson, who resigned from the department. The Justice Department report said Wilson acted in self-defense when he shot Brown. \n \n But the Justice Department said Ferguson's police and court systems functioned as a money-making enterprise that heightened tensions among residents. \n \n The federal report noted that Ferguson was counting on revenues from fines and fees to generate $3.1 million, or nearly one-quarter of its total $13.3 million budget for the 2015 fiscal year. \n \n Although it was rare for the court to sentence people to jail as a penalty for city code violations, the Justice Department report said the city's court almost always imposes monetary penalties and then issues arrest warrants when people fail to pay on time or miss a court date. As a result, relatively minor violations can \u2014 and frequently do \u2014 lead to arrests and jail time, the report said. \n \n The federal report also cited several instances in which Ferguson's municipal judge, court clerk or city prosecutor helped \"fix\" tickets for colleagues and friends. \n \n The report cited the forgiven tickets for Ferguson officials as evidence of \"a double standard grounded in racial stereotyping.\" It said Ferguson officials displayed \"a striking lack of personal responsibility among themselves\" while some nonetheless asserted to federal investigators that the city's African-American residents lacked \"personal responsibility.\" \n \n Attorney Bert Fulk said in a statement announcing Brockmeyer's resignation that Brockmeyer had been \"fair and impartial\" as a part-time judge and that the court clerk bore the primary responsibility for the day-to-day operations of the court. \n \n The city fired court clerk Mary Ann Twitty last week. \n \n Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon released a written statement Monday praising the \"strong and appropriate actions by the Missouri Supreme Court\" to overhaul the Ferguson municipal court. \n \n Monday's appointment of a new Ferguson judge drew mixed reviews among a dozen onlookers at that night's council meeting. Derrick Robinson, a protest organizer, said the move was \"letting us know they're hearing our cry, and I think it's a good step in reconstructing Ferguson.\" Meldon Moffitt, of St. Louis, countered that it wouldn't make anything better, adding \"the only way we can clean up Ferguson is to wipe out the police force, wipe out the courts and wipe out the judges.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Follow David A.

Ronald Brockmeyer, the Ferguson judge who doubles up as a prosecutor, resigned from both roles yesterday.

    "document": "By Piper Wheeler \n \n In a gleaming lab in Emeryville\u2019s biotech corridor, food scientists are busy perfecting what they hope is the future of dairy. \n \n Local startup Ripple Foods amassed $15 million in venture capital funding during 2015. Now the company is gearing up to launch its first run of products, expected to arrive in an unnamed national chain sometime this month. Ripple will join established brands \u2014 Almond Breeze, Rice Dream, So Delicious \u2014 in the \u201calternative dairy space,\u201d a market whose current value tops $2 billion per year, according to some analysts. \n \n Ripple founders Adam Lowry and Neil Renninger are plant-food proselytizers who aren\u2019t afraid of hard science. While Ripple is their first food-focused venture, both have experience in climate science research and developing sustainable products. \n \n Lowry is a former climate scientist from the Carnegie Institution for Science who was a co-founder of the San Francisco-based nontoxic, biodegradable cleaning supply company, Method Products. Renninger co-founded Emeryville\u2019s Amyris, Inc., a company that produces renewable alternatives to petroleum-based products. \n \n At Ripple, Lowry and Renninger have developed a method of isolating the natural proteins found in split yellow peas to create a nutritious goo. Unlike the soy-derived proteins that give soy milk its distinctive flavor, Ripple\u2019s pea protein isolates have an enviable quality: they taste of nothing at all. \n \n This smooth, white, high-protein substance is blended with water, sunflower oil, stabilizers and flavoring to produce a variety of \u201cmilks\u201d \u2014 plain, sweetened, vanilla and chocolate. The result is a vegan drink that contains 8 grams of protein \u2014 the same as cow\u2019s milk. As many non-dairy beverages lack protein, this fact alone may draw consumers. \n \n Ripple is also free of common allergens like soy and nuts. It\u2019s free of gluten as well as GMOs, which will also be a major selling point for dairy-free consumers who keep strict tabs on their food\u2019s sourcing. \n \n The \u201csweetened\u201d version will contain about half the sugar that is found in a serving of cow\u2019s milk. Nutritionists might point out that the cane sugar used to sweeten Ripple beverages is not quite equivalent to the sugars naturally present in cow\u2019s milk. Renninger, however, said that his recipe\u2019s high-protein content balances the sugar, and that Ripple is indeed a low glycemic beverage. \n \n A serving will also provide 45% of daily calcium needs. \n \n \u201cAnd the calcium comes from the protein, meaning it\u2019s more bio-available and easily absorbed,\u201d Renninger said. \n \n On the other side of the table, Lowry is eager to hype his product\u2019s environmental bona fides, and has clearly been spending time with some drought-conscious Californians. \n \n \u201cEvery single gallon of almond milk requires a thousand gallons of water!\u201d Lowry said, still incredulous. (This number is up for debate, and it changes depending on methods of calculation.) Regardless, cow\u2019s milk is still worse: depending on who you ask, it demands from 125% to 200% as much water as almond milk. \n \n The water required to create Lowry and Renninger\u2019s plant-based milks is, in comparison, a mere drop in the bucket. Ripple\u2019s founders estimate that their product uses 96% less water than almond milk, and 98.5% less water than cow\u2019s milk. \n \n For now, French-raised peas are causing Ripple\u2019s carbon footprint to shoot up a bit. \u201cIt\u2019s neck and neck with almond milk,\u201d Lowry said, with some consternation. \u201cBut that will improve with U.S.-grown peas.\u201d \n \n By the end of 2016, all ingredients will be sourced entirely from the U.S., the founders said. \n \n Also in the works is an organic label, which Renninger acknowledges their target audience will look for. \n \n \u201cReally, though, the product sells itself,\u201d Lowry said, lauding the milk\u2019s body, protein and taste. \n \n Consumers will decide for themselves before too long. Bay Area stores will begin stocking Ripple products this month. \n \n Connect with Ripple Foods on Facebook and Twitter. \n \n Connect with NOSH on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, and subscribe to the free NOSH Weekly email for all your East Bay food news. ||||| Dive Brief: \n \n Pea-based milk producer Ripple could disrupt an already disruptive plant-based dairy industry with new technology and promoting itself as having additional health and sustainability benefits as compared to category leaders like almond and soy milk. \n \n Ripple developed a technology the company is currently trying to patent that separates the pea's health benefits from the flavor and color. \n \n According to Ripple, it has a 93% smaller carbon footprint compared to traditional dairy. \n \n Dive Insight: \n \n One drawback to certain plants is that while they provide desirable health benefits, manufacturers have a difficult time engineering the plant's flavor and color out of the resulting product. If Ripple's technology were widely available, manufacturers could use more plant types to add a variety of health benefits and functionality to food and beverage products. \n \n Pea-based milk can also lead to other pea-based dairy products, such as yogurt. With its own high protein content, pea-based milk yogurt could give the Greek yogurt industry stiff competition. And that could be in terms of both breakfast and other eating occasions, as Chobani is currently exploring.",

The idea is attracting plenty of buzz because of a slew of positives, the notable one being that the drink has 8 grams of protein per serving, the same amount as milk from cows and eight times the amount of almond milk. \"As many non-dairy beverages lack protein, this fact alone may draw consumers,\" observes a post at Berkeleyside.com. It also has 50% more calcium than dairy milk, and a much smaller carbon footprint than either dairy or almond milk. \"The primary challenge is one of flavor,\" says Ripple co-founder Adam Lowry. \"If you just make pea milk the way that you make almond milk, with regular yellow peas, you can get a very high-protein beverage, but it frankly tastes terrible.\" The company says it has patented a system to keep the nutrients but ditch the pea flavor and color, a method that involves blending it with water, sunflower oil, and stabilizers. If this system proves legit, it could open up all kinds of plants to the process and \"disrupt an already disruptive plant-based dairy industry,\" notes a post at Food Dive.

    "document": "PLEASANTON -- Two sisters facing charges they endangered infants' lives by binding them too tightly in swaddling blankets at a Livermore preschool are both expecting babies of their own, family members said Thursday after a court hearing. \n \n Sisters Nazila Sharaf, 35, and Lida Sharaf, 33, appeared in a Pleasanton courtroom Thursday afternoon, a day after they were arrested at their homes in Dublin and Mountain House on felony child abuse charges. Both women let their thick hair fall in front of their faces to avoid being seen in court and were wearing large, red jumpsuits that concealed their pregnant bellies. \n \n \"They are greatly embarrassed ... mortified by where they are,\" said Timothy Rien, the sisters' defense attorney. \"They are obviously shaken by the condition they're in.\" \n \n The sisters were arraigned on three counts of felony child abuse and neglect and four counts of misdemeanor child abuse and neglect, stemming from an investigation by Livermore police into their care of infants at Universal Preschool LLC, at 1040 Florence Road. A plea hearing was scheduled for Monday. \n \n Ferdinand Benitez, who is the father of a 22-month-old son with Lida Sharaf, confirmed reports from jail officials that both women are pregnant. Lida Sharaf's second child is due in July, and Nazila Sharaf is 4\u00bd months pregnant and also has a son, who celebrated his 9th birthday the day of his mother's arraignment, Benitez said after the hearing at the Gale-Schenone Hall of Justice in Pleasanton. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Both women are in protective custody at Santa Rita Jail, officials said. Bail was originally set at $700,000 for each woman but was reduced to $340,000 during Thursday's court proceedings. \n \n \"There is a fight ahead in this case,\" Rien said. \"First is the fight over bail, and then there's a fight over the charges themselves.\" \n \n A dozen family members and friends showed up to support the pair, while several parents and others attended the hearing to show their outrage about the alleged abuse at the preschool. \n \n Hank Dedrick, who belongs to the Alameda County chapter of Bikers Against Child Abuse, attended the hearing with two other members to show support for the victims' families. \n \n \"We support them from womb to tomb,\" Dedrick said. \"As far as I'm concerned, if you hurt a child like that you completely destroy their soul.\" \n \n Although swaddling is a common technique used to lull newborns to sleep, the Sharafs allegedly put seven babies in danger at the day care center by binding the infants' bodies so tightly they had trouble breathing and couldn't move their arms and legs, police said. \n \n The Sharaf sisters maintain that they in no way intended to hurt the babies with their swaddling methods, Rien said. \n \n \"Their contention is that it is not abuse,\" Rien said. \"But nobody is going to take away from a parent their concern for their child when they are in someone else's care.\" \n \n Doctors examined all of the children who were at the day care center, and none showed signs of injury related to the alleged abuse, Officer Steve Goard said. \n \n State officials closed the Livermore facility on March 15 and are seeking to permanently revoke the women's license. \n \n Investigators said that both Nazila and Lida Sharaf are suspected of tying blankets around seven infants between the ages of 7 months and 11 months so tightly they restricted the babies' ability to breathe and move their arms and legs. The women secured the wrapped blankets with heavy-duty knots for a \"lengthy\" period of time, Goard said. \n \n Police also learned that the women sometimes threw blankets over the children's faces while the infants had their arms and legs bound, rendering the babies virtually incapable of rescuing themselves if they needed air. Perhaps most disturbingly, Goard said, is that of the seven children identified in the case, both Sharafs knew that three of the babies had upper respiratory conditions. \n \n \"They basically restrained these children, almost like a boa constrictor,\" Goard said. \"All of these children could have died in the process of binding these extremities.\" \n \n A police statement released Wednesday also suggested that Nazila Sharaf had grabbed the arms of at least three infants out of frustration and carried them across the room by their extremities, which could have caused a broken arm, torn ligament or spinal fracture. Police also said that the Sharafs would crank the heat in the room up to 75 to 80 degrees under the assumption that it would cause them to become sleepy. \n \n Thirty parents of 19 infants were interviewed during the investigation, police said. \n \n The investigation began on March 15, after the Department of Social Services requested their assistance in closing the center. Social Services reported multiple licensing violations discovered during an unannounced visit March 12, including inappropriate swaddling techniques. \n \n Swaddling is a common technique used on newborns where a caregiver wraps the infant in a blanket in a snug yet comfortable way to reassure them and help them fall asleep, officials said in reference to pediatric experts. The technique, which is prohibited by state licensing, is usually intended for newborns between 1 month and 2 months old. \n \n Lida Sharaf had previously operated another child care facility, Discovery Child Development Center. In 2010, the state Department of Social Services shut that facility down for a similar swaddling offense, according to department spokesman Michael Weston. \n \n Lida Sharaf agreed to sell her facility and give up her rights as a licensee at that time, Weston said. In return, the department agreed to allow her to continue to work and be a presence at a child care facility, so long as she was not the licensee or the owner. \n \n In 2011, Nazila Sharaf received a license as the owner of Universal Preschool, which reopened at the same location with Lida as an employee. \n \n No criminal action was taken at that time, as that case was not submitted to law enforcement, Goard said. \n \n Investigators found at the school that there was a large distance between the door and the back room where the babies would sleep in their cribs, and that the sisters could easily tell when someone was coming and make modifications to the sleeping arrangements, Goard said. \n \n Other violations discovered during Social Services' visit to Universal Preschool in March included an infant sleeping in a car seat and another in a high chair, and finding that there were more children at the center than the license allowed. \n \n When officials arrived to serve the shutdown order, they also found a person caring for children who had not had a background check performed. \n \n The state's complaint also accuses Lida Sharaf of asking a Social Services inspector to conceal evidence or not report the violations. In addition to a temporary suspension order against the facility, Social Services issued bans against the Sharafs from working at any state-licensed child care facilities, Weston said. The women filed an appeal to the ban, which will likely trail the criminal proceedings. \n \n Contact Erin Ivie at eivie@bayareanewsgroup.com.

Many investors have cut their exposure to Greece and are focusing more on the state of core markets such as Germany and France. \n \n FEAR FOR THE FUTURE \n \n Even with Tuesday's non-bank gains, stocks have fallen to roughly the level they were at in 1990 and, while not as low as they were in 2012, are some 52 percent down on last year's high. \n \n \"Logically the market should be close to bottoming out at these levels after such a fall. Banks have been a drag on the benchmark index, given dilution fears in view of their need to recapitalizes,\" said Costis Morianos, head of Athens-based Asset Wise Capital Management. \n \n Athens is in new bailout talks with its European Union partners and the threat of political and economic instability remains high. \n \n There have, however, been signs of progress. \n \n Greece said it expects to conclude a bailout deal with international lenders by Aug. 18, with the drafting of the accord starting on Wednesday. Its finance minister went further: \n \n \"Everything will be concluded this week,\" Euclid Tsakalotos told reporters after meeting representatives of the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the euro zone's rescue fund, the European Stability Mechanism. \n \n He did not elaborate and it was not immediately clear what level of agreement he was referring to. \n \n It has been estimated by both the banks themselves and the creditors that between 10 billion and 25 billion euros ($11 billion-27.5 billion) is needed to recapitalizes Greek banks. \n \n The economy, meanwhile, has reversed course and is heading back into recession. \n \n The European Commission says it will shrink by 2 to 4 percent this year, a return to the recession that plagued Greece for six years until 2014. \n \n A survey on Monday showed Greek manufacturing activity plunged to a record low as new orders plummeted and the three-week bank shutdown caused serious supply problems. \n \n At the same time, Greece's economic sentiment hit its lowest in almost three years in July, a monthly report by the IOBE think tank said. \n \n ($1 = 0.9108 euros) \n \n (Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky) ||||| NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Yes, your mutual fund may own some Greek stocks. No, most likely not a lot. \n \n An employee of the Athens' Stock Exchange stands behind a reception desk in Athens, Greece, on Monday, Aug. 3, 2015. Greece's main stock index plunged over 22 percent as it reopened Monday after a five-week... (Associated Press) \n \n Athens burst back into the spotlight Monday after its main stock index plunged 16 percent. The spasm of selling came after investors got their first chance to unload shares since the Greek stock market shut down five weeks ago. \n \n But U.S. investors have relatively little to fear from the crash, even though there's a good chance they're in a mutual fund that has some Greek stocks. That's because funds typically keep only an iota of their portfolios there. \n \n Consider funds that specialize in emerging markets, the type where it's most likely to see a Greek company. The average such fund with Greek stocks in its portfolio has just 0.5 percent of its holdings in them, according to the latest data from Morningstar. \n \n Across all categories, the average amount is 0.3 percent, not including funds that are entirely clear of Greek stocks. That's why investors are more worried about the effects that Greece's debt problems will have on the rest of Europe than about Greece itself. \n \n \u2014 WHICH TYPES OF FUNDS TYPICALLY HAVE GREEK STOCKS? \n \n International stock funds, unsurprisingly. Roughly 19 percent of them have at least one stock from the debt-wracked country. Nearly 40 percent of emerging-market stock funds have Greek investments. \n \n \u2014 HOW ABOUT OUTSIDE FOREIGN STOCK FUNDS? \n \n Even funds that don't sound like they dabble in foreign markets can have Greek holdings. Consider those specializing in master limited partnerships, which are popular with income investors and usually invest in U.S. pipeline operators. Five of the category's 29 funds have some Greek stocks, mostly shipping companies. \n \n Nearly 200 funds that Morningstar classifies as U.S. stock funds have some Greek holdings. But, again, the percentages are small: an average of just 0.4 percent. \n \n \u2014 WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST GREEK STOCKS? \n \n The largest companies in Athens' main index include bottling company Coca-Cola HBC, Hellenic Telecom and the Greek Organization of Football Prognostics, a sports betting and lottery company.",

    "document": "Arkansas is simultaneously the most fertile and most treacherous ground for a political campaign against Obamacare. Fertile, because the state's rapid sprint away from conservative Democrats and toward conservative Republicans makes it pretty easy to beat up Democrats like Sen. Mark Pryor. Treacherous, because the state's Republican legislature has pioneered and continued a \"private option\" for Medicaid expansion, cleaving the Tea Party (Americans for Prosperity, et al.) from the Chamber of Commerce, and preventing the state from joining the larger Obamacare rebellion. (Luckily, as Republicans are finding in West Virginia and Kentucky, Republican voters don't change overnight simply because they can access health insurance.) \n \n So: For a while, Americans for Prosperity was drenching Arkansas in ads that told the story of a woman whose health insurance had been canceled by the coverage mandates of the ACA. Democrats and liberal groups cried havoc\u2014the state had actually extended the life of such plans until 2017. What was AFP to do? Sink six figures into this ad. \n \n Advertisement \n \n ||||| Published on Apr 1, 2014 \n \n Listen to Jerry from Arkansas explain the problems and uncertainty ObamaCare has caused for him and his wife. Then tell Mark Pryor to stop supporting Obamacare at http://www.LieOfTheYear.com ||||| President Obama today heralded more than 7 million sign-ups for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act -- bringing to a close a politically bruising six-month enrollment period and a first major test for his signature legislative achievement. \n \n The 7.1 million who have signed up, the president said in a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden, \"despite several lost weeks out of the gate because of problems with the website.\" \n \n \u201cEven more folks want to sign up,\u201d he added. \u201c7.1 million \u2013 that\u2019s on top of the more than 3 million young adults who gained insurance under this law by staying on their family plan.\u201d \n \n The latest tally represents the total number of Americans who selected health plans through state and federal marketplaces created by the law since Oct. 1. \n \n The number is expected to grow as last-minute applications filed through 23 state-run insurance exchanges are counted and people continue to complete applications in the federal exchange into April. \n \n Obama noted that many of the \u201ctall tales\u201d opponents have told about the law have been \u201cdebunked.\u201d \n \n \u201cThere are still no death panels,\u201d Obama said to laughter. \u201cArmageddon has not arrived.\u201d \n \n Obama added, \u201cThe debate over repealing this law is over. The Affordable Care Act is here to stay.\" \n \n The 7-million figure has become a symbolic and political milestone since the administration embraced it as a \u201cgoal\u201d in mid-2013 based on a projection by the Congressional Budget Office. Reaching that mark is a noteworthy feat after the significant, high-profile technical glitches and website outages that plagued the enrollment process on HealthCare.gov from beginning to end. \n \n In his statement, Obama, flanked by Vice President Joe Biden, declared: \"We've taken a big step forward.\" \n \n Still, the number says little about the extent to which the health law has expanded coverage to the uninsured or will stabilize premiums. The administration does not yet know how many previously uninsured Americans gained coverage under the law. They also do not know the ratio of young and healthy enrollees to old and sick -- a key data point insurers watch to set their premiums. \n \n \"We have none of that breakdown data at this point,\u201d White House press secretary Jay Carney said today. However, \u201cwe already know that that breakdown is sufficient to ensure that the marketplaces will effectively function, that issuers will feel comfortable with the demographics,\u201d he said. \n \n Officials also cannot say how many of the 7 million applicants have paid their premiums to finalize enrollment. \n \n Nevertheless, Obama said, \u201cThis law has made our health care system a lot better -- a lot better.\u201d \n \n Meanwhile, Republicans continue to blast the law. \n \n \"All across the country our constituents are having an unpleasant interaction with Obamacare,\u201d said Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.. \u201cWhether they can sign up for a policy or not, they are discovering, of course, higher premiums, a higher deductible.\u201d \n \n Public support for the Affordable Care Act narrowly notched a new high in the latest ABC News-Washington Post poll, while criticism of Barack Obama\u2019s handling of the law\u2019s rollout -- although still substantial -- has eased from its peak last fall. \n \n Americans split on Obamacare: 49 percent support it while 48 percent oppose it. But last November just 40 percent supported it while 57 percent opposed it. \n \n \"I think I'm like a lot of people who end up waiting till the last minute,\u201d Caroline Mays, 30, of Washington, DC, told ABC News as she signed up for an Obamacare insurance policy late Monday. \u201cBut now I'm all squared away. I have health insurance. I've been working independently so I haven't had coverage. So this is a big relief to me, for sure.\u201d \n \n Senior administration officials credit grassroots organizing and a social media blitz, drawing on lessons from the 2012 election campaign, with fueling a last-minute surge in sign-ups. \n \n They say groups have held more than 5,000 events over the past 6 weeks, including appearances of Obama cabinet officials at 45 of those. They say their social media reach touched 350 million twitter followers and 33 million online video views. \n \n Privately, the White House points to what they call two pivotal moments in their campaign: A promotional video by NBA star LeBron James, who they say spurred other celebrities to help spread the word; and, the president\u2019s \u201ctwo ferns\u201d interview with comedian Zach Galifianakis, which generated significant buzz. \n \n \u201cI have a lot of friends who've been uninsured and have kind of been winging it,\u201d said Sarah Leonard, who enrolled for a new health policy on Monday. \u201cBut I know that that's not very responsible, especially at 26, you have to get responsible. I was going to try to wing it but then there's also the tax penalty and I really didn\u2019t want that either.\u201d \n \n Most Americans were required to obtain health insurance by March 31 or face a fine of the greater of $95 or 1 percent of household income above $10,150 for an individual. Those subject to the fine will pay it on their 2014 federal income taxes. \n \n As for the politics of the Affordable Care Act, administration officials say the focus now shifts to making the case against repeal. They note that no Democrat that originally voted for the ACA has flipped his or her vote \u2013 a sign, they say, that if implemention of the law is continued effectively, then the intensity of debate will wane. \n \n Congressional Republicans, meanwhile, are vowing to intensify the drumbeat for repealing the law ahead of the November midterm elections. \n \n \"House Republicans will continue to work to repeal this law and protect families and small businesses from its harmful consequences,\u201d said House Speaker John Boehner. \u201cWe will also continue our work to replace this fundamentally-flawed law with patient-centered solutions focused on lowering health care costs and protecting jobs.\u201d \n \n ABC's Shushannah Walshe contributed reporting. ||||| April 1 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. President Barack Obama speaks about the just over 7 million people that enrolled for insurance coverage under Obamacare. \n \n This afternoon President Obama, with a grinning Vice President Biden behind him, announced in the White House Rose Garden that sign-ups for his signature health law had exceeded original projections. \n \n Some 7.1 million Americans have signed up for Obamacare, the president said, by far exceeding the revised projection of 6 million insured after the disastrous roll out of the HealthCare.gov website in October. \n \n The president was clearly enjoying delivering the news: \"This law is doing what it's supposed to do,\" he said. \"It's working. It's helping people from coast to coast.\" He seemed bemused by the continuing efforts of Republicans do undo the legislation. \"Why are folks working so hard for people not to have health insurance? Why are they so mad about the idea of people having health insurance?\" \n \n Republicans were quick to jump on what a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner called Obama's \"victory lap.\" \"This law continues to harm the American people,\" said Boehner spokesman Michael Steel. \"Every promise the president made has been broken: healthcare costs are rising, not falling. Americans are losing the doctors and plans that they like \u2013 especially seniors suffering under President Obama\u2019s Medicare cuts. Small businesses are afraid to hire new workers, hobbling our economic growth.

A photo posted by @24january_ on Dec 3, 2015 at 4:56am PST \n \n As well as this. he researchers looked into a number of other personality traits, examining how the participants think about themselves and the world around them. \n \n The paper said that those who were more receptive to the bulls*** statements and who tended to rate them higher were \"less reflective, lower in cognitive ability(i.e verbal and fluid intelligence, numeracy,) and are more prone to ontological confusions and conspiratorial ideation.\" \n \n It also said they were more likely to \"hold religious and paranormal beliefs, and are more likely to endorse complementary and alternative medicine.\" \n \n As they say, \"our findings are consistent with the idea that the tendency to rate vague, meaningless statements as profound is a legitimate psychological phenomenon that is consistently related to at least some variables of theoretical interest.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 This has to rank among the best opening statements ever in a study abstract: \"Although bullshit is common in everyday life and has attracted attention from philosophers, its reception (critical or ingenuous) has not, to our knowledge, been subject to empirical investigation.\" And so researchers at the University of Waterloo in Ontario set out to study \"pseudo-profound bullshit,\" and who believes it. Reporting in the journal Judgment and Decision Making, the researchers asked subjects to rate quotes that are philosophical, mundane, or simply BS\u2014the latter consisting, in their words, of \"seemingly impressive assertions that are presented as true and meaningful but are actually vacuous\"\u2014on a profundity scale. The team also tested participants' cognitive and reasoning ability. The researchers found that those who are \"more receptive\" to BS have lower \"verbal and fluid intelligence\" and are more likely to believe in the paranormal, conspiracy theories, and alternative medicine. For actual examples of readily propagated BS, Forbes reports PhD candidate Gordon Pennycook and his team turned to the Twitter feed of Deepak Chopra, highlighting tweets such as \"Attention and intention are the mechanics of manifestation.\" The Telegraph reports the researchers also used this website, which composes made-up pseudo-profound statements like this one: \"Growth is the richness of life, and of us.\" The researchers found that participants assigned the website-generated BS and Chopra's tweets similar profoundness ratings. As for who was good at sniffing out BS, Forbes reports it was those who tend to \"have an analytic cognitive style and be skeptical about paranormal phenomena.\" Chopra's response to it all? He tweeted, \"I thank the authors for the study.

    "document": "Now this is what I call a summer movie. Baby Driver has it all: thrills, laughs, sex, nonstop action, a killer soundtrack, a star-making performance from Ansel Elgort and a director \u2013 Edgar Wright \u2013 who can knock the wind out of you. When was the last time to got pumped by a car chase? This revved-up ride of a movie is loaded with them, and they're spectacular. \n \n \n \n OK, let's back up and get our bearings. Elgort, the teen dream of The Fault in Our Stars, plays Baby, an Atlanta getaway driver with chronic tinnitus. That constant ringing and buzzing in his ears is why he's never without his earbuds; the music in his head drowns out the buzz and replaces it with nonstop beats. The first getaway, set to \"Bellbottoms\" by the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, is choreographed by Wright (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World) with a precision to match anything in La La Land. \n \n Here's the deal with Baby: To care for Pops (CJ Jones), the deaf gent who raised him after his mother died, he's been driving for crime boss Doc (a wickedly sly Kevin Spacey). The kid never robs a bank himself (no stomach for it); he also wants out, but there's one more job ... there always is. Doc sets up a crew that redefines the term \"natural born psychos\": Folks with criminal handles like Bats (Jamie Foxx) and Griff (Jon Bernthal), along with Buddy (Jon Hamm) and his main squeeze Darling (Eiza Gonzalez). Everyone in the supporting cast goes for broke here \u2013 but we'll single out Hamm, who adds glaze and a slice of pineapple in a performance of bracing, nutty perversity. \n \n Baby Driver slows down a bit when our hero falls hard for a diner waitress named Debora (Cinderella's Lily James). But the sweetness of their romance makes a pleasing contrast to the violence that escalates in the film's final third. Debora, who enters the movie singing \"Baby\" by Carla Thomas, is miffed that so few songs give her a name check. \"You have us all beat,\" she tells Baby. \"Every song is about you.\" James is enormously appealing as this dreamer who shares her beau's wish \"to head west on the 20, in a car we can't afford, with a plan we don't have.\" Since Baby is a man of few words, Elgort uses his expressive eyes as a window into Baby's heart. It's a challenging beast of a role and Elgort just crushes it. \n \n \n \n Still, this is Wright's show. Best known for his Cornetto Trilogy (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and The World's End), the ever-dazzling Wright tops himself with this start-to-finish sensation. It's not computers that generate the fireworks \u2013 the stunts are mostly done in camera (kudos to cinematographer Bill Pope), which gives the action a you-are-there urgency that the digiverse can't match. Expanding on an idea from his own 2003 music video for Mint Royale's \"Blue Song,\" Wright spent years perfecting how he wanted Baby Driver to look and sound on screen. \n \n \n \n The British director's attention to detail pays off handsomely. Glib comparisons to 2011's Drive with Ryan Gosling don't hold up, mainly because that expressionist film noir is not what Wright is aiming for. Think Walter Hill's 1978's The Driver (in tribute, Hill has a voice cameo), along with what Wright calls the Holy Trinity of 1990's pulp fiction: Point Break, Reservoir Dogs and Heat. As Baby Driver progresses, with Queen, Young MC, Martha Reeves and the Vandellasand Simon & Garfunkel reverberating in Baby's ears and on the soundtrack, this one-of-a-kind filmmaker leaves his indelible stamp on every frame. Wright is a true man of action, a cinematic grandmaster. Buckle up. ||||| \u2018Baby Driver\u2019 a high-speed vehicle for the fast and the hilarious \n \n Now we\u2019re talking. \n \n Edgar Wright\u2019s \u201cBaby Driver\u201d is one of the most entertaining thrill rides of this year, this decade. \n \n This century. \n \n It\u2019s wall-to-wall pure pop heaven, crackling with originality and dark humor, teeming with action sequences so perfectly timed and executed you almost want to run out of the theater on the spot so you can call a friend and rave about it \u2014 but you wouldn\u2019t dare leave your seat because you wouldn\u2019t want to miss a frame of this brilliant, pulse-quickening gem. \n \n \u201cBaby Driver\u201d is set in real world, present-time Atlanta \u2014 but it\u2019s spun in the fashion of a semi-fantastical folk tale, with familiar archetypes and classic conflicts. It feels a little bit like a 21st century urban Western. It\u2019s \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d meets \u201cLa La Land,\u201d and why shouldn\u2019t those two meet? (Wright is also clearly a fan of the films of Walter Hill \u2014 the veteran director even has a cameo in this film \u2014 and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he really dug Nicolas Winding Refn\u2019s \u201cDrive\u201d as well.) \n \n The appropriately baby-faced Ansel Elgort delivers a charming and cocky and infectious and borderline irritating performance as Baby, who is charming and cocky and infectious and, yes, borderline irritating. \n \n Baby is a savant behind the wheel who doesn\u2019t talk much, rarely goes without shades and is always, always wearing ear buds and grooving to his iPod tunes, the better to drown out the constant ringing in his ears from tinnitus that\u2019s plagued him since a tragic car accident when he was just a boy. \n \n We meet Baby as he\u2019s parked outside a downtown bank in a bright red, tricked-out Subaru. He fidgets with his iPod and clicks on \u201cBellbottoms\u201d by the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. \n \n A moment later, three armed robbers come flying out of the bank and dive into Baby\u2019s car. Baby cranks up the volume, races the engine, shifts gears \u2014 and off we go on one of the most creative and exhilarating car chases you\u2019ll ever see. \n \n At the obligatory rendezvous in a remote warehouse, we get to know the team of hardened criminals that pulled off the heist. There\u2019s the tattooed and menacing Griff (Jon Bernthal); the weirdly coiffed and dangerous but outwardly amiable Buddy (Jon Hamm), and Buddy\u2019s tough and gorgeous and wisecracking wife Darling (Eiza Gonzalez). \n \n Oh, and a perfectly deadpan Kevin Spacey is Doc, the big boss and mastermind who plans the heists and hires various gun-persons for each job \u2014 the only constant being Baby behind the wheel, because Baby never gets caught and Baby has become Doc\u2019s good-luck charm. (Also, Baby owes Doc and doesn\u2019t have a choice. We\u2019ll leave it at that.) \n \n Writer-director Wright serves up familiar, almost corny tropes that might have us rolling our eyes if we didn\u2019t feel we were in on the references. Lily James is the sweet-faced Debora, a dreamy waitress who talks and moves as if she\u2019s in a 1950s B-romance. CJ Jones is Baby\u2019s foster father, Joseph, who is deaf and mute and in a wheelchair. Jamie Foxx is sensational as Bats, the obligatory bloodthirsty maniac who\u2019s so psycho he even freaks out semi-psycho fellow criminals. \n \n We even get the old \u201cOne last job and then I\u2019m out!\u201d plot development. \n \n Yet nothing about \u201cBaby Driver\u201d feels like a retread. The dialogue pops and crackles with sharp one-liners, the chase sequences are gritty and exuberant and fueled by the eclectic pop soundtrack, the editing is tight and timely and the performances are spectacular. \n \n At one point during a shootout sequence, each blast of gunfire is in sync with the rhythm section of the pop song on the soundtrack. It\u2019s goofy and precise and really, really cool. \n \n \u201cBaby Driver\u201d is rich with intriguing characters. I\u2019d love to see an entire movie about Hamm\u2019s Buddy and Gonzalez\u2019 Darling, and how they got to where they are. (In a tense diner scene, the seemingly unhinged Bats speculates about their back story, drilling deeper and deeper, and seems to be hitting some pretty serious nerves, judging by their expressions.) \n \n And what\u2019s the deal with Spacey\u2019s Doc? He knows all and sees all, and he\u2019s capable of cold and calculating retribution if someone crosses him \u2014 and yet he has an almost fatherly affection for Baby. Where did THIS guy come from? \n \n In sepia-toned flashbacks, we learn about Baby\u2019s beloved mother \u2014 a singer with the voice of an angel \u2014 and his monstrous father. In brief fantasy sequences, Debora appears as a black-and-white vision. Like Baby\u2019s mother, she is pure and lovely and she represents all that is good and innocent and wonderful about life. \n \n As opposed to the maniacs with guns who want Baby dead after Baby makes some, shall we say, questionable decisions. \n \n And all the while, we hear the soundtrack feeding Baby\u2019s every move and reflecting Baby\u2019s every mood \u2014 literally dozens of songs, from \u201cTequila\u201d by the Champs to \u201cBrighton Rock\u201d by Queen to \u201cNowhere to Run\u201d by Martha Reeves & the Vandellas to \u201cRadar Love\u201d by Golden Earring to \u201cHocus Pocus\u201d by Focus, arguably the most ridiculous and undeniably catchy gimmick tune of the 1970s. \n \n It all works. All of it. The music, the performances, the twists and turns in the plot, the sheer energy and life force of the movie. \n \n If you see this movie and tell me you didn\u2019t have a great time, we\u2019re going to have to sit down and talk about your idea of a great time. \n \n \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 \n \n TriStar Pictures presents a film written and directed by Edgar Wright. Rated R (for violence and language throughout). Running time: 113 minutes.

Rating: 3.5 stars out of 4. \n \n Yes, that catchy Simon & Garfunkel song \u201cBaby Driver\u201d comes into play during Edgar Wright\u2019s zippy thrill ride of a movie; no, it will not easily leave your head (I\u2019ve been humming it for a week); and yes, the movie\u2019s just what you want a summer movie to be. \n \n \u201cBaby Driver\u201d isn\u2019t a musical (though I\u2019m having a blast at my desk imagining it as one, particularly Jon Hamm singing a bad-boy ballad), but it\u2019s a movie drenched in music. Its hero, Baby (the perfectly baby-faced Ansel Elgort, from \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars\u201d), lives his life with a perpetual soundtrack playing through earbuds, to drown out chronic tinnitus. He\u2019s a getaway driver by trade, and he drives like he\u2019s conducting a very fast symphony. Behind the wheel, he disappears into his music; out of the car, even more so: fingers tapping imaginary piano keys, body pretzel-twisting to the rhythm. And the movie dances, too: It\u2019s uncannily choreographed, with gestures and movements timed precisely to the soundtrack\u2019s beat. \n \n The story\u2019s one you\u2019ve heard many times: the old One Last Heist chorus. Baby, who has the misfortune of owing money to a crime boss known as Doc (Kevin Spacey), has developed a reputation as the best bank-robbery driver in Atlanta, and regularly ferries Doc\u2019s crew \u2014 Buddy (Hamm), Darling (Eiza Gonzalez) and Bats (Jamie Foxx) \u2014 on jobs. After finally paying off his debts, he thinks about a different kind of life with sweet diner waitress Debora (Lily James), whose smile is like a happy song. Doc, however, has another plan in mind, and gunfire rains down in the movie\u2019s third act. \n \n Movie Review \u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd \u2018\u2018Baby Driver,\u201d with Ansel Elgort, Kevin Spacey, Lily James, Jon Bernthal, Eiza Gonzalez, Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx. Written and directed by Edgar Wright. 113 minutes. Rated R for violence and language throughout. Opens Wednesday, June 28, at several theaters. \n \n But you\u2019re not watching \u201cBaby Driver\u201d for the story; you\u2019re watching to see the relish with which the cast dives into Wright\u2019s pool (just listen to what Spacey, in his usual robo-evil fashion, can do with the line \u201cI just drew a whole goddamn map in chalk\u201d) and the way the film marries sight and sound. A laundromat becomes Technicolor poetry with a row of dryers tumbling primary colors; a trio of lollipop-red sedans becomes a speeding shell game set to music; a camera whirls like a dance partner around Baby and Debora at a restaurant table, as she idly twirls a finger around the rim of a wineglass \u2014 producing an eerie hum. And, in a climactic chase scene late in the film, Baby abandons his car and just runs \u2014 you realize, breathless, that you think he can probably fly. \n \n This movie has long been a passion project for Wright (\u201cShaun of the Dead,\u201d \u201cHot Fuzz,\u201d \u201cScott Pilgrim vs. the World,\u201d \u201cAt World\u2019s End\u201d) and you can see that dizzy, heady obsession in every frame. Plus there\u2019s a wonderfully random celebrity cameo (watch for a character called The Butcher) and a perfect \u201cMonsters Inc.\u201d ref. \u201cBaby Driver\u201d should steal a good chunk of this summer\u2019s box office, and deservedly so.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 With a 97% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, it's safe to say that Baby Driver was worth the many years director Edgar Wright put into crafting it. The film focuses on the best getaway driver in Atlanta, who goes by Baby, and happens to want to leave his life of crime behind. The problem is that the crime bosses he runs with aren't keen to let that happen. Some reviews: It isn't just a \"brilliant, pulse-quickening gem,\" but \"one of the most entertaining thrill rides of this year, this decade. This century,\" writes Richard Roeper at the Chicago Sun-Times. It features \"perfectly timed\" action sequences, \"one of the most creative and exhilarating car chases you'll ever see,\" and \"spectacular\" acting from Jamie Foxx, Kevin Spacey, and Ansel Elgort. Plus it's \"crackling with originality,\" he raves. Moira Macdonald agrees it's a \"zippy thrill ride of a movie\" and \"just what you want a summer movie to be.\" The highlight is \"the way the film marries sight and sound,\" she writes at the Seattle Times. It's \"uncannily choreographed, with gestures and movements timed precisely to the soundtrack's beat\" and \"dances\" in front of your eyes. Wright \"turns every one of his protagonist's actions into a signifier of mood, thought and character,\" writes Justin Chang at the Los Angeles Times, referring to one scene in which Elgort displays \"the woozy grace of an under-caffeinated Gene Kelly.\" Eventually there's a \"dark turn\" that puts a damper on the fun, but it doesn't take away from the fact that \"this is movie craftsmanship and showmanship of a very high order,\" he says. \"Baby Driver has it all: thrills, laughs, sex, nonstop action, a killer soundtrack,\u201d and the list goes on,\" writes Peter Travers at Rolling Stone. He was especially impressed with the performances. Jon Hamm delivers one \"of bracing, nutty perversity,\" while Elgort gives a \"star-making\" turn in a \"challenging beast of a role.\" Still, it's Wright who \"tops himself with this start-to-finish sensation,\" he writes.",

    "document": "OAKLAND, CA\u2014Speaking over lunch last Friday, a Northern California man named Conal O'Rourke laid out what admittedly sounds like a crazy story: a year-long billing dispute over his home Comcast service that ultimately resulted in Comcast getting O'Rourke fired from his job at PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) in nearby San Jose earlier this year. \n \n But O\u2019Rourke arrived to last week\u2019s lunch meeting with Ars with an astonishing amount of documentation: he has pages and pages of Comcast invoices. He has a spreadsheet, photos, notes, business cards, and complaint letters. He and his lawyer, Maureen Pettibone Ryan, happily provided digital copies of these materials to Ars, which we have re-published with his permission here. \n \n As a result of his firing, O\u2019Rourke has hired a local attorney and is now threatening to file a lawsuit against Comcast if the company does not agree to his demands, which include \"a full retraction and apology, his re-employment with his former employer, and $100,312.50\" by October 14. \n \n A rogue $26.25 \n \n O\u2019Rourke first moved to California in early 2012 after 20 years of working for Andersen Consulting (later Accenture) in Connecticut, most recently as part of the corporate controllership division. During his career, O'Rourke developed skills in accounting, financial analysis, and auditing\u2014skills that proved useful in his eventual dispute with Comcast. \n \n In February 2013, he moved to a new place in San Jose and signed up for TV and Internet service with Comcast, since the only other competitive service, AT&T\u2019s U-Verse, was not available in his building. \n \n \"I was roped into Comcast, and with Comcast, my problems soon began,\" O'Rourke said. \n \n His first issues began when, after six weeks of service, he had yet to receive a bill. \n \n After eventually receiving his first bill in April 2013, O'Rourke noticed a number of problems. For one thing, his name was misspelled (an issue that never got corrected). \n \n More importantly, O\u2019Rourke noticed that Comcast was charging him for three \"additional HD outlets\" for an extra fee of $26.25 a month. He also was charged for cable boxes that he says he never activated (he planned on moving two additional TVs later on into his condominium), after allegedly being promised that he wouldn\u2019t be. \n \n Finally, as part of a promotional deal, O'Rourke says he was promised HBO and other premium channels for nine months, but they disappeared after just three. \n \n O\u2019Rourke said he called multiple times to try to get these issues resolved. When they weren\u2019t, he finally walked into his nearest Comcast store in San Jose. \n \n There he met with the assistant store manager, who gave him a business card and provided his personal cellphone number. \"He promises me that it will all be addressed and that we're going to look at it,\" O\u2019Rourke said. \n \n Then the real problems began. \n \n $1,820 in equipment he didn't order \n \n For the next few months, O\u2019Rourke says he was under deadlines at work and could not address issues with Comcast. \n \n By October 2013, O\u2019Rourke said that his Internet speeds suddenly dropped off, becoming \"unworkable.\" \n \n \"I had contacted them regarding lack of responsiveness and performance issues; sometimes my service wouldn't be usable and I had to hotspot in with AT&T,\" he said. \n \n Again he called, and again, Comcast promised to correct his problem\u2014sometimes by sending technicians to his home\u2014but according to O'Rourke, the company never did. \n \n O\u2019Rourke spent part of November and December 2013 traveling overseas, so he was surprised when he returned home to find several boxes at his doorstep containing \"12 pieces of equipment\" and a December 2013 monthly bill for over $2,000\u2014including $1,820 in equipment that he insists he did not order. \n \n According to the December 2013 invoice, O\u2019Rourke was charged for devices including an \"AnyRoom Hub\" ($420) and a \"Pace Host\" ($110). On December 30, 2013, carrying these various boxes back, O'Rourke walked into the same San Jose Comcast store to return the gear and get his issues resolved. \n \n When he took a service ticket at 1:59pm, he discovered that he was Ticket #395 but that the store was only on Ticket #251. Rather than spend his afternoon at the store, O\u2019Rourke came up with a plan. \n \n \"They close at 7:00pm, so I thought, I'm going to go at 6:45pm, then somebody will have a fire underneath them to address the problems,\" he said. \"I had had it up to here.\" \n \n A Comcast employee named Matt Doblias ended up helping O\u2019Rourke, took back the equipment, and cleared the charges. But that still didn\u2019t get to the root of the errors that had now persisted for months. (Ars sent an e-mail to Doblias, which bounced.) \n \n \"I provided Matt with the detailed spreadsheet in person, and he asked if I could send it to him, and he would take a look,\" O\u2019Rourke said. The next day, December 31, he did so, but Doblias \"responded that the spreadsheet never came through. I sent it again, then at the end of the day I asked for follow up and never heard back.\" \n \n O\u2019Rourke got irritated. \n \n \"On January 11, 2014, I was frustrated because I felt that I had done everything,\" he said. \"I sent [Doblias] an e-mail that I was hopeful would ignite him to do something. What I did was [show Doblias by e-mail that] I sarcastically wrote a letter [to Comcast Senior Vice President Lawrence Salva], recommending Doblias for the Employee of the Month award. I wrote it up but didn't put it in the mail. I wanted to give [Doblias] an opportunity to fix the problem.\" \n \n The letter included lines like: \n \n The reason why I have chosen to nominate the San Jose center is simple.

I worked for 20 years in corporate comptrollership. These errors become material after a while.\" \n \n Unbeknownst to O\u2019Rourke, however, his call set off alarm bells within Comcast. \n \n Listing image by Alyson Hurt ||||| OAKLAND, CA\u2014Speaking over lunch last Friday, a Northern California man named Conal O'Rourke laid out what admittedly sounds like a crazy story: a year-long billing dispute over his home Comcast service that ultimately resulted in Comcast getting O'Rourke fired from his job at PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) in nearby San Jose earlier this year. \n \n But O\u2019Rourke arrived to last week\u2019s lunch meeting with Ars with an astonishing amount of documentation: he has pages and pages of Comcast invoices. He has a spreadsheet, photos, notes, business cards, and complaint letters. He and his lawyer, Maureen Pettibone Ryan, happily provided digital copies of these materials to Ars, which we have re-published with his permission here. \n \n As a result of his firing, O\u2019Rourke has hired a local attorney and is now threatening to file a lawsuit against Comcast if the company does not agree to his demands, which include \"a full retraction and apology, his re-employment with his former employer, and $100,312.50\" by October 14. \n \n A rogue $26.25 \n \n O\u2019Rourke first moved to California in early 2012 after 20 years of working for Andersen Consulting (later Accenture) in Connecticut, most recently as part of the corporate controllership division. During his career, O'Rourke developed skills in accounting, financial analysis, and auditing\u2014skills that proved useful in his eventual dispute with Comcast. \n \n In February 2013, he moved to a new place in San Jose and signed up for TV and Internet service with Comcast, since the only other competitive service, AT&T\u2019s U-Verse, was not available in his building. \n \n \"I was roped into Comcast, and with Comcast, my problems soon began,\" O'Rourke said. \n \n His first issues began when, after six weeks of service, he had yet to receive a bill. \n \n After eventually receiving his first bill in April 2013, O'Rourke noticed a number of problems. For one thing, his name was misspelled (an issue that never got corrected). \n \n More importantly, O\u2019Rourke noticed that Comcast was charging him for three \"additional HD outlets\" for an extra fee of $26.25 a month. He also was charged for cable boxes that he says he never activated (he planned on moving two additional TVs later on into his condominium), after allegedly being promised that he wouldn\u2019t be. \n \n Finally, as part of a promotional deal, O'Rourke says he was promised HBO and other premium channels for nine months, but they disappeared after just three. \n \n O\u2019Rourke said he called multiple times to try to get these issues resolved. When they weren\u2019t, he finally walked into his nearest Comcast store in San Jose. \n \n There he met with the assistant store manager, who gave him a business card and provided his personal cellphone number. \"He promises me that it will all be addressed and that we're going to look at it,\" O\u2019Rourke said. \n \n Then the real problems began. \n \n $1,820 in equipment he didn't order \n \n For the next few months, O\u2019Rourke says he was under deadlines at work and could not address issues with Comcast. \n \n By October 2013, O\u2019Rourke said that his Internet speeds suddenly dropped off, becoming \"unworkable.\" \n \n \"I had contacted them regarding lack of responsiveness and performance issues; sometimes my service wouldn't be usable and I had to hotspot in with AT&T,\" he said. \n \n Again he called, and again, Comcast promised to correct his problem\u2014sometimes by sending technicians to his home\u2014but according to O'Rourke, the company never did. \n \n O\u2019Rourke spent part of November and December 2013 traveling overseas, so he was surprised when he returned home to find several boxes at his doorstep containing \"12 pieces of equipment\" and a December 2013 monthly bill for over $2,000\u2014including $1,820 in equipment that he insists he did not order. \n \n According to the December 2013 invoice, O\u2019Rourke was charged for devices including an \"AnyRoom Hub\" ($420) and a \"Pace Host\" ($110). On December 30, 2013, carrying these various boxes back, O'Rourke walked into the same San Jose Comcast store to return the gear and get his issues resolved. \n \n When he took a service ticket at 1:59pm, he discovered that he was Ticket #395 but that the store was only on Ticket #251. Rather than spend his afternoon at the store, O\u2019Rourke came up with a plan. \n \n \"They close at 7:00pm, so I thought, I'm going to go at 6:45pm, then somebody will have a fire underneath them to address the problems,\" he said. \"I had had it up to here.\" \n \n A Comcast employee named Matt Doblias ended up helping O\u2019Rourke, took back the equipment, and cleared the charges. But that still didn\u2019t get to the root of the errors that had now persisted for months. (Ars sent an e-mail to Doblias, which bounced.) \n \n \"I provided Matt with the detailed spreadsheet in person, and he asked if I could send it to him, and he would take a look,\" O\u2019Rourke said. The next day, December 31, he did so, but Doblias \"responded that the spreadsheet never came through. I sent it again, then at the end of the day I asked for follow up and never heard back.\" \n \n O\u2019Rourke got irritated. \n \n \"On January 11, 2014, I was frustrated because I felt that I had done everything,\" he said. \"I sent [Doblias] an e-mail that I was hopeful would ignite him to do something. What I did was [show Doblias by e-mail that] I sarcastically wrote a letter [to Comcast Senior Vice President Lawrence Salva], recommending Doblias for the Employee of the Month award. I wrote it up but didn't put it in the mail. I wanted to give [Doblias] an opportunity to fix the problem.\" \n \n The letter included lines like: \n \n The reason why I have chosen to nominate the San Jose center is simple. Their blatant disregard for the customer has made resolving my issues next to impossible. This behavior has proven to be quite profitable as I, like most customers, just throw their hands up in exasperation. However, now that I am no longer exasperated I intend on following up on my concerns. \n \n But O'Rourke heard nothing, and the billing errors persisted\u2014resulting in Comcast allegedly sending a collections agency after him. \n \n \"On February 5, 2014, [Comcast] said my account was two months past due and at that point pushing $300,\" he said. \"I don't order pay-per-view, and I explained [to the collections agency] that that can't be right, and they were insistent, and I walked them through it.\" \n \n She said, \u2018What color is your house?!?

But the California man hopes documentation and an in-person interview provided to Ars Technica will help prove that Comcast had something to do with him losing his job at PriceWaterhouseCoopers after a lengthy battle with the cable company over billing and service issues. O'Rourke has hired a lawyer and has issued an Oct. 14 ultimatum to Comcast\u2014a PWC consulting services client\u2014that requests \"a full retraction and apology, his re-employment with his former employer, and $100,312.50.\" His lengthy timeline begins in 2012, when he says he moved to the Golden State and signed up for Internet and TV with Comcast\u2014and everything started going wrong almost immediately. Among O'Rourke's numerous allegations: late bills; charges for and shipments of equipment he didn't order; not receiving the right promotional items; \"unworkable\" Internet speed; and not hearing back from Comcast employees when he tried to resolve issues. They never even got his name right on the bill, he adds. But the worst repercussion, according to O'Rourke, was getting fired from his job after he started calling Comcast's controller's office. He says via a letter written by his attorney that he was called in to a PWC partner's office and told that Comcast, a \"very valuable\" client, \"was very angry as a result of Mr. O'Rourke\u2019s complaints, and that Mr. O'Rourke was not to speak with anyone from Comcast.\" O'Rourke alleges after that meeting that he endured a PWC internal investigation and then was fired on Feb. 18. His attorney's letter says O'Rourke was \"shocked, humiliated, and ashamed based on the unjustified loss of his job. He sought counseling and was prescribed medication to address his emotional distress.\" He now has AT&T service at home, and is threatening to sue Comcast if the company does not comply with his demands.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n Children are being poisoned by a widely used dietary supplement which adults take for sexual enhancement, a new report warns. \n \n At least 275,000 calls \u2014 an average of one call every 24 minutes \u2014 were made to poison control centers because of exposure to all kinds of dietary supplements between 2002-2012, according to the Center for Injury Research and Policy and the Central Ohio Poison Center, both at Nationwide Children's Hospital. \n \n But in the report published online Monday, researchers singled out yohimbe tree bark extract as the latest in a long list of dangerous substances that children are accidentally ingesting. Of all the calls made to the poison control centers in the past decade, yohimbe exposure had the largest proportion of serious outcome and has been found to cause heart beat rhythm changes and kidney failure in children. \n \n Yohimbe is the name of an evergreen tree found in parts of central and western Africa. The bark of yohimbe contains a chemical called yohimbine, which is used to make medicine. For centuries, yohimbe has been used in Africa to treat fever and leprosy or as an aphrodisiac, but currently its most popular use is to treat erectile dysfunction in men and low libido in women, even though there is scant evidence that it works. \n \n As a dietary supplement, the dried bark of the yohimbe tree is available in capsule and tablets forms as well as in tea. Since the dose range is narrow \u2014 take too little and it doesn\u2019t work and take too much and it is toxic \u2014 use of this herb is not recommended. The Food and Drug Administration has received reports of seizures and kidney failure associated with yohimbe consumption. \n \n Even \u201csafe\u201d dosages may cause dizziness, nausea, insomnia, anxiety, a rise in blood pressure, and rapid heartbeat. Overdose can be fatal. Internet claims boast great results in the bedroom; however, there are many other FDA-approved medications for ED, like Viagra or Cialis, which are much safer and more effective. \n \n \"Many consumers believe dietary supplements are held to the same safety and efficacy standards as over-the-counter medications,\" said Dr. Gary Smith, senior author of the study and director of the Center of Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's. \"However, dietary supplements are not considered drugs, thus they are not required to undergo clinical trials or obtain approval from the FDA prior to sale, unless the product is labeled as intended for therapeutic use.\" \n \n In the study, 1,818 cases of yohimbe exposure were reported over the past ten years \u2014 512 of which were considered serious. The report was published online Monday in the Journal of Medical Toxicology. \n \n Related: Caffeine Overdose Killed South Carolina Teen \n \n The study also found that 78 percent of yohimbe exposures occurred in children, ages six or older, although most supplement exposures occur in children under six. Among reported exposures, 3.2 percent were admitted to a critical care unit for treatment, with one reported death. At least 1.3 percent of cases were serious and more than a quarter caused moderate harm. \n \n The vast majority of exposures were unintentional. \n \n Henry Spiller, co-author of the study and director of the Central Ohio Poison Center at Nationwide Children Hospital, says the findings show the need for child-resistant packaging, caregiver education and FDA regulation of yohimbe and other energy supplements. ||||| Regardless the type of dietary supplements\u2014from vitamins, energy drinks, herbal medicines, homeopathic products, to some hormonal treatments\u2014they usually come with big claims about boosting health and wellbeing. While those claims are questionable (and often unfounded), the products collectively do enhance one thing: the volume of calls to poison control centers. \n \n Between 2005 and 2012, the rate of supplement-related calls to poison centers increased 49.3 percent , researchers reported Monday in the Journal of Medical Toxicology. In the final year of data, the centers were getting calls at a rate of nearly 10 adverse exposures per 100,000 people. \n \n There didn\u2019t seem to be a big jump in use of dietary supplements during that time. Self-reported use among adults has held steady, around 49 to 54 percent, the authors note. But, these supplements are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration as are drugs\u2014no FDA review or approval is required before supplements hit the market. \n \n \u201cLack of federal oversight has led to inconsistencies in the quality of dietary supplements, product mislabeling, and contamination with other substances,\u201d Henry Spiller, a co-author and director of the Central Ohio Poison Center at Nationwide Children\u2019s, said in a statement. \n \n Examining nearly 275,000 reports from the National Poison Data System between 2000 and 2012, Spiller and his colleagues came up with trends and details about dietary supplement poisoning calls. Of all the exposures, 70 percent were in kids six years old or younger and 82.9 percent were unintentional. But not all the kinds of supplements were of equal concern. \n \n Of all the categories of products, homeopathic agents were the largest single cause of calls to poison control centers, accounting for 36 percent of calls. Between 2000 and 2010, the annual rate of exposures to homeopathic products jumped 227 percent and then fell by 18 percent between 2010 and 2012. \n \n Following homeopathic products, botanicals were the second leading cause of calls and accounted for 31.9 percent. Hormonal products, such as androgen supplements, came in third, accounting for 15.1 percent. \n \n But the most dangerous categories\u2014those with the highest proportion of serious medical outcomes\u2014included energy products, botanicals, and cultural medicines. Energy drinks can cause abnormal heart rhythms and breathing, as well as seizures. Two botanicals of note that seemed particularly dangerous were yohimbe, used for male sexual enhancement, and ma huang (aka ephedra), used for boosting energy, alertness, weight loss, and athletic performance. Yohimbe is linked to heart attacks, seizures, and kidney failure, while ma huang is linked to strokes, as well as heart attacks. In 2004, the FDA banned ma huang after it was linked to several deaths. The number of poisonings and deaths from ma huang plummeted after the ban. \n \n The ban even seemed to influence overall supplement-related poison calls. The rate of calls was on the rise between 2000 and 2002, jumping 46.1 percent, then decreased 8.8 percent around the time of the ban between 2002 and 2005 before increasing again 49.3 percent from 2005 to 2012. \n \n Though the data coming into poison centers may miss adult exposures and chronic, rather than acute, poisonings, the authors say it shows the FDA needs to do more. \u201cOur results demonstrate the need for FDA regulation of yohimbe and energy products in the US as was done successfully with ma huang products in 2004,\u201d the authors conclude. \n \n Journal of Medical Toxicology, 2017. DOI: 10.1007/s13181-017-0623-7 (About DOIs). ||||| (CNN) From 2005 to 2012, the rate of calls to poison control centers about dietary supplements increased by almost 50%, and most of the exposures were in children younger than 6 years old, according to a study published Monday in the Journal of Medical Toxicology . \n \n The study defines dietary supplements as any product that supplements the diet, including vitamins, minerals, herbs, botanicals, homeopathic agents and amino acids, and concentrates, metabolites, constituents and extracts of these ingredients. \n \n The researchers used data from the National Poison Data System , to which poison control centers submit their call information. From 2000 to 2012, there were 274,998 dietary supplement exposures reported to poison control centers across the US: one call every 24 minutes, on average. \n \n The symptoms most associated with supplement ingestion included tachycardia, or rapid heart rate; vomiting; nausea; irritability; drowsiness and dizziness. \n \n Seventy percent of the dietary supplement exposures were in children younger than age 6; 99% of those were unintentional. Overall, only 4.5% of all supplement exposures resulted in serious medical outcomes, mostly in children under age 6. \n \n Henry Spiller , study author and director of Central Ohio Poison Control, said parents still need to be extremely cautious about leaving these products within access of children. \n \n \"Sometimes, parents don't think of keeping dietary supplements away from their kids, because they're not medicines prescribed by the doctor. People think of them as natural,\" Spiller said. \"But they need to be treated as if they were a medicine. Don't leave them out on the counter. Keep them out of reach.\" \n \n Spiller said the two most common ways for children to ingest a supplement are while they're exploring the house or when a parent mistakes it for another kind of medication. \n \n Jeannette Trella , managing director of the Poison Control Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, added that many dietary supplements do not have child-resistant packaging. Because of this, she says, parents should really consider whether they want to store supplements in their homes. \n \n \"Parents should look at this as a risk-benefit analysis,\" said Trella, who is also a pharmacist and was not involved in the new study. \"It should be considered whether the potential benefit of taking the supplement really outweighs the risk of your child accidentally ingesting something they shouldn't and becoming sick.\" \n \n But children under age 6 were not the only group adversely affected by dietary supplements; many older kids and adults were, too. Among those who called poison control centers about dietary supplements, 21% reported adverse effects, according to the study. \n \n From 1999 to 2012, the number of adults who reported using dietary supplements has remained steady in the range of 49% to 54%. \n \n The study named the most dangerous supplements as ma huang, yohimbe, homeopathic agents and energy drinks. \n \n Ma huang is a stimulant containing ephedra that was outlawed by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2004. \n \n Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter. \n \n However, yohimbe -- often promoted as enhancing male sexual performance -- and energy drinks containing caffeine or other stimulant ingredients, as well as homeopathic agents that are supposed to help with migraines, asthma and other conditions, are still on the market. \n \n During the study's 13-year period, 34 people died of exposure to dietary supplements. Six deaths were associated with ma huang, three with homeopathic agents and one with yohimbe, the researchers said. These types of dietary supplements were also closely associated with serious medical outcomes. \n \n \"More than 170 million Americans take dietary supplements each year, and the responsible industry is invested in bringing safe and quality products to meet this demand,\" the Council for Responsible Nutrition, the leading trade association for the dietary supplement and functional food industry, said in a statement. \"We recommend that consumers store dietary supplement products in safe places, out of a child's reach. In addition, we recommend that consumers talk with their doctor or pediatrician about their family's supplement use.\" \n \n The group added that homeopathic agents, which were included in the study, are not dietary supplements and are regulated differently. The FDA said they are regulated as unapproved drugs \n \n According to the FDA's website, the agency \"regulates dietary supplements under a different set of regulations than those covering 'conventional' foods and drug products. Unless the products are intended to treat or prevent a disease, this means the FDA does not require companies to conduct clinical trials of dietary supplements.\" \n \n The FDA said it does not comment on specific studies, but it is reviewing these findings. Additionally, the agency suggests certain safety guidelines for consumers and parents who might use dietary supplements, including storing them out of sight of children and informing your health care practitioner if you are taking them. \n \n The FDA encourages consumers to report adverse events related to dietary supplements on its safety reporting portal \n \n For Trella, minimal FDA regulation is the most troubling aspect. \n \n \"Because dietary supplements are not regulated by the FDA, there are not robust studies done to ensure that they are efficacious or have a reliable safety profile,\" she said. \"We're often going down a path of unknowns, and for possibly no benefit at all.\" \n \n \"We really don't know if there's a benefit to taking any of these supplements, because of the lack of studies,\" she said. \"People need to be aware of that.\" \n \n Spiller also said people should reconsider how they think about dietary supplements. \n \n \"Just because it's a natural supplement doesn't mean it's safe,\" he said. \"I often use the example, technically, that cocaine is also natural. But that doesn't mean it's safe.\"",

Of those calls, the ones with the biggest proportion of serious medical outcomes had to do with yohimbe tree bark extract, NBC News reports. The extract, which comes from an evergreen tree found in Africa, has been used there for centuries to treat various maladies, but it's most popular as a libido booster for both men and women\u2014though there's little evidence of its efficacy. It can cause changes to heartbeat rhythm and even kidney failure in kids. Overall, the study found that between 2005 and 2012 there was a 49.3% increase in calls to poison control centers related to dietary supplements, including vitamins, energy drinks, homeopathic products, herbal medicines, and some hormonal treatments, Ars Technica reports. The senior author of the study notes that products classified as supplements aren't considered drugs, and thus don't go through the FDA approval process (and may not be stored in childproof containers). In the case of yohimbe, the FDA doesn't recommend its use, as it's easy to overdose. Even the recommended dosage can lead to problems such as high blood pressure and rapid heartbeat, and overdose can lead to seizures and even death. The study found 1,818 cases of yohimbe exposure reported between 2002 and 2012, 78% of them in children.

For anyone looking for a specific topic of information, place or person, that\u2019s a lot of stuff to sort through. \n \n \u201cIndexing all this content and making it so you can find it easily is a really hard problem,\u201d CEO Mark Zuckerberg said. \u201cGraph search is designed to take a precise query and return to you the precise answer.\u201d \n \n What does that mean? Essentially, Facebook wants to make it easier for users to find stuff from within a user\u2019s network of social connections, without having to exit the site. A search box topping the page prompts you to enter a search string that returns information relevant to your network. \n \n The thesis is this: Web search is about returning links to keywords and phrases. Google made its impact serving up the most relevant Web sites based on Page Rank. But Facebook\u2019s Graph Search is built on the idea that you\u2019re better served by finding content that\u2019s been shared within Facebook. It\u2019s your network of social connections, after all, and the philosophy is that you\u2019d rather see things from that network. \n \n The search paramaters are all about the stuff that circulates inside of Facebook \u2014 namely, content. Games, videos, pictures and people. Enter a phrase like, \u201cgames my friends play,\u201d and you\u2019ll get a list of content spit back out at you based on the connections that you\u2019ve already made within Facebook. \n \n Sound familiar? That\u2019s because it is \u2014 Google is trying to do this exact same thing with Search Plus Your World. The way that Google+ works, if you or your friends +1 content on Google+, it\u2019ll show up within your Google search results. The idea is, adding that social element into the mix makes users more apt to click on the content. \n \n But Google\u2019s problem is that Google+ isn\u2019t as widely adopted or used as much as Facebook is. Facebook has the one-billion-strong network of users to suggest content to one another. \n \n This also bodes ill for companies like Yelp, Foursquare and even the small startup Path, all of which aim to serve up recommendations to users based on their history of ratings, \u201cLikes,\u201d visits, etc. That\u2019s problematic for these smaller companies, all of which work on vastly smaller data sets than Facebook\u2019s gigantic network. \n \n Looking for something that isn\u2019t on Facebook? There\u2019s an answer to that, too. Facebook has partnered with Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine to serve up any Web content that isn\u2019t shared within the social network. Yet another slap in the face to Google there. \n \n But ultimately that isn\u2019t Facebook\u2019s goal. Facebook wants to keep users inside Facebook to find things. The more stuff we share, use and look for inside of Facebook, the less often we\u2019ll have to leave the network. \n \n Good luck with that, Mark. ||||| Bloomberg News \n \n Facebook is holding an event at 1 p.m. ET to unveil something new at its Menlo Park campus. \n \n It issued an invitation for the mystery event last week, which offered no clues other than to say: \u201cCome see what we\u2019re building.\u201d \n \n This press conference could be held for any number of reasons \u2014 it could be some kind of new product launch or a redesign of a popular component of Facebook. Many tech pundits are reporting that it could be a new search feature. \n \n WSJ reporter Evelyn Rusli will be reporting live from the event.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Facebook held a major press event today, but kept the media guessing about what it would be unveiling. The answer was what Mark Zuckerberg described as the \"third pillar\" of Facebook: Graph Search. Basically, the idea is to allow people to search for people, places, and things to do through their networks, the official announcement explains. For example, if you were trying to set up a Game of Thrones viewing party, you might search for \"friends in [your town] who like Game of Thrones.\" Going out? Search \"movies my friends like.\" Dating? Search \"friends of friends in [your town] who are single.\" The system will be \"privacy aware,\" Zuckerberg said, so \"you can only search for content that has been shared with you.\" It will also integrate Bing results, broadening the kind of information it can find\u2014though at one point Zuckerberg added that he \"would love to work with Google.\" The system is being rolled out as a limited beta release starting today. Right now, Zuckerberg says there are no plans to monetize the feature, though he said it \"could potentially be a business over time.\" Some instant reactions: Farhad Manjoo: \"This is the most natural-language search I've ever seen. It's a completely different paradigm from searching Google. Phrases, not keywords.\" Mike Isaac: \"Google built web search first, then tried to slap Google+ on top of it for personalization. Facebook taking the backwards approach.\" (See more from Isaac here.) Henry Blodget: \"I don't see how Facebook cashes in with this thing. Search could coin it for them. This, as executed, is just another feature.\" The stock market: Shortly after the rollout, Facebook's stock was down 2%, according to the Wall Street Journal.",

(Associated Press) \n \n North Korea has a long history of making sure it is not forgotten during high-profile events in the South, and Thursday's apparent test firing off its eastern coast made its presence felt. \n \n In the first speech of his first trip to Asia, Francis told South Korean President Park Geun-hye and government officials that peace required forgiveness, cooperation and mutual respect. He said diplomacy must be encouraged so that listening and dialogue replace \"mutual recriminations, fruitless criticisms and displays of force.\" \n \n The Argentine pope spoke in English, the first English speech of his pontificate. Usually he speaks in Italian or his native Spanish, but the Vatican said he would deliver at least four speeches in English on the trip to accommodate his Asian audiences. \n \n North Korea's apparent test firing was conducted from Wonsan on its east coast and the initial three short-range projectiles flew about 220 kilometers (135 miles), according to a South Korean Defense Ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing office rules. It wasn't immediately clear what the projectiles were. After an initial three firings an hour before Francis arrived, North Korea followed up with two others a short time after he landed. \n \n North Korea has conducted an unusually large number of short-range missile and artillery test firings this year. It has expressed anger over annual military drills between the United States and South Korea, which it says are invasion preparations. A new round of drills, which Seoul and Washington call routine and defensive, are expected to start in coming days. \n \n Neither Francis nor Park referred to the firings in their public remarks. \n \n Organizers of the pope's trip had invited a delegation of North Korean Catholics to attend his Aug. 18 Mass for peace and reconciliation at Seoul's main cathedral. But late last month, North Korean authorities told the organizers that they wouldn't participate for various reasons, a Vatican spokesman said. \n \n North Korea's constitution guarantees freedom of religion, but in practice only sanctioned services are tolerated by the government. The U.S. State Department says North Korea permits no religious freedom at all. Currently, there are no Vatican-sanctioned institutions or resident priests operating in North Korea. \n \n As he arrived at an airport just south of Seoul on the first papal visit in a quarter century, the pope shook hands with four relatives of victims of a South Korean ferry sinking that killed more than 300 and two descendants of Korean martyrs who died rather than renounce their faith. Francis plans to beatify 124 Korean martyrs who founded the church on the peninsula in the 18th century, hoping to give South Korea's vibrant and growing church new models for holiness and evangelization. \n \n Some elderly Catholics wiped tears from their faces, bowing deeply as they greeted the pope on the tarmac. A boy and girl in traditional Korean dress presented Francis with a bouquet of flowers, and he bowed in return. The pope then stepped into a small, black, locally made car for the trip into Seoul where the official welcome ceremony and speeches took place. \n \n Park, the South Korean president, said she hoped the pope's presence would heal the Korean Peninsula's \"long wounds of division,\" referring to the 1950-53 Korean War, which continues to divide the Koreas along the world's most heavily guarded border. \n \n \"Division has been a big scar for all Koreans,\" she said. \n \n Francis sought to encourage the pursuit of peace. \n \n \"Korea's quest for peace is a cause close to our hearts, for it affects the stability of the entire area and indeed of our whole war-weary world,\" he said. \"May all of us dedicate these days to peace: to praying for it and deepening our resolve to achieve it.\" \n \n As his plane flew through Chinese airspace early Thursday, Francis sent a telegram of greetings and prayers to Chinese President Xi Jinping. It was a rare opportunity for an exchange since the Holy See and Beijing have no diplomatic relations, and furthers a low-key push for better ties with China and efforts to heal a rift between the Chinese authorities and those Catholics who worship outside the state-recognized church. \n \n Other highlights of Francis' visit include his participation in a Catholic festival for young believers from around Asia. The pope is also expected to meet with some families of the South Korean ferry sinking in April. The government's response to the disaster, which killed mostly high school students, has angered many South Koreans. \n \n Park said she hoped the pope's visit would heal the pain many South Koreans are feeling because of the sinking and the recent deaths of young soldiers. \n \n \"A lot of bad things keep happening in our country right now, and people are going through tough times,\" said Ryun Sun-hee, a 19-year-old college student. \"So I hope this event can encourage people and bring more positive things to our country.\" \n \n It's the first papal visit since Pope John Paul II traveled to South Korea in 1989. In January, Francis plans to visit Sri Lanka and the Philippines. \n \n South Korea's church, which has been growing steadily over the last half century, is seen as a model for the future. Local church officials hope for a continuing increase in believers in a country that once welcomed missionaries to help spread the faith but now sends its own priests and nuns abroad to evangelize in other countries. \n \n Park credited Catholics in South Korea with playing a big part in making the country what it has become: South Korea has risen from poverty, war and dictatorship into Asia's fourth biggest economy. She called the Korean martyrs \"pioneers who spread freedom and equality,\" and said their sacrifice helped develop Korean society. \n \n There was high anticipation in South Korea ahead of the visit. Banners and posters welcoming the pope decorated streets and subway stations. The Yonhap news agency reported an increase in sales of rosaries and other Catholic goods, and special displays of books on the pope and Catholicism sprung up in book stores. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writer Christopher Bodeen in Beijing contributed to this story. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Pope Francis: \"Korea's quest for peace is a cause close to our hearts\" \n \n Pope Francis urged dialogue between the two Koreas instead of \"displays of force\" at the start of his five-day visit to South Korea. \n \n The Pope's call for peace came hours after North Korea fired short-range rockets around the time of his arrival. \n \n It is his first visit to Asia since he became pope in March 2013. \n \n Pope Francis will beatify Korean Catholics who died for their faith, attend a Catholic youth festival and conduct a \"reconciliation\" mass. \n \n In a speech addressed to South Korean President Park Geun-hye and senior officials, the Pope said reconciliation on the Korean peninsula had implications for \"the stability of the entire area and indeed of the whole war-weary world\". \n \n \"Diplomacy... is based on the firm and persevering conviction that peace can be won through quiet listening and dialogue, rather than by mutual recriminations, fruitless criticisms and displays of force,\" he said. \n \n He also called on Koreans to set an example for future generations. \"I think it is especially important for us to reflect on the need to give our young people the gift of peace,\" he said. \n \n Earlier in the day, North Korea fired three rockets off its east coast as the Pope's plane approached South Korean airspace.

    "document": "(CNN) The Senate Judiciary Committee will vote on whether to favorably recommend Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court as previously scheduled Friday morning, though top GOP senators did not know as of Thursday night whether enough key Republican votes had been convinced to confirm President Donald Trump's nominee. \n \n Kavanaugh's supporters and critics are now closely watching a handful of key Republican senators as they decide whether to support the nominee, following a day-long, blockbuster hearing that featured both Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault. \n \n The vote scheduled for Friday morning means undecided GOP members of the committee -- including Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake -- have just hours to publicly choose a side in a deeply polarizing political fight. \n \n As of Thursday night, Flake -- who also met earlier with fellow key votes Republican Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin -- told reporters, \"There's more doubt than certainty moving ahead.\" \n \n \"This isn't easy for anybody,\" Flake told reporters. \"Some of us have been talking for a while -- similar questions I guess.\" \n \n When asked if he thought more time before the deadline would help with his decision, Flake said he didn't know. \n \n \"When you have more time, you look at what more time has done in the past couple of days in term of ludicrous allegations, some of which have been recanted. Others just were anonymous to begin with, and what does that do to the accused. Just to give it more time. I don't know. You have to weigh those things, You have to weigh all those things.\" \n \n GOP senators told reporters that members meeting behind closed doors said the committee vote would happen as previously scheduled Friday morning and that the first procedural vote will take place on the Senate floor Saturday. GOP leaders had pushed for a full Senate vote on Tuesday, October 2. \n \n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnnell would not confirm if he had the votes following a conference wide meeting Thursday night. \n \n When asked if he was confident the nomination would advance out of committee, he replied: \"well the next step is the committee will be voting in the morning.\" \n \n He added, \"We're optimistic, basically.\" \n \n 'We're meeting at 9:30' \n \n Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley declined to answer questions Thursday night from reporters as he repeatedly said, \"we're meeting at 9:30\" -- a reference to the committee meeting where the panel is scheduled to vote on whether to give Kavanaugh a favorable recommendation. \n \n When asked by the media if the nomination will come to the full Senate floor for a vote, Grassley responded \"Depends on what happens tomorrow.\" \n \n Republicans can advance Kavanaugh's without any support from Democrats, but given their 51-49 seat majority in the chamber, Kavanaugh's supporters can only lose one vote and still advance his nomination. \n \n Sen. John Cornyn, who as majority whip is the second-ranking GOP member in the chamber, expressed optimism following a Republican meeting Thursday night that Kavanaugh's nomination will be favorably reported out of the committee on schedule. \n \n Asked if he is confident that Kavanaugh can advance out of the committee, he said, \"I am optimistic, yes.\" \n \n At least one long-undecided Republican senator, Bob Corker of Tennessee, announced his support for Kavanaugh just before 9 p.m. ET on Thursday night. \n \n \"While both individuals provided compelling testimony, nothing that has been presented corroborates the allegation,\" Corker said in his announcement. \"There is no question that Judge Kavanaugh is qualified to serve on the Supreme Court, and in a different political environment, he would be confirmed overwhelmingly.\" \n \n Four key senators meet \n \n The meeting of Flake, Collins, Manchin and Collins occurred less than hour after Kavanaugh finished his testimony before the Judiciary Committee , where he forcefully and passionately maintained his innocence and defiantly challenged Democratic senators who grilled him on multiple allegations of inappropriate behavior. \n \n On Thursday morning, that same committee heard from Ford, who she said was \"100%\" certain Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers in the 1980s. In Kavanaugh's testimony, he also said he was \"100%\" sure he did not sexual assault anyone. \n \n Collins and Murkowski have appeared to be the most outspoken Republican senators in seeking additional investigation into the allegations of inappropriate behavior that have surfaced against Kavanaugh in recent days. \n \n Multiple sources familiar with a private Wednesday meeting -- the night before the hearing -- told CNN that Collins appeared unnerved by the latest allegations, citing in particular that a sworn statement from accuser Julie Swetnick sent to the panel, which carries with it the possibility of perjury for lying to Congress. At that Wednesday meeting of Republican chairmen, GOP leaders tried to reassure Collins, keenly aware of the critical role she plays. \n \n When asked by reporters earlier this week whether there should be a full FBI investigation into the allegations, Murkowski responded, \"It would sure clear up all the questions, wouldn't it?\" \n \n On Thursday night, Murkowski said she was leaving to think over the nomination at home. \n \n \"I'm going to go home, have dinner and have a chance to think about all that's gone on today,\" Murkowski told reporters. \n \n Manchin is up for re-election this fall in a state Donald Trump won overwhelmingly and supported Trump's last Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch. Manchin was among a handful of Democrats from red and purple states that Kavanaugh supporters were targeting as possible votes. \n \n \"We are still talking,\" Manchin told CNN leaving that meeting. \"There are no decisions on anything. There are some concerns that people have and we're going to try to close the loop.\" ||||| \"His testimony was powerful, honest, and riveting,\" President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter of his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's testimony. | Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images White House Trump thrilled at Kavanaugh defiance The president applauds a Trumpian defense from his nominee \u2014 but some White House allies are concerned by his accuser's 'credible' performance. \n \n President Donald Trump and his aides were ebullient Thursday as Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh defiantly rejected charges of sexual misconduct \u2014 a mood that reflected some relief after Trump officials conceded that his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, offered a compelling performance in the first half of the day. \n \n Trump and senior officials were impressed by Kavanaugh\u2019s combative defense before the Senate Judiciary Committee, in which the Trump nominee, alternating between fury and tears, called several misconduct charges against him a \u201ccalculated and orchestrated political hit\u201d and \u201cnational disgrace\u201d that had devastated his life and family. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Minutes after the committee adjourned Thursday evening, Trump tweeted that his nominee \"showed America exactly why I nominated him.\" \n \n \"His testimony was powerful, honest, and riveting,\" Trump wrote. \"Democrats' search and destroy strategy is disgraceful and this process has been a total sham and effort to delay, obstruct, and resist.

Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time. \n \n That capped something of a roller-coaster day for a White House that had watched in the morning as Ford gave a powerful and disturbing account of what she said was a sexual assault by Kavanaugh when the two were high school students at a party in the 1980s. \n \n \"She seems sincere, kind, thoughtful and credible,\" a former Trump White House official said. \"Hard to suggest she is politically motivated.\" \n \n Trump, who watched the hearing aboard Air Force One on his flight back to Washington from New York City early in the day, refrained from tweeting until the day\u2019s proceedings had ended shortly before 7:00 p.m. Some of his aides fretted early in the day as Trump watched CNN and Fox News commentary suggesting that Ford\u2019s testimony \u2014 and what officials called a disappointing performance by a female prosecutor hired by Judiciary Committee Republicans to question her \u2014 might tip the balance against Kavanaugh\u2019s troubled nomination. \n \n Kavanaugh said he did not share his fiery opening remarks with anyone except a law clerk, and a White House official said his defiant tone when he initially addressed the committee after lunch caught many in the building by surprise. \n \n But Trump was elated when Kavanaugh, whom he previously complained was not defending himself with enough force, lashed out at Democrats and the media for what Kavanaugh called casual character assassination. \n \n One senior White House official said Kavanaugh seemed to have tapped into a key element of Trump\u2019s own personal style: hit back hard and without apology. \n \n \u201cWhat do you like to drink, Senator?\u201d Kavanaugh angrily asked one questioner, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). \n \n \u201cI think he\u2019s studied the way people around Donald Trump have been treated and he figured out a way to prevail,\u201d said the official. The official confirmed that Trump had watched and relished Kavanaugh\u2019s combative opening statement, which the official called \u201csuperb.\u201d \n \n poster=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201809/770/1155968404_5841121077001_5841119722001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true \n \n Some of Kavanaugh\u2019s rhetoric also echoed comments of the president at a news conference the day earlier, in which Trump lambasted Democrats for allegedly manufacturing false allegations in what Trump called a \u201ccon job.\u201d Both Trump and Kavanaugh also suggested that men accused of sexual misconduct had lost the presumption of innocence, and that higher principles of due process and public service were at stake. \n \n The senior White House official added that Kavanaugh\u2019s approach also echoed the defiant response of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who survived public charges of sexual harassment that played out during his nationally televised 1991 confirmation hearings. \n \n It remained unclear by evening whether Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination would survive an astonishing day that covered everything from alleged rape to drinking games, the geography of Bethesda, Maryland, and crass high school yearbook jokes. But the day\u2019s end, the mood in the White House was considerably brighter than it had been earlier, when some officials cringed at the role of Arizona prosecutor Rachel Mitchell, who led the GOP side\u2019s questioning of Ford. \n \n \u201cThat\u2019s a disaster,\u201d said one administration official. The official argued that Republican lawmakers had erred by caving to the pressures of identity politics and hiring a woman to quiz Ford to avoid having an all-white male lineup of Republicans question her. \n \n Trump allies also recognized the bad optics of a prosecutor seeming to interrogate a victim who even some committee Republicans later acknowledged had come across as sympathetic. Mitchell approached Ford with a patient tone, but seemed to be searching for holes in Ford\u2019s story as she asked about her air travel \u2014 Ford has said the alleged assault left her claustrophobic and uncomfortable in airplanes \u2014 and who paid for and advised her to take a polygraph test. \n \n Trump allies who want to see Kavanaugh confirmed also were concerned that Mitchell failed to poke any substantial holes in Ford's account or character that would make her story less believable. During her questioning, Mitchell herself acknowledged that the day's format \u2014 in which she was able to question Ford in five-minute intervals \u2014 was not an ideal way to assess an alleged victim's story. \n \n But not all White House aides and officials were so unhappy about Ford\u2019s testimony in the first half of the day. One White House official and another person close to the confirmation process noted that, despite emotional responses on TV and via social media to the day's hearing, the key audience is a limited number of Republican senators. They include Jeff Flake, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. Those senators have expressed a desire for a no-drama, fair hearing, and the sources said they felt Mitchell was delivering that. \n \n The two sources also noted that the hearing had failed to produce any new facts that might incriminate Kavanaugh. And midway through the 53-year-old judge\u2019s testimony, he had made no obvious stumbles or admissions of wrongdoing. \n \n Trump aides were \u201cparticularly impressed,\u201d said one of the White House officials, when Kavanaugh told senators that his 10-year-old daughter had recently said at bedtime that she and her sister should pray for Ford. \n \n poster=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201809/3042/1155968404_5841153123001_5841150714001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" \n \n And after Sen. Lindsey Graham launched a dramatic tirade against committee Democrats who he said \u201cwant \u2026 to destroy this guy\u2019s life,\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders cheered him on via Twitter. White House aides said they felt Graham had articulated their own anger over the personal charges against Kavanaugh, including Graham\u2019s charge, delivered at a near-shout, that \u201cWhat you want to do is destroy this guy's life, hold this seat open, and hope you win in 2020.\u201d \n \n At least one conservative legal activist distributed talking points early in the day defending Mitchell and noting Ford conceded to her that she must have been given a ride to and from the party where she says Kavanaugh assaulted her but could not remember who might have done so. \u201cWhoever drove [Ford] home doesn't exist,\" the activist argued. The talking points also noted that a polygraph test Ford took and passed could be invalid because it was administered around the time of her grandmother\u2019s funeral. The talking points also noted that Mitchell had managed to prove that \"there was no witness to support what she's alleging happened.\u201d \n \n At the day\u2019s outset, Republicans expressed resignation that Kavanaugh had mishandled the situation from the beginning, by trying to portray himself as a choir boy instead of admitting that he drank heavily in high school, college and law school, as multiple classmates and yearbook entries have shown. A better strategy, White House officials conceded, would have been to admit he didn\u2019t remember the assault described by Ford, but that he believed her story and issue her an apology. \n \n White House officials said they saw his decision to sit for an interview with Fox News on Monday as a mistake. And that a better way to have handled the accusations would have been as Trump did after the release of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape in October 2016: a quick apology and then a forceful forging ahead. \n \n \u201cHe feels for Brett, the person,\u201d one person familiar with Trump\u2019s thinking said early in the day, noting that Trump sees it as Kavanaugh\u2019s job to defend his own name. \n \n \u201cWhen he\u2019s accused, he punches back,\u201d the person said. \n \n By the day\u2019s end, Kavanaugh had done the same \u2014 winning the president\u2019s support, even if his nomination remained in the balance. \n \n Christopher Cadelago contributed to this report. \n \n CORRECTION: This article has been updated to correct the spelling of Sen.

    "document": "Last week, the bitcoin community heard about UCLA professor Bhagwan Chowdhry, who had been invited by the Prize Committee for the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel to nominate someone for the 2016 Prize, suggesting nominating bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto for the Nobel Prize in Economics. But, as we also reported, the nomination by Chowdhry itself proved counterproductive when a comment underneath the professor\u2019s post explained that Nobel Foundation rules forbid public disclosure of nominations for 50 years i.e. the finance professor\u2019s announcement meant he couldn\u2019t nominate Nakamoto. \n \n Apart from Chowdhry\u2019s disclosure, it seems Nakamoto wouldn\u2019t be eligible for the Nobel Prize without a verified identity. Hans Reuterski\u00f6ld, Nobel Press Officer of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, told Inverse that the prize cannot be awarded anonymously or posthumously. \n \n There\u2019s always the possibility of Nakamoto revealing his identity sometime over the next year. However, given that he\u2019s remained anonymous for this long, it\u2019s probably a long shot. \n \n Image source ||||| Even as his face towered 10 feet above the crowd at the Bitcoin Investor\u2019s Conference in Las Vegas, Craig Steven Wright was, to most of the audience of crypto and finance geeks, a nobody. \n \n The 44-year-old Australian, Skyping into the D Hotel ballroom\u2019s screen, wore the bitcoin enthusiast\u2019s equivalent of camouflage: a black blazer and a tieless, rumpled shirt, his brown hair neatly parted. His name hadn\u2019t made the conference\u2019s list of \"featured speakers.\" Even the panel\u2019s moderator, a bitcoin blogger named Michele Seven, seemed concerned the audience wouldn\u2019t know why he was there. Wright had hardly begun to introduce himself as a \"former academic who does research that no one ever hears about,\" when she interrupted him. \n \n \"Hold on a second, who are you?\" Seven cut in, laughing. \"Are you a computer scientist?\" \n \n \"I\u2019m a bit of everything,\" Wright responded. \"I have a master's in law\u2026a master\u2019s in statistics, a couple doctorates...\" \n \n \"How did you first learn about bitcoin?\" Seven interrupted again, as if still trying to clarify Wright\u2019s significance. \n \n Wright paused for three full seconds. \"Um. I\u2019ve been involved with all this for a long time,\" he stuttered. \"I\u2014try and stay\u2014I keep my head down. Um...\" He seemed to suppress a smile. The panel\u2019s moderator moved on. And for what must have been the thousandth time in his last seven years of obscurity, Wright did not say the words WIRED\u2019s study of Wright over the past weeks suggests he may be dying to say out loud. \n \n \"I am Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of bitcoin.\" \n \n Either Wright invented bitcoin, or he's a brilliant hoaxer who very badly wants us to believe he did. \n \n Since that pseudonymous figure first released bitcoin\u2019s code on January 9th, 2009, Nakamoto\u2019s ingenious digital currency has grown from a nerd novelty to a kind of economic miracle. As it\u2019s been adopted for everything from international money transfers to online narcotrafficking, the total value of all bitcoins has grown to nearly $5 billion. Nakamoto himself, whoever he is, appears to control a stash of bitcoins easily worth a nine-figure fortune (it rose to more than a billion at the cryptocurrency\u2019s peak exchange rate in 2014). But the true identity of bitcoin\u2019s creator remains a cipher. Media outlets from the New Yorker to Fast Company to Newsweek have launched investigations into unmasking Nakamoto that were either inconclusive or, in Newsweek\u2019s case, pointed to a man who subsequently denied having anything to do with cryptography, not to mention cryptocurrency. Altogether, the world\u2019s Satoshi-seekers have hardly put a dent in one of the most stubborn mysteries of the 21st century, one whose answer could resonate beyond a small sphere of crypto geeks and have real economic effects. \n \n In the last weeks, WIRED has obtained the strongest evidence yet of Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s true identity. The signs point to Craig Steven Wright, a man who never even made it onto any Nakamoto hunters\u2019 public list of candidates, yet fits the cryptocurrency creator\u2019s profile in nearly every detail. And despite a massive trove of evidence, we still can\u2019t say with absolute certainty that the mystery is solved. But two possibilities outweigh all others: Either Wright invented bitcoin, or he\u2019s a brilliant hoaxer who very badly wants us to believe he did. \n \n The Evidence \n \n The first evidence pointing to Wright appeared in mid-November, when an anonymous source close to Wright began leaking documents to Gwern Branwen, a pseudonymous, independent security researcher and dark web analyst. Branwen provided those documents to WIRED, and they immediately led to several direct, publicly visible connections between Nakamoto and Wright: \n \n An August 2008 post on Wright\u2019s blog, months before the November 2008 introduction of the bitcoin whitepaper on a cryptography mailing list. It mentions his intention to release a \"cryptocurrency paper,\" and references \"triple entry accounting,\" the title of a 2005 paper by financial cryptographer Ian Grigg that outlines several bitcoin-like ideas. \n \n A post on the same blog from November, 2008. It includes a request that readers who want to get in touch encrypt their messages to him using a PGP public key apparently linked to Satoshi Nakamoto. A PGP key is a unique string of characters that allows a user of that encryption software to receive encrypted messages. This one, when checked against the database of the MIT server where it was stored, is associated with the email address satoshin@vistomail.com, an email address very similar to the satoshi@vistomail.com address Nakamoto used to send the whitepaper introducing bitcoin to a cryptography mailing list. \n \n An archived copy of a now-deleted blog post from Wright dated January 10, 2009, which reads: \"The Beta of Bitcoin is live tomorrow. This is decentralized... We try until it works.\" (The post was dated January 10, 2009, a day after Bitcoin\u2019s official launch on January 9th of that year. But if Wright, living in Eastern Australia, posted it after midnight his time on the night of the 9th, that would have still been before bitcoin\u2019s launch at 3pm EST on the 9th.) That post was later replaced with the rather cryptic text \"Bitcoin - AKA bloody nosey you be\u2026It does always surprise me how at times the best place to hide [is] right in the open.\" Sometime after October of this year, it was deleted entirely. \n \n WIRED \n \n In addition to those three blog posts, we received a cache of leaked emails, transcripts, and accounting forms that corroborate the link. There\u2019s a leaked message from Wright to his lawyer date June 2008 in which Wright imagines \"a P2P distributed ledger\"\u2014an apparent reference to bitcoin\u2019s public record of transactions known as the blockchain, long before it was publicly released. The email goes on to reference a paper called \"Electronic Cash Without a Trusted Third Party\" that Wright expects to release in 2009. \n \n 'I did my best to try and hide the fact that I've been running bitcoin since 2009. By the end of this I think half the world is going to bloody know.' Craig Steven Wright \n \n Another leaked email from Wright to computer forensics analyst David Kleiman, a close friend and confidant, just before bitcoin\u2019s January 2009 launch discusses a paper they\u2019d been working on together. Wright talks about taking a buyout from his job and investing in hundreds of computer processors to \"get [his] idea going.\" There\u2019s also a PDF authored by Kleiman, who died in April of 2013, in which he agrees to take control of a trust fund, codenamed the \"Tulip Trust,\" containing 1.1 million bitcoins. The PDF is signed with Kleiman\u2019s PGP signature, a cryptographic technique that ensures it couldn\u2019t have been altered post-signature. \n \n That million-coin trove\u2014The Tulip Trust\u2014is the same size as a mysterious bitcoin fortune that\u2019s long been visible on bitcoin\u2019s blockchain and widely attributed to Satoshi Nakamoto. No one but Nakamoto is known to have assembled such a massive hoard of the cryptocurrency, and only Nakamoto could have generated so many bitcoins so early in its evolution, when a bitcoin could be \u201cmined\u201d with relatively small amounts of processing power. Only one such bitcoin megapile exists, and the closely-watched coins haven\u2019t moved in bitcoin\u2019s entire history. \n \n Another clue as to Wright\u2019s bitcoin fortune wasn\u2019t leaked to WIRED but instead remains hosted on the website of the corporate advisory firm McGrathNicol: a liquidation report on one of several companies Wright founded known as Hotwire, an attempt to create a bitcoin-based bank. It shows that the startup was backed in June 2013 by $23 million in bitcoins owned by Wright. That sum would be worth more than $60 million today. At the time of the company\u2019s incorporation, Wright\u2019s investment in that one firm alone represented more than 1.5 percent of all existing bitcoins, a strangely large stash for an unknown player in the bitcoin world. \n \n The giveaways go on: There\u2019s a leaked email from Wright to an associate in January 2014 about a tax dispute with the Australian government. In it, he seems to consider using Nakamoto\u2019s name to wield influence with New South Wales Senator Arthur Sinodinos \"Would our Japanese friend have weight coming out of retirement?\" Wright asks. It includes a draft email to the senator signed \"Satoshi Nakamoto.\" And a leaked transcript of Wright\u2019s meeting with attorneys and tax officials in February 2014 quotes him in a moment of exasperation: \"I did my best to try and hide the fact that I've been running bitcoin since 2009,\" Wright says. \"By the end of this I think half the world is going to bloody know.\" \n \n Making Contact \n \n On December 1st, WIRED sent an encrypted email to Wright suggesting that we knew his secret and asking for a meeting. A few hours later, we received a wary response from the address Tessier-Ashpool@AnonymousSpeech.com, a cyberpunk reference to a rich and powerful corporate dynasty in William Gibson\u2019s Sprawl trilogy. Wright had referenced the same fictional family in the bio of his private twitter profile. The email\u2019s IP showed that it came from an IP address in Panama controlled by Vistomail, the same service that Satoshi Nakamoto had used to send his emails introducing bitcoin and to run Bitcoin.org. \u201cThis is a throw away account. There are ways even with [the anonymity software] Tor, but the people in Panama are exteremly [sic] good and do not violate people's desired privacy,\u201d the email read. \u201cYou are digging, the question is how deep are you?\u201d The message ended, \u201cRegards, the Director of Tessier-Ashpool\u201d \n \n After WIRED sent an encrypted email to Wright suggesting that we knew his secret, we received a perplexing message: 'You seem to know a few things. More than you should.' \n \n A few hours later, we received another, even more perplexing message from the same account. \u201cThe nature of this moniker is selected for a purpose. I now have resources. This makes me a we now. I am still within that early phase of learning just what my capabilities happen to be. So, even now with resources I remain vulnerable,\u201d it read. \u201cYou seem to know a few things. More than you should.\u201d \n \n When we responded by describing the three blog posts that showed Wright\u2019s clear connection to bitcoin\u2019s creation and asking again for a meeting, he gave a revealing answer. \u201cAlthough we all desire some level of credit, I have moved past many of these things,\u201d read his response from the same Tessier-Ashpool account. \u201cToo many already know secrets, the world does not need to know. There are other means to lead change than to be a dictator.\u201d \n \n After our second followup message asking for a chance to talk, Wright responded that he would consider our request. Then he stopped responding altogether. \n \n Dropping Breadcrumbs? \n \n Despite that overwhelming collection of clues, none of it fully proves that Wright is Nakamoto. All of it could be an elaborate hoax\u2014perhaps orchestrated by Wright himself. The unverified leaked documents could be faked in whole or in part. And most inexplicably of all, comparisons of different archived versions of the three smoking gun posts from Wright\u2019s blog show that he did edit all three\u2014to insert evidence of his bitcoin history. The PGP key associated with Nakamoto\u2019s email address and references to an upcoming \"cryptocurrency paper\" and \"triple entry accounting\" were added sometime after 2013. Even the post noting bitcoin\u2019s beta launch is questionable. While it was ostensibly posted in January 2009, it later seems to have been deleted and then undeleted\u2014or possibly even written for the first time\u2014sometime between October 2013 and June of 2014. \n \n Wright\u2019s blog, his public records, and his verified writings on mail lists and Twitter sketch a man who matches with Satoshi Nakamoto's known characteristics well enough to place him leagues above other candidates. \n \n Why those breadcrumbs were dropped remains a mystery. Is Wright trying to falsely steal Nakamoto\u2019s glory (or money)? Is he quietly revealing himself as bitcoin\u2019s creator? \n \n But this much is clear: If Wright is seeking to fake his Nakamoto connection, his hoax would be practically as ambitious as bitcoin itself. Some of the clues added to his blog were made more than 20 months ago\u2014a very patient deception if it were one. His references to Grigg\u2019s \"triple entry accounting\" paper would represent an uncannily inventive lie, representing a new and obscure possible inspiration for bitcoin. And there\u2019s little doubt Wright is a certified bitcoin mogul. Even the $60 million portion of his cryptocurrency stash that\u2019s verifiable in McGrathNicol\u2019s public audit record is suspiciously large. \n \n More circumstantially, Wright\u2019s blog, his public records, and his verified writings on mail lists and Twitter sketch a man who matches with Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s known characteristics well enough to place him leagues above other candidates. He\u2019s a former subscriber to the 1990s \"cypherpunks\" mailing list devoted to anti-authoritarianism and encryption, an advocate of gold as a financial tool, an accomplished C++ coder, a security professional plausibly capable of writing a tough-to-hack protocol like bitcoin, a libertarian who battled with tax authorities, and a fan of Japanese culture. \n \n He is also\u2014parallels to Nakamoto aside\u2014a strange and remarkable person: an almost obsessive autodidact and double-PhD who once boasted of obtaining new graduate degrees at a rate of about one a year. He\u2019s a climate-change denier, a serial entrepreneur who started companies ranging from security consultancies to a bitcoin bank, and an eccentric who wrote on his blog that he once accepted a challenge to create a pencil from scratch and spent years on the problem, going so far as to make his own bricks to build his own kiln in which to mix the pencil\u2019s graphite. \n \n Wright\u2019s blogging and leaked emails describe a man so committed to an unproven cryptocurrency idea that he mortgaged three properties and invested more than $1 million in computers, power, and connectivity\u2014even going so far as to lay fiberoptic cables to his remote rural home in eastern Australia to mine the first bitcoins. His company, Tulip Trading, built two supercomputers that have officially ranked among the top 500 in the world, both seemingly related to his cryptocurrency projects. (Wright seems to enjoy tulip references, a likely taunt at those who have compared bitcoin to the Netherlands\u2019 17th century \"tulip bubble.\") The first of those supercomputers he named Sukuriputo Okane\u2014Japanese for \"script money.\" Another, named Co1n, holds the title of the world\u2019s most powerful privately owned supercomputer. As Wright told the Bitcoin Investor\u2019s conference, he\u2019s applying that second machine towards the mysterious task of \"modeling Bitcoin\u2019s scalability,\" and meanwhile building an even more powerful supercomputing cluster in Iceland because of its cheap geothermal power. \n \n Bitcoin watchers have long wondered why the giant cache of coins they attribute to Satoshi Nakamoto never moved on the bitcoin\u2019s publicly visible blockchain. Wright\u2019s \"Tulip\" trust fund of 1.1 million bitcoins may hold the key to that mystery. The trust fund PDF signed by Wright\u2019s late friend David Kleiman keeps those coins locked in place until 2020, yet gives Wright the freedom to borrow them for applications including \"research into peer-to-peer systems\" and \"commercial activities that enhance the value and position of bitcoin.\" \n \n Despite those exceptions to the trust\u2019s rules, the million-coin hoard has yet to budge, even after Kleiman\u2019s death in 2013. That may be because Wright could be keeping the coins in place as an investment. He could be leveraging the trust in less visible ways, like legally transferring ownership of money to fund his companies while still leaving it at the same bitcoin address. Or he might still be waiting for January 1st, 2020, a countdown to a date that could take the lid off the biggest cryptocurrency fortune in history. \n \n Coming Clean \n \n In spite of all the clues as to Wright\u2019s possible secret life\u2014some that he apparently placed himself\u2014Wright has demonstrated such a talent for obfuscation and a love of privacy that he\u2019s never even raised the suspicions of most Nakamoto-worshipping bitcoiners. \"If we don't want to go out there and say \u2018I\u2019m a billionaire,\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m running XYZ,\u2019 or \u2018this is my life,\u2019 I shouldn't have to tell people that,\" Wright told the Las Vegas crowd in October when an audience member asked his thoughts about what bitcoin means for property rights. \"We should be able to choose how we live.\" \n \n In the leaked emails, Wright seems to bristle at the few times anyone has attempted to out bitcoin\u2019s creator. \"I am not from the bloody USA! Nor am I called Dorien [sic],\" reads a message from Wright to a colleague dated March 6, 2014. That\u2019s the same day as Newsweek\u2019s largely discredited story claimed the inventor of bitcoin to be the American Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto. \n \n If Wright is bitcoin's creator, the revelation of his work carries more importance than merely sating the curiosity of a few million geeks. \n \n Wright seemed to take personal offense at the Newsweek story. \"I do not want to be your posterboy. I am not found and I do not want to be,\" he writes in another message the same day. The email, addressed to a colleague and titled \"please leak,\" may have been an early draft of the Nakamoto\u2019s posted denial of Newsweek\u2019s story. That public denial, a rare message from Nakamoto posted from his account on the P2P Foundation forum, simply read \u201cI am not Dorian Nakamoto.\u201d But Wright\u2019s private response was far angrier. \"Stop looking... Do you know what privacy means? A gift freely given is just that and no more!\" \n \n At times, however, Wright has seemed practically envious of Nakamoto. \"People love my secret identity and hate me,\" he complained to Kleiman in a leaked email from 2011. \"I have hundreds of papers. Satoshi has one. Nothing, just one bloody paper and I [can\u2019t] associate myself with ME!\" \n \n If Wright is bitcoin\u2019s creator, the revelation of his work carries more importance than merely sating the curiosity of a few million geeks. The bitcoin economy would need to consider that if his million-bitcoin trust unlocks in 2020, Wright and those to whom he may have assigned hundreds of thousands of bitcoins would be free to sell them on the open market, potentially tanking the cryptocurrency\u2019s price; debates within the bitcoin community like the current fracas over bitcoin\u2019s \"block size\u201d may look to long-lost Nakamoto for guidance; the world would have to grapple with the full scope of Wright's vision when he unleashes the result of his companies' post-bitcoin research. The other suspected Satoshis may finally get a reprieve from nosey reporters like us. And the intellectual history of cryptocurrencies would be forever rewritten. \n \n Wright himself, despite his hostile response to Satoshi-seekers, has lately seemed to be dropping clues of a double life. In the last two years he\u2019s started to write more frequently about bitcoin on his blog; he\u2019s even peppered Twitter with hints (Though he also deleted many of those earlier this month and made his tweets private.) \n \n \"'Identity' is not your name. Where people go wrong is that they do not see it to be the set of shared experiences with other individuals,\" he wrote in one tweet in October. \n \n When a UCLA professor nominated Satoshi Nakamoto for a Nobel Prize earlier this month\u2014and he was declared ineligible due to the mystery of his identity\u2014Wright lashed out. \"If Satoshi-chan was made for an ACM turing price [sic] or an Alfred Nobel in Economics he would let you bloody know that,\" he wrote on twitter, using the Japanese \"chan\" suffix that indicates familiarity or a nickname. \n \n \"I never desired to be a leader but the choice is not mine,\" reads a third recent tweet from Wright. \"We are a product of the things we create. They change us.\" \n \n In one cryptic and meandering blog post in September in which Wright takes stock of his long career, he even seems to concede that no one can build and wield the wealth that Satoshi Nakamoto has amassed and remain hidden indefinitely. \"There is a certain power and mystery in secrets,\" Wright mused. \n \n \"Am slowly coming to the realisation and acceptance,\" he added, \"No secret remains forever.\" \n \n Update 12/14/2015 2:40pm: New clues following the publication of this story have shown inconsistencies in Wright's academic and supercomputing claims that may point to the second, strange possibility we noted: an elaborate, long-planned hoax. \n \n You may also like: ||||| The identity of \"Satoshi Nakamoto\", the pseudonym of the mysterious individual or group that created the concept of Bitcoin in late 2009, has been the subject of frenzied investigation by the currency's enthusiasts and the tech press for years. It turns out that the shadowy figure behind the digital alternative currency may be from Australia, and living in Sydney. \n \n UPDATE: The house belonging to Craig Wright in North Ryde has been raided by police, The Guardian reports. \n \n Bitcoin image via Shutterstock \n \n A month-long Gizmodo investigation into Dr Craig Wright and the late Dave Kleiman, an American computer forensics expert who died in 2013, has revealed that they were almost certainly involved in the creation of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency protocol. Wright, from North Ryde in Sydney, is a cryptocurrency enthusiast and serial entrepreneur. \n \n Wired has gathered enough evidence to suggest that Wright is the cryptocurrency's creator that it's confident in naming him publicly; it's not certain of its discovery, but it's more than confident \u2014 pointing to blog posts made by Wright before the public unveiling of the Bitcoin protocol, as well as his apparent ownership of a 1.1 million bitcoin blockchain worth $605,000,000. \n \n In the last weeks, WIRED has obtained the strongest evidence yet of Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s true identity. The signs point to Craig Steven Wright, a man who never even made it onto any Nakamoto hunters\u2019 public list of candidates, yet fits the cryptocurrency creator\u2019s profile in nearly every detail. And despite a massive trove of evidence, we still can\u2019t say with absolute certainty that the mystery is solved. But two possibilities outweigh all others: Either Wright invented bitcoin, or he\u2019s a brilliant hoaxer... \n \n Possibly the strongest evidence is a leaked email about an alleged tax dispute that Wright had with the Australian government, where the self-described \"security nerd, economist and researcher\" supposedly suggests using Satoshi Nakamoto's identity to reach out to then-New South Wales senator Arthur Sinodinos: \"Would our Japanese friend have weight coming out of retirement?\" \n \n Wright lists DeMorgan Ltd in his Twitter profile, a company \"focused on alternative currency\" with \"several Bitcoin based research projects\". The Australian Securities and Investment Commission proposed to deregister DeMorgan in June 2014 after its initial registration in January to an address in North Ryde in Sydney's northwest. The company's ABN, registered to an address in Wauchope near Port Macquarie and previously trading as \"Vin De La Terre\", was cancelled in late October this year. \n \n Wright is also the founder and CEO of Cloudcroft, an Australian supercomputing firm whose Tulip Trading C01N is currently ranked at #17 in the supercomputing world's Top 500 list. Here's a video where Dr Wright introduces Cloudcroft and C01N, a high-performance computing cluster designed for finance and apparently built in North Ryde in partnership with SGI, with 115,200 CPU cores and 146TB of main memory. Gizmodo has contacted SGI to confirm this information. Gizmodo Australia has also reached out to Dr Wright for comment. \n \n Questions, comments, tips? You can find me on Twitter at @csimps0n. ||||| Even as his face towered 10 feet above the crowd at the Bitcoin Investor\u2019s Conference in Las Vegas, Craig Steven Wright was, to most of the audience of crypto and finance geeks, a nobody. \n \n The 44-year-old Australian, Skyping into the D Hotel ballroom\u2019s screen, wore the bitcoin enthusiast\u2019s equivalent of camouflage: a black blazer and a tieless, rumpled shirt, his brown hair neatly parted. His name hadn\u2019t made the conference\u2019s list of \"featured speakers.\" Even the panel\u2019s moderator, a bitcoin blogger named Michele Seven, seemed concerned the audience wouldn\u2019t know why he was there. Wright had hardly begun to introduce himself as a \"former academic who does research that no one ever hears about,\" when she interrupted him. \n \n \"Hold on a second, who are you?\" Seven cut in, laughing. \"Are you a computer scientist?\" \n \n \"I\u2019m a bit of everything,\" Wright responded. \"I have a master's in law\u2026a master\u2019s in statistics, a couple doctorates...\" \n \n \"How did you first learn about bitcoin?\" Seven interrupted again, as if still trying to clarify Wright\u2019s significance. \n \n Wright paused for three full seconds. \"Um. I\u2019ve been involved with all this for a long time,\" he stuttered. \"I\u2014try and stay\u2014I keep my head down. Um...\" He seemed to suppress a smile. The panel\u2019s moderator moved on. And for what must have been the thousandth time in his last seven years of obscurity, Wright did not say the words WIRED\u2019s study of Wright over the past weeks suggests he may be dying to say out loud. \n \n \"I am Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of bitcoin.\" \n \n Either Wright invented bitcoin, or he's a brilliant hoaxer who very badly wants us to believe he did. \n \n Since that pseudonymous figure first released bitcoin\u2019s code on January 9th, 2009, Nakamoto\u2019s ingenious digital currency has grown from a nerd novelty to a kind of economic miracle. As it\u2019s been adopted for everything from international money transfers to online narcotrafficking, the total value of all bitcoins has grown to nearly $5 billion. Nakamoto himself, whoever he is, appears to control a stash of bitcoins easily worth a nine-figure fortune (it rose to more than a billion at the cryptocurrency\u2019s peak exchange rate in 2014). But the true identity of bitcoin\u2019s creator remains a cipher. Media outlets from the New Yorker to Fast Company to Newsweek have launched investigations into unmasking Nakamoto that were either inconclusive or, in Newsweek\u2019s case, pointed to a man who subsequently denied having anything to do with cryptography, not to mention cryptocurrency. Altogether, the world\u2019s Satoshi-seekers have hardly put a dent in one of the most stubborn mysteries of the 21st century, one whose answer could resonate beyond a small sphere of crypto geeks and have real economic effects. \n \n In the last weeks, WIRED has obtained the strongest evidence yet of Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s true identity. The signs point to Craig Steven Wright, a man who never even made it onto any Nakamoto hunters\u2019 public list of candidates, yet fits the cryptocurrency creator\u2019s profile in nearly every detail.

More than you should.\u201d \n \n When we responded by describing the three blog posts that showed Wright\u2019s clear connection to bitcoin\u2019s creation and asking again for a meeting, he gave a revealing answer. \u201cAlthough we all desire some level of credit, I have moved past many of these things,\u201d read his response from the same Tessier-Ashpool account. \u201cToo many already know secrets, the world does not need to know. There are other means to lead change than to be a dictator.\u201d \n \n After our second followup message asking for a chance to talk, Wright responded that he would consider our request. Then he stopped responding altogether. \n \n Dropping Breadcrumbs? \n \n Despite that overwhelming collection of clues, none of it fully proves that Wright is Nakamoto. All of it could be an elaborate hoax\u2014perhaps orchestrated by Wright himself. The unverified leaked documents could be faked in whole or in part. And most inexplicably of all, comparisons of different archived versions of the three smoking gun posts from Wright\u2019s blog show that he did edit all three\u2014to insert evidence of his bitcoin history. The PGP key associated with Nakamoto\u2019s email address and references to an upcoming \"cryptocurrency paper\" and \"triple entry accounting\" were added sometime after 2013. Even the post noting bitcoin\u2019s beta launch is questionable. While it was ostensibly posted in January 2009, it later seems to have been deleted and then undeleted\u2014or possibly even written for the first time\u2014sometime between October 2013 and June of 2014. \n \n Wright\u2019s blog, his public records, and his verified writings on mail lists and Twitter sketch a man who matches with Satoshi Nakamoto's known characteristics well enough to place him leagues above other candidates. \n \n Why those breadcrumbs were dropped remains a mystery. Is Wright trying to falsely steal Nakamoto\u2019s glory (or money)? Is he quietly revealing himself as bitcoin\u2019s creator? \n \n But this much is clear: If Wright is seeking to fake his Nakamoto connection, his hoax would be practically as ambitious as bitcoin itself. Some of the clues added to his blog were made more than 20 months ago\u2014a very patient deception if it were one. His references to Grigg\u2019s \"triple entry accounting\" paper would represent an uncannily inventive lie, representing a new and obscure possible inspiration for bitcoin. And there\u2019s little doubt Wright is a certified bitcoin mogul. Even the $60 million portion of his cryptocurrency stash that\u2019s verifiable in McGrathNicol\u2019s public audit record is suspiciously large. \n \n More circumstantially, Wright\u2019s blog, his public records, and his verified writings on mail lists and Twitter sketch a man who matches with Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s known characteristics well enough to place him leagues above other candidates. He\u2019s a former subscriber to the 1990s \"cypherpunks\" mailing list devoted to anti-authoritarianism and encryption, an advocate of gold as a financial tool, an accomplished C++ coder, a security professional plausibly capable of writing a tough-to-hack protocol like bitcoin, a libertarian who battled with tax authorities, and a fan of Japanese culture. \n \n He is also\u2014parallels to Nakamoto aside\u2014a strange and remarkable person: an almost obsessive autodidact and double-PhD who once boasted of obtaining new graduate degrees at a rate of about one a year. He\u2019s a climate-change denier, a serial entrepreneur who started companies ranging from security consultancies to a bitcoin bank, and an eccentric who wrote on his blog that he once accepted a challenge to create a pencil from scratch and spent years on the problem, going so far as to make his own bricks to build his own kiln in which to mix the pencil\u2019s graphite. \n \n Wright\u2019s blogging and leaked emails describe a man so committed to an unproven cryptocurrency idea that he mortgaged three properties and invested more than $1 million in computers, power, and connectivity\u2014even going so far as to lay fiberoptic cables to his remote rural home in eastern Australia to mine the first bitcoins. His company, Tulip Trading, built two supercomputers that have officially ranked among the top 500 in the world, both seemingly related to his cryptocurrency projects. (Wright seems to enjoy tulip references, a likely taunt at those who have compared bitcoin to the Netherlands\u2019 17th century \"tulip bubble.\") The first of those supercomputers he named Sukuriputo Okane\u2014Japanese for \"script money.\" Another, named Co1n, holds the title of the world\u2019s most powerful privately owned supercomputer. As Wright told the Bitcoin Investor\u2019s conference, he\u2019s applying that second machine towards the mysterious task of \"modeling Bitcoin\u2019s scalability,\" and meanwhile building an even more powerful supercomputing cluster in Iceland because of its cheap geothermal power. \n \n Bitcoin watchers have long wondered why the giant cache of coins they attribute to Satoshi Nakamoto never moved on the bitcoin\u2019s publicly visible blockchain. Wright\u2019s \"Tulip\" trust fund of 1.1 million bitcoins may hold the key to that mystery. The trust fund PDF signed by Wright\u2019s late friend David Kleiman keeps those coins locked in place until 2020, yet gives Wright the freedom to borrow them for applications including \"research into peer-to-peer systems\" and \"commercial activities that enhance the value and position of bitcoin.\" \n \n Despite those exceptions to the trust\u2019s rules, the million-coin hoard has yet to budge, even after Kleiman\u2019s death in 2013. That may be because Wright could be keeping the coins in place as an investment. He could be leveraging the trust in less visible ways, like legally transferring ownership of money to fund his companies while still leaving it at the same bitcoin address. Or he might still be waiting for January 1st, 2020, a countdown to a date that could take the lid off the biggest cryptocurrency fortune in history. \n \n Coming Clean \n \n In spite of all the clues as to Wright\u2019s possible secret life\u2014some that he apparently placed himself\u2014Wright has demonstrated such a talent for obfuscation and a love of privacy that he\u2019s never even raised the suspicions of most Nakamoto-worshipping bitcoiners. \"If we don't want to go out there and say \u2018I\u2019m a billionaire,\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m running XYZ,\u2019 or \u2018this is my life,\u2019 I shouldn't have to tell people that,\" Wright told the Las Vegas crowd in October when an audience member asked his thoughts about what bitcoin means for property rights. \"We should be able to choose how we live.\" \n \n In the leaked emails, Wright seems to bristle at the few times anyone has attempted to out bitcoin\u2019s creator. \"I am not from the bloody USA! Nor am I called Dorien [sic],\" reads a message from Wright to a colleague dated March 6, 2014. That\u2019s the same day as Newsweek\u2019s largely discredited story claimed the inventor of bitcoin to be the American Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto. \n \n If Wright is bitcoin's creator, the revelation of his work carries more importance than merely sating the curiosity of a few million geeks. \n \n Wright seemed to take personal offense at the Newsweek story. \"I do not want to be your posterboy. I am not found and I do not want to be,\" he writes in another message the same day. The email, addressed to a colleague and titled \"please leak,\" may have been an early draft of the Nakamoto\u2019s posted denial of Newsweek\u2019s story. That public denial, a rare message from Nakamoto posted from his account on the P2P Foundation forum, simply read \u201cI am not Dorian Nakamoto.\u201d But Wright\u2019s private response was far angrier. \"Stop looking... Do you know what privacy means? A gift freely given is just that and no more!\" \n \n At times, however, Wright has seemed practically envious of Nakamoto. \"People love my secret identity and hate me,\" he complained to Kleiman in a leaked email from 2011. \"I have hundreds of papers. Satoshi has one. Nothing, just one bloody paper and I [can\u2019t] associate myself with ME!\" \n \n If Wright is bitcoin\u2019s creator, the revelation of his work carries more importance than merely sating the curiosity of a few million geeks. The bitcoin economy would need to consider that if his million-bitcoin trust unlocks in 2020, Wright and those to whom he may have assigned hundreds of thousands of bitcoins would be free to sell them on the open market, potentially tanking the cryptocurrency\u2019s price; debates within the bitcoin community like the current fracas over bitcoin\u2019s \"block size\u201d may look to long-lost Nakamoto for guidance; the world would have to grapple with the full scope of Wright's vision when he unleashes the result of his companies' post-bitcoin research. The other suspected Satoshis may finally get a reprieve from nosey reporters like us. And the intellectual history of cryptocurrencies would be forever rewritten. \n \n Wright himself, despite his hostile response to Satoshi-seekers, has lately seemed to be dropping clues of a double life. In the last two years he\u2019s started to write more frequently about bitcoin on his blog; he\u2019s even peppered Twitter with hints (Though he also deleted many of those earlier this month and made his tweets private.) \n \n \"'Identity' is not your name. Where people go wrong is that they do not see it to be the set of shared experiences with other individuals,\" he wrote in one tweet in October. \n \n When a UCLA professor nominated Satoshi Nakamoto for a Nobel Prize earlier this month\u2014and he was declared ineligible due to the mystery of his identity\u2014Wright lashed out. \"If Satoshi-chan was made for an ACM turing price [sic] or an Alfred Nobel in Economics he would let you bloody know that,\" he wrote on twitter, using the Japanese \"chan\" suffix that indicates familiarity or a nickname. \n \n \"I never desired to be a leader but the choice is not mine,\" reads a third recent tweet from Wright. \"We are a product of the things we create. They change us.\" \n \n In one cryptic and meandering blog post in September in which Wright takes stock of his long career, he even seems to concede that no one can build and wield the wealth that Satoshi Nakamoto has amassed and remain hidden indefinitely. \"There is a certain power and mystery in secrets,\" Wright mused. \n \n \"Am slowly coming to the realisation and acceptance,\" he added, \"No secret remains forever.\" \n \n Update 12/14/2015 2:40pm: New clues following the publication of this story have shown inconsistencies in Wright's academic and supercomputing claims that may point to the second, strange possibility we noted: an elaborate, long-planned hoax. \n \n You may also like: ||||| SYDNEY, Australia \u2014 The Australian authorities on Wednesday raided the home of a computer expert and entrepreneur in suburban Sydney, just hours after two news outlets identified the man as a likely creator of the digital currency Bitcoin. \n \n The Australian Federal Police said the raid on the residence of the man, Craig Steven Wright, was for a tax investigation, and a spokesman said it had no connection to the Bitcoin reports. The Australian Taxation Office, which asked the police to carry out the raid, declined to comment on \u201cany individual\u2019s or entity\u2019s tax affairs.\u201d \n \n The raid, in the leafy suburb of Gordon on Sydney\u2019s upper north shore, came hours after reports in Wired magazine and Gizmodo drew strong links between Mr. Wright and Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of the virtual currency that has grown to billions of dollars in total value. \n \n The identity of Mr. Nakamoto has been a mystery since the currency\u2019s computer code was released in 2009, with several false leads having been aired and debunked. The growing value of Bitcoin, which is managed by computers that run its peer-to-peer software, has driven the search for its creator or creators. \n \n Wired, which was first to identify Mr. Wright as a possible inventor of the currency, cited old blog posts as well as leaked documents and emails. The magazine acknowledged that the trail of clues could be a hoax, but it added: \u201cIf Wright is seeking to fake his Nakamoto connection, his hoax would be practically as ambitious as Bitcoin itself.\u201d \n \n The Gizmodo report said that Mr. Wright and Dave Kleiman, an American who died in 2013, \u201cwere involved in the development of the digital currency.\u201d \n \n Both outlets cited what was described as a transcript of a 2014 meeting among Mr. Wright, lawyers and tax officials, in which he is quoted as saying, \u201cI did my best to try and hide the fact that I\u2019ve been running Bitcoin since 2009.\u201d \n \n \u201cBy the end of this, I think half the world is going to bloody know,\u201d he added, according to the transcript. \n \n Efforts to reach Mr. Wright on Wednesday were unsuccessful. \n \n A Newsweek investigation in 2014 incorrectly identified the Bitcoin creator as Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, a physicist living with his mother in Southern California. He denied the report, saying he had only learned of Bitcoin weeks earlier after a reporter contacted his son.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Wired says it has uncovered \"the strongest evidence yet of Satoshi Nakamoto's true identity.\" Nakamoto, the alias for the creator of Bitcoin, has never been unmasked publicly, but Wired's Andy Greenberg and Gwern Branwen name Australian Craig Wright, 44, as the most likely candidate. \"Either Wright invented Bitcoin, or he's a brilliant hoaxer,\" they write. Australian police seem to be believers: They raided Wright's home in Sydney on Wednesday, reports the New York Times. Wired notes that Wright\u2014founder of supercomputing firm Cloudcroft, per Gizmodo\u2014blogged about releasing a \"cryptocurrency paper\" a few months before the Bitcoin white paper was revealed in November 2008, though that post was edited in 2013. He also used an encryption key linked to satoshin@vistomail.com. Nakamoto used satoshi@vistomail.com to introduce the white paper. Wright, who owns at least $60 million in Bitcoin, also has access to 1.1 million Bitcoins worth $605 million\u2014the same amount attributed to Nakamoto. \"I am not from the bloody USA! Nor am I called Dorien [sic],\" Wright wrote in a leaked email sent the same day Newsweek claimed American Dorian Nakamoto as Bitcoin's inventor. Leaked transcripts from meetings with Wright's attorneys in February 2014 also quote him as saying: \"I did my best to try and hide the fact that I've been running Bitcoin since 2009 \u2026 By the end of this I think half the world is going to bloody know.\" Then, in an odd interview at the Bitcoin Investor Conference, a moderator asked Wright how he first learned about Bitcoin. \"Um, I've been involved with all this for a long time,\" he said after a long pause. \"I\u2014try and stay\u2014I keep my head down.\" After sending an encrypted email to Wright suggesting he was Nakamoto, Wired received this response: \"You seem to know a few things. More than you should.\" With a verified identity, Nakamoto could be nominated for a 2016 Nobel Prize, per CoinReport. (Click for more from Wired.)",
    "generated_summary": "UCLA professor Bhagwan Chowdhry suggested nominating bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto for the Nobel Prize in Economics. Nobel Foundation rules forbid public disclosure of nominations for 50 years i.e. the finance professor\u2019s announcement meant he couldn\u2019t nominate Nakamoto. Satoshi-seekers have hardly put a dent in one of the most stubborn mysteries of the 21st century. But two possibilities outweigh all others: Either Craig Steven Wright invented bitcoin, or he's a brilliant hoaxer who very badly wants us to believe he did. The true identity of bitcoin's creator remains a cipher, but it's probably a long shot.",

Civil aviation authorities announced the airport will be closed for three days because of security concerns. \n \n Smoke rises on the horizon in Tripoli, Libya, early Sunday, July 13, 2014. Explosions and gunfire have been heard around the international airport in Libya's capital as airlines have canceled some international... (Associated Press) \n \n Gunfire from the battles echoed through Tripoli as fierce fighting raged between Libyan forces and allied militias and a powerful militia from the western city of Zintan that controls the airport, a member of a revolutionary battalion attached to Libya's army chief of staff that took part in the battle said. \n \n Those living in the vicinity said troops surrounded the airfield and fired rockets at buildings inside. Thick columns of black smoke rose overhead and could be seen from downtown Tripoli. \n \n The health ministry said six people were killed in the fighting and 25 were wounded. \n \n Authorities said Saturday that the airport was to have been handed over into government control. The government largely relies on the same militias to police the streets as its security forces remain in disarray. \n \n The powerful Zintan militia had taken control of the airport, providing security for the strategic installation, following the fall of longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. \n \n The militias, many of them organized to fight against Gadhafi troops, remained a powerful component in the post-war Libya, filling the void left by weak police and security and cooperating with the government to provide order. \n \n But rivalries between militias for control and resources were also the cause for fierce fighting among them; and posed a constant challenge to the central government. \n \n On Sunday, the country's civil aviation authority said the airport will be shut for three days pending the security situation, advising airlines to land at other airports in Libya. \n \n Egypt's national carrier EgyptAir said it canceled two flights Sunday to Tripoli as hundreds of travelers remained inside the airport waiting for it to re-open. Both British Airways and Turkish Airlines also canceled flights Sunday. ||||| Heavy fighting between rival militias vying for control of Libya's main airport in Tripoli has left at least seven people dead and halted all flights. \n \n Explosions and anti-aircraft gunfire were heard from early Sunday morning on the airport road and other parts of the capital until the situation seemed to calm down in the late afternoon. \n \n The fighting was the worst in Tripoli since more than 40 people were killed in clashes between militias and armed residents in November. \n \n Besides the seven fatalities, another 36 people were wounded in the clashes, the Libyan Health Ministry said. \n \n Residents said that militia members from the northwestern region of Zintan who had controlled the airport came under fire, and local TV footage suggested that the attacking rebels were from the western city of Misrata. \n \n The United Nations has said it has temporarily relocated some of its international staff out of Libya after heavy fighting broke out between rival militias vying for control of Libya's main airport. \n \n \"We can confirm a temporary relocation for security reasons,\" UN spokesman Farhan Haq said. \n \n Zintan versus Misrata \n \n Zintan forces, which have controlled the airport since Gaddafi's overthrow, and Misratis had been put on the state payroll in an unsuccessful attempt by the government to secure their cooperation and try to bolster the rule of law. \n \n Comments on pro-Misrata websites suggested that the force was freeing the airport from Zintani control to hand it over to authorities. \n \n The central government denounced the attackers as illegal. \n \n \"The operation is led by civil leaders belonging to brigades and troops ... moving without orders and legal cover,\" the government of Prime Minister Abdulllah al-Thinni said in a statement. \n \n Local news channel Al Nabaa showed men in military vehicles with Misrata insignia opening fire with heavy weapons. \n \n Heavy smoke could be seen rising above the airport as an official said: \"All domestic and international flights have been halted.\" \n \n Al Nabaa TV showed a Libyan Airlines jet and a transport aircraft engulfed in smoke while vehicles fired anti-aircraft volleys and fighters took up positions next to a field of sheep. \n \n Social media websites said that several rockets had hit the airport perimeter. \n \n Photographs on Facebook showed thick smoke at what was said to be the parking lot in front of the terminal. Families were trapped inside the building, local websites said. \n \n The violence comes as the country awaits the results of the June 25 parliamentary elections. \n \n Earlier the US warned that the conflict in Libya could be \"widespread\" following an acknowledgement by electoral officials that fraud had clouded the poll. \n \n \"The United States is deeply concerned by the ongoing violence in Libya and dangerous posturing that could lead to widespread conflict there,\" Jen Psaki, of the US state department, said on Saturday. \n \n Officials and Libya's partners had hoped the vote would give a push to state building and ease political tensions. \n \n Security concerns \n \n Tripoli has seen a surge in kidnappings but has been mostly spared the kind of violence that has rocked the eastern city of Benghazi, where clashes between self-styled Islamist groups and forces loyal to a renegade general occur almost daily. \n \n On Thursday, the UN Support Mission in Libya announced it was pulling out dozens of staff because of security concerns. \n \n Libya, an OPEC member, is divided between rival militias from urban communities and tribes, as well as Islamist and more moderate forces. \n \n Oil production has fallen to a fraction of the 1.4 million barrels a day that Libya produced before July 2013 when a wave of protests erupted at oilfields and ports. \n \n The loss of oil revenues has caused a budget crisis as Libya depends on energy exports.",

    "document": "The Coast Guard is coming down hard on the owners of a broken oil platform that has been allowed to leak off southeast Louisiana for more than 14 years. \n \n New federal estimates put the leak rate at the Taylor Energy Co. well at 10,500 gallons to 29,000 gallons of oil per day. That\u2019s five to 13 times larger than government\u2019s estimate from just a year ago, and would rank the Taylor Energy leak as one of the largest and longest-running oil spills in North America. \n \n Last week, the Coast Guard directed Taylor Energy to decide on a new containment plan and a contractor to do the work. The new method of containment \u201cmust eliminate the surface sheen and avoid the deficiencies associated with prior containment systems,\u201d the Coast Guard wrote in an administrative order. The company will be fined up to $40,000 per day for failing to comply. \n \n Full containment of the leak could cost upwards of $1 billion, according to Taylor Energy. The company disputes the new leak estimates and the cause of the chronic sheens that often stretch for miles from the well site. According to scientists employed by Taylor Energy, the sheens are caused by oil and gas bubbling up from the oil-saturated seafloor, and not from leaky wells. \n \n Site of the Taylor Energy platform. \n \n Taylor Energy\u2019s platform, known as MC-20 Saratoga, was destroyed by Hurricane Ivan on Sept. 15, 2004. The storm triggered an underwater mudslide that snapped the 550-foot-tall platform\u2019s legs and buried a cluster of wells. Taylor plugged some of the 28 wells and added three containment domes. \n \n Several environmental groups have for years disputed Taylor\u2019s claim that its multimillion-dollar containment effort had limited pollution to just a trickle. \n \n In 2013, Skytruth, an environmental group based in Shepherdstown, W. Va., that specializes in remote sensing and digital mapping, measured the sheen at more than 20 miles long. The Gulf Monitoring Consortium, made up of Skytruth and other groups, estimated a daily release rate of between 100 and 400 gallons. \n \n It wasn\u2019t until 2016 that federal regulators began investigating how oil and gas was still leaking from the site. That same year, Taylor Energy sued the federal government over the remaining $432 million from a $666 million trust, which the company was required to create to pay for the leak response. Taylor Energy argued that its response worked and that the remaining funds should be returned. \n \n 12 years after Gulf oil platform destroyed, feds start investigating environmental damage \n \n In a 2017 legal filing, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement estimated the leak\u2019s range at 42 to 2,300 gallons per day. But this year, the government cited the vastly larger daily estimate of up to 29,000 gallons. \n \n The Coast Guard noted the new rate in its recent order for additional containment work. \n \n \u201cThe worst-case estimate of the daily volume of release far exceeds previous estimates and is in the order of hundreds of barrels per day,\u201d the Coast Guard told Taylor Energy in a letter. \n \n The Coast Guard\u2019s order is long overdue, said Dustin Renaud, communications director for the Gulf Restoration Network. \n \n \u201cThe time to clean this up was 14 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cTaylor Energy has shown nothing but negligence all this time.\u201d \n \n Taylor Energy says the government won\u2019t reveal how it arrived at the much larger estimate. The Coast Guard declined to share details on the estimate with NOLA.com | Times-Picayune until it can determine whether the information is \u201cpublicly releasable.\u201d \n \n Will Pecue, Taylor Energy president, said the new estimates are \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cbased on erroneous science.\u201d He believes the larger estimates are aimed at bolstering the government\u2019s case for retaining the trust\u2019s remaining $432 million. \n \n \u201cThere is intent to dismiss the past record,\u201d he said. \n \n The wells at the Taylor Energy site were relatively low in pressure. The former platform\u2019s production of 1,100 barrels, or about 46,000 gallons, of oil per day, the company required pressurized gas injections. It\u2019s unlikely the platform site could leak at the new estimated rates without pressurization, said Christopher Reddy, a marine scientist hired by Taylor Energy to assess the site. \n \n A more likely source of the sheen is the sediment, which Reddy described as \u201cheavily contaminated\u201d with oil. Recent sediment sampling showed traces of drilling fluid, likely used during the work to plug and decommission wells after Hurricane Ivan. The sheen on the water\u2019s surface was also found to have drilling fluid. The fluid\u2019s presence indicates the sheen is coming from the sediment and not subsurface wells, which would be pure crude oil and contain no drilling fluid, Reddy said. \n \n Large sheens on the water\u2019s surface often correspond with disturbances on the seafloor, such as when a remote observation vehicle or divers collect samples. \n \n \u201cWhen you touch the bottom, you create a sheen,\u201d he said. \n \n Buried oil from Deepwater Horizon disaster still harming wetlands \n \n Reddy cautioned that any restoration or cleanup work at the site could release a large quantity of oil. \n \n Based on the high end of the new leak estimates, the site may have released 150 million gallons of oil over the past 14 years. That would make the total release on par with the estimated 168 gallons spilled during the BP oil oil disaster in 2010. But, as Taylor Energy\u2019s representatives note, the sheen has never been documented reaching the shore, nor has it caused large-scale damage to fisheries or wildlife. \n \n It doesn\u2019t take a BP-level disaster to harm the Gulf of Mexico, said Renaud of the Gulf Restoration Network. While the BP spill\u2019s impact was heavily studied, the environmental damage from the Taylor Energy leak has largely been ignored. \n \n \u201cWhen you have 10,000 to 30,000 gallons of oil leaking into the Gulf there can\u2019t help but be environmental impacts,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know what they are yet, and we need to change that.\u201d ||||| On April 20, 2010, the oil drilling rig Deepwater Horizon, operating in the Macondo Prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, exploded and sank resulting in the death of 11 workers on the Deepwater Horizon and the largest spill of oil in the history of marine oil drilling operations. 4 million barrels of oil flowed from the damaged Macondo well over an 87-day period, before it was finally capped on July 15, 2010.

Contractors commissioned by Taylor Energy had previously said the oil spill was minimal, at the most around 2,000 gallons a day. If the company doesn't comply with the Coast Guard's new decree, it could be hit with a fine of up to $40,000 per day. To put it in context, the BP Deepwater Horizon spill dumped 4 million barrels of oil into the Gulf before it was capped after 87 days in July 2010; the Taylor spill could be at 3.5 million barrels. The Taylor spill remained hidden from the public by both the company and the Coast Guard for six years after the hurricane. It was discovered only when nonprofits and environmental groups investigating the BP spill came upon oil slicks that didn't appear to be related to that particular incident. Taylor Energy\u2014which contends the oil \"sheens\" on the surface of the water aren't from leaking wells, but from oil and gas floating up from the oil-heavy seafloor\u2014says full containment of the leak could cost more than $1 billion, the Times-Picayune reports. Still, \"the time to clean this up was 14 years ago,\" a rep for the Gulf Restoration Network says. \"Taylor Energy has shown nothing but negligence all this time.\" (The largest tanker oil spill in three decades happened earlier this year.)",
    "generated_summary": "New federal estimates put the leak rate at the Taylor Energy Co. well at 10,500 gallons to 29,000 gallons of oil per day. That\u2019s five to 13 times larger than just a year ago, and would rank the leak as one of the largest and longest-running oil spills in North America. Taylor Energy disputes the new leak estimates and the cause of the chronic sheens that often stretch for miles from the well site. The company will be fined up to $40,000 per day for failing to comply with the Coast Guard's order for a new containment plan and a contractor to work on the site.",

The company is reviewing taking legal action against both KTVU-TV and the NTSB.\" \n \n \n \n Update: The NTSB has released a statement stating an intern is responsible for confirming the incorrect names. Sounds like someone's summer internship is over. \n \n KTVU has also provided further explanation into why they said these names on air: They didn't say them out loud before rattling them off during their live taping and they didn't confirm with the NTSB employee (intern) on their position within the organization. They did, however, call to verify the correct spelling of the names. \n \n \n \n Update: Peter Knudson, a spokesman for the NTSB, just confirmed to SF Weekly that the NTSB did not release the names of the pilots of flight 214 to KTVU, or any news organization, for that matter. \n \n \n \n Original Story: Local station KTVU totally screwed up the names of Asiana Flight 214 pilots when announcing them on live television today, and we're a little worried the name \"Ho Lee Fuk\" might actually go down in history. \n \n So just to correct the record: The ill-fated Boeing 777 wasn't actually being steered by Mr. Fuk and his co-pilots Sum Ting Wong, Wi Tu Lo, and Bang Ding Ow. \n \n KTVU rushed to fix the blunder and issued an apology,blaming the NTSB for the fuck-up. The apology didn't do much to stop screenshots of the offensive names from making their rounds through the blogosphere. \n \n Oh, look -- here they are: \n \n And here's a video of the newscaster announcing the names with complete sincerity -- with \"Fuk\" pronounced \"Fook,\" lest you suspect the station of impropriety: \n \n Note: Asiana actually released the names of two pilots -- the ones allegedly responsible for the botched landing -- on Sunday.

But the station was given bad information that made it all the way into the newscast. If you read the names it becomes immediately clear this is a joke, which went unnoticed by the newsroom, producers and the anchor. \n \n You\u2019ll recall earlier this week, KTVU touted its coverage as being not only first, but \u201c100% accurate.\u201d \n \n \u201cBeing first on air and on every platform in all aspects of our coverage was a great accomplishment, but being 100% accurate, effectively using our great sources and social media without putting a single piece of erroneous information on our air, is what we are most proud of as a newsroom,\u201d said News Director Lee Rosenthal at the time. Watch: \n \n About 15 minutes later the station corrected its mistake, but claimed an NTSB official had confirmed the names. \n \n Earlier in the newscast we gave some names of pilots involved in the Asiana Airlines crash. These names were not accurate despite an NTSB official in Washington confirming them late this morning. We apologize for this error. \n \n > More: Further apology from KTVU president & GM Tom Raponi: \u201cWe sincerely regret the error and took immediate action to apologize, both in the newscast where the mistake occurred, as well as on our website and social media sites.

Some key cities -- including Chicago, New York and Washington, DC -- aren't on the list . Is there another way to finagle free Internet from the terminal? Yes , says Lifehacker's servicey team.

Google said will be offering free Wi-Fi to travelers across the United States starting Tuesday at 47 airports. Google says the Wi-Fi will be available until January 15, 2010. Google says it will also extend the free Wi-Fi offer to Virgin America flights within the continental United States. \n \n For a complete list of participating airports visit Google's dedicated Free Wi-Fi for the Holidays Website. \n \n The FAA estimates 100 million people will travel back and forth across the country during the holidays, and those hunkered down in airport terminals due to weather delays will likely appreciate the free Wi-Fi. \n \n Google has partnered with airports across the country, as well as Time Warner Cable, Boingo Wireless, Advanced Wireless Group and many others to offer Wi-Fi. Because Google's partners don't have a presence in all U.S. airports Google's free Wi-Fi won't cover everybody traveling this season. \n \n Google's move follows a similar free Wi-Fi offer from Yahoo. On Tuesday, Yahoo announced that it would provide free Wi-Fi for an entire year in New York's Times Square. \n \n Here is breakdown of how Google's free Wi-Fi offer works: \n \n Get Online For Free \n \n Airports across the country offering Google's free Wi-Fi include Boston's Logan Airport, Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport, Las Vegas' McCarran International, Seattle's SeaTac and many others. But there are some notable absences from Google's free Wi-Fi list including major hubs and popular destinations like Chicago O'Hare, LAX in Los Angeles, Minneapolis-St.Paul, Dallas-Fort Worth and all three New York-area airports. On the upside, however, Google says that Seattle and Burbank airports intend to offer free Wi-Fi for an indefinite period as a result of this free Wi-Fi program. \n \n Contests and the Spirit of Giving \n \n Starting next Monday, you will be able to win prizes by submitting photos of yourself using free in-flight or airport Wi-Fi during the holidays. Google doesn't specify what the prizes are or what constitutes a winning photo, but it looks like you'll be submitting photos to Picasa, Google's online photo storage and sharing service. To get more details about the photo contest, you have to enter your e-mail to Google's Holiday Wi-Fi Photo Contest page. \n \n Image Credit: Flickr user mastermaqGoogle is also encouraging free Wi-Fi users to open their hearts and their wallets this year. When you log on to free Wi-Fi from any of the participating hotspots this season, you will be given the option to give back by donating to your choice of three different charities via Google Checkout. Charities include Climate Savers Computing, One Economy Corporation and Engineers Without Borders USA. Google says it will match donations across all the free Wi-Fi hotspots up to $250,000, and the airport that generates the most donations by January 1, 2010 will receive $15,000 to donate to the charity of their choice. Check out Google's charity page for more information. \n \n The Fine Print \n \n Taking a closer look at Google's offer there doesn't seem to be much in the way of sneaky catches--unless you consider a request for donations a catch. Google says you will not need to enter any credit card or other payment information to get the free Wi-Fi, but if you usually buy day passes to Wi-Fi services like Boingo watch out when selecting a network. Among your available wireless networks will be paid hotspots and Google's complimentary Wi-Fi, so make sure you choose the free service and save yourself a few dollars. One other thing Google doesn't address in its announcement is whether its gift of free Wi-Fi will be ad supported or not. \n \n You should also know that Google says it \"will have access to some aggregate, non-personally identifiable information.\" This should not come as a surprise to regular Google users, but if you're squeamish about Google and its data practices then free Wi-Fi may not be the gift for you this year. \n \n For more information check out Google's free Wi-Fi FAQ page. \n \n Connect with Ian Paul on Twitter (@ianpaul).",

(Associated Press) \n \n File-This Feb. 28, 2014, file photo shows Samantha Power, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., speaking during a news conference after a private U.N. Security Council meeting. Power is going to visit all three... (Associated Press) \n \n Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that as a physician and scientist, he would have recommended against a quarantine. \n \n \"The best way to protect us is to stop the epidemic in Africa, and we need those health care workers so we do not want to put them in a position where it makes it very, very uncomfortable for them to even volunteer to go.\" he said. \n \n He said active and direct monitoring can accomplish the same thing as a quarantine because people infected with Ebola do not become contagious until they start showing symptoms. Ebola is transmitted through direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person. \n \n New York, New Jersey and Illinois imposed mandatory quarantines after Dr. Craig Spencer, a Doctors Without Borders physician who treated patients in Guinea, was diagnosed with Ebola last Thursday.

    "document": "Commissioner Manfred's full decision on Pete Rose's reinstatement bid \n \n \"I, therefore, must reject Mr. Rose's application for reinstatement.\" \n \n The all-time hits leader, 74, was placed on the permanently ineligible list for violating Major League Baseball's strict rule against betting on baseball on Aug. 23, 1989. Subsequently, the Board of Directors of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum declared that all players on that list would also be ineligible for election. \n \n Manfred's decision, which was communicated to Rose both verbally and in writing, does not directly address that issue. \n \n Gammons on Rose's ban Gammons on Rose's ban on MLB Tonight Peter Gammons joins MLB Tonight to discuss the implication of Pete Rose's permanent ban and the history of the case \n \n He wrote: \"It is not part of my authority of responsibility here to make any determination concerning Mr. Rose's eligibility as a candidate for election to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. In fact, in my view, the considerations that should drive a decision on whether an individual should be allowed to work in Baseball are not the same as those that should drive a decision on Hall of Fame eligibility. \u2026 Thus, any debate over Mr. Rose's eligibility for the Hall of Fame is one that must take place in a different forum.\" \n \n \u2022 Justice: No other choice but to maintain Rose's ban \n \n The National Baseball Hall of Fame later addressed the situation in a statement: \"Pete Rose remains ineligible for Hall of Fame consideration, based on the Hall of Fame's bylaws, which preclude any individual on baseball's ineligible list from being considered a candidate for election.\" \n \n \u2022 Manfred: Rose's Hall eligibility a separate issue \n \n Rose formally exercised his right to appeal his case on April 1, 2015. Manfred first requested a \"comprehensive review\" of the issues from his staff and then spoke to him in person on Sept. 24. \n \n The three-page decision both reiterated the importance of Rule 21 and made it clear Manfred does not think that Rose has \"reconfigured\" his life as former Commissioner Bart Giamatti urged him to do in 1989. \n \n \"I believe that, at a minimum, there must be objective evidence which demonstrates that the applicant has fundamentally changed his life and that, based on such changes, the applicant does not pose a risk for violating Rule 21 in the future,\" Manfred wrote. \n \n \"What has been presented to me for consideration falls well short of these requirements. It is not at all clear to me that Mr. Rose has a grasp of the scope of his violations of Rule 21. He claims not to remember significant misconduct detailed in the Dowd Report and corroborated by Michael Bertolini's betting notebook.\" \n \n The latter is a reference to the notebook of a Rose associate that the Commissioner's Office obtained after the publication of an ESPN report on June 23, 2015, which appeared to show that he had bet on the Reds as an active player in 1985 and 1986. Rose has admitted only to wagering on the team after becoming the manager. \n \n \"He made assertions concerning his betting habits that were directly contradicted by documentary evidence. \u2026 And, significantly, he told me that currently he bets recreationally and legally on horses and sports, including Baseball,\" Manfred wrote. \n \n In a footnote, the decision adds: \"Even more troubling, in our interview, Rose initially denied betting on Baseball currently and only later in the interview did he 'clarify' his response to admit such betting.\" \n \n The decision also disputes Rose's contention that he bet on the Reds to win every game. While noting that how often he wagered and which team he put his money on doesn't matter regarding the violation of Rule 21, it points out that his decision to pass on certain games may have been a tip-off to those who were aware of his activity. \n \n Verducci on Rose's ban Verducci on Rose's permanent ban MLB Network insider Tom Verducci talks about Commissioner Manfred not lifting Pete Rose's permanent ban for gambling on baseball \n \n Continued Manfred: \"Mr. Rose's public and private comments \u2026 provide me with little confidence that he has a mature understanding of his wrongful conduct, that he has accepted full responsibility for it, or that he understands the damage he has caused. \u2026 I am also not convinced that he has avoided the type of conduct and associations that originally led to his placement on the permanently ineligible list.\" \n \n Rose may not associate with any Major or Minor League club. These rules, however, do not cover relationships with third parties that do business with MLB. So he may pursue such opportunities unless it involves an association with a Major League club, in which case the proposal must be submitted to the Commissioner's Office for review. \n \n Manfred did acknowledge that Rose had an exceptional career. \n \n \"Notwithstanding this conclusion, I respect Mr. Rose's accomplishments as a player and, as result, I will continue to allow him to participate in ceremonial activities that present no threat to the integrity of the game, provided that the activities are approved by me in advance,\" he wrote. \n \n In a statement, Reds president and chief executive officer Bob Castellini said, \"The Commissioner called me this morning prior to the announcement. We respect his decision on the matter of Pete Rose and are grateful for his diligence and the amount of time he spent on the matter. We also appreciate that the Commissioner stated that Hall of Fame consideration is a separate issue and we and the fans think he deserves that opportunity. We are pleased that we have had and will continue to have opportunities to commemorate Pete's remarkable on-field accomplishments. Any future plans to celebrate Pete's career with the Reds first will be discussed with the Commissioner and then will be communicated publicly at the appropriate time.\" ||||| Newly uncovered documents obtained by Outside the Lines provide the first written record that Pete Rose bet extensively on baseball, and on the Reds, while he was still a player. (5:26) \n \n For 26 years, Pete Rose has kept to one story: He never bet on baseball while he was a player. \n \n Yes, he admitted in 2004, after almost 15 years of denials, he had placed bets on baseball, but he insisted it was only as a manager. \n \n ON OUTSIDE THE LINES TODAY T.J. Quinn reports on the notebook that shows Pete Rose bet on baseball as a player, at 2:30 p.m. ET Monday on ESPN. \n \n But new documents obtained by Outside the Lines indicate Rose bet extensively on baseball -- and on the Cincinnati Reds -- as he racked up the last hits of a record-smashing career in 1986. The documents go beyond the evidence presented in the 1989 Dowd report that led to Rose's banishment and provide the first written record that Rose bet while he was still on the field. \n \n \"This does it. This closes the door,\" said John Dowd, the former federal prosecutor who led MLB's investigation. \n \n Editor's Picks Stark: Pete Rose still belongs in Hall of Fame The Hall of Fame should tell the true story of baseball: the good, the bad, the ugly, the beautiful, the inspiring, the embarrassing. Let Pete Rose in. \n \n The documents are copies of pages from a notebook seized from the home of former Rose associate Michael Bertolini during a raid by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service in October 1989, nearly two months after Rose was declared permanently ineligible by Major League Baseball. Their authenticity has been verified by two people who took part in the raid, which was part of a mail fraud investigation and unrelated to gambling. For 26 years, the notebook has remained under court-ordered seal and is currently stored in the National Archives' New York office, where officials have declined requests to release it publicly. \n \n Rose, through his lawyer, Raymond Genco, issued a statement: \"Since we submitted the application earlier this year, we committed to MLB that we would not comment on specific matters relating to reinstatement. I need to maintain that. To be sure, I'm eager to sit down with [MLB commissioner Rob] Manfred to address my entire history -- the good and the bad -- and my long personal journey since baseball. That meeting likely will come sometime after the All-Star break. Therefore at this point, it's not appropriate to comment on any specifics.\" Bertolini's lawyer, Nicholas De Feis, said his client is \"not interested in speaking to anyone about these issues.\" \n \n ESPN \n \n Dowd, who reviewed the documents at Outside the Lines' request, said his investigators had tried but failed to obtain Bertolini's records, believing they would be the final piece in their case that Rose was betting with mob-connected bookmakers in New York. Dowd and his team had sworn testimony from bookie Ron Peters that Rose bet on the Reds from 1984 through 1986, but not written documentation. Dowd also had testimony and a recorded phone conversation between Bertolini and another Rose associate, Paul Janszen, that established that Bertolini had placed bets for Rose. But Dowd never had the kind of documents that could cement that part of his case, especially in the eyes of fans who wanted to see Rose returned to Major League Baseball. \n \n \"We knew that [Bertolini] recorded the bets, and that he bet himself, but we never had his records. We tried to get them. He refused to give them to us,\" Dowd said. \"This is the final piece of the puzzle on a New York betting operation with organized crime. And, of course, [Rose] betting while he was a player.\" \n \n The documents obtained by Outside the Lines, which reflect betting records from March through July 1986, show no evidence that Rose, who was a player-manager in 1986, bet against his team. They provide a vivid snapshot of how extensive Rose's betting life was in 1986: \n \n \u2022 In the time covered in the notebook, from March through July, Rose bet on at least one MLB team on 30 different days. It's impossible to count the exact number of times he bet on baseball games because not every day's entries are legible. \n \n \u2022 But on 21 of the days it's clear he bet on baseball, he gambled on the Reds, including on games in which he played. \n \n \u2022 Most bets, regardless of sport, were about $2,000. The largest single bet was $5,500 on the Boston Celtics, a bet he lost. \n \n \u2022 Rose bet heavily on college and professional basketball, losing $15,400 on one day in March. That came during his worst week of the four-month span, when he lost $25,500. \n \n Dowd said he wished he'd had the Bertolini notebook in 1989, but he didn't need it to justify Rose's banishment. Under MLB Rule 21, \"Any player, umpire, or club or league official or employee, who shall bet any sum whatsoever upon any baseball game in connection with which the bettor has a duty to perform shall be declared permanently ineligible.\" \n \n But Rose's supporters have based part of their case for his reinstatement on his claim that he never bet while he was a player or against his team, saying that sins he committed as a manager shouldn't diminish what he did as a player. \n \n \"The rule says, if you bet, it doesn't say for or against. It's another device by Pete to try to excuse what he did,\" Dowd said. \"But when he bet, he was gone. He placed his financial interest ahead of the Reds, period.\" \n \n The timing for Rose, who played in 72 games in 1986, isn't great. In March of this year, he applied to Manfred for reinstatement. Dowd recently met with MLB CIO and executive vice president of administration John McHale Jr., who is leading Manfred's review of Rose's reinstatement request, to walk McHale through his investigation. On Monday morning, MLB officials declined to comment about the notebook. \n \n In April, Rose repeated his denial, this time on Michael Kay's ESPN New York 98.7 FM radio show, that he bet on baseball while he was a player. \"Never bet as a player: That's a fact,\" he said. \n \n Outside the Lines tracked down two of the postal inspectors who conducted the raid on Bertolini's home in 1989 and asked them to review the documents. Both agents, former supervisor Craig Barney and former inspector Mary Flynn, said the records were indeed copies of the notebook they seized. \n \n When the case began, it didn't look particularly enticing, Barney said. The postal inspector's office in Brooklyn, New York, had received a complaint that a man in Staten Island had failed to return goods to paying customers that he was supposed to have autographed. The man's name was Michael Bertolini, and the business he ran out of his home was called Hit King Marketing Inc. \n \n ESPN \n \n \"It was a mere 'failure to render [services]' complaint,\" said Barney, who is now retired. \"We didn't know anything about Bertolini or his connection [to Rose].\" \n \n If the accusation was true, it would constitute mail fraud, but the agents had no probable cause to search Bertolini's house. \n \n Barney sent an agent to drive by the address. There was a for sale sign out front, the agent told him. So Barney and Flynn, posing as a couple looking for a home, called a real estate agent and were given a guided tour of Bertolini's house. \"It was such a mess. There was stuff everywhere,\" Barney said. \n \n Bats, balls, books and papers were scattered all over. It looked to them as if Bertolini had been signing memorabilia with the forged names of some of the most famous baseball players in history: Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, Duke Snider, Mike Schmidt and Pete Rose. \"It reeked of fraud,\" Barney said. \n \n The two inspectors spotted an item that a complainant said had not been returned. That gave them probable cause to seek a search warrant. \n \n On Oct. 13, a few days after the undercover house tour and after obtaining a search warrant, they searched Bertolini's home and found evidence that would lead to numerous convictions. But one item stood out: In a box of papers in the basement, Barney said, was a spiral notebook filled with handwritten entries. \n \n It was immediately clear that the many notations of \"PETE\" in the pages represented Pete Rose. \n \n \"There were numbers and dates and -- it was a book for sports betting,\" Barney said. \"I was taken aback.\" \n \n Flynn, who said her first reaction was \"Holy mackerel,\" said they asked Bertolini about the notebook. \n \n \"He wasn't forthcoming with much information,\" she said, \"but he did acknowledge to me it was records of bets he made for Pete Rose.\" \n \n Bertolini offered his take on the raid during his sentencing hearing in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn six years later (he served 14 months for tax fraud and a concurrent assault sentence): \n \n \"I got a call at the place where I was working at the time from my brother, and he says, 'You should come home.' He said, 'There's a bunch of government people here, and they're here for you.' At the time, I think it was Mary Flynn of the postal inspector's office who got on the phone and said, 'We're here,' and she told me why and so forth. They took any records I had whatsoever, and they took different personal belongings and memorabilia from my home.\" \n \n Postal inspectors seized memorabilia from Michael Bertolini's house that contained the names of some of the most famous baseball players in history: Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, Duke Snider, Mike Schmidt and Pete Rose. William Weinbaum/ESPN \n \n Although the 1989 raid on Bertolini's house received immediate news coverage, nothing about a betting book became public for five years. After Bertolini pleaded guilty and received a federal prison sentence, Sports Illustrated, The New York Times, ESPN and other news organizations filed freedom of information requests with the U.S. Attorney's Office seeking access to the book. All were denied on the grounds that the notebook had been introduced as a grand jury exhibit and contained information \"concerning third parties who were not of investigative interest.\" \n \n Last year, Outside the Lines again applied unsuccessfully for access to the notebook but learned it had been transferred to the National Archives under a civil action titled \"United States v. One Executive Tools Spiral Notebook.\" Two small boxes of other items confiscated in the postal raid on Bertolini's house went too, including autographed baseballs and baseball cards. \n \n In April, Outside the Lines examined the Bertolini memorabilia kept in the National Archives' New York office, but the betting book -- held apart from everything else -- was off-limits. The U.S. Attorney's Office internal memorandum from 2000 that requested the spiral notebook's transfer said Bertolini's closed file has \"sufficient historical or other value to warrant its continued preservation by the United States Government.\" The memorandum listed among its attachments a copy of the notebook, but a copy of the memorandum provided by the National Archives had no attachments and had a section redacted. \n \n \"I wish I had been able to use it [the book] all those years he was denying he bet on baseball,\" said Flynn, the former postal inspector. \"He's a liar.\" \n \n To Dowd, one of the most compelling elements of the newly uncovered evidence is that it supports the charge that Rose was betting with mob-connected bookies through Bertolini. Dowd's investigation had established that Rose was hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt at the time he was banished from the game. \n \n \"Bertolini nails down the connection to organized crime on Long Island and New York. And that is a very powerful problem,\" Dowd said. \"[Ohio bookie] Ron Peters is a golf pro, so he's got other occupations. But the boys in New York are about breaking arms and knees. \n \n \"The implications for baseball are terrible. [The mob] had a mortgage on Pete while he was a player and manager.\" \n \n Freelance researcher Liam Quinn contributed to this report.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The MLB player with the most hits in the league's history should be a shoo-in for the Hall of Fame, but that's hard to do when you've been permanently banned from baseball\u2014again. Commissioner Rob Manfred was reportedly set to tell Pete Rose on Thursday he won't lift the permanent ban against Rose that's been in place since 1989, but queries by the New York Times appeared to expedite Manfred's announcement, which he made Monday instead. MLB.com notes Manfred informed Rose, both verbally and in writing, of his decision. The \"stark language\" of the league's rules dictates \"that the penalty for a player or manager who bets on a game in which he has a duty to perform is mandatory, permanent ineligibility,\" Manfred says in his announcement accompanying the MLB press release. He adds he had instructed staff to gather any new evidence that may have emerged since the 1989 Dowd Report that helped place Rose on the league's ineligible list, based on evidence Rose bet on baseball while managing the Cincinnati Reds\u2014including bets on his own team. In addition to a polygraph test and a private meeting between Rose and Manfred in September, that new evidence included an incriminating notebook revealed in a June ESPN report that indicates Rose also bet while still playing for the Reds. Manfred notes that during that conversation, Rose had inconsistent stories, made contradictory statements, and couldn't remember important facts from the Dowd document. Another nugget came to light during Manfred and Rose's meeting that appears to have influenced the decision. \"Significantly, [Rose] told me that currently he bets recreationally and legally on horses and sports, including Baseball,\" Manfred notes.

    "document": "BEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 The Syrian military shelled rebel targets in urban enclaves on Thursday as it readied assault troops and armored columns for a possible invasion of Aleppo, Syria \u2019s densely populated commercial capital, where insurgents have embedded themselves over the past week in preparation for a battle. \n \n Antigovernment activists reached by phone and Skype in Aleppo said that the city\u2019s civilian population was gripped by foreboding as government forces massed on the southern outskirts, and that fierce street clashes had sporadically erupted. But Syrian military commanders appeared to be awaiting reinforcements before issuing invasion orders. \n \n Military experts have long speculated that President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s army, which has been scrambling to crush rebel resistance in urban areas like Homs, Hama and more recently central and southern neighborhoods of Damascus during the uprising, lacked the military resources to take on an armed rebellion in all major cities at once. That seemed to explain the delay in Aleppo, where anticipation of an attack has been building for days. \n \n The United States expressed alarm about the possibility of mass civilian casualties in Aleppo, a Unesco World Heritage site and one of the Middle East\u2019s most storied cities. Victoria Nuland, a State Department spokeswoman, told reporters in Washington that there was \u201cconcern that we will see a massacre in Aleppo, and that\u2019s what the regime appears to be lining up for.\u201d \n \n But Ms. Nuland also indicated that the United States was not reconsidering its stance against military intervention, saying, \u201cWe do not think pouring more fuel onto the fire is going to save lives.\u201d And she drew a sharp distinction between Aleppo and the Libyan city of Benghazi, where fears of a slaughter by government troops led to a NATO bombing campaign that proved decisive in toppling Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi last year. \n \n \u201cThe kind of groundswell call for external support that we\u2019ve seen elsewhere is not there,\u201d Ms. Nuland said. \n \n A resident in the city named Ahmed, reached by Skype on Thursday afternoon, said Aleppo was convulsed with rumors that the army\u2019s elite Fourth Division, commanded by Mr. Assad\u2019s brother Maher, was mobilizing for an attack. \u201cWe are terrified,\u201d he said. \n \n Antigovernment fighters \u2014 including foreign fighters \u2014 were arriving or were preparing to travel to Aleppo from surrounding areas, activists said. Although the insurgents claimed to have destroyed police stations in two of the city\u2019s neighborhoods, they were repulsed when they tried to take over two others, said Majed Abdel Nour, a spokesman in the city for the Shaam News Network, an antigovernment activist group. \n \n The possibility of a major battle for Aleppo came as Turkey\u2019s prime minister injected a new element of tension into the Syrian conflict, asserting that Syrian forces had abandoned territories close to the Turkish border that had since been occupied by Kurdish militants hostile to Turkey. \n \n In recent weeks, activists from Kurdish hamlets near the Turkish border have posted videos of celebrations there, including in Kobani, where residents were seen raising the Kurdish flag. \n \n The Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, told reporters in Turkey that his country\u2019s armed forces would \u201ctake whatever steps are necessary against terrorism\u201d in these areas, foreshadowing possible Turkish military incursions into Syria, similar to Turkey\u2019s incursions into areas of northern Iraq where Kurdish militants have sought sanctuary. \n \n Mr. Erdogan\u2019s warning came a day after Turkey placed new restrictions on Syrian-Turkish commercial trade along the 550-mile border, barring Turkish vehicles from entering Syria after clashes inside Syria in which many were damaged. The Turkish restrictions do not prohibit Syrian merchants from entering Turkey or place any limits on refugees. \n \n Most of the clashes that have paralyzed Aleppo in recent days have taken place in the poorer, eastern parts, where a host of informal neighborhoods have sprung up in recent years. Populated mainly by Sunni Muslims arriving from rural areas, residents are sympathetic to the fighters, offering them meals to break the Ramadan fast and other support. There have also been clashes near the city\u2019s historic center. \n \n But with shelling during the night, residents took advantage of daylight to try to flee. Government helicopters continued to patrol Aleppo, firing occasionally, activists said. \n \n The official Syrian news agency reported Thursday that clashes between the army and armed groups had \u201cresulted in the killing and wounding of many terrorists.\u201d \n \n Mohamed, a resident from the eastern part of Aleppo, said the army was randomly shelling the city and beefing up its presence at checkpoints. Dozens of civilians had been killed in the past two days, he said. \n \n \u201cThis used to be a restless city,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s the opposite.\u201d He added that there were no police officers on the streets, no fuel available and no bread. \n \n Abu Qusay, a field activist and fighter from nearby Idlib Province, said that he and dozens of other fighters, including Libyans, were preparing to travel on farm roads toward Aleppo. The fighters were bringing some light weapons, and counting on finding more in stockpiles seized by the rebels inside the city, he said. \n \n In Damascus, activists reported scores of deaths, including among civilians, during heavy fighting in southern suburbs, the scene of clashes over the last two weeks. \n \n There were also reports of deadly clashes between rebel fighters and the army in Tall Shihab, a town that hugs Syria\u2019s border with Jordan and that sits along a route used by refugees trying to escape Syria. \n \n At a news conference in Damascus on Thursday, Herv\u00e9 Ladsous, the United Nations under secretary general in charge of peacekeeping operations globally, elaborated on a decision announced Wednesday to send back roughly half of the 300 monitors whose work has been suspended in Syria since mid-June because of the violence. \n \n \u201cWe found ourselves with too many people with not enough to do,\u201d Mr. Ladsous said. \n \n Nonetheless, Mr. Ladsous offered assurances that the monitoring mission was still functioning, even though its mandate, which expired last Friday, was only renewed for a further 30 days by the United Nations Security Council. \u201cThe U.N. is in no way packing and going,\u201d he said. \n \n Neil MacFarquhar reported from Beirut, and Rick Gladstone from New York.

Ian Black, the Guardian's Middle East editor, says some bitter internal debate is likely. \n \n A statement from the Avaaz organisation regarding the situation in Yarmouk: \n \n Activists from Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp in Damascus reported that at least five civilians were killed and 25 injured after regime forces attacked the camp with tanks and helicopter gunships this morning. Activist Muhammad told Avaaz: \"The regime forces shelled the neighbourhoods of Orouba and Thalathin, and stormed into the camp with tanks and military vehicles. Deir Yassine clinics were also hit in the shelling.\" Snipers were positioned rooftops and were taking pot-shots at \"anyone moving in the street\" according to another resident. Security forces stormed into the Palestinian ICRC hospital, dragging away at least 10 wounded civilians. Activists confirmed that FSA groups are in the neighbourhoods of Tadamon and Hajar al Aswad next to Yarmouk camp, but not inside the camp itself, due to an agreement to keep it as a safe area for displaced civilians. Palestinian families the camp are hosting around 20,000 displaced people \u2013 either in their houses or in makeshift shelters inside schools. They are mainly residents who fled the neighbourhoods of Midan and Tadamon and the city of Douma in Damascus suburbs. \n \n Time Magazine is claiming the first-ever interview with a member of Jabhat al-Nusra, the shadowy group that is alleged to have carried out suicide bombings in Syria (though some have disputed its existence). \n \n It took weeks of negotiations to secure an interview with a member of the movement, the first time anyone from the group has talked to the media. Higher-ups in the Jabhat declined to be interviewed but agreed to let Ibrahim, a 21-year-old Syrian, be interviewed. The Jabhat has a presence in at least half a dozen towns in Idlib province, as well as elsewhere across the country, including strong showings in the capital Damascus and in Hama, according to the Jabhat member and other Islamists who are in contact with senior members of the group. Bespectacled, with a wispy beard and thin moustache, Ibrahim said he joined the group eight months ago. He was recruited by his cousin Ammar, the military operations commander for their unit and a Syrian veteran of the Iraq war who fought alongside his Sunni co-religionists against the American invaders. \n \n Luke Harding, who is in a rural area near Aleppo, relays FSA claims about shelling in the Salaheddin area in the south of the city. \n \n Didn't manage to reach #Aleppo today.

One claimed that Ladsous was deliberately \"misinterpreting\" a resolution to extend the mission for 30 days. \n \n \u2022 Arms control campaigners claim a first draft of a UN global arms trade treaty is meaningless as it would not stop weapons shipments from Russia to Syria. \n \n \u2022 The rebel-held town of Azaz (or Izzaz) north of Aleppo is ruins about after weeks of fighting, Reuters reports. \n \n More bluster from the Turkish prime Recep Tayyip Erdogan, or does he know something we don't? \n \n AP quotes him saying that Bashar al-Assad and those close to him are about to leave power and preparations are underway for a \"new era\" in Syria. \n \n We're wondering what has happened to Sana, the Syrian government's news agency. Its website has been down for the last two days. \n \n Sana has gone offline several times recently, but never for such a long period. Possibly it has come under a cyber attack, but usually someone claims responsibility for such attacks \u2013 and we're not aware of any claims. \n \n In theory, a cyber attack should not prevent Sana from using Twitter but there have been no tweets from its English-language Twitter account (@SANA_English) since Tuesday morning \u2013 which is very unusual. \n \n Activists have smashed framed photographs of president Assad looted from a police station in Aleppo, according to new video footage. \n \n The police building is in the Karm al-Qaterji district of the city, east of the centre according to Twitter user @markito0171 who has been mapping the location of activists videos for months. \n \n The government's counter offensive against Aleppo is due to start on Friday or Saturday, AFP reports citing a security source. \n \n It said that thousands of troops and opposition forces had been dispatched to the city. \n \n It quoted Free Syrian Army colonel, Abdul Gabbar Kaida, as saying: \n \n The army's reinforcements have arrived in Aleppo. We expect a major offensive at any time, specifically on areas across the southern belt, from east to west. \n \n Kaida, who is directing the rebel forces in Aleppo, also claimed that 100 army tanks \u2014 as well as a large number of military vehicles \u2014 had arrived in Aleppo. \n \n Yesterday Kaida told the Guardian's Luke Harding that the rebels controlled half of Aleppo. \n \n The Syrian foreign ministry is playing down the defection of two of its diplomats \u2013 Abdulatif al-Dabbagh, the ambassador in the UAE, and his wife, Lamia Hariri, (both pictured) who was Syria's envoy in Cyprus. \n \n The website of Syria's state news has been mysteriously out of action for most of this week, so for now we have to turn to the Chinese Xinhua agency for the Syrian government's line. \n \n It reports: \n \n Syrian foreign ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi told Xinhua that Dabbagh arrived in Syria on June 4 for consultation upon the request of the ministry, adding that the embassy in UAE \" since then was run by charge d'affairs and now we notified the UAE that he is no longer an ambassador.\" The ministry, meanwhile, made clear that Hariri is not ambassador, but a diplomat that has been running the Syrian embassy in Cyprus till an ambassador is appointed. \n \n Earlier this month, following the defection of Nawaf al-Fares, the Syrian ambassador in Baghdad, the foreign ministry said he had been dismissed for leaving the embassy without official authorisation. \n \n Russia said its flotilla of 10 battleships currently in the eastern Mediterranean will not dock at Tartus, its naval port in Syria. \n \n RIA Novosti quotes naval chief vice admiral Viktor Chirkov as saying: \"The joint fleet flotilla will not enter the port of Tartus. It is carrying out military drills in the Mediterranean.\" \n \n Other sources have confirmed Mahmoud Nassar's account of the attack on Hajar Aswad. \n \n The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has this: \n \n The Hajar al-Aswad neighbourhood is being bombarded by regime forces, who have surrounded the neighbourhood from several entrances; helicopters are being used in the attack. \n \n Activists have posted video of smouldering cars and a building purporting to show the nearby Yarmouk Palestinian camp. \n \n Dania, a Damascus activist, tweeted: \n \n You can listen to audio of Hajar Mahmoud Nassar describing what he witnessed during the government's assault on Hajr Aswad today. \n \n Read the previous post for the full report. At the end of the clip Nasar says: \"I don't know if this day will end normal and safe ... they shoot everything.\" \n \n Rebel forces in Damascus have retreated to the southern district of Hajar Aswad where they have been under attack for the last six hours, an witness told the Guardian. \n \n Mahmoud Nassar, a citizen journalist from the area, said it has been under tank and helicopter bombardment. \n \n \"They [the Free Syrian Army] have withdrawn to Hajar Aswad and the areas around Hajar Aswad,\" he said. \n \n The government's attack against the area is part of a counter offensive to retake the city. The government has retaken the Midan district and the nearby al-Qadam district. But there continue to be clashes across the whole of south of the city, according to to Nassar. \n \n I saw them since six hours trying to go up a street - we are talking about 500m. They didn't succeed to bust those 500m because there's strong resistance from Hajar Aswad. So they are trying to go from the side of Hajar Aswad - from Yarmouk and al-Qadam. \n \n \n \n View Damascus in a larger map \n \n This Google map shows the areas he mentioned.Nassar said he saw a tank shell kill a man working on the tyres of a car. He also mentioned another man who was shot by a sniper while shopping for bread. \n \n Nassar claimed that government forces were using heavy machine guns to attack an area that included a Palestinian hospital. \"I saw the civilians trying to escape,\" he said. The security forces occupy the territory around the hospital in the area, he said. \n \n Nassar saw helicopter firing machine guns and rockets at an area to the south of Hajar Aswad that includes a military base. \"There are no aircraft just helicopters - two helicopters,\" he said. \n \n The Free Syrian Army withdrew its forces from Damascus after the government began using helicopters against civilian areas, he claimed. Rebels don't have \"smart weapons\" to combat helicopters, he said. \n \n I think it will be a long day in Yarmouk and Hajar Aswad. I'm about a 1km away and I can hear shots. \n \n The Free Syrian Army is trying to attack tanks right now\" he said, but added they could not fire because of Palestinian civilians in the area. \n \n He suggested that the rebels were trying to create a safe haven in the Yarmouk camp. Most of the Palestinians in the camp supported the rebels, he claimed. \n \n Brigadier General Manaf Tlass, the cigar-chomping defector backed by US officials (see 9.47am) seems to have thrown his lot in with the Saudis rather than the Qataris \u2013 unlike many of the other Syrian defectors. \n \n He's featured today in an interview (in Arabic) with the Saudi-owned Asharq al-Awsat where he thanks King Abdullah \"for giving me this opportunity to visit Saudi Arabia\" and describes the kingdom as \"a friendly country to Syria\". \n \n He also confirms \u2013 as we suggested in the live blog yesterday \u2013 that he has been in Saudi Arabia performing the umrah pilgrimage. This helps to explain the period of silence following his defection. \n \n In extracts from the interview translated by Reuters, Tlass says: \n \n I am discussing with ... people outside Syria to reach a consensus with those inside. I left (Syria) ... to try to help the best I can to unite the honourable people inside and outside Syria to set out a road map to get Syria out of this crisis. I realise this is a difficult phase ... It's difficult for one person to bear the responsibility of such a phase. A group (including opposition) from inside and outside Syria should cooperate to accomplish this phase. \n \n He adds that he \"did not leave Syria to lead the transitional period\". \n \n Following the Qubair massacre last month, the Syrian government appointed its own commission to investigate, but it wasn't long before reports started circulating that the head of the commission, Talal Houshan, had defected. \n \n These reports now appear to be confirmed by a video posted on YouTube where Houshan, apparently reading a prepared statement, accuses the Syrian government and its shabiha supporters of killing women and children. \n \n In the statement, he refers to numerous \"crimes\" by the regime and cites eyewitnesses. \n \n Many Kurdish towns in the northeast of Syria are now flying the Kurdish flag as Syrian troops have withdrawn from the region to fight back the offensives in Syria's two largest cities, Syria-watcher Joshua Landis writes on his blog. \n \n Landis quotes a friend in Iraqi Kurdistan who says the Kurds' takeover of towns in Syria has \"led to a crisis of relations between them and the FSA/rebels\". \n \n Supposedly, some months back there had been a pledge of mutual support between the Kurds and the rebels, regarding resistance against the regime. Now however, the Kurds seem more interested in protecting their homeland than in participating in the nation-wide struggle against the regime. After taking control of Hasake (haven't verified this), a conflict emerged between them and the FSA that wanted to control the area due to its strategic importance. \n \n Landis also points to an article in The National by Aymenn al-Tamimi which begins: \n \n Developments in Syria and Iraq have led some to speculate that the birth of an independent Kurdish state might be at hand. A closer analysis shows that a united Kurdistan is still unlikely, although a separate semi-autonomous Kurdish community in Syria, with some parallels to the Kurdish Autonomous Region in Iraq, is a growing possibility. \n \n Blogger Brown Moses has highlighted another video of a warplane flying over Aleppo. \n \n The outline of the aircraft in the video \u2013 much clearer than in previous clips \u2013 shows that it is not a MiG fighter, contrary to what various news organisations are reporting. \n \n The Wall Street Journal \u2013 which seems to think it's America's job to choose a replacement for Bashar al-Assad \u2013 says US officials have latched on to the cigar-chomping Manaf Tlass as a likely prospect. \n \n Tlass, who defected recently, is \"one of the few figures in opposition to the regime who could potentially help restore order in Damascus and secure Syria's vast chemical-weapons stockpile\", Eric Linton writes citing unnamed officials. \n \n Tlass was a commander in Syria's elite Republican Guard before his July 6 defection, and his father served as defense minister under Assad's late father, President Hafez al-Assad, for 30 years. He is also, unlike the Assad clan, a Sunni Muslim, which western officials hope could make him acceptable as a transitional figure to the country's rebel fighters and opposition leaders, who are also largely from the Sunni sect of Islam. \n \n But the article doesn't find many others who agree. It acknowledges that \"many in the opposition consider Tlass and his family too closely tied to the Assads' repression and corruption to be acceptable to Syrians\". \n \n It quotes a US defence official as saying \"It's too early to say if Tlass will stand the strain and pick up traction or just fade away\", while exiled Syrian activist Ammar Abdulhamid says: \n \n Someone like Tlass is difficult to sell to the Syrian people. He certainly can't play any leading role in a transition. \n \n In an article posted on the Jadaliyya website, Bassam Haddad describes some scary meetings with Manaf Tlass while researching the development of capitalism in Syria (and the related corruption). \n \n On reform, he asserted the importance of gradualism, a Hafez al-Asad mantra, one that suits the reformers' timetable, not that of the purported beneficiaries. But he was also unabashed in asserting the need for top-down control, which to him transcended questions of right and wrong, or democracy and authoritarianism. The regime had to guide the reform process based on a holistic view, one that takes into account local and regional variables. I interjected that this approach is the norm for regimes like Syria's because reform is not the goal. He did not correct me, and reasserted the need for control. \n \n Almost unnoticed last week, as attention focused on battles in Damascus, Kurdish activists in north-eastern Syria started taking control of a few towns without encountering much resistance from the Assad regime's security forces. \n \n In an article for Comment is free, Fazel Hawramy (aka Kurdishblogger) says this is a significant development which could potentially tilt the balance of power against Assad. Kurdish relations with the opposition Syrian National Council (SNC) are still problematic, though: \n \n In April, the SNC issued a National Charter to \"redress the injustice \u2026 the Kurdish people have faced for decades \u2026\" and work towards \"the abolition of all discriminatory policies \u2026 and compensate those affected.\" While this is an important starting point, the Kurds \u2013 who have faced years of discrimination at the hands of successive \"Arab\" regimes in Syria \u2013 find it difficult to trust a guarantee by the SNC, which is dominated by Arab nationalists and members of Muslim Brotherhood movement. The Kurdish parties believe the charter falls short of full constitutional recognition. The insistence of SNC members to retain the word \"Arab\" in the official name of the country \u2013 the \"Syrian Arab Republic\" \u2013 has been one of the main stumbling blocks for the Kurds to trust the SNC as their legitimate voice in a post-Assad Syria. \n \n (all times BST) Welcome to Middle East Live. \n \n Here's a roundup of the latest developments and analysis on Syria: \n \n \u2022 All the signs indicate that a battle is looming in Aleppo, the New York Times reports. \n \n After withdrawing all visible security forces, for a day, Syrian Army troops brought in on trucks or buses suddenly deployed around the 13th-century citadel. Thousands more were en route, according to rebel fighters and activists. \"People know there is going to be chaos, fighting, shelling, so people are frightened,\" said one activist reached via Skype. \"They have stocked up on canned goods and are not venturing out.\" \n \n \u2022 \"Victory is coming soon. Almost half of Aleppo is now with the FSA,\" Abdul Gabbar Kaidi the colonel in charge of the rebel battle for Aleppo told Luke Harding in northern Syria. \n \n In this dark, asymmetric struggle, there is a sense that the rebels are winning, not by great degrees, but slowly and inexorably: an unstoppable human tide. The regime may have succeeded in quelling the rebellion in Damascus, for the moment. But virtually the entire country is in the grip of a popular revolution. The battle for Syria's biggest city, Aleppo ... is desperately poised. The rebels are outgunned, fighting street by street, and up against a mostly invisible enemy that rains death from the skies. \n \n You can see video a interview with Harding in Syria here. \n \n \u2022 Arab nations plan to go to the UN general assembly and seek approval of a resolution calling for a political transition in Syria following the security council's failure to address the escalating crisis, AP reports. Saudi Arabia's Ambassador Abdallah al-Mouallimi and Qatari diplomat Abdulrahman Al-Hamadi announced plans to seek action by the 193-member world body, where there are no vetoes, during a Security Council debate on the Middle East. \n \n \u2022 The head of the UN peacekeeping Herve Ladsous is trying to dismantle the now depleted monitoring mission in Syria, diplomats have told Inner City Press. One claim that Ladsous was deliberately \"misinterpreting\" a resolution to extend the mission for 30 days. \n \n \u2022 The opposition Syrian National Council is poised to set up a base on Syrian soil like the Libyan rebels did in Benghazi, but the divisions appearing to be opening up, writes Ian Black. \n \n The group's leaders will meet in the Qatari capital, Doha, today where SNC sources say that Riyad Seif, a respected dissident, is a leading candidate to head a \"consensus-based\" civilian administration. But Brigadier General Manaf Tlass, the most important member of Assad's inner circle yet to defect, is also being mooted as the head of an Egyptian-style supreme military council that could keep the Syrian armed forces intact and loyal, according to SNC officials and foreign diplomats. \n \n \u2022 Syria's ambassadors to the United Arab Emirates and Cyprus - a married couple - have become the latest senior figures to defect from the regime, the White House has confirmed. Spokesman Jay Carney said: \"This is another indication, we believe, that senior officials around the Assad inner circle are fleeing the government because of the heinous actions taken by Assad against his own people, and the recognition that Assad's days are numbered.\" \n \n \u2022 Arms control campaigners claim a first draft of a UN global arms trade treaty is meaningless as it would not stop weapons shipments from Russia to Syria. Anna Macdonald, Oxfam's head of arms control, said the draft would allow countries to honour existing contracts to states no matter how much circumstances changed. \"This means Russia could continue to supply arms to Syria. That is a key test for us. Would the draft [treaty] stop Russia arming Syria? No it wouldn't,\" she said. \n \n \u2022 The rebel-held town of Azaz (or Izzaz) north of Aleppo is ruins about after weeks of fighting, Reuters reports. \n \n Some houses have collapsed in heaps of rubble, pounded by tank fire, while the remaining buildings stand scorched or pock-marked with bullet holes. Burnt-out tanks struck by rebels' rocket-propelled grenades sit motionless on the town's roads, while spent bullet casings lay strewn across the ground next to an old leather Russian tank helmet. A mosque in the town's centre that served as a base for Assad's army is now all but destroyed, scorched tanks and armoured vehicles immobilised in its courtyard. Sandbags stacked in the mosque's windows mark deserted army sniper positions. \n \n \u2022 The question is not how long Assad can cling to power, but will the authoritarian structure survive him? argues Fawaz Gerges director of the LSE's Middle East Centre. ||||| 1 of 12. A building burns after shelling at Juret al-Shayah in Homs city July 25, 2012. Picture taken July 25, 2012. \n \n AMMAN/BEIRUT (Reuters) - President Bashar al-Assad's forces renewed a ground and aerial bombardment of Aleppo on Friday, extending efforts to crush rebels in Syria's commercial capital in what the United States said it feared could become a massacre. \n \n Insurgents targeted army roadblocks and security installations, with both sides avoiding close-quarters warfare in the city of 2.5 million people, Syria's biggest urban center. \n \n The U.S. State Department said credible reports of tank columns moving on Aleppo, along with air strikes by helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, represented a serious escalation of Assad's efforts to crush a rebellion that began 16 months ago. \n \n \"This is the concern: that we will see a massacre in Aleppo, and that's what the regime appears to be lining up for,\" State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said. \n \n Troops stationed on the outskirts of Aleppo unleashed barrages of heavy-caliber mortar rounds on the western neighborhoods of Saladin, al-Sukkari and al-Fardos, while Russian MI-25 helicopter gunships struck al-Sakhour in the east with rockets, several opposition activists in the city said. \n \n RISING CASUALTIES \n \n In the first reported casualty on Friday, a man of about 60 wearing a traditional white prayer outfit was killed near a park in Saladin. His body was placed in a mosque pending identification. \n \n Thirty-four people were killed in Aleppo and its environs on Thursday, according to opposition activists keeping a tally of casualties in the northern city. \n \n \"The rebels have so far been nimble, and civilians have mostly been the victims of the bombardment,\" said activist Abu Mohammad al-Halabi, speaking by phone from the city. \n \n \"There is lots of internal displacement, and schools have been turned to makeshift shelters that are packed. One shell hitting a school will result in a catastrophe,\" he said. \n \n \"The regime is massing troops and tanks at the entrances of Aleppo, but it seems it is for now content with bombarding the city, with the rebels constantly on the move.\" \n \n Majed al-Nour, another activist, said rebels attacked a security outpost in the neighborhood of Bustan al-Joz, which is close to the Aleppo city center, on Thursday. \n \n \"The rebels are present in the east and west of the city, and have a foothold in areas of the center. The regime forces control the entrances of Aleppo and the main thoroughfares and commercial streets and are bombarding the residential districts that fell into rebel hands,\" he said. \n \n Nour said tens of thousands of people had fled Aleppo to nearby northern rural regions close to Turkey from which the Syrian army has withdrawn in recent weeks to focus on urban areas where relatively lightly armed rebels have hunkered down. \n \n UNITING THE OPPOSITION \n \n The heavy fighting around Aleppo follows an audacious bomb attack that killed four of Assad's closest lieutenants in Damascus on July 18 and led some analysts to speculate that the government's grip was slipping. \n \n With U.N. Security Council resolutions for sanctions against Syria vetoed by Russia and China for a third time last week, the United States has said it is stepping up assistance to Syria's fractured opposition, although it remains limited to non-lethal supplies such as communications gear and medical equipment. \n \n One of the most senior figures to defect from Assad's inner circle, Brigadier General Manaf Tlas, put himself forward on Thursday as someone who could help unify the opposition inside and outside Syria on a plan for a transfer of power. \n \n Tlas, speaking in a newspaper interview in the Saudi city of Jeddah, also said he was looking for support from Saudi Arabia and other powers. \"I am discussing with ... people outside Syria to reach a consensus with those inside,\" Tlas told Thursday's edition of the Saudi newspaper Asharq al-Awsat. \n \n Tlas went on to Turkey and met with Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu. Turkey, a former ally of Assad and now one of his fiercest critics, has a heavy strategic stake in shaping any post-Assad leadership in neighboring Syria. \n \n Tlas appeared briefly with Davutoglu at an official guest house, but made no statement. \n \n Turkey closed its border posts with Syria on Wednesday to all traffic except Syrian refugees. \n \n Russia, one of the few remaining allies of the authoritarian Assad whose family has run Syria for 42 years, said calls for him to quit power were hindering efforts to end the conflict. \n \n Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said such calls, led by the United States, Turkey and other Western and Arab nations, were fanning violence. He reiterated Moscow's contention that support for Syrian rebel groups was tantamount to backing terrorism. \n \n Iran promised to stand by Syria, come what may. \n \n First Vice President Mohammad Reza Rahimi told Iran's Press TV on Thursday that the Islamic Republic's support for Syria, its main Arab ally, was \"unchangeable\", countering suggestions that Iran could soften its backing for Assad. \n \n (Writing by Will Waterman; Editing by Mark Heinrich) ||||| Media caption The BBC's Ian Pannell travels with cheering rebels in Aleppo. His report contains unverified graphic images of the victims of Syria's conflict \n \n Syrian rebels in Aleppo have begun stockpiling ammunition and medical supplies as government forces prepare outside the city for a major battle. \n \n Artillery and helicopter gunships have resumed attacking rebel targets and 14 people have been killed, activists say. \n \n Troops and tanks are said to be ringing the city and reinforcements are reportedly on their way to join them. \n \n In Damascus, activists said the army had pounded the capital's last rebel-held areas and 20 civilians had died. \n \n Five children and four women were killed, according to London-based pro-opposition group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, when shells hit the Yalda area. Helicopters also attacked the nearby district of Hajar al-Aswad. \n \n The government has said its forces are trying to dislodge the \"remnants of mercenary terrorist groups\". \n \n At the scene It is almost inconceivable that President Assad could allow his government to lose control of the city, so it is reasonable to expect that they are going to throw everything they possibly can at the city. And that is what they are preparing for here. One of the neighbourhoods is appealing for more blood supplies. We are hearing reports of hundreds, possibly thousands of families leaving some districts. Everybody is bracing themselves for an intensive campaign. The way it has worked in other cities is that there is an intensive bombardment by artillery and mortars, and then when it starts to go calm, tanks begin to roll in. This is a very congested heavily populated area, so it will be bloody. Rebels surprise regime in Aleppo \n \n Checkpoints and snipers \n \n In Syria's commercial hub of Aleppo, rebels have set up checkpoints and sniper positions and claim to be in control of half of the city. \n \n A Syrian security source was quoted by AFP news agency as saying that special forces had begun arriving on the edges of Aleppo in readiness for a \"generalised counter-offensive on Friday or Saturday\". \n \n A similar account has emerged from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which talks of reinforcements arriving from the main Damascus to Aleppo road to the south. \n \n Columns of troops and tanks are also thought to be travelling from the city of Hama, and from the border posts with Turkey in Idlib province. \n \n Aleppo is the country's commercial capital, and key to the battle to control the north of the country. \n \n Street battles have been reported throughout the city for days, as rebels try to hold on to neighbourhoods captured in an offensive that began at the weekend. \n \n Although it was relatively quiet on Thursday, activists said artillery fire could be heard in the Salah al-Din neighbourhood in the southwest of the city and clashes in Tariq al-Bab in the east had led to two rebels being killed. \n \n Foreign journalists operate under heavy restrictions in Syria so claims made by either side are difficult to verify. \n \n The BBC's Ian Pannell near the city says thousands of people are leaving as fears grow that an intense battle is looming. \n \n He says the rebels are reinforcing their ranks with more fighters, medical supplies, and ammunition such as Kalashnikov rifles. \n \n Talal al-Mayhani, an activist with connections in the rebel movement in Aleppo, said the battle for the city was likely to play out in a similar way to an earlier battle in the capital Damascus, when rebels took control of large parts of the city before being forced to withdraw in the face of a government offensive. \n \n Reporter Laurent Van der Stockt from French newspaper Le Monde told the BBC that Free Syrian Army (FSA) commanders in Aleppo were full of confidence but were lacking weapons. \n \n \"A commander told me this morning they attacked a convoy and destroyed 10 armoured vehicles.\" \n \n Luke Harding of the Guardian newspaper, 50km (30mi) west of Aleppo, told the BBC that much of the rest of Aleppo province was in rebel hands but it was an exaggeration to say they were in control of half of the city. \n \n \"It's true they're in the southern part of the city and the northeast. Tactically, they're doing guerrilla-style attacks and they can melt away quite quickly.\" \n \n In Damascus, where government forces have largely repelled a sustained assault by rebels, state TV reported more clashes in the southern district of Qadam. \n \n The report showed army troops firing intensively as they moved into heavily damaged streets. \n \n The violence also spread to the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp, where activists said street battles had taken place between rebels and soldiers. \n \n More than 16,000 people have been killed in Syria since the start of anti-regime protests in March 2011. \n \n Repeated diplomatic attempts to stop the violence have foundered, with the UN Security Council bitterly divided. \n \n Thousands of refugees have already sought shelter in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq. \n \n And conditions throughout the country have worsened as the fighting has spread and intensified in the two main cities in recent weeks.",

    "document": "Ava DuVernay, left, director of the film \u201cSelma,\u201d and David Oyelowo, the actor who plays Martin Luther King Jr., created a fascinating portrait of King without using his most famous speeches. (Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP) \n \n The arc of history is long, but it has finally bent toward a Martin Luther King movie. \n \n For the first time in the 50 years since Martin Luther King Jr. led the civil rights movement, a feature film is being devoted to a pivotal chapter in the historic struggle, with King at its center. Over the years, several King movie projects have been started, stalled and stopped, either because a filmmaker got cold feet or King\u2019s family \u2014 which controls the rights to his life story and speeches \u2014 didn\u2019t agree to make them available. (They have since sold them to DreamWorks SKG with Steven Spielberg producing.) \n \n \u201cSelma,\u201d a film starring British actor David Oyelowo as King, and directed by Ava DuVernay, is the first film to break that logjam. Both a sweeping epic and an intimate personal portrait, it possesses the scope and epic grandeur that befits its subject, the 1965 march from Selma to Montgomery, Ala., and King\u2019s fight with president Lyndon B. Johnson to secure the Voting Rights Act. But, perhaps more crucially, it depicts King in a new way \u2014 not as a forbidding icon or flawless secular saint, but as a cannily strategic player who equalled Johnson move-for-move in a high-stakes bout of political gamesmanship. \n \n What\u2019s more, \u201cSelma,\u201d which opened in Washington on Thursday, makes the bold move of dispensing with King\u2019s most familiar and famous speeches: Working with an original script by Paul Webb, DuVernay carefully paraphrased King\u2019s oratory, so that the words Oyelowo speaks in the film have King\u2019s cadence and meaning, even when they\u2019re not literal. \n \n The reason is simple: \u201cWe never even asked\u201d for the rights to King\u2019s speeches, said DuVernay during a recent visit to Washington. \u201cBecause we knew those rights are already gone, they\u2019re with Spielberg, and secondly we found a way to do it where we didn\u2019t have to ask for permission, because with those rights came a certain collaboration.\u201d \n \n The result is a fascinating portrait that both eerily captures King, but also feels just a tick off from impersonation. Oyelowo doesn\u2019t physically resemble the civil rights leader, nor does his voice possess quite the ringing timbre most people associate with one of the greatest orators of the 20th century. But the filmmakers\u2019 decision to eschew mimicry liberates \u201cSelma\u201d from being mere hagiographic waxwork, or a series of speeches and set pieces, and allows it to be an authentic drama with fully realized, grounded characters. King, especially, is presented as conflicted, whether the subject is his frequent infidelities or his controversial decision, during the second of three marches from Selma, to turn back instead of moving forward. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m a conflicted, flawed, insecure, at times brilliant, at times nonplussed human being,\u201d Oyelowo said of his characterization of King, \u201cwho is facing obstacles and trying to overcome them.\u201d Oyelowo \u2014 who was attached to play King in \u201cSelma\u201d seven years ago before the project was shelved, and advocated for DuVernay to direct \u2014 believes that this version of King could only have come about with an African American director at the helm. \u201cThere was a study done around the police in a certain state in this country, and they admitted that there is an inherent fear of the black male,\u201d Oyelowo said. \u201cSo subconsciously or consciously, to have black powerful men driving the narrative as protagonists is frightening for America. And frightening for Hollywood. Subconsciously there is an allergy to it.\u201d \n \n This is why, historically, films that have dealt with the civil rights movement have so often been told through the journey of a white character, whether a white FBI agent in \u201cMississippi Burning\u201d or a well-meaning college girl in \u201cThe Help,\u201d Oyelowo suggested. Conversely, he thinks, \u201cSelma\u2019s\u201d nuanced portrayal of King \u201cgives context to who we are as human beings, and hopefully it disintegrates those fears that are out there.\u201d \n \n Because \u201cSelma\u201d deals with such well-documented history, there will surely be quibbles with the compressions and liberties the filmmakers have taken in the name of economy (the film does a remarkable job of swiftly moving through complicated events in just over two hours). For example, Diane Nash and James Bevel, who originated the idea of marching from Selma and finally convinced King, are relegated to the background of a story in which King is by far the most prominent figure. \n \n Still, the fact that Bevel (played by the musician Common) and Nash (Tessa Thompson) and their fellow activists are there at all represents a small victory: The original screenplay for \u201cSelma\u201d was centered almost entirely in the White House, and Johnson\u2019s struggle with King over whether to address voting rights or the War on Poverty. \u201cIt was important to have them in the script, because they weren\u2019t, previously,\u201d DuVernay said, \u201cjust to have them named and have them present.\u201d DuVernay added that she insisted on including a scene when they tell King that Selma\u2019s the right place for the upcoming demonstrations. \u201cIt\u2019s my tip of the hat to them,\u201d the director said. \n \n \u201cThis is the beauty of having Ava be the one to direct it,\u201d Oyelowo added. \u201cPerspective is so key \u2014 in terms of the women, in terms of the politics, in terms of who really brought about this change.\u201d In \u201cSelma\u2019s\u201d first incarnations, he said, \u201cperspective was skewed, I\u2019ll be brutally honest with you, in terms of what this film should be. And it was skewed in a way that has been done so many times before. . . . I\u2019ve watched this thing morph into what it should be, and what other things haven't been and could have been, just by virtue of perspective.\u201d \n \n Oyelowo and DuVernay had received the ultimate imprimatur of that perspective just a few weeks ago, when Oprah Winfrey \u2014 who has a cameo role in \u201cSelma\u201d and is one of the film\u2019s producers \u2014 played host at a screening of the film in Santa Barbara, for members of King\u2019s family and several of the real-life activists who are portrayed in the film, including Nash, Rep. John Lewis and former U.N. ambassador Andrew Young. Not only did Martin Luther King III express his approval, DuVernay added, but someone approached her in the darkened screening room while the end credits were still rolling. \u201cAmbassador Young walked up to me in my chair, put his hands around my face and said, \u2018Well done,\u2019 \u201d DuVernay recalled. \u201c \u2018You did it.\u2019 \u201d ||||| The new film Selma has sparked a bitter public debate, mostly concerning the film\u2019s representation of President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s stance on voting rights and how much artistic license is appropriate for a biopic centering on a major historical event. Less discussed, however, is the degree to which the MLK estate\u2019s tough stance on copyright affected the historical accuracy of the film\u2014and has affected many other films and books before it. What is lost when a biopic cannot take full advantage of its main character\u2019s rhetorical brilliance? And what alternatives are available for filmmakers that want to produce history, not hagiography, about MLK? \n \n Selma director Ava DuVernay may well have taken more license than artistically necessary in the confrontational scenes between Martin Luther King Jr. and President Johnson. But inaccuracies in other significant parts of the film were forced upon DuVernay by copyright law. The film\u2019s numerous scenes of King delivering powerful speeches regarding civil rights all had to be paraphrased, because the MLK estate has already licensed the film rights in those speeches to DreamWorks and Warner Bros., for an MLK biopic Steven Spielberg is slated to produce. \n \n The litigious MLK estate, controlled now by King\u2019s descendants, has a long history of employing copyright to restrict the use of King\u2019s speeches. The estate appears to have two objectives: maximize revenue and control King\u2019s image. In the 1990s, the estate sued USAToday for publishing the full text of the \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech King delivered on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in August 1963, and the newspaper quickly settled by paying for a license and attorneys\u2019 fees. The estate then sued CBS for including footage of the speech in a segment of its documentary series The 20th Century with Mike Wallace. In its defense in court, CBS argued that the speech had entered into the public domain because King had not complied with the notice and registration requirements of the Copyright Act of 1909. The trial court agreed with CBS, but an appellate court reversed and ruled in favor of the MLK estate on narrow technical grounds. (Specifically, although the speech was delivered to a live audience of several hundred thousand people and broadcast to millions more, the appellate court treated the delivery of the speech as only a limited publication of the underlying text that did not trigger the 1909 Act\u2019s notice and registration requirements.) \n \n The MLK estate also sued the producers of Eyes on the Prize, an Emmy-winning documentary series on the civil rights movement, for the use of unlicensed footage of King speeches. This litigation settled when the producers reportedly paid the estate $100,000. Because of this dispute (and similar issues with other rights-holders), the series was out of circulation from 1993 to 2006, when PBS finally renewed most of the rights and edited the remaining unlicensed footage. \n \n During the summer of 2013, as the nation was celebrating the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, the MLK estate restricted broadcasts of \u201cI Have a Dream,\u201d but it did not lock down the speech altogether: It authorized sales of DVDs of the speech, and it licensed AT&T to use segments of the speech in cell phone ads. Over the years, the MLK estate has also licensed King speeches to be used in ads by Alcatel, Apple, Chevrolet and Mercedes. And it received over $700,000 from the foundation erecting the MLK Memorial in Washington, D.C., for the right to use MLK\u2019s speeches and likeness in the Memorial. \n \n How is it that one estate can control the use of speeches so central to American history 50 years after their delivery and 47 years after King\u2019s tragic assassination? \n \n One reason is that King was a private citizen. Had King been a federal government official when he wrote his speeches, those writings would always have been in the public domain. But because King was the extraordinary national political figure who was not a federal employee, the copyrights belonged to him and passed to his estate upon his death. \n \n Another issue is that the term of copyright protection has grown increasingly long. The first copyright act adopted by Congress in 1790 provided a term of protection of 14 years after first publication that could be renewed for an additional 14 years, for a total of 28 years. The initial purpose of the exclusive rights granted by the copyright law was to provide authors with an economic incentive to create works for the public good. At the same time, the duration of the author\u2019s monopoly was limited so as to enable other authors to build on the first artist\u2019s work. \n \n Thanks to aggressive lobbying by publishers, the estates of authors and, more recently, the motion picture studios, Congress has repeatedly extended the copyright term. In 1831, Congress extended it to two 21-year periods after first publication for a total of 42 years; and in 1909, Congress extended the term to two 28-year periods for a total of 56 years. Then, in the 1976 Copyright Act, in an effort to harmonize U.S. law with the international law of the Berne Convention, Congress lengthened the copyright term to the life of the author plus 50 years. In 1998, Congress added 20 more years of protection, to the life of the author plus 70 years, citing the law of the European Union as an international precedent. \n \n The extensions have always been retroactive, applying to works already in existence. Thus, King\u2019s speeches and other writings will not enter the public domain until at least 70 years after his death: January 1, 2039. \n \n In Congress\u2019 rush to please copyright owners, it has lost sight of the balance the founders intended. A term of protection of \u201clife plus 70\u201d grossly exceeds the economic incentive any author needs to create a work while constraining the ability of new artists to build on the original. And term of life plus 70 is particularly unnecessary in the case of Martin Luther King; King did not need any economic incentive to write his eloquent speeches, let alone a term of life plus 70. ||||| The film Selma, a soaring biographical drama about Martin Luther King\u2019s role in the 1965 civil-rights marches, opens nationwide this week. Critics and audiences are lavishing it with praise, but it could have been an even more meaningful film if its producers hadn\u2019t been blocked by the King estate \u2014 represented by a for-profit company, King, Inc. \u2014 from using words from King\u2019s speeches, including \u201cI have a dream.\u201d \n \n Selma still works because filmmaker Ava DuVernay was able to construct phrases that conveyed King\u2019s oratory without using his actual words. King, Inc., is controlled by King\u2019s surviving children and holds the copyright to King\u2019s speeches. It has so aggressively enforced its legal rights as to make it almost impossible to use those speeches without paying a hefty fee. Film rights to King\u2019s speeches have been licensed to Steven Spielberg\u2019s DreamWorks. DuVernay told the Washington Post, \u201cWe knew those rights are already gone, they\u2019re with Spielberg.\u201d \n \n She also noted that she knew there were strings attached to the rights: \u201cWith those rights came a certain collaboration.\u201d In other words, the King estate uses its control over the copyright to control how King is depicted. It\u2019s perhaps no surprise that no major feature film about King has been produced before now. \n \n Recent court cases suggest that DuVernay would have had a strong \u201cfair use\u201d defense for using some excerpts of King speeches. But she apparently decided it wasn\u2019t worth the risk of litigation. As recently as 2013, that risk prevented many media outlets from using anything more than the briefest of snippets in commemorating the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington and the \u201cI have a dream\u201d speech. \n \n The risk is real. When Clarence Jones, who was a personal attorney and speechwriter for King, was told by attorneys from King, Inc., that if he wanted to use the full speech in his book Behind the Dream: The Making of the Speech That Transformed a Nation, he would have to pay $20,000. \n \n \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for me copyrighting that speech, the King children wouldn\u2019t today own their biggest moneymaker,\u201d Jones complained. He said his small publisher feared a lawsuit, so he as the author had to indemnify them from any costs of such a suit. He then dared King family lawyers to sue the man who helped write \u201cI have a dream.\u201d They chose not to. \n \n But there are many other occasions when the legal threats have prevailed. In 1996, the King estate sued CBS for using portions of \u201cI have a dream.\u201d CBS settled the suit by making a donation to the family\u2019s King Center. The family had earlier sued USA Today for reprinting the speech\u2019s text and won another out-of-court settlement and an apology. The band Living Colour wanted to start its 1988 iconic song \u201cCult of Personality\u201d with Martin Luther King saying, \u201cFree at last! Free at last! / Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!\u201d But guitarist Vernon Reed recalls that \u201cwe couldn\u2019t get approval from the King foundation to use that.\u201d They substituted a quote from Malcolm X. \n \n \u201cI think Martin Luther King must be spinning in his grave,\u201d former King lieutenant Bill Rutherford told CBS in 2002 in complaining about the restrictions on King\u2019s words. \u201cHe attempted his entire life to communicate ideas for free. To communicate, not to sell.\u201d \n \n No one is safe from the King, Inc., lawyers. Apple, Chevrolet, and Mercedes have been able to use King\u2019s words in their commercials only after paying hefty licensing fees. A T-shirt company has been licensed to produce products that \u201ccelebrate Dr. King\u2019s life and legacy through artistic, fashion-forward designs.\u201d \n \n But the group that was behind raising $100 million to build the King monument on the National Mall had to drop its name \u2014 the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Foundation \u2014 in 2013 because King, Inc., demanded it pay a licensing fee. \u201cAt one point as the memorial was ready to be dedicated, King, Inc., had all of Dr. King\u2019s books removed from the bookstore on the site of the memorial. The King children wanted to control the bookstore and reap all profits from the selling of merchandise,\u201d Roland Martin, a former CNN commentator who was active in building the memorial, has complained. \u201cAll of this despite the foundation paying MLK children through King, Inc., $2.7 million to use the likeness of King and his quotes on the memorial on the National Mall.\u201d \n \n Family lawyers hunt down scholars who would use King\u2019s words. Eyes on the Prize, the PBS documentary on the civil-rights movement, was delayed until the producers made a $100,000 payment to the King family. Julian Bond, head of the NAACP, says the price of his civil-rights textbook went up by at least $10 a copy because he had to pay to include four King documents in it. \u201cThe family hasn\u2019t done itself a lot of favors with its insistence that somehow they have to profit,\u201d Bond said. \n \n Hosea Williams, who in 1968 stood with Dr. King on the motel balcony where he was shot, told the Ottawa Citizen that the profiteering has sullied the King message of humility. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t white racists, nor was it the white government that did it; the people who killed King\u2019s dream are those closest to him, and that\u2019s the nightmare,\u201d he said. \n \n Managers for the King estate insist they are on firm legal ground and that other prominent figures have copyrighted their works for themselves and their estates. \u201cWe cannot allow our brand to be abused,\u201d says Isaac Newton Farris Jr., King\u2019s nephew and an executive of the nonprofit King Center in Atlanta. \n \n Understood, although I never thought of MLK Jr. as a \u201cbrand\u201d before. As copyright lawyer Jonathan Band notes: \u201cThe Selma speeches occurred 50 years ago and, under a rational intellectual property regime, should be entering the public domain. This is something for Congress to consider in 2015 as it continues to review U.S. copyright policy; rather than simply focusing on enforcement, it should also restore a balance between protecting artists and protecting free expression.\u201d \n \n So even though King, Inc., is within its legal rights, one can\u2019t help thinking that Dr. King himself would look askance at all this. He was a fundamentally modest man, who just before his death spoke of how he should be remembered: \u201cTell them not to mention that I have a Nobel Peace Prize. That isn\u2019t important. . . . I want you to be able to say that day . . . that I tried to love and serve humanity.\u201d \n \n Indeed. Let us hope that the message of \u201cI have a dream\u201d isn\u2019t devalued by some who have appropriated his memory into the more mercenary one of \u201cWe have a brand!\u201d \n \n Martin Luther King Jr. is a national hero whose legacy belongs to the American people. Sadly, the lawyers for some members of Dr. King\u2019s family don\u2019t see it that way. \n \n \u2014 John Fund is national-affairs columnist for National Review Online.",

One reason for that is that the production budget of the show was not reduced when Leno moved back to late night after his ill-fated stint in prime time during the 2009-10 television season. \n \n Leno's current salary is between $25 million and $30 million and he volunteered to take a cut if it would save some jobs. A person close to the network thought Leno's new salary is likely around $20 million. Bruce Bobbins, one of Leno's spokesmen, declined to comment. \n \n [Updated at 10:49 a.m., Aug. 18: In a statement later Bobbins said, \"Jay's foremost concern is for the wonderful people who work for 'The Tonight Show.' He did what was necessary to ensure their well-being.\"] \n \n While an NBC spokeswoman declined to comment on the situation, the job losses are said to be between 20 and 25 people and many other senior staffers also agreed to pay cuts. \n \n The weekly budget for Leno's prime time show was approximately $2.3 million and it stayed there when he returned to late night and Conan O'Brien was sent packing. The budget now will be closer to $1.7 million, which is in the range of what it was during Leno's previous late-night stint. \n \n Leno is not the first late-night host to agree to a salary reduction. In 2009, CBS restructured David Letterman's deal and reduced his salary and the budget of the show. \n \n Whether NBC will look to other areas to make additional cuts is yet to be determined. Earlier this year, the network trimmed its marketing and promotions staff. \n \n News of the cuts were first reported by Deadline Hollywood. \n \n ALSO: \n \n Movie review: 'Cosmopolis' \n \n Moviegoers still wary of theaters after Aurora shootings \n \n Robert Pattinson tries to separate professional and personal lives ||||| Related: Tonight Show Cuts Latest In Wave Of NBC Layoffs & Cost Trims Imposed By Comcast \n \n SATURDAY UPDATE: Jay Leno\u2019s spokesman has now issued this statement: \u201dJay\u2019s foremost concern is for the wonderful people who work for The Tonight Show. He did what was necessary to ensure their well-being.\u201d \n \n BREAKING\u2026 EXCLUSIVE\u2026 FRIDAY 8:30 PM: NBC insiders tell me The Tonight Show went through \u201ddownsizing\u201d today and that 20 staffers lost their jobs. Others tell me the number is more like 25, and producers were forced to take pay cuts or lose their jobs. I\u2019ve also learned that Jay Leno took what is being described as a \u201ctremendous\u201d pay cut to \u201csave as many people\u2019s jobs as he could\u201d. Leno\u2019s Tonight Show is consistently the #1 late night talk show in both households and demographics, except for some anomalies when Leno does get beaten. And that\u2019s despite the fact that the network\u2019s primetime ratings have been dismal for many years or that Leno himself was harshly criticized by the media for that January 2010 standoff with Conan O\u2019Brien. Even so, The Tonight Show has been and still is a cash cow for NBC. So what happened to merit the downsizing? \u201cI don\u2019t think ad sales are off. I just think the people who bought this company, Comcast, wants to go through everything at NBC and get their money back,\u201d an NBC insider tells me. \u201dIt\u2019s hard to go through those kinds of cuts. It\u2019s more a network issue than a late-night issue. And I would say that Jay doesn\u2019t get credit for digging out of a gigantic hole every single night. He\u2019s a very valuable guy to NBC and someday everyone will understand that. He does a great job.\u201d \n \n Related: Gabby Douglas & Michelle Obama Give \u2018Tonight Show\u2019 A Bump \n \n The downsizing also comes just 5 days after First Lady Michelle Obama appeared as a guest for the third time on The Tonight Show: high unemployment, job creation, and taxing the rich vs the poor all are issues in the 2012 president campaign. Leno has said publicly that he\u2019s able to bank his entire Tonight Show salary and live on the hefty fees he makes from his hectic personal appearance schedule. Leno\u2019s new salary is reportedly $27M-$30 million a year. He reportedly brings home another $15M-$20M a year from his other gigs. \n \n Leno replaced Johnny Carson as host of The Tonight Show in 1992 after having been a regular substitute host since 1987. He \u201cofficially\u201d ended hosting of The Tonight Show in 2009 when Conan O\u2019Brien started on June 1st. Leno was going to be paid for all of 2009 by NBC even though he was only working six months of it. When his ratings dipped, O\u2019Brien was asked to move The Tonight Show\u2018s time slot later to make room for Leno\u2019s return at 11:30 PM. O\u2019Brien refused. NBC gave Conan a $40M payoff (including salaries for his staff) to leave The Tonight Show hosting job which Leno resumed in 2010. \n \n Related: Gabby Douglas & Michelle Obama Give \u2018Tonight Show\u2019 A Bump \n \n Jay Leno Celebrates 20th Anniversary Hosting \u2018The Tonight Show\u2019 \n \n Jimmy Kimmel Bests Leno & Letterman \n \n Editor-in-Chief Nikki Finke - tip her here.",

Finke's numbers are higher. According to both accounts, Leno volunteered to take the cuts to save jobs, though at least 20 people got layoffs. Why the downsizing? Finke says it's not because of concerns about ratings or ad revenue, but because parent company Comcast is demanding cuts all around.

Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen have a lot of explaining to do.https://www.dropbox.com/s/pskgpwr15r48tx5/Executive%20Summary.pdf?dl=0 \u2026 ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n / Updated By Sarah Fitzpatrick, Tracy Connor, Tom Winter and Ben Collins \n \n Stormy Daniels' attorney claimed Tuesday that President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen received $500,000 from a company controlled by a Russian oligarch, deposited into an account for a company also used to pay off the adult film actress. \n \n Daniels' attorney, Michael Avenatti, also detailed other transactions he said were suspicious, including deposits from drug giant Novartis, the state-run Korea Aerospace Industries, and AT&T. \n \n Novartis confirmed it had paid Cohen's company, Essential Consultants, and said Special Counsel Robert Mueller had inquired about the arrangement in November. AT&T also confirmed it paid Cohen's company, for \"insights\" into the Trump administration. \n \n Avenatti's claims, made in a dossier posted to Twitter, could suggest a new dimension to the federal investigation into Cohen. NBC News has reviewed financial documents that appear to support Avenatti\u2019s account of the transactions. \n \n \"This thing is a pig and they can try to put lipstick on a pig \u2014 tonight, next week, next month \u2014 but it's still gonna be a pig,\" Avenatti said on MSNBC's \"The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell.\" \n \n \"This thing's ugly and it's gonna get worse.\" \n \n Cohen disputed Avenatti's accounting but provided no details. \n \n \"His document is inaccurate,\" he said as he left a Manhattan hotel and got into a cab Wednesday morning. \n \n Avenatti said his investigation uncovered that $4.4 million flowed through a First Republic account linked to Essential Consultants between October 2016 and January 2018. Essential Consultants is the company Cohen created before the 2016 election and then used to wire $130,000 to Daniels to stop her from going public with her account of an alleged sexual affair with Trump a decade ago. \n \n In particular, Avenatti identified eight transactions between January and August 2017, totaling half a million dollars, from U.S.-based Columbus Nova, which he said is controlled by Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg and Vekselberg's cousin Andrew Intrater. \n \n In a statement, an attorney for Columbus Nova said the management firm is owned and controlled by Americans and not Vekselberg, who is the president of the Russian conglomerate Renovo Group. \n \n \"After the inauguration, the firm hired Michael Cohen as a business consultant regarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures,\" the Columbus Nova statement said. \n \n \"Reports today that Viktor Vekselberg used Columbus Nova as a conduit for payments to Michael Cohen are false. The claim that Viktor Vekselberg was involved or provided any funding for Columbus Nova's engagement of Michael Cohen is patently untrue. \n \n \"Neither Viktor Vekselberg nor anyone else other than Columbus Nova's owners, were involved in the decision to hire Cohen or provided funding for his engagement.\" \n \n This thing is a pig and they can try to put lipstick on a pig \u2014 tonight, next week, next month \u2014 but it's still gonna be a pig. \n \n Columbus Nova was listed on the website of the Renova Group as one of its \"companies\" until November 2017. Renova's website is now listed as \"under construction,\" but older versions remain on The Wayback Machine, which creates archives of sites across the web. \n \n In a statement, Columbus Nova's attorney said the firm \"has managed assets on behalf of Renova Group companies and other clients. Columbus Nova itself is not now, and has never been, owned by any foreign entity or person including Viktor Vekselberg or the Renova Group.\" \n \n A review of public election filings shows that the CEO of Columbus Nova, Andrew Intrater, made several political donations over the past two years. \n \n According to public record filings he donated $29,600 to the Republican National Committee in June 2017, $35,000 to the Trump Victory PAC the same month, and then $250,000 to the Trump Inauguration Fund. Columbus Nova has also registered many alt-right internet domains, though the domains return an error message. \n \n Russian President Vladimir Putin meets with Renova Group Board Chairman and Skolkovo Foundation President Viktor Vekselberg at the Kremlin in Moscow on March 14, 2017.

He noted reports that said Trump met with Novartis' CEO in January 2018. In a statement, Novartis said it had a one-year agreement with Essential Consultants, \"focused on U.S. healthcare policy matters,\" that expired in February. It was contacted in November by Mueller's office and \"cooperated fully,\" it said. \n \n AT&T made four payments of $50,000 each to Essential in late 2017 and early 2018. In a statement, AT&T said it engaged the firm in early 2017 to \"provide insights into understanding the new administration.

One of Trump's new attorneys, former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, said last week that Trump repaid the money to Cohen. ||||| FILE - In this Thursday, April 26, 2018, file photo, Michael Avenatti, Stormy Daniels' attorney, talks to reporters outside of federal court in New York. Avenatti says he has information showing that... (Associated Press) \n \n WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Stormy Daniels' lawyer said Tuesday he has information showing that Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's longtime personal attorney, received $500,000 from a company associated with a Russian billionaire within months of paying hush money to Daniels, a porn star who claims she had an affair with Trump. \n \n Lawyer Michael Avenatti also said hundreds of thousands of dollars streamed into Cohen's account from companies, including pharmaceutical giant Novartis, AT&T and Korea Aerospace, with U.S. government business interests. AT&T confirmed its connection Tuesday evening. \n \n Avenatti did not reveal the source of his information or release documentation. But in a seven-page memo, Avenatti detailed what he said were wire transfers going into and out of the account Cohen used to pay Daniels $130,000 in October 2016 to stay silent about her alleged affair with the soon-to-be president. Trump denies having an affair with Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. \n \n Financial documents reviewed Tuesday by The Associated Press appeared to back up Avenatti's report. \n \n The memo, containing highly specific dates and amounts, stated that Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian billionaire, and his cousin \"routed\" eight payments totaling approximately $500,000 to Cohen's company, Essential Consultants, between January and August 2017. The reason for the payment was not known. \n \n Speculating without offering proof, the Avenatti memo said, \"It appears these funds may have replenished the account following the payment to Ms. Clifford.\" \n \n Avenatti's memo said the deposits into the account controlled by Cohen were made by Columbus Nova, an American investment company affiliated with the Renova Group, which is controlled by Vekselberg. \n \n Columbus Nova's attorney Richard Owens stressed in a statement that the company is \"solely owned and controlled by Americans\" and said that, after Trump's inauguration, the firm hired Cohen as a business consultant \"regarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures,\" but that it had nothing to do with Vekselberg. \n \n Owens said any suggestion that Vekselberg used Columbus Nova as a conduit for payments to Cohen was false. \"Neither Viktor Vekselberg nor anyone else, other than Columbus Nova's owners, were involved in the decision to hire Cohen or provided funding for his engagement,\" he said. \n \n Cohen and his attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Cohen is currently under investigation by federal prosecutors in New York, but hasn't been charged. \n \n At the time of the payments, there was an active FBI counterintelligence investigation \u2014 which special counsel Robert Mueller took over last May \u2014 into Russian election interference and any possible coordination with Trump associates. \n \n Vekselberg was targeted for U.S. sanctions by the Trump administration last month. He built his fortune, currently estimated by Forbes at $14.6 billion, by investing in the aluminum and oil industries. More recently, he has expanded his assets to include industrial equipment and high technology. \n \n Offering confirmation for more of the payments, AT&T said in a statement that Essential Consultants was one of several firms it \"engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration.\" \n \n Avenatti alleged that the company made four $50,000 payments to Cohen totaling $200,000 in late 2017 and early 2018. \n \n AT&T said Cohen's company \"did no legal or lobbying work for us, and the contract ended in December 2017.\" Cohen is not a registered lobbyist, according to public records. \n \n Such a confidential relationship would not violate federal lobbying laws if Cohen did not seek to influence Trump on the companies' behalf. But hiring the president's personal attorney for advice on how to woo Trump would be highly unusual, especially given that Cohen was never formally involved in the campaign or Trump's administration. \n \n Making the arrangement even stranger, the blue-chip companies' payments to Cohen were routed to Essential Consultants LLC \u2014 the same company Cohen used to buy Stormy Daniels' silence about her alleged affair with the President. \n \n Trump's Justice Department has sued to block AT&T from an $85 billion merger with Time Warner, saying it would hurt competition and consumers would have to pay more to watch their favorite shows. \n \n Korea Aerospace, which is alleged to have paid Cohen $150,000 in November 2017, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Novartis, a multinational pharmaceutical company, could not confirm or deny the payment, but said any agreements with Essential Consultants were entered before the company's current CEO took over in February of this year and have since expired. \n \n The memo alleges the company paid Cohen $399,920 in late 2017 and early 2018 in four payments \u2014 each amounting to $99,980. \n \n Trump had dinner with Novartis' soon-to-be CEO Vasant Narasimhan, along with other European executives, at the World Economic Forum in Davos shortly after the date of the final payment. \n \n Larry Noble, senior director of the Campaign Legal Center, said there's nothing technically wrong with companies like Novartis and AT&T hiring people like Cohen to provide insight into the president's thinking. But he said the arrangement described by Avenatti \"certainly doesn't look good.\" \n \n \"Why would you go to the president's private fixer?\" he asked. \"He's not known for policy and he's not in the administration. You're going to someone who can get you access and tell you about the person of the president. That's unusual.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Chad Day and Jeff Horwitz in Washington, Jake Pearson in New York and Mike Balsamo in Los Angeles contributed to this report. ||||| (CNN) Special counsel Robert Mueller 's investigators have questioned a Russian oligarch about hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments his company's US affiliate made to President Donald Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, after the election, according to a source familiar with the matter. \n \n Viktor Vekselberg, chairman of asset manager Renova Group, is an oligarch close to Vladimir Putin, and last month the Trump administration placed him on a list of sanctioned Russians for activities including election interference. The purpose of the payments, which predate the sanctions, and the nature of the business relationship between Vekselberg and Cohen is unclear. \n \n The scrutiny of the payments could add to the legal troubles for Cohen, whose home and office were raided last month as part of a criminal investigation by federal prosecutors in Manhattan. In court documents, the prosecutors said at least part of their inquiry stemmed from a referral from Mueller's office. \n \n The questions asked of Vekselberg suggest that Mueller investigators have been examining some of Cohen's business relationships as part of the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Vekselberg is one of two Russian oligarchs the FBI stopped earlier this year after their private jets landed in New York-area airports as part of Mueller's investigation. \n \n Investigators also asked Vekselberg about donations the head of his US affiliate made to Trump's inaugural fund and campaign funds, sources said. \n \n The attorney for Stormy Daniels -- the porn star who received $130,000 to keep quiet about an alleged affair she had with Trump a decade ago -- produced information Tuesday evening that appears to add further details to CNN's reporting. Michael Avenatti alleged that Cohen received half a million dollars from a company affiliated with Vekselberg in the months after the presidential election. \n \n Avenatti alleged the $500,000 went into the bank account for Essential Consultants, a shell company that Cohen set up before the election that was used to pay Daniels. Avenatti added that the payments occurred from January to August 2017. \n \n CNN has reviewed documents that appear to show these payments. CNN has not independently authenticated the documents. \n \n Prosecutors have not accused Cohen of wrongdoing in regard to the payments or any other business dealings. \n \n What FBI agents wanted to know \n \n FBI agents asked Vekselberg about payments his company's American affiliate, Columbus Nova, made to Cohen, according to one source. The Russian was questioned as well about $300,000 in political donations by Andrew Intrater, Vekselberg's American cousin who is the head of Columbus Nova, sources said. \n \n Intrater was also questioned by Mueller's investigators, two sources told CNN. Last month, Vekselberg was placed on the US government's list of sanctioned individuals, prohibiting him from traveling to the US. \n \n The payments occurred at the same time Cohen was trying to build a consulting and legal business after the election and around the time he left the Trump Organization. At that time, he was still Trump's personal lawyer. Even last month, as Trump responded to questions about the payment to Daniels, the President deferred to Cohen and said, \"Michael is my attorney.\" \n \n In court filings, Cohen's attorney said that Cohen has seven clients for whom he provides \"strategic advice and business consulting.\" The attorney did not specify whether Columbus Nova was one of those clients. \n \n After publication, Columbus Nova provided a statement from its attorney, Richard Owens. \n \n \"Columbus Nova is a management company solely owned and controlled by Americans,\" the statement said. \"After the inauguration, the firm hired Michael Cohen as a business consultant regarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures. Reports today that Viktor Vekselberg used Columbus Nova as a conduit for payments to Michael Cohen are false. The claim that Viktor Vekselberg was involved or provided any funding for Columbus Nova's engagement of Michael Cohen is patently untrue. Neither Viktor Vekselberg nor anyone else other than Columbus Nova's owners, were involved in the decision to hire Cohen or provided funding for his engagement.\" \n \n Later Tuesday, Eric Kosta, general counsel of Columbus Nova, sent this statement: \"As the General Counsel of Columbus Nova, I can confirm that the company is 100% owned and controlled by Americans. Any suggestion that at any point in time Viktor Vekselberg or any of his companies owned or exercised any control over Columbus Nova is patently untrue.\" \n \n Intrater did not respond to requests for comment. An attorney for Vekselberg did not respond to a request for comment, nor did representatives for his company in Russia. Cohen did not respond to a request for comment. \n \n Prosecutors with the US attorney's office in Manhattan are investigating Cohen's personal financial dealings, including his taxi business and payments made to silence Daniels, sources have told CNN. The FBI raided Cohen's home, office and hotel room last month, seizing at least eight boxes of documents and more than a dozen electronic devices. Cohen's attorney said the inquiry was referred by Mueller's team. \n \n Campaign donations under scrutiny \n \n Vekselberg's cousin Intrater gave generously to support Trump. \n \n He donated $250,000 to the Trump inauguration fund, $35,000 to the Trump Victory Fund, and $29,600 to the Republican National Committee in June 2017, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. \n \n While it is illegal for foreigners to donate to US politics, Intrater is American. \n \n However, the donations were a sharp increase from previous cycles and may raise questions for investigators. Intrater's only previous political donations included $1,200 to Democrat Bill Richardson's presidential run in 2008 and $2,600 in 2014 for Republican Chris Day's congressional race in New York. Renova Group donated between $50,000 and $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation, but it's not clear when the contribution occurred, according to the foundation's public list of donors. \n \n Vekselberg may also be of interest to investigators because of his close ties to the Kremlin. He built his fortune following the collapse of the Soviet Union through a series of deals in the oil and gas sector. In 2004, he paid over $100 million to buy nine Faberge eggs from the American Forbes family, returning the second-largest collection of imperial eggs to Russia. Six years later, he was appointed by then-Russian president Dmitry Medvedev to lead the Skolkovo Innovation Center project, the Kremlin's answer to Silicon Valley. \n \n From 2007 until March 2012, Vekselberg was a shareholder and chairman of the board of Rusal, the aluminum company controlled by Oleg Deripaska. Deripaska has business ties to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who has been indicted on fraud and tax related charges as part of Mueller's investigation. Manafort has pleaded not guilty. Deripaska, who also was added to the US sanctions list last month, has sued Manafort over a soured investment deal. \n \n Lamesa Investments Ltd, an affiliate of Renova, acquired a large stake in the Bank of Cyprus at the same time Wilbur Ross, then a private equity investor, made a capital infusion into the then-struggling bank.

(Seth Wenig/AP) \n \n President Trump\u2019s personal attorney Michael Cohen was hired last year by the U.S.-based affiliate of a Russian business magnate who attended Trump\u2019s inauguration and was recently subjected to sanctions by the U.S. government, the company said Tuesday. \n \n The New York investment firm Columbus Nova said it retained Cohen as a consultant \u201cregarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures.\u201d Though Columbus Nova has been described in federal regulatory filings as an affiliate of the Renova Group, founded by Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg, the company said Vekselberg was not involved with hiring or paying Cohen. \n \n The company\u2019s confirmation came after Michael Avenatti, a lawyer for adult-film actress Stormy Daniels, circulated on Twitter a document purporting to show a detailed accounting of wire transfers made to Essential Consultants, a company established by Cohen in October 2016. \n \n The payments listed in the document began in the months after Cohen paid $130,000 to Daniels just before the November 2016 election, as part of an agreement that required her to not speak publicly about an affair she says she had with Trump a decade earlier. \n \n In the document, Avenatti claims that Cohen received $500,000 from Columbus Nova between January 2017 and August 2017. \n \n Avenatti did not provide supporting documentation for his claims, though Columbus Nova and AT&T;, another company named in the document, both released statements in the hours after Avenatti\u2019s disclosure confirming that they had business relationships with Cohen. \n \n Avenatti alleged that Vekselberg might have provided funds that \u201creplenished the account\u201d following Cohen\u2019s payments to Daniels. In a statement, a spokesman for Vekselberg said neither the Russian billionaire nor the Renova Group has any \u201ccontractual relationship\u201d with Cohen. \n \n [Analysis: How money flowed through Michael Cohen\u2019s multipurpose shell company] \n \n The payments from Columbus Nova point to a potential new financial tie between the president\u2019s personal lawyer and a U.S. representative of a key Russian figure. Vekselberg, who is close to Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin, was one of two dozen Russian business executives and government officials sanctioned in April as part of the U.S. response to the poisoning of a former Russian intelligence officer in southern England. \n \n Columbus Nova hired Cohen as U.S. investigators were ramping up their inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The chief executive of the U.S. affiliate is Vekselberg\u2019s cousin, Andrew Intrater, a U.S. citizen who donated $250,000 to Trump\u2019s inauguration and made additional contributions to a Trump campaign committee and to the Republican National Committee. \n \n More broadly, the revelations show that companies with business interests before the U.S. government hired Cohen, a longtime Trump associate, by paying him through Essential Consultants, which he also used to pay Daniels before the election. \n \n The document from Avenatti says AT&T; paid Cohen $50,000 a month for four months starting in October 2017, just weeks before Trump\u2019s Justice Department filed suit to block AT&T;\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner. \n \n A spokesman for AT&T; confirmed that the company engaged Essential Consultants, a company formed by Cohen in early 2017, \u201cto provide insights into understanding the new administration.\u201d \n \n \u201cThey did no legal or lobbying work for us, and the contract ended in December 2017,\u201d the spokesman added. \n \n Cohen was receiving payments from Columbus Nova during the same months that Trump attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani has said Trump was paying Cohen $35,000 a month in legal fees. \n \n Giuliani has said Trump\u2019s money served as a reimbursement for the funds Cohen provided to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. \n \n Stephen Ryan, a lawyer for Cohen, did not respond to requests for comment. \n \n Cohen\u2019s finances are of intense interest to federal authorities in New York, who last month served search warrants on his home, office and hotel room, gathering documents related to the Daniels payment as well as to Cohen\u2019s personal businesses. \n \n Cohen\u2019s lawyers have fought in court to restrict prosecutors\u2019 access to the material seized in those raids. As part of that legal fight, they told a judge that in 2017, Cohen had three legal clients and seven clients to whom he provided \u201cstrategic advice and business consulting.\u201d \n \n Avenatti\u2019s document might provide a road map to those clients. He claims that Cohen also received payments from the drug company Novartis Investments and from Korea Aerospace Industries. Each has important business considerations with the U.S. government. \n \n Shortly after the last transaction from Novartis identified by Avenatti, in January, Trump met with executives including the incoming CEO of Novartis, Vas Narasimhan, during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \n \n A Novartis spokesman said any agreements with Essential Consultants took place before the new CEO took over in February and have since expired. \n \n Korea Aerospace is in contention for a multibillion-dollar joint contract with Lockheed Martin to produce jet trainers for the U.S. Air Force. A company representative confirmed paying the Cohen company, but said the payments were to provide legal consulting to assist in the company\u2019s reorganization of its \u201cinternal accounting system\u201d and did not involve the Air Force deal or other lobbying. \n \n The company added that it learned only recently of Essential Consultants\u2019 Trump ties. \n \n In a Wednesday morning tweet, Avenatti said it was \u201cpriceless\u201d to watch the various companies that paid Cohen try to explain their reasons for doing so. \n \n \u201cWatching all of the companies that sent money to the LLC slush fund come up with different alleged reasons for hiring Mr. Cohen \u2014 \u2018accounting advice,\u2019 \u2018real estate consulting,\u2019 \u2018insight,\u2019 etc. Who knew Mr. Cohen was such a brilliant renaissance man?\u201d \n \n Vekselberg is a Russian billionaire who regularly participates in gatherings of Russian business leaders with Putin and sometimes meets one on one with the Russian president, according to news accounts and people familiar with his role. \n \n In March 2017, the two sat down to discuss infrastructure projects, according to Russian state news reports. Vekselberg funds several critically important prestige projects, including Skolkovo, the business incubator touted as Russia\u2019s answer to Silicon Valley. \n \n Vekselberg\u2019s spokesman Andrey Shtorkh confirmed to The Washington Post in January that Vekselberg had attended Trump\u2019s inauguration as a guest of one of his American business partners. \n \n A person familiar with the inauguration said the partner was Intrater, and the New York Times has reported that Intrater and Vekselberg have both been interviewed by prosecutors working for special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. \n \n Two people familiar with Mueller\u2019s probe told The Post that the special counsel is investigating whether foreign money helped fund Trump\u2019s inauguration. By law, only U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents can donate to a U.S. inaugural committee. \n \n In addition to Intrater\u2019s donation to Trump\u2019s inauguration, an additional $1 million to support the inauguration came from Access Industries, which was founded by Leonard Blavatnik, a Soviet-born American British billionaire who is a longtime friend and business associate of Vekselberg. \n \n Shtorkh told The Post in January that Vekselberg had met the past three U.S. presidents as part of his efforts to expand Russia\u2019s international economic relations but that this was the first time the magnate attended a presidential inauguration. \n \n Photographs also show that Vekselberg attended a December 2015 dinner in Moscow to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Russian television network RT. Another attendee of the dinner, seated next to Putin, was Michael Flynn, who later became Trump\u2019s national security adviser. \n \n Alice Crites, Carol D.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Michael Cohen's legal woes appeared to deepen Tuesday night with a bombshell release from Stormy Daniels' attorney. According to financial records reviewed by the New York Times and NBC News, a company linked to a Russian oligarch targeted by US sanctions deposited around $500,000 into an account controlled by Essential Consultants, the shell company Cohen used to pay hush money to Daniels before the 2016 election. Michael Avenatti alleges that funds from oligarch Viktor Vekselberg may have \"replenished the account\" in a series of payments in 2017 after the Daniels settlement, though Columbus Nova, a US affiliate of a Vekselberg company, denies that he was involved in its payments to Trump's personal lawyer, the Washington Post reports. The purpose of the company's payments is unclear. Sources tell CNN that Robert Mueller's investigators have already quizzed Vekselberg about the payments to Cohen's company. Records reviewed by the Times show that around $4.4 million flowed through the Essential Consultants account between its creation weeks before the 2016 election and January this year, including hundreds of thousands of dollars from pharmaceutical firm Novartis, AT&T, and Korea Aerospace. AT&T confirmed the payments late Tuesday, saying Cohen's firm was among those it \"engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration,\" the AP reports. Cohen isn't a registered lobbyist, and while the unusual payments may not have broken any laws, Trump and his attorney \"have a lot of explaining to do,\" Avenatti said in a tweet Tuesday.",

Anti-extremism campaigns have in the past focused on Iraq in particular, and were often shorter videos with a grimmer approach, little musicality and tag lines such as \u201cterrorism has no religion\u201d. \n \n The Zain spot faced criticism from social media users even as some praised its tackling of a sensitive topic, with many Syrians condemning its use of an actor to play Omran, pointing out that the boy was wounded in an airstrike by the regime of Bashar al-Assad rather than in an attack by Muslim extremists.

PATROLS ARE BEING STEPPED UP AT ONE TROUBLED COMPLEX IN ORANGE COUNTY AFTER A SPIKE IN DRUG OVERDOSES. POLICE SAY AT LEAST ONE OF THEM WAS DEADLY. THIS IS NEAR THE BEACHLINE AND ORANGE BLOSSOM TRAIL. DEPUTIES SAY IN THE LAST 24 HOURS, AT LEAST 11 PEOPLE OVERDOSED ON HEROINE IN THAT AREA. THE SHERIFF SAYS SOME OF THE VICTIMS ARE ONLY IN THEIR 20'S. WHILE IT IS AN OLD DRUG, IT IS NEW TO MANY PEOPLE. PEOPLE DYING OF HEROINE OVERDOSES AND WHAT HAVE YOU, THEY ARE IN THEIR 20'S, 30'S, THEIR 40'S. THESE ARE NOT INDIVIDUALS USING IN THE '60S, THE '70S AND THE '80S. \n \n ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. - \n \n The Orange County Sheriff's Office said Thursday that at least 11 heroin overdoses were reported in a 24-hour span in the area of Blossom Park. \n \n Deputies said many of the overdose victims have ended up in the hospital, and some of the victims have died. \n \n OCSO said deputies were sent to the the area to ensure there is a high visibility of law enforcement in hopes of preventing the sale and usage of heroin in the area. ||||| CEDAR RAPIDS \u2014 One narcotics law enforcement officer says taking heroin is similar to grabbing a loaded gun and spinning the chamber. \n \n Even worse, he added, heroin use is spreading in Iowa, and its deadly reach is likely to continue to grow. \n \n Heroin overdoses, for example, have surged in Cedar Rapids in the past five years. \n \n In 2009, authorities responded to nine reported heroin-related deaths and non-fatal overdoses, which represented 45 percent of all overdoses in Cedar Rapids. \n \n Through June 5 of this year, there have been 52 reported overdoses in the city, 44 of which were heroin-related. Heroin has accounted for 85 percent of all overdose calls this year. \n \n \u201cIt's a serious issue \u2014 not just the presence of heroin, but the effects that heroin is having on the users,\u201d Cedar Rapids Police Chief Wayne Jerman said. \u201cThe number of overdoses and the number of overdose deaths is very concerning.\u201d \n \n Cedar Rapids is not alone in facing a growing heroin epidemic. One way to gauge the prevalence of heroin in Iowa and where it is being found is through samples, or exhibits, submitted to the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation Criminalistics Laboratory. According to statistics provided by the crime lab, 37 of Iowa's 99 counties have submitted suspected heroin to the lab for testing since 2005. \n \n However, three Eastern Iowa counties make up a majority of the cases sent to the DCI lab. Of the 47 exhibits submitted to the lab in the first third of 2015, seven were from Johnson County and eight were from Linn County. Collectively, they account for nearly a third of all heroin cases submitted to the lab this year. \n \n Scott County leads the state with 16 submitted cases through the first four months of the year. \n \n Not only is heroin becoming increasingly common, but authorities warn that it's becoming deadlier, thanks to the presence of a synthetic opioid with 80 times the potency of heroin. \n \n And one Iowa Division of Narcotics Enforcement agent warns that heroin shows no sign of slowing down in Iowa. \n \n \u201cI think it's going to be on the upswing,\u201d DNE special agent-in-charge Dan Stepleton said. \u201cI think it's going to get worse and worse.\u201d \n \n Metro hubs \n \n Heroin is a highly addictive opioid produced from opium poppy. Usually injected by the user, heroin also can be smoked and is a powerful painkiller. It is similar to fellow opioid morphine, but 10 times as powerful. \n \n The heroin found in Iowa is produced by Mexican cartels and distributed through metropolitan hubs, such as Chicago, which helps to explain why Scott, Linn and Johnson counties in Eastern Iowa see more heroin cases than the more populous Polk County. \n \n \u201cBecause you have a predominant heroin source of Chicago and those are the closest three counties to Chicago in Iowa and they're metropolitan counties,\u201d Stepleton explained. \n \n Stepleton said heroin usually is distributed by gang members with Chicago affiliations. Criminal investigations often begin with an overdose death, he explained. \n \n \u201cUnfortunately it's usually already a done deal when we get involved,\u201d said Stepleton, who covers a 24-county swath of Eastern Iowa. \u201cWe are working toward the source of supply and not just waiting for an overdose to happen. We're trying to avert those as much as possible.\u201d \n \n According to a study released by the Centers for Disease Control last month, heroin use is rising across all demographics, with women and 18-to-25-year-olds seeing the biggest increases in recent years. Experts point to the rise of prescription drug abuse, especially among young people. \n \n \u201cWhat we're seeing is young people \u2014 high school and college age \u2014 will get addicted to Vicodin, oxycotin,\u201d Stepleton said. \u201cWhen they run out of the prescriptions, they'll resort to heroin because it's 10 times the potency of that drug. Unfortunately you're already hooked at that point. \n \n Related story: \n \n Change in law makes heroin death convictions more difficult to prosecute \n \n \u201cIt doesn't take long to make the switch from oxycotin to heroin, which in essence is going to make you a lifelong addict.\u201d \n \n Heroin is not a high-volume drug \u2014 it lags far behind more common illegal substances in Iowa such as marijuana and methamphetamine \u2014 and it's highly expensive. One ounce of heroin is a \u201chuge amount,\u201d Stepleton said, and most dealers work in shipments of 10 to 50 grams. \n \n Heroin is purchased for about $200 to $250 per gram and is usually sold for about $50 for a 10th of a gram. \n \n \u201cIt's a very expensive habit,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's why most of your heroin users have to be dealers. You just can't afford to get the drug.\u201d \n \n Because of its expensive and addictive nature, heroin abuse often is associated with property crimes such as thefts and burglaries. \n \n \u201cAddicts will do what they need to do to obtain the next fix,\u201d Jerman said. \n \n Lethal \n \n While there is no definitive ranking in Iowa on the most lethal drugs, heroin probably would be near the top of the list in terms of deaths with respect to the number of actual users, according to one state official. \n \n \u201cIt would appear that heroin is more lethal than many other substances,\u201d said Dale Woolery, associate director for the Governor's Office of Drug Control Policy. \n \n Woolery said it appears that a greater proportion of heroin users experience overdoses than users of more common drugs in Iowa, such as methamphetamine. \n \n \u201cThere are a lot of Iowans that have a strong appetite for methamphetamine,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it's rare, if it ever occurs ... that you hear of a methamphetamine-overdose death. I think it does occur, but I'm talking very few.\u201d \n \n Heroin typically is sold at a purity of three percent to five percent, Stepleton said. \n \n \u201cAfter that, it gets very, very lethal,\u201d he said. \n \n However, it's not an exact science and some dealers might not be as careful about diluting their drugs. \n \n \u201cThere's no FDA involved in this,\u201d Stepleton said. \u201cHe might dilute it down to 7 to 8 percent ... Taking it at 3 percent and taking it at 8 percent is a big freaking difference.\u201d \n \n Heroin is becoming even more lethal with the introduction of a drug called fentanyl. A synthetic opioid painkiller, fentanyl is 80 times as potent as heroin and a single piece of pure fentanyl the size of the grain of salt can kill a fully grown man. \n \n \u201cNow they're lacing heroin with fentanyl,\u201d Stepleton said. \u201cNow you have two drugs together and one is very much more powerful than the other. If I'm taking the same drug dosage unit and it's laced with fentanyl, now I end up with really severe problems ... You don't have long for this world.\u201d \n \n Stepleton said fentanyl and fentanyl-laced heroin has hit the East Coast hard in recent years, resulting in 2,500 to 3,500 overdoses in major cities. And it's making its way to Iowa. \n \n Bruce Reeve, administrator for the DCI crime lab, said technicians have been seeing fentanyl in the form of patches prescribed for chronic pain relief for years. But more recently they are seeing heroin laced with fentanyl. \n \n In January, the lab examined one case of heroin mixed with fentanyl. In April, there were three more. In May, half of the labs 10 heroin cases had samples cut with fentanyl. \n \n \u201cI think we're starting to see that a lot more in Iowa,\u201d Reeve said. \u201cIt's a trend that's alarming. Fentanyl is a dangerous drug if it's not handled right.\u201d \n \n Stepleton puts it more bluntly. \n \n \u201cI think it's going to be an extreme problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI can't stress that enough. There is no FDA in illicit drug distribution. It's a crapshoot on what you're going to be buying and putting in your body. ... It's like putting a loaded gun in your hand and spinning the chamber every time.\u201d \n \n In July, the Cedar Rapids Police Department announced it had received federal funding that would allow it to hire another officer. Having that additional officer will allow the department to place a seasoned professional with the Eastern Iowa Prevention, Treatment and Prosecution Initiative. The officer will emphasize heroin-prevention efforts while also working on the investigation and prosecution of heroin-related crimes. \n \n \u201cFrom decades ago, (heroin) seemed to be confined to different areas,\u201d Jerman said. \u201cNow we see there are no boundaries ... It's making its way into all segments of society. \n \n \u201cWhether it's lower middle, upper middle or the upper class, that's what we're seeing.\u201d \n \n Change in law makes heroin death convictions more difficult to prosecute \n \n A grieving mother displayed a photo of her son in a casket during a February sentencing of a man who had sold her child heroin, saying it's all she has left to remember him. \n \n Stacy Iberg likely is one of many mothers over the past five years in Eastern Iowa who have either lost a child or had a child overdose on heroin. \n \n Her son, Dustin Legrand, died from a heroin overdose last year after Ramon Freeman, 35, of Chicago, sold to someone who provided the heroin to Legrand. Freeman is now serving 30 years in federal prison. \n \n Federal prosecutors say Freeman is only one of 75 people charged in U.S. District Court in the past five years for distribution of heroin, and 38 of those have been in Linn County. From 2011 to 2015, 14 defendants in the Northern District have been charged in cases involving heroin deaths and six have been charged with bodily injury that resulted from heroin overdoses. \n \n But prosecuting these dealers has become more difficult after a 2014 U.S. Supreme Court decision involving an Iowa case in the Southern District, he said. \n \n That case set a higher standard for prosecutors to meet in distribution cases involving death, Assistant U.S. Attorney Dan Chatham said. There must be sufficient evidence the heroin is what caused the death, according to the law. \n \n Prosecutors previously only had to prove the heroin was a \u201ccontributing cause.\u201d In many of these cases, users may take other drugs along with the heroin. \n \n In an overdose causing bodily injury, Chatham said, there has to be evidence that the user was at high risk to die without medical intervention. \n \n Some cases haven't been able to meet that standard to convict for a heroin death, but Chatham and Patrick Reinert, also an assistant U.S. attorney, said they can argue in sentencing for more time based on other factors, such as previous convictions, purity of heroin or how close the dealer is to the main source. \n \n In the sentencing for Freeman in February, Chatham argued for more prison time based on the purity \u2014 in that case, 68 to 73 percent \u2014 of heroin he was selling, and Freeman's position in the chain of distribution. Dealers with higher purity levels typically are closer to the main source, he said. \n \n Chatham said the overdoses usually occur because the purity is so much higher than what the user is used to. In the past, the heroin might have been cut with another substance, so the dealers could have more product and make more money. \n \n Chatham said there also are cases in the district where users have overdosed because it's mixed with another drug such as fentanyl, used to treat severe pain and often used after surgery. \n \n There were two defendants indicted in June from Cedar Rapids for distribution of heroin/fentanyl and conspiracy to distribute heroin/fentanyl that resulted in bodily injury. ||||| Related video from New Jersey 101.5: \n \n This week, we're taking a special look at heroin's increasing grip on the Garden State. \n \n On Thursday, we'll conduct a special town hall \u2014 including a live chat where you can get your questions about addiction and treatment answered by New Jersey experts. It starts at 7 p.m. on NJ1015.com . \n \n Authorities tell us New Jersey's heroin epidemic isn't letting up \u2014 even with powerful new tools like the antidote Narcan to battle overdose deaths . \n \n The numbers back them up. Heroin use is spiking throughout the state \u2014 and it's making its way into the suburbs, as once-sleepy towns find themselves hotbeds of drug activity. \n \n Here's a look at the statistics : \n \n 781 \n \n It's a troubling number that just keeps on rising. In 2014, there were 781 heroin-related overdose deaths in New Jersey, according to data by the state Department of Criminal Justice. That's more than twice as many as in 2010. \n \n A report last year by New Jersey Advance Media notes that the per-capita rate of 8.3 heroin-related deaths per 100,000 people is more than triple the national rate reported by the Centers for Disease Control. In addition, heroin \"now eclipses homicide, suicide, car accidents and AIDS as a cause of death in the state,\" according to the report. \n \n For years, New Jersey's heroin death toll stayed comparatively stable, hovering in the mid-300s to mid-400s, and even getting as low as 306 in 2010. But it's been steadily increasing ever since then. \n \n 28,332 \n \n According to a report released by the Department of Human Services Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services last year , in 2014, 28,332 people were admitted into substance abuse treatment programs with heroin or another opiate listed as the individual's primary drug. That's nearly half of the 64,766 people entering treatment programs for substances overall in New Jersey. \n \n Both figures are down from 2013, when 72,864 entered substance treatment, 32,607 for heroin or other opiates. \n \n 3,688 \n \n Of those seeking treatment for heroin or opiates, the most were in Ocean County. The 3,688 admitted for treatment in Ocean accounted for 13 percent of all those admitted through the state, even though Ocean only accounts for about 6.5 percent of the total state population. \n \n But when the figures are broken down per 100,000 people, Cape May County leads the state for those entering treatment \u2014 at 1,138 (because of a statistical quirk, the per-capita number is greater than the raw number in Cape May; there are slightly less than 100,000 people in the county). Click on your county in the interactive map below to see how your county fares. Darker shades mean higher incidences of heroin and opiate treatment. \n \n 1,176 \n \n In 2014, 1,176 people in Newark sought treatment for heroin addiction \u2014 more than in any other municipality \u2014 according to a breakdown of the state treatment report by Patch.com . While the top cities for heroin use were urban centers \u2014 Paterson, Jersey City, Atlantic City and Camden round out the top 5 \u2014 there are several suburban communities among the top 20. Toms River was in sixth place, with 436 reported admissions, and Brick in seventh with 426. \n \n Central Jersey communities of Middletown and Lacey are on the list, as are Millville and Lower Township in South Jersey. Patch notes Bloomfield, \"long considered one of the safest neighborhood communities in Essex County,\" made its yearly analysis of the data for the first time, in 20th place \n \n 16.1% \n \n A 2011 state breakdown found more non-Hispanic white people , per capita, dying from drug use than blacks or Hispanics. According to the report, 16.1 per 100,000 white people died of drug-related causes \u2014 compared with 9.8 for black people and 5.1 for Hispanic people. \n \n That wasn't always the case \u2014 in 2000, more blacks died of drugs per capita (14.5 per 100,000 than whites (10). But drug deaths among whites have been steadily increasing, and blacks steadily decreasing \u2014 2007 was the last time black deaths from drug-related causes outpaced white deaths. \n \n 1,000 \n \n Nalaxone, an opiate antidote marketed under the name Narcan, was deployed more than 1,000 times in 2014, according to Gov. Chris Christie's office . \n \n Ocean County Prosecutor Joe Coronato told New Jersey 101.5 that it's been a help in his county \u2014 in 2013 there were 112 heroin deaths in Ocean County, and that number dropped to 101 in 2014. But he stressed it's a \"temporary save,\" saying \"there\u2019s been several individuals that we\u2019ve sprayed two or three times already,\u201d he said. But sometimes by the third time they\u2019ve not survived, they\u2019ve died. That\u2019s not truly addressing the problem. The problem is the addiction.\u201d \n \n 2% \n \n The 2013 New Jersey Student Health Survey (the most recent available) found that 2 percent of high school students had used heroin at some point in their lifetimes. That's about half as many as in 2001, though the figure's held steady for several years. \n \n Also according to the survey: \n \n \u2022 7 percent had used Ecstasy; \n \n \u2022 6 percent had used hallucinogens; \n \n \u2022 5 percent had used cocaine; \n \n \u2022 3 percent had used methamphetamines; \n \n \u2022 2 percent had used a needle to inject an illegal drug. \n \n 15% \n \n The 2013 New Jersey Student Health Survey also found 15 of students had attended school under the influence of drugs or alcohol during the previous 12 months. \n \n \u2014 Note: This is an update of a report first run in the summer of 2015. \n \n Related video from New Jersey 101.5: ||||| A view of Washington, Pa. Last week, Washington County recorded 16 overdoses in 24 hours and 25 over two days. Three people died. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post) \n \n The first call came at 7:33 p.m. last Sunday: Two people had overdosed on heroin in a home just a few hundred yards from the station where firefighters were awaiting their nightly round of drug emergencies. \n \n Six minutes later, there was another. A 50-year-old man had been found in his bedroom, blue from lack of oxygen, empty bags of heroin by his body. \n \n At 8:11, a third call. Then another, and another, and another and another. \n \n By 8:42 \u2014 69 minutes after the first report \u2014 a county of slightly more than 200,000 people had recorded eight overdoses, all believed to be caused by heroin. There would be a total of 16 overdoses in 24 hours and 25 over two days. Three people died. Many of the others were saved by a recent decision to equip every first responder with the fast-acting antidote naloxone. \n \n The toll wasn\u2019t from a supply of heroin that had been poisoned on its journey from South America to southwestern Pennsylvania. Nor was there an isolated party where careless junkies miscalculated the amount of heroin they could handle. Last week was simply an extreme example of what communities in parts of the country are enduring as the heroin epidemic rages on. \n \n Valerie Mack, left, is comforted by family friend Carla Stormy Efaw in Washington, Pa. Mack lost her brother, Sammy Mack, to a heroin overdose. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post) \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely insane. This is nuts,\u201d said District Attorney Eugene A. Vittone, a former paramedic who is trying to hold back the tide of drugs washing across Washington County, a Rust Belt community 30 miles south of Pittsburgh. On any day, Vittone said, the county averages five to eight overdoses, almost all from heroin. More are recorded each day in towns just over the county line. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s been a progressive increase in overdoses the last two years, and it just went out of control,\u201d added Rick Gluth, supervising detective on Vittone\u2019s drug task force. \u201cI\u2019ve been a police officer for 27 years and worked narcotics for the last 15, and this is the worst. I\u2019d be glad to have the crack epidemic back.\u201d \n \n [Cheap fix: Heroin\u2019s resurgence. \u2018And then he decided not to be\u2019] \n \n The United States averages 110 overdose deaths from legal and illegal drugs every day. The heroin death toll has quadrupled in the decade that ended in 2013, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. By all accounts, it has only grown worse since. In Washington County, there have been more than 50 fatal overdoses this year. \n \n The national drug-death total, larger than that from auto accidents, is disproportionately concentrated in the Rust Belt, the Great Lakes region and the Northeast. \n \n \u201cThere is a growing sense of community outrage that we can\u2019t accept this like we are accepting it,\u201d said David J. Hickton, U.S. attorney for western Pennsylvania and co-chair of the National Heroin Task Force established by the Justice Department in April. \u201cWe just can\u2019t go on like this.\u201d \n \n In this working-class community near the Monongahela River, where drilling for gas deposits has begun to stoke an economic revival, there is little sign that anything will change soon. \n \n This man who only wishes to be identified as Sonny, learned that his daughter had a heroin overdose at a nearby Walgreens store in Washington, Penn. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post) \n \n \u201cI\u2019m destroyed. I\u2019m totally destroyed,\u201d Valerie Mack said Thursday on the front porch of the home she shared with her brother and several other people on a modest block here. \n \n Her brother, Sammy Mack, the second overdose victim in the Sunday night skein, was found dead in his bedroom, curled in a fetal position. Near his body were \u201cstamp bags\u201d of heroin \u2014 small paper packets that most closely resemble chewing gum wrappers. They bore the supplier\u2019s brand, \u201cMADE IN COLOMBIA.\u201d \n \n The label is one of two flooding the area, Gluth said. The other is stamped \u201cBLACK JACK.\u201d Authorities are still investigating but believe both types of heroin are laced with fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opiate that increases the drug\u2019s potency and may have contributed to the rash of overdoses. \n \n Sammy Mack had long had problems with alcohol and was not unknown to law enforcement authorities. But as so many others have, his sister said, he turned to heroin after treatment with narcotic painkillers prescribed for an ankle injury he suffered a few months ago. Mack\u2019s divorce was recently finalized, she said. His four children are living with his ex-wife not far away. \n \n [When life begins in rehab: A baby heals after a mother\u2019s heroin addiction] \n \n As he began to use heroin, Mack\u2019s habits and personality changed, she said. He became withdrawn, spending more time in his room. That Sunday, she was fixing him a chef\u2019s salad and became suspicious when he didn\u2019t respond to her calls. She tried to push open his bedroom door but couldn\u2019t. A neighbor finally forced his way in. \n \n Mack\u2019s prized possession, a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, still sits in the home\u2019s back yard. He had promised it to his 14-year-old son upon his high school graduation. \u201cI\u2019ll just have to follow through,\u201d Valerie Mack said. \n \n With so much awry in Sammy Mack\u2019s life, his sister said, \u201cMaybe the Lord intervened and decided just to take him.\u201d \n \n Jessica Neal, 26, another of last week\u2019s overdoses, is still alive after a close call. She was found unconscious in a bathroom at a local Walgreen\u2019s on Monday, her 2-year-old strapped in a stroller in the stall with her. She was revived with naloxone. \n \n Her father, Sonny, who has a different last name that he requested not be used to protect his privacy, said he threatened to have her committed to the psychiatric unit of the local hospital that same day after Neal spoke of committing suicide. Instead, she agreed to sign herself in. She was released Friday and headed to jail. The child is in her father\u2019s care, he said. \n \n \u201cShe doesn\u2019t need jail,\u201d Sonny said outside the home where the two lived with Sonny\u2019s wife, who suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), until last week. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t out stealing or doing crimes. What she needs is help. She needs to be in rehab. And after rehab, she needs to be in a halfway house.\u201d \n \n Nationally, there are only a small fraction of the inpatient drug rehab beds needed for addicts, but Hickton, in an increasingly common stance for prosecutors, has agreed that users need help more than they deserve incarceration. Even as he has stepped up prosecution of dealers, he is taking a multifaceted approach to the current problem. \n \n \u201cIf they\u2019re using and trafficking, I prosecute them,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re just using, they need help.\u201d \n \n Hickton promises to bring homicide charges against any seller he can link to a death. But that is easier said than done. There are no open-air drug markets in this epidemic like the ones that captured public\u2019s attention during drug outbreaks of past decades. Much of the commerce is conducted on cellphones and by word of mouth. \n \n With many more middle-class people addicted via prescription opioids this time around, heroin is bought and sold in bars, nightclubs, homes and more unlikely places, said Neil Capretto, an addiction psychiatrist and medical director of Gateway Rehabilitation Center, which has 20 locations in the Pittsburgh area. \n \n Gluth said he has undercover detectives all over the streets making buys, painstakingly working their way up the chain in search of bigger dealers. \n \n He believes the latest load of heroin came from New Jersey, but Washington County\u2019s location makes it particularly vulnerable to drug traffic. Not far from the Ohio and West Virginia borders, it sits at the intersection of Interstates 70 and 79, east-west and north-south conduits for drugs and everything else. Vittone said the county receives drugs from New York, Newark, Washington, Chicago, Detroit and elsewhere. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re kind of like ground zero,\u201d he said. \n \n On the streets here, prescription drugs are selling for about $1 per milligram, or $20 for a single dose. Heroin is much cheaper, at about $8 a stamp bag, Gluth said. It is also much more potent than the heroin of previous eras, Capretto said. Users often start with a single bag, but as their resistance grows, they need increasing amounts. \n \n All of which signals more overdoses and deaths, at least until authorities can find ways to stem the demand and the supply. \n \n \u201cIf we had a serial killer killing one-tenth as many [people], we\u2019d have the National Guard here,\u201d Capretto said. \u201cWe\u2019d have CNN here every night.\u201d ||||| Ravages Of Heroin Addiction Haunt Friends, Families And Whole Towns \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Maddie McGarvey for NPR Maddie McGarvey for NPR \n \n Marion, Ohio, just north of Columbus, used to be an idyllic place to grow up. \n \n Kelly Clixby and Beth Carey remember what it was like a generation ago, when they were young. \n \n \"I lived across the street from one of the big parks here,\" Clixby says. \"We would rip n' run all day and all night and come in when the street lights were on.\" \n \n \"It was just a nice place to live,\" Carey says. \n \n Today, Marion is different.

Heroin is cheap, abundant and accessible, and communities across the nation, from big cities to small rural towns, are struggling with the consequences. \n \n In Marion, Ohio \u2014 once a thriving steel town \u2014 the trouble arrived around 2007, when the police started seeing balloons of heroin during routine traffic stops. \n \n Since then, heroin has changed many lives in Marion. It took Chrystina Carey's. \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Maddie McGarvey for NPR Maddie McGarvey for NPR \n \n Beth Carey had started worrying about her sister when they were in their early 20s. At that point, Chrystina was hanging around a different crowd than her twin, taking ecstasy while working as a dietary manager. \n \n \"She was on call all the time,\" Beth Carey says. \"She said, about the ecstasy ... she was taking it to stay up when we would go out on the weekends.\" \n \n At some point, Chrystina switched from ecstasy to the painkiller OxyContin \u2014 and then, eventually, to heroin. \n \n \"She OD'd and went to the hospital three times,\" Beth Carey says. \"Out of the six or seven years [she was on heroin], she was probably incarcerated a good two, 2 1/2 years. \n \n \"But still continued to use drugs.\" \n \n The last time Chrystina Carey got out of prison, she went to stay at an addiction recovery house in the next town over. \n \n Kelly Clixby was living there, too, grappling with an addiction that began with prescribed painkillers and led to heroin. She knew Chrystina well. \n \n \"That was my best friend,\" she says. \n \n Clixby remembers the night before Chrystina Carey died. She was heading out with someone known to be wrapped up in drugs and Kelly was worried. \n \n \"I said, 'If you leave with that person, you're probably going to die tonight.' And I was being sarcastic ... by no means did I mean it. \n \n \"And she left. And at 8 o'clock the next morning I woke up to a phone call that she had died. She had overdosed, after seven months of sobriety.\" \n \n Witnessing the death of her friend had a profound impact on Clixby's own sobriety. \n \n \"It terrified me,\" she says. \"For a long time after that I stayed clean just ... so I wouldn't disrespect her, or so her death wouldn't be in vain.\" \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Maddie McGarvey for NPR Maddie McGarvey for NPR \n \n 'Burnt Every Bridge They've Ever Had' \n \n Marion Police Chief Bill Collins has witnessed many overdoses like the one that killed Chrystina Carey. Back in May of this year, he said his team was responding to as many as two or three in a single hour. \n \n \"You walk in and you know, you see somebody that's blue. I mean, to you they appear to be dead,\" he says. Then the officers would administer a drug called Narcan. \n \n \"It's like a miracle drug,\" Collins says. \"Within 30 seconds they snap out of it. They wake up. They look at you like they don't know what happened.\" \n \n Collins would tell survivors how lucky they were to be alive, how close they came to death. \n \n \"We would get called to the same house and people had just seen somebody overdose and they would still do it,\" he says. \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Maddie McGarvey for NPR Maddie McGarvey for NPR \n \n Collins remembers several years ago when all he had to worry about in Marion was crack cocaine. \n \n And at least crack addicts, he says, could somehow hold a life together. \n \n It's a different story with heroin users, he says. \n \n \"These people are not able to hold a job,\" he says. \"They steal their family blind to the point where the family just pretty much disowns them. \n \n \"It doesn't take long for you to end up seeing a heroin addict that has burnt every bridge they've ever had.\" \n \n The drug is the root cause for many of the other problems his department faces, he says. \n \n \"All of the property crimes we have \u2014 the shoplifting, the thefts, the robberies \u2014 all go back to one thing, and that's heroin.\" \n \n Opiate Blockers Offer Some Aid \n \n \n \n Narcan can save the lives of heroin users on the brink of death, but another drug, Vivitrol, helps addicts avoid getting there in the first place. \n \n Vivitrol is a big reason Marion has been able to get some sort of grip on its heroin epidemic. \n \n The drug is an extended-release opiate blocker. Kelly Clixby, Chrystina Carey's friend and a recovering heroin addict, explains how it works. \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Maddie McGarvey for NPR Maddie McGarvey for NPR \n \n \"I get a shot every four weeks and what it does is it sits on the opioid receptors in the brain,\" she says. \"And if I were to use heroin or an opiate, it wouldn't be able to attach to that receptor, so I wouldn't get high \u2014 so it's basically a waste of time.\" \n \n It's a powerful tool for helping addicts keep from relapsing, but Clixby is clear about its limits. \n \n \"A lot of people think it's a cure-all,\" Clixby says. \"It's not.\" \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Maddie McGarvey for NPR Maddie McGarvey for NPR \n \n And, because Vivitrol only blocks the effects of opiates like heroin, Collins says addicts dead set on getting high are looking elsewhere. \n \n \"We've seen a pretty big increase back into the crack cocaine market, because they can be on probation and be on the Vivitrol shot and still use crack cocaine and get high,\" he says. \n \n \"So they're still feeding their addiction: They've just switched to something different again.\" \n \n Police, Recovering Addicts And Families Fight Onward \n \n It's been almost eight years since heroin showed up in Marion, Ohio. Since then, Chief Collins says public awareness campaigns have helped with the problem, and more funding for drugs like Narcan and Vivitrol has saved lives. A couple of months ago his department brought down a major drug dealer. \n \n They're not the aunt or uncle or daughter or son or sister that you used to know. They're a shell of a person that used to be great. \n \n \"You feel like you're in the ocean without a life jacket,\" he says. \"And I at least feel like I have a life jacket on now.\" \n \n After years of fighting her own heroin addiction, Kelly Clixby's life is on more stable footing. She's got her own apartment. She's regained custody of one of her five kids and she is working on her second marriage, although her husband is still battling his own addiction. \n \n \"I've really learned just to stay on my track and just keep trudging forward despite what he's doing,\" she says. \"If he uses, I can't, no matter what.\" \n \n And Beth Carey, for her part, thinks about her twin sister every day. \n \n Chrystina Carey left behind two daughters. One is now 15 years old and lives with Beth's grandmother. Beth is raising the younger girl \u2014 Jazlen, age 3. \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Maddie McGarvey for NPR Maddie McGarvey for NPR \n \n She calls Beth Carey \"Mommy.\" \n \n \"When I first got her ... I was letting her call me Aunt Beth,\" Carey says. \"And then after a while, she was going to daycare, and she would hear other people cry out for mommy. So she started calling everyone mommy, cause she didn't understand what that meant. \n \n \"And I knew that she needed to associate that word with someone.\" \n \n Beth Carey is trying to look forward, but it's hard when so many other families in her community are also suffering the effects of heroin. Sometimes loved ones die, like her sister, and other times they just slip away. \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Maddie McGarvey for NPR Maddie McGarvey for NPR \n \n \"They're just zombies at this point.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The Washington Post takes a look at the country's surging heroin epidemic by zeroing in on Pennsylvania\u2019s Washington County, a place one local detective refers to as \"ground zero\" for heroin in the area. Last Sunday, in less than 70 minutes, eight heroin overdoses were recorded in the county of about 200,000 people. By a day later, that number had jumped to 16; by two days later, 25\u2014three of which were fatal. As the Post notes, this period of time wasn't an isolated case but rather \"an extreme example of what communities in parts of the country are enduring.\" In a Florida community earlier this month, 11 people overdosed on heroin in a 24-hour span, WKMG reported; this year, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, had seen 44 heroin overdoses by June 5, the Gazette reported; New Jersey saw 781 overdose deaths related to heroin last year, 101.5 reported. Just yesterday, NPR ran a story on Marion, Ohio, a small town whose police chief says that his team sometimes responds to as many as three overdoses in just one hour. One of the reasons heroin is booming: It's cheap\u2014cheaper than the prescription drugs that, for some, start them down the road of addiction. And one of the reasons there are so many overdoses? Nowadays, the drug is even more potent. The US attorney for western Pennsylvania is one of a growing number of prosecutors who aren't interested in jailing users, the Post reports: \"If they're using and trafficking, I prosecute them. If they\u2019re just using, they need help,\" he says. But finding dealers\u2014including any linked to fatal overdoses, who will be charged with homicide\u2014is no easy task, as these days drugs are sold via cellphone or even, with more middle-class people addicted now, in unlikely locations like homes.

    "document": "A flying snake flattens out into a weird flying-saucer shape in order to get some extra airtime, new research suggests. \n \n The findings, published today (Jan. 29) in The Journal of Experimental Biology, show that the Southeast Asian snake's flattened, UFO-like cross-section gives it the right aerodynamic properties for gliding. \n \n \"The shape is unusual,\" said study co-author Jake Socha, a biomechanics researcher at Virginia Tech. \"You never find this kind of shape in any other animal flyer; you don't find it in engineered flyers. We didn't know if that was a good shape to have.\" [See Images of the Flying Snake] \n \n Gliding animals \n \n The weird flying snake, Chrysopelea paradisi, curls its tail around a tree branch more than 50 feet (15 meters) above the ground before launching upward, curling its body and gliding to the next tree limb. \n \n While birds, and even humans using glider wings, are much better at their airborne maneuvers, the snake's performance compares favorably to that of other gliding animals, such as flying squirrels, lizards and even ants, Socha said. \n \n Researchers already knew that the snakes curved around, splayed out their ribs to flatten their bodies and undulated as they were airborne \u2014 but they didn't know why. \n \n \"It looks like it's swimming in the air,\" Socha told LiveScience. \n \n No snake-shaped planes \n \n To answer one part of the puzzle, the team created physical models of the cross-section and tested them in a water tunnel, which, if set up properly, can have the same flow characteristics as air, Socha said. \n \n It turned out that the flying saucer cross-section was a surprisingly good shape to take \u2014 much better than the cylindrical shape the snake would have if it didn't compress itself. \n \n Compared to a more familiar flying shape, such as an airplane wing scaled down to snake size, \"you'd find the snake is actually comparable,\" Socha said. \n \n \"The animal has figured out a solution to an engineering problem that we didn't even know we had,\" Socha said. \n \n But don't expect to board a 747 with flying-snake-shaped wings anytime soon, as the shape wouldn't be nearly as aerodynamically effective at a plane's size and speed, Socha said. \n \n Now, the team has to solve another mystery: why the snake undulates once or twice every second while gliding, Socha said. \n \n Follow Tia Ghose on Twitter and Google+. Follow LiveScience @livescience, Facebook & Google+. Original article on LiveScience. ||||| By Charles Q. Choi \n \n Snakes don\u2019t need to be on a plane to fly: Five species of the gliding reptiles can soar as far as 100 feet (30 meters) in the tropical rain forests of Southeast Asia. \n \n Now scientists have discovered the secret behind how these snakes stay airborne\u2014they twist their bodies into an S shape that resembles an alien\u2019s flying saucer from the side. \n \n Scientists already knew that flying snakes climb up trees by using ridges on their belly scales to help grip bark as they slither upward, and that when the animals glide downward, they undulate from side to side. (Related: \u201cHow Snakes Can \u2018Fly.\u2019\u201d) \n \n These movements\u2014done by flexing the ribs\u2014transform the serpent\u2019s body into a totally aerodynamic surface, according to biomechanist Jake Socha, of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg, and his colleagues. \n \n As frightening as the idea of a 4-foot (1.2-meter) flying snake might be to some, these mildly venomous reptiles are harmful only to small prey. \n \n Scientists don\u2019t know how often or exactly why flying snakes fly, but it\u2019s likely they use their aerobatics to escape predators, to move from tree to tree without having to descend to the forest floor, and possibly even to hunt prey. \n \n Watch a video of a flying snake. \n \n \n \n Clues From 3-D Printing \n \n To learn more about the aerodynamic forces the snakes generate, Socha and his colleagues used a 3-D printer, which works by depositing layers on top of layers to create 3-D objects. (Related: \u201cImproving 3-D Printing by Copying Nature.\u201d) \n \n The researchers printed a 3-D rod with a UFO-like cross section that mimicked the body of the paradise tree snake (Chrysopelea paradisi), the most proficient snake glider. The team then placed the rod within a tank of water that flowed over it, re-creating the air conditions the reptiles experience as they glide through the forest. \n \n The scientists tilted the rod at various angles as water flowed over it at different speeds, and measured how the current moved the rod up or down. \n \n The results, published January 29 in the Journal of Experimental Biology, showed that at most angles, the snake model\u2019s undulating shape generated enough lift to account for the animal\u2019s gliding ability. (See more snake pictures.) \n \n The researchers added that real flying snakes appear to glide even better than their findings from the 3-D printed model would suggest. \n \n They are now investigating what else these reptiles might do to boost their aerial performances. As it is, these serpents remain somewhat Unexplained Flying Ophidians. \n \n Follow Charles Q. Choi on Twitter and Google+.",

Until now, scientists didn't know how they managed it, but now they think they do: As the snakes jump, they flatten out their ribs and contort themselves into an S-shape that sorta kinda resembles a flying saucer, LiveScience reports. \"You never find this kind of shape in any other animal flyer; you don't find it in engineered flyers,\" says one study co-author. \"We didn't know if that was a good shape to have.\" The snake's body develops a curve a little like an airplane wing, the BBC explains, which coupled with its undulating movements generates lift. Researchers hit on the discovery using 3D-printed models in tanks of water, National Geographic reports. But observations of real snakes indicate that they're even better gliders than the model suggested, meaning some aspect of their prowess remains unexplained.

She thought it was a \u201cmessage to the Russians,\u201d she said to laughs. \n \n She took other hits at Trump, too, calling him a \u201cvery impulsive, reactive personality\u201d in response to an audience question and describing his reported plan to withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement as \u201ctotally incomprehensible\u201d because of the economic opportunity she said it presents. \n \n Clinton also commented on the state of the Democratic Party, declining to name possible 2020 presidential candidates but calling on people to focus on coming gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia, as well as the 2018 midterms. Flipping the House is \u201ccertainly realistic\u201d and should be a goal for Democrats, she said, but acknowledged the need to get organized enough to do it. \n \n When asked directly by Swisher, Clinton said she is not running for office again. But she also said she has no intention of vacating the public stage, as some of her critics, and some Democrats, want her to do. \n \n \u201cI'm not going anywhere,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI have a big stake in what happened in this country.

They were connected to the bots that are just out of control.\u201d \n \n It\u2019s not actually clear that \u201cwe now know\u201d any of this. There was a lot of fake news swirling around Facebook in the closing weeks of the campaign, but I haven\u2019t seen any evidence that it was the \u201cvast majority.\u201d The claim that there were 1,000 Russian agents spreading fake news comes from a March statement by Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), but he described these as unconfirmed reports, not proven facts. \n \n Clinton also notes that WikiLeaks released Clinton adviser John Podesta\u2019s stolen emails \u2014 widely believed to have come from Russian hackers \u2014 within hours of the release of Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cgrab \u2019em by the pussy\u201d Access Hollywood tape. \n \n Clinton speculated that the Trump campaign may have coordinated with the Russians to make sure the leaked information had maximum impact, arguing that it would have taken guidance from domestic political operatives to make sure the Russians released stolen documents at times when they would have the most effect. \n \n Sexism \n \n Clinton rejected the suggestion that giving six-figure speeches to Goldman Sachs and other special interest groups had hurt her candidacy. \n \n She insinuated that the issue was tailored unfairly around gender: \"Men got paid for the speeches they made, and I got paid for the speeches I made. It was used, I thought it was unfairly used, and all of that, but it was part of the background music.\" \n \n She also downplayed the decision in general: \n \n \u201cI gave speeches to many, many groups,\u201d she said. \u201cI never thought that anybody would throw out my entire career of standing up and speaking out and voting against and voting in favor of what I thought were good policies because I made a couple of speeches.\u201d \n \n The media \n \n Clinton blames the media for covering her email scandal \u2014 which she dubbed \u201cthe biggest nothingburger ever\u201d \u2014 \u201clike it was Pearl Harbor.\u201d \n \n She said she was hobbled by the sorry state of the Democratic Party at the time she won the nomination. \n \n \u201cI get the nomination, and I inherit nothing from the Democratic Party,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cIt was bankrupt. It was on the verge of insolvency. Its data was mediocre to poor, nonexistent, wrong. I had to inject money into the DNC to keep it going.\u201d \n \n Democrats, she said, \u201care not good historically at building institutions, and we've got to get a lot better.\u201d She added that \u201cthat includes content,\u201d arguing that the media had not done a good job of explaining how Barack Obama had saved the economy from a major depression in 2009. \n \n \u201cI also think I was the victim of a very broad assumption that we were going to win,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI was swimming against a historic tide.

One of them must have tracked the other down, and I think we all know which one. (Hint: It's the one with the \"I'm on a list\" mustache.) It's entirely possible that he moved to America in order to find her. Again, a girl he barely knew even when they were kids. And she's either OK with that, and therefore equally as messed up, or bound to find out eventually exactly what she agreed to spend the rest of her life with. There's a lesson here, parents: Don't make your kids think about Meat Loaf's penis. It'll fuck them up for life. \n \n \u2193 Continue Reading Below Advertisement \n \n Then there's Colin Firth's character, the lovelorn writer who retreats to the French countryside and ends up falling for the Portuguese maid he's hired even though they've never truly spoken, as she doesn't speak English and he doesn't speak Portuguese. People thought it was moving a little too fast when, by the end of the film, he's asked her to marry him in broken Portuguese. But guess what, bitches? They're still going strong! Not only did they get married, they have three beautiful children! Don't you see? By knowing the other person couldn't understand them, they could be truly honest, and that habit didn't go away after they started comprehending each other. Suck it, cynics! \n \n BBC \n \n Then this happened and my heart-boner audibly retreated right into my chest-sack: \n \n BBC \n \n *Play For Full Effect* \n \n \u2193 Continue Reading Below Advertisement \n \n Not because he doesn't look terribly happy about it, or because four kids in 13 years seems like a bit much, but because she says it in Portuguese and his response is, \"That's great, can we have rice with it this time? I'm tired of stir fry.\" I get it, it's supposed to be funny, but are you telling me he's had 13 years to learn her language and he's still no better than he was at the end of the first movie? She must know that, so why does she insist on speaking Portuguese to him when we know she was learning English, too? That seems kind of passive-aggressive, possibly resentful of his inconsideration. \n \n Or, maybe they both gave it a go for a few months and then realized that their relationship was better when they couldn't understand each other. Panicked when the bloom started to come off the rose, they silently agreed to stop trying, hoping to keep the spark alive through mutual incomprehension. Because if you don't understand what your partner is saying, they can be saying whatever you want them to. And they've kept that going for 13 years. Because love actually is more complicated than a slightly overlong Christmas movie, and that's kind of terrifying. \n \n But how great is Hugh Grant? Right?

The cast was there, everyone from Hugh Grant, Bill Nighy and Colin Firth to Keira Knightley, Rowan Atkinson, Liam Neeson and more. So you could applaud the logistics and goodwill of pulling it all together. \n \n However, it was all lousy jokes and texted-in performances and looked as though it had been cobbled together by fourth formers as an end-of-term project. Even at just 12 minutes, it felt far too long. \n \n Admittedly, I didn\u2019t like the original film. Watching it made me feel as if I was having cold, stale treacle poured over my head by a large mob of demented carollers. \n \n But I still rate Richard Curtis for Blackadder, and I love Comic Relief, and always donate. Maybe the failure of Red Nose Day Actually partly lay in the weight of expectation? Had they kept the venture a secret until, say, a couple of days before, perhaps there wouldn\u2019t have been such a build-up and viewers would have been more forgiving? \n \n As it is, I\u2019m glad that people donated. But I doubt that anyone laughed. ||||| Despite all the celeb cameos the charity update of Richard Curtis\u2019s romcom was bafflingly weak. But ultimately its job wasn\u2019t to get laughs - it was to help people \n \n The best will in the world is what we all have for Red Nose Day \u2014 and for Richard Curtis\u2019s monumental effort over decades in helping to make it a great national instutition. I\u2019m very happy to have got my debit card out on the night, like so many others. The convention is that you cheerfully overlook some of the gags that don\u2019t come off on account of the wacky gang-show spirit and live-TV hijinks and because it\u2019s all in a good cause. But the awful truth is that Red Nose Day Actually, the much-trumpeted special featurette update of Curtis\u2019s 2003 romcom box office smash, really was bafflingly weak. \n \n \n \n Behind the scenes of Comic Relief\u2019s Love Actually: Andrew Lincoln\u2019s creepy cards return Read more \n \n We knew in advance that Curtis had (understandably) decided not include the best bit from the original \u2014 Emma Thompson\u2019s agonised secret tears over her husband\u2019s infidelity \u2014 because the much-loved Alan Rickman, who played the part had passed away last year. But why should the script go out of its way to say that Joe, the long-suffering rock manager played by Gregor Fisher, and best friend of Bill Nighy\u2019s outrageously incorrect star Billy Mac, had died? Mr Fisher is very much still with us. It seemed a superfluous moment of contrived poignancy. \n \n We started with Andrew Lincoln showing up on Keira Knightley\u2019s doorstep with his famous cards, with Chiwetel Ejiofor watching telly. The gag was basically the same, only this time Kate Moss pitched up as his new bride, standing next to him with cards of her own. Nice enough cameo. \n \n Hugh Grant returned as the Prime Minister, who did his level best to rescue the situation by gamely reprising his silly dad-dancing routine down the No 10 staircase, falling over and spraining his arm. Incidentally, on the question of who has aged the best of the LA cast, that is definitely Martine McCutcheon playing his tea-lady-turned-wife. She genuinely doesn\u2019t look any different from 2003. As for Grant, he looks distinguished, soign\u00e9. He could play Edward VIII. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Hugh Grant during filming for Red Nose Day Actually. Photograph: Nick Briggs \n \n Grant\u2019s PM gave a press conference speech, with Robert Peston doing a cheeky walk-on and BBC Breakfast\u2019s Charlie Stayt contributing an enigmatically silent cameo. Here, expectations were very high. In the original movie, Hugh Grant\u2019s role was notable for a very feisty pro-British speech which proclaimed that we shouldn\u2019t just be America\u2019s poodle. Surely now was the time for some Trump material? No. Red Nose Day Actually steered clear of politics, except for saying how sad it was that Piers Morgan was still alive. \n \n We had Radio Watford\u2019s DJ, played by Marcus Brigstocke, on to interview the uproarious and incorrigible veteran singing sensation Billy Mac. The mere presence of Bill Nighy is enough to cheer any film up, and Nighy brought his languorous charisma to bear. He\u2019s always funny, and I liked the idea of Billy covering ZZ Top\u2019s Give Me All Your Lovin\u2019 with the word \u201clovin\u201d replaced by \u201cmoney\u201d. \n \n Colin Firth was seen at the wheel of his family car, with his Portuguese wife Lucia Moniz next to him, and the gag was that he was terrible at Portuguese and didn\u2019t understand when his wife told him she was pregnant again. Hmm. A lot Red Nose Day tolerance was needed to wave that joke through. \n \n Liam Neeson (who himself hardly seems to have aged a day) was emotionally reunited with his son, the love of whose life turned out not to have changed. A sweet enough moment. But the only person who came close to delivering some actual comedy was Rowan Atkinson, reprising his role as the smarmy shop assistant taking an inordinate amount of time packing a simple red nose. \n \n Red Nose Day Actually presumed a very great deal on the affectionate loyalty of the fans: I personally would have preferred a Red Nose update of Four Weddings or Notting Hill or The Tall Guy, the real Curtis gems. Perhaps there is something in the Red Nose Day atmosphere which actually militates against comedy \u2014 something in the fact that irony and cynicism have to be banished for the evening. Well, who cares? Even subjecting this well-intentioned squib to critical inspection seems obtuse. Red Nose Actually was not there to get laughs \u2014 it was there to get money to help people. And on that basis I am certain it was a great success. \n \n ||||| We\u2019ve been waiting thirteen years, but finally we got our sequel to Love Actually. \n \n Advertisement \n \n It might have been short, but it was a funny, poignant tribute to the much-loved Richard Curtis romcom. Here\u2019s what has happened to some our favourite characters in Red Nose Day Actually\u2026 \n \n Juliet, Peter and Mark (Keria Knightley, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Andrew Lincoln) \n \n Yep, those cue cards were back. As the doorbell rang again at Juliet and Peter\u2019s house, Mark was standing on the doorstep trying to insist he was a carol singer. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to believe that, it\u2019s March,\u201d said Juliet as Mark played Silent Night (did he not get this March memo at all?) on a totally retro iPod dock and asked what she thought of his facial fuzz. \n \n We found out that Juliet and Peter were still very happily married (awh) and that Mark hasn\u2019t done too badly himself. After saying he was going to marry a model, it turns out he did in the shape of Kate Moss. Mossy put in a nice cameo herself as she sidled up with her own cue cards and confirmed that no, she doesn\u2019t really like her husband\u2019s beard either. \n \n The Prime Minister and Natalie (Hugh Grant and Martine McCutcheon) \n \n It turns out that the PM had been re-elected into Downing Street. After five years out of office, he was voted back in. Jo Whiley dedicated Drake\u2019s Hotline Bling to him, prompting an altogether more sultry dance performance from the country\u2019s leader. \n \n There was a lot of shimmying as he recreated the moves from the video \u2013 well, until he fell down the stairs and hurt his arm. He is now married to Natalie and is still giving heart-warming and impassioned speeches during press conferences to the nation. What happened to Billy Bob Thornton\u2019s US President remains a mystery. \n \n Billy Mack, DJ Mikey and Joe (Bill Nighy, Marcus Brigstocke and Gregor Fisher) \n \n Thirteen years on and Mikey is still working at Radio Watford. And Billy Mack is still plugging cheap cash-in charity singles \u2013 this time a cover of ZZ Top\u2019s Give Me All Your Lovin\u2019, with the word Lovin\u2019 changed to Money. He\u2019s only doing this because his autobiography (which he hasn\u2019t actually read) called Macknificent is coming out and he needs the publicity. \n \n However there was some sad news. His manager Joe who had \u201ca big heart\u201d died from a big heart attack, leaving a big hole in Billy\u2019s life. \n \n Rufus (Rowan Atkinson) \n \n Rufus hasn\u2019t fared too well selling posh jewellery. Instead of still working in the luxury sector, he is now behind the counter at Sainsbury\u2019s flogging red noses to children for \u00a31. He is still taking his job very seriously and spending a long time gift-wrapping his noses. \n \n Tissue paper goes into the presentation box along with the nose which is then placed in \u201cso much more than just a bag\u201d alongside jelly beans, a bit of glitter and yoghurt-coated raisins as a queue forms across the carpark. \n \n Jamie and Aurelia (Colin Firth and Lucia Moniz) \n \n After proposing in the restaurant, Aurelia is now \u201cinhabit with me in England,\u201d as Jamie suggested all those years ago. The pair are now happily-married with three children, Jamie is still wearing turtle neck jumpers and his Portugese has come on leaps and bounds. \n \n It\u2019s still not perfect, though. When Aurelia tells him the news that she\u2019s pregnant for the fourth time, he replies that he wants rice with it because he\u2019s getting a bit tired of stir fry. Oh, Jamie! \n \n Daniel, Sam and Joanna (Liam Neeson, Thomas Brodie-Sangster and Olivia Olson) \n \n Daniel is still spending his days sitting on park benches looking melancholic, but his son Sam is now 26 years old and spending time in New York. He flew back to surprise him with news of his love life. \n \n Advertisement \n \n He is now dating Joanna \u2013 the girl he wanted for Christmas when he was 12 years old. They met up in New York and now she\u2019s in London to ask Daniel if she can marry Sam. He said he was thinking about it, but we never got a proper answer. We\u2019re taking it as a yes. ||||| This heavily hyped centrepiece of Comic Relief 2017 reunited stars from Richard Curtis\u2019s irresistibly schmaltzy Christmas 2003 romcom, notably Grant, Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, Bill Nighy and Keira Knightley. And notably not Martin Freeman (too busy \u2013 or perhaps too embarrassed about his nudity in the original), Kris Marshall (too cringe-worthy a character) or Emma Thompson, who demurred out of respect for her co-star Alan Rickman, who sadly died last year. \n \n This pacy sketch enabled us to see what happened to the characters after the credits rolled. It was packed with shot-for-shot nods and in-jokey callbacks to the notoriously polarising original. While Love Actually\u2019s storylines were neatly interwoven, this reprise revisited them each in turn but was no less grin-inducing for its structural clumsiness. ||||| When Love Actually premiered in 2003, the ensemble rom-com featured one very special supermodel cameo\u2014Claudia Schiffer\u2014as a potential love match for Liam Neeson. And when the long-awaited, sequel premiered on Friday, as part of Red Nose Day in the U.K., the 10-minute follow-up featured another surprise cameo from the catwalk. This time around, though, the supermodel in question only had eyes for Mark (Andrew Lincoln) and his beard. Sorry, Juliet (Keira Knightley). \n \n Take a look at the first snippet below. \n \n And if you\u2019re a sucker for spoilers, you can also catch a few other excerpts posted by fans on Twitter. (The full special won\u2019t air in the U.S. until May.) The first shows that Hugh Grant\u2019s prime minister is well acquainted with Drake\u2019s discography. \n \n The second shows what happens when one is well acquainted with Drake\u2019s discography. . . and not 10 Downing Street\u2019s steps. (Even after all of these years, we know.) \n \n The third shows that Thomas Brodie-Sangster\u2019s Sam is not in jail for blowing past multiple airport security checkpoints to meet Olivia Olson\u2019s character. \n \n In a statement, Love Actually writer/director Richard Curtis explained of the follow-up\u2019s format, \u201cI would never have dreamt of writing a sequel to Love Actually, but I thought it might be fun to do 10 minutes to see what everyone is now up to. Who has aged best?\u2014I guess that's the big question. . .or is it so obviously Liam [Neeson]?\u201d \n \n In a behind-the-scenes video released last week, Hugh Grant joked that he has been refusing annual invitations for Love Actually reunions for years. \n \n \u201cThis nightmare with Richard happens every bloody year,\u201d Grant deadpanned. (Love Actually writer/director Richard Curtis is the long-time romantic partner of Red Nose Day\u2019s director Emma Freud\u2014which might explain why Curtis & the Love Actually Co. were tempted to reunite in the past.) \n \n \u201cSome years I can fob him off with money,\u201d Grant says. \u201c\u2018I\u2019m not doing that. Here\u2019s a check.\u2019\u201d \n \n Not everyone was as much of a Love Actually grinch, though. McCutcheon had a more rom-com appropriate response to the news that there would be a reunion: \u201cMy heart\u2014there was a little skip, a little jump.\u201d \n \n Stateside fans can watch the complete Love Actually reunion when it airs on May 25 on NBC. \n \n Do you have what it takes? \n \n Test your knowledge of the Seven Kingdoms with Vanity Fair \u2019s Game of Unknowns. \n \n Make your predictions ||||| Get celebs updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!

And she's still lovely. #rednosedayactually pic.twitter.com/MGtUVDGiBE \u2014 emma freud (@emmafreud) March 5, 2017 \n \n However, the special was tinged with some sadness as the much-loved Alan Rickman was absent following his sudden death last year. \n \n The only thing that makes me sad is that Alan Rickman didn't get to witness this or be a part of this \ud83d\udc94 #LoveActually #RedNoseDay \u2014 Kaja \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udc3e (@blackrose1002) March 24, 2017 \n \n Emma Thompson, who played his wife who was cheated on in the original movie, recently said it would be \"too sad and too soon\" after Rickman's death for her to take part in the film's Comic Relief sequel. \n \n Kris Marshall, who played the hopeless-in-love Colin Frissell , who moves to America to try his luck with the ladies in the 2003 movie, also revealed he wouldn't be starring in the movie's second outing. \n \n Other highlights of the Comic Relief special included Take That\u2019s Carpool Karaoke, some live rapping from Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders, and appearances from Alan Partridge and Mrs Brown. ||||| After weeks of hype, the Love, Actually Comic Relief short sequel, Red Nose Day, Actually, finally aired tonight. It might not compare to Stephen\u2019s version of events, but was exactly what you\u2019d expect, really \u2013 the most memorable elements of each plotline recreated and recycled, with lots of jokes about the charity added in. So what did Red Nose Day, Actually actually teach us? \n \n Andrew Lincoln\u2019s character was always a creep \n \n It was weird to show up outside Keira Knightley\u2019s house in 2003, and it\u2019s even weirder now, when you haven\u2019t seen each other in almost a decade. Please stop. \n \n It\u2019s also really weird to bring your supermodel wife purely to show her off like a trophy. She doesn\u2019t even know these people. She must be really confused. Let her go home, \u201cMark\u201d. \n \n Kate Moss is forever a great sport \n \n Judging by the staggering number of appearances she makes at these things, Kate Moss has never said no to a charity appearance, even when she\u2019s asked to do the most ridiculous and frankly insulting things, like pretend she would ever voluntarily have sex with \u201cMark\u201d. \n \n Self-service machines are a gift and a curse \n \n In reality, Rowan Atkinson\u2019s gift-wrapping enthusiast would have lasted about one hour in Sainsbury\u2019s before being replaced by a machine. \n \n Colin Firth\u2019s character is an utter embarrassment, pull yourself together man \n \n You\u2019re a writer, Colin. You make a living out of paying attention to language and words. You\u2019ve been married to your Portuguese-speaking wife for almost fourteen years. You learned enough to make a terrible proposal all those years ago. Are you seriously telling me you haven\u2019t learned enough to sustain a single conversation with your family? Do you hate them? Kind of seems that way, Colin. \n \n Even gay subtext is enough to get you killed \n \n As Eleanor Margolis reminds us, a deleted storyline from the original Love, Actually was one in which \u201cthe resplendent Frances de la Tour plays the terminally ill partner of a \u201cstern headmistress\u201d with a marshmallow interior (Anne Reid).\u201d Of course, even in deleted scenes, gay love stories can only end in death, especially in 2003. The same applies to 2017\u2019s Red Nose Day actually. Many fans speculated that Bill Nighy\u2019s character was in romantic love with his manager, Joe \u2013 so, reliably, Joe has met a tragic end by the time the sequel rolls around. \n \n Hugh Grant is a fantasy Prime Minister for 2017 \n \n Telling a predatory POTUS to fuck off despite the pressure to preserve good relations with the USA? Inspirational. No wonder he\u2019s held on to office this long, despite only demonstrating skills of \u201cswearing\u201d, \u201cpossibly harassing junior staff members\u201d and \u201csomewhat rousing narration\u201d. \n \n If you get together in Christmas 2003, you will stay together forever. It\u2019s just science. \n \n Even if you\u2019ve spent nearly fourteen years clinging onto public office. Even if you were a literal child when you met. Even if you hate your wife so much you refuse to learn her first language. \n \n Now listen to the SRSLY Love, Actually special:",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Love Actually fans went nuts when it was announced that a 12-minute sequel would air during the UK's Red Nose Day as part of its Comic Relief special last Friday. The spot doesn't officially air in the US until May, but this being 2017 and all, video snippets and recaps abound. And, well, bad news for those aforementioned fans\u2014many people say the Love Actually bit was not so great. Spoilers ahead: On Cracked, Amanda Mannen writes that the sequel \"destroys\" the original movie. You find out that Mark apparently hasn't seen his one-time best friend Peter at all in the 13 years since he declared his love for Peter's new bride in the film, then-little-boy Sam never did move on from Joanna and may in fact have creepily followed her to the United States, and Jamie and Aurelia still don't speak one another's languages. Bottom line? \"Love actually is more complicated than a slightly overlong Christmas movie, and that's kind of terrifying.\" At the Mirror, Adam Postans describes the sequel bit as \"a poor man\u2019s Four Weddings and a Funeral that \u00addelivered precisely nothing.\" At the Guardian, Barbara Ellen suggests the sequel should have been named Guff Actually. \"It was all lousy jokes and texted-in performances and looked as though it had been cobbled together by fourth formers as an end-of-term project,\" she writes. Another Guardian reviewer, Peter Bradshaw, calls the spot \"bafflingly weak.\" He does note that, as to the inevitable question of who aged the best, it's clearly Martine McCutcheon, who played the prime minister's wife\u2014\"she genuinely doesn't look any different from 2003.\" The sequel has taught us that \"if you get together in Christmas 2003, you will stay together forever. It\u2019s just science,\" writes Anna Leszkiewicz at the New Statesman. \"Even if you\u2019ve spent nearly 14 years clinging onto public office. Even if you were a literal child when you met.

Sanctions that have so far focused on individuals via visa bans and asset freezes may be expanded to target specific areas of the economy. \n \n President Vladimir Putin sent his popularity surging to a five-year high by making Crimea a part of Russia again after 60 years and says he won\u2019t be swayed by foreign retaliation. Even so, the costs of the decision are starting to unfold, with Russian stocks this year\u2019s worst performers and the economy set to suffer more than the West, said Mircea Geoana, Romania\u2019s government representative for diplomacy and economic projects. \n \n It's Personal: The Individuals Targeted by U.S. Sanctions \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re witnessing the start of a new geopolitical and economic Cold War and I think it will take at least two to three years to establish some sort of equilibrium,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ones who\u2019ll pay the bill for this aggression, no matter how popular and patriotic it looks, will be the Russian people because there\u2019s a huge difference between the economic force of the EU and the U.S. and that of Russia.\u201d \n \n Stocks, Ruble \n \n Russia\u2019s Micex stock index has plunged 13.7 percent this year compared with a 5 percent decline for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. It was down 0.7 percent at 6:50 p.m. in Moscow. \n \n The ruble is the second-worst performer against the dollar behind Argentina among 24 developing-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg, weakening 9 percent. It rose 0.4 percent today. \n \n Full Coverage of the Crisis in Ukraine: \n \n Investors pulled out $5.5 billion from Russian equities and bonds this year through March 20, already approaching the total outflow of $6.1 billion for the whole 2013, according to data compiled by EPFR Global, a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based firm tracking fund flows. \n \n After the U.S. expanded sanctions March 20 to include businessmen linked to Putin, such as billionaires Gennady Timchenko and Arkady Rotenberg, Standard & Poor\u2019s and Fitch Ratings cut their outlook on Russia\u2019s credit grade to negative from stable, suggesting a downgrade is most likely next. \n \n The two companies, which said Western banks are becoming reluctant to lend to Russia, rate the world\u2019s biggest energy exporter at BBB, the second-lowest investment grade and on par with Brazil and South Africa. \n \n Crisis Signs \n \n A Snapshot of Ukraine's Past and Future \n \n Even before the standoff with the West, the worst since the Cold War, Russia\u2019s economy was facing the weakest growth since a 2009 recession as consumer demand failed to make up for sagging investment. The current situation in the economy \u201cbears clear signs of a crisis,\u201d Deputy Economy Minister Sergei Belyakov said March 17 after the first European Union and U.S. sanctions. \n \n Russia will probably dip into a recession in the second and third quarters of this year as \u201cdomestic demand is set to halt on the uncertainty shock and tighter financial conditions,\u201d according to Moscow-based VTB. \n \n Russia\u2019s central bank unexpectedly raised its benchmark interest rate by 150 basis points after the armed takeover of Crimea triggered a rout in the ruble. Putin completed his annexation of the Black Sea peninsula March 21. \n \n \u2018Mosquito Bite\u2019 \n \n Russia may shun foreign debt markets in 2014 because of higher borrowing costs, according to Finance Minister Anton Siluanov. He expressed frustration at disruptions to MasterCard Inc. and Visa services for cards issued by banks on or linked to persons on the U.S. sanctions list. \n \n \u201cSome people say these sanctions won\u2019t affect Russia\u2019s financial system but they already are,\u201d he said March 21. \n \n Even so, the measures may not have much effect on the individuals targeted or on Putin\u2019s thinking on Ukraine, whose government accuses the Russian leader of stirring up unrest elsewhere and planning an invasion of the country\u2019s east. \n \n The sanctions represent \u201ca mosquito bite\u201d because most officials on the list aren\u2019t permitted to travel abroad privately and have most of their business in Russia, said Konstantin Kostin, a Kremlin adviser who heads the Civil Society Development Fund. Government members featured in a new EU list March 21 include Putin aides Sergei Glazyev and Vladislav Surkov. \n \n Putin, meanwhile, would require stiffer penalties to budge, according to Ariel Cohen, senior fellow at the Republican-leaning Heritage Foundation in Washington. \n \n No Retreat \n \n \u201cYou\u2019re dealing with an individual who won\u2019t be easily intimidated,\u201d he said March 21 by phone from Washington. \u201cThe West is escalating sanctions but Russia isn\u2019t going to back off on Crimea and Ukraine that easily. It will take more than pinpointed individual sanctions to start rolling this back.\u201d \n \n Russia imposed retaliatory sanctions on 13 Canadians today, banning them from entering the country. In a possible escalation, U.S. President Barack Obama has authorized potential future penalties on Russian industries, including financial services, energy, metals and mining, defense and engineering. \n \n The EU, which relies on Russia for a third of its energy imports, has struggled to find ways of punishing Putin because trade steps risk damaging Europe\u2019s economy. Banking curbs would hurt Britain, an arms embargo would bar France from selling Mistral-class helicopter carriers to the Kremlin and cutbacks in gas purchases would harm a swathe of EU nations. \n \n Threat Effect \n \n The declines in Russian stocks, weakness in the ruble and the risk of downgrades to the country\u2019s credit rating show threats of future sanctions can erode business confidence and hurt the economy, according to Fredrik Erixon, director of the European Centre for International Political Economy. \n \n \u201cInvestors and ratings agencies are basing their views not on what\u2019s happened with sanctions so far but on what may happen,\u201d he said March 21 by phone from Brussels. \n \n The benchmark Micex stock index has lost 13 percent and the ruble is down 8.4 percent against the dollar since Nov. 21, the start of protests that ousted Kremlin-backed former President Viktor Yanukovych and triggered the crisis. \n \n Capital outflows from Russia may reach $70 billion in the first quarter, more than the $63 billion recorded in the whole of 2013, London-based Capital Economics Ltd. said last week in a report. \n \n Outflows of $100 billion this year would risk zero growth, Herman Gref, chief executive officer of Russia\u2019s biggest lender, OAO Sberbank, said today. \n \n To contact the reporters on this story: Andra Timu in Bucharest at atimu@bloomberg.net; Henry Meyer in Moscow at hmeyer4@bloomberg.net; Olga Tanas in Moscow at otanas@bloomberg.net \n \n To contact the editors responsible for this story: Balazs Penz at bpenz@bloomberg.net Andrew Langley ||||| Visa and MasterCard suspended services for Bank Rossiya, whose main branch in St. Petersburg is shown here. (Photo: Elena Ignatyeva, AP) \n \n MOSCOW \u2014 Sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin's inner circle won't affect him, experts here say, but average Russians believe it is they who will feel the brunt of the economic penalties. \n \n The United States and Europe have issued travel bans and asset freezes against 20 Russian officials and businessmen to deter the Kremlin from further aggression against Ukraine, where Russian troops have effectively taken over the province of Crimea. \n \n \"The position of officialdom and business is that these sanctions aren't hitting Russia very hard, while harsher economic sanctions are problematic for Western countries themselves,\" said Dmitry Danilov, head of the European security department at the Institute of Europe of the Russian Academy of Sciences. \n \n The effects of the sanctions were felt in Moscow on Friday, where several banks said that Visa and MasterCard stopped providing services for payment transactions. \n \n Visa and MasterCard suspended services on Friday for Bank Rossiya, whose shareholder, Yuri Kovalchuk, is widely reputed to be close to Putin. Both Kovalchuk and Bank Rossiya fell under the sanctions imposed Thursday. \n \n The bank, ranked the 17th largest in Russia, provides services for 24,000 corporate clients and 470,000 private clients. Russia's SMP Bank, whose shareholders, Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, had been sanctioned, also said that Visa and MasterCard had suspended services for the bank's card holders. \n \n The credit card companies resumed working with SMP on Saturday, Interfax quoted a bank representative as saying, because the sanctions had been imposed on shareholders but not on the bank itself. \n \n However, credit card services at Bank Rossiya continued to be blocked. Ordinary Russians feared the fallout from the sanctions would trickle down to them. \n \n \"These sanctions are taking us back to central planning,\" said entrepreneur Sonya Sokolova, who heads the Zvuki.ru online music portal. \"No one can punish Russia as much as it punishes itself.\" \n \n Others who have grown accustomed to taking advantage of Western payment transaction services such as Visa and MasterCard fear that the problems could spread to other banks, with entrepreneurs asking who could be next after Kovalchuk and the Rotenberg brothers. \n \n The problem will affect mostly regular workers, says Sokolova. Employees are increasingly asking that their salaries be transferred in cash, local entrepreneurs told Moscow news media. \n \n Russia's RTS index fell 4.5% on Friday on news of the new round of Washington sanctions. But what Russians feared more than the sanctions themselves were the Russian government's response to the penalties. \n \n A bill was introduced into Russia's parliament on Friday to ban transaction services that were based outside of Russia. While the draft was part of a bid to develop Russia's own transaction services, in effect it would mean that credit card companies such as Visa and MasterCard would not service clients in Russia. \n \n \"The fact that our banks use infrastructure that they cannot control carries a real threat for national security and makes it possible for Russian banks to be cut off from international payment services, in the manner which we have seen today,\" ITAR-TASS quoted lawmaker Vladislav Reznik, who introduced the bill, as saying on Friday. \n \n \"There is talk of creating a national payment transaction system, and what that means is that no one's deposits will be safe,\" said Sokolova, the entrepreneur. \"Isolation will increase.\" \n \n \"From the standpoint of the average population, they will blame the West for this, not Putin,\" Sokolova said, noting that polls indicate Putin's popularity has skyrocketed since Russia intervened in Ukraine earlier this month. \n \n Danilov said the current sanctions would not be very effective. \n \n \"There is no consensus on sanction within the European Union,\" which has a trade turnover of nearly $400 billion with Russia that many EU countries would not want to jeopardize. \n \n \"Given Russia's power structure, it's clear that business is oriented toward politics and they would have to adapt [to new political realities] in any case,\" Danilov said. \"Business and officialdom are more concerned about the situation in Ukraine and their trade ties there than they are about the sanctions.\" \n \n Putin laughed off the sanctions on Friday, joking that he would have to \"stay away\" from the 20 sanctioned officials. He warned that Russia can sanction, too, and has issued travel bans to Moscow against Western officials. He also pledged to open an account at Bank Rossiya out of solidarity. \n \n Pro-Kremlin expert and adviser Sergei Markov said that average Russians would not really be affected by the sanctions. \n \n \"In fact, they will be enthusiastic about the sanctions, because they help solve one of Russia's key problem, that the elite is seen as stealing Russia's resources and taking them abroad,\" Markov said. \n \n \"These sanctions lower the dependence of Russia's business elite on the West. Washington's sanctions go in line with President Putin's policies of de-offshorization.\" ||||| Ukrainian tanks are transported from their base in Perevalne, outside Simferopol, Crimea, March 26, 2014. \n \n Ukrainian soldiers transport their tanks from their base in Perevalnoe, outside Simferopol, Crimea, March 26, 2014. \n \n Russian police cars drive and Ukrainian soldiers walk behind Ukrainian tanks at Perevalnoe, outside Simferopol, Crimea, March 26, 2014. \n \n Crimean retirees line up to get their pensions in Russian rubles inside a post office in Simferopol, Crimea, March 25, 2014. \n \n Ukrainian marines prepare to leave their base in Feodosia, Crimea, March 25, 2014. \n \n Russian sailors stand on board the ship Aleksandrovets at the port of Sevastopol, Crimea, March 25, 2014. \n \n Ukrainian sailors leave the Konstantin Olshansky navy ship in the bay of Donuzlav, Crimea, March 24, 2014. \n \n People line up to apply for Russian passports in Sevastopol, Crimea, March 24, 2014. \n \n A man carries a placard with currency rates at an exchange office in Sevastopol, Crimea, March 24, 2014. \u25c0 \u25b6 < \u25b6 || > 1/9 ... \u21f1 Disable Captions Enable Captions \n \n Russian bank SMP showed the impact of U.S. punitive measures over Ukraine on Monday, saying around nine billion rubles [$248 million] had been withdrawn by depositors since Washington imposed sanctions against two of its shareholders last week.Washington imposed sanctions on Thursday against 20 Russians close to President Vladimir Putin over Moscow's involvement in the Ukraine crisis, including Boris Rotenberg and his older brother Arkady, the co-owners of SMP Bank.SMP CEO Dmitry Kalantyrsky told a news conference that an estimated four billion rubles had been withdrawn by individuals and five billion by organizations.On Friday, SMP said Visa and MasterCard had stopped providing services for payment transactions for its clients.

The idea is to weaken Putin so he can be contained.\u201d \n \n President Barack Obama last week expanded financial sanctions to 20 more Russian officials, billionaires and a bank, including brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, who have joint investments with Firtash in Ukraine and Russia. The Rotenbergs\u2019 companies received $7 billion of contracts for the Sochi Winter Olympics and are major suppliers to Gazprom. \n \n Photographer: Efrem Lukatsky/ Bloomberg Dmitry Firtash, Ukrainian billionaire, speaks during an interview in his office in Kiev in a Jan. 31, 2009 file photo.

Read More Close Open Photographer: Efrem Lukatsky/ Bloomberg Dmitry Firtash, Ukrainian billionaire, speaks during an interview in his office in Kiev in a Jan. 31, 2009 file photo. \n \n Most Wanted \n \n Firtash, 48, built his fortune as a broker of Russia\u2019s gas sales to Ukraine, one of Gazprom\u2019s biggest export markets. He and a partner owned half of RosUkrEnergo, which was founded in 2004 and emerged as Ukraine\u2019s sole gas importer in 2006 to 2009, between price disputes with Russia that led to supply halts and shortages across Europe. \n \n Gazprom oversaw the other half of RosUkrEnergo, which Ukraine\u2019s security service in 2005 said may be indirectly controlled by Semion Mogilevich, an organized crime suspect on the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s most-wanted list. Firtash has repeatedly denied any link between Mogilevich and RosUkrEnergo. A lawyer for Mogilevich, who lives in Moscow, said his client has never been in business with Firtash. \n \n Read About Other Individuals Targeted by U.S. Sanctions \n \n Still, the former U.S. ambassador in Kiev, William Taylor, said Firtash himself told him that he needed Mogilevich\u2019s permission to get into the lucrative gas business with Gazprom, according to a secret cable to the Central Intelligence Agency that was published by Wikileaks and dated Dec. 10, 2008. \n \n \u2018Personal Interests\u2019 \n \n \u201cFirtash may know whether Ukrainian officials and managers of Gazprom and Gazprombank had personal economic interests in these transactions,\u201d former Gazprom Deputy Chairman Alexander Ryazanov said in an interview in Moscow. \n \n Gazprom\u2019s spokesman, Sergei Kupriyanov, said the company sees no negative consequences from the possible extradition of Firtash to the U.S. \n \n Graphic: Mapping the Conflict in Ukraine \n \n For years, Gazprom sold gas to Ukraine at lower than western European rates as a gesture of goodwill to Russia\u2019s fellow former Soviet state. The RosUkrEnergo deals allowed the company to sell cheap gas from Turkmenistan at much higher rates in Europe, which helped subsidize Ukraine\u2019s domestic market. Gazprom investors criticized the scheme at the time for introducing an unnecessary player in transactions that the Russian monopoly could perform itself. \n \n \u2018Personal Bank\u2019 \n \n The twin pillars of Putin\u2019s economy, Gazprom, the world\u2019s largest gas producer, and state oil champion OAO Rosneft (ROSN), are already both potential targets of sanctions. Gazprom Chief Executive Officer Alexey Miller and Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin may be among officials banned from the European Union, Germany\u2019s Bild newspaper reported March 15, a move the bloc has yet to carry out in two rounds of sanctions. \n \n Obama signed a separate order on March 20 authorizing potential penalties on Russian industries such as energy, finance, mining and defense. Bank Rossiya, a St. Petersburg lender founded by three Putin associates in 1990, was put on the sanctions list last for being, as the Treasury Department said, \u201cthe personal bank for senior officials.\u201d \n \n Graphic: What Crimea Is Costing Putin \n \n Leaders of the U.S., the European Union, China, Japan and others meet in The Hague today, with Obama seeking to mobilize opposition to Putin\u2019s incursion into Crimea. \n \n Russian anti-corruption activist and opposition leader Alexey Navalny, who\u2019s under house arrest in Moscow, said March 20 that Miller and Sechin, as longtime Putin allies with key positions in his power structure, should be included in any regime of penalties put together by the West. \n \n \u2018Loyal Elite\u2019 \n \n \u201cWestern nations could deliver a serious blow to the luxurious lifestyle enjoyed by the Kremlin\u2019s cronies who shuttle between Russia and the West,\u201d Navalny said in a commentary in the New York Times. (NYT) \u201cThis means freezing the oligarchs\u2019 financial assets and seizing their property.\u201d \n \n Miller, 52, and Sechin, 53, both worked for Putin in the St. Petersburg mayor\u2019s office in the 1990s. Miller, CEO since 2001, declined to comment on the possibility of his inclusion on the blacklist, according to Kupriyanov. Sechin, a former deputy premier who\u2019s overseen Rosneft since 2004 as chairman, then CEO, denounced all Western \u201cthreats and blackmail,\u201d according to an e-mailed comment. \n \n \u201cAs far as the loyal elite is concerned, sanctions have always led to a consolidation of forces to counter pressure from outside,\u201d said Sechin, who spearheaded Rosneft\u2019s takeover of Yukos Oil Co. to become Russia\u2019s largest crude producer after the 2003 jailing of Yukos owner Mikhail Khodorkovsky. \n \n Excluding Miller and Sechin leaves \u201cheadroom for additional sanctions,\u201d said Cliff Kupchan, an analyst at Eurasia Group in New York. So far, the U.S. sanctions have been \u201ctargeted,\u201d unlike the sweeping penalties against Iran over its nuclear program that are designed to sever \u201cvast swathes of the economy\u201d from the West, Kupchan said in a research note. \n \n FBI Probe \n \n The U.S. law, if passed by both houses of Congress and signed by Obama, would authorize the president to impose sanctions against Russian officials or their associates or family members involved in the \u201cexpropriation of private or public assets for personal gain, corruption related to government contracts or the extraction of natural resources, bribery, or the facilitation or transfer of the proceeds of corruption to foreign jurisdictions.\u201d \n \n Firtash, worth $2.3 billion according to Kiev-based Korrespondent magazine, was arrested March 14 on suspicion of bribery and criminal conspiracy, according to an Austrian police statement. The charges are the result of several years of investigation by the FBI and aren\u2019t \u201crelated to recent events in Ukraine,\u201d the U.S. Department of Justice said. \n \n Firtash, who owns titanium assets in Crimea, paid a record 125 million-euro ($172 million) bail on March 20 to win release during extradition hearings. He criticized his arrest as a \u201cpurely political\u201d act. \n \n Boeing, India \n \n The case involves allegations of bribes paid by a Swiss company controlled by Firtash, Bothli, to obtain licenses to mine titanium ore in Andhra Pradesh with a state-run Indian company and build plants to produce titanium sponge with Boeing Co. (BA) in India, according to two people familiar with the investigation who asked not to be identified. \n \n Boeing agreed in 2006 to conduct a feasibility study into the project with Bothli and then decided not to pursue it, the Chicago-based company said in an e-mailed response to questions. Firtash\u2019s point man for the project, Suren Gevorgyan, said Bothli never paid a bribe to get permits because India was eager to receive Boeing\u2019s planned investment. \n \n The charges seem designed to get Firtash inside the U.S. and persuade him to cut a deal for information about Gazprom and people close to Putin, Ariel Cohen, senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, said by phone. \n \n \u2018Severe Consequences\u2019 \n \n \u201cFirtash was very deeply involved in the fine print of Gazprom\u2019s dealings in Ukraine, in the financial transactions,\u201d said Korchemkin of East European Gas Analysis. \u201cIf Firtash strikes a deal with the FBI and starts to give testimony it could threaten severe consequences for Gazprom managers and the company itself.\u201d \n \n Any disclosure that shows Gazprom managers causing losses to U.S. investors, who hold more than half of the company\u2019s depositary receipts, could lead to sanctions, major fines and lawsuits, Korchemkin said. Putin\u2019s political protege, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, was Gazprom\u2019s chairman in 2002-2008. Medvedev\u2019s spokeswoman, Natalia Timakova, declined to comment on the possibility that the premier may face sanctions. \n \n \u201cThese sanctions are designed to touch important people close to the Kremlin and have a geopolitical impact rather than a direct effect on earnings at other banks,\u201d said Hadrien de Belle, an analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods, a New-York based financial services company. \u201cThis has to be perceived as going after the financial conduits for the wealth of the targets.\u201d \n \n Abramovich, Usmanov \n \n Two other billionaires close to Putin, former Gazprom adviser Alisher Usmanov and Roman Abramovich, both of whom are shareholders of London soccer clubs, are prime candidates for sanctions, said Navalny, the opposition leader. \n \n The bulk of Abramovich\u2019s $14 billion wealth, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire\u2019s Index, came from the sale of OAO Sibneft, the oil company he acquired for about $100 million in 1996. He sold it to Gazprom for $13 billion a decade later. Abramovich\u2019s spokesman, John Mann, declined to comment. \n \n Usmanov, 60, is Russia\u2019s richest man, with a fortune of $17.4 billion. He cut his U.S. stock holdings this year, selling his shares in Apple Inc. and reducing his interest in Facebook Inc., according to Ivan Streshinskiy, head of Usmanov\u2019s asset-management company USM Advisors LLC. \n \n Sanctions are \u201ccounterproductive\u201d for all parties involved because the global economy is interconnected, Usmanov told reporters in Moscow on March 20. He didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment sent to his representatives. \n \n \u201cEveryone has to decide whether they want to bring back their assets to Russia and stay within sealed borders,\u201d Lipman of the Carnegie Center said. \u201cThis is a bleak prospect for many people.\u201d \n \n To contact the reporters on this story: Irina Reznik in Moscow at ireznik@bloomberg.net; Henry Meyer in Moscow at hmeyer4@bloomberg.net \n \n To contact the editors responsible for this story: Hellmuth Tromm at htromm@bloomberg.net; Balazs Penz at bpenz@bloomberg.net Brad Cook ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Cameron: \"There's not going to be a G8 summit this year in Russia\" \n \n The G8 summit will not take place in Russia this year, UK Prime Minister David Cameron has said. \n \n Speaking in the Netherlands, Mr Cameron said it was \"absolutely clear\" the planned June meeting of world leaders in the Russian resort of Sochi would not happen owing to events in Ukraine. \n \n The EU and US have imposed sanctions on Russian officials after Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. \n \n Moscow has also been warned of further action if it does not change course. \n \n The announcement that the Sochi meeting had been effectively cancelled came after Russian troops seized control of the last major military base in Crimea. \n \n Mr Cameron, US President Barack Obama and other G8 leaders are attending a nuclear co-operation summit in The Hague, to which Russian President Vladimir Putin was not invited. \n \n 'Illegal annexation' \n \n \"We should be clear there's not going to be a G8 summit in Russia,\" Mr Cameron said, urging Russia to \"change course\". \n \n The G7 leaders plus EU representatives issued a declaration after their meeting in The Hague noting that \"international law prohibits the acquisition of part or all of another state's territory through coercion or force\". \n \n Image copyright AFP \n \n \"To do so violates the principles upon which the international system is built,\" they said. \n \n \"We condemn the illegal referendum held in Crimea in violation of Ukraine's constitution.

    "document": "President Obama makes a statement on the situation in Iraq and in Ferguson, Mo., at Martha's Vineyard, Mass., on Aug. 14, 2014. (Photo: Nicholas Kamm, AFP/Getty Images) \n \n Addressing crises both domestic and foreign, President Obama appealed for calm Thursday amid violent protests in a St. Louis suburb, and said a rescue operation for religious minorities in Iraq will not be necessary. \n \n Obama, speaking from his vacation at Martha's Vineyard, Mass., called the weekend death of 18-year-old Michael Brown a tragedy, and urged police and protesters in Ferguson, Mo., to \"take a step back\" and consider how to best move forward. \n \n \"Now's the time for healing,\" Obama said. \"Now's the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson.\" \n \n STORY: Governor vows a 'different tone' on Ferguson's streets \n \n STORY: Michael Brown had no criminal record, police say \n \n The president called on local police to be \"open and transparent\" about their investigation of Brown's death. He said there is never an excuse for looting and violence toward police officers, and \"there's also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests, or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.\" \n \n In particular, Obama criticized police for detaining two journalists during protests Wednesday, and for threatening others. Officers \"should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground,\" he said. \n \n Police have used tear gas and smoke bombs on crowds who gathered to protest the death of Brown on Saturday; some protesters have thrown Molotov cocktails. \n \n Obama called the teenager's death \"heartbreaking and tragic,\" and said the Department of Justice is working with local officials on the investigation. The president said he made it clear to Attorney General Eric Holder that \"we should do what is necessary to help determine exactly what happened and to see that justice is done.\" \n \n The president also said he spoke with Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, calling him \"a good man.\" \n \n While \"emotions are raw right now\" and \"there are certainly passionate differences about what has happened,\" Obama asked citizens to remember that all Americans remain united by common values. \n \n \"That includes belief in equality under the law, a basic respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protest,\" Obama said. \"A reverence for the dignity of every single man, woman and child among us and the need for accountability when it comes to our government.\" \n \n As for Iraq, Obama said there has been progress with the limited military mission he announced last week. \n \n Earlier in the week, the Obama administration began considering a rescue operation for members of the Yazidi religion who were trapped atop Mount Sinjar in northern Iraq, surrounded by Islamic State fighters. \n \n On Wednesday, a Pentagon assessment team reported that most of the Yazidi have escaped, and a full-scale rescue operation would not be needed. \n \n \"We broke the ISIL siege of Mount Sinjar,\" Obama said. \"We helped vulnerable people reach safety; and we helped save many innocent lives.\" \n \n He added, \"I could not be prouder of the men and women of our military who carried out this humanitarian operation almost flawlessly.\" \n \n Obama said airstrikes would continue against militants who are threatening U.S. personnel and others in northern Iraq. Humanitarian relief to displaced Iraqis will also continue. \n \n The president praised development of a new government in Iraq, saying it will be better able to eventually take control of the fight against militants. \n \n Said Obama: \"We are modestly hopeful that the Iraqi government situation is moving in the right direction.\" \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/VpCRbA ||||| McCulloch blasts Nixon \n \n St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch Thursday night blasted the decision by Gov. Jay Nixon to replace St. Louis County Police control of the Ferguson situation with the Missouri State Highway Patrol. \n \n \u201cIt's shameful what he did today, he had no legal authority to do that,\" McCulloch said. \"To denigrate the men and women of the county police department is shameful.\" \n \n McCulloch noted that no one was seriously injured in the effort led by County Police Chief Jon Belmar until Nixon handed control of the Ferguson over to the state agency on Thursday. \n \n \u201cFor Nixon to never talk to the commanders in the field and come in here and take this action is disgraceful,\" McCulloch said. \n \n \"I hope I'm wrong, but I think what Nixon did may put a lot of people in danger.\" \n \n Paul Hampel, 8:33 p.m. \n \n Two assaults reported \n \n A Washington University student was reportedly assaulted near the Ferguson McDonald's in what one witness said appeared to be a knock-out game. \n \n Restaurant employees gave the unidentified victim ice to ease face swelling. Acquaintances subsequently transported him to a hospital. \n \n The victim praised the \"many people here (who) rushed to help me.\" \n \n Eli Rosenberg, a reporter for KMBC in Kansas City, meanwhile tweeted that an unknown assailant delivered four punches to the face of his cameraman. \n \n \"Paramedics say (the cameraman) will feel it in the morning, but should be okay,\" Rosenberg tweeted. \n \n Paul Hampel at 12:05 p.m. \n \n Black Panthers help Ferguson head in the right direction \n \n A half-dozen members of the New Black Panther political movement were out on West Florissant Avenue Thursday night as night fell. Not a police officer was in sight. The New Black Panthers directed traffic. \n \n \"If you want the police to stay away, somebody has to do it. Nobody is doing it,\" said Jarren Brown, aka \"Brother Genius,\" as he signaled to cars, stopping some so others could turn on side streets, stopping others so some can turn off side streets. \n \n The group, wearing all black and at least one with a small New Black Panthers pin on his lapel, worked up a sweat as they moved. They exuded a friendly but firm stance, urging the slowing, honking cars on West Florissant to move along. \n \n Koran Addo at 8:55 p.m. \n \n No police presence on West Florissant Avenue \n \n A cheer went up as police departed the area near the Ferguson QuikTrip looted and burned during a night of unrest Sunday night. \n \n Demonstrators remained on the sidewalk after the departure and did not attempt to block traffic on West Florissant Avenue. Motorists signaled their support for the protesters by honking their horns and the chant of \"Hands Up! Don't Shoot!\" occasionally filled the air. \n \n But the scene near the site where Michael Brown was gunned down last Saturday remained calm. \n \n Paula Lotts of St. Louis, came to Ferguson Thursday night to support her three boys. \n \n \u201cIt's sad our children have to live like this,\" she told a reporter. \"We're not scared of people in the community, we're afraid of the police. The police stop our kids everywhere they go. Every black child is not doing wrong. Please don't put our children in that category. It's not a black-white thing - it's a police thing.\" \n \n Koran Addo at 7:10 p.m. \n \n Peaceful march \n \n As many as 300 marchers made their way along West Florissant Avenue late Thursday afternoon in the most peaceful demonstration since the shooting death of Michael Brown five days ago. \n \n Capt. Ronald Johnson, the Missouri State Highway Patrol officer Gov. Jay Nixon placed in charge of the Ferguson situation Thursday afternoon led the procession. \n \n Johnson marched in shirtsleeves - a stark contrast with the para-military uniforms that have become the symbol of the Ferguson police presence during nearly a week of unrest. \n \n In an impromptu discussion with reporters, Johnson allowed that he has \"a big dog in this fight.\" \n \n Johnson grew up nearby, close to the intersection of Halls Ferry and Chambers Roads. \n \n \"I occasionally go to Red's Barbeque,\" he said, giving a shout out to a popular Ferguson restaurant. \"And I've had a few beers in this town, too.\" \n \n Well-wishers and residents handed the marchers bottles of water, pizza, homemade dishes and cookies as they passed. \n \n \"I'm out here hoping for peace for the protesters and the police,\" said Bridgett Norise of Dellwood. \u201cIt's nice to see no divisions. This is the most unity I've seen in years.\" \n \n Her friend, Regina Carter, agreed. \n \n \u201cIt's very nice to see white and black people marching together peacefully,\" she said. \n \n But the presence of Johnson was clearly the difference between Thursday and the four nights of turmoil that preceded it. \n \n \u201cI love this man so much,\u201d said Angela Whitman of Berkeley. \"He's been here since the beginning,giving us encouragement and letting us know we'll get through this.\" \n \n Marchers under Johnson's eye picked up debris along the demonstration route - another sign that perhaps tensions are at at last easing in the troubled North County community. \n \n Paul Hampel and Koran Addo at 6:40 p.m. \n \n Nixon turns police control over to Missouri State Highway Patrol \n \n Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon has given police oversight of the Ferguson situation to the Missouri State Highway Patrol under the command of Capt. Ronald S. Johnson, a St. Louis area native. \n \n Nixon said the change in command will include a softening in \"tone\" and \"amplitude\" regarding protective force. \n \n \"Clearly you'll see as the afternoon and evening starts, a little different picture,\" Nixon said, adding, \"We should all know there will be resources out there if things get difficult, that people will be safe.\" \n \n Nixon addressed questions from the press at the University of Missouri-St. Louis after touring areas of Ferguson. He was flanked by Johnson, St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley and St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay. \n \n Johnson pledged to protect Ferguson while allowing protesters and marchers to have their say. He said he wants to rebuild trust and respect in the community. \n \n \"I grew up here and this is clearly my community and my home. Therefore, this means a lot to me personally,\" he said. \"I understand the anger and fear that the citizens of Ferguson are feeling, and I understand and respect both of those.\" \n \n Earlier today at a gathering at Christ the King United Church of Christ Nixon pledged to make an \"operational shift\" in the way Ferguson protests are being handled by police and had promised to reveal his plans later today. \n \n \"We will have a different approach today,\" Johnson said. He planned to go to the burned out QuikTrip that has been a center for protesters and visit with them. \n \n \u2022\u2022\u2022 \n \n McCaskill calls to \"demilitarize the police response\" \n \n U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill got a standing ovation inside Christ the King United Church of Christ this morning when she told a crowd the county should \"demilitarize the police response\" in Ferguson. \n \n McCaskill spoke moments after Gov. Jay Nixon told the same crowd there would be an \"operational shift\" in the handling of Ferguson. \n \n Afterward she told reporters, \"The police response has been part of the problem.\" \n \n McCaskill told reporters, \"It is my understanding that the county police will be taken off the investigation.\" \n \n But when pressed on it, she didn't elaborate. \n \n Nixon got loud applause from the crowd when he talked about the media. \"If people in the newspapers want to cover things and take pictures and stuff,\" he said. \"They ought to do it. It's a free country.\" \n \n -Kevin McDermott at 11:10 a.m. with updates \n \n \u2022\u2022\u2022 \n \n Obama calls for \"peace and calm\" in Ferguson \n \n President Barack Obama today called again for \"peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson,\" addressing for the second time the police shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown and the violent clashes between police and protesters that have ensued. \n \n \"Let us remember we are all part of one American family,\" Obama said in a short address from Martha's Vineyard, where he is vacationing. \"We are united in common values and that includes belief in equality under the law, basic respect for public order and the right of peaceful protest.\" \n \n Obama also notably gave a vote of confidence to Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon. Obama said he talked with Nixon this morning and \"I expressed my concern over the violent turn of events\" in Ferguson. \n \n \"He is a good man and fine governor,\" Obama said. \n \n Obama said he was briefed this morning on the situation in Ferguson by Attorney General Eric Holder. He criticized the arrest of journalists, said there is no excuse for police use of force against peaceful protesters, and that there is \"never an excuse for violence against police or those who would use this as a cover for vandalism or looting.\" \n \n - Chuck Raasch at 12:10 p.m. Thursday \n \n \u2022\u2022\u2022 \n \n Ferguson Chief outlines plan to \"reduce tensions\" \n \n Calling the situation a \"powder keg,\" Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson signaled a change of strategy this afternoon, describing a plan to try to \"reduce tensions\" by allowing protesters to use sidewalks while keeping streets open to traffic. \n \n He said officials want to tone down the confrontations and will talk about \"not only the tactics but the appearance\" of police in riot gear. He said tactical units would remain on standby in case of trouble. \n \n Pressed about use of tear gas on non-violent demonstrators, Jackson suggested that people need to distance themselves from those who provoke police with aggressive acts or threats. \n \n \"There is gunfire. There are fire bombs being thrown at the police,\" he said. \n \n Jackson said police were devising a plan to make sidewalks around West Florissant available to the protesters, and that they were going to put up cones so people would stay out of the street. Port-A-Potties would also be provided \n \n \"We'll allow them to freely protest for as long as they want,\" he said. \"We want to facilitate their ability to protest because it's a constitutional right.\" \n \n He acknowledged last night's police response did not look good and said, \"there are several meeting going on to evaluate tactics.\" \n \n \"We're going to talk about not only the tactics but the appearance. We're having conversations.\" \n \n Jackson said decisions regarding dispersing crowds with tear gas were made by tactical commanders at the scene \"based on the threat of violence.\" \n \n \"We can't individually go in and say, 'Are you peacefully protesting? Are you throwing rocks? Are you throwing Molotov cocktails?'\" \n \n An Al-Jazeera reporter asked why police shot tear gas at their camera crew on a block with no protesters nearby. Jackson said he wasn't sure who made the decision to do that and would look into it. \"The media is not a target,\" he said. \n \n He also said he didn't know why two reporters were arrested at a McDonald's Wednesday night. \n \n - Pat Gauen and Walker Moskop at 12:35 p.m. Thursday with updates \n \n \u2022\u2022\u2022 \n \n Area clergy plan 5 p.m. peace march with Ferguson youth \n \n The St. Louis Metropolitan Clergy Coalition has planned a 5 p.m. community march \"to stand in solidarity with the peaceful youth of Ferguson so their voices can be heard in the wake of the killing of Michael Brown,\" said The Rev. Michael Kinman of Christ Church Cathedral, in a written release. \n \n \"This is a nonviolent action and our goal is not so much to raise our voices but to make sure the voices of the young people of Ferguson are heard,\" Kinman said in the statement. \n \n Marchers plan to gather at 5 p.m. today at the Mobil station on the corner of West Florissant Ave. and Chambers Road. Clergy were asked to bring their Bibles, \"so that we are marching with the power of the Word of God.\" \n \n Participants were also asked to bring a care package in a clear plastic bag containing toiletries and other items for people who have been unable to go to the store because of the protests and police action. \n \n \"So we take this action not just out of love for the young people of Ferguson and Michael Brown and his family,\" Kinman wrote in the release. \"We take this action out of love for the Ferguson Police Department and all the officers of the many Metropolitan Police Departments who have pledged to protect and serve and who put their lives on the line for this community.\" \n \n - Nancy Cambria at 2:40 p.m. Thursday \n \n \u2022\u2022\u2022 \n \n Two injuries reported from last night's unrest in Ferguson \n \n Christian Hospital treated one 23-year-old male for rubber bullet-related injuries Wednesday evening following the demonstrations in Ferguson, said hospital spokesman Bret Berigan. The patient was released shortly after treatment. \n \n Police also reported an officer injured an ankle when a brick was thrown at him. \n \n - Samantha Liss at 2:45 p.m. Thursday with updates \n \n Moment of silence prior to Cardinals game \n \n Fans at the first St. Louis Cardinals home game since the Saturday shooting of Ferguson teen Michael Brown observed a moment of silence Thursday in honor of the recent Normandy High School graduate. \n \n \"For over a century Cardinals baseball has been an integral part of the fabric of St. Louis \u2013 bringing us together as a community and enriching our lives in so many important ways. St. Louis is a good community with good people who care about one another, our neighborhoods and our region. In recent days we have all been heartbroken by a series of violent events that do not reflect who we are as a people. We ask that you join us tonight in taking a stand against violence as we unite as one community,\" the field announcer told fans prior to the Cardinals contest with the San Diego Padres. \n \n Derrick Goold at 9:50 p.m. \n \n \u2022\u2022\u2022 \n \n Sharpton back to St. Louis on Sunday \n \n Civil rights leader the Rev. Al Sharpton of the National Action Network is heading back to St. Louis to lead a rally in support of Michael Brown. Brown's parents, Attorney Benjamin Crump, the family's lawyer, and Martin Luther King III are all expected to speak at the event. The rally is scheduled for 3 p.m. Sunday at Greater Grace Church in Ferguson. Sharpton spoke at Greater St. Mark Missionary Baptist Church earlier in the week, drawing more than 1,000 supporters. \n \n - Lilly Fowler at 1:50 p.m. Thursday with update of new location \n \n \u2022\u2022\u2022 \n \n St. Charles County swat team releases statement regarding handling of media camera equipment \n \n Amid international criticism of the way law enforcement treated media covering Ferguson last night, the St. Charles County Regional SWAT Team released the following statement this afternoon saying its officers were helping reporters last night: \n \n \"Over the last few days, the St. Charles County Regional SWAT Team has assisted in Ferguson at the request of the St. Louis County Police Department to help respond to looting and for protection of the property of Ferguson citizens and businesses. On Wednesday, August 13th, video footage was taken of St. Charles County SWAT officers handling media camera equipment. The position of the St. Charles County Sheriff\u2019s Department is that the media has the right to cover these events and supports the freedom of the press, and the SWAT Team has not been any part of attempting to prevent media coverage. In fact, last night the SWAT Team officers were assisting the media in moving their camera equipment and media personnel to a safer area with their consent so that they could continue to cover the event. The Sheriff has notified St. Louis County Police that the St. Charles County Regional SWAT Team is available to protect life and property but does not have a continued role in crowd control during this time of civil protest.\" \n \n SWAT teams were heavily criticized on social media after video emerged showing tear gas being lobbed directly at a camera crew for the news organization Al-Jazeera. The SWAT officers were later filmed dismantling the camera equipment. \n \n - Nancy Cambria at 2:05 p.m. with updates \n \n \u2022\u2022\u2022 \n \n McCaskill says riot equipment amplifying tensions \n \n Sen. Claire McCaskill followed Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson to the microphone at a press conference this afternoon, suggesting that the riot equipment used by police has amplified the tension -- and lauding officials' apparent recognition of it. \"I think the demilitarization of the response is going to help a lot,\" she said. \n \n She said most police officers are good people eager to keep the community safe, and could relate better to the protesters as people. \"I\u2019d love it if some of the officers would go over and have a bottle of water with them.\" \n \n As for law enforcement officials' refusal to release information about the case, McCaskill said that letting out information \"in dribs and drabs\" can hamper the quality of the investigation and compromise justice in the end. McCaskill, a Democrat, is a former prosecutor. \n \n - Pat Gauen at 1 p.m. Thursday \n \n \u2022\u2022\u2022 \n \n Ferguson situation resonates at international United Nations conference on civil rights \n \n Delegations of American civil rights officials and activists are in Geneva, Switzerland this week for a United Nations conference on racial equality, and the shooting death of Michael Brown is reverberating there. \n \n \"Clearly this issue is resonating here... and they knew about it before we got here,\" said Hilary O. Shelton, director of the NAACP Washington Bureau. The story \"continues to run in circulation over and over again (on Geneva television).

Jay Nixon should declare a state of emergency in Ferguson and impose a curfew in the St. Louis County \"corridor\" that has seen violence. \n \n \"Whether it's eight o'clock or nine o'clock, whenever it hits, law-abiding people would know they need to be off the street at that time,\" Diehl said in an interview. \"Curfews are routinely and legitimately used as a law enforcement technique in situations like this. \n \n - Virginia Young at 1:20 p.m. Thursday \n \n \u2022\u2022\u2022 \n \n Ferguson situation creates rift between St. Louis city and county police \n \n The militarized police response to protests in Ferguson has become so divisive that it has driven a rare wedge between two forces that often work closely together \u2013 the two largest police departments in the area \u2013 St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department and the St. Louis County Police. \n \n Terry Kennedy, alderman of the 18th Ward, emailed St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson on Wednesday night to discourage him from sending city police officers into Ferguson. A copy of the email exchange was posted on Twitter by community activist John Chasnoff; Dotson could not immediately be reached, but Kennedy confirmed it was authentic. \n \n Kennedy wrote to Dotson: \u201cThe possibility of having St. Louis Police Department personnel present with the Ferguson Police in what appears to be a racially-charged and possibly discriminating environment could make it appear that the St. Louis Police Department supports racial discrimination and disenfranchisement.\u201d \n \n Dotson\u2019s response: \u201cI agree and removed our tactical assistance. We did not send tactical resources to Ferguson on Tuesday or Wednesday. Our only assistance was that of four traffic officers to help divert traffic and keep both pedestrians and motorists safe. On Thursday we will have no officers assisting Ferguson.\u201d \n \n Dotson said in an interview this afternoon that he does not support the county police tactics in Ferguson, and has decided to keep his officers in the city. \n \n He said he made the decision earlier this week, long before the confrontation between police and protesters on Wednesday night that saw officers responding to the protests on armored vehicles carrying military weapons. \n \n \u201cMy gut told me what I was seeing were not tactics that I would use in the city and I would never put officers in situations that I would not do myself,\u201d he said. \n \n - Jeremy Kohler at 12:45 p.m. Thursday with updates \n \n \u2022\u2022\u2022 \n \n Hacker group claims it has name of cop who killed Brown \n \n The hacker group Anonymous has released the name of the person it says is the officer who shot and killed Michael Brown. \n \n The Post-Dispatch has not been able to verify the information. Police and the Ferguson mayor have both said the name Anonymous has released is wrong. \n \n Twitter suspended the account that Anonymous was using to release the information. \n \n Twitter suspended the account of the Anonymous-associated operative who released the name of the officer. The person or persons tweeting under the handle @TheAnonMessage confirmed via email that the account was suspended, \u201cfor practicing free speech,\u201d the person wrote. \n \n He said Anonymous indeed was responsible for the St. Louis County web crash. \n \n - David Hunn at 11:15 a.m. with updates. \n \n \u2022\u2022\u2022 \n \n St. Louis alderman released from jail \n \n St. Louis Alderman Antonio French emerged Thursday morning from a night in jail after his arrest at the Ferguson protests to say that the police officers' \"heavy-handed\" approach on the streets is making the situation worse. \n \n French said police pulled him from his car Wednesday night and arrested him. Police say he didn't listen to their orders to disperse. Police gave him no documentation that says why he was arrested. He was released about 7 a.m. today without having to post any bail. \n \n French said he should never have been locked up, nor should the dozen or so others at the jail overnight. \n \n \"Inside that jail is nothing but peacekeepers,\" he said. \"They rounded up the wrong people ... reverends, young people organizing the peace effort.\" \n \n Police arrested about a dozen people Wednesday night, including French and Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery and Huffington Post reporter Ryan Reilly. \n \n Police used tear gas and sonic cannons to disperse the crowds. Today, President Obama will mention the Ferguson troubles in a speech. Also today, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon is scheduled to visit Ferguson in the wake of the growing protests. \n \n \"The worsening situation in Ferguson is deeply troubling, and does not represent who we are as Missourians or as Americans,\u201d Nixon said in a statement. \n \n As French walked out of the Ferguson Jail this morning, he wore his signature oxford button-down shirt -- slightly wrinkled from sleeping in it on a jail cot, and with a burnt orange color on the shoulder from where a fellow inmate had wiped his eyes from the burning tear gas. \n \n French talked with reporters about his experience. He said he was near the burned-out QuikTrip on West Florissant Avenue at about 9 p.m. Wednesday when police in riot gear ordered protesters to disperse. Several hundred people were there. \n \n \"Police had just given a final warning to disperse and released smoke bombs, people scattered and ran,\" French said. \"Police started to move forward with riot gear and tear gas started to come.\" \n \n \"I moved away when it looked like they were throwing what I thought was tear gas ... it turned out to be smoke bombs,\" French added. \"I realized the best place (to be was in my) car with the windows rolled up. That's where I was.\" \n \n He said he was in car recording video of what was happening outside. When the line of police officers came to French's car door, an officer opened the door and pulled him out, French said. French asked why, and the officer told him, \"Because you didn't listen.\" \n \n When a reporter asked French today how he went from being in his car to being arrested, he said: \"They open your door and drag you out.\" \n \n \"They just rounded up anybody they could see,\" he said. \n \n He had no complaints about the way the officer treated him, other than how securely the officer wrapped his wrist with the plastic handcuffs. \n \n \"I don't think I was mistreated,\" he said. \"The roughest things were those zip ties ... pretty tight.\" \n \n He said he was treated well inside the jail and offered a honey bun at 6 a.m. for breakfast, which he declined. He was told he'd be held 24 hours on a charge of unlawful assembly, but then he was inexplicably released without bail or any paperwork at 7 a.m. \n \n French is in his first term as alderman of the 21st Ward in St. Louis. His ward includes the Mark Twain, Penrose and O'Fallon neighborhoods. After the fatal shooting of Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson on Saturday afternoon, French has been attending protests and rallies, posting updates on social media. \n \n French said he will continue to document the protests and police response as long as the protesters are on the streets. He wasn't able to post anything for the nine hours he was in jail because they took his phone from him. At 8 a.m., French said he was ready to log back in. \"I've gotta find a charger somewhere,\" he joked. \n \n He said he was also heading to an ATM to get cash to bail out two of his staffers who were arrested after being pulled from their cars. Police told his staffers, two women, that they were arrested for a noise violation, French said. \n \n \"In an American city, people are being tear-gassed and snipers are pointing rifles at them,\" he said. \"Everybody should be upset ... heavy-handed police approach is actually making the situation worse. \n \n \"Before they arrived heavy-handedly, it was a peaceful situation.\" \n \n French said the city is wrong to try to limit protests to daylight-only. \n \n \"We have a right to protest 24 hours a day,\" French said. \"Our constitutional rights don't expire at 9 p.m.\" \n \n - Kim Bell, 7:25 a.m. Thursday \n \n \u2022\u2022\u2022 \n \n Twitter hashtag calls for moment of silence to honor victims of police brutality \n \n The hashtag #NMOS14 has been gaining speed on Twitter.

For every reporter they arrest, every image they block, every citizen they censor, another will still write, photograph and speak.\u201d \n \n Later, the Associated Press Media Editors association and the National Association of Black Journalists also released a statement in partnership with ASNE on the same issue. \n \n \"The withholding of information by law enforcement, the unlawful detainment of journalists and the censoring of the unfolding story is unacceptable,\" said APME President Debra Adams Simmons. \"We join with ASNE in calling on the U.S. Department of Justice to protect the First Amendment rights of everyone involved.\" \n \n Two reporters were arrested Wednesday night while covering the situation in Ferguson.

The St. Louis County government website, the police website, parks and revenue are among those that weren't coming up this morning. \n \n A county source says they have limited access to external email and internet. \n \n A woman at the county executive's office said she was able to access the website internally this morning after 8 a.m. but would report the troubles for others trying to get on the websites to the county's IT staff.

Wednesday night, after two national reporters covering the Ferguson story were arrested while inside a McDonald's, on her Twitter account @ChiefExecBear, Clark Tweeted to her nearly 6,000 followers: \u201cREALLY???? Arresting visitors/news at McD?? This is not the STL I know and love. Stop! This behavior is absurd and unnecessary.\u201d \n \n Clark's other Tweets reference the worldwide spotlight now on the region, including this Tweet from Wednesday: \u201cThree conf. calls today & everyone asked 'what is going on in STL?' These aren't proud moments. Someone tell Ferg Police honesty matters!\u201d \n \n Chris Sommers, owner of the Pi Pizzeria chain in St. Louis, also has been active on social media throughout the week, mostly retweeting news accounts of the unfolding events in Ferguson on his Twitter account, @sommerscm, to his more than 800 followers. Sommers said the protests following Brown's death have been mishandled by authorities. \u201cIt's devastating to our town,\u201d said Sommers, who's opened six Pi restaurants in the region since 2008. \u201cMany of us have been working really hard to build our city back up, and the St. Louis County and Ferguson police are undoing that in a manner of days.\u201d \n \n Sommers has two new Pi restaurants opening in Miami and Cincinnati, and said the current unrest here and the attention it's garnering worldwide will have a negative impact the region's economy for a long time. \u201cIt's going to suffer,\u201d Sommers said. \u201cI'm grateful that our immediate expansion is not in the St. Louis area. I would certainly think twice about an investment here now. What's infuriating is a lack of leadership and the result of that is a devastation to the economy.\u201d \n \n Lisa Brown, 9:55 a.m. Thursday \n \n \u2022\u2022\u2022 \n \n Vigil planned tonight in St. Louis \n \n A vigil is planned in downtown St. Louis city this evening to commemorate Michael Brown and other victims of police-involved shootings. The National Moment of Silence vigil will be held at Luther Ely Smith Square, between the main Arch grounds and the Old Courthouse, said a representative with the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial. \n \n A local Twitter user, @TheMegaChloe, has been instrumental in organizing the vigil. Several similar vigils are planned for cities around the country, according to tweets using the hashtag #NMOS14. - Beth O'Malley at 10:30 a.m. \n \n \u2022\u2022\u2022 \n \n OUR EARLIER STORY \n \n Law enforcement officials on Wednesday asked for patience to allow the investigation into the shooting of Michael Brown to take its course as tension over the teenager\u2019s death continued for a fifth straight day. \n \n St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch said his office will take as much time as necessary to review circumstances that led a Ferguson police officer to fatally shoot the 18-year-old Brown on a street Saturday afternoon. \n \n \u201cThe timeline on this is there is no timeline,\u201d McCulloch told an afternoon news conference. \u201cWe will do this as expeditiously as possible. But we won\u2019t rush.\u201d \n \n Resisting pressure from street demonstrators and public officials for answers that show why the unnamed officer confronted Brown and a companion shortly after noon on Saturday, McCulloch said the details may not emerge until the process of collecting evidence and presenting it to the grand jury is complete. \n \n \u201cI know that\u2019s not the answer anybody wants to hear at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody wants to know what happened.\u201d \n \n McCulloch called the problem twofold. First, he said, ethical rules prevent prosecutors from disseminating the physical evidence. He also said he won\u2019t do anything to corrupt the integrity of the investigation. \n \n NAMING OFFICERS FAR FROM ROUTINE \n \n VOLUNTEERS CLEAN UP AFTER LOOTING \n \n MAYBE THE CLOSEST EYEWITNESS TO FATAL SHOOTING \n \n PEACEFUL DAYS, DEFIANT NIGHTS \n \n In response to a reporter\u2019s question, McCulloch said it will certainly take more than two weeks to complete the investigation. He offered no specific estimate of the timetable. He cited a heavy volume of information that is being gathered in the case. \n \n \u201cWe want to test the veracity and accuracy of anybody who comes to us,\u201d McCulloch said. \n \n McCulloch said a lot of information has come forward through social media, \u201csome of it good, some of it bad.\u201d \n \n He stressed that the medical examiner\u2019s report, 911 tapes and other investigative material will be withheld at this point. \n \n One new detail of Saturday\u2019s shooting did emerge Wednesday when Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson in another news conference said the officer who shot Brown suffered facial injuries and was taken to a hospital. \n \n Jackson also acknowledged that mending the strained relationship between his department and the African-American community is imperative for the city and region to move ahead following nearly a week of outrage, violence and looting. \n \n \u201cWe have always had real good relations with all of the neighborhood associations,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cApparently, there\u2019s been this undertow that now has bubbled to the surface, and it\u2019s our first priority to address it, to fix what\u2019s wrong.\u201d \n \n The first step, he added, is working with the community relations office on race relations that the U.S. Justice Department has dispatched to Ferguson. \n \n The chief defended the racial makeup of the Ferguson department. Three of the agency\u2019s 53 officers are African-American in a community where two-thirds of the population is black. \n \n Jackson said he has worked to improve the diversity of the police department, adding it is a \u201cconstant struggle to hire and retain personnel.\u201d \n \n In the past few years, Jackson said, he has tried not only to recruit but improve quality of life in the department, including pay levels, to retain officers longer. \n \n The comments from law enforcement in a week that has seen forums, prayer vigils and a clergy-led parade Wednesday that passed many of the looted West Florissant Avenue businesses did little to quell the outrage spawned by Brown\u2019s death. \n \n As has been the case since Monday, the parking lot of a QuikTrip looted and burned Sunday evening has been the epicenter of hostility between protesters and police. \n \n The animosity for the most part was verbal Wednesday until a thrown bottle prompted police to fire smoke bombs at the crowd shortly before 9 p.m. \n \n When police then ordered demonstrators to evacuate the area or face arrest the protesters responded that \u201cwe are not going anywhere.\u201d \n \n Police a short time later chased protesters into nearby neighborhoods after dispersing the crowd for the third straight night with tear gas grenades. \n \n On Wednesday, police also used piercing-sound sonic cannons to scatter the crowd. \n \n As they have since Saturday, demonstrators throughout the evening taunted and threatened police. \n \n \u201cIf I\u2019m going to go, I\u2019m taking one of you with me,\u201d warned one demonstrator. \n \n Another shouted, \u201cWe\u2019re not dogs, so what the hell you\u2019ve got those whipping sticks for? Because you want to whip us like dogs.\u201d \n \n A county police tactical operations armored vehicle was deployed at the demonstration site for most of the night. \n \n Protected by body armor, police sat atop the vehicle methodically fitting high-caliber automatic weapons into tripods which were then trained on the crowd. \n \n \u201cYou are being ordered to leave now!\u201d police announced frequently through a public address system. \u201cIf you don\u2019t leave peacefully there will be arrests.\u201d \n \n The crowd ignored the demand until the tear gas was fired. \n \n As of midnight there were reports of sporadic gunfire. \n \n At 2 a.m., several dozen police officers riding inside and on three armored tactical vehicles pulled up in front of the Ferguson police station. Forming a skirmish line, they faced the last of the night's protesters, a group of about 100 gathered across the street on the parking lot of the Andy Wurm Tire & Wheel shop. \n \n A booming voice from a police loudspeaker ordered the crowd to disperse. \n \n The protesters complied but not before some of them cursed the cops. \n \n But 2:15 a.m., a tense quiet had fallen over Ferguson. \n \n SHOOTING CHARGES \n \n Prosecutors filed felony charges Wednesday against a man shot by police in a confrontation earlier in the day near the scene of the protests. \n \n Esrail Britton, 19, was charged with second-degree assault on a law enforcement officer and armed criminal action. He remained hospitalized, and earlier in the day was reported to be in critical condition. \n \n Officials said they have two addresses for Britton, both of them vacant dwellings in the St. Louis area. \n \n The shooting occurred about 1 a.m. at West Florissant Avenue and Chambers Road, in an unincorporated area of St. Louis County, as county police responded to a report of four of five men with masks and shotguns in an area where shots were heard. \n \n ALDERMAN French, JOURNALISTS ARRESTED \n \n St. Louis Alderman Antonio French was among about 10 people arrested Wednesday night. \n \n French was being held at the Ferguson Police Department but no details of his arrest were being released. \n \n Wesley Lowery, a reporter with the Washington Post, was arrested Wednesday evening along with Ryan Reilly of the Huffington Post, according to a Twitter post by Lowery. \n \n He wrote that police came into the McDonald\u2019s on West Florissant where the two were working, and tried \u201cto kick everyone out.\u201d \n \n \u201cOfficers decided we weren\u2019t leaving McDonald\u2019s quickly enough, shouldn\u2019t have been taping them,\u201d he tweeted. \n \n \u201cOfficers slammed me into a fountain soda machine because I was confused about which door they were asking me to walk out of,\u201d he wrote. \n \n He said that he was detained, booked, \u201cgiven answers to no questions. Then just let out.\u201d \n \n Reilly tweeted that a SWAT team invaded the McDonald\u2019s where he was working and recharging his phone, and asked for identification when he took a photo. They tried to kick everyone out, he wrote. He wrote that he was \u201cassaulted\u201d by an officer. \n \n SCHOOL START DELAYED \n \n The continuing unrest forced the Ferguson-Florissant school district to postpone the start of school from today to Monday. \n \n \u201cIn order to allow additional time for the situation to stabilize and for all of our students and their families to resume normal routines, we will reschedule the first day of school,\u201d district officials said in a statement. \u201cWe believe that this change will help ensure a strong start to the new school year.\u201d \n \n Paul Hampel, Stephen Deere, Valerie Schremp Hahn, Joel Currier, Kim Bell, Koran Addo, Ken Leiser, Jessica Bock and Steve Giegerich of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report. \n \n \u2022\u2022\u2022 \n \n Tense moments between members of crowd \n \n After the bigger crowds dispersed, some members of the crowd began to fight among themselves. At one point, at about 11:15 p.m., about two dozen people stood around at Lang Drive and West Florissant Avenue, near the Quik Trip site. A German shepherd traipsed through the crowd, with a leash on, but with nobody holding it. People began shouting about the dog, and the owner eventually found the dog and took the leash. \n \n The owner appeared to be intoxicated, and about three or four men surrounded him, telling him to let his dog go. The man refused and tried to walk away. Suddenly, one of the men hit the man with the dog hard in the chest. Some from the crowd shouted, \u201cLet's shoot this dog and knock this guy out!\u201d \n \n The man with the dog started walking away, and the crowd shouted out. \n \n Police, who had returned to the original protest line closer to the gas station, arrived on the scene and trained a spotlight down Lang. Somebody picked up an unexploded sound canister and threw it towards officers, and the canister exploded, spewing smoke. Police got out of their patrol cars and ran, continuing their chase into the dark neighborhood. \n \n The crowd stood watching, holding their hands in the air. \n \n --Stephen Deere, 11:57 p.m. \n \n Police dispense tear gas into crowd \n \n Shortly after 9 p.m., police dispensed tear gas at the crowd standing on West Florissant Avenue. About 50 demonstrators stood in the middle of the street near the Quik Trip, with several hundred people on the side streets. \n \n After giving people several verbal warnings to leave the area or face arrest, somebody hurled a bottle at the police line. Police then threw more than a dozen sound canisters at the crowds. The canisters exploded close to people, emitted a loud boom and smoke and sparks. They made an ear-splitting noise. \n \n Some people picked up the canisters and threw them back at police. Then the police deployed tear gas. \n \n One young woman screamed to fleeing members of the crowd not to be cowards. \"We have to stand and fight here right now!\" she screamed. \n \n Police inched closer and closer to the crowd until they dispersed into side streets. The protesters were reduced to several small, scattered pockets, talking quietly among themselves. \n \n Some people had no way to get home. \n \n ----Paul Hampel and Stephen Deere, 9:20 p.m. \n \n \u2022\u2022\u2022 \n \n Body released to family \n \n Authorities released Michael Brown's body to his family on Wednesday.

Missouri's governor moved on Thursday to calm days of racially charged protests over the police shooting of an unarmed black teenager, naming an African-American captain of the Highway Patrol to oversee security in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson. \n \n Captain Ron Johnson, who grew up in Ferguson, told reporters he would take a new approach after complaints that police have used heavy-handed tactics, arresting dozens of protesters and using teargas and pepper pellets to break up crowds. \n \n Ferguson, a mostly black town of 21,000 with a predominantly white police force that has been accused of racial profiling in the past, was bracing for a fifth straight night of protests on Thursday after a police officer shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown last weekend. \n \n Since Sunday, there have been peaceful vigils and demonstrations - with hundreds of protesters holding their hands in the air and chanting \"hands up, don't shoot\" - as well as episodes of looting, vandalism and violence. \n \n U.S. President Barack Obama, seeking to defuse tensions in Ferguson, called on police to respect peaceful demonstrations. \n \n \"There is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting,\" Obama said. \n \n \"There's also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protesters or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights,\" he said in remarks broadcast from Edgartown, Massachusetts, near where he is vacationing with his family. \n \n The protests have cast a spotlight on racial tensions in greater St. Louis, where civil rights groups have complained in the past that police racially profiled blacks, arrested a disproportionate number of blacks and had racist hiring practices. \n \n Governor Jay Nixon praised Ferguson on Thursday for being a diverse, hard-working community, but he said, \"lately it has looked a little bit more like a war zone, and that is unacceptable.\" \n \n Police have pledged to do better but have also justified the tactics, saying they have responded to the threat of violence during protests. \n \n \"We are going to have a different approach,\" Johnson said at the news conference where Nixon announced his role in directing Ferguson's security. He said he would go to \"ground zero\" on Thursday evening, the area where Brown was killed and also where a convenience store was burned down on Sunday in riots. \n \n Additionally, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement that police had accepted an offer of technical assistance from the Justice Department \"to help conduct crowd control and maintain public safety without relying on unnecessarily extreme displays of force.\" \n \n The Justice Department, the FBI and the St. Louis County prosecutor's office are all investigating Brown's death. \n \n HANDS IN THE AIR \n \n Protesters have decried what they say is a lack of transparency by police investigating the incident - including the refusal to release the officer's name. And some have called for St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCullough to be removed from the case. \n \n Early on Thursday, a member of the Anonymous hacker activist collective tweeted the name of a person alleged to be the police officer who shot Brown. But police and other Anonymous tweeters said the activist had named the wrong person. \n \n Police said threats from cyber activists were one reason they continued to be reluctant to release the officer's name. But Nixon said on Thursday that authorities should be expeditious about identifying the officer. \n \n There is little clarity on what occurred during Saturday's incident. \n \n Police have said that Brown struggled with the officer who shot and killed him. The officer involved in the shooting was injured during the incident and was treated in a hospital for swelling on the side of his face, they said. \n \n But some witnesses have said that Brown held up his hands and was surrendering when he was shot multiple times in the head and chest. \n \n (Reporting by Nick Carey; Additional reporting by Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee, David Bailey in Minneapolis, Carey Gillam in Kansas City and Jeff Mason in Edgartown, Mass.; Writing by Fiona Ortiz; Editing by Eric Beech)",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n / Updated By Alastair Jamieson \n \n LONDON \u2013 A controversial four-lane highway will be constructed under Stonehenge, planners announced Thursday in an effort to solve a decades-old traffic problem at the ancient British monument. \n \n A new 1.8 mile tunnel would remove the sight and sound of traffic for visitors to the prehistoric landmark, England\u2019s Department for Transport said. \n \n The World Heritage Site is among Britain\u2019s top tourist attractions and pulls in in more than 1.3 million visitor annually. \n \n The busy A303 trunk road in Wiltshire, England runs right past Stonehenge.

The stretch of highway nearest Stonehenge is single-lane, creating a notorious bottleneck and prompting many drivers to slow down to get a look. \n \n Plans for a tunnel at the Wiltshire site were first made almost 30 years ago but have been repeatedly shelved amid concerns about the environmental impact. \n \n Campaign group Stonehenge Alliance says the latest scheme, which would carry two lanes in each direction, would do \"irreparable damage to the landscape\" and it wants a much longer tunnel that would minimize the road\u2019s impact. \n \n Supporters of the government plan include heritage charity, National Trust. Helen Ghosh, director general, said in a statement: \u201cI know there will be some sadness that people will no longer be able to see the stones from the road, but visitors will once again be able to hear the sounds of skylarks singing rather than the constant noise of traffic.\u201d \n \n She added: \u201cAfter many false starts and challenges, this does for the first time feel like a real opportunity to tackle the blight of the road that dominates the landscape of Stonehenge.\u201d \n \n The Department for Transport said the Stonehenge tunnel was part of a $2.45 billion program of investment in the region and would cut traffic congestion. A public consultation on the scheme will run until March 5. ||||| Visiting Stonehenge becomes ever harder. You have to book ahead as if it were a swanky West End show, endure a visitor centre when what you really want to do is commune with the mysterious past \u2013 and when you do finally get your chance to walk around (not among) the stones, you need to assiduously ignore the hum of traffic from the heavily congested nearby A303. \n \n Chris Grayling gives go-ahead to road tunnel under Stonehenge Read more \n \n That, at least, is going to change. The government has decided to go ahead with a tunnel that will take this very busy road underground for 1.8 miles, removing the horrible stream of honking traffic from the visible surroundings of Stonehenge, and so making it much easier to concentrate on the wonder of Europe\u2019s greatest neolithic monument. \n \n Archaeologists are understandably delighted... oh wait, they\u2019re up in arms. Campaigners claim the road project will wreck the extraordinarily rich and complex archaeology of the area. \u201cWe have recently started to realise that the standing stones are just a beginning,\u201d protests Dan Snow, president of the Council for British Archaeology. \u201cThey sit at the heart of the world\u2019s most significant and best-preserved stone age landscape. The government\u2019s plans endanger this unique site.\u201d \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Winter solstice celebrated at Stonehenge in 2016. Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images \n \n This is a battle between the aesthetic and the archaeological. The A303 really is a monstrous intrusion into the immediate landscape of Stonehenge. A tunnel will make the site more peaceful, more romantic, more emotionally powerful. It should therefore make it much easier to appreciate the grandeur of Stonehenge. How can that be a bad thing? \n \n It is true that modern research keeps expanding Stonehenge in time and space, until experts can see the stones just as the tip of an archaeological iceberg. One study has even explored the acoustic archaeology of the site. Above all, instead of seeing Stonehenge as an isolated stone structure in the middle of an empty Wiltshire plain, archaeology now conceptualises it as part of the \u201cStonehenge Landscape\u201d, a multilayered ceremonial space extending far beyond the stone circle itself and including everything from lost henges to barrow tombs. It seems this really was an incredibly important place in ancient times. \n \n But archaeologists are putting fashionable theories before the pressing need to make Stonehenge a better place to visit. It may not be just a stone circle \u2013 but it does include the world\u2019s most impressive stone circle, and it needs to better presented. Researching the past is important, but so is making it accessible to modern eyes. Stonehenge has been blighted by the A303 for too long. This and other modern intrusions make it impossible to see it as John Constable or Thomas Hardy did, as a bleak romantic marvel. \n \n \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Constable\u2019s painting Stonehenge, c.1835, which hangs in the V&A Museum, London. Photograph: Paul Robins/Bequeathed by Isabel Constable, daughter of the artist \n \n The very name Stonehenge suggests romantic bleakness, for it comes from Anglo-Saxon and means \u201changing stones\u201d. Medieval people must have thought it had a gallows-like darkness out there on Salisbury Plain. The chronicler Geoffrey of Monmouth attributed this strange marvel to the wizard Merlin. In Romantic art it is a remote secret, and in in Hardy\u2019s Tess of the d\u2019Urbervilles a place lonely enough for a fugitive to take refuge. \n \n The 20th century changed all that. Modern blights from busy roads to army manoeuvres to mass tourism have made it much harder to experience the mystery and magic of Stonehenge. \n \n These angry archaeologists can\u2019t see the stones for the sonar studies. It is actually not news that Stonehenge is part of a vast ancient landscape \u2013 the antiquarian William Stukeley observed as much in the 18th century. He published vivid drawings of such nearby monuments as the Cursus, a huge ceremonial earthwork. Yet the sculptural and architectural authority of Stonehenge itself, those silent yet eloquent stones, can touch us across time in a unique way. Putting the A303 underground will get us closer to this ancient power. ||||| Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The plan involves building a tunnel for the A303, which runs past the ancient monument \n \n A controversial plan for a road tunnel past Stonehenge has been finalised by the government. \n \n Campaigners claim the 1.8-mile (2.9 km) dual-carriageway tunnel will cause \"irreparable damage\" to the landscape. \n \n However, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said the plan will \"transform\" the A303, \"cutting congestion and improving journey times\". \n \n A public consultation to get the views of drivers and residents will run until 5 March. \n \n The busy A303 currently passes within a few hundred metres of the ancient monument. \n \n The tunnel forms part of a \u00a32bn government scheme to upgrade all remaining sections of the road between the M3 and M5. \n \n 'Time bomb' \n \n However, campaign group Stonehenge Alliance believes any tunnel shorter than 2.7-miles (4.3 km) would do \"irreparable damage to the landscape\". \n \n Chairman of Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust, Andy Rhind-Tutt, described the tunnel plan as a \"self-destructing time bomb\" which would \"do nothing\" for traffic problems in the area. \n \n In 2015, a Stonehenge Alliance petition calling for a longer tunnel gained 17,500 signatures. \n \n In a statement, the group said: \"The Alliance does not advocate new road building at Stonehenge, but accepts the need to improve the tranquillity and appearance of the World Heritage Site and its setting. \n \n \"If the government insists on widening the A303 by means of a tunnel, it must be sufficiently long to avoid any further damage to [Stonehenge] and its setting.\" \n \n Image caption Thousands of people have backed a campaign calling for a longer tunnel to protect the landscape \n \n English Heritage and the National Trust have also given their support to the option of \"the longest tunnel possible\". \n \n Highways England's Jim O'Sullivan said: \"Our plans for the A303 recognise the national importance of the route and these improvements will bring real benefit to the region and local communities. \n \n \"The public exhibitions will provide an excellent opportunity to explain further our plans and to hear feedback from stakeholders.\" \n \n However, a report by UNESCO and the International Council on Monuments and Sites has recognised the benefits of the project. \n \n Tunnel history \n \n Plans for a tunnel past the Stonehenge site have had a long and chequered history. \n \n Proposals for a bored tunnel were first mooted in 1995 but the government insisted on a \"cut and covered\" tunnel, which was unveiled in 1999. \n \n The plans for the 2.5-mile (4 km) tunnel was criticised by the National Trust and other groups who were concerned about possible damage to the site. \n \n In 2002, revised plans for a bored tunnel of 1.3 miles (2.1 km) were proposed as part of a wider scheme to upgrade the A303 to dual carriageway status \n \n Following a public inquiry, the tunnel scheme was withdrawn in 2005 by the Labour government, partly due to rising costs of construction, which had doubled to \u00a3470m. It was shelved for good in 2007. \n \n The idea resurfaced in 2014 when the Conservative MP for Salisbury, John Glen, said any attempt to make the A303 in to a dual carriageway must include protection for the World Heritage site. \n \n In December of that year the coalition government gave its support to the plan for a 1.8-mile tunnel near the monument. \n \n Congestion on the A303 \u00a31.4bn Proposed cost of Stonehenge tunnel 1.8 miles is the length of the proposed tunnel (2.9km) \n \n 9.6 sq m around Stonehenge is a World Heritage site (25 sq km) \n \n 33% of the route is single carriageway \n \n 84 years since the A-road opened PA \n \n Stonehenge is one of the Europe's most recognisable prehistoric monuments. \n \n The history of the Wiltshire site dates back 4,500 years and it is the only surviving lintelled stone circle in the world.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It could finally be tunnel time at Stonehenge. NBC News reports that the 1.3 million annual visitors to the famous landmark have been dealing with increasing traffic on a nearby highway for years. Officials first proposed a tunnel to cut down on noisy and unsightly traffic yards away on the A303 nearly 30 years ago, but it never materialized. Now the British government has finalized plans to build that tunnel, according to the BBC. The 1.8-mile tunnel would include four lanes and cost an estimated $1.7 billion. The secretary of England's Department of Transport says the tunnel will reduce traffic and travel times near Stonehenge. But the tunnel remains controversial, with Stonehenge fans weighing in on both sides. One supporter says tourists will \"once again be able to hear the sounds of skylarks\" instead of traffic. And UNESCO, which lists Stonehenge as a World Heritage Site, is in favor of the tunnel. But the Council for British Archaeology is against it, the Guardian reports. The council's president says the area around Stonehenge is the \"world's most significant and best-preserved stone-age landscape.\" That's why the Stonehenge Alliance also opposes the current tunnel plan.

    "document": "Changing Channels: YouTube Will Pull the Plug on at Least 60 Percent of Its Programming Deals \n \n YouTube has helped fund about 160 \u201cchannels\u201d as part of a new strategy to make the video site more TV-like. \n \n And just like the TV world, YouTube isn\u2019t going to renew all of last season\u2019s programs. \n \n This week, Google\u2019s video site will start offering new contracts to some of the channel programmers/creators it signed up in the last year. But not all of them: YouTube figures it will end up re-investing in up to 40 percent of its original channels by the time the renewal process is done. \n \n YouTube will handle renewals in batches, starting with the first set of channels that launched in January of this year. The new deals will largely mirror the ones YouTube set up last year, where the programmers got advances of up to $5 million to produce videos that would live exclusively on the site for more than a year. \n \n Channels that don\u2019t get new deals won\u2019t get kicked off YouTube, and executives say they hope content makers will continue producing stuff for the site. In the cases where YouTube hasn\u2019t recouped its initial programming outlay, the site will continue to collect 100 percent of any revenue generated by the videos it paid for. \n \n What determines who makes the cut? Jamie Byrne, YouTube\u2019s director of content strategy, says the site is most concerned about engagement \u2014 primarily the total \u201cwatch time\u201d a channel has generated \u2014 and cost \u2014 how efficient programmers have been with their programming budget. \n \n Which means you can get a good sense of the most likely renewal candidates by looking at rankings published by Advertising Age and Deadline. But since those lists only measure video views, it\u2019s possible that some channels with relatively high ratings may not get new deals. \n \n Byrne and his boss Robert Kyncl are also not paying much attention to the channels\u2019 financial performance \u2014 a tacit acknowledgement that advertising for the channels remains a work in progress. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019ve had some really great response from the advertiser community. As we continue to talk to advertisers and marketers, there\u2019s a real sense that they\u2019re looking at YouTube differently,\u201d Byrne says. \u201cBut as we look at this initiative, we are taking the long view here. It\u2019s not necessarily about immediate results.\u201d ||||| Nearly a year after YouTube sprinkled $100 million across the online video ecosystem to create more than a hundred new \"channels,\" it's doubling down. \n \n Google's video giant will provide a second round of funding to 30% to 40% of its original partners and will start notifying those getting more investment in the next few weeks. \"Our biggest objective was to kick-start the ecosystem, to bring in great creators, to deepen our relationships with advertisers and to grow viewership,\" said Global Head of Content Strategy Jamie Byrne. \n \n YouTube: Its top 25 channels now average more than a million views a week. \n \n In the first round, YouTube took a scattershot approach, funding 100 concepts from a wide variety of producers as well as a lot of mainstream celebrities. A year later, YouTube has a better feel for what worked, namely programming that appeals to a young demographic in genres like humor, music, cars and sports. \n \n What didn't work? A celebrity name attached wasn't enough. Nor was simply creating content--however good it might be--and posting it to a channel. While channels failed for a lot of reasons, the ones that are succeeding have one common characteristic: they make building the audience as big a priority as creating content. \n \n \"Celebrity alone isn't enough to drive it,\" said Courtney Holt, COO of Maker Studios, which launched Tutele, Mom's View and the coming Maker Music. \"You need to have a commitment to the platform, to understand how to build your audience.\" \n \n The top 25 new channels now average more than a million views a week and the top 33 have more than 100,000 subscribers, a key indicator of repeat viewing. \n \n The new investments will be roughly equivalent to the first; most channels received funding in the $1 million to $5 million range in exchange for producing a year of content that YouTube could sell exclusively. That's in addition to the 60 new channels funded last month. \n \n \"We looked at viewership they've been able to achieve, the cost of the content, and from that we are able to determine the channels that are delivering the best return on our invesmtnent,\" Mr. Byrne said. \n \n A condition of the deals is that the producers pay back YouTube's investment before they can sell their own ads. But that 's been tough for most producers\u2014for every million invested, they'd have to rack up 50 million views at a healthy $20 CPM. Even successful programmers reached by Ad Age didn't seem to know if they'd recouped, since YouTube hasn't been communicating that information. \n \n Those channels that don't get a second round will have to make the call whether to continue and recoup YouTube's first investment, or quietly go away. \n \n But beyond the success of individual channels, YouTube's goal is to change perception among content creators and advertisers. \"Everyone I talk to in the entertainment industry and a lot of people in the ad industry see YouTube in a different light than they did a year ago,\" said Allen Debevoise, CEO of Machinima. \n \n A passel of big advertisers took a flier on YouTube's strategy at the outset, including Unilever, P&G;, Dodge, Gillette and Toyota, but it's hard to know how much additional revenue has resulted from the channels. \n \n Geico did its first upfront deal with YouTube for WIGS, a channel targeting women 25 to 48. While Geico had spent on YouTube before, the existence of a serialized, TV-like show made an upfront investment appealing. \"WIGS was an opportunity where it was valuable to buy it upfront and to consider it in that manner,\" said Mary Shirley, VP at Horizon Media, which represents Geico. \n \n Ad deals that included the channels had a $3 million minimum, according to sources, but only a fraction of that was spent on the channels themselves, and the rest spread across YouTube. Packages could include video ads as well as the YouTube homepage. \n \n \"We believe in the strategy,\" said John McCarus, senior VP-branded entertainment at Digitas. \"We have a handful of clients invested [in YouTube] and with this new round, we expect that to go up.\" \n \n The bigger challenge for YouTube is to get people watching longer, which allows YouTube to compete for TV ad budgets. Overall time spent per viewer on YouTube has grown nearly 60% in the past year from just under three hours a month in September 2011 to four hours, according to Nielsen. Mr. Byrne said YouTube is averaging 4 billion hours of viewing time a month compared to 3 billion a year ago. \n \n While YouTube is touching TV ad budgets, it has a long way to go to match that amount of time people spend in front of the tube. TV viewers watch more video in one day (4 hours, 38 minutes) than YouTube viewers do in a month. \n \n Perhaps the biggest change is that of YouTube, and by extension Google, as a funding source for programming. \n \n \"A year ago I think the premium content conversation was about iTunes, Hulu, Netflix, MSN and Yahoo,\" said Brian Bedol, CEO of Bedrocket, which manages four funded channels: Network A, Official Comedy, Look and KickTV. \"I don't think premium producers were thinking about producing original content for YouTube.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 YouTube channels are facing a reckoning: As it seeks to make the site more television-like, Google is launching a second round of investments in YouTube channels\u2014but only 30% to 40% are likely to get a new installment of cash, an exec tells Advertising Age. At the moment, YouTube has 160 channels. But a year after beginning the funding process, the site now has a clearer sense of which ones are on the road to success. The new funding will be based on viewership hours, as opposed to number of views or how much cash a channel is generating, Fast Company notes. \"Our biggest objective was to kick-start the ecosystem, to bring in great creators, to deepen our relationships with advertisers and to grow viewership,\" says content exec Jamie Byrne, who's helming the process. If channels don't get funding, it's not the end: They can stick around, and YouTube bosses are hoping content makers will keep at it, AllThingsD reports. Channels that do get funding are looking at similar figures to those in the first round of investment: between $1 million and $5 million. It's a tough gig for the channel's producers, notes Ad Age: Before they start selling their own ads, they have to pay back YouTube's investment.",

(AP Photo/J.

The measure, approved by voice votes in near-empty chambers, now goes to the White House. \n \n Trump has promised to sign the two-week extension to allow for ceremonies this week honoring former President George H.W. Bush, who died Nov. 30. But he wants the next funding package to include at least $5 billion for his proposed wall, something Democrats have rejected. Trump is set to meet Tuesday at the White House with Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. \n \n In a tweet late Thursday, Trump warned of the potential for \"Big danger\" at the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona, demanding, \"Nancy and Chuck must approve Boarder Security and the Wall!\" \n \n Pelosi, who is seeking to become House speaker in January, said the lame-duck Congress should now pass a half-dozen government funding bills that key committees have already agreed on, along with a separate measure funding the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the border. Funding for the homeland agency should address border security and does not necessarily include a wall, Pelosi said. \n \n Most Democrats consider the wall \"immoral, ineffective and expensive,\" Pelosi said, noting that Trump promised during the 2016 campaign that Mexico would pay for it, an idea Mexican leaders have repeatedly rejected. \n \n Even if Mexico did pay for the wall, \"it's immoral still,\" Pelosi said. \n \n Protecting borders \"is a responsibility we honor, but we do so by honoring our values as well,\" she added. \n \n Schumer said Thursday that a bipartisan Senate plan for $1.6 billion in border security funding does not include money for the 30-foot-high (9-meter-high) concrete wall Trump has envisioned. The money \"can only be used for fencing\" and technology that experts say is appropriate and makes sense as a security feature, Schumer said. \n \n If Republicans object to the proposal because of pressure from Trump, Schumer said lawmakers should follow Pelosi's advice and approve six appropriations bills and a separate measure extending current funding for Homeland Security. \n \n Either option would avert a partial government shutdown, which lawmakers from both parties oppose, he said. \n \n \"The one and only way we approach a shutdown is if President Trump refuses both of our proposals and demands $5 billion or more for a border wall,\" Schumer said. He called the wall \"a nonstarter\" for Democrats, who face increasing pressure from outside groups and liberal lawmakers to resist Trump's continued push for the barrier, which Trump says is needed to stop an \"invasion\" of Central American migrants and others from crossing into the country illegally. \n \n Schumer called the spat over the wall unnecessary, noting that the administration has not spent more than $1 billion approved for border security in the budget year that ended Sept. 30. \"The idea that they haven't spent last year's money and they're demanding such a huge amount this year makes no sense at all,\" he said. \n \n Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby said he prefers to include Homeland Security in an omnibus package containing seven unresolved spending bills for the current budget year. \n \n \"I believe the best route is to keep all seven together and pass them,\" the Alabama Republican told reporters Thursday. Lawmakers have \"made a lot of progress\" in recent weeks on the seven spending bills. \"I'd like to conclude it,'\" he said. \n \n Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, a member of Republican leadership, said the key question is whether Trump will sign a bill without funding for the wall. \n \n \"It doesn't matter how much appetite there is for a shutdown anywhere else, if he is willing to have a shutdown over this issue,\" Blunt said. \"He has given every indication that he would.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Alan Fram and Padmananda Rama contributed to this story. ||||| Tweet with a location \n \n You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

As the rest of the \u201cToday\u201d anchors came on set to toast her, Kelly offered the assemblage mimosas, meant to represent a transition between the wake-you-up coffee served on the show\u2019s first two hours and the alcohol consumed in its last. But there was no talk of current events: No reference to the devastation in Puerto Rico, or the protests that took place over the weekend across the nation\u2019s various NFL games. \n \n Kelly has long harbored ambitions of filling in the space in the TV-news business once occupied by Barbara Walters or Oprah Winfrey. \u201cDiane Sawyer left her anchor role. Oprah has moved to the OWN network and is doing a different thing now. So why not me?\u201d she told Variety during an interview in 2015. \n \n On Monday, she dove into the role, hosting a multi-segment visit with the cast of \u201cWill & Grace,\u201d the popular NBC sitcom that is getting a reboot this season. She bantered with the rest of the \u201cToday\u201d crew in a taped segment that had Kelly biking to work with Al Roker, and getting advice from Kathie Lee Gifford (\u201cBe authentic!\u201d) as she sat in the makeup chair. The show ended with a long field piece that had Kelly journey to the Windy City to meet a 77-year-old Chicago nun who was working diligently to improve a tough neighborhood. Sister Donna Liette and some of her supporters also joined Kelly in the studio. The title of the segment, \u201cSettle For More,\u201d is borrowed from Kelly\u2019s recent memoir, and looks as if it might be a regular feature on the show about people trying to improve their situation in life. \u201cIf you want change, you must seek it,\u201d Kelly told the crowd. \n \n NBC managed to weave promotional support from advertisers into the opening program \u2013 much like Oprah Winfrey did over the years. And while there was no mass giveaway of new cars to the in-studio crowd, as Winfrey did in 2004 when she gave free Pontiacs to more than 250 audience members, Kelly was able to offer one man a free trip to California to see a \u201cWill & Grace\u201d taping, courtesy of United Airlines. Coldwell Banker and Ace Hardware coughed up checks on stage to help Sister Liette continue her work. Unilever and General Mills were among the sponsors running multiple commercials during Kelly\u2019s debut. \n \n Daytime TV is notoriously difficult, and reliable operatives including Anderson Cooper, Katie Couric and Meredith Vieira have faced headwinds in their attempts to launch programs similar to Kelly\u2019s. NBC is clearly hoping the force of her personality and an inspirational backstory lend the host an edge \u2013 not the polarizing kind \u2013 with a broader audience that it was reaching with the previous inhabitant of the 9 a.m. timeslot. \n \n Will Kelly be able to maintain the lighter, inspirational tone of her debut in a swirling news cycle that seems utterly consumed with politics and cultural clashes? Will she want to bring her hard-news chops to bear now and again? The magic of a morning program is that it always has another broadcast waiting in the wings that might allow its host to try those ideas out. ||||| Kelly's much-anticipated new show, 'Megyn Kelly Today,' debuted Monday. \n \n Megyn Kelly, in a series of prelaunch interviews, has been very clear about the show she wants to run every day at 9 a.m. on NBC \u2014 one that's light on politics but heavy on inspiration and fun. She followed through on that early vision with the Monday morning launch of Megyn Kelly Today, which replaces the 9 a.m. hour of Today. \n \n \"As you heard, we have the entire cast of Will & Grace live, along with the show creator,\" Kelly told her live studio audience. \"And then we'll be dissecting the latest tweet from President Trump! Oh, wait! We will not be doing that. The truth is, I\u2019m kind of done with politics for now. I know. You know why, right? We all felt it, it's everywhere. And it's just gotten so dark.\" \n \n The first episode of the show felt like something of a coming-out party for the new, warmer Kelly. \n \n Her mother was in attendance, as was her husband, who came out from the audience and gave her a bouquet of roses. Kelly said her husband, unlike her, is \"not a TV person\" and \"likes his privacy.\" \n \n Kelly began the show by talking about her background and telling the story of losing her father to a heart attack at the age of 15. \"We didn't have a lot of money, but we did have a lot of love and a ton of honesty,\" the former Fox News anchor said. \n \n Kelly also received a very warm welcome from the entire Today show family. In a taped segment, she rode a tandem bike to work with Al Roker and cooked an omelet with Matt Lauer, who earnestly seemed excited to have Kelly as a colleague. \"I wish you success, honey,\" 10 a.m. co-host Kathie Lee Gifford told her. \"Mostly, I wish you joy.\" \n \n Later, the cast of Today came out and held a mimosa toast to Kelly, who had said in a New York Times story last week that \"if you had to put a drink on my show, it would be a mimosa.\" Lauer led the toast, and said, \"Here's the newest addition to our family. Here's to many happy mornings. Here's to Megyn Kelly Today.\" \n \n Kelly interviewed the entire cast of the rebooted NBC show Will & Grace, and, like a good morning show host, asked at many points, \"What did that feel like?\" In another dose of corporate synergy, Kelly will have the cast of This Is Us on Tuesday morning's show. ||||| Megyn Kelly has officially made her morning show debut! \n \n On Monday, the former Fox News anchor debuted Megyn Kelly Today, which occupies the NBC morning show\u2019s third hour. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m so excited,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m also a little nervous!\u201d \n \n \u201cWe\u2019ll be dissecting the latest tweet from President Trump \u2014 oh no, we will not be doing that,\u201d she said. \u201cThe truth is, I am kind of done with politics for now.\u201d \n \n Kelly, 46, encouraged her live studio audience in New York City to \u201chave a laugh with us, a smile, and sometimes a tear\u201d as she celebrated the show\u2019s launch day, getting emotional as she recalled her father dying of a sudden heart attack in their family home when she was 15 years old, just 10 days before Christmas \u2014 \u201cthe single most devastating event of my lifetime,\u201d as she called it. \n \n Kelly \u2014 whose mother was in the audience \u2014 said her goal at Megyn Kelly Today is to \u201cdeliver hope and optimism, and to have fun.\u201d \n \n Kelly encouraged her audience to ask questions, informing them that every morning would begin with a dialogue between the host and the studio audience. \n \n RELATED: Megyn Kelly Left Fox So She Could Watch Her Kids Grow Up \u2014 \u2018I Hadn\u2019t Tucked Them Into Bed on a Weeknight in 3 Years\u2019 \n \n One audience member asked Kelly, who previously hosted The Kelly File on Fox News before leaving the network in January for a diverse new role at NBC, what has been her biggest joy \u2014 and biggest challenge \u2014 in transitioning from evening to morning television. \n \n \u201cThe biggest challenge by far is the alarm clock,\u201d Kelly joked. \u201cMy biggest joy has been so far just all of it \u2014 I mean honestly, all of it. Professionally, I feel fulfilled, personally, I\u2019ve been having dinner with my husband and my kids every night.\u201d \n \n One minute to air here in Studio 6A! #MegynToday pic.twitter.com/udDcWXfv9b \u2014 Megyn Kelly TODAY (@MegynTODAY) September 25, 2017 \n \n Kelly\u2019s husband Douglas Brunt then made a surprise appearance, gifting his wife of 11 years with a bouquet of red roses. \n \n \u201cYou\u2019ve already made us all laugh and cry,\u201d he said as the two embraced. \u201cCongratulations!\u201d \n \n \u201cThat is so sweet, because he is not a TV person,\u201d said Kelly after he exited the stage. \u201cDoug, unlike me, likes his privacy!\u201d \n \n Earlier this month, Kelly told PEOPLE she\u2019s been \u201chaving so much fun [at NBC] it\u2019s almost not right.\u201d \n \n \u201cI\u2019ve been having a great time,\u201d she said. \u201cJust today in the audience, there were two people up front who were die-hard Fox viewers and remain die-hard Fox viewers and used to watch me every night on The Kelly File. They were so sweet. They said: \u2018Oh we miss you, we miss you.\u2019 The woman held my arm and said, \u2018You seem so happy,\u2019 and I am. She saw it and I feel it and it\u2019s just been rewarding.\u201d \n \n Megyn Kelly Today airs weekdays on NBC (check local listings). ||||| Megyn Kelly launched her daytime makeover on Monday with \"Megyn Kelly Today,\" conspicuously trying to reintroduce herself in the mold of Oprah Winfrey or Ellen DeGeneres -- complete with a caffeinated, cheering studio audience -- while establishing distance from her time as a Fox News anchor. \n \n It's absurdly early, of course, to draw any conclusions about the efficacy of the Kelly experiment. Still, after tepid marks for her prime time newsmagazine and now her addition to \"Today,\" it's worth considering that NBC News brass leapt at the opportunity to snag a high-profile news star without having fully thought through how best to deploy her. \n \n Related: Megyn Kelly turns to daytime for a shot at her own 'Oprah effect' \n \n Wasting no time, Kelly opened the show by essentially seeking to reintroduce herself in this new role, complete with a mission statement and biography, which included discussing the sudden death of her father when she was a teenager. \n \n \"The truth is I am kind of done with politics for now,\" she stated, citing the show's objective as providing the audience a place to share \"a laugh with us, a smile, sometimes a tear, and maybe a little hope to start your day.\" \n \n Given that she was best-known for combatively grilling guests (HBO's John Oliver provided a montage on Sunday) before her run-ins with then-candidate Donald Trump, hope is certainly a change for Kelly. But there she was mounting a charm offensive -- fielding questions from the audience, receiving flowers from her husband and warmly yukking it up with the cast and producers of \"Will & Grace,\" in an interview that wouldn't have looked out of place on any other daytime talk show or \"Access Hollywood.\" \n \n Related: Megyn Kelly makes the case for Alex Jones interview \n \n The same tone characterized a taped piece in which the \"Today\" team introduced Kelly to her new gig, which simply felt like a hurried attempt to soften the image of the franchise's newest host by adding her to NBC's morning family. \n \n Kelly closed with \"Settle for More,\" a segment designed to provide moments of hope and uplift -- the premiere's focus was a Chicago nun, who received some lovely gifts from sponsors -- but which simultaneously promotes her book. \n \n Kelly told the New York Times that the morning program is \"the show that I was born to do. This is what I was meant to do.\" That sense of mission, of purpose, would only seem to ratchet up the self-imposed pressure, as if much more was needed given NBC's high-stakes investment in her. \n \n Kelly is a polished interviewer. Yet whatever her interests and concerns about psychic health, it's at best questionable to introduce a show that so consciously seeks to create space between itself and serious news at a moment when there's such an abundance of it. \n \n In the aforementioned taped segment, which was followed by a welcoming toast from the \"Today\" crew, Kelly asked Kathie Lee Gifford for the secret to success in daytime. Her answer: \"Being authentic.\" \n \n Based on first impressions, Kelly is working awfully hard at being herself. And as they say in TV, if she can fake that, the rest should be easy. ||||| CLOSE \u201cI\u2019m so excited; I\u2019m also a little nervous,\u201d she admits as her new show, Megyn Kelly TODAY, premieres. She tells the live studio audience \u201cI\u2019m kind of done with politics for now,\u201d talks about her family and describes events that have shaped her. NBC News\u2019 Megyn Kelly TODAY \n \n Former Fox News host Megyn Kelly prepares for her morning debut on NBC's 'Megyn Kelly Today.' (Photo: Peter Kramer, NBC) \n \n Megyn Kelly is \"done with politics for now.\" \n \n The host opened Monday's inaugural episode of Megyn Kelly Today, the 9 a.m. hour of NBC's Today show, with that declarative statement. She noted that politics are everywhere, infused into every facet of our lives, and her new morning show would be far more focused on \"fun.\" \n \n It was a bit of necessary rebranding for the former Fox News anchor, who made her name diving into politics headfirst on the cable news channel, to enter the more lifestyle-focused world of morning TV. \n \n Minus politics, Monday's premiere was a blend of personal stories from Kelly, an audience Q&A, celebrity interviews and an \"inspirational\" field piece to close out the hour. \n \n More: 'Megyn Kelly Today': 'It's not going to be the Trump channel,' she promises \n \n The combination is tricky, and the first episode was a bit awkward. Like any new series, Megyn has some growing pains, and that was apparent in missed cues, clumsy seating arrangements and some stiffness from Kelly, who, whether because of nervousness or her attempts to develop a new tone, speaks with a strange cadence. \n \n And even an hour of the Today show cannot divorce itself from politics entirely. Her first guests were the cast and creators of NBC's returning Will & Grace, which, as Kelly repeatedly explained, was a groundbreaking show for LGBTQ representation on television. Kelly focused on the impact the series had on that community, except she only mentioned \"gays and lesbians,\" and, in an ill-timed joke that didn't land, asked a superfan in the audience, \"Is it true you became a lawyer and gay because of Will & Grace\"? \n \n Kelly also devoted a segment to an elderly nun working against gun violence on the south side of Chicago, an area that Kelly called \"like a war zone.\" Chicago's gun violence is another issue that's been politicized, particularly by President Trump, but her focus is on the feel-good aspect of the nun's \"Peace Garden,\" and her efforts to bring the mothers of violence victims and perpetrators together. While that serves its own purpose, it doesn't make the issue entirely apolitical. \n \n That, perhaps, is the biggest hurdle. She can say that she's done with politics, but the subject is (by her own admission) everywhere, and side-stepping it won't make it go away. The show will get better at staging and timing as it goes on, but a purpose is something harder to refine. \n \n There's a difference between choosing to focus on lifestyle and entertainment over political news, and ignoring the fact that politics exist in everyday issues. Megyn Kelly Today would do well to strike a better balance. \n \n Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2yoaoHg",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Former Fox News host Megyn Kelly made her debut Monday as a morning-TV host, declaring that she's \"kind of done with politics for now\" and instead focusing on more lighthearted fare, reports Variety. (See video here.) Kelly is hosting the 9am slot of the Today show on NBC, and Monday's show included the cast of the rebooted Will & Grace and a feature on a nun fighting gun violence in Chicago. So how did show No. 1 go? A sampling of reviews: Warm and fuzzy: Episode No. 1 \"felt like something of a coming-out party for the new, warmer Kelly,\" writes Jeremy Barr at the Hollywood Reporter. Especially when her husband emerged to give her flowers. Kelly also spoke emotionally about the death of her father when she was a teenager, notes People. Better balance? At USA Today, Kelly Lawler writes that the episode was a \"bit awkward\" as Kelly, who displayed \"some stiffness\" at times, transitioned into her new role. \"There's a difference between choosing to focus on lifestyle and entertainment over political news, and ignoring the fact that politics exist in everyday issues,\" she writes. \"Megyn Kelly Today would do well to strike a better balance.\" Questionable strategy: Brian Lowry at CNN also found the debut a little awkward. He cautions that it's too early to draw conclusions, but writes that it seems NBC landed Kelly without a clear sense of how to make use of her talents. What's more, \"it's at best questionable to introduce a show that so consciously seeks to create space between itself and serious news at a moment when there's such an abundance of it.\" Harsh take: At the Washington Post, Hank Steuver delivers a particularly negative review. \"The debut was like watching a network try to assemble its own Bride of Frankenstein, using parts of Ellen DeGeneres, Kelly Ripa and whatever else it can find,\" he writes. Kelly \"moved stiffly\" and \"interviewed people nervously and so awkwardly that they were cowed into giving monosyllabic answers. She also never missed an opportunity to talk about herself.\" Ouch.",

    "document": "I remember conversations with him when he was engaged in what may have been his greatest coup: helping free Hillary Clinton from the confines of the East Wing and converting her into a successful Senate candidate in New York. \n \n The number of people who were determined to keep that from happening were legion, both in Washington and New York. But Rangel knew them all, and he knew how to get around them - by co-opting or by mowing them down, whatever was required. And he loved every minute of this game - which he played for unselfish purposes, not to expand his own influence. \n \n He and Rosty had the same view of the hometown patronage games that brought them down. They wanted the perks that went with their positions of power. But they used them more often to help others along than for themselves, and they weren't greedy.

Steny Hoyer had challenged Rep. Nancy Pelosi for the top leadership post in the House of Representatives. In fact, the two once ran against each other for minority whip, the No. 2 post. ||||| Charlie Rangel stood, stony-faced, in the well of the House. His feet planted wide, his hands crossed over his fly, the 80-year-old lawmaker awaited the rebuke of his peers. \n \n On Thursday evening, for the first time in 27 years, the speaker read aloud the resolution of reproach. \"By its adoption of House Resolution 1737, the House is resolved that representative Charles Rangel of New York be censured,\" Nancy Pelosi read, calling on the fallen chairman of the Ways and Means committee to pay the taxes he owes. Rangel, staring back at the speaker, swallowed hard. \n \n After the ritual of public humiliation, the Harlem Democrat's friends came with outstretched arms to console him, but Rangel brushed them off, instead requesting permission to address the House. \n \n The disgraced lawmaker, defiant even in his moment of shame, scolded his accusers for treating him worse than \"those that in the past have done far more harm to the reputation of this body than I.\" \n \n Rangel then went downstairs to offer more defiance at a news conference. \"I leave here knowing that everyone knows I'm an honest guy,\" he proclaimed, accusing his colleagues of a \"very, very, very political vote.\" The freshly censured legislator even offered a suggestion for newspaper headlines: \"Rangel found not guilty of corruption and self dealing.\" \n \n Sorry, Charlie: That's not going to happen. But if it's any consolation, Rangel should know that however harmed he was by the censure, the entity that was really disgraced was Congress itself. This is because Rangel's two-year battle with the House ethics committee exposed the woeful state of lawmakers' abilities to police their own. \n \n The rules governing members' behavior were proven to be so lax as to be irrelevant. The vast majority of transgressors are never punished - Rangel was only because he himself asked the ethics committee to investigate some of the allegations against him. \n \n To be sure, Rangel deserved punishment for his wrongs, which included failing to pay taxes on his Dominican beach home and improperly using his office for charitable fundraising. But in the 30 minutes allotted to him for his defense on the House floor Thursday evening, Rangel and his friends made a compelling case that he was being punished for doing things that lawmakers do routinely. \n \n \"The only examples of anybody sanctioned for tax matters in this House in the history of the United States have been those who didn't pay taxes on bribes they received,\" argued Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), in Rangel's defense. Several members had a chuckle over their laxity. \n \n \"Far more serious ethical lapses than Mr. Rangel's have not met with censure,\" seconded Rep. Lynn Woolsey (D-Calif.). \n \n And Rep. Peter King (N.Y.), one of the only Republicans to oppose censure for Rangel, implored his colleagues to \"step back\" and reconsider. \"Let us apply the same standard of justice to Charlie Rangel that has been applied to everyone else, and that all of us would want applied to ourselves.\" \n \n Which is to say: a very lenient standard.",

    "document": "Looking for news you can trust? \n \n Subscribe to our free newsletters. \n \n Earlier this year, Mitt Romney nearly landed in a politically perilous controversy when the Huffington Post reported that in 1999 the GOP presidential candidate had been part of an investment group that invested $75 million in Stericycle, a medical-waste disposal firm that has been attacked by anti-abortion groups for disposing aborted fetuses collected from family planning clinics. Coming during the heat of the GOP primaries, as Romney tried to sell South Carolina Republicans on his pro-life bona fides, the revelation had the potential to damage the candidate\u2019s reputation among values voters already suspicious of his shifting position on abortion. \n \n But Bain Capital, the private equity firm Romney founded, tamped down the controversy. The company said Romney left the firm in February 1999 to run the troubled 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City and likely had nothing to with the deal. The matter never became a campaign issue. But documents filed by Bain and Stericycle with the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2014and obtained by Mother Jones\u2014list Romney as an active participant in the investment. And this deal helped Stericycle, a company with a poor safety record, grow, while yielding tens of millions of dollars in profits for Romney and his partners. The documents\u2014one of which was signed by Romney\u2014also contradict the official account of Romney\u2019s exit from Bain. \n \n The Stericycle deal\u2014the abortion connection aside\u2014is relevant because of questions regarding the timing of Romney\u2019s departure from the private equity firm he founded. Responding to a recent Washington Post story reporting that Bain-acquired companies outsourced jobs, the Romney campaign insisted that Romney exited Bain in February 1999, a month or more before Bain took over two of the companies named in the Post\u2018s article. The SEC documents undercut that defense, indicating that Romney still played a role in Bain investments until at least the end of 1999. \n \n Here\u2019s what happened with Stericycle. In November 1999, Bain Capital and Madison Dearborn Partners, a Chicago-based private equity firm, filed with the SEC a Schedule 13D, which lists owners of publicly traded companies, noting that they had jointly purchased $75 million worth of shares in Stericycle, a fast-growing player in the medical-waste industry. (That April, Stericycle had announced plans to buy the medical-waste businesses of Browning Ferris Industries and Allied Waste Industries.) The SEC filing lists assorted Bain-related entities that were part of the deal, including Bain Capital (BCI), Bain Capital Partners VI (BCP VI), Sankaty High Yield Asset Investors (a Bermuda-based Bain affiliate), and Brookside Capital Investors (a Bain offshoot). And it notes that Romney was the \u201csole shareholder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of BCI, BCP VI Inc., Brookside Inc. and Sankaty Ltd.\u201d \n \n The document also states that Romney \u201cmay be deemed to share voting and dispositive power with respect to\u201d 2,116,588 shares of common stock in Stericycle \u201cin his capacity as sole shareholder\u201d of the Bain entities that invested in the company. That was about 11 percent of the outstanding shares of common stock. (The whole $75 million investment won Bain, Romney, and their partners 22.64 percent of the firm\u2019s stock\u2014the largest bloc among the firm\u2019s owners.) The original copy of the filing was signed by Romney. \n \n Another SEC document filed November 30, 1999, by Stericycle also names Romney as an individual who holds \u201cvoting and dispositive power\u201d with respect to the stock owned by Bain. If Romney had fully retired from the private equity firm he founded, why would he be the only Bain executive named as the person in control of this large amount of Stericycle stock? \n \n The documents\u2014one of which was signed by Romney\u2014also call into question the account of Romney\u2019s exit from Bain that the company and the Romney campaign have provided. \n \n Stericycle was a lucrative investment for Romney and Bain. The company had entered the medical-waste business a decade earlier, when it took over a food irradiation plant in Arkansas and began zapping medical waste, rather than strawberries, with radiation. The company subsequently replaced irradiation with a technology that used low-frequency radio waves to sterilize medical waste\u2014gowns, masks, gloves, and other medical equipment\u2014before it was transported to an incinerator. By mid-1997, Stericycle was the second-largest medical-waste disposal business in the nation. Two years later, it was the largest. With 240,000 customers, its operations spanned the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico. Fortune ranked it No. 10 on its list of the 100 fastest growing companies in the nation. \n \n But the company had its woes, accumulating a troubling safety record along the way. In 1991, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited its Arkansas operation for 11 workplace safety violations. The facility had not provided employees with sufficient protective gear, and it had kept body parts, fetuses, and dead experimental animals in unmarked storage containers, placing workers at risk. In 1995, Stericycle was fined $3.3 million\u2014later decreased to $800,000\u2014by Rhode Island for knowingly exposing workers to life-threatening diseases at its medical-waste treatment facility in Woonsocket. Two years later, workers at another of its medical-waste processing plants in Morton, Washington, were exposed to tuberculosis. In 2002 and 2003\u2014after Bain and its partners had bought their major interest in the firm\u2014Stericycle reached settlements with the attorneys general in Arizona and Utah after it was accused of violating antitrust laws. It paid Arizona $320,000 in civil penalties and lawyers\u2019 fees, and paid Utah $580,000. \n \n Despite the firm\u2019s regulatory run-ins, the deal worked out well for Bain. In 2001, the Bain-Madison Dearborn partnership that had invested in the company sold 40 percent of its holdings in Stericycle for about $88 million\u2014marking a hefty profit on its original investment of $75 million. The Bain-related group sold the rest of its holdings by 2004. By that point it had earned $49.5 million. It was not until six years later that anti-abortion activists would target Stericycle for collecting medical waste at abortion clinics. This campaign has compared Stericycle to German firms that provided assistance to the Nazis during the Holocaust. A Stericycle official told Huffington Post that its abortion clinics business constitutes a \u201csmall\u201d portion of its total operations. (Stericycle declined a request for comment from Mother Jones.) \n \n In 1995, Stericycle was fined by Rhode Island for knowingly exposing workers to life-threatening diseases at its medical-waste treatment facility. \n \n In response to questions from Mother Jones, a spokeswoman for Bain maintained that Romney was not involved in the Stericycle deal in 1999, saying that he had \u201cresigned\u201d months before the stock purchase was negotiated. The spokeswoman noted that following his resignation Romney remained only \u201ca signatory on certain documents,\u201d until his separation agreement with Bain was finalized in 2002. And Bain issued this statement: \u201cMitt Romney retired from Bain Capital in February 1999. He has had no involvement in the management or investment activities of Bain Capital, or with any of its portfolio companies since that time.\u201d (The Romney presidential campaign did not respond to requests for comment.) \n \n But the document Romney signed related to the Stericycle deal did identify him as a participant in that particular deal and the person in charge of several Bain entities. (Did Bain and Romney file a document with the SEC that was not accurate?) Moreover, in 1999, Bain and Romney both described his departure from Bain not as a resignation and far from absolute. On February 12, 1999, the Boston Herald reported, \u201cRomney said he will stay on as a part-timer with Bain, providing input on investment and key personnel decisions.\u201d And a Bain press release issued on July 19, 1999, noted that Romney was \u201ccurrently on a part-time leave of absence\u201d\u2014and quoted Romney speaking for Bain Capital. In 2001 and 2002, Romney filed Massachusetts state disclosure forms noting he was the 100 percent owner of Bain Capital NY, Inc.\u2014a Bain outfit that was incorporated in Delaware on April 13, 1999\u2014two months after Romney\u2019s supposed retirement from the firm. A May 2001 filing with the SEC identified Romney as \u201ca member of the Management Committee\u201d of two Bain entities. And in 2007, the Washington Post reported that R. Bradford Malt, a Bain lawyer, said Romney took a \u201cleave of absence\u201d when he assumed the Olympics post and retained sole ownership of the firm for two more years. \n \n All of this undermines Bain\u2019s contention that Romney, though he maintained an ownership interest in the firm and its funds, had nothing to do with the firm\u2019s activities after February 1999. The Stericycle deal may raise red flags for anti-abortion activists. But it also raises questions about the true timing of Romney\u2019s departure from Bain and casts doubt on claims by the company and the Romney campaign that he had nothing to do with Bain business after February 1999. ||||| WASHINGTON -- One of the highest performing companies in which the private equity firm founded by Mitt Romney invested is now a top target of the most vehement anti-abortion groups in the nation. \n \n Stericycle, a massive medical waste disposal service company, received a $75 million investment from Bain Capital in 1999 and soon became an industry leader. Today, it has more than 485,000 customers worldwide. Its clients include hospitals, blood banks, and pharmaceutical manufacturers. But it has also helped dispose of medical waste from Planned Parenthood and abortion clinics -- waste that included aborted fetuses -- and that has attracted the ire of the pro-life community and establishment Republicans. \n \n Romney's relationship to the company, which was flagged by the Democratic opposition research group American Bridge and further examined through an independent review of documents, is tangential. By the time Bain Capital had made the investment in Stericycle, he had left the firm to run the 2002 Winter Olympic Games. He maintained ownership in Bain and kept holdings in its private equity funds, which included Stericycle stock, but he had no say in the managerial or strategic decisions at the firm, according to Bain officials. \n \n But at a time when Romney is attempting to sell South Carolina voters on his pro-life record -- running values-themed radio ads and defending himself from attacks that say he governed as pro-abortion lawmaker -- the link between Stericycle and Bain could still cause him problems. \n \n \"It is pretty significant. A lot of these companies, unfortunately, don't know what is going on,\" said Michael Marcavage, director of the Campaign to Stop Stericycle, an offshoot of the evangelistic organization Repent America. \"You need to put morality before money and a lot of these companies need to look at who they are investing with ... Just imagine if the company was involved in discrimination against blacks? Who would want to be involved in that?\" \n \n \"If they knew that was going on and still looked at it as a business venture we would certainly speak heavily against it,\" Marcavage added. \n \n Stericycle's work with abortion clinics constitutes a \"small\" portion of its overall operations, an official with the company told The Huffington Post (the official declined to confirm whether or not Planned Parenthood specifically is still a client). And anti-abortion activists' decision to target it seems misdirected; what would those clinics be left to do without the services provided by Stericycle and companies like it? \n \n There is no publicly available data showing that either Romney or other officials at Bain knew of Stericycle's work with Planned Parenthood and abortion clinics before the investment. Nor would it be unreasonable if they knew about it and found it irrelevant. Bain, after all, is not a religious outfit, unless the religion is money-making. \n \n The Romney campaign did not return a request for comment. \n \n Bain's $75 million investment in the company was announced in August and finalized in November of 1999. An official with the firm told The Huffington Post that such deals are usually planned three or four months before the announcement date, which means it was likely conceived of after February 1999, when Romney left for the Olympics. The first reported documentation of Stericycle servicing an abortion clinic came in 2003, one year before Bain sold its stake in the company. \n \n Repent America itself only became aware of the issue in 2010, when it was reported that Stericycle had picked up \u201cbiohazardous waste\u201d at an abortion clinic in Richmond, Virginia. The group subsequently put pressure on Penske and Ryder, the truck-leasing companies that Stericycle had hired, to stop working with the medical waste disposal company. \n \n More than suggesting Bain's indifference to the abortion debate, the story the firm's involvement with Stericycle illustrates how the private equity chapter of Romney's career has complicated his political ambitions. Every company Bain has invested in has a story of its own, whether it's the use of generous tax breaks and government subsidies to build a steel company in Indiana or the rapid growth of Staples. \n \n With Stericycle, that story is as much about leveraging money to make more as the politics of abortion. \n \n The company was only a decade old when Bain began contemplating an investment. What the private equity firm found alluring was that Stericycle had a straightforward, fairly fail-safe strategy for growth. The waste and recycling behemoth Allied Waste Industries had spent $10 billion to acquire Browning-Ferris Industries in 1999 and was looking to sell its medical waste department in order to pay off the debt from that acquisition. Stericycle decided it would buy that division, which was, at the time, the country's largest. The company just needed help with funding. In stepped Bain and another private equity firm, Madison Dearborn Partners. \n \n On paper, it was a win-win situation. By consuming its number one competitor, Stericycle became the largest company in the industry. It added 200,000 new customers, saw a reported 266 percent increase in revenue within a year and was named the tenth-fastest growing company in the country by Fortune magazine. According to SEC data, it would go on to make more than $900 million in profits during the Bain years, from 1999 to 2004, and employment would increase by 1,200 -- owed largely to the company taking on workers from Browning-Ferris Industries. \n \n The deal was good for Bain too. According to an investment prospectus from December 2003, the return rate that Bain received on its investment in Stericycle was approximately 66 percent, or 49.5 million dollars. \n \n Romney had become governor of Massachusetts by then. But according to financial disclosure reports flagged by American Bridge and a review of SEC data, both he and his wife maintained investments in Bain Capital funds, including ones that had the Stericycle stock. \n \n Also on HuffPost:",

(Associated Press) \n \n Jamaica's Usain Bolt greets fans as he celebrates winning gold in the men's 4 x 100-meter relay final, during the athletics competitions of the 2016 Summer Olympics at the Olympic stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Friday, Aug. 19, 2016. (AP Photo/David Goldman) (Associated Press) \n \n RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) \u2014 Michael Phelps won more medals than anyone else, again. And then he said farewell, also again. \n \n Usain Bolt kissed the finish line goodbye after enhancing his Olympic legacy. Simone Biles and Katie Ledecky delivered under the burden of enormous expectations. Two strangers went from rivals to forever-linked by a display of kindness, an entire island seemed to celebrate a tennis match, and a gold medalist scampered home to avoid legal issues after a robbery story unraveled. \n \n And then the home team won soccer gold. \n \n The Rio de Janeiro Olympics were not perfect. \n \n But there were moments \u2014 some great, some dreadful and some downright ugly \u2014 that will not, and should not, be forgotten. \n \n Here's a look: \n \n ___ \n \n MEDAL LEADERS \n \n The U.S. dominated the medal count, a rare romp in a non-boycotted games. There's still more medals to win Sunday, but the margin of overall victory could be the most in a fully attended games in 68 years. Phelps won six medals, five of them gold, to increase his career haul to 23 Olympic titles and 28 medals overall. Ledecky and Biles each won five medals; Biles will carry the U.S. flag into the closing ceremony. And U.S. shooter Kim Rhode has now won a medal in six consecutive Olympics \u2014 and she might not be done. \n \n ___ \n \n BEST FINISH \n \n Bolt kissing the finish line after his ninth and final Olympic gold \u2014 in nine final races \u2014 was a perfect ending. He ran the anchor leg of the 4x100-meter relay for Jamaica, won emphatically to become the third athlete ever with nine golds in track and field, and insists that this will be the end of his Olympic career. \n \n \"Nothing left to prove,\" Bolt said. \n \n He's right. \n \n \"I am the greatest,\" he added. \n \n Right again. \n \n ___ \n \n BEST ACT OF SPORTSMANSHIP \n \n An easy pick. \n \n In the women's 5,000-meter heat, Abbey D'Agostino of the U.S. and New Zealand's Nikki Hamblin \u2014 strangers before that day \u2014 were involved in a tumble. D'Agostino helped Hamblin up, encouraging her to finish the race. D'Agostino tore a knee ligament in the fall and obviously couldn't finish. Hamblin wound up finishing last of 17 in the 5,000 final, so neither left with a medal. \n \n Instead, they got so much more. \n \n \"That girl is the Olympic spirit right there,\" Hamblin said of D'Agostino. \"I've never met her before. Like I never met this girl before. And isn't that just so amazing?\" \n \n Yes, it is. \n \n ___ \n \n BIGGEST EMBARRASSMENT \n \n Another easy pick, even in a games where an Egyptian was sent home after failing to shake an Israeli judo opponent's hand. \n \n Ryan Lochte is a 12-time Olympic medalist, and the odds that he'll have a chance to ever swim for a 13th are as murky as some of the pools were in these Rio Games. Lochte's story that a robber put a gun to his head quickly unraveled, his three teammates who were companions that night all were left to answer legal questions after he scurried home, and more repercussions from the U.S. Olympic Committee are likely coming. \n \n \"It's traumatic to be out late with your friends in a foreign country \u2014 with a language barrier,\" read part of the apology that Lochte released on social media Friday. \n \n Maybe so, but it bears noting that language barrier or no language barrier, the incident occurred after Lochte left a night out at ... Club France. So it would seem like not all foreign atmospheres struck him as traumatic before now. \n \n ___ \n \n BREAKOUT STAR \n \n We asked. You voted. \n \n Narrowing the list of potential candidates to four \u2014 Simone Manuel (four swimming medals), Joseph Schooling (beat Phelps for a gold in the pool), Monica Puig (whose tennis gold was Puerto Rico's first Olympic title in any sport) and Ibtihaj Muhammad (the barrier-breaking fencing medalist) \u2014 AP asked its Twitter followers to have a say in deciding this one. \n \n The response was overwhelming, and one-sided: Puig is the breakout star of these games. \n \n Reduced to tears many times after draping the Puerto Rican flag across her body after the gold-medal match, Puig beat two of the world's best five players to win the title. \n \n \"To do this ... is everything,\" Puig said. \n \n The Olympic ideal, personified. \n \n ___ \n \n BEST COACH \n \n Due respect to Mike Krzyzewski, Geno Auriemma, Martha Karolyi and the Japanese wrestling coach who found himself getting body-slammed twice in celebration by women's gold medalist Risako Kawai, this one goes to Ans Botha \u2014 the 74-year-old great-grandmother who guided South Africa's Wayde Van Niekerk to Olympic gold and a world record in the men's 400 sprint. \n \n Her style is simple. When the smile goes away and the voice gets stern, it's time to get serious. Sort of like most great-grandmothers. \n \n \"She's an amazing woman,\" Van Niekerk said. \"Her work ... I think it speaks for itself.\" \n \n ___ \n \n BEST COUPLE \n \n Decathlon champion Ashton Eaton of the U.S. and his wife, heptathlon bronze medalist Brianne Thiesen-Eaton of Canada, would be a very easy selection here. \n \n But what Kate Richardson-Walsh and Helen Richardson-Walsh did was even more rare. \n \n They're married, and played for the same gold-medal winning British women's field hockey team. In a games that had more openly gay athletes than ever before, theirs was a moment that surely resonated with many around the world who don't know the first thing about field hockey. \n \n \"To win an Olympic medal is special. To win an Olympic medal with your wife standing next to you ... we will cherish this for the rest of our lives,\" Kate Richardson-Walsh said. \n \n ___ \n \n BEST BACK-AND-FORTH \n \n When the U.S. women's soccer team was ousted by Sweden (and former U.S. coach Pia Sundhage), American goalkeeper Hope Solo raised eyebrows with her assessment of the match. \n \n But her former coach had the perfect rebuttal. \n \n \"We lost to a bunch of cowards,\" Solo said. \n \n \"It's OK to be cowards if you win,\" Sundhage countered. \n \n ___ \n \n BIGGEST OFF-FIELD STAR \n \n A tough category, especially after Leslie Jones of \"Saturday Night Live\" parlayed hilarious Twitter commentary into an invite to Rio. Matthew McConaughey hung out with everyone from the U.S. women's rugby team to Phelps, and Gisele Bundchen's catwalk in the opening ceremony was one not to forget. \n \n But the pick here is Zac Efron, who flew to Rio just to surprise the U.S. women's gymnastics team \u2014 particularly Biles, who doesn't hide her enormous crush on the actor. \n \n He also saw Bolt and the U.S. men's basketball team, but let's face it, no one is going to ignore invites to hang with Biles and the U.S. gymnasts right now. \n \n ___ \n \n BEST SPIN \n \n No one might have been better at their job during the Olympics than Mario Andrada, the spokesman for the Rio Games organizing committee. \n \n When something went wrong it was his job to explain it \u2014 and do so with the world watching and listening. He and International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams held daily hourlong briefings with reporters, and Andrada offered up some quote gems. So we'll go ahead and award his head-scratching statements their own set of medals. \n \n The bronze: \"Numbers mislead,\" he said, as part of an answer about ticket sales and poor crowds. \n \n The silver: \"Let's give these kids a break,\" he said of Lochte and his U.S. swimming teammates, after their incident. \n \n The gold: \"Chemistry is not an exact science,\" he said, talking about why the water at a diving pool went from blue to green. \n \n ___ \n \n BEST BRAZILIAN MOMENT ... \n \n Stand up and cheer, City of God. \n \n One of your own is now an Olympic champion. \n \n Slums, or favelas, are everywhere in Rio \u2014 none more infamous than the City of God, which rose to fame through the 2002 movie of the same name that depicted life in the slum. Rafaela Silva grew up there, and she won gold in judo at these Rio Games. \n \n Now that's a made-for-Hollywood story. \n \n ___ \n \n ... THAT IS, UNTIL THIS HAPPENED \n \n How's this for a storybook ending for Brazil? \n \n Soccer gold \u2014 and in most dramatic style, too. \n \n Brazil vs. Germany, men's soccer, gold-medal matchup. Neymar gives the hosts a 1-0 lead, but the Germans tie it and ultimately it goes to penalty kicks to decide the Olympic champion. \n \n Germany makes its first four. \n \n So does Brazil. \n \n Then Germany is stopped on its fifth, and the stage is set for Neymar \u2014 who else? \u2014 to set off a national celebration. His shot sails into the back of the net, Brazil wins and the roar could be heard all over Rio as Neymar collapsed on the field in a quivering mass of joyous tears. \n \n Forget all the problems these games had. Forget how many Brazilians opposed them in the first place. \n \n They got their perfect finish to an imperfect Olympics. ||||| In a rather delightful turn of events, the American Olympic gymnast, Simone Biles, has recently become a sensation and almost-household name thanks to her jaw-dropping power, laser precision and pure dynamism. She\u2019s certainly the best gymnast I\u2019ve seen in my lifetime and is bound to be a history-maker and record-breaker. \n \n It\u2019s truly wonderful to see people coming together in awe of an athlete for whom no performance enhancing drug would add to her medal tally. Technique that money can\u2019t buy and humility to match, what could be better? Any chef de mission will tell you that her results are the envy of Olympians worldwide. \n \n Gymnastics is a regular Olympic Games favourite, the gravity-defying tumbles are enough to keep anyone entertained. Sadly, for the first time in a number of years, Australia failed to field an Olympic women\u2019s gymnastics team in Rio. Our sole competitor, Larissa Miller, did her country proud with solid performances on floor and uneven bars but was denied a spot in the finals. \n \n Simone Biles the bandleader of a US quintet that might never be bettered | Bryan Armen Graham Read more \n \n Lauren Mitchell, an Olympian and Australia\u2019s first-ever female gymnastics world champion, was devastated to miss out on an Olympic berth due to a torn anterior cruciate ligament. Mitchell achieved an historic result for Australia in 2010, something to be truly proud of, but it would be misinformed to say that it was meaningful in terms of an upward trajectory for the Australian gymnastics team. Comparatively, American women\u2019s gymnasts have won the past four Olympic all-around titles, with an American in silver at two of those Games. \n \n Australia has long been a nation that has punched above its weight in the Olympic medal tally. Swimming, rowing, hockey, sailing, cycling, and most recently, women\u2019s sevens rugby, we\u2019ve managed to enjoy a reasonably consistent level of achievement over the past decades. So, you might find yourself asking \u2013 why are we not achieving better results in gymnastics? \n \n Almost anyone that has turned on the telly in Australia during an Olympic Games will tell you that the coverage leaves a lot to be desired. You\u2019re bound to see an awful lot of swimming; swimming heats, swimming semi-finals, swimming medal ceremonies. Heats, repeats, bronze medals. Over and over. Unless there\u2019s a gold medal within very close proximity in any other sport, you can be assured that it will only be covered in dribs and drabs; the main focus always on the pool. \n \n A lack of meaningful television coverage for minor Olympic sports may seem like a petty complaint, but like all actions, it has a consequence. A successful sporting code relies on one thing: competition. And what drives competition is high participation numbers. If a sport has meagre participation in a country, it\u2019s almost guaranteed to deliver mediocre performances because the competition is not tough enough to drive the nation forward. \n \n In the USA, gymnastics competitions are televised, the top competitors have sponsorship deals, and people know who they are. These are all clearly benefits of a slew of great results, but they also have the side-effect of getting more kids into more gyms. 4.6 million Americans participated in gymnastics in 2014 \u2013 1.4% of the population. Having higher levels of participation provides more coaching opportunities for retired elite gymnasts, which then keeps the knowledge, expertise and heritage of a top gymnast inside the sport, instead of having retired gymnasts having to get jobs outside of gymnastics. It\u2019s a cyclical effect; we need to build the same culture of being a \u201cgymnast for life\u201d in Australia that exists in the USA, China and Russia. \n \n Once we make a commitment to our gymnasts, we\u2019ll find that top-notch international coaches will be attracted to our sunny climates, driving the sport forward even further. When Peggy Liddick, the American coach to the multi-Olympic gold medalist, Shannon Miller, moved to Australia to head up our gymnastics team in 1996, we saw phenomenal results and improvement in our team. Liddick was the coach who helped Australia snag its first-ever world championship medals and has transformed gymnastics in Australia, but increased visibility and competition will only make it better. \n \n Admittedly, gymnastics is hardly as inclusive as say, swimming or athletics, but if Australia\u2019s proud history of incredible sporting achievements is anything to go by, there\u2019s no real reason why we can\u2019t claim this sport amongst them. After yet another disappointing Olympics for Australia, it\u2019s time that the Australian media diversifies its sporting interests and ends the obsession with showing every single swimming event.

In the poll, 68 percent of voters said lawmakers should wait to get that analysis, and 21 percent said they should vote anyway. \n \n This bill does appear to be polling at least somewhat higher than the earlier GOP ObamaCare repeal bill, which got just 12 percent approval in a USA Today/Suffolk University poll in June. \n \n The latest survey came the same day as a study from the Brookings Institution that found that at least 21 million people would lose health-care coverage under the new plan by 2026. ||||| (CNN) Sen. John McCain announced Friday in a statement that he cannot \"in good conscience\" vote for the GOP's latest plan to overhaul Obamacare, likely ending Republicans' latest effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. \n \n \"I cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal,\" the Arizona Republican said in a statement. \"I believe we could do better working together, Republicans and Democrats, and have not yet really tried. Nor could I support it without knowing how much it will cost, how it will (affect) insurance premiums, and how many people will be helped or hurt by it. Without a full CBO score, which won't be available by the end of the month, we won't have reliable answers to any of those questions.\" \n \n McCain's \"no\" vote means it is likely Republicans won't be able to repeal and replace Obamacare before September 30, as Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said he would not back Graham-Cassidy and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine has said she is leaning \"no\" on the proposal. But there are still questions as to where Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski is at the moment. It's also unclear if senators on the fence would support a procedural motion on the bill even if they decide they are against Graham-Cassidy in the end. \n \n Republicans need at least 50 votes to pass the measure under the process of reconciliation. \n \n Murkowski, Paul and Collins also under scrutiny \n \n McCain was one of three most-watched members on the fence and considered a key vote on the bill. Without his support, Republicans would need to get Murkowski as well as Collins to sign on. It's unlikely considering the fact that Collins said Friday afternoon that she was leaning against the bill and had key concerns that the legislation did not do enough to protect individuals with pre-existing conditions. \n \n \"I'm leaning against the bill,\" Collins said Friday at a Portland, Maine, event, according to The Portland Press Herald. \n \n A Republican aide involved in the process said Friday afternoon that GOP leaders are at the \"evaluating options\" stage right now. \n \n The aide added, \"I'm not breaking news telling you this isn't good.\" \n \n Paul, the only other Republican other than McCain who has so far definitively come out against Graham-Cassidy, is \"unlikely\" to change his mind even if changes are made to the bill, his spokesman Sergio Gor told CNN. \n \n Graham and McCain's close friendship \n \n McCain's announcement comes despite that one of the bill's key sponsors -- Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina -- is a close confidant. The thinking was if anyone could convince McCain to vote \"yes,\" it would be Graham. \n \n \"I take no pleasure in announcing my opposition. Far from it,\" McCain said. \"The bill's authors are my dear friends, and I think the world of them. I know they are acting consistently with their beliefs and sense of what is best for the country. So am I.\" \n \n McCain has said for weeks that he would not support health care legislation that had not gone through \"regular order,\" meaning Senate hearings, an amendment process and a rigorous floor debate. \n \n Graham said he \"respectfully\" disagrees with McCain and will \"press on\" with his legislation. \n \n \"My friendship with John McCain is not based on how he votes but respect for how he's lived his life and the person he is,\" Graham said in a statement and on Twitter, adding later, \"I feel an obligation to fix this disaster and intend to push forward for state-centric health care versus Washington-knows-best health care.\" \n \n My friendship with @SenJohnMcCain is not based on how he votes but respect for how he's lived his life and the person he is. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 22, 2017 \n \n McCain voted \"no\" on the last health care proposal in July for the same reason. McCain's dramatic floor vote, which happened just weeks after he was diagnosed with brain cancer, came in the early morning and was captured as one of his most \"maverick\" moments in the Senate. \n \n What the White House is thinking \n \n A senior White House official told CNN that McCain's opposition \"undeniably hurts\" the effort to repeal and replace Obamacare but that President Donald Trump is not ready to give up on the effort yet. \n \n \"The President has been engaged all along, and I think you will continue to see him reach out,\" the official said. \"We have been having conversations with Graham and Cassidy for a couple months and ... even though there may be members who want to give up, the President does not.\" \n \n Top White House aides have been talking with Graham and Sen. Bill Cassidy for months now, and in between events at the United Nations this week, Trump called senators to talk about the upcoming health care vote, White House officials said. Trump was hoping to solidify Republicans around the deal struck by the two senators and urged many of the lawmakers to stay loyal to him. \n \n The White House official, though, added that even though chances of passing health care look bleak, the White House intends to juggle between Graham-Cassidy and tax reform next week. \n \n Vice President Mike Pence indirectly addressed the decision during a speech Friday afternoon in Anderson, Indiana. \n \n \"The vote could come as early as next week and this is not going to be easy. Even now, the opposition is forming up and some have gone so far to announce their opposition already. But President Trump and I are undeterred,\" Pence said. \n \n \"We cannot in good conscious abandon this cause,\" Pence said to applause in his home state. \n \n Democrats praise McCain \n \n Just moments after McCain announced his opposition, Democrats seized on the opportunity to bring back bipartisan talks that had stalled last week. \n \n Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington and Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee had held bipartisan hearings over the last month on how to stabilize Obamacare marketplaces and were making progress in their negotiations. But the House leadership made it clear last week that the chamber probably would not be able to pass such a bill. \n \n As soon as McCain announced his opposition, Murray announced she was still open to reigniting those talks. \n \n \"I agree with Senator McCain that the right way to get things done in the Senate \u2014 especially on an issue as important to families as their health care \u2014 is through regular order and working together to find common ground,\" Murray said. \"I'm still at the table ready to keep working, and I remain confident that we can reach a bipartisan agreement as soon as this latest partisan approach by Republican leaders is finally set aside.\" \n \n Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also praised McCain shortly after his announcement. \n \n \"John McCain shows the same courage in Congress that he showed when he was a naval aviator,\" the New York Democrat said in a statement. \"I have assured Senator McCain that as soon as repeal is off the table, we Democrats are intent on resuming the bipartisan process.\" \n \n For her part, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said her members would continue working \"to put the stake in the heart of this monstrous bill.\" \n \n \"This weekend, we will continue to highlight the devastating costs Republicans are trying to inflict on hard-working Americans,\" she said in a letter to colleagues. \n \n This story has been updated and will update with additional developments.",

    "document": "Stephen Harper is heading to a crucial summit of NATO leaders where the Western military alliance will give itself the power to respond to threats more quickly in the face of Russia\u2019s continued effort to destabilize and break up Ukraine. \n \n NATO leaders are set to approve a rapid-reaction military force, drawn from their respective defence capabilities, that could be deployed to a crisis in Eastern Europe within two days, alliance officials say. This \u201cspearhead\u201d unit would have a permanent command centre staffed by rotating alliance members as well as supply depots located in various regions so troops would not have to fly in all their equipment. \n \n \u201cThis spearhead \u2026 could include several thousand troops, ready to respond where needed with air, sea and special-forces support,\u201d NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told a news conference Monday in Brussels. \n \n NATO\u2019s existing response force takes five days for the first units to arrive. \n \n This summit, originally meant to mark the end of the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan, will instead signal a shift to the defence of Europe as the alliance\u2019s central concern once more. \n \n Mr. Harper departed Ottawa Tuesday morning for the U.K. He'll first visit London\u200e to promote bilateral trade and investment in light of the Canada-European Union free-trade deal and then proceed to a Cardiff-area resort in Wales for talks with NATO member country leaders. \n \n The rapid-response force would not help Kiev, which has been battling pro-Moscow rebels for months after Russia unilaterally seized Crimea this spring and now has Vladimir Putin pressuring it to discuss \u201cstatehood\u201d for southeast regions of Ukraine. \n \n Canadian officials, speaking on background, made it clear that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has no plans to deploy troops to Ukraine, which is currently taking steps to apply for membership in the Western military alliance. It\u2019s unclear if, or when, Kiev might be admitted into the club, which has an agreement to defend member countries against attack. \n \n NATO appears to have shelved a proposal to permanently station alliance troops in new bases along its eastern flank, a measure sought by members such as Poland as a means of providing a deterrent to further Russian aggression. Member countries such as Germany rejected the idea because such a move could provoke Moscow. \n \n The rapid-reaction force, which could serve as a deterrent in its own right, appears to be a compromise. NATO officials said the force could grow from a small number to as large as a brigade, which would mean between 3,000 and 5,000 troops. It means NATO would be ready to quickly respond to Russian aggression that goes beyond Ukraine, which the alliance has confirmed with satellite imagery is now fighting Russian troops, and not just pro-Moscow rebels, on its own soil. \n \n Canada will be asked to contribute soldiers and equipment to NATO's new high-alert force. \n \n But the Canadian government refused to say Monday whether it would contribute on a regular basis to this rapid-reaction force, with officials saying only they would \u201cconsider all measures accordingly and look forward to discussions at the summit.\u201d \n \n The alliance, said Fen Hampson, director of the Global Security and Politics program at the Centre for International Governance Innovation in Waterloo, Ont., \u201cis divided between its East European and Baltic members who are deeply worried that Putin won\u2019t stop with Ukraine if he gets what he wants, and its major powers, Germany, the U.K. and France, who continue to believe that Putin is amenable to negotiation and persuasion.\u201d \n \n Canada was also wary of the proposal to permanently station NATO troops in new bases because there was insufficient detail on which allies might pay the bills or contribute troops and what the rules of engagement would be. \u201cNone of that was clear,\u201d a Canadian official said. \n \n The Harper government, expected to go to the polls in 2015, is also balking at a push for NATO countries to boost military spending to at least 2 per cent of gross domestic product. The British government is calling for this commitment at the summit. Britain is among a small minority of NATO members that currently spend 2 per cent or more of GDP on defence, while Canada spends roughly 1 per cent. \n \n Canadian officials defend their position, saying the NATO pledge goes beyond what Canadian taxpayers would support. They say Canada shouldered a big burden with its decade-long Afghanistan deployment and its contribution to Operation Protector in Libya. \n \n The Harper government has chopped military spending to balance the books, and a recent study said on an inflation-adjusted basis that Canada\u2019s defence budget is now smaller than it was in 2007. \n \n Ottawa has a ship, six fighter jets and rotating shifts of Canadian Armed Forces members on training exercises in Europe to help reassure NATO member countries concerned about further Russian aggression in the region. It\u2019s also matched sanctions imposed on Russians and Ukrainians linked to Moscow\u2019s efforts to menace Ukraine. \n \n Mr. Hampson said the summit marks a watershed moment for the alliance. \u201cNATO is facing its greatest crisis since the Berlin and Cuban crises of the Cold War,\u201d he said. \u201cNATO can show that it is a real alliance that is prepared to stand up to Putin\u2019s incursions, or it can fade into oblivion by issuing more frothy communiqu\u00e9s that commit its members to little.\u201d \n \n Editor's note: An earlier version of this article stated incorrectly that the next federal election is in 2016. This version has been corrected to say the vote is in 2015. ||||| KIEV/MOSCOW Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko accused Russia on Monday of \"direct and undisguised aggression\" which he said had radically changed the battlefield balance as Kiev's forces suffered a further reverse in their war with pro-Moscow separatists. \n \n In the latest in a string of setbacks in the past week, Ukraine's military said it had pulled back from defending a vital airport in the east of the country, near the city of Luhansk, where troops had been battling a Russian tank battalion. \n \n Poroshenko said in a speech there would be high-level personnel changes in the Ukrainian armed forces, whose troops fled a new rebel advance in the south which Kiev and its Western allies say has been backed up by Russian armored columns. \n \n Russian President Vladimir Putin, who called on Sunday for immediate negotiations on the \"statehood\" of southern and eastern Ukraine, blamed Kiev's leadership for refusing to enter into direct political talks with the separatists. \n \n European Union leaders decided at a summit on Saturday that the direct engagement of Russian troops in the war - still denied by the Kremlin - called for a stepping up of economic sanctions unless Moscow pulled its soldiers back. \n \n With German Chancellor Angela Merkel stressing that accepting Russia's behavior was not an option, EU ambassadors were to start discussing a new package of measures that could include a ban on Europeans buying Russian government bonds, EU sources said. \n \n Until last week Ukraine had appeared close to crushing the four-month rebellion in the east, which erupted after a pro-Moscow president was forced out of power by popular protests. But then the rebels opened a new front to the south on the coast of the Sea of Azov, pushing towards the city of Mariupol. \n \n AGGRESSION \n \n Poroshenko repeated Kiev's belief that Russian forces are helping the rebels to turn the tide of the war. \"Direct and undisguised aggression has been launched against Ukraine from a neighboring state. This has changed the situation in the zone of conflict in a radical way,\" he said in his speech at a military academy in Kiev. \n \n Defense Minister Valery Heletey added on his Facebook page that Ukraine no longer faced a threat from separatists but outright war with Russian troops. \"Unfortunately, in such a war, the losses will be numbered not in their hundreds, but in thousands, even tens of thousands,\" he said. \"We must refrain from panic and show that Ukrainians are not about to surrender.\" \n \n In the Belarussian capital, Minsk, separatists sat down for preliminary peace talks with Ukraine, saying they would be prepared to stay part of Ukraine if they were granted \"special status\", according to Russian news agencies. \n \n But they said one of their key conditions would be for Kiev to immediately end its military offensive. \n \n The separatists' demands did not appear, at first sight, to be acceptable to Kiev since they would leave the rebels in control of the territories of Ukraine's industrialized east and exercising a trade policy tilted towards Russia and away from integration with the European Union, which is Kiev's key aim. \n \n Military spokesman Andriy Lysenko said Ukrainian forces had pulled back from the airport near Luhansk. However, they had destroyed seven Russian tanks and identified a major build-up of Russian forces to the north and south of the city. \n \n \"According to our operational data, there are no fewer than four (Russian) battalion-tactical groups in Ukraine,\" he told reporters, adding that each one comprised 400 men. \n \n Speaking during a visit to Siberia, Putin repeated his call for talks. \"The current Kiev leadership does not want to carry out a substantive political dialogue with the east of its country,\" state news agency Itar-Tass cited him as telling journalists. \n \n Putin also said the separatists were trying to force Ukrainian troops from their current positions where they were firing on civilian targets. \"The aim of the militia fighters is to push away these armed forces and their artillery to not give them the possibility to shoot on residential areas,\" he said. \n \n NON-ALIGNED STATUS IN DOUBT \n \n Kiev has clung to a non-aligned status as it tried to steer between two dominant powers - Russia to the east and Europe to the west. However, NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Ukraine's political leaders expect a new parliament to abandon this status after an election next month in a possible prelude to an application to join the Western alliance. \n \n Putin made his statehood remarks two days after comparing the Kiev government with Nazis and warning the West not to \"mess with us\". On Sunday, Putin's spokesman said his call for talks on the statehood of southern and eastern Ukraine did not mean Moscow now endorsed rebel calls for independence for territory they have seized. \n \n However, Merkel took a hard line, although she acknowledged the sanctions have hurt German exporters to the Russian market. \n \n \"I have to say there is also an impact when you are allowed to move borders in Europe and attack other countries with your troops,\" she told a news conference. \"Accepting Russia's behavior is not an option. And therefore it was necessary to prepare further sanctions.\" \n \n EU leaders asked the executive European Commission to prepare further sanctions within a week, building on steps taken at the end of July, which targeted the energy, banking and defense sectors. \"I'm hearing that a ban on buying Russian government bonds could be in the next package,\" an EU official familiar with the preparations said. \n \n The July round forbade Europeans from buying or selling new bonds, shares or other financial instruments with a maturity of more than 90 days issued by major state-owned Russian banks. \n \n COMMON SENSE \n \n Putin called for the EU to think twice about stepping up the sanctions, which were first imposed after Russia's annexation of Ukraine in March. \"I hope that common sense will prevail and we will work in a normal modern way,\" the Interfax news agency reported him as saying. \n \n He won support from China, with which Putin wants to trade more as the West tightens its restrictions. \n \n \"A political solution is the only way out. Sanctions do not help to solve the underlying problems in Ukraine,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said. \n \n Several EU countries heavily dependent on Russian gas supplies, including the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria, opposed new measures, which require unanimous agreement. \n \n \"I consider sanctions meaningless and counterproductive,\" Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said on Sunday. \"I reserve a right to veto sanctions harming national interests of Slovakia.\" \n \n The EU could ban gas exports and limit industrial use as part of emergency measures to protect household energy supplies this winter as it prepares for a possible halt in Russian supplies due to the crisis, a source told Reuters. \n \n The United States and EU already extended sanctions after a Malaysian airliner was shot down over rebel territory in July, killing 298 people. Moscow has responded by banning the import of most Western foodstuffs and shutting down McDonald's restaurants but so far energy shipments to the EU have been unaffected. \n \n Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said there would be no military intervention from Russia in Ukraine. Moscow denies the presence of Russian tanks and troops there, despite what NATO and Western governments have said is overwhelming evidence to the contrary. \n \n (Additional reporting by Richard Balmforth in Kiev, Mark Trevelyan and Thomas Grove in Moscow, Noah Barkin in Berlin, Jan Strupczewski, Adrian Croft and Martin Santa in Brussels and Sui-Lee Wee in Beijing; Writing by David Stamp; Editing by Giles Elgood) ||||| Image copyright Reuters Image caption Tensions between Russia and Nato countries are high over the ongoing conflict in Ukraine \n \n Russia is to alter its military strategy as a result of the Ukraine crisis and Nato's presence in eastern Europe, a top Russian official says. \n \n Mikhail Popov, a Kremlin adviser, said that deteriorating relations with the US and Nato would be reflected in the updated strategy. \n \n Nato said on Monday it would boost its presence in eastern Europe to protect its members. \n \n Ukrainian troops are battling pro-Russian rebels in east Ukraine. \n \n About 2,600 people have died since fighting began in April. \n \n Ukraine's defence minister on Monday accused Russia of launching a \"great war\" that could claim tens of thousands of lives - claims dismissed by Russia, which denies actively supporting the rebels. \n \n 'Aggravating tensions' \n \n Mr Popov, deputy secretary of Russia's National Security Council, told Russia's RIA news agency that \"the military infrastructure of Nato member states\" was \"getting closer to [Russian] borders, including via enlargement\". \n \n Nato's actions were one of the key \"external threats\" to Russia, he said. \n \n \"Nato's planned action... is evidence of the desire of US and Nato leaders to continue their policy of aggravating tensions with Russia\", Mr Popov said. \n \n There were no details on how the doctrine might change. \n \n Analysis - Jonathan Marcus, diplomatic correspondent \n \n Image copyright Reuters Image caption Russia has indicated it will respond to Nato's increasing presence in eastern Europe \n \n Almost on the eve of Nato's summit gathering in Wales, the Russian government has signalled that it will respond to Nato's plans to make preparations to deploy crisis response forces to Eastern Europe, closer to Russia's borders. \n \n Nato insists that while there will be pre-positioned supplies and more exercises in Poland for example, these will not be permanent new bases.

Trump, his associates and Russia. \n \n A spokesperson for a law firm said on Tuesday that it had hired Washington-based researchers last year to gather damaging information about Mr. Trump on numerous subjects \u2014 including possible ties to Russia \u2014 on behalf of the Clinton campaign and the D.N.C. \n \n The revelation, which emerged from a letter filed in court on Tuesday, is likely to fuel new partisan attacks over federal and congressional investigations into Russia\u2019s attempts to disrupt last year\u2019s election and whether any of Mr. Trump\u2019s associates assisted in the effort. \n \n The president and his allies have argued for months that the investigations are politically motivated. They have challenged the information contained in the dossier, which was compiled by a former British spy who had been contracted by the Washington research firm Fusion GPS. ||||| The Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee helped fund research that resulted in a now-famous dossier containing allegations about President Trump's connections to Russia and possible coordination between his campaign and the Kremlin, people familiar with the matter said. \n \n Marc E. Elias, a lawyer representing the Clinton campaign and the DNC, retained Fusion GPS, a Washington firm, to conduct the research. \n \n After that, Fusion GPS hired dossier author Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer with ties to the FBI and the U.S. intelligence community, according to those people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \n \n Elias and his law firm, Perkins Coie, retained the company in April 2016 on behalf of the Clinton campaign and the DNC. Before that agreement, Fusion GPS's research into Trump was funded by an unknown Republican client during the GOP primary. \n \n The Clinton campaign and the DNC, through the law firm, continued to fund Fusion GPS's research through the end of October 2016, days before Election Day. \n \n Fusion GPS gave Steele's reports and other research documents to Elias, the people familiar with the matter said. It is unclear how or how much of that information was shared with the campaign and the DNC and who in those organizations was aware of the roles of Fusion GPS and Steele. One person close to the matter said the campaign and the DNC were not informed by the law firm of Fusion GPS's role. \n \n \n \n Former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele compiled the dossier on President Trump\u2019s alleged ties to Russia. (Victoria Jones/AP) \n \n The dossier has become a lightning rod amid the intensifying investigations into the Trump campaign's possible connections to Russia. Some congressional Republican leaders have spent months trying to discredit Fusion GPS and Steele and tried to determine the identity of the Democrat or organization that paid for the dossier. \n \n Trump tweeted as recently as Saturday that the Justice Department and FBI should \"immediately release who paid for it.\" \n \n Elias and Fusion GPS declined to comment on the arrangement. \n \n A DNC spokeswoman said \"[Chairman] Tom Perez and the new leadership of the DNC were not involved in any decision-making regarding Fusion GPS, nor were they aware that Perkins Coie was working with the organization. But let's be clear, there is a serious federal investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, and the American public deserves to know what happened.\" \n \n Brian Fallon, a former spokesman for the Clinton campaign, said he wasn't aware of the hiring during the campaign. \n \n \n \n Marc E. Elias of Perkins Coie represented the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post) \n \n \"The first I learned of Christopher Steele or saw any dossier was after the election,\" Fallon said. \"But if I had gotten handed it last fall, I would have had no problem passing it along and urging reporters to look into it. Opposition research happens on every campaign, and here you had probably the most shadowy guy ever running for president, and the FBI certainly has seen fit to look into it. I probably would have volunteered to go to Europe myself to try and verify if it would have helped get more of this out there before the election.\" \n \n Some of the details are included in a Tuesday letter sent by Perkins Coie to a lawyer representing Fusion GPS, telling the research firm that it was released from a \u00adclient-confidentiality obligation. The letter was prompted by a legal fight over a subpoena for Fusion GPS's bank records. \n \n People involved in the matter said that they would not disclose the dollar amounts paid to Fusion GPS but that the campaign and the DNC shared the cost. \n \n Steele previously worked in Russia for British intelligence. The dossier is a compilation of reports he prepared for Fusion GPS. The dossier alleged that the Russian government collected compromising information about Trump and that the Kremlin was engaged in an effort to assist his campaign for president. \n \n U.S. intelligence agencies later released a public assessment asserting that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to aid Trump. The FBI has been investigating whether Trump associates helped the Russians in that effort. \n \n [FBI once planned to pay former British spy who authored controversial Trump dossier] \n \n Trump has adamantly denied the allegations in the dossier and has dismissed the FBI probe as a witch hunt. \n \n Officials have said that the FBI has confirmed some of the information in the dossier. Other details, including the most sensational accusations, have not been verified and may never be. \n \n Fusion GPS's work researching Trump began during the Republican presidential primaries, when the GOP donor paid for the firm to investigate the real estate magnate's background. \n \n Fusion GPS did not start off looking at Trump's Russia ties but quickly realized that those relationships were extensive, according to the people familiar with the matter. \n \n When the Republican donor stopped paying for the research, Elias, acting on behalf of the Clinton campaign and the DNC, agreed to pay for the work to continue. The Democrats paid for research, including by Fusion GPS, because of concerns that little was known about Trump and his business interests, according to the people familiar with the matter. \n \n Those people said that it is standard practice for political campaigns to use law firms to hire outside researchers to ensure their work is protected by attorney-client and work-product privileges. \n \n The Clinton campaign paid Perkins Coie $5.6 million in legal fees from June 2015 to December 2016, according to campaign finance records, and the DNC paid the firm $3.6 million in \"legal and compliance consulting'' since November 2015 \u2014 though it's impossible to tell from the filings how much of that work was for other legal matters and how much of it related to Fusion GPS. \n \n At no point, the people said, did the Clinton campaign or the DNC direct Steele's activities. They described him as a Fusion GPS subcontractor. \n \n Some of Steele's allegations began circulating in Washington in the summer of 2016 as the FBI launched its counterintelligence investigation into possible connections between Trump associates and the Kremlin. Around that time, Steele shared some of his findings with the FBI. \n \n After the election, the FBI agreed to pay Steele to continue gathering intelligence about Trump and Russia, but the bureau pulled out of the arrangement after Steele was publicly identified in news reports. \n \n The dossier was published by BuzzFeed News in January. Fusion GPS has said in court filings that it did not give BuzzFeed the documents. \n \n Current and former U.S. intelligence officials said that Steele was respected by the FBI and the State Department for earlier work he performed on a global corruption probe. \n \n In early January, then-FBI Director James B. Comey presented a two-page summary of Steele's dossier to President Barack Obama and President-elect Trump. In May, Trump fired Comey, which led to the appointment of Robert S. Mueller III as special counsel investigating the Trump-Russia matter. \n \n Congressional Republicans have tried to force Fusion GPS to identify the Democrat or group behind Steele's work, but the firm has said that it will not do so, citing confidentiality agreements with its clients. \n \n Last week, Fusion GPS executives invoked their constitutional right not to answer questions from the House Intelligence Committee. The firm's founder, Glenn Simpson, had previously given a 10-hour interview to the Senate Judiciary Committee. \n \n Over objections from Democrats, the Republican leader of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.), subpoenaed Fusion GPS's bank records to try to identify the mystery client. \n \n Fusion GPS has been fighting the release of its bank records. A judge on Tuesday extended a deadline for Fusion GPS's bank to respond to the subpoena until Friday while the company attempts to negotiate a resolution with Nunes. \n \n Julie Tate contributed to this report. \n \n Read more: \n \n What the Trump dossier says \u2014 and what it doesn\u2019t \n \n Hillary Clinton\u2019s disingenuous dossier outrage \n \n Trump suggests FBI may have \u2018paid for\u2019 dossier alleging Russia ties ||||| FILE - In this March 21, 2016, file photo, attorney Marc Elias, one of several lawyers who appeared in the in the case of Wittman v.

Personhuballah, stands on the plaza of the Supreme Court in Washington.... (Associated Press) \n \n WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee helped fund political research into President Donald Trump that ultimately produced a dossier of allegations about his ties to Russia, a person familiar with the matter said Tuesday night. \n \n The revelation is likely to fuel complaints by Trump that the dossier, which the president has derided as \"phony stuff,\" is a politically motivated collection of salacious claims. Yet the FBI has worked to corroborate the document, and in a sign of its ongoing relevance to investigators, special counsel Robert Mueller's team \u2014 which is probing potential coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign \u2014 weeks ago questioned the former British spy, Christopher Steele, who helped compile the claims in the dossier. \n \n The dossier, which circulated in Washington last year and was turned over to the FBI for its review, contends that Russia was engaged in a longstanding effort to aid Trump and had amassed compromising information about him. Trump has repeatedly dismissed the document as false and in recent days has questioned on Twitter whether Democrats or the FBI had helped fund it. \n \n Trump has also attacked the findings of the FBI, NSA and CIA that Russia waged a large-scale influence campaign to interfere in the election. The FBI and the CIA have said with high confidence that the effort was aimed at hurting Clinton's candidacy and helping Trump. The NSA found the same with \"moderate\" confidence. \n \n The person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential client matters, said the arrangement was brokered by Marc Elias, a lawyer for the campaign and the DNC, and his law firm of Perkins Coie. \n \n The deal began in the spring of 2016, when the firm was approached by Fusion GPS, the political research firm behind the dossier, and lasted until right before Election Day, according to the person. When Fusion approached Elias, it had already been doing research work on Trump for a client during the GOP primary. The identity of the original client has not been revealed. \n \n It's unclear what Fusion GPS had dug up by the time law firm hired them in April 2016. According to a copy of the dossier published by BuzzFeed this year, the earliest report from Steele dates to June 2016, two months later. It was not immediately known how much money Fusion received or how many others in the Clinton campaign or DNC were aware that the firm had been retained. \n \n Elias did not immediately return an email seeking comment, and representatives of Fusion GPS declined to comment. The Washington Post first reported the arrangement. \n \n Clinton campaign officials did not immediately comment, but in a statement, a DNC spokeswoman said chairman Tom Perez was not part of the decision-making and was unaware that Perkins Coie was working with Fusion GPS. \n \n \"But let's be clear, there is a serious federal investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, and the American public deserves to know what happened,\" the statement said. \n \n Former Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said on Twitter that he regretted not knowing about Steele's hiring before the election, and that had he known, \"I would have volunteered to go to Europe and try to help him.\" \n \n \"I have no idea what Fusion or Steele were paid,\" he wrote in another tweet, \"but if even a shred of that dossier ends up helping Mueller, it will prove money well spent.\" \n \n According to a letter obtained by the AP Tuesday night, representatives of Fusion GPS reached out to the firm in early March 2016 to express interest in continuing research on Trump it had begun \"for one or more other clients during the Republican primary contest.\" \n \n At that time, the Clinton campaign was looking toward the general election and was pivoting attention to Trump, the emerging Republican front-runner. The person said Trump, by virtue of his extensive international business dealings, was seen as a natural target for complicated opposition research abroad. \n \n Perkins Coie then engaged Fusion GPS in April 2016 \"to perform a variety of research services during the 2016 election cycle,\" according to the letter. \n \n The dossier created a political firestorm in January when it was revealed that then-FBI Director James Comey had alerted Trump to the existence of allegations about him and Russia. Since then, Trump has repeatedly attacked the document and Republicans in Congress have worked to discredit it, even issuing a subpoena that seeks to force the disclosure of Fusion GPS's bank records. \n \n The letter, sent Tuesday by the general counsel of Perkins Coie to a lawyer for Fusion GPS, was intended to release the research firm from its obligation to keep confidential the identity of the law firm client. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Chad Day and Ken Thomas contributed to this report. \n \n ___ \n \n Read the letter: http://apne.ws/UK0Ojir",

    "document": "As the species with a sequenced genome closest to our most recent aquatic ancestor, the coelacanth provides a unique opportunity to identify genomic changes that were associated with the successful adaptation of vertebrates to the land environment. \n \n Over the 400 Myr that vertebrates have lived on land, some genes that are unnecessary for existence in their new environment have been eliminated. To understand this aspect of the water-to-land transition, we surveyed the Latimeria genome annotations to identify genes that were present in the last common ancestor of all bony fish (including the coelacanth) but that are missing from tetrapod genomes. More than 50 such genes, including components of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling, TGF-\u03b2 and bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signalling, and WNT signalling pathways, as well as many transcription factor genes, were inferred to be lost based on the coelacanth data (Supplementary Data 7 and Supplementary Fig. 9). Previous studies of genes that were lost in this transition could only compare teleost fish to tetrapods, meaning that differences in gene content could have been due to loss in the tetrapod or in the lobe-finned fish lineages. We were able to confirm that four genes that were shown previously to be absent in tetrapods (And1 and And2 (ref. 29), Fgf24 (ref. 30) and Asip2 (ref. 31)), were indeed present and intact in Latimeria, supporting the idea that they were lost in the tetrapod lineage. \n \n We functionally annotated more than 50 genes lost in tetrapods using zebrafish data (gene expression, knock-downs and knockouts). Many genes were classified in important developmental categories (Supplementary Data 7): fin development (13 genes); otolith and ear development (8 genes); kidney development (7 genes); trunk, somite and tail development (11 genes); eye (13 genes); and brain development (23 genes). This implies that critical characters in the morphological transition from water to land (for example, fin-to-limb transition and remodelling of the ear) are reflected in the loss of specific genes along the phylogenetic branch leading to tetrapods. However, homeobox genes, which are responsible for the development of an organism\u2019s basic body plan, show only slight differences between Latimeria, ray-finned fish and tetrapods; it would seem that the protein-coding portion of this gene family, along with several others (Supplementary Note 9, Supplementary Tables 12\u201316 and Supplementary Fig. 10), have remained largely conserved during the vertebrate land transition (Supplementary Fig. 11). \n \n As vertebrates transitioned to a new land environment, changes occurred not only in gene content but also in the regulation of existing genes. Conserved non-coding elements (CNEs) are strong candidates for gene regulatory elements. They can act as promoters, enhancers, repressors and insulators32, 33, and have been implicated as major facilitators of evolutionary change34. To identify CNEs that originated in the most recent common ancestor of tetrapods, we predicted CNEs that evolved in various bony vertebrate (that is, ray-finned fish, coelacanth and tetrapod) lineages and assigned them to their likely branch points of origin. To detect CNEs, conserved sequences in the human genome were identified using MULTIZ alignments of bony vertebrate genomes, and then known protein-coding sequences, untranslated regions (UTRs) and known RNA genes were excluded. Our analysis identified 44,200 ancestral tetrapod CNEs that originated after the divergence of the coelacanth lineage. They represent 6% of the 739,597 CNEs that are under constraint in the bony vertebrate lineage. We compared the ancestral tetrapod CNEs to mouse embryo ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing) data obtained using antibodies against p300, a transcriptional coactivator. This resulted in a sevenfold enrichment in the p300 binding sites for our candidate CNEs and confirmed that these CNEs are indeed enriched for gene regulatory elements. \n \n Each tetrapod CNE was assigned to the gene whose transcription start site was closest, and gene-ontology category enrichment was calculated for those genes. The most enriched categories were involved with smell perception (for example, sensory perception of smell, detection of chemical stimulus and olfactory receptor activity). This is consistent with the notable expansion of olfactory receptor family genes in tetrapods compared with teleosts, and may reflect the necessity of a more tightly regulated, larger and more diverse repertoire of olfactory receptors for detecting airborne odorants as part of the terrestrial lifestyle. Other significant categories include morphogenesis (radial pattern formation, hind limb morphogenesis, kidney morphogenesis) and cell differentiation (endothelial cell fate commitment, epithelial cell fate commitment), which is consistent with the body-plan changes required for land transition, as well as immunoglobulin VDJ recombination, which reflects the presumed response differences required to address the novel pathogens that vertebrates would encounter on land (Supplementary Note 10 and Supplementary Tables 17\u201324). \n \n A major innovation of tetrapods is the evolution of limbs characterized by digits. The limb skeleton consists of a stylopod (humerus or femur), the zeugopod (radius and ulna, or tibia and fibula), and an autopod (wrist or ankle, and digits). There are two major hypotheses about the origins of the autopod; that it was a novel feature of tetrapods, and that it has antecedents in the fins of fish35 (Supplementary Note 11 and Supplementary Fig. 12). We examine here the Hox regulation of limb development in ray-finned fish, coelacanth and tetrapods to address these hypotheses. \n \n In mouse, late-phase digit enhancers are located in a gene desert that is proximal to the HOX-D cluster36. Here we provide an alignment of the HOX-D centromeric gene desert of coelacanth with those of tetrapods and ray-finned fishes (Fig. 2a). Among the six cis-regulatory sequences previously identified in this gene desert36, three sequences show sequence conservation restricted to tetrapods (Supplementary Fig. 13). However, one regulatory sequence (island 1) is shared by tetrapods and coelacanth, but not by ray-finned fish (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 14). When tested in a transient transgenic assay in mouse, the coelacanth sequence of island 1 was able to drive reporter expression in a limb-specific pattern (Fig. 2c). This suggests that island 1 was a lobe-fin developmental enhancer in the fish ancestor of tetrapods that was then coopted into the autopod enhancer of modern tetrapods. In this case, the autopod developmental regulation was derived from an ancestral lobe-finned fish regulatory element. \n \n Figure 2: Alignment of the HOX-D locus and an upstream gene desert identifies conserved limb enhancers. a, Organization of the mouse HOX-D locus and centromeric gene desert, flanked by the Atf2 and Mtx2 genes.

Excretion of nitrogen is a major physiological challenge for terrestrial vertebrates. In aquatic environments, the primary nitrogenous waste product is ammonia, which is readily diluted by surrounding water before it reaches toxic levels, but on land, less toxic substances such as urea or uric acid must be produced instead (Supplementary Fig. 15). The widespread and almost exclusive occurrence of urea excretion in amphibians, some turtles and mammals has led to the hypothesis that the use of urea as the main nitrogenous waste product was a key innovation in the vertebrate transition from water to land37. \n \n With the availability of gene sequences from coelacanth and lungfish, it became possible to test this hypothesis. We used a branch-site model in the HYPHY package38, which estimates the ratio of synonymous (dS) to non-synonymous (dN) substitutions (\u03c9 values) among different branches and among different sites (codons) across a multiple-species sequence alignment. For the rate-limiting enzyme of the hepatic urea cycle, carbamoyl phosphate synthase I (CPS1), only one branch of the tree shows a strong signature of selection (P = 0.02), namely the branch leading to tetrapods and the branch leading to amniotes (Fig. 3); no other enzymes in this cycle showed a signature of selection. Conversely, mitochondrial arginase (ARG2), which produces extrahepatic urea as a byproduct of arginine metabolism but is not involved in the production of urea for nitrogenous waste disposal, did not show any evidence of selection in vertebrates (Supplementary Fig. 16). This leads us to conclude that adaptive evolution occurred in the hepatic urea cycle during the vertebrate land transition. In addition, it is interesting to note that of the five amino acids of CPS1 that changed between coelacanth and tetrapods, three are in important domains (the two ATP-binding sites and the subunit interaction domain) and a fourth is known to cause a malfunctioning enzyme in human patients if mutated39. \n \n Figure 3: Phylogeny of Cps1 coding sequences is used to determine positive selection within the urea cycle. Branch lengths are scaled to the expected number of substitutions per nucleotide, and branch colours indicate the strength of selection (dN/dS or \u03c9). Red, positive or diversifying selection (\u03c9 > 5); blue, purifying selection (\u03c9 = 0); yellow, neutral evolution (\u03c9 = 1). Thick branches indicate statistical support for evolution under episodic diversifying selection. The proportion of each colour represents the fraction of the sequence undergoing the corresponding class of selection.

In particular, the placenta is a complex structure that is critical for providing gas and nutrient exchange between mother and fetus, and is also a major site of haematopoiesis41. \n \n We have identified a region of the coelacanth HOX-A cluster that may have been involved in the evolution of extra-embryonic structures in tetrapods, including the eutherian placenta. Global alignment of the coelacanth Hoxa14\u2013Hoxa13 region with the homologous regions of the horn shark, chicken, human and mouse revealed a CNE just upstream of the coelacanth Hoxa14 gene (Supplementary Fig. 17a). This conserved stretch is not found in teleost fishes but is highly conserved among horn shark, chicken, human and mouse despite the fact that the chicken, human and mouse have no Hoxa14 orthologues, and that the horn shark Hoxa14 gene has become a pseudogene. This CNE, HA14E1, corresponds to the proximal promoter-enhancer region of the Hoxa14 gene in Latimeria. HA14E1 is more than 99% identical between mouse, human and all other sequenced mammals, and would therefore be considered to be an ultra-conserved element42. The high level of conservation suggests that this element, which already possessed promoter activity, may have been coopted for other functions despite the loss of the Hoxa14 gene in amniotes (Supplementary Fig. 17bc). Expression of human HA14E1 in a mouse transient transgenic assay did not give notable expression in the embryo proper at day 11.5 (information is available online at the VISTA enhancer browser website; http://enhancer.lbl.gov/cgi-bin/imagedb3.pl?form=presentation&show=1&experiment_id=501&organism_id=1), which was unexpected as its location would predict that it would regulate axial structures caudally43. A similar experiment in chick embryos using the chicken HA14E1 also showed no activity in the anteroposterior axis. However, strong expression was observed in the extraembryonic area vasculosa of the chick embryo (Fig. 4a). Examination of a Latimeria BAC Hoxa14-reporter transgene in mouse embryos showed that the Hoxa14 gene is specifically expressed in a subset of cells in an extra-embryonic region at embryonic day 8.5 (Fig. 4b). \n \n Figure 4: Transgenic analysis implicates involvement of Hox CNE HA14E1 in extraembryonic activities in the chick and mouse. a, Chicken HA14E1 drives reporter expression in blood islands in chick embryos. A construct containing chicken HA14E1 upstream of a minimal (thymidine kinase) promoter driving enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) was electroporated in HH4-stage chick embryos together with a nuclear mCherry construct. GFP expression was analysed at stage approximately HH11. The green aggregations and punctate staining are observed in the blood islands and developing vasculature. b, Expression of Latimeria Hoxa14-reporter transgene in the developing placental labyrinth of a mouse embryo.

Immunohistochemistry was used to detect RFP (brown staining in a small number of cells). Full size image (388 KB) \n \n Download PowerPoint slide (500 KB) Previous \n \n Figures index \n \n These findings suggest that the HA14E1 region may have been evolutionarily recruited to coordinate regulation of posterior HOX-A genes (Hoxa13, Hoxa11 and Hoxa10), which are known to be expressed in the mouse allantois and are critical for early formation of the mammalian placenta44. Although Latimeria does not possess a placenta, it gives birth to live young and has very large, vascularised eggs, but the relationship between Hoxa14, the HA14E1 enhancer and blood island formation in the coelacanth remains unknown. ||||| In the hope of reconstructing a pivotal step in evolution \u2014 the colonization of land by fish that learned to walk and breathe air \u2014 researchers have decoded the genome of the coelacanth, a prehistoric-looking fish whose form closely resembles those seen in the fossils of 400 million years ago. \n \n Often called a living fossil, the coelacanth (pronounced SEE-luh-canth) was long believed to have fallen extinct 70 million years ago, until a specimen was recognized in a fish market in South Africa in 1938. The coelacanth has fleshy, lobed fins that look somewhat like limbs, as does the lungfish, an air-breathing freshwater fish. The coelacanth and the lungfish have long been battling for the honor of which is closer to the ancestral fish that first used fins to walk on land and give rise to the tetrapods, meaning all the original vertebrates and their descendants, from reptiles and birds to mammals. \n \n The decoding of the coelacanth genome, reported online Wednesday in the journal Nature, is a victory for the lungfish as the closer relative to the first tetrapod. But the coelacanth may have the last laugh because its genome \u2014 which, at 2.8 billion units of DNA, is about the same size as a human genome \u2014 is decodable, whereas the lungfish genome, a remarkable 100 billion DNA units in length, cannot be cracked with present methods. The coelacanth genome is therefore more likely to shed light on the central evolutionary question of what genetic alterations were needed to change a lobe-finned fish into the first land-dwelling tetrapod. \n \n Photo \n \n The idea of decoding the coelacanth genome began six years ago when Chris Amemiya, a biologist at the University of Washington in Seattle, acquired some samples of coelacanth tissue. He asked the Broad Institute of Harvard and M.I.T., a biological research institute in Cambridge, Mass., to decode the DNA and invited experts in evolutionary and developmental biology to help interpret the results. \n \n Dr. Amemiya\u2019s team has sifted through the coelacanth\u2019s genome for genes that might have helped its cousin species, the ancestor to the first tetrapod, invade dry land some 400 million years ago. They have found one gene that is related to those that, in animal species, build the placenta. Coelacanths have no placenta, but they produce extremely large eggs, with a good blood supply, that hatch inside the mother\u2019s body. This gene could have been developed by land animals into a way of constructing the placenta. \n \n Another helpful preadaptation is a snippet of DNA that enhances the activity of the genes that drive the formation of limbs in the embryo. The Amemiya team focused on the enhancer DNA sequence because it occurred in the coelacanth and animals but not in ordinary fish. They then inserted the coelacanth enhancer DNA into mice. \n \n \u201cIt lit up right away and made an almost normal limb,\u201d said Neil Shubin, meaning that the coelacanth gene enhancer successfully encouraged the mouse genes to make a limb. Dr. Shubin, a member of the team, is a paleontologist at the University of Chicago. \n \n Present-day coelacanths are ferocious predators that live in a twilight zone about 500 feet deep where light barely penetrates. They lurk in caves during the day and emerge at night to attack surface fish as they descend and deep-sea fish as they rise to the surface. They have no evident need of fins that might help them walk on land. \n \n \u201cThis is probably an unusual habitat for this lineage,\u201d said Axel Meyer, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Konstanz in Germany and a member of the team. \u201cOther coelacanths lived in more shallow, estuarylike environments 400 million years ago, and you can envisage them using the fins more like walking legs.\u201d \n \n The Amemiya team reports evidence that the coelacanth\u2019s genes have been evolving more slowly than those of mammals, possibly because of \u201ca static habitat and lack of predators.\u201d But its environment must have changed quite considerably over the last 400 million years, Dr. Meyer said. Its principal habitat at present is the caves beneath the Comoro Islands in the Indian Ocean, but since these are extinct volcanoes a mere 5 million to 10 million years old, they must be a quite recent home for the coelacanth. \n \n The Amemiya team does not possess a full coelacanth \u2014 these are endangered species \u2014 and decoded the genome from tissues obtained from Rosemary Dorrington of Rhodes University in South Africa. Dr. Dorrington supplied DNA kits to the Comoro Islands fishermen who occasionally snag coelacanths by accident. When a coelacanth was captured in 2003, they preserved blood and tissues, which were given to Dr. Dorrington and kept frozen, Dr. Amemiya said. \n \n The specimen was preserved in Moroni, the capital of the Comoro Islands, but Dr. Amemiya has been unable to find out where it is now because of the constant state of civil war in the islands, he said. \n \n Can he be certain, then, that the tissue came from a coelacanth? \u201cOh, no question,\u201d Dr. Amemiya said. \u201cWe have DNA from several other coelacanths, from Africa and Indonesia, which is very similar to this one.\u201d The one caught in 2003 was identified as a coelacanth by Said Ahamada, a South African expert, Dr. Amemiya said. \n \n Because the original specimen is not available and the DNA sequencing is incomplete, the Amemiya team does not know its sex. \n \n Lobe-finned fish like the coelacanth and lungfish are known to zoologists as sarcopterygians, meaning fleshy fins. Tetrapods, including people, are descended from this group, and the coelacanth is more closely related to people than to other fish. \u201cEvolutionarily speaking, we are sarcopterygian fish,\u201d Dr. Meyer said.",

Now, scientists have decoded the endangered species' genome, and they say they've found some clues as to how today's land animals evolved from a fish ancestor, reports the New York Times. First, some fascinating backstory: The Times explains that the coelacanth and lung fish\u2014both \"lobe-finned fish\"\u2014have been duking it out for the title of the closet relative to that first ancestral fish that used its fins to walk on land. Post-decoding, the lungfish emerges as the closer relative, but in the Times' telling, the \"coelacanth may have the last laugh\"\u2014that's because the lungfish genome is too long to decode using current technology. What scientists learned from the coelacanths' DNA: Even though coelacanths don't have a placenta, they have a gene related to one that allows land animals to grow a placenta. A DNA sequence found in coelacanths, but not ordinary fish, bolsters the genes that helps an embryo grow limbs.

    "document": "It is an idea that flies in the face of the prevailing ethos on Wall Street and in many executive suites the last few decades. But there is sound economic theory behind the idea. \u201cEfficiency wages\u201d is the term that economists \u2014 who excel at giving complex names to obvious ideas \u2014 use for the notion that employers who pay workers more than the going rate will get more loyal, harder-working, more productive employees in return. \n \n Walmart\u2019s experiment holds some surprising lessons for the American economy as a whole. Productivity gains have been slow for years; could fatter paychecks reverse that? Demand for goods and services has remained stubbornly low ever since the 2008 economic crisis. If companies paid people more, would it bring out more shoppers \u2014 benefiting workers and shareholders alike? \n \n Deep in a warren of windowless offices here, executives in early 2015 sketched out a plan to spend more money on increased wages and training, and offer more predictable scheduling. They refer to this plan as \u201cthe investments.\u201d \n \n The results are promising. By early 2016, the proportion of stores hitting their targeted customer-service ratings had rebounded to 75 percent. Sales are rising again. \n \n That said, the immediate impact on earnings and the company\u2019s stock price have been less rosy. \n \n The question for Walmart is ultimately whether that short-run hit makes the company a stronger competitor in the long run. Will the investments turn out to be the beginning of a change in how Walmart and other giant companies think about their workers, or just a one-off experiment to be reversed when the next recession rolls around? \n \n The future health of the United States economy, and the well-being of its workers, may well depend on the answer. \n \n Pressure From Investors \n \n On the morning of Feb. 19, 2015, Walmart\u2019s 1.2 million employees across the United States gathered \u2014 many in front of their stores\u2019 vast walls of televisions for sale \u2014 to watch a video feed by their chief executive. Doug McMillon, wearing a sweater and sitting in the office once occupied by the company founder Sam Walton, more or less acknowledged that Walmart had made a mistake. It had gone too far in trying to cut payroll costs to the bone. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n \u201cSometimes we don\u2019t get it all right,\u201d Mr. McMillon said in the video. \u201cSometimes we make policy changes or other decisions and they don\u2019t result in what we thought they were going to. And when we don\u2019t get it right, we adjust.\u201d \n \n What most store employees probably didn\u2019t know was that Mr. McMillon and his executive team, who had been promoted into their jobs a year earlier, were under extraordinary pressure from investors. They needed to reverse a slide in business and fight off threats in all directions \u2014 dollar discounters on the low end, Amazon online, direct competitors like Target and countless rivals specializing in one slice of Walmart\u2019s business, from grocery chains to home-improvement warehouses. \n \n People were shopping more \u2014 at Walmart\u2019s rivals. \n \n The company offers its millions of shoppers a simple way to make their dissatisfaction known. On the back of sales receipts is a message, \u201cTell us about your visit today,\u201d along with instructions to log on to a website and answer questions about the store: Was it clean? Were they able to get what they came for quickly? Were employees friendly? \n \n In early 2015, the answers that poured into Walmart\u2019s global headquarters were, in a word, awful. The people paid to analyze the company tended to agree, too. A report by analysts at Wolfe Research in 2014 included photographs from a visit to Walmart of a sad-looking display of nearly empty bins of oranges and lemons and disorganized shelves of crackers. \n \n \u201cWalmart U.S.\u2019s relentless focus on costs does seem to have taken some toll on in-store conditions and stock levels,\u201d they wrote. The analysts wryly added: \u201cIf an item is not on the shelf, you cannot sell it.\u201d \n \n The company had been busy raising profits by cutting labor costs. The number of employees in the United States fell by 7 percent from early 2008 to early 2013, for example, a span in which the square footage of stores rose 13 percent. \n \n Some of that reflects technological advances, like self-checkout kiosks. But when Mr. McMillon and a new team came in to reverse the slide starting in early 2014, they diagnosed the problem as having taken the cost-cutting logic too far. \n \n From store managers nationwide, they heard that years of cost-cutting meant Walmart had become viewed as a last-ditch option for employment \u2014 not the place that ambitious people might want to work. They were under such pressure to keep labor costs low that the employees they hired showed little loyalty or career-building devotion to their jobs. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n \u201cWe realized quickly that wages are only one part of it, that what also matters are the schedules we give people, the hours that they work, the training we give them, the opportunities you provide them,\u201d said Judith McKenna, who became chief operating officer in late 2014, in a recent interview. \u201cWhat you\u2019ve got to do is not just fix one part, but get all of these things moving together.\u201d \n \n That is how Walmart decided to build 200 training centers to offer a clearer path for hourly employees who want to get on the higher-paying management track. And it said it would raise its hourly pay to a minimum of $10 for workers who complete a training course and raise department manager pay to $15 an hour, from $12. It said it would offer more flexible and predictable schedules to hourly workers. \n \n The news from Bentonville made headlines worldwide. The federal minimum wage had been $7.25 since 2009, and the labor market had awarded meager pay gains for people at the lower end of the spectrum for decade, facts that helped increase Walmart\u2019s bottom line. Now, the United States\u2019 largest private employer \u2014 Walmart has about 2.3 million workers around the world \u2014 was signaling it was about to gingerly try a different approach, putting $2.7 billion where its mouth was. \n \n Walmart says its average pay for a full-time nonmanagerial employee is now $13.69 an hour, up 16 percent since early 2014. In the same span, consumer prices have risen 2.1 percent. \n \n Back to the Classroom \n \n On a Thursday morning in late summer, at a Walmart Supercenter No. 359 in Fayetteville, Walmart trainees followed instructors around to learn what this particular store was doing right, and wrong, on this particular day. Teresa Rasberry praised a display of University of Arkansas tailgating equipment \u2014 coolers, grills and folding chairs \u2014 complemented by a fluttering effect created by putting electric fans beneath overhead banners for Razorbacks football. \n \n Photo \n \n \u201cSee how it pulls the eye?\u201d she asked the trainees. \u201cStep back and think about how the customer sees it.\u201d \n \n Not so good was an end display of Mr. Clean, in which the various colors of the cleaning solution were jumbled together. Lining up the bottles so they make vertical stripes of color pulls more buyers in, she said. \n \n \u201cIt may sound silly,\u201d Ms. Rasberry said, \u201cbut it works! I\u2019ve tested it myself!\u201d \n \n Back in a classroom, Walmart department managers discussed why a $15.86 bottle of Clairol hair coloring might be a bad fit for a store located in a place with an $80,000 average income. Women in that income bracket are more likely to get their hair colored at a salon, an instructor, Amanda Forslund, explained. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n This is one of the first of Walmart\u2019s planned 200 training academies. New department managers will come in for two weeks of training covering general retail principles (customer service, inventory management) as well as specialized training for their specific area (the bakery or electronics, for example). \n \n Walmart\u2019s pay increases got most of the attention. But the new training and prospect of better career paths for hourly staff members could be more significant in the long term. \n \n It\u2019s not that the retail industry doesn\u2019t offer potential paths to good incomes. Starting pay for an assistant store manager at Walmart is $48,500, and the manager of one of its large stores can make comfortably above $100,000. \n \n The problem \u2014 described by Walmart managers and people outside the company who study labor markets \u2014 is that there is no clear path for an entry-level worker to get there. Much training is impromptu, and chains have tended to view their hourly workers as interchangeable cogs rather than resources worth investing in. \n \n That reputation has been particularly strong at Walmart. \n \n \u201cI didn\u2019t used to think this would be something I would want to do, to work at Walmart,\u201d said Garrett Watts, a 22-year-old newly promoted customer service manager at a store in Fayetteville. \u201cThere\u2019s a stigma with it. It used to be, if you worked at a Walmart, it was the equivalent of a fast-food restaurant.\u201d \n \n Photo \n \n He had gone to college for two years, suspended his education and was working as a desk clerk at a hotel when he switched to Walmart this year, lured not by the starting wage but by what he had heard from a friend about the potential to rise within a giant company. He was soon promoted to department manager and runs customer services for the store. He was hired at $9 an hour and now makes $13. \n \n \u201cI wanted something that wasn\u2019t a stopgap, but could be a real career,\u201d Mr. Watts said. He is starting to set his sights on one of those $48,000-a-year assistant store manager jobs. \n \n \u2018Step in the Right Direction\u2019 \n \n Walmart\u2019s announcement of what it refers to as \u201cthe investments,\u201d made during the all-staff videoconference in 2015, became something of a Rorschach test. To macroeconomists, it suggested that a falling unemployment rate was finally creating the response that theory suggests it should: employers raising wages to attract the workers they need. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

To Wall Street analysts, it was the company owning up to the weaknesses long apparent in customer surveys and sales numbers. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n And in the company\u2019s own framing, it was about doing the right thing. \u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that one of the highest priorities today must be an investment in you, our associates,\u201d Mr. McMillon said in the video. \n \n It was all of these things, Ms. McKenna acknowledged. \n \n The improving economy made it harder for Walmart to get good workers without paying more. Political momentum toward a higher minimum wage meant that entry-level pay would soon be rising in many places anyway. And executives really had concluded that customer service woes and slumping sales were because of underinvestment in employees. \n \n To some critics, though, it still amounted to a half-measure, and one framed to maximize public attention. \u201cIn our minds this is certainly a step in the right direction, but it\u2019s typical Walmart in that it\u2019s minimal and there\u2019s a lot of spin on top of what\u2019s really happening,\u201d said Daniel Schlademan, a founder of the labor group Our Walmart, which wants the company to have a starting wage of $15 an hour. \n \n In particular, new hires typically do not receive the $10 minimum wage until they finish a training program that is supposed to take six months but frequently stretches longer. And a promised increase in the predictability and flexibility of hourly workers\u2019 schedules is being tested in only 650 smaller \u201cneighborhood market\u201d stores. It has not been rolled out to the full 4,500 Walmarts. \n \n \u201cThe economic reality is that they put a great deal of pressure on managers to keep labor costs and hours down,\u201d Mr. Schlademan said. \n \n And the actions fall well short of what Zeynep Ton, an associate professor of operations at the Sloan School of Business at M.I.T., calls a \u201cgood jobs strategy,\u201d in which a retailer builds its entire operating philosophy around better-compensated staff members who are empowered to make decisions. Companies like Costco and the grocer Wegman\u2019s have a base pay closer to that of what the retail activists seek and are successful by many measures. (Costco pays entry-level workers at least $13 an hour, with hourly pay reaching up to $22.50). \n \n But while Walmart\u2019s changes aren\u2019t as extensive as advocates would prefer, the company has shifted, in relative terms, up the industry\u2019s pay scale. In early 2014, Walmart\u2019s self-reported average full-time pay was 3.7 percent higher than the average hourly earnings for nonmanagerial workers at general merchandise stores calculated by the Labor Department. Now, it is 13.7 percent higher. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s about being competitive in the market and making sure the talent pool of applicants was the right talent pool,\u201d Ms. McKenna said. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n That sounds an awful lot like a reference to the concept of an \u201cefficiency wage.\u201d \n \n Above the Market Rate \n \n The idea is that, sometimes, it is in an employer\u2019s best interest to pay more than necessary to get a worker into a job. The 18th-century economic thinker Adam Smith described the need to pay a goldsmith particularly well to dissuade him from stealing from you. More recently, economists (including Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, who worked on these topics as an academic economist in the 1980s) have found evidence that people are more productive when they are paid above the market rate. \n \n An employee making more than the market rate, after all, is likely to work harder and show greater loyalty. Workers who see opportunities to get promoted have an incentive not to mess up, compared with people who feel they are in a dead-end job. A person has more incentive to work hard, even when the boss isn\u2019t watching, when the job pays better than what you could make down the street. \n \n Economists have found evidence of this in practice in many real-world settings. Higher pay at New Jersey police departments, for example, led to better rates of clearing cases. At the San Francisco airport, higher pay led to shorter lines for passengers. Among British home care providers, higher pay meant less oversight was needed. \n \n What is interesting about this is that, if you look at what\u2019s ailing the broader United States economy, it looks a lot like what you would expect if employers were, en masse, failing to understand the possibility of efficiency wages. \n \n Employers have succeeded at holding down labor costs. The \u201clabor share\u201d of national income \u2014 the portion of the national economic pie that goes to workers\u2019 pay, as opposed to corporate profits and elsewhere \u2014 has fallen. And average pay for nonmanagerial workers has grown more slowly than the overall economy. \n \n This has coincided with disappointing results for the economy. Worker productivity has been rising slowly for the last decade, and prime working-age Americans are staying out of the work force in droves. This implies that plenty of people don\u2019t see jobs out there that offer sufficient pay or opportunity to make the jobs worth doing. \n \n Individually, employers may think they are making rational decisions to pay people as little as possible. But that may be collectively shortsighted, if the unintended result is less demand for the goods and services they are all trying to sell to these same people. \n \n Just maybe, in other words, employers across the country are pushing down labor costs like Walmart, circa 2014 \u2014 and this is one of the major culprits behind disappointing economic results since the start of the 21st century. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n \u201cThe management philosophy that became popular in the 1980s that led companies to cut pay for low-wage workers, fight unions and contract out work may have been profitable for the companies that practiced it in the short run,\u201d said Alan Krueger, a Princeton economist and leading scholar of labor markets. \u201cBut in the long run it has raised inequality, reduced aggregate consumption and hurt overall business profitability.\u201d \n \n Customer Surveys Improve \n \n If you buy that theory \u2014 and, to be clear, it is more theory than settled fact \u2014 it means that the results of the Walmart experiment matter a great deal. That implies that if large companies were to spend more to pay and train their workers, it could create gains for the economy as a whole. And it would ultimately be better for those same businesses. \n \n Photo \n \n So, 19 months in, what is Walmart finding? \n \n Those customer surveys that were so terrible at the start of 2015 have improved, with \u201cclean, fast, friendly scores\u201d rising for 90 consecutive weeks. Surveys by outside groups, like the investment banker Cowen & Company, point to more satisfied customers as well. \n \n That seems to have done the trick in reversing the sales slump. At stores open at least a year, sales were up 1.6 percent over a year earlier in the most recent quarter. That\u2019s better than it sounds. Overall sales at general merchandise retailers are down 0.4 percent this year compared with last, according to census data. \n \n The profit landscape is less sunny. Operating income for Walmart\u2019s United States stores was down 6 percent in the most recent quarter, reflecting higher labor costs and other new investments. The company\u2019s stock has underperformed the overall United States stock market and an index of major retailers since the program was announced, suggesting investors are not convinced that these investments will pay a lucrative return anytime soon. \n \n Walmart Stock Has Lagged The retailer\u2019s share price has underperformed the market since announcing investments in worker pay and training.

You try to have the right asset. So rather than thinking about the lowest cost, the question is how do you get the best productivity.\u201d \n \n The question for Walmart, and perhaps the economy as a whole, is whether these changes turn out to be one-off, or part of a shifting philosophy of how work and compensation should work in a 21st-century megacorporation. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n \u201cOut of the gate, they\u2019ve seen some improvement, but I think that\u2019s because they were doing Retail 101 so poorly,\u201d said Brian Yarbrough, a retail analyst at Edward Jones & Company. \u201cThe better question is what happens next year and the following year. The low-hanging fruit has been harvested.\u201d \n \n Ms. McKenna declined to be specific about what might come next. And of course in a volatile corporate world, an unexpected recession or management change, or rise of a new competitor, could upend any plans. But she suggests that the company\u2019s changes should not be viewed as a one-time event. \n \n \u201cThis is a journey,\u201d she said. \n \n In the short term, the Walmart experiment shows pretty clearly that paying people better improves both the work force and the shoppers\u2019 experience, but not profitability, at least not yet. \n \n Still, here is one other nugget the company has found. The extra wages it is paying its workers don\u2019t all go out the door on payday, executives said. Spending at the stores by employees has risen \u2014 offering a possible metaphor for what those efficiency-wage economists argue might happen across the economy, if wages were to climb. ||||| So far, higher pay is hurting the retailer's profits.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The New York Times has a deep dive on how Walmart bet big on its business by investing in its employees. In 2015 the retailer quietly implemented a new focus on employee welfare, increasing pay across the board and developing programs to make the management track more accessible to employees. Although the program hasn't helped Walmart's struggling stock price, it has allowed Walmart to increase sales, increase employee satisfaction, and claw back some trust and loyalty from consumers. According to its official fact sheet, Walmart pledged $2.7 billion over two years to increasing employee pay and benefits. The NYT reports that so far, the initiative has raised the average pay for a full-time non-managerial employee to $13.69 an hour, a 16% increase since 2014 and above average pay for retail employees. However, some business leaders and analysts remain skeptical. Writing for Bloomberg, columnist Megan McArdle notes that for a large, publicly held company like Walmart, profitability looms above all. If the company's renewed focus on worker welfare doesn't start paying real, quantifiable dividends, shareholders will push for it to return to a cheaper business model, even if that means relying on fewer workers.",

She asks: Will the investments turn out to be the beginning of a change in how Walmart and other giant companies think about their workers, or just a one-off experiment to be reversed when the next recession rolls around?

His political views on women's rights, religious freedom and political pluralism mesh with Western democratic values. He is focused on the fight for democracy and human rights in Egypt. \n \n A different face of the Brotherhood is that of Mohamed Badi, 66-year-old veterinarian from the Brotherhood's conservative wing who has been the group's Supreme Guide since last January. He recently pledged the Brotherhood would \"continue to raise the banner of jihad\" against the Jews, which he called the group's \"first and foremost enemies.\" He has railed against American imperialism, and calls for the establishment of an Islamic state. \n \n Enlarge Image Close Guy Martin for the Wall Street Journal Activist Moaz Abdel Karim in Cairo \n \n After Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak stepped down on Friday amid the region's most dramatic grassroots uprising since the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the Brotherhood became poised to assume a growing role in the country's political life. The question for many is: Which Brotherhood? \n \n It was Mr. Karim and his younger, more tolerant cohorts who played a key role organizing the protests that began on Jan. 25 and ultimately unseated a 29-year president. But it's the more conservative, anti-Western old guard that still make up by far the bulk of the group's leadership. \n \n Mr. Badi, the current leader, wrote an article in September on the group's website in which he said of the U.S. that \"a nation that does not champion moral and human values cannot lead humanity, and its wealth will not avail it once Allah has had His say.\" \n \n He wrote in that same article that \"resistance is the only solution against the Zio-American arrogance and tyranny, and all we need is for the Arab and Muslim peoples to stand behind it and support it... We say to our brothers the mujahideen in Gaza: be patient, persist in [your jihad], and know that Allah is with you...\" \n \n On Monday, meanwhile, Mr. Karim stood shoulder to shoulder at a press conference with youth leaders from half a dozen mostly secular movements, to lay out their vision for how Egypt's transition to democracy should proceed and to praise the Army for cooperating. Their top demand: a unity government that includes a broad swath of opposition forces. \n \n WSJ's Farnaz Fassihi reports on continued clashes between the Iranian government and the opposition. Also, January retail sales figures will influence markets. Plus, a quick a quick look at man vs. machine on \"Jeopardy!\" \n \n The Brotherhood, whose leaders Mr. Karim butted heads with in recent weeks, put out a similar message on Saturday calling for free and fair elections. Seeking to allay fears that it would make a power grab, the Brotherhood also said it wouldn't run a candidate in presidential elections or seek a majority in parliament. \n \n Both Egyptians and outsiders, however, remain wary. They are unsure about how the group will ultimately harness any newfound political gains and whether its more-moderate wing will, in fact, have lasting clout. \n \n \"It's never entirely clear with the Brothers,\" says Josh Stacher, a political science professor at Kent State University who spent years in Egypt studying the organization. \"It's a big group, with lots of different points of view. You can find the guy always screaming about Israel and then you got the other guys who don't care about Israel because they're too busy worrying about raising literacy rates.\" \n \n Israel, which shares a long and porous border with Egypt, fears that if a moderate wing of the Brotherhood exists\u2014and many in Israel's leadership are skeptical that it does\u2014it could be shoved aside by more extreme factions within the group. \n \n The Brotherhood's conservative wing has for years put out anti-Israel comments and writings, and helped fund Hamas, the Palestinian militant group. It has also spoken out in support of attacks against U.S. soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. \n \n \"If the Muslim Brotherhood comes to power, through elections or some other way, that would be a repeat of 1979 in Iran,\" when moderate governments installed after the shah gave way to the ayatollahs, says a senior Israeli official. \"It's something we're looking at with great caution.\" \n \n Enlarge Image Close Associated Press Mohamed Badi, from the Brotherhood's conservative wing, pledged the group would 'continue to raise the banner of jihad' against the Jews. \n \n The U.S. appears to be taking a wait-and-see approach, with officials saying in recent days it should be given a chance. President Barack Obama, in an interview with Fox News, acknowledged the group's anti-American strains, but said it didn't enjoy majority support in Egypt and should be included in the political process. \"It's important for us not to say that our only two options are either the Muslim Brotherhood or a suppressed Egyptian people,\" he said. \n \n The outlawed Islamist opposition group is plagued by rifts between young and old, reformist and hard-liner. There are big city deal-making politicians, and conservative rural preachers who eschew politics in favor of proselytizing Islam. \n \n Egypt's government has long highlighted the group's hard-line wing as a threat to the country. Yet its selective crackdowns have historically empowered the very hard-liners it has sought to undermine, analysts and Brotherhood members say. \n \n The conservative leadership's autocratic leadership style within the movement, its lack of tolerance for dissenting opinions and its preference to conduct business behind closed doors have all contributed to deep skepticism among outsiders about the Brotherhood leadership's stated commitment to democracy. \n \n In recent years, meanwhile, the group's pragmatic wing has forged a historic alliance with secular opposition activists. Their role in the unseating of Mr. Mubarak appears to have given them a boost in a struggle for influence with the Brotherhood's fiery old guard. \n \n \"The Muslim Brotherhood as a whole doesn't deserve credit for this revolution, but certain factions within the movement absolutely do, generally those that have more modern views,\" says Essam Sultan, a former member of the group who left in the 1990s to form the moderate Islamist Wasat, or Centrist, Party. \"That wing should get a massive bounce out of this.\" \n \n Enlarge Image Close Guy Martin for the Wall Street Journal Muslim Brotherhood youth leader Moaz Abdel Karim helped organize demonstrations against Mr. Mubarak. \n \n Whether that bounce will be enough to propel the more-moderate Brothers to a permanent position of influence\u2014or what their legislative agenda would actually be\u2014is one of the key unknowns in Egypt's political evolution. \n \n In many ways, this faction resembles conservative right-of-center politicians elsewhere in the Arab world. They espouse a view of Islam as a part of Egyptian heritage and argue that democracy and pluralism are central Islamic values. They are pious and socially conservative, and reject the strict secularism that is a feature of most Western concepts of liberal democracy. \n \n On Wednesday, when it was still unclear whether Mr. Mubarak would step down, Essam el-Eryan, one of the only reformists currently on the group's 12-member ruling Guidance Council, said in a statement that the group didn't seek the establishment of an Islamic state; believed in full equality for women and Christians; and wouldn't attempt to abrogate the Camp David peace treaty with Israel\u2014all tenets espoused by Brotherhood leaders over the decades. Mr. el-Eryan said those Brothers who had suggested otherwise in their writings and public comments in recent days and years had been misunderstood or weren't speaking for the organization. \n \n Founded in the Suez Canal town of Ismailiya in 1928 by a 22-year-old school teacher, the organization used violence to battle the British occupation in the 1940s. \n \n The group allied with some young officers to overthrow the king in 1952 and bring Gamal Abdel Nasser to power, only to become implicated in an assassination attempt on Nasser two years later. He responded with a fierce crackdown, sending the group's leadership to prison for years, and its membership ranks into exile. \n \n The Muslim Brotherhood abandoned violence in the years that followed, formally renouncing it as a domestic strategy in 1972. But some of its offspring have taken a bloodier path. Some former members established the group responsible for the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Al-Sadat in 1981, and others have allied with Al Qaeda. \n \n In the late 1970s and early 1980s, an older generation of leftist and Islamist student activists battled each other violently on college campuses. Egypt's opposition grew increasingly ineffective, partially as a result of those rifts. \n \n \"We saw three successive generations of Brotherhood leaders fail to bring change, and we learned from their mistakes,\" says Mr. Karim, one of the leaders of the group's youth wing. \n \n Brotherhood and secular leaders say the seeds of the cooperation that drove this year's protests were planted in the early 2000s when Israel's crackdown on the second Palestinian uprising and the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq brought secularists and Islamists alike into the streets to protest a common cause. \n \n Then, in 2005, the Brotherhood struck a key victory in the parliamentary elections, winning an all-time high of 88 seats. Though officially banned, the organization is tolerated and allowed to put up candidates as independents. \n \n Many of the Brotherhood lawmakers were pragmatists compared to the hard-line members of the group who preferred to stay out of politics. They were more open to working with other groups to forge compromises, and won plaudits from secular opposition leaders by focusing their legislative efforts on fighting an extension of the country's emergency law. \n \n They also stood up for the independence of the judiciary and pushed for press freedoms, and didn't work to ban books or impose Islamic dress on women\u2014moves many critics had feared. \n \n \"In the past, Muslim Brothers in parliament sometimes made noise about racy books or the Ms. Egypt beauty pageant, and it made a lot of us uncomfortable,\" says Osama Ghazali Harb, head of the National Democratic Front, a secular opposition party. \"They didn't do this in the last five years.\" \n \n The regime responded to the Brothers' newfound parliamentary prowess with one of the most brutal crackdowns in the group's history. Instead of coming down on the organization's hard-line leaders, it focused on the movement's moderates. \n \n \"The government wants them to be secretive, hard-line, because it makes them fulfill the role of the bogey man that they're propped up to be,\" says Kent State's Mr. Stacher. \"You don't want soft and squishy huggable Islamists, and you don't want sympathetic characters. You want scary people who go on CNN and rail against Israel.\" \n \n Eighteen Brotherhood legislative staffers drafting education and health-care reform bills were among hundreds arrested. So, too, were the leading pragmatists on the movement's 12-man leadership bureau. \n \n The power vacuum was quickly filled by conservatives, who in 2007 put out a platform paper walking back many of the group's more-moderate views. \n \n It stated, for example, that neither women nor Christians were qualified to run for president. Casting further doubts on the organization's commitment to the separation of church and state, the paper called for a religious council to sign off on laws. \n \n Rifts between conservatives and reformers in the group began to flare into the open. The group's moderates argued that the paper was only a draft and never officially adopted. \n \n In the 2008 elections to the Brotherhood's Guidance Council, hard-liners nearly swept the field, according to people familiar with the group. Only one seat on the leadership council is held by a consistent reformist, say these people, as well as one of the two alternate members who would step in should someone be arrested or die. \n \n During this same period, Mr. Karim, from the Brotherhood's youth wing, says his relationships with activists in other groups were being cemented through online networks. \"The new media allowed me to connect with the other\" activists in Egypt, he says. \"And I realized that there are things we agree on, like human-rights issues and political issues.\" \n \n Past partnerships between the Brotherhood and secular parties had been top-down short-lived agreements born of political necessity. \n \n This latest alliance formed more organically, say several young activists who are working with the Brotherhood. \n \n \"We just got to know, trust and like each other, even\u2014believe it or not\u2014the Brothers,\" says Basim Kamel, a 41-year-old leader in Mohamed ElBaradei's secular movement. \n \n As conservatives were gaining influence within the Muslim Brotherhood's leadership ranks, Mr. Karim and his fellow youth cadres were growing impatient. \n \n He says they began arguing with their superiors, saying the group was losing credibility in the street because they weren't out protesting for democracy like the secular activists were. \n \n In November 2008, the Brotherhood's then-leader Mahdy Akef called for \"establishing a coalition among all political powers and civil society\" to challenge the \"tyranny that Egypt is currently witnessing.\" \n \n Mr. Akef couldn't be reached for comment, but those familiar with the group's inner workings say the shift came as the leadership realized they risked losing their youth cadres, particularly after a series of high-profile defections by young Brotherhood activists. \n \n When Mr. ElBaradei returned to Egypt in February 2010 to lead an alliance of opposition groups, many of them youth-driven, the Muslim Brotherhood backed him, formalizing a partnership that had already gelled among the rank and file. \n \n The alliance was uneasy at times. When other opposition groups voted to boycott November's parliamentary elections, for example, the Brotherhood broke ranks and ran. \n \n After the uprising in Tunisia in January, Brotherhood youth, including Mr. Karim, met with the leaders of other youth movements and decided to plan a similar uprising in Egypt. \n \n A group of about 12 youth leaders, including Mr. Karim, met secretly over the course of two weeks to figure out how to plot a demonstration that would outfox security forces. \n \n The Brotherhood's senior leadership refused to endorse their efforts at first. They ultimately agreed to allow members to participate as individuals\u2014and to forgo holding up religious slogans that the Brotherhood might have used in the past, such as \"Islam is the solution,\" or waving Korans. \n \n \u2014Summer Said in Cairo and Richard Boudreaux in Jerusalem contributed to this article. \n \n Write to Charles Levinson at charles.levinson@wsj.com ||||| Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Egypt's banned Muslim Brotherhood will apply to become a political party, it announced Tuesday. \n \n The Brotherhood \"envisions the establishment of a democratic, civil state that draws on universal measures of freedom and justice, with central Islamic values serving all Egyptians regardless of colour, creed, political trend or religion,\" it said in the statement. \n \n Although officially illegal, the Muslim Brotherhood is regarded as one of the most organized groups in Egypt. \n \n It has said it does not plan to run a candidate for president when elections are held to replace Hosni Mubarak, who resigned on Friday. \n \n Although officially illegal, the Muslim Brotherhood is regarded as one of the most organized groups in Egypt. Experts estimate the group has the support of anywhere from 10% to 30% of the population. It has said it does not plan to run a candidate for president when elections are held to replace Hosni Mubarak, who resigned on Friday. \n \n The group has sparked great controversy in the United States, where some see it as a non-violent, Islamic social welfare organization supportive of a democratic process while others call it a radical extremist group hellbent on creating a theocracy in Egypt. \n \n President Barack Obama recently downplayed the prospect of the Muslim Brotherhood playing a major role in Egypt, saying it is just one faction in Egypt that doesn't have majority support. \n \n \"There are a whole bunch of secular folks in Egypt, there are a whole bunch of educators and civil society in Egypt that want to come to the fore as well,\" the president said in an interview with Fox News. \"And it's important for us not to say that our only two options are either the Muslim Brotherhood or a suppressed Egyptian people.\" \n \n Others, however, distrust the Brotherhood's ultimate intentions. \n \n \"They are a powerful force at present, but my fear is that Islamist groups outside Egypt, seeing the opportunity in the current chaos, will flood them with support if they back an extremist view,\" said CNN national security contributor Frances Fragos Townsend, who was President George W. Bush's counterterrorism advisor. \n \n And former CIA Director Mike Hayden said the Muslim Brotherhood, as the best organized opposition group in Egypt, could \"enjoy a disproportionate power in shaping the new government. The question is: Will it become more radical?\" \n \n Still, a current U.S. official characterized the Muslim Brotherhood as being \"not as extreme as al Qaeda is.\" \n \n \"It's an organization that supports a civil state which is based in large part on Islamic law,\" said the official. \"But they do tend to eschew violence and work within the political process.\" \n \n The official cautioned about ambiguity when it comes to Egypt. \"There are lots of unknowns now with Egypt,\" said the official. \"You really can't make a call on anything, whether Mubarak is going or staying or how the Muslim Brotherhood figures into the political process. \n \n And in a recent article in the Daily Beast, former CIA analyst Bruce Riedel wrote that Americans should not fear the group. \n \n \"They should not be afraid of the Muslim Brotherhood. Living with it won't be easy, but it should not be seen as inevitably our enemy,\" said Riedel. \n \n The Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood was founded in 1928 to oppose British control of Egypt with Its goal the creation of an independent Islamic state. Although it allegedly engaged in assassination and other violence against the British and supported the coup that brought Gamal Abdel Nasser to power in 1952, the Brotherhood has been illegal since 1954, when it was convicted of attempting to assassinated Nasser, charges the group denied. \n \n Nasser ruthlessly suppressed the group, and his successors, Anwar Sadat and Hosni Mubarak, continued the repression. The Brotherhood subsequently renounced violence, is engaged in providing social services to the populace, opposes the peace treaty with Israel and supports democratic elections. \n \n On its English language website, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood calls for establishing an Islamic state in accordance with the provision of Islamic Sharia law. \n \n Ed Husain, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the Muslim Brotherhood \"ought to be a welcomed force within Egyptian politics\" if it accepts full rights for women and for religious minorities. \n \n But his colleague at the council, Isobel Coleman, said the group hasn't done that, pointing to statements by the Brotherhood that neither a woman nor a non-Muslim could ever lead Egypt. \n \n But Republican Congresswoman Sue Myrick of North Carolina worried that the government did not see the danger. \n \n \"I'm very concerned that they're using the peaceful protests in Egypt for a power grab and that we in the government doesn't seem -- we don't seem to grasp that threat in the way it concerns me,\" she said at a congressional hearing last week. \"The Brotherhood isn't a danger just because they're terrorists, but because they push an extremist ideology that causes others to commit acts of terrorism.\"' \n \n The 83-year-old organization has never been placed on the U.S. State Department's list of terrorist organizations and officially renounced violence in the 1970s. The organization was a minor player in the demonstrations that toppled Mubarak. \n \n But the U.S. chief intelligence officer raised a stir when he referred to the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood as a \"largely secular\" organization in response to a question from Myrick at the hearing. \n \n \"The term 'Muslim Brotherhood' is an umbrella term for a variety of movements, in the case of Egypt, a very heterogeneous group, largely secular, which has eschewed violence and has decried Al Qaeda as a perversion of Islam,\" said James Clapper, the director of national intelligence. \"They have pursued social ends, a betterment of the political order in Egypt.\" \n \n Clapper's office later clarified the director's comments. \n \n \"In Egypt the Muslim Brotherhood makes efforts to work through a political system that has been, under Mubarak's rule, one that is largely secular in its orientation -- (Clapper) is well aware that the Muslim Brotherhood is not a secular organization.\" \n \n CNN's Pam Benson contributed to this report",

That's certain to get a charge out of the Brotherhood's worst critics in the West, who fear the rise of a virulent anti-American Islamist party. But as the Wall Street Journal explains, the same kind of youth movement that upended the old guard of the ruling party might have the same kind of effect within the Brotherhood. It contrasts two members of the group, one a 29-year-old pro-democracy activist named Moaz Abdel Karim who worked with other opposition leaders to coordinate the Tahrir Square protests. His focus is on human rights, not jihad. The other is a 66-year-old Brotherhood leader from the group's conservative wing named Mohammed Badi who rails against Israel and American imperialism. The once-banned Brotherhood is destined to play a sizable role in the nation's future. \"The question for many,\" writes Charles Levinson, \"is which Brotherhood?\"",
    "generated_summary": "The Muslim Brotherhood, the outlawed Egyptian Islamist opposition group, is plagued by rifts. A different face of the Brotherhood is that of Mohamed Badi, 66, who has been the group's Supreme Guide since last January. It was Mr. Karim and his younger, more tolerant cohorts who played a key role organizing the protests that began on Jan. 25. But it's the more conservative, anti-Western old guard that still make up by far the bulk of the group\u2019s leadership. The Brotherhood's conservative wing has for years put out anti-Israel comments, helped fund Hamas and helped fund the Palestinian militant group.",

To fulfill that goal, the company will ship the new Kinect \u2014 its motion-sensing and listening peripheral \u2014 with every Xbox One. The new console uses the new Kinect for just about everything: switching between games, movies, web browsing, and live television, all of which can be done with voice commands. (In fact, the new console needs the Kinect to operate at all \u2014 it's not an optional add-on like with the Xbox 360.) Even when the console's turned off, users can simply say \"Xbox On\" to power up \u2014 which means the new Kinect will be listening to you in your living room at all times. \n \n I think it's creepy that you can say \"Xbox on\" and it will turn on. It means it's always listening to you. \u2014 Jack Lloyd (@RedDeadLloyd) May 21, 2013 \n \n Kinect on the Xbox One is always listening/watching and has a constant connection to the Internet. 1984 anyone? \u2014 James Philippon (@jamesphilippon) May 21, 2013 \n \n In fact, the new camera and microphone system is so sensitive to your presence, that Microsoft says the new Kinect can even read your heartbeat while you're exercising, and recognize and process audio that's personalized to specific individuals. \"This is rocket science level stuff,\" Xbox's Marc Whitten said during today's reveal. \n \n Microsoft claims the new Kinect is so sensitive that it can read your heartbeat and recognize individual voices \n \n Of course, that's not necessarily a gloom-and-doom situation, and listening doesn't mean recording. Still, compared to privacy concerns over a device like Google Glass, which doesn't actively listen to its surroundings at all times, the new Xbox could pose greater privacy implications \u2014 especially if the system, which many users will connect to the internet, is compromised remotely by a malicious actor. \"If I'm recording you, I have to stare at you \u2014 as a human being,\" Google Glass engineer Charles Mendis told The Verge when asked about Glass' privacy concerns. \"And when someone is staring at you, you have to notice.\" But will you notice a fixed camera in your living room that's always listening? \n \n This isn't the first time Kinect has faced privacy concerns \n \n This isn't the first time Microsoft has dealt with privacy issues related to Kinect. When the first iteration of Kinect headed to the market in 2010, Microsoft's Dennis Durken suggested to investors that the peripheral might pass data to advertisers about how you look, play, and speak. \"We can cater what content gets presented to you based on who you are,\" he said, sparking privacy concerns. (Microsoft later denied that the Kinect would use information for targeted advertising.) But even then, the first Kinect was only enabled in specific situations, and didn't have an always-on listening mode. \n \n Microsoft provided few additional details on how the new Kinect will work, but the company did mention that the system will run in an extremely low-power state for listening mode, meaning that the device's operating system and certain hardware features could be disabled in that state. \n \n We've asked Microsoft to clarify the technical specifics of how the system operates in listening mode, and if the company has considered any safeguards against potential privacy threats. \n \n Update: A Microsoft spokesperson responded to our inquiry with the following statement. \n \n The new Kinect is listening for a specific cue, like \u2018Xbox on.\u2019 We know our customers want and expect strong privacy protections to be built into our products, devices and services, and for companies to be responsible stewards of their data. Microsoft has more than ten years of experience making privacy a top priority. Kinect for Xbox 360 was designed and built with strong privacy protections in place and the new Kinect will continue this commitment. \n \n Update 2: Microsoft CVP Phil Harrison told Eurogamer that the company has no plans to spy on you:",

    "document": "Espa\u00f1ol \n \n Subscribe: FDA Consumer Health Information \n \n After an exhaustive and rigorous scientific review, FDA has arrived at the decision that AquAdvantage salmon is as safe to eat as any non-genetically engineered (GE) Atlantic salmon, and also as nutritious. \n \n FDA\u2019s Review of the GE Salmon \n \n The FDA scientists rigorously evaluated extensive data submitted by the manufacturer, AquaBounty Technologies, and other peer-reviewed data, to assess whether AquAdvantage salmon met the criteria for approval established by law; namely, safety and effectiveness. The data demonstrated that the inserted genes remained stable over several generations of fish, that food from the GE salmon is safe to eat by humans and animals, that the genetic engineering is safe for the fish, and the salmon meets the sponsor\u2019s claim about faster growth. \n \n In addition, FDA assessed the environmental impacts of approving this application and found that the approval would not have a significant impact on the environment of the United States. That\u2019s because the multiple containment measures the company will use in the land-based facilities in Panama and Canada make it extremely unlikely that the fish could escape and establish themselves in the wild. \n \n Labeling Food Containing Ingredients Derived from Genetically Engineered Sources \n \n At the same time, many consumers also want to know whether their food or any ingredients in their food is derived from genetically engineered sources. Although the law does not require food containing ingredients derived from these salmon to be labeled as GE, FDA recognizes that many consumers are interested in this information, and some food manufacturers will want to make the distinction. \n \n FDA is releasing two guidance documents detailing the agency\u2019s current thinking on labeling\u2014a draft guidance for labeling of food derived from Atlantic salmon that has or has not been genetically engineered and a final guidance for labeling of food that has or has not been derived from GE plants\u2014to help those manufacturers who wish to voluntarily make the distinction on the labeling of their food products. \n \n \u201cBoth guidance documents explain FDA\u2019s best thinking on how to make it easy for consumers to know whether a food was produced using genetic engineering or not,\u201d says Felicia Billingslea, B.S., M.S., director of FDA\u2019s Division of Food Labeling and Standards. \n \n The public is invited to provide comments on this draft guidance (see box below). Consumers can also learn more about how a food is produced by contacting the manufacturer, Billingslea says. \n \n How to Comment on the Draft Guidance To comment on the draft guidance on voluntary labeling indicating whether food has or has not been derived from GE Atlantic salmon: Read the Draft Guidance. Starting Tuesday, November 24, submit comments on the draft guidance on Regulations.gov. Comment Now The comment period closes January 25, 2016. \n \n November 19, 2015 \n \n back to top ||||| \n \n This photo provided by AquaBounty Technologies shows two same-age salmon, a genetically modified salmon, rear, and a non-genetically modified salmon, foreground. (AP/AquaBounty Technologies) \n \n After years of review and endless controversy, the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday approved the nation's first genetically altered animal -- a salmon engineered to grow twice as fast as its natural counterpart. \n \n AquAdvantage, produced by Massachusetts-based AquaBounty, is an Atlantic salmon that contains a growth hormone from a Chinook salmon and has been given a gene from the ocean pout, an eel-like fish. The result is a fish that is large enough for consumption in about a year and a half, rather than the typical three years. \n \n Food-safety activists, environmental groups and the salmon fishing industry, not to mention lawmakers from Alaska, have long opposed the approval of the fish -- which they derisively refer to as \"Frankenfish\" -- and have argued that its existence could open the door to a broad range of potentially unsafe genetically modified animal foods. Knowing an FDA approval was likely, critics have in recent years won commitments from some of the nation's most recognizable chains \u2014 including Whole Foods, Trader Joe\u2019s and Target \u2014 to not sell the fish. \n \n [A new method against genetically modified salmon: Get retailers to refuse to sell it] \n \n The FDA said Thursday that its decision was \"based on sound science and a comprehensive review,\" and that regulators are confident that the genetically altered fish is as safe to eat as a normal Atlantic salmon, with no discernible difference in its nutritional value. Officials noted that the agency held meetings, combed through thousands of public comments and conducted scientific and environmental assessments about the AquaBounty fish before finally approving it. \n \n \"All of that took time,\" said Laura Epstein, a senior policy analyst in the FDA's center for veterinary medicine. \"As with many products that are the first of their kind, we're very careful to be sure we're getting everything right.\" \n \n Salmon fishermen and environmental activists have raised concerns about the havoc that could occur if any of AquaBounty's engineered salmon made it into ocean waters and mated with wild Atlantic salmon -- a scenario they say could have unpredictable impacts and lead to the decimation of wild populations. AquaBounty has said its fish are all female and sterile, making it impossible for them to breed with other salmon, even if they somehow were to escape their land-locked production facilities. The company argues its fish actually could reduce pressure on wild fish stocks and prevent the overfishing of Atlantic salmon. \n \n The FDA said Thursday it will require the AquaBounty salmon to be raised only in land-based, contained tanks in two specific facilities in Canada and Panama, and that it will conduct regular inspections. The approval also doesn't allow the salmon to be bred or raised in the United States for now, though FDA officials said the company could apply to have other production sites approved in the future. \n \n Critics have argued that an FDA approval of AquaBounty\u2019s salmon could open the floodgates for other genetically engineered animals, each with its own health and environmental concerns. \n \n \"It was a flawed and irresponsible approval ... It sets a very dangerous precedent, given our federal government agencies are ill-equipped to handle genetically engineered animals,\" said Dana Perls, food and technology campaigner at Friends of the Earth, an international network of environmental organizations that has vehemently fought AquaBounty's efforts. \"I think it is a grave mistake we will come to regret.\" \n \n [Genetically altered salmon are safe, FDA says] \n \n Perls said her group and others would continue to try to undermine the market for the fish. \"It\u2019s clear: People don\u2019t want to eat it,\" she said. \"We\u2019re going to continue to work with grocery stores and retailers to continue to listen to consumers who don\u2019t want to eat this under-studied, unlabeled GMO fish.\" \n \n Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska) has long opposed the AquaBounty fish, saying that its existence would threaten a mainstay industry of his state. He repeatedly has pushed for delays in the FDA approval process, telling the Post in a 2012 interview that he hoped such hurdles eventually would \"break that company.\" \n \n \"This harebrained decision goes to show that our federal agencies are incapable of using common sense,\" Young said in a statement Thursday. \"By embarking on this science experiment, the FDA ignores fundamental risk questions related to our wild fish species and food safety.\" \n \n Others welcomed the FDA approval Thursday, none more than the company that has spent two decades developing genetically engineered salmon. \"We're thrilled,\" AquaBounty chief executive Ron Stotish said when reached on his cell phone early Thursday. \"We think this is good for science, we think it's good for aquaculture, we think it's good for consumers.\" \n \n Stotish took over at the helm in 2008 at AquaBounty, which he said now employees 21 people, and is acutely aware of the fierce opposition among many activists to the firm's genetically engineered salmon. But he said he hopes to win over critics in time. \n \n \"We hope they understand that we understand their concerns. And we've developed a product that mitigates many of the concerns they share and we share,\" he said. \"I hope people take the time to consider the fact that we are an environmentally sustainable product, and that this might actually be a better way to grow salmon ... We hope people consider it on its merits.\" \n \n Another issue certain to remain controversial as the genetically engineered salmon moves closer to U.S. dinner tables: Labeling. \n \n The FDA said Thursday that it can require additional labeling of genetically engineered foods only if \"there is a material difference -- such as a different nutritional profile\" between the genetically engineered food and its natural counterpart. In the case of the AquaAdvantage salmon, the FDA found no such differences. Thus, the agency won't require a special label, despite the outcry from consumer and health advocates who say that Americans should know if the salmon they are buying has been genetically altered. \n \n On a conference call with reporters Thursday, FDA officials were asked how consumers eventually would be able to discern between the AquaBounty salmon and any other salmon in the grocery aisle. \"[Looking for] 'wild caught' salmon would be one way you could ensure you are not eating genetically engineered salmon,\" said Larisa Rudenko, senior adviser for biotechnology in the agency's center for veterinary medicine. \n \n Greg Jaffe, director of biotechnology at the advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest, said Thursday's approval is unlikely to impact U.S. consumers, at least in the short term. Even when AquaBounty cranks up its production to full capacity, he said, the hundreds of tons of genetically engineered salmon it could produce annually will amount to a tiny fraction of the massive market for salmon in the United States. \n \n \"It\u2019s not going to be on the shelf tomorrow,\" said Jaffe, who agrees with the FDA that the genetically engineered salmon would be perfectly safe to eat. \"This is not something you have to try hard to avoid. It's actually going to be hard to find.\" \n \n This post has been updated. \n \n Read more: \n \n Who still smokes in the United States \u2014 in seven simple charts \n \n Why groundbreaking new cancer drugs still don\u2019t work for most patients \n \n Cantaloupes to cauliflower, pineapples to plantains: FDA finalizes first federal safety rules for produce \n \n Nearly 60 percent of Americans \u2014 the highest rate ever \u2014 are taking prescription drugs \n \n 7 country study on fairness: Kids everywhere can't stand getting less -- but in some places they don't like getting more \n \n Groundbreaking face transplant: After a firefighter was injured on duty, a deceased 26-year-old cyclist gave him his life back \n \n For more health news, you can sign up for our weekly newsletter here.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The FDA made history Thursday when, for the first time ever, it approved a genetically altered animal for human consumption, the Washington Post reports. After two decades of what the FDA calls \"exhaustive and rigorous scientific review\" the AquAdvantage salmon will be hitting supermarket seafood cases. According to ABC News, the AquAdvantage is an Atlantic salmon with a Chinook salmon growth hormone that allows it to grow all year and a gene from the eel-like ocean pout to activate that growth hormone. Basically this means the AquAdvantage will be big enough to eat in a year and a half instead of the three years required for a normal Atlantic salmon. The AquAdvantage is a \"game changer\"\u2014nutritious food that's environmentally responsible, says Ron Stotish, CEO of AquaBounty, which makes the genetically altered salmon. The Post reports the approval of the AquAdvantage was opposed by everyone from food-safety activists to the salmon fishing industry. \"I think it is a grave mistake we will come to regret,\" says one environmental group representative. Opponents call the AquAdvantage a \"frankenfish\" (though technically it would be a \"Frankenfish's monster,\" but that's neither here nor there) and worry it could get loose and destroy the wild Atlantic salmon population. AquaBounty assures opponents that all its salmon are bred female and sterile, making their survival in the wild impossible (which sounds ominously familiar). According to ABC, laws don't require stores to label the AquAdvantage, and it's likely consumers won't even know they're eating it. Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Target, and others have already vowed not to sell the genetically altered salmon, the Post reports.",
    "generated_summary": "FDA: AquAdvantage salmon is as safe to eat as any non-genetically engineered (GE) Atlantic salmon. Law does not require food containing ingredients derived from these salmon to be labeled as GE.

    "document": "Sean Penn Charged in Latest Photographer Dustup \n \n Email This Oscar-winning actor \n \n \n \n Frank Mateljan of the Los Angeles city attorney's office said prosecutors are alleging the star kicked a photographer and then broke his camera. \n \n \n \n The incident was Oscar-winning actor Sean Penn has been hit with battery and vandalism charges stemming from an encounter with a photographer outside a Brentwood store in October. If convicted, Penn could face up to 18 months in jail.Frank Mateljan of the Los Angeles city attorney's office said prosecutors are alleging the star kicked a photographer and then broke his camera.The incident was captured by TMZ and shows the actor charging towards the photographer, taking a punch and kick while shouting \"get out!\" and continuing his pursuit as the man doggedly keeps filming. Nowhere in the footage does the camera leave the photog's hands. \n \n The actor, who resides in San Francisco, will be arraigned in Los Angeles County Superior Court on March 22. Penn's people have not been reached for comment.Twenty-five years ago, Penn received a suspended sentence after pleading guilty for attacking two British journalists trying to snap pics of his then-wife Madonna. He also got punchy in 1987 with a movie extra on the set of 'Colors.'Lately, Penn has been spending time in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, attempting to highlight the need for more aid in the earthquake-leveled nation. ||||| One year after the devastating Jan. 12 earthquake, how Sean Penn, Paul Haggis, Maria Bello and their friends are still fighting for Haiti\u2019s survival amid unspeakable horror. \n \n It\u2019s Christmas Eve in Haiti, and while the rest of the world is slowing down, Sean Penn is speeding up. \n \n His fingers gripped tight on the handrail of a mud-splattered SUV, gulping cigarette smoke like oxygen, he\u2019s wiry, intense, haggard, his hooded eyes alert to every move, emotions clenched tight as a fist, as his car lurches through a hilly slum, ironically named Bel Air. PHOTOS: Sean Penn's Haiti home. \n \n Half-naked children clamber around the crumbling shacks. A family stews food on the porch of a building stamped with red letters, meaning it\u2019s destined for demolition \u2014 only the place is still here, and so is the family. \n \n It\u2019s a bad set designer\u2019s version of the apocalypse, except that it\u2019s real \u2014 especially for Penn, 50, who\u2019s been a fixture in Haiti since moving here almost immediately after the Jan. 12, 2010, earthquake that threw the country into chaos, and the actor\u2019s own life, too. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s a great thing Paul Newman said about his long marriage,\u201d he says wryly. \u201c \u2018As it turns out, we still love each other.\u2019 That\u2019s how I feel: \u2018As it turns out, I\u2019m still here.\u2019 \u201d \n \n He cracks a rare smile as we approach a small, newly erected school for about 300 children. Penn is here to meet its founder, a Haitian-American event producer funding the endeavor from his New York base who\u2019s come to see the result, his exquisite Tunisian girlfriend in tow. \n \n An enigmatic businessman. A 6-foot model. A school that\u2019s open on Christmas Eve. It\u2019s enough to make anyone wary, let alone the genetically cautious Penn. \n \n \u201cHe wants us to contribute what we\u2019ve got, a heavy-equipment team and a civil engineer,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s a lot of people, and you don\u2019t know where they\u2019re coming from.\u201d \n \n Given this, it\u2019s hardly a surprise that Penn holds back when the man, Unik Ernest, greets him warmly and leads him into the rough-and-tumble building. As we make our way through crevice-like hallways, he shows us a giant bowl of rice that provides these kids with one solid meal per day \u2014 a miracle in this impoverished town \u2014 and ushers us into a cramped classroom where nearly 50 children squeal with delight at seeing Penn. \n \n Not Penn the actor: Penn the humanist. Penn the leader of a camp that houses 55,000 displaced persons. Penn the man whose rubble-busting machinery might turn this squalor into \n \n something bordering on the human. \n \n One by one, the girls line up to kiss him. If Penn hesitates \u2014 he\u2019s hardly the kiss-and-cuddle type, and cholera is a clear and present danger \u2014 he kisses them on the cheek nonetheless, with a disarming gentleness. \n \n Then the girls sing: \u201cWe wish you a merry Christmas. We wish you a merry Christmas. We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year!\u201d \n \n [pullquote] \n \n It will be a happy New Year for the kids. \u201cWe have a deal,\u201d Penn tells Ernest. \u201cWe\u2019ll make it happen.\u201d \n \n Doing so will mean bulldozing about four or five blocks. It also will mean working with a young man who has been lurking in the shadows. Small, with a lost gaze and listless manner, he seems rather sweet; it\u2019s only later that I learn he runs one of the deadliest gangs in town. \n \n \u201cThere are a lot of killers,\u201d Penn shrugs. \u201cBut there\u2019s fallibility in leadership by fear. So we sit down and go, \u2018Your guy here, he brought us in, he cares,\u2019 and he gets more power. It\u2019s a lot better than threatening them with a machete.\u201d \n \n Machetes are not the average Hollywood star\u2019s stock in trade. But no one has ever called Penn average, any more than the other Hollywood celebrities fighting for Haiti. \n \n Nearly a year since George Clooney\u2019s Hope for Haiti Now telethon raised $66 million for such organizations as Oxfam America, Partners in Health, the American Red Cross and UNICEF, several dozen Hollywood players have defied cynicism and are plunging into relief work, made harder by a recent hurricane and the cholera epidemic spreading into the capital of Port-au-Prince. \n \n They range from Patricia \n \n Arquette, whose Give Love foundation is working on better sanitation and sending container homes for the displaced; to Ben Stiller, who\u2019s building six schools through his Stiller Foundation; to Mel Gibson, the much-maligned star who quietly arranged a plane to ferry medical supplies. \n \n While Hollywood activists frequently raise eyebrows among professionals, this group draws praise. \n \n The telethon funds were allocated \u201cbrilliantly,\u201d says Lisa Szarkowski, a spokesperson for UNICEF USA, which received $11 million. \u201cThey had us submit proposals for how we would spend that money. It was a really smart way of going about this.\u201d \n \n But while the NGOs are positive about Hollywood, Hollywood is anything but positive about many organizations working in Haiti. The United Nations, in particular, earns Penn\u2019s wrath. \n \n Hidden behind fortresslike walls, with armed guards posted on lookout at night, it\u2019s one of the few moderately lit places in a city that\u2019s engulfed in darkness, where locals pass through the surrounding streets like ghosts. \n \n Penn sniffs at \u201cthe amount we\u2019re getting done, versus what they\u2019re doing \u2014 which is nothing. Quite honestly, if you want something done, do it yourself.\u201d \n \n Says Szarkowski: \u201cI\u2019m sure there are organizations that deserve to be criticized, and maybe celebrities, too. But everybody is doing their best.\u201d \n \n Paul Haggis, 58, is one of them. \n \n The writer-director of Crash was among the first industry figures to become interested in Haiti, back in 2008 when he learned about the work of the Rev. Rick Frechette, a priest and doctor who had been toiling \u201cfor 20 years in the slums,\u201d he recalls. \u201cHe\u2019d just finished building a new children\u2019s hospital, and I said, \u2018I have to go see him.\u2019 So I hopped on a plane and went to find him.\u201d \n \n Soon after, Haggis established Artists for Peace and Justice to spearhead educational efforts, probably the most active Hollywood-based nonprofit beside Penn\u2019s J/P Haitian Relief Organization. He has since persuaded more than 15 celebrities to pledge $50,000 a year for the next five years. \n \n He vividly remembers learning about the earthquake itself. \u201cI was sitting in my editing room in New York,\u201d he says. \u201cI started making some calls and put a little over $150,000 together, and I walked through SoHo with it in a brown paper bag.\u201d \n \n Later, \u201cThe State Department said they knew of someone flying a small plane out of Florida. So I went and waited. After a couple of days, I got on a plane, but it was turned around. There were so many flights coming in, the army had shut down the airport in Port-au-Prince.\u201d \n \n That\u2019s when he heard Penn had booked two planes, one for 30 passengers and supplies, the other purely for cargo, and flew with him. When he arrived, \u201cThey\u2019d imploded \u2014 the people, the bodies. It was horror upon horror upon horror. It looked like Dresden after the war.\u201d \n \n Tron: Legacy star Olivia Wilde experienced her own post-earthquake trauma. \n \n Arriving around the same time as Haggis, she witnessed \u201csurgery on a 3-year-old girl whose hand had been bitten by rats, because she was living in one of the tent camps, which were completely overrun.\u201d The girl was brought to the Saint Damien Hospital, where her hand was stitched to avoid amputation. \u201cI was struck by the terror, the sheer terror of this little girl before she was put to sleep,\u201d Wilde says. \u201cShe had no idea where she was.\u201d \n \n Today, many Americans barely know where Haiti is, and even fewer remain invested in the aftermath of the quake. \n \n As the world approaches the one-year anniversary of the 7.0 temblor, a quick scan online and on TV finds scant information. When Penn called me just before I flew out, warning that riots linked to the current elections might shut down the airport, there was very little to be found about it in any mainstream media. And when word spread that locals had been lynched \u2014 a response to rumors that witch doctors had caused the cholera \u2014 the news couldn\u2019t be seen on any U.S. television broadcast. \n \n Which perhaps explains why Maria Bello, another prominent Haiti supporter, brings a veritable media posse with her, including a video crew and a blogger from the Huffington Post, when she flies in two days after Christmas. \n \n \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 \n \n It\u2019s mid-morning and Bello, 43, is squeezed into a sweltering conference room with about 20 locals in the administrative offices of Cit\u00e9 Soleil, the most notorious Port-au-Prince slum. \n \n A large, middle-aged Haitian woman is leading a colloquy of slum leaders as they talk to Bello and some of her aides from We Advance, a pro-women nonprofit she\u2019s created. The woman is Barbara Guillaume, 49, a folk singer, former exile and current mayoral candidate. \n \n At first, it\u2019s just officials speechifying. And then one of the speakers addresses the problem of rape, how girls under age 18 \u2014 some as young as 2 \u2014 are victimized in the poorly lit slums and often too ashamed to come forward. Then another woman joins in, and another, and soon a local rapper is cheering them on, everyone\u2019s pitching in, and it\u2019s all the strong-minded actress can do to maintain order. \n \n She urges them to provide contact information \u2014 everyone appears to have a cell phone, no matter how poor \u2014 and assures them: \u201cI\u2019m not Haitian, but this is my second home. Still, it\u2019s you who have the power to change your country.\u201d \n \n Afterward, as we tour Cit\u00e9 Soleil, heading toward a women\u2019s clinic Bello has set up that will open next week, I speak to Guillaume. \n \n For a woman whose life has been under siege because of her outspoken politics and who has been physically attacked, she\u2019s remarkably calm. \u201cI have a lot of hope for Cit\u00e9 Soleil,\u201d she explains, strolling past shacks made of cinder blocks and corrugated iron. \n \n But danger is ever present. She recalls how \u201cthe people now in power crushed my car. Young people came armed while I was inside.\u201d They started to batter the vehicle, smashing its windows. \u201cLuckily, a young man climbed up on the car and said, \u2018If you\u2019re going to kill her, you\u2019re going to kill me too.\u2019 \u201d \n \n Was she afraid? No, she says. \u201cI\u2019m already dead. My mother, my parents already say that: \u2018She\u2019s dead.\u2019 When you live in Haiti and want to sacrifice yourself for the country, for the downtrodden, you have to think of yourself as dead.\u201d \n \n It\u2019s a view that contrasts starkly with Guillaume\u2019s colleague, Sister Marcella, 47, a down-to-earth Italian nun who has spent the past five years in the slum and whose own clinic has treated 1,200 cholera victims in recent weeks alone. Many have died, and more will if the cholera sweeping from the southeast further impacts the city. \n \n We pause at the entrance to her little building, and I can\u2019t help noticing that a bleach tray outside, designed to be stepped in to kill the disease, is almost empty. Has all this death and destruction shaken the sister\u2019s faith? \n \n Just the opposite, she says. A year ago, \u201cMy mother died, so I flew to Italy. That was hours before the earthquake. My mother saved me.\u201d \n \n She smiles. \u201cThe problem isn\u2019t God, it\u2019s the heart of man.\u201d \n \n \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 \n \n The heart of man is alive and well in Jacmel, a seaside city about 25 miles from Port-au-Prince, where a tiny film school has been founded by documentarian David Belle. The video crew trailing Bello trained here, so I set out to find it. \n \n The road to Jacmel is long and winding; it takes me through Grand Rue, the most spectacularly devastated street of Port-au-Prince, where building after building looks as if it\u2019s been bombed, then over lush green mountains, until, two-and-a-half hours later, I finally reach Jacmel, where a cliffside diving school has become the school\u2019s headquarters. \n \n The facilities are rudimentary: There are only five video cameras for several dozen students, and one is broken. But the students\u2019 love of the place is palpable, which becomes clear when I meet Kaziah Jean, 26. \n \n Unsure of her future, she was blown away when she saw a documentary Belle had made about a Haitian midwife, shown at the first Jacmel Film Festival in 2004. \u201cThese were films we weren\u2019t used to seeing,\u201d she marvels. \u201cIt was really stunning to see films about our people.\u201d \n \n Flush with enthusiasm, Kaziah tried to track Belle down. \u201cI followed him everywhere,\u201d she says. \u201cBut he was in a car; I wanted to speak to him, but I couldn\u2019t.\u201d \n \n The following year, she enrolled in a free two-week class about moviemaking \u2014 and fell in love. When Belle subsequently set up his film school, supported by Haggis and Sofia and Francis Ford Coppola, she applied. \n \n The response from her family was hardly what she expected. \u201cMy mother and older brother were against it,\u201d Kaziah admits. Her parents were Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, and besides, \u201cwanted me to enroll in a proper university.\u201d \n \n The school has become her life. Haggis arranged for her and other students to work on the post-earthquake video We Are the World, and she\u2019s made a living assisting foreign news crews. \n \n \u201cNow my family is glad,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m supporting them all.\u201d \n \n \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 \n \n Sean Penn is supporting 55,000 more. \n \n Back in Port-au-Prince, he walks me through the J/P HRO camp in Petionville, a once-affluent suburb, that has become his obsession. He pauses to look over what was previously a nine-hole golf club spread across several hills; it\u2019s now sprinkled with 11,000 tarp-covered structures housing the displaced persons he and his group of about 50 volunteers and trained professionals oversee, along with a Haitian staff of 108. \n \n The camp has become a veritable city of its own. There\u2019s a medical unit whose hospital stays open 24/7; a tent where cholera victims are hooked to IV\u2019s; an outdoor market; and even a red-light district \u2014 though neither red lights nor clients are present right now. \n \n \u201cThis is SOP, standard operating procedure,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cWhen those things take place, it\u2019s the beginning of economies.\u201d Then he quips, \u201cI know I\u2019m going to have feminists screaming at me.\u201d \n \n \u25baWHAT IS CHOLERA? The waterborne sickness is tearing through Haiti Cholera, a bacteria, is spread through contaminated water. The diarrhea it causes leads to dehydration that can easily be cured but only if treated rapidly \u2014 the biggest challenge for Haitians, especially in rural areas, who often live miles from medical care. By mid-December, more than 91,000 Haitians had been sickened by the disease and more than 2,000 had died, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \n \n As Penn walks on, a gun safely concealed inside his pants, children run up to greet him. \u201cHey you!\u201d they call, or \u201cseanpenn!\u201d One leads me inside a tent \u2014 the local movie theater, where a television rigged to electrical wires hanging from trees shows a Jackie Chan picture, the screening times posted outside. \n \n Things like this elic it a smile from Penn. One of the 40-plus workers who share his nearby house laughs at his flashes of dark humor, recalling the time when he brought home a battery-operated tarantula and set it crawling across the floor. \n \n Still, there\u2019s an intensity to him, a profound seriousness that is his predominant mode and that\u2019s what led him here in the first place. \n \n After getting a text from a friend right after the earthquake alerting him, \u201cOh God, poor Haiti,\u201d Penn started manning the phone. Within days, he had booked the two planes and arranged for doctors and medical supplies to accompany him. \n \n \u201cThe airport was chaos,\u201d he says. \u201cAs soon as you landed, another plane came in. The military was pulling off pallets, then they\u2019d meet the next plane. Everything was going in all directions. And there\u2019d been the big aftershock, so the port was closed.\u201d \n \n Penn stayed in a friend\u2019s backyard, sending his doctors to one of the hospitals and speaking to Paul Farmer, the founder of Partners in Health, who \u201cgave us a good map\u201d of what to do. \n \n Soon, he learned that some 35,000 locals had sought refuge at the golf club, where the military\u2019s 82nd Airborne was based. Penn asked to be of service. \u201cThey said, \u2018You can stay if you\u2019re effective. If you stop being effective, we kick you out.\u2019 \u201d He was so effective, he became camp manager. \n \n At first, he says, he was promised $1 million from an entrepreneur, (the \u201cJ\u201d in J/P HRO). But, he adds, most of the money never materialized and he ended up spending chunks of his own. \n \n \u201cI started paying for stuff,\u201d he notes, \u201cand that was when I thought, \u2018OK, I better figure this out, because at this burn rate I\u2019ll last about a week and a half.\u2019 \u201d \n \n Now Penn has received help from Oxfam and Save the Children, among other aid organizations. But the $450,000 a month it costs to run the camp \u2014 even more when heavy equipment is needed \u2014 is always perilously close to running out. \n \n Security is critical. On one occasion, a gang from Cit\u00e9 Soleil heard the camp had received $80,000. Penn and his colleagues had to hold the gangsters at bay, though he won\u2019t say how. As to the gang members in his camp, \u201cWe hardball the shit out of them,\u201d he says. \u201cOne incident happens, and it\u2019s an immediate hardcore response.\u201d \n \n Penn\u2019s own hardcore response is harder to understand. \n \n He claims \u201cI didn\u2019t have commitments, except for way in the future; I had nothing pressing,\u201d as if this will make everything clear. But he admits, \u201cI got practical issues, like everybody. I had two federal cases against me at the time, and one criminal one,\u201d he says, referring to charges for illegal trips to Cuba and assaulting a paparazzo. Also, he says, about his former wife Robin Wright, \u201cI had just got taken for one half of everything I had in the divorce, so it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t have to work.\u201d \n \n He says the divorce impacted him much more than his move to Haiti. \u201cA much more profound change in life for me personally was not being able to raise my son in a whole family through high school,\u201d he professes bitterly. \n \n He describes how his involvement in Hurricane Katrina paved the way for this. But deeper motives are never addressed. \u201cWhen I first came to Haiti, the decision was to go for two weeks,\u201d he says. In fact, it\u2019s been a whole year. \n \n If he seems perpetually tired, who can blame him? He\u2019s ordering supplies, arranging funds, supervising staff and figuring out what to do if a hurricane hits, as it almost did just weeks ago. Deep gashes of sleep deprivation line his face. His eyes seem half-closed with fatigue. And yet he keeps on going, chain-smoking his American Spirits like lifesavers. \n \n \u201cHe\u2019s crazy,\u201d says one of his volunteers. \u201dHe\u2019s a genius,\u201d says another. \n \n Recently, after spending most of his time in Haiti, he has started to take breaks, alternating a few days in Malibu with a few days here.

Nude photographs of Prince Harry in a Las Vegas, USA, hotel... (Associated Press) \n \n A prominent British public relations guru said Friday he'd been approached by two women who claimed to have more material on Prince Harry, raising the possibility that the world may soon be seeing more compromising images of the British royal. \n \n Earlier this week, celebrity gossip website TMZ published photos of Harry romping in the nude during a party at his Las Vegas hotel suite. Many Britons have laughed off the 27-year-old prince's hijinks, but questions have been raised about his publicly-funded security detail. \n \n In a telephone interview, publicist Max Clifford said he had been called by two American women who claim they were in the prince's hotel room in the U.S. last week. Clifford, a savvy operator famous for negotiating kiss-and-tell interviews, said the women \"said they had lots of interesting things: pictures, video, that kind of thing.\" \n \n He said he turned them down. \n \n \"I couldn't justify this,\" he said. \"It's an infringement of his privacy. That's why I said no.\" \n \n On Thursday, TMZ claimed that \"several girls\" had taken pictures at the party using their cellphones as the party got started and that \"more photos were taken\" after the clothes came off. Neither TMZ nor Clifford has made clear whether they believe the unreleased photographs show the prince in the nude. \n \n British publications have largely steered clear of the photographs, with the prominent exception of Rupert Murdoch's The Sun tabloid, which became the first paper to splash the pictures across its front page on Friday with the words: \"HEIR IT IS!\" and marketing the grainy photograph as a \"souvenir printed edition.\" \n \n The paper said it had defied the wishes of the royal family because there was a public interest in knowing what the prince, who represented the queen at the 2012 Olympic Games and is heavily involved in charity work, got up to while abroad. \n \n Privacy lawyer Chris Hutchings said that the paper's public interest argument could have traction. \n \n \"The public interest argument is on the basis that Prince Harry represents this country around the world and the photos bring into question his suitability to act as a British ambassador,\" Hutchings said, although he added: \"The Sun have taken a calculated risk in publishing the photos given their inherently private nature.\" \n \n As of Friday, the palace hasn't made any official complaint.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Despite the fact that anyone from the UK could have gone to TMZ.com and seen the naked pictures of Prince Harry, the snaps were kept off British media websites and newspapers\u2014until now. The Sun went ahead and published the photos, even though the royal family's lawyers specifically asked it not to. The paper likes Harry and \"is NOT making any moral judgment\" about his behavior, it explains. It simply believes \"Sun readers have a right to see them.\" Why? Because the photos have sparked a debate about Harry's lifestyle, considering he officially represents Britain, and thus any Brits without Internet access could not fully take part in that conversation. \"There is a clear public interest in publishing the Harry pictures, in order for the debate around them to be fully informed.\" More on Harry: The prince was pictured hugging an also-naked woman \u2026 because he's so chivalrous. \"He hugged her to cover her up. He went over to be the gentleman and said, 'I\u2019ll shield you. I\u2019ll protect you. I won\u2019t let them see you,'\" says a witness, adding, \"She seemed to like that very much.\" We bet. Not surprisingly, Playgirl has now come a-knocking. The magazine wants Harry to pose for a centerfold, and though the publisher acknowledges that there's no way the prince would agree, he tells E!, \"I think a million dollars is not out of the question.\" Harry might need to learn a little something about people with cameras \u2026 and Facebook. Before his trip to Vegas, the prince went to a private island for yet more partying, and pictures of the alcohol-fueled weekend were posted on the Facebook page of one of Harry's friends. Unfortunately, that Facebook page was not private\u2014leading the Telegraph to publish the pictures, including one that appears to show Harry passed out in the sand. And there may be more pictures coming. A PR guru tells the AP two women, who claim to have been inside Harry's hotel room, approached him to sell more pictures and video of the prince. Though the PR guy didn't bite, he bets someone else will.",

When cats started becoming friendly towards us, maybe 5,000 to 10,000 years ago, they just adapted this piece of behavior to show that they like us, too,\" he continued. \n \n Author of the 2013 book Cat Sense: How the New Feline Science Can Make You a Better Friend to Your Pet (which has been attracting a resurgence of interest on social media this week), Bradshaw has been studying the history and behavior of cats for decades. He argues that to live happily with our cats, we must first come to understand their behavior and their eccentricities. \n \n For instance, knowing that cats carry out this tail-up/rub ritual as a form of friendly greeting should influence the way cat owners interact with their pets, Bradshaw says. \n \n \"Research has shown that when people interact with their cats, the interactions tend to go on for longer if they're started by the cat -- many cats seem to need to go through the tail-up/rub ritual in order to feel comfortable, and may not have time to do it if it's the person who makes the first move. So the advice would be, take your time when approaching your cat, and wait for it to at least put its tail up before making actual contact,\" he told HuffPost. \n \n Bradshaw has also advised cat lovers to keep their ears peeled for purring. Purring, he says, isn't just a way that cats express contentment, but -- as he explained to NPR's Terry Gross last year -- it can also be a sort of signal for help. \n \n \"What we think cats are doing here is just trying to reassure their person \u2014 or [another] cat \u2014 who is hearing the purr that they are no threat, and ideally they'd like them to stand still and help them do something,\" Bradshaw told Gross. \"So it starts off with kittens purring to get their mother to lie still while they're suckling, and it goes on into adulthood... It's a signal to the animals, [and] the people around them to pay attention and try to help them.\" \n \n As for whether or not your cat likes you, Bradshaw says there are a handful of tell-tale signs of a cat's affection. \n \n \"Cats show they're fond of other cats in three ways,\" he told HuffPost. \"The tail-up/rub ritual; by resting in contact; and by grooming one another. So if your cat is doing any one of these, then it likes you! It doesn't have to be all three -- for example, some cats (in my experience, especially the long-haired) don't much like sitting on people's laps, but if they're reliably doing the tail-up/rub, then everything's okay.\" \n \n To find out more about John Bradshaw's book, visit the publication's website.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Cats aren't dogs, and they'd like us to remember that, an animal behavior expert tells the Telegraph. We stress them out by expecting them to be as sociable as our canine friends, happy to be petted and hang out in the same space as other cats. But that just doesn't fit with how cats think, says Dr. John Bradshaw. \"Dogs were sociable before they were domesticated,\" he says. \"Unlike dogs, the cat is still halfway between a domestic and a wild animal, and it\u2019s not enjoying 21st-century living.\" And when a cat is stressed, it can develop dermatitis and cystitis, he notes. In the past, \"with cats, all we wanted was for them to keep our houses and farms and food stores free of rats and mice, and they got on with that,\" Bradshaw says. \u201cIt\u2019s only in the last few decades that we have wanted them to be something else.\" That's not to say your cat doesn't love you, he adds. It's just that they \"have their own lives\" and interests. (And, as he told the Huffington Post earlier this year, your cat probably also thinks you are a very large cat; that's why, he theorizes, they communicate affection with humans the same way they do with other cats.) Some tips: Cats are likely to spend more time with you if they approach you, rather than if you approach them first, according to research, he notes. And if you're planning to get a second cat, you might want to bring its smell home first on a handkerchief: \"It\u2019s the cat equivalent of exchanging photos before a blind date.\" (Read about a cat who lived secret lives with two families.)",

Locals shifted the bodies to the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital Tangi for autopsy. However, they staged a protest demonstration when male doctors conducted the postmortem of the female victims due to shortage of female staff at the hospital. \n \n Police sources said the accused had killed his parents and two brothers for delaying his marriage with Naveeda six months ago. \n \n Hazrat Nawab, brother of Hazrat Jamal, in the first information report (FIR) at the Mandi Police Station, said his brother had refused to make marriage of his daughter with the accused that enraged the accused and he killed the entire family.

It was something that I just couldn't fathom.\" \n \n The chief's arrest was another setback for a troubled agency rocked by allegations of racial profiling. \n \n Before joining Miami Gardens last year, Johnson served as the police chief in North Miami, later stepping into the role of city manager. \n \n Johnson took the helm shortly after the owner of 207 Quickstop convenience store filed a lawsuit claiming Miami Gardens officers habitually harassed his minority employees and customers. An investigation by The Miami Herald found that one employee had been stopped 419 times in five years. \n \n \"We were in a bit of turmoil at the time [he was hired],\" Benson said. \"I was bringing in someone who was experienced, who had served as chief and who could come in and mend relationships with the community. He was the person I believed who could do that job and accept the challenge.\" \n \n Johnson's arrest was just another unexpected crisis from which Miami Gardens will recover, Benson said. \n \n \"The way I look at it, it's another obstacle for us to overcome,\" Benson said. \"This city is going to continue to move forward. And we have collectively taken a stance that no matter what, we are going to do everything to improve the city and ensure our residents are living in a safe environment and living in a city that is respectful. This is not going to stop us from doing that.\" \n \n Assistant Chief Antonio Brooklen has been named the interim police chief. On Saturday, Benson said he was not yet sure whether he would promote from within or look outside the organization for a new chief. \n \n At Johnson's condo Saturday, a valet driver wondered if the chief had made a date with a cop posing as a prostitute. \n \n When the valet learned the chief was snared in an undercover sting, he shook his head. \n \n \"Oh, wow!\" he said. \"That's some bad luck.\" \n \n epesantes@tribpub.com or 954-356-4543 \n \n sbryan@sunsentinel.com or 954-356-4554 ||||| Stephen Johnson arrived in Miami Gardens almost a year ago with a mission: to repair a frayed relationship between the police department and the community. \n \n On Friday night, he lost his job after being arrested and charged with soliciting a prostitute at a Dania Beach hotel as part of a sting operation by the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office. \n \n On Saturday morning, when Johnson bonded out of the Broward County Jail, a gaggle of TV cameras greeted him. He then apologized for the arrest and pointed to stress on the job for his poor judgment. \n \n \u201cI want to apologize to the community, and I want to apologize to my elected officials,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThe stress overwhelmed me, and I made a very bad decision to deal with that moment I\u2019ve never experienced before.\u201d \n \n Never miss a local story.

Johnson, however, did not elaborate further about how the incident and his arrest were connected, but he said it was a stressful situation. \n \n Johnson\u2019s arrest has again thrust the police department into a negative spotlight. It comes just days after protesters marched into City Hall to express their anger over the fatal police shooting of a mentally ill man fewer than two weeks ago. \n \n On Saturday, Miami Gardens Mayor Oliver Gilbert told the Miami Herald that the city and police department will move on from this incident. \n \n \u201cMr. Johnson\u2019s actions were unacceptable and I support the city manager\u2019s decision to end his tenure as chief of police immediately,\u201d he said. \u201cThe city police department is more than one man. It is hundreds of dedicated men and women that rise to serve the wonderful residents of the city. Their duty is unchanged and their service will not be interrupted. We will move forward as a police department, city, and community, together.\u201d \n \n The Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office gave this account of Johnson\u2019s arrest: \n \n On Friday, Johnson used his cellphone to call a number he\u2019d found on the escort section of backpage.com and spoke to a woman he believed to be a prostitute. They discussed him paying $80 for 30 minutes with one woman, later settling on $100 for a threesome. \n \n At about 6:20 p.m. Friday, Johnson arrived at an unidentified hotel in Dania Beach with two condoms in his back pocket. He knocked on the door of room 423, where he was greeted by the presumed prostitutes. As soon as he paid the $100, he was arrested. \n \n Detectives captured the encounter with Johnson on video and audio. \n \n Within an hour of the arrest, City Manager Cameron Benson fired Johnson and named Assistant Police Chief Antonio Brooklen interim chief. Then the city released this statement: \n \n \u201cWe remain committed to excellence and integrity on every level. We will not allow Mr. Johnson\u2019s bad judgment to reflect negatively on the hardworking officers of the city of Miami Gardens and the residents they serve on a daily basis.\u201d \n \n The expectations had been high for Johnson, a veteran cop. He\u2019d come with 30 years of experience working in the public sector. Rising from a rookie cop to police chief in North Miami during the first 27 years, he then transitioned to the city\u2019s administration when he was appointed interim city manager in August 2011. Within three months, he was given the permanent job. \n \n By spring 2014, city administrators in Miami Gardens were looking for a new top cop after losing former chief Matthew Boyd \u2014 the young city\u2019s first and only police chief at the time \u2014 and his deputy chief Paul Miller when they resigned amid allegations of harassment and illegal stop-and-frisk tactics at the 207 Quikstop. The scandal, brought to light after the Miami Herald obtained surveillance videos from the convenience store owners showing cops\u2019 behavior, left a blemish on the department\u2019s reputation. \n \n In April 2014, Johnson donned the four gold stars on his collar for Miami Gardens as he set out to improve the reputation of the police department. \n \n He did make some strides in gaining favor with the community. At his first appearance before the City Council last year, he gave the public his cell phone number to make himself accessible. He was more present at community events and crime watch meetings. \n \n Before he was hired in Miami Gardens, Johnson did face some controversy when he was police chief in North Miami. He was criticized for buying 43 replica police badges for former North Miami Mayor Andre Pierre without consulting the city manager. According to evaluations from his time on the North Miami force, he was noted for submitting police reports late and writing correspondence with grammatical errors. \n \n He\u2019d recently been dealing with the shooting death of a mentally ill man, Lavall Hall. He had been shot by police officer Eddo Trimino. Trimino and his partner claim Hall was shot after he struck the officers with a broomstick. Johnson supported his officers, tell the press they \u201cdid the best they could.\u201d \n \n Johnson is also listed as a pastor at Bethel House of God Church in Hallandale Beach, according to the congregation\u2019s website.

    "document": "Red Riding Hood (2011) \n \n The bluenose brigade at the Motion Picture Association of America has stamped \u201c Red Riding Hood \u201d with a PG-13 rating for \u201cviolence and creature terror, and some sensuality.\u201d Certainly this goofily amusing screen fairy tale includes bloodshed, but it\u2019s generally tamer than its often-gruesome source. The creature terror meanwhile isn\u2019t remotely frightening, though the designated mustache twirler (and scene chewer) Gary Oldman tries to rustle up scares. As to sensuality, Amanda Seyfried as You-Know-Who makes a delectable treat whether heaving her bosom or boogieing down in a bacchanal that\u2019s more Burning Man than Bruegel . \n \n At this point in her short movie career Ms. Seyfried hasn\u2019t often been asked to do more than hit her marks and deliver her lines, which she does appealingly in \u201cRed Riding Hood.\u201d What she mostly brings to her movies is otherworldly, unthreatening beauty \u2014 she has the saucer eyes and heart-shaped face of an anime pixie \u2014 and that elusive gift of cinematic presence. When she\u2019s on camera, she draws all eyes to her, something that the director here, Catherine Hardwicke, grasps. Ms. Hardwicke is an uneven, at times careless filmmaker, but as she showed in movies like \u201cThirteen\u201d and the first \u201cTwilight,\u201d she is attuned to beauty and has a way with young actors, tapping their energy so it buzzes on screen. \n \n From the start Ms. Hardwicke tries to make the case that this isn\u2019t your granny\u2019s favorite fairy tale. The story opens with its heroine, Valerie, as a child (Megan Charpentier), strolling about in trousers (the other girls are in dresses) while in voice-over Ms. Seyfried insists that she tried to be a good girl. But goodness had nothing to do with it, as Mae West once quipped, or so Ms. Hardwicke seems to want us to believe. Before long Valerie has run off with a boy pointedly named Peter (first D J Greenburg, later Shiloh Fernandez with hair gel), and they\u2019re frolicking in the forest and snaring a rabbit. Valerie urges Peter to slay the animal, but he can\u2019t or won\u2019t, and the sequence ends with her holding a knife to the bunny like a natural-born killer. \n \n The suggestion that Red Riding Hood might be as much predator as prey isn\u2019t new. She may be the intended victim, but she\u2019s also the one who (after sizing up the wolf in bed) ends triumphant. It\u2019s this blurring between the antagonists as well as the flexibility of the story\u2019s morals and meanings that make it work well for different readers and writers. In the 17th century Charles Perrault turned an oral folk tale into \u201cLe Petit Chaperon Rouge,\u201d and three centuries later Angela Carter gave the story a wicked, feminist spin. Ms. Hardwicke doesn\u2019t acknowledge \u201cThe Company of Wolves,\u201d Carter\u2019s brilliant retelling, but it\u2019s probable that she read it or saw Neil Jordan\u2019s dreary 1984 big-screen adaptation. \n \n But, my, what sharp teeth Ms. Hardwicke doesn\u2019t have: working from David Leslie Johnson\u2019s screenplay she takes on the story\u2019s grown-up themes of sex and death directly but weakly. This might be because the movie has been pitched at young adults, as evidenced by its pretty leads, electronic soundtrack, contemporary vibe and veneer, and caution. Some of the updating works \u2014 a proto-hippie witchy woman, the grandmother (Julie Christie) now rocks the screen in dreadlocks \u2014 but at other times the modern touches feel like sloppiness or even pandering. It\u2019s hard to know, for instance, if Ms. Hardwicke, a former production designer, didn\u2019t notice that the clothing looks straight from the costume department, or whether she (or her producers) didn\u2019t want to turn off their presumptive audience with anything, you know, old. \n \n The introduction of a religious zealot, Father Solomon (Mr. Oldman), adds some busywork drama and action. Summoned to vanquish the computer-generated wolf (an underfed brother to the ludicrous lupine beasts in the \u201cTwilight\u201d franchise), the padre arrives with an armed multicultural entourage and, in a flamboyant touch, a torture chamber cum Easy-Bake Oven shaped like an elephant. (Unlucky prisoners are slow-roasted inside.) At one point Valerie worries with good reason that Father Solomon might mistake her for a witch. But this nod at historic female troubles doesn\u2019t go anywhere, largely because Valerie spends so much time negotiating between dueling loves, Peter and a wealthier suitor, Henry (Max Irons), while juggling her mother, Suzette (Virginia Madsen, rouged and Maybellined), and father, Cesaire (Billy Burke). \n \n When the wolf in one of Carter\u2019s Red Riding Hood stories explains to the girl why he has big teeth \u2014 \u201cAll the better to eat you with\u201d \u2014 she bursts out laughing. \u201cShe knew,\u201d Carter writes, \u201cshe was nobody\u2019s meat.\u201d Her insouciance is thrilling. Ms. Hardwicke wants to have her feminism and fairy tale, but Carter\u2019s no-prisoners bad attitude is too far out for an entertainment like \u201cRed Riding Hood,\u201d where only the appearance of girl power will finally do. Given this, it\u2019s worth noting that Ms. Hardwicke, who is deeply enamored of aerial photography, sends the camera repeatedly soaring over the landscape where sometimes a woman in a red cloak as vivid as blood walks with a man across the snowy expanse. It\u2019s a striking image suggestive of freedom, though perhaps it\u2019s really just the guy who this little fairy-tale fugitive needs to escape from. \n \n \u201cRed Riding Hood\u201d is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Wolf violence and make-out sessions. \n \n RED RIDING HOOD \n \n Opens on Friday nationwide. \n \n Directed by Catherine Hardwicke; written by David Leslie Johnson; director of photography, Mandy Walker; edited by Nancy Richardson; music by Brian Reitzell and Alex Heffes; production design by Tom Sanders; costumes by Cindy Evans; produced by Jennifer Davisson Killoran, Leonardo DiCaprio and Julie Yorn; released by Warner Brothers Pictures.

Printer-friendly \u00bb \n \n E-mail this to a friend \u00bb Of the classics of world literature crying out to be filmed as a sexual fantasy for teenage girls, surely \"Red Riding Hood\" is far down on the list. Here's a movie that cross-pollinates the \"Twilight\" formula with a werewolf and adds a girl who always wears a red hooded cape, although I don't recall her doing any riding. It's easy to imagine a story conference in which they said: Hey! Let's switch the vampires with a werewolf and recycle the theme of a virgin attracted to a handsome but dangerous hunk, only let's get two hunks! What this inspiration fails to account for is that while a young woman might toy with the notion of a vampire boyfriend, she might not want to mate with a wolf. Although she might think it was, like, cool to live in the woods in Oregon, she might not want to live in the Black Forest hundreds of years ago because, like, can you text from there? \n \n \n \n \"Red Riding Hood\" has the added inconvenience of being dreadfully serious about a plot so preposterous, it demands to be filmed by Monty Python. All that amused me was a dream sequence where Grandma says, \u201cThe better to eat you with.\u201d I'm asking myself, \u201cHow can Red Riding Hood dream about dialogue in her own fairy tale when she hasn't even gone over the hill and through the dale to grandmother's house yet?\u201d \n \n \n \n The movie was directed by Catherine Hardwicke, who made the first \"Twilight\" film. \"Red Riding Hood\" opens with computer-generated shots of hundreds of square miles of forests, dotted here and there by grim, stubby castles. Then we meet the narrator, Valerie, who always wears a red cape. She is but a lass when she steals away with Peter, her pre-pubescent boyfriend, so they can trap a bunny rabbit and possibly slit its throat, although the camera moves away from the bunny at the crucial moment to focus upon their faces as the young actors think, \u201cOK, this is where they flash forward, and we are replaced by Amanda Seyfried and Shiloh Fernandez.\u201d \n \n \n \n They live in a village that is one of the oddest non-places in the history of production design. Because the original fairy tale was by the Brothers Grimm, I suppose there's a chance the village is in Germany, but it exists outside time and space, and seems to have been inspired by little plastic souvenir villages in airport gift shops. You know, populated mit Hansel und Gretel. \n \n \n \n Valerie (Seyfried) wants to marry Peter (Fernandez), who is a wood chopper, but her parents have betrothed her to a rich kid named Henry (Max Irons). The village since time immemorial has been terrorized by a werewolf, who turns up when the moon is full and must be pacified by a pathetic little piggie left chained to a stump, lest it develop an appetite for villagers. Valerie's sister is found dead, amidst distracting cone-shaped haystacks dotted with purple flowers, which is not the sort of detail you want to be noticing when a young girl has been killed (spoiler!) not eaten by a werewolf. \n \n \n \n The villagers send off for Father Solomon (Gary Oldman), a famed werewolf fighter, and he arrives with his band of warriors and a very large metal elephant. Solomon, an expert, knows that werewolves are not werewolves all the time, and in between full moons take the form of men. Therefore, one of the villagers must be a werewolf. This has enormous implications for Valerie's possible future love life. \n \n \n \n But I know my readers. Right now, you aren't thinking about Valerie's romance. You're thinking, Did I just read that Father Solomon arrived with a very large metal elephant? Yes, he did. A very large metal elephant. I thought the same thing. That must have been a hell of a lot of trouble. Even harder than Herzog dragging the boat over the mountain. Showing Father Solomon's men dragging a metal elephant through the woods \u2014 there's your movie right there. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

It\u2019s No. 3 and in the midst of a three-year slide. During the first three months of this year, the NBC program finished behind perennial rivals \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on CBS and \u201cThis Week With George Stephanopoulos\u201d on ABC, despite being helped by two weeks of Winter Olympics hoopla.

(Schieffer\u2019s competitors are quick to point out that comparisons aren\u2019t quite fair since \u201cFTN\u2019s\u201d ratings are based on its first half-hour, not the standard full hour; the program\u2019s second half-hour isn\u2019t broadcast by CBS stations in many cities). \n \n The Sunday shows \u2014 which comprise what Schieffer calls \u201cthe smartest morning on TV\u201d \u2014 are more than just prestige projects for the networks; the relatively large and affluent audiences they attract make them magnets for corporate image advertisers that pay premium prices for airtime. Russert\u2019s dominating position helped NBC earn a reported $60 million from \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in 2007. \n \n Thus, \u201cMTP\u2019s\u201d meltdown has sounded alarm bells inside NBC News and attracted the attention of its new president, Deborah Turness, who arrived from Britain\u2019s ITV News in August. Gregory\u2019s job does not appear to be in any immediate jeopardy, but there are plenty of signs of concern. \n \n Last year, the network undertook an unusual assessment of the 43-year-old journalist, commissioning a psychological consultant to interview his friends and even his wife. The idea, according to a network spokeswoman, Meghan Pianta, was \u201cto get perspective and insight from people who know him best.\u201d But the research project struck some at NBC as odd, given that Gregory has been employed there for nearly 20 years. \n \n Around the same time, the network appointed a new executive producer at \u201cMTP,\u201d Rob Yarin, a veteran media consultant. Yarin, who had worked with Gregory on an MSNBC show, \u201cRace for the White House,\u201d during the 2008 campaign, succeeded Betsy Fischer Martin, who reigned over \u201cMTP\u201d for 11 years. Fischer Martin had helped Russert soar to glory, but had disagreed with Gregory over matters of style and substance (she was promoted to oversee all of NBC\u2019s political coverage). \n \n In interviews, Yarin and Gregory say they are tinkering with the show to keep it abreast of a changing media environment. They\u2019ve made the program\u2019s pacing faster, with shorter interview segments. The range of topics and interview subjects has been opened up, too. Last month, for example, Gregory interviewed NCAA President Mark Emmert about proposals to unionize student-athletes \u2014 stealing a little thunder, he notes, from CBS, which was televising the NCAA basketball tournament at the time. \n \n The overall effect is that the program now bears only a vague resemblance to the one over which Russert presided. Whereas Russert would spend multiple segments grilling a single newsmaker, Gregory now barely goes more than six or seven minutes on any interview or topic. \n \n The changes were readily apparent on Sunday\u2019s program, recorded at NBC\u2019s studios in Northwest Washington. After opening with Gregory\u2019s taped interview with Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, the host moved swiftly to live dual-screen chats with Senate Foreign Relations Committee members Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). Then it was on to the journalists\u2019 roundtable discussion, followed by an interview with Democratic National Committee chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) about health care and the midterm elections. \n \n Then, still more segments: A new recorded feature called \u201cMeeting America\u201d in which reporter Kevin Tibbles looks at something happening outside Washington (in this case, a debate in Kentucky over the building of a Biblical theme park using tax subsidies); more roundtable discussion; and a photos-of-the-week feature called \u201cImages to Remember.\u201d The program closed with a short interview with New York Times reporter Jo Becker about her new book about gay marriage, \u201cForcing the Spring.\u201d \n \n Gregory says the new look \u201cdelivers on the core of what \u2018Meet the Press\u2019 is\u201d but \u201cwidens the aperture . . . I\u2019m dedicated to building something that says we\u2019re not just thinking about politics. We\u2019re thinking about who the real influencers are in this country.\u201d \n \n \u201cThis Week,\u201d which is anchored irregularly by Stephanopoulos (he also hosts the daily \u201cGood Morning America\u201d), says it\u2019s shaking things up, too. \n \n The ABC program has a new executive producer, Jonathan Greenberger, a 30-year-old Stephanopoulos protege. Greenberger started at ABC News out of college at 22, and climbed so fast that the network waited for him to finish Stanford Law School before handing him the executive producer job at \u201cThis Week\u201d last year. \n \n Greenberger describes a program that is more ensemble in nature and more of a magazine than a traditional newsmaker-interview show. On a recent program, Stephanopoulos chatted with an ABC reporter in Ukraine about the latest news, then segued to a discussion with correspondent (and sometime fill-in host) Martha Raddatz about the unfolding diplomacy, followed by an interview with Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. \n \n \u201cA few years ago, we wouldn\u2019t have moved so fast to integrate all of those elements into the program,\u201d says Greenberger. \u201cWe\u2019d have the vice chairman and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee on to have a debate.\u201d \n \n Like \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d \u201cThis Week\u201d has to be wary of changing too much. The ABC program is still recovering from its attempt to build itself around former CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour, whose strength is foreign affairs, not domestic politics. Amanpour lasted about 18 months as host before going back to CNN in 2011. \n \n Schieffer, meanwhile, says \u201cFace the Nation\u201d isn\u2019t planning to change. \u201cThere\u2019s no bells and whistles here,\u201d says the host, who\u2019s been \u201cFace\u2019s\u201d face since 1991. \u201cWe just try to move the stories of the week forward.\u201d \n \n The good news for all three shows is that they remain among the most durable on TV, if perhaps less influential than they once were. Even as everything else on TV has lost viewers over time, the Big Three have held steady and even gained viewers. Collectively, about 9.6 million people watched them each week during the first three months of this year, about the same number that watched Russert in 2005. This doesn\u2019t count the audience for innumerable Sunday-morning competitors, from Fox News Sunday (hosted by former \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Chris Wallace) to \u201cAl Punto\u201d on Univision. \n \n The shows can occasionally make news, too, if the interview subject is big enough. Conservatives are still raising questions about then-United Nations ambassador Susan Rice\u2019s comments on the Sunday shows in 2012 about the attack on a U.S. facility in Benghazi, Libya that left four Americans dead. Gregory, meanwhile, mentions his \u201cMeet the Press\u201d interview with Vice President Biden in 2012, in which Biden expressed support for same-sex marriage, prompting President Obama to become the first sitting president to declare his support a few days later (in an interview with ABC). \n \n Gregory himself has sparked controversy for what he\u2019s said and done on the air. Conservatives called for the moderator\u2019s prosecution after he held up a high-capacity ammunition magazine in an interview with National Rifle Association chief executive Wayne LaPierre in late 2012 (possession of such armaments is illegal in the District; Gregory wasn\u2019t charged). Last June, the Twittersphere exploded with outrage when Gregory asked journalist Glenn Greenwald about having \u201caided and abetted\u201d NSA secrets leaker Edward Snowden, insinuating that Greenwald was complicit in espionage. \n \n The impossible burden for Gregory, of course, has been to follow the beloved Russert. As one NBC colleague describes it, Russert is a \u201cghost\u201d who still haunts Gregory\u2019s tenure at \u201cMTP\u201d six years into his run. \n \n \u201cI am fully aware that there are a lot of people who believe Tim Russert will never be replaced, and I\u2019ve never tried to replace Tim Russert,\" he says. \u201cI have nothing but respect and admiration for Tim and his legacy. And I\u2019m doing my own thing, just like Tim did.\u201d \n \n But he also adds, a little more defensively, \u201cI\u2019ve covered the White House, I\u2019ve covered 9/11, the road to war, constitutional crises, and honestly, I wouldn\u2019t be able to focus on this job if I was going to let that stuff get to me. I knew it would be there going in and I\u2019m just focused on being David Gregory and taking the show to the next level.\u201d \n \n Some Gregory supporters think he has the best hand to play over the long haul. Stephanopoulos has already pulled back from moderating \u201cThis Week\u201d and may be in line to succeed 68-year-old Diane Sawyer as the anchor of \u201cABC World News Tonight\u201d some day. Although Schieffer says he hasn\u2019t set his retirement date, it may be not be very far way \u2014 \u201canother year or so,\u201d as he put it. \n \n Which means both CBS and ABC would have to retool their Sunday-morning shows with new moderators. \n \n \u201cTime is on David\u2019s side,\u201d says Bloomberg View columnist Jeffrey Goldberg, a semi-regular \u201cMTP\u201d panelist. \u201cIt\u2019s semi-inevitable. He just has to keep doing what he\u2019s doing, and continue to break new ground on the big stories of the week. In five to 10 years, we\u2019ll be talking about him as the grand old man of Sunday morning.\u201d ||||| NBC News last year hired a \"psychological consultant\" to interview David Gregory's friends and family, part of an effort to get greater insight into the \"Meet the Press\" host's personality, according to a new report. \n \n The point of hiring the consultant, NBC spokeswoman Meghan Pianta said, was to \"to get perspective and insight from people who know him best.\" \n \n That nugget is part of a new report from The Washington Post's Paul Farhi looking at the problems that have bedeviled \"Meet the Press\" in recent years.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A long Washington Post article on David Gregory and the troubles he faces as moderator of NBC's Meet the Press has quite a few people wondering what's going on at the show. As the Post explains, the longest-running television program has been declining in the ratings for three years, and is currently the No. 3 Sunday talk show. Last year, the network brought in a psychological consultant to talk to friends and family members of Gregory, who took over the gig after Tim Russert's death in 2008. As the Post puts it, that seems \"odd\" to some, considering Gregory has been at NBC almost two decades. Multiple blogs picked up on that tidbit, and NBC quickly gave Poynter a statement insisting it actually hired \"a brand consultant,\" not a psychological one, \"to better understand how its anchor connects.\" The network also says the move is \"not unusual.\" But the article's writer tells Politico he checked the term \"psychological\" with the network twice, and it had \"no objections then\"\u2014and it remains in the Post story as of this writing.

    "document": "An Australian ship scouring the Indian Ocean for missing flight MH370 has detected two further pings consistent with the plane's two black boxes, in a \"great lead\", bolstering hopes for wreckage discovery. \n \n The Australian Defence Vessel Ocean Shield, towing a US pinger locator, detected two sets of pings, on Tuesday afternoon and then again about five hours later. \n \n The signal detected on Tuesday afternoon was held for about five minutes and 32 seconds; followed by a second signal on Tuesday night, which was held for seven minutes. \n \n The Australian vessel Ocean Shield is towing a pinger locator in the search for MH370. Photo: AP \n \n The development came more than two days after Ocean Shield first detected the month-long search's most promising lead: two acoustic events on Saturday. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Retired air chief marshal Angus Houston, the head of the search's Joint Agency Co-ordination centre, announced the \"promising\" development during a press conference in Perth on Wednesday afternoon. \n \n It revives hope the missing Malaysia Airlines plane's black box is still transmitting data days after its batteries were due to run dead. \n \n Crew on the Ocean Shield deploy the towed pinger locator. Photo: AP \n \n Mr Houston said expert data analysis on previously detected signals had found they were not of natural origin, further boosting hopes of a breakthrough. \n \n Mr Houston said experts believed the signals were consistent with those of a flight data recorder. \n \n He said the first two pings - detected on April 5 at 4.45pm and at 9.27pm Perth time - had been analysed by the Australasian Joint Acoustic Analysis Centre, based at HMAS Albatross in Nowra, on the NSW south coast. \n \n \"The analysis determined that a very stable, distinct and clear signal was detected at 33.331 kilohertz, and that it consistently pulsed at a 1.106-second interval,\" Mr Houston said. \n \n ''They therefore asses that the transmission was not of natural origin, and was likely sourced from specific electronic equipment. They believe the signals to be consistent with the specification and description of a flight data recorder.'' \n \n He said two latest pings were detected on Tuesday - at 4.27pm and 10.17pm, Perth time. \n \n Mr Houston said up to 11 military aircraft, four civil aircraft and up to 14 ships would assist in Wednesday's search, while the Ocean Shield would also conduct a sonar voice search. \n \n The search area has been refined to a single zone, about 75,423 square kilometres in size, 2261 kilometres north west of Perth, which was a considerably smaller area than in previous days, he said. \n \n ''Based on Ocean Shield's detections, we are now searching a much more concentrated area, based on the drift predications made possible by Ocean Shield's detections,'' Mr Houston said. \n \n ''The smaller area has also allowed us to plan much tighter search patterns based entirely on visual search principles. In other words, we have intensified our search in the visual search area. \n \n \"There's no second chances,\" he said. \n \n \"It looks like the signals we picked up recently have been much weaker than the original signals we picked up ... we're either a long away from it or in my view more likely the batteries are starting to fade.\" \n \n Although authorities have previously said the autonomous underwater vehicle Bluefin-21 would be dropped to the ocean floor once they received a third ping, they have yet to deploy the asset. \n \n \"By triangulating this data we will be able to come up with a much smaller search area under water,\" Mr Houston said. \n \n \"Time spent on the surface, we're covering six times more area than we would be able to do when we get under water. With the batteries due to fail shortly, we need to get as much positional data as we can.\" \n \n An RAAF aircraft has been diverted to Ocean Shield to drop buoys around the field to lay a \"sonar buoy pattern\", which will involve underwater and floating components transmitting data back to the aircraft. \n \n \"That will provide a range of sensors, 1000 feet down, which is 1000 feet closer to the pinger locator on the ocean floor,\" Commodore Leavy, the operational head of the Australian search, said. \n \n The Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 vanished without a trace during en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur on March 8. \n \n Despite an extensive and costly international search operation off the West Australian coast, the effort has failed to turn up a single piece of evidence to confirm the plane's final resting place. \n \n \n \n ||||| Story highlights U.S. official: \"We need to maintain respectful optimism and be responsible\" \n \n Expert says refined search area manageable for underwater vessels \n \n Possible discovery of plane's pingers energizes search, but for how much longer? \n \n Agency: Up to 15 planes, 14 ships could take part in Wednesday's search \n \n In a sea of uncertainty, two bits of good news emerged Wednesday. \n \n The Australian ship Ocean Shield picked up fresh signals that officials hope are locator beacons from the data recorders of the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. \n \n The ship had first picked up the underwater pulses Saturday. But then, for the next three days, nothing. \n \n On Tuesday, the ship once again reacquired the signals. That's four signals in the same broad area: two on Saturday; two on Tuesday. \n \n Just Watched Search area narrows despite no new pings replay More Videos ...

Hiding in another plane's shadow? 03:57 PLAY VIDEO \n \n \"I believe we are searching in the right area but we need to visually identify wreckage before we can confirm with certainty that this is the final resting place of MH370,\" Houston said. \n \n The second piece of good news? Authorities analyzed the signals picked up Saturday and determined they were not of \n \n natural origin and was likely sourced from specific electronic equipment. \n \n \"They believe the signals to be consistent with the specification and description of a flight data recorder,\" Houston said. \n \n Signals getting weaker \n \n Wednesday is Day 33 in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which went missing March 8. It was carrying 239 people. \n \n Authorities haven't given up trying. Instead, they are pinning their hopes on the so-pings. \n \n But time is not on their side. \n \n The batteries powering the flight recorders' locator beacons are certified to be working for 30 days. Stored in a plane's tail, they are designed to begin sending off distinct, high-pitched signals as soon as they come in contact with water. \n \n \"The signals are getting weaker. Which means we're either moving away from the search area or the pinger batteries are dying,\" Houston said. \n \n The first signal, at 4:45 p.m. Perth Time on Saturday, lasted 2 hours 20 minutes. \n \n The second, at 9:27 p.m. Saturday, lasted 13 minutes. \n \n The third signal was picked up Tuesday at 4:27 p.m. That lasted 5 minutes 32 seconds. \n \n The fourth, at 10:17 p.m. Tuesday, was 7 minutes long. \n \n \"It's certainly encouraging that more signals have been detected,\" Pentagon spokesman Adm. John Kirby told CNN. \n \n \"There is still much work to do, however.\" \n \n Four reasons to believe; six reasons to doubt \n \n Discovery of possible 'locator beacon' pulses gives hope \n \n Wednesday's search includes up to 11 military planes, four civilian aircraft as well as 14 ships -- three of which, Australia's Ocean Shield further north and the British HMS Echo and Chinese Haixun 01 to the south -- will be focusing underwater. \n \n All told, everyone involved will be scouring a 29,000-square-mile zone centered about 1,400 miles northwest of Perth, according to Australia's Joint Agency Coordination Centre. That's large and challenging, but still pales in comparison to the once nearly 3 million miles, at sea and on land, the searchers were scouring for signs of the lost aircraft a few weeks ago. \n \n Kevin McEvoy, a New Zealand air force commodore involved in the effort, noted that authorities once \"didn't even know which haystack\" to look in for the aircraft. \n \n \"I think we have got a much clearer picture around the areas that we need to concentrate on,\" McEvoy told CNN's Erin Burnett from Auckland. \n \n Authorities greatly shrank that area after analyzing satellite data to determine Flight 370 had set off from Kuala Lumpur toward Beijing, turned around to go back over the Malay Peninsula, then ended up in the southern Indian Ocean. \n \n Why? No one really knows. \n \n The best chance to answer that question may rest wherever the plane -- and its so-called black boxes, with their trove of information about the plane and its movements -- now resides. \n \n Search planes dispatched day after day looking for evidence of the missing airliner -- a floating wing, a seat cushion, anything -- thus far have come up empty. \n \n The latest, greatest hopes have come from crews listening underwater for signs of Flight 370. \n \n The first such possible breakthrough came last Friday and Saturday, when a Chinese ship detected pulses that may have been from the plane. No more have been heard since. \n \n According to McEvoy, \"the main focus\" centers around the site of Saturday's discovery from Australia's Ocean Shield. It used more advanced detection gear than that aboard the Chinese vessel and was found some 375 miles away, leading Houston to believe they are separate signals. \n \n The first signal, detected by a towed pinger locator, persisted for more than two hours; a second went on for about 13 minutes. \n \n Tuesday afternoon, it lasted about 5 minutes and 32 seconds. Tuesday night, about seven minutes. \n \n Beyond the dwindling battery life, there's all the ocean to contend with: The Ocean Shield signals were in water about 2.6 miles deep, meaning a number of things could literally get in the way of or otherwise disrupt the pulses. \n \n Searchers' intent not to roil the waters any further is why air and seaborne traffic in that find area is being limited, and why there is no rush to put in underwater drones to take photos. \n \n \"The better the Ocean Shield can define the area the easier it will be for the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle to subsequently search for aircraft wreckage,\" Houston said. \n \n Bear in mind with the Air France disaster, it took the underwater vehicle 20 days to get to the wreckage.\" \n \n What happens after the Malaysian plane's pingers die? \n \n And it's not as if, if more pulses are detected, they'll lead down in a straight line to the flight recorders. As is, the pings that were heard could have emanated from anywhere within a 5-mile radius, said Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation. \n \n Finding more signals could narrow the search area. Without them, authorities could then start the painstaking process of using side-scanning sonar to try to find the aircraft on the ocean's bottom. \n \n Meanwhile, the air search continues. As McEvoy explained, this area is \"slightly different\" than that being probed for pings because it is focused on surface debris, which would have shifted over the past few weeks -- thanks in part to a cyclone packing winds in excess of 160 mph that pushed through two weeks ago. \n \n So far, none of the aircraft that have been sent out has found anything. And even if it is narrowed, Wednesday's air search area is still roughly the size of South Carolina. \n \n As Wing Cmdr. Andy Scott of New Zealand stated: \"It's a large task that's still ahead of us.\" \n \n Next steps in underwater search \n \n Pings without wreckage 'befuddling' \n \n The absence of wreckage near these detected signals leaves some skeptical, worried that the Chinese and Australian ship's finds could be yet another false lead in an investigation that's been full of them. \n \n Acknowledging \"a very high-speed vertical impact\" could explain the lack of aircraft remnants, CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien said there's reason to be cautious. \n \n \"It's either the most extraordinary event, or those pings weren't real,\" O'Brien said. \"It's somewhat befuddling.\" \n \n Sarah Bajc, the partner of American passenger Philip Wood, isn't convinced about anything. She told CNN's Erin Burnett she thinks the plane was hijacked. Whether that proves true, one thing she won't believe are the Malaysian officials heading the investigation. \n \n \"All of us pretty well agree that until there's the bulk of the plane, the bulk of the bodies discovered, and a black box intact, we won't believe that it's final evidence,\" Bajc said early Wednesday from Beijing. \"... I don't think the authorities have given us much confidence of their investigative skills so far.\" \n \n The lack of clarity makes it hard to \"grieve properly and ... move on,\" -- something that she's not yet willing to do. \n \n \"I want to fight to find him, in whatever form that ends up being,\" said Bajc, who is coordinating with other passengers' kin to press for answers. \"And I think most of the families feel the same way.\" \n \n Until they get answers, women and men like Steve Wang -- whose mother was on the Malaysia Airlines plane -- are clinging to hope while trying to hold themselves together. \n \n \"We're just going through so many kinds of emotion,\" said Wang. \"... Desperate, sad and helpless -- something like that. Everything.\" \n \n Timeline: Leads in the hunt for Flight 370 weave drama \n \n Lucrative China-Malaysia relations not derailed by search for MH370 \n \n Wife of passenger: 'I needed to know they were looking for Pauly'",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Australian officials have sounded a fresh note of confidence in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, saying they've reacquired underwater signals following a lapse into silence. Search chief Angus Houston says an Australian navy vessel detected two sets of pings yesterday in the same area that signals were detected over the weekend, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. \"I'm now optimistic that we will find the aircraft, or what is left of the aircraft, in the not too distant future\u2014but we haven't found it yet, because this is a very challenging business,\" Houston told reporters.

    "document": "JOHN WAYNE: THE LAST COWBOY \n \n (Because of he recent heart surgery, John Wayne has been under doctor's orders not to do interviews for the next three months. He made an exception for Jim Bacon, his friend of 30 years. \"He knows I have enough on him to hang him\" jokes Bacon.) \n \n \"I guess I'm just too goddamned tough to die.\" That's the Duke talking - John Wayne. And he's right. There must be a few other 71-year olds around who have licked the Big C. But offhand I can't think of one who has licked the Big C and the Big H in 14 years. \n \n When the Duke had open-heart surgery this spring in Boston to replace a defective valve, surgeons were amazed at the durability of the screen's greatest legend. They should have known better. For the John Wayne you see on the screen is the same John Wayne you see in the flesh. There is only one, thank God. None of his friends could cope with more. \n \n Duke's last stay in the hospital scared his family and even scared him a little. Pilar, his estranged wife third wife, wanted a reconciliation, but as Duke say's, \"You can never go back\". \n \n The screen's most famous cowboy discovered the problem in his artery in a strange way. He had been having respiratory trouble ever since losing a lung to cancer in 1964. \"Then all of the sudden I found I was losing my voice,\" he explains. \"I didn't know until a doctor told me there is an artery that goes from your heart to your vocal cords. Now, that scared me. What the hell is an actor going to do when he loses his voice? That's how I make my living.\" \n \n As his fans know, nothing ever scared John Wayne. But this was different. \"I didn't fight anybody and say, 'Don't take me to the hospital,' but I was scared at losing my voice.\" he admits. (Duke not only talks for the camera, he speaks his mind loudly and clearly on many occasions, whether he has an audience or not). \n \n After his operation, I asked Duke if he could still take a belt of Scotch. \"I guess I could if I wanted to.\" he said, \"But I've been taking it easy since I came back from Boston. One of these days, I'll lift a few.\" \n \n When that happens, watch out. Duke can out drink anyone in Hollywood. Always could and always will. I remember the baptism of his son John Ethan at St. Cyril's Church in Encino, California, around 1 pm on a Sunday afternoon some 16 years ago. When I left Duke's Encino home after the baptism party, it was 8:00 am the next day - and the host was still singing with the mariachi band in his living room. Everybody, including half the musicians, had dropped by the way side, but Duke was still going until noontime at least. \n \n Incidents like these have helped make Wayne one of the most colorful movie legends since the heyday of silent stars Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford. Wayne's 150-odd movies, in a career spanning 50 years, have grossed a half-billion dollars or more. As a result, the people around him begin to panic when he gets sick. \n \n At the time of his cancer operation, the press releases from his producers said that John Wayne was in Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles for treatment of an old leg injury resulting from a fall on his yacht. I must confess, I believed it. Tough guys like Duke never get sick. They just get drunk and fall down. Unsuspecting, I dropped by the hospital one afternoon to visit, but was told by a nurse, \"Mr. Wayne is having no visitors.\" \"Let that son of a bitch come in,\" I heard that familiar voice bellow from his room. I had barely sat down next to his bed when he blurted out, \"Well, I licked the Big C.\" \n \n Then he went into detail about how his habitual six packs of cigarettes a day had resulted in a lung tumor the size of a baseball. Surgeons had no alternative but to remove the entire lung. Duke always had a cigarette cough, and one night, while he was recuperating, he started hacking so violently that his stitches burst. That alone might have killed him. But he snapped back. \n \n At the hospital, Duke apologized for the phony press releases. \"Those bastards who make pictures only think of the box office. They figure Duke Wayne with cancer isn't a good image. I was too doped up at the time to argue with them, but I'm telling you the truth now. You know I never lie.\" \n \n When my exclusive story broke around the world, public reaction was tremendous. Thousands of cancer victims and their relatives wrote to the actor. All the letters said the same thing - that Duke's fight against the dread disease had given them so much hope. \n \n Some 14 years later, when the star entered Massachusetts General Hospital, the same scenario was repeated. The original press stories said Duke had respiratory trouble, pneumonia, bronchitis - you name it. Then, at Duke's insistence, the public learned the truth: He had undergone open-heart surgery. These days, four assistants work around-the-clock to open more then 100,000 pieces of fan mail to Wayne, Many from victims of heart disease. They will be happy to know that Duke's voice is back to normal. The defective valve was replaced by one from a pig. \"Now not only can I talk,\" says Duke, \"but I go around saying 'oink, oink.'\" \n \n Duke has such a strong constitution that he's already back in excellent health, though on doctor's orders he is taking it easy for a few more weeks. Every morning he rises at around 6:30 and strolls for a mile or two around his Newport Beach, Calif. neighborhood, doing a mile in about in about 20 minutes. One recent weekend, he took his yacht - a converted mine-sweeper he calls \"The Wild Goose\" - on a trip across the channel to Catalina. He was at the helm during most of the trip and did some fishing too. \n \n Fishing has long been a hobby. Once he and his son Patrick caught what they later discovered was the biggest Mahi-Mahi (That's Hawaiian for Dolphin) on record. They weighed it, but it never made the record books. Duke, with his tremendous appetite, had eaten part of the fish by the time the boat docked. \"Hell, we knew it was big, but we didn't know it was the biggest,\" he shrugs. \"It tasted great.\" \n \n After his enforced convalescence is over, Duke plans to start working with scriptwriters on a new movie. It's the story of a contemporary family with Wayne as the patriarch. \"It could take place in the 30's or the 40's or now, but damn - it's funny.\" he insists. The movie, from an unpublished novel, is called Beau John. \n \n As a friend of Duke's who has read the galley proofs says that if the movie is as good as the novel, it could net a second Oscar for Wayne. His first was for his performance as Sheriff Rooster Cogburn in the 1969 movie True Grit. \n \n \"We'll probably shoot the picture this fall if we get the script ready in time.\" Duke says. \"It is not a western, although it could go that way. There's no patriarchal story that won't fit into a western background. \n \n Wayne has always believed in the western as an art form, and even compares the genre to Homer's \"The Land\" and \"The Odyssey\". Certainly no one has done more then John Wayne - the last cowboy- to make it so. A list of his films from Stagecoach to The Shootist is in itself a history of the American film western. His family and friends are sure there will be more westerns in the old cowboy's future. \n \n John Wayne may be tough, but he's not too tough to indulge in a little sentiment. He admits the outpouring of good wishes sent by fans concerned about his illness \"made me cry.\" \n \n Yet he is tough enough to insist that nothing will keep him down long. \"I'm a greedy old man.\" he says bluntly. \"Life's been good to me, and I want some more of it.\" \n \n By James Bacon",

    "document": "What is love bombing? \n \n Love bombing is a process of grooming in which a predator uses flattery, praise and the promise of a supreme alliance to fulfill their own agendas. By love bombing their victims, abusers are able to persuade their targets to fulfill their requests and desires. Love bombing is not only a tool used by covert manipulators to exploit their victims, it is also used in cults to ensure loyalty to the cult leader. In fact, there is much overlap between the behavior of cults and the abuse cycle of an abuser and his or her victim. \n \n While anyone can be the victim of love bombing, it has an especially powerful effect on children of narcissistic parents, because they have already been subconsciously programmed to seek approval, engage in people-pleasing habits and look for external validation as a way to survive their psychologically turbulent childhoods. \n \n When children of narcissists meet emotional predators in adulthood, they are especially susceptible to becoming ensnared in the web of a malignant narcissist. \n \n Love Bombing and Intermittent Reinforcement Work Together to Create an Environment of Uncertainty, Coercion and Control \n \n In a relationship with a pathological predator, love bombing is combined with intermittent reinforcement to create a sense of instability and longing in the victim. Intermittent reinforcement (in the context of psychological abuse) is a pattern of cruel, callous treatment mixed in with periodic affection. The abuser hands out \u201crewards\u201d such as affection, a compliment, or gifts sporadically and unpredictably throughout the abuse cycle. This causes the victim to perpetually seek their approval while settling for the crumbs of their occasional positive behavior. \n \n As author Adylen Birch writes, \u201cCreating fear of losing the relationship \u2013 and then relieving it periodically with episodes of love and attention \u2013 is the perfect manipulation.\u201d Much like the way a gambler at a slot machine becomes addicted to playing the game for a potential win despite the risk of major loss, a victim in the abuse cycle can become attached to the idea of getting a return on their \u201cinvestment\u201d in the relationship despite the toll it takes on their well-being. \n \n Intermittent reinforcement also affects our feelings towards our perpetrators, paradoxically bonding us more deeply to them and causing us to perceive their rare positive behaviors in an amplified way. Dr. Carver describes this as the \u201csmall kindness perception.\u201d As he notes in his article, \u201cLove and Stockholm Syndrome\u201d: \n \n In threatening and survival situations, we look for evidence of hope \u2013 a small sign that the situation may improve. When an abuser/controller shows the victim some small kindness, even though it is to the abusers benefit as well, the victim interprets that small kindness as a positive trait of the captor\u2026In relationships with abusers, a birthday card, a gift (usually provided after a period of abuse), or a special treat are interpreted as not only positive, but evidence that the abuser is not \u201call bad\u201d and may at some time correct his/her behavior. Abusers and controllers are often given positive credit for not abusing their partner, when the partner would have normally been subjected to verbal or physical abuse in a certain situation.\u201d \n \n Targets of emotional and psychological violence seek the love bombing that was so nourishing in the idealization phase, even as they are now being devalued and discarded by their abusers. This is not surprising, since love bombing, intermittent reinforcement and the effects of trauma work together to strengthen an intense trauma bond between target and abuser. \n \n There are three ways children of narcissists, who grow up scapegoated and diminished, are vulnerable to the tactics of love bombing. I discuss them below, as well as some \u201cimmunity methods\u201d to resist these manipulation tactics. \n \n 1. While hypercriticism puts us on the defensive, love-bombing disarms us initially. It mirrors our deepest desires to be wanted, desired, loved, cared for, heard and seen for who we truly are, down to every little nuance and quirk. \n \n When we are love bombed, there is an immediate sense of belonging and of kinship, something that is very attractive to children of narcissists, who feel very much like outcasts in their families as well as society. \n \n Narcissists and sociopaths are very good at \u201chooking\u201d us by pointing out our desirable physical attributes, personality traits, and/or accomplishments that deep down we want admired and recognized. At the same time, they fixate on those traits to further their own agenda, not because they actually care to know us deeply. They dig deep when they have to in order to get what they want (praise in return, sex, money, a place to live, etc.), but their affection for us is often short-lived and transient, escalating to contempt and envy should we ever threaten their sense of control over us. As Dr. Floyd (2013) writes: \n \n \u201cLove bombing is an extreme example of something that turns out to be relatively common\u2014something I call \u201ctoxic affection.\u201d If affection is the expression of love and fondness, then toxic affection is any such expression that has an ulterior motive. Perhaps I say I love you because I really do, and I want you to know that. Or, perhaps I say it only because I want to sleep with you, want to borrow money from you, or just want you to say it back to me. Using affection as a form of persuasion is often successful for the same reason that love bombing is: we want and need to be loved.\u201d \n \n Immunity method: Seek internal validation for those traits that you\u2019ve been love bombed with in the past. It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t embody what the predator has flattered you with, but that you no longer need to depend on them for your sole source of self-esteem. Surround yourself with healthy people who recognize, rather than exploit, those qualities in you. Genuine compliments are given freely, without a need for you to do something in return or be a certain way for a person. Be alert to over the top flattery merged with a request and unwarranted praise. Even if the praise does seem warranted, just be aware that some (but certainly not all) praise has a hidden purpose. \n \n 2. Since children of narcissists are often triangulated by their parents, pitted against their own siblings, they fall for predators who make them feel special and unique. \n \n This is the type of attention that children of narcissists always craved to receive in childhood and they get plenty of validation from an emotional predator that grooms them. Yet they later become retraumatized by these same manipulators when they are \u201ctriangulated\u201d with former or new harem members and lovers. This causes targets of malignant narcissists to feel even more diminished and lacking, never feeling quite \u201cenough\u201d and feeling as if they have to compete with others in order to be seen as important. \n \n Immunity method: Pinpoint what makes you irreplaceable and resist comparing yourself to others negatively. Remember that you may be seeing an abuser\u2019s new shiny target or someone they triangulated you with fresh eyes, and you are unaware of what makes you truly beautiful and outstanding. Look at yourself with fresh eyes instead \u2013 if you were an outsider looking in, what amazing traits, talents and qualities would you notice about yourself? What makes you special and unique? \n \n Cultivate an authentic relationship with what makes you stand out and embrace visibility in areas where you may have previously hidden yourself to avoid the spotlight for fear of punishment or reprisal. Bring in healthier social feedback when needed to brainstorm what those areas could be. When you have a deep inner knowing that no one could ever replace you, you don\u2019t find it necessary for someone else to make you feel that way. \n \n You can then become much more selective about who you let into your life. Manipulative, toxic people can no longer gain easy access by just being charming or sweet \u2013 they have to show up and be there for you in real ways in order for you to take them seriously. \n \n 3. We mistake superficial alliances for deep, meaningful and once-in-a-lifetime connections. \n \n Children of narcissists are forced to navigate the world alone and become their own rugged heroes. We tend to our own wounds, our own scraped knees and emotional voids due to the necessity for survival. With no supportive caretakers to mend our aches in either childhood or adulthood, we find solace in even the most superficial of connections, holding onto them for indications that we have finally found a \u201chome\u201d for our tattered hearts and weary souls. \n \n As author Peg Streep writes in \u201cWhy Unloved Daughters Fall for Narcissists,\u201d we often don\u2019t notice the red flags as much as we do the potential for connection: \n \n \u201cBecause you\u2019re so hungry for love and connection\u2014and still trying to fill the hole in your heart left by an unloving mother\u2014you\u2019re likely not to notice how he amps the volume and drama. You stay focused on the make-up sex and the warm feelings of reassurance you feel when he tells you not to worry.\u201d \n \n Unfortunately, the fast-forwarding nature of the type of relationship that has love-bombing, mixed with the intense chemistry of finally being noticed and seen, makes for a rather addictive biochemical and psychological cocktail. We become addicted to the attention because we mistake it for authentic connection. \n \n Immunity method: Differentiate between connection and flattery early on to avoid investing in people who may not have your best interests at heart. Assess which relationships and friendships in your life have the capacity to grow into deeper alliances and which ones fall short of authentic partnership and true compatibility. The former usually takes some time to build and is built over time with someone who is trustworthy, consistent, transparent and reliable. The latter is often a quick fix or sleight of hand, a magic show followed by a disappearing act. \n \n Flattery, even if it is based on truly amazing qualities you might have, rarely lasts long-term. Connection, on the other hand, is built on a solid foundation \u2013 not just on empty compliments, but on genuine rapport, support, and intimacy. It involves two individuals who both share parts of themselves with vulnerability, along with a respect for personal boundaries and reciprocity. Connection, not crumbs, is what nourishes you long-term. Remember that you are truly worthy and deserving of nothing less. \n \n References \n \n Birch, A. (2016, December 18).

A surprise romantic getaway to a secluded countryside cottage for the weekend. A thoughtful phone call when you least expect it. All the signs of the beginning a of loving, caring relationship, right? \n \n Well, perhaps not. In fact, they might be signposts for the opposite, or what is commonly known as 'love bombing'. \n \n According to Dale Archer, a psychiatrist and author, 'love bombing' occurs when people are showered with over-the-top displays of attention and affection. And, we're not just talking romantic gestures and the occasional home-cooked meal, but romantic conversations, talks of the 'future' together, and constant contact via social media, phone calls and messages. The difference between a solid loving relationship and one that is subject to 'love bombing' is what happens next... \n \n ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW \n \n More often than not, 'love bombing' is when these displays of 'affection' are grandiose and really over the top, leading people to quickly think they might have found their 'soul mate' or 'the one'. However, they soon find the loving, caring, affection, and understanding behaviour from their partner flips, resulting in unreasonable, controlling and manipulative traits. \n \n What is 'love bombing'? \n \n In essence, 'love bombing' is a form of conditioning tool (otherwise known as a form of abuse), whereby one person in the relationship drowns the other in displays of 'love' to maintain power and control. \n \n MOST POPULAR \n \n 'Healthy relationships build slowly, and are based on a series of actions, not a flood of words,' Archer writes for a blog post titled 'The Manipulative Partner's Most Devious Tactic' for Psychology Today. \n \n Rex Features \n \n The term is widely believed to have been first used by the Unification Church of the United States in the 1970s, whose cult leaders used love as a form of ammunition 'to con followers into committing mass suicide and murder', according to Archer. \n \n 'Pimps and gang leaders use 'love bombing' to encourage loyalty and obedience as well,' he writes. \n \n How does it work? \n \n First things first, all relationships are different and just because a partner showers you with love and affection does not mean they're narcissistic or have psychopathic tendencies that might lead to 'love bombing'. Some people genuinely are very loving and thoughtful and these sorts of gestures continue long into the relationship with no catch. \n \n ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW \n \n However, those who use 'love bombing' as a form of control often reinforce their love for their victim by showering them with affection when they act in a certain way that pleases the abuser, and later they will punish that person for behaving in a way that the abuser doesn't like. \n \n For example, an abuser will post an adorable snap of the two of you at dinner to Facebook, for all to see, with an equally mushy caption about how much you mean to him and how happy he is to be spending the evening with a gorgeous creature like you. The same person, though, when you head out for a dinner without him or go to a club with your friends, will call you ten times and accuse you of cheating/abandoning/not caring enough about him. \n \n ''Love bombing' works because humans have a natural need to feel good about who we are, and often we can't fill this need on our own,' writes Archer. \n \n How do you spot 'love-bombing'? \n \n Getting butterflies, falling head-over-heels, and feeling like you're falling madly in love with a new boyfriend/girlfriend is very normal in the early months of a relationship. \n \n But, according to Archer, potential love bombing victims often find themselves trapped into having constant contact with a partner, which ultimately convinces them the intensity of the communication is a sign of success and love.",

That's according to experts cautioning people in new relationships about so-called \"love bombing.\" Not familiar with the term? Elle UK \"delve[s] into the worrying behaviors of a 'love bomber,'\" explaining that it takes time for people to truly get to know each other as their relationships deepen. When someone is over-the-top awesome in the beginning of a relationship\u2014always sending flowers and offering up compliments and affection\u2014it could actually be a \"conditioning tool (otherwise known as a form of abuse).\" PsychCentral calls it a \"process of grooming.\" Constant flowers themselves aren't the worrisome sign\u2014the shift is; ie, if the attention goes from positive and affectionate to controlling and cruel. If the person being \"bombed\" falls fast and hard it can be harder to see that shift. Love bombers, by the way, are narcissists, and they're usually men. In Psychology Today, psychiatrist Dale Archer dates the term \"love bombing\" to the 1970s, when Unification Church of the United States (aka the \"Moonies\") first used it. Cult leaders like David Koresh and Charles Manson would employ this tactic to woo followers and then con them into nefarious acts. Archer argues that idealization isn't necessarily harmful when it grows over time, but that the \"common thread\" in love bombing is intense courtship and idealization over just a matter of days or weeks. Soon, \"love bombers exploit the natural human need for self worth, and turn it into shame, regret, and self-loathing.\" (One study finds that men tend to feel more entitled and be more narcissistic than women.)",

We're told there was a bench warrant out for the 37-year-old's arrest for violating her probation. \n \n Earlier this year, Dillard-Bothuell plead guilty to purchasing a pistol without a permit and was put on a 2-year probation period. \n \n Police also confirm that Child Protective Services has removed two other children, a 4-year-old and a 10-month-old, from the home. \n \n A day after 12-year-old Charlie Bothuell V was found alive in the basement of his father's Detroit home, new details are emerging about his strange 10-day disappearance. \n \n Police say Charlie was home schooled and subjected to an exercise regime, though further details were not provided. \n \n Bothuell was discovered hiding behind a 55-gallon drum while officers were executing their fourth search warrant on the Nicolet Place home Wednesday afternoon. \n \n We're told a PVC pipe with blood on it was taken away from the home as evidence. \n \n Charlie was released from the hospital Thursday morning and is now with his mother where he has been interviewed by the FBI and other investigators. \n \n Action News has also learned of a new twist in the case. The uncle of Monique Charlie's stepmother has a listed address three doors away from where the search had been going on. \n \n That home is the end unit of the same condominium building. The units are connected by an underground hallway. \n \n Charlie's stepmother's uncle is Detroit attorney Godfrey Dillard. Action News reached him on the phone to ask about the case and Monique, and he refused to comment. \n \n Godfrey Dillard recently announced his run for Michigan Attorney General. \n \n It\u2019s unclear if police are investigating a connection to Godfrey Dillard\u2019s listed address. \n \n When his son was found Wednesday, Charlie's father, Charlie Bothuell IV, spoke out emotionally and said he was hoping to be reunited with his son. That has not yet happened.",

Sources tell Fox that the boy was home-schooled under a strict regimen that included beatings with a PVC pipe, and investigators have removed evidence including bloodied clothing from the home. Investigators say the boy didn't appear to be captive behind the barricade, but they don't believe he could have erected it himself. Police didn't find him on four previous searches of the home and it's not clear if he was in the basement during those visits. His father\u2014who was being interviewed by Nancy Grace when he was informed his son had been found\u2014says he had no idea that Charlie was in the basement. Sources say the boy has told investigators that it was his stepmother, Monica Bothuell, who helped him hide out in the basement\u2014and in another twist, she was arrested yesterday on an unrelated weapons charge, CNN reports.

It won roughly 40 percent of the seats allocated by party voting, and a higher percentage of the seats contested by individual candidates. And the final nine governorates voting on Tuesday included the historic Brotherhood strongholds of Gharbiya and Daqahliyya in the Delta, where a number of the group\u2019s best known candidates are running, including the former member of Parliament Mohamed Beltaggi. \n \n Final results remain uncertain, in part because Egypt\u2019s military rulers have yet to spell out the formula that will be used to allocate seats among parties according to their share of the vote. \n \n In an interview Tuesday, Essam el-Erian, a Freedom and Justice leader who was elected to parliament from Giza, said he still doubted the party would win more than half the seats. \n \n \u201cNothing is impossible but it would be very difficult,\u201d he said. \n \n Still, the Brotherhood has played down its electoral strength before. In the weeks after Mr. Mubarak\u2019s exit last February its leaders suggested that the Brotherhood would seek only a third of the seats in the next Parliament and it is not contesting most of them and expecting to win at least 40 percent. \n \n The Brotherhood has said repeatedly that it intends to form a coalition or unity government, in part to avoid unnerving Egyptian liberals or Westerners who may fear an Islamist takeover. It may also wish to share the responsibility for what is expected to be a difficult period of adjustment for the Egyptian state and economy. \n \n But winning a clear majority would enable the Brotherhood\u2019s party, if it chose, to govern without forming a coalition. And removing the necessity of such a coalition government would diminish the power of the partners in any alliance as well as any other parties outside the coalition. \n \n That would reduce the clout of the ultraconservative Islamists who have so far come in second-place in the first two rounds of the voting, winning as much as 25 percent of the seats by most estimates. And it would also reduce the voice of the various liberal parties, led by the business-friendly Free Egyptians and the left-leaning Social Democrats, who have won most of the remainder of the seats. \n \n The Brotherhood has so far sought to ally itself with the liberals rather than the most conservative Islamists and it has reiterated that it has no plans to form an all-Islamist government. The strength of the ultraconservatives, known as Salafis, has been the biggest surprise of the voting so far. Many espouse hard-line views seeking sharp reductions in the sale of alcohol, opposing women\u2019s participation in political leadership or public life, and potentially restricting arts and popular culture deemed profane or sacrilegious. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Tuesday\u2019s voting also sets up an potential confrontation between the new Parliament and Egypt\u2019s military rulers. Brotherhood leaders have said they expect the Parliament to take authority over the hiring and firing of a prime minister to run the interim government. The military rulers have said they intend to retain that authority and allocate very little power to the Parliament. \n \n The lower house of Parliament is Egypt\u2019s primarily legislative body, and Field Marshall Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, the top military officer who is now acting as de facto chief executive, has scheduled its first session for Jan. 23, two days before the anniversary of the outbreak of protests that ousted Mr. Mubarak. \n \n With the same anniversary looming over Mr. Mubarak\u2019s trial, prosecutors began to lay out their case that he was culpable for the hundreds of people killed by security forces during the 18 days of protests that ended his rule. Human rights lawyers representing those killed in the shooting have complained with growing alarm that the prosecution has failed to push hard enough or marshal a strong enough case to win a conviction. \n \n On Tuesday the prosecutor appeared to argue for Mr. Mubarak\u2019s punishment with new vigor. \n \n \u201cHe deserves an end of humiliation and indignity \u2014 from the presidential palace to the defendants\u2019 cage and then the harshest penalty,\u201d the prosecutor, Mustafa Suleiman, told the court, according to a report from a journalist from The Associated Press inside the courtroom. (The authorities have strictly limited access.) \n \n Witnesses said he spoke with his back turned to Mr. Mubarak and his two sons, Alaa and Gamal, who were corralled in the metal cage that is the standard docket in Egyptian criminal courts. All three face charges of using official positions to enrich themselves. \n \n In laying out his case that Mr. Mubarak was responsible for the deaths of demonstrators, the prosecutor also focused attention on Gamal Mubarak, who had become an important powerbroker in the ruling party and his father\u2019s heir apparent before the revolution. The notion of hereditary success was to many Egyptians an outrage too great to bear, just as similar schemes to pass power within a ruling family have apparently proven too much for the citizens of Tunisia, Libya and Syria as well. \n \n \u201cHere we have a president who devoted the last decade of his rule to engineer something that no one in Egypt ever dared to do before \u2014 the succession of his son,\u201d said the prosecutor declared, according to a report from The A.P. \n \n Mr. Mubarak was once again wheeled into the court room on a hospital gurney, his head resting on a pillow, and remained prone for what his lawyers have said were health reasons. ||||| The chief prosecutor in Hosni Mubarak's trial accused the ousted Egyptian leader on Tuesday of imposing \"tyrannical rule\" and devoting the last 10 years of his three decades in power to ensure his son would succeed him. \n \n Former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak is wheeled into a court house in Cairo, Egypt, Monday, Jan. 2, 2012.

On trial with Mubarak are his two sons, Gamal, his one-time heir apparent,... (Associated Press) \n \n Mustafa Suleiman's comments came in the first of three days in which the prosecution will state its case against Mubarak and 10 other defendants, including his two sons, his security chief and a close associate of the ousted leader who is now a fugitive. \n \n The trial began Aug. 3 but has been bogged down in procedural matters, including a demand by lawyers representing the victims that the presiding Judge Ahmed Rifaat be removed. That request alone took a separate court about three months to rule on and was eventually denied. \n \n Mubarak is charged with complicity in the killing of more than 800 protesters in the crackdown on a popular uprising that forced him out of office on Feb. 11. The two sons, Alaa and one-time heir apparent Gamal, face corruption charges in the same case. \n \n With his back to the defendants' cage, Suleiman delivered a scathing critique of Mubarak's rule, branding the 83-year-old a corrupt man whose lust for power will for ever tarnish his legacy. \n \n \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity _ from the presidential palace to the defendants' cage and then the harshest penalty,\" said Suleiman, whose hour-long comments mesmerized the courtroom, set up at a police academy that once bore the former leader's name. \n \n He said the corruption of Mubarak's regime peaked shortly before the anti-Mubarak uprising broke out in January last year, when authorities engineered what is widely viewed as the most fraudulent parliamentary election seen in Egypt since the army seized power in a 1952 coup. Mubarak's ruling party won all but a handful seats in the November-December vote in what Suleiman described as part of a strategy to succession. \n \n A banker-turned-politician, Gamal began his climb to power in 2000. By the time the 18-day uprising broke out on Jan. 25, he was effectively in charge of the Cabinet and the ruling party, wielding more powers than the prime minister. \n \n \"Here we have a president who devoted the last decade of his rule to engineer something that no one in Egypt ever dared to do before _ the succession of his son,\" said the prosecutor. \n \n Mubarak could face the death penalty if convicted of complicity in the killing the protesters. \n \n Mubarak was succeeded by military generals beholden to the former leader for their ascent through the military ranks. They are led by a general who served Mubarak for 20 years as defense minister. Many within the protest movement believe Mubarak and his two sons were only arrested and put on trial under pressure from a series of massive protests to demand that the three be held accountable. \n \n While the two sons are held in a prison south of Cairo along with nearly 40 stalwarts of the toppled regime, Mubarak has since his arrest in April been held in hospital under custody. \n \n (This version CORRECTS Updates with details, adds byline, links photos, corrects that Suleiman is the trial's chief prosecutor, not Egypt's.)",

The EgyptAir plane was hijacked on Tuesday while flying from the Egyptian Mediterranean coastal city of Alexandria to the capital, Cairo,... (Associated Press) \n \n LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) \u2014 An Egyptian man hijacked an EgyptAir plane Tuesday and forced it to land in Cyprus, where most passengers were eventually allowed to get off, though four crew members and three passengers remained on board with the hijacker, Egyptian and Cypriot officials said. \n \n The man's motivation was unclear, but Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades said the hijacking was \"not something that has to do with terrorism\" and a Cyprus government official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation, said the man \"seems (to be) in love.\" \n \n A civil aviation official, also speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn't allowed to disclose details of ongoing negotiations, said the man gave negotiators the name of a woman who lives in Cyprus and asked to give her an envelope. It's unclear what relationship she and the man have. \n \n Flight MS181 took off from the Mediterranean coastal city of Alexandria en route to Cairo with at least 55 passengers, including 26 foreigners, and a seven-member crew. \n \n An official with flight-tracking website FlightRadar24 said the plane showed no immediate signs of distress.

At a news conference in Cairo, Egypt's Civil Aviation minister, Sharif Fathi, refused to identify him. \n \n Earlier, Egyptian government spokesman Hossam al-Queish said the hijacker was Ibrahim Samaha, but an Egyptian woman who identified herself as Samaha's wife said her husband is not the hijacker and was on his way to Cairo so he could fly to the U.S. to attend a conference. \n \n The woman, who identified herself only as Nahla, told the Egyptian private TV network ONTV in a phone interview that her husband had never been to Cyprus and that a photo on Egyptian and regional TV channels that supposedly showed the hijacker was not him. Later, the official Middle East News Agency gave a different name for the hijacker. \n \n Al-Queish, the government spokesman, also told the private CBC TV network that authorities could not confirm that the hijacker had explosives on him.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 An EgyptAir plane with about 60 people aboard was hijacked Tuesday while flying from the coastal city of Alexandria to Cairo, and then forced to land in Cyprus, reports the AP. Fortunately, it appears to have ended without violence after hours of negotiations, with all aboard freed and the hijacker arrested. Details were still emerging about his motivation, but Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades previously said it was \"not something that has to do with terrorism,\" reports the AP, and a Cyprus government official said the man \"seems (to be) in love.\" A civil aviation official said the man gave negotiators the name of a woman who lives in Cyprus and asked to give her an envelope. It's unclear what relationship she and the man have, but some reports say she is his estranged wife. Asked whether the hijacking involved romance, the Cyprian president laughed and said, \"Always, there is a woman involved.\" However, much confusion surrounded the incident, with the BBC citing reports that he had asked for the release of female prisoners in Egypt. There was also some confusion about the identity of the hijacker, who reportedly claimed to have explosives on him and had allowed most of the passengers to leave the plane upon landing. At a news conference prior to the arrest, Egypt's Civil Aviation minister refused to identify him. Earlier, an Egyptian government spokesman offered up a name, but an Egyptian woman who identified herself as his wife said her husband is not the hijacker and was on his way to Cairo so he could fly to the US to attend a conference.

    "document": "WHO, WHAT, WHY? \n \n The Magazine answers... \n \n Karolina Kurkova's belly indentation \n \n Enlarge Image \n \n Underwear model Karolina Kurkova has no belly button. Is a barely-there navel for cosmetic or medical reasons? The newspapers call it the \"riddle of the \u00a32.5m beauty\". The beauty in question is Czech supermodel Karolina Kurkova. The riddle is her non-existent belly button. Its absence was noticed this week when the 24-year-old graced a US catwalk for lingerie giant Victoria Secret. While most of us have an \"outie\" or an \"innie\", Ms Kurkova has a smooth indentation (although sometimes a tummy button is airbrushed onto her photos in post-production). Otherwise known as a navel, the belly button is the rounded, knotty depression in the centre of the abdomen caused by the detachment of the umbilical cord that fed you while in the womb. We all have umbilical cords, so why don't we all have a belly button? Ms Kurkova has not spoken publicly about how she came to have a smooth navel, and all her agent will say is \"she's not an alien\". THE ANSWER May be result of abdominal operation in infancy Or umbilical cord left to detach naturally Adults may have artificial navel after stomach surgery, or cosmetic reshaping But Karolina Kurkova is not saying Some have no belly button as a result of the surgery needed to correct abdominal problems at birth, often either an umbilical hernia, or a condition known as gastroschisis - born with the stomach and intestines poking through a hole in the abdominal wall. This is what happened to Rob Swainson, 26, of Bournemouth, who spent his very first hours in surgery to rectify this unfortunate mistake of anatomy. As a result, he has a cross-shaped scar in the middle of his tummy instead of a belly button. \"I thought about having one constructed when I was getting interested in girls, but not for long,\" he says, adding that people are more surprised by his scar than his lack of a navel. \"You only have to look at Michael Jackson to realise it's probably best to live with what you've got.\" And while it is standard practice to clamp, cut, then seal a newborn's umbilical cord to prevent infection, in lotus births - or umbilical non-severance births - the cord and placenta are left to drop off naturally. \"But that's not at all common in this country, and there's always still something there to show where the cord was attached,\" says a Royal College of Midwives spokesman. Cosmetic surgery Adults, too, may lose their navel after stomach surgery or having skin grafts taken from their tummy. Some may have an artificial belly button made. WHO, WHAT, WHY? A regular feature in the BBC News Magazine - aiming to answer some of the questions behind the headlines And thanks to the trend for midriff-baring tops, cosmetic surgeons have developed an operation called an umbilicoplasty for those who want a more aesthetically pleasing navel. Most procedures involve transforming an outie to an innie, or resizing a large or lop-sided innie to be less obvious. Rajiv Grover, a consultant plastic surgeon and secretary of Baaps (British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Sugeons), says it is rare to do this for cosmetic reasons alone, as over time the scar pulls and tightens. However, there are certain procedures during which a new navel may be fashioned. \"The two main reasons are, one, they've developed a small hernia - a weakness in the abdominal wall - which needs removing; or two, as part of a tummy tuck. This involves pulling down the extra skin and fat, and to do this the surgeon must cut the belly button free from the muscles underneath, and make and reattach a new one once the loose skin is pulled taut.\" Ms Kurkova's lack of navel doesn't seem to be hindering her career. Forbes magazine ranked her as the eighth highest paid model in the world last year, with estimated annual earnings of over \u00a32m. What she's got is far more eye-catching than what she hasn't. Below is a selection of your comments. I too was short-changed a navel at birth; although to this day I have no idea why. I suspect being born three months premature via caesarean section may have meant the tissue was pliable enough to gently set into a mild indentation. Any doctors out there who can confirm? I used to tell people I was grown in a vat... Still, no belly-button fluff. \n \n Riv, High Wycombe I lost my belly button after abdominal surgery five years ago. I've found it very useful on training session icebreakers when we are asked for an unusual fact about ourselves, although I often have to prove it. \n \n Darren Jalland, Larbert, Scotland I have exactly the same sort of smooth indentation. It's the result of a repair of an umbilical hernia when I was two years old, 65 years ago. For many years now this operation, if done in the UK, would be completed with a cosmetic belly button. Perhaps The Czech republic hadn't caught up with the modern technique 24 years ago. These days very few UK children would have this operation done at all as it is now realised that most childhood umbilical hernias correct themselves by the age of three or four. \n \n Maureen, Birmingham Sixty years ago I was house-surgeon to a London surgeon, a real Lancelot Spratt character. He thought the umbilicus was a nasty dirty place and when operating on anyone's abdomen he would, without permission or consultation, cut it out. My job was to invent some story to tell the patient why it had been necessary. How times have changed. \n \n Bill Hunt I too have no belly button, the result of an umbilical hernia operation at the age of two. I have a long scar across my stomach, which meant I felt self-conscious wearing a bikini in my teens. I believe this operation is now performed with keyhole surgery leaving minimal scarring. \n \n Sarah W, Bournemouth, England British heptathlete Kelly Sotherton Kelly Sotherton, the heptathlete, has a \"smoothie\" too. \n \n James, Leamington How the umbilical cord is treated at birth always affects the cosmetic appearance of the umbilicus or tummy button. Long ago in a normal delivery it was the practise to allow the placenta to stay attached, unless the baby's blood group was different to the mother's. How it is treated after birth varies country to country and health service to health service over history. With the advent of sterile plastic clamps, the neat way they were tied before was not allowed as the clamp had to come from a sterilized delivery pack of necessities. This gave a different effect and one could not continue to treat it by retying. There is much more but suffice to say, it is not the person's make-up, or the midwife's fault, or the babies' (though parents can stop babies from crying and coughing or eating too much too soon, as excess protrudes the area). \n \n Deena Mary Jones, Bromsgrove My dogs have no belly buttons, because their mothers gently chewed the wound from the umbilical chord, and licked them while they were healing. She continued doing so until there was virtually no scar from birth \n \n Conor, Dublin I am currently working on masters degree in chiropractic. Anatomy is a major part of the course. In the early embryo, the gut actually goes straight through. Differential growth then causes all the folding and rearrangement of the abdominal organs. For quite a while, the umbilicus is relatively large and the gut actually folds into it. As the embryo/foetus grows the umbilicus gets relatively smaller and the gut is pushed into the abdomen. In some cases the gut can get trapped on the outside needing surgery after birth. \n \n David Elliott, Derby and Pontypridd A lot of premature babies have no or small belly buttons, we call my son's a belly-popper as it looks more like a press stud. \n \n Jon, Oxford My husband is 37 and he had an umbilical hernia for most of his life, which meant he had no naval because of it. But due to medical reasons he had the hernia removed and now has a belly button which was reconstructed from the tissue left behind. \n \n Jo Thomas, Preston My cousin has no belly button as his body was attached directly to the wall of his mum's womb during development. No umbilical cord developed but he is fine, he has a line where we have a belly button. \n \n Sam, London, UK My husband (who may wish to remain nameless) also has a smooth indentation instead of a typical belly button. This is because his mother was a midwife and her colleagues \"did a good job on him\" apparently. \n \n Proud Wife, Leeds, UK I put my lack of belly button down to a very precise knot, tied by a perfectionist midwife. Not the experience I had with aliens. \n \n James, Glasgow Karolina Kurkova does have a belly button. If you look on her own website, there is a picture of her wearing just a bra and pants and she has a very normal navel. Either it's been airbrushed in or airbrushed out in the other photo. \n \n David, Reading, UK My nephew was born with gastroghesis, a condition that meant all his internal organs are developed outside the body instead of inside. When he was born they operated, and now he is fine, although instead of a belly button, he has a large scar running from one side of him to the other. We call it his smiley belly. \n \n Terence Turner, Chelmsford, Essex I used to have a boyfriend with a dent of a bellybutton just like Karolina. He joked that it was because he had been made, not born, but I never found out the real reason. \n \n Amy A childhood friend of mine had no belly button as she was born as a conjoined twin, her brother had a belly button, but she did not. \n \n Colin Leadbeatter, London, United Kingdom Sorry Colin, but I think your friend was having you on - conjoined twins are always the same sex, so your friend must lack a belly button for some other reason. \n \n Jan, Redditch, Worcs My mother had no belly button after an operation in her 30s for umbilical hernia. She was left with a scar across her tummy with a small lump at either end and slight indentation in the middle. My father used to say it was her zip fastener for future operations. I reckon that would be a very good idea to save being cut open next time and merely need zipping up afterwards, it would also save the surgeons a lot of time and trouble. \n \n Marilyn Minnikin, Keighley, Yorkshire, England Adam and Eve didn't have belly buttons either. \n \n Edward, London I think people with scars or interesting bodies are far more beautiful than supposed perfect ones. There's something lovely about getting to know someone's body for the first time, and growing to love it, warts and all. Scars and oddities can be lovely in themselves, for the story they tell about the person bearing them. \n \n Jen, York I was impressed by the fact that this \"navel-gazing\" story appeared on World Philosophy Day! \n \n Rebecca H, Sunny Eastbourne So there's a global economic crisis, and you're trying to distract us about whether some poor girl has a navel or not.

Usually a portion of the intestine has popped through the abdominal muscles, causing an oversized \"outie.\" \n \n \"Most people have them fixed, because you should have any hernias fixed,\" Schulman said. \n \n That analysis could dispel rumors suggested that Kurkova had a vanity surgery. The media frenzy over the barely-there navel has stoked rumors that run the gamut of stories of a tummy tuck gone awry to suggestions that Kurkova was simply born sans button. \n \n Dr. Schulman is quick to quash the latter: \"It's not accurate to say that someone just does not have a belly button.\" \n \n Sign up for BREAKING NEWS Emails privacy policy Thanks for subscribing! ||||| A Houston woman was forced to ask her doctor an unimaginable question -- where's my belly button?\"I went in with the belly button and I'd like to know what you did with it?

    "document": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 A Swedish doctor says four women who received transplanted wombs have had embryos transferred into them in an attempt to get pregnant. \n \n FILE - In this April 4, 2012 photo made available by the University of Goteborg in Sweden, the Swedish research team practices before the operations to transplant wombs at the Sahlgrenska Hospital in... (Associated Press) \n \n He would not say on Monday whether any of the women had succeeded. In all, nine women in Sweden have received new wombs since 2012, but two had to have them removed because of complications. \n \n The women received wombs donated by their mothers or other close relatives in an experimental procedure designed to test whether it's possible to transfer a uterus so a woman can give birth to her own biological child. The women had in vitro fertilization before the transplants, using their own eggs to make embryos. \n \n \"We have already begun transferring embryos into four of the women and plan to make attempts with the others when they are ready,\" said Dr. Mats Brannstrom, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Goteburg, who is leading the research. \n \n Brannstrom predicted that three or four of the seven women might successfully give birth. \n \n \"One or two more will perhaps get pregnant and miscarry, and one or two won't be able to get pregnant,\" he said. \n \n There have been two previous attempts to transplant a womb \u2014 in Turkey and Saudi Arabia \u2014 but both failed to produce babies. Doctors in Britain and Hungary also are planning similar operations, but using wombs from women who had just died. \n \n Brannstrom said any woman in the study who does get pregnant will be on a low dose of drugs to keep from rejecting the transplanted womb and will be monitored as a high-risk pregnancy. \n \n The transplants are intended to benefit women unable to have children because they lost a uterus to cancer or were born without one. \n \n Some doctors said women who got pregnant with a new uterus would have to be watched carefully for how the womb progresses throughout pregnancy. \n \n \"There are questions about how the physiological changes in the uterus will affect the mother and whether the transplanted uterus will be conducive to a growing baby,\" said Dr. Charles Kingsland, a spokesman for Britain's Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and a gynecologist at Liverpool Women's Hospital. \n \n In a study published last week, Brannstrom and colleagues described the procedures used to transplant the nine wombs and said there were \"mild rejection episodes\" in four patients. \n \n He said the transplanted wombs would be removed after a maximum of two pregnancies. \n \n Other experts called it a promising step but said it would be crucial that babies get enough nutrients from the mother's blood supply. \n \n \"We really don't know if the blood flow to the uterus will increase and adapt in the same way,\" as in a regular pregnancy, said Dr. Yacoub Khalaf, director of the Assisted Conception unit at Guy's and St. Thomas' hospital in London. \n \n \"It is a good sign they have done the (embryo) transfers,\" Khalaf said. \"But a live birth will be the best validation that this works.\" ||||| Swedish medical team hoping for world first as women born without uterus or who lost it to cancer get embryo transfers \n \n Four of nine women given pioneering womb transplants in Sweden have now also had embryos transferred, the pioneering Swedish doctor treating them has said. \n \n Dr Mats Brannstrom, professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at Gothenburg University, said his team had embarked on a programme of embryo transfer for the women, who were either born without a womb or lost it as a result of cancer. All have ovaries so were able to produce eggs that were fertilised using IVF. \n \n Brannstrom predicted that three or four of the nine women might succeed in giving birth, which would be a world first. Other womb transplants have taken place in Saudi Arabia and Turkey but no recipients have yet managed to have a child. A pregnancy was achieved in Turkey, but it failed after two months. \n \n \"We have already begun transferring embryos into four of the women and plan to make attempts with the others when they are ready,\" said Brannstrom. He would not say whether any of the women were pregnant at the moment. In a study published last week, the team said that there were \"mild rejection episodes\" in four women who received donated wombs. Two patients had to have the uterus removed because of complications. \n \n Brannstrom's technique is controversial because he is accepting wombs donated by living women, who are relatives or friends of his patients. Elsewhere, wombs from dead donors have been used. \n \n Dr Richard Smith, head of the UK charity Womb Transplant UK, which is trying to raise money to carry out transplants here, has said that large chunks of blood vessels had to be removed from the donor as well as the uterus itself, raising the risks of the operation for the donor. In the UK, there would be ethical questions because the operation is not a life-saving procedure, he said. \n \n The women will have to take drugs throughout their pregnancy to ensure their body does not reject the organ. They will also have to be watched carefully for how the womb progresses throughout pregnancy. \n \n Dr Charles Kingsland, a spokesman for Britain's Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: \"There are questions about how the physiological changes in the uterus will affect the mother and whether the transplanted uterus will be conducive to a growing baby.\" \n \n Brannstrom said the transplanted wombs would be removed after a maximum of two pregnancies.",

    "document": "Not very long after God told some at St. Joseph Abbey that the way out of financial hardship might be selling the monks\u2019 handcrafted caskets, the state of Louisiana arrived with a different message. \n \n It was a cease-and-desist order and came with threats of thousands of dollars in fines and possible criminal prosecution. \n \n \u201cBefore we even sold a casket,\u201d St. Joseph Abbot Justin Brown said in a recent interview in the picturesque abbey, which is located about an hour\u2019s drive from New Orleans, on the other side of Lake Pontchartrain. Now a band of libertarian lawyers is hoping that the honey-colored Louisiana cypress coffins provide the vehicle for a Supreme Court review of government economic regulations. \n \n Brown, a soft-spoken man who is only the fifth leader of a monastery that dates to 1889, said he had not known that in Louisiana only licensed funeral directors are allowed to sell \u201cfuneral merchandise.\u201d \n \n That means that St. Joseph Abbey must either give up the casket-selling business or become a licensed funeral establishment, which would require a layout parlor for 30 people, a display area for the coffins, the employment of a licensed funeral director and an embalming room. \n \n \u201cReally,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a big box.\u201d \n \n And so, after much prayer and two failed attempts to get the Louisiana legislature to change the law, the monks went to federal court. \n \n The monks won round one in July, when U.S. District Judge Stanwood R. Duval Jr. ruled Louisiana\u2019s restrictions unconstitutional, saying \u201cthe sole reason for these laws is the economic protection of the funeral industry.\u201d \n \n The Louisiana State Board of Embalmers and Funeral Directors, which has argued that the law protects consumers, has appealed, and the circuit court in New Orleans will hear the case in early June. \n \n The monks are represented by the Arlington County-based Institute for Justice, which has a knack for picking empathetic, working-class parties \u2014 hair braiders, flower arrangers, city tour guides \u2014 to personify what it says is its battle against government regulation that strangles free enterprise. \n \n The group is on a constant watch to find the perfect case to challenge a series of economic regulation decisions nearly unbroken since the New Deal.

The state has no legal requirement that anyone be buried in a casket, and, under federal rules, funeral directors must accept a casket that a family has purchased elsewhere. \n \n Thus, Louisianans are free to purchase a casket online from Wal-Mart or Costco, Judge Duval noted, but not from an in-state casket-maker. \n \n Still, the Louisiana board argues, courts are simply not free to overturn economic regulation laws that have some rational basis. \n \n And, the board said, if it has the \u201cincidental consequence of economic protectionism, such a consequence does not render Louisiana\u2019s statutory scheme constitutionally infirm.\u201d To second-guess the legislature is to return to the days before the New Deal, when courts imposed their own economic judgment, the board said \n \n The Institute for Justice\u2019s Mellor replies that protectionism is different. \n \n \u201cThe standard of review is so favorably tilted to the government that legitimate occupations are foreclosed \u2014 or entry into the occupations is so heavily conditioned \u2014 that they basically become cartels or monopolies protected by government edict,\u201d he said. \n \n Federal appeals courts have split in evaluating similar laws.

Now a band of libertarian lawyers is hoping that the honey-colored Louisiana cypress coffins provide the vehicle for a Supreme Court review of government economic regulations. \n \n Brown, a soft-spoken man who is only the fifth leader of a monastery that dates to 1889, said he had not known that in Louisiana only licensed funeral directors are allowed to sell \u201cfuneral merchandise.\u201d \n \n That means that St. Joseph Abbey must either give up the casket-selling business or become a licensed funeral establishment, which would require a layout parlor for 30 people, a display area for the coffins, the employment of a licensed funeral director and an embalming room. \n \n \u201cReally,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a big box.\u201d \n \n And so, after much prayer and two failed attempts to get the Louisiana legislature to change the law, the monks went to federal court. \n \n The monks won round one in July, when U.S. District Judge Stanwood R. Duval Jr. ruled Louisiana\u2019s restrictions unconstitutional, saying \u201cthe sole reason for these laws is the economic protection of the funeral industry.\u201d \n \n The Louisiana State Board of Embalmers and Funeral Directors, which has argued that the law protects consumers, has appealed, and the circuit court in New Orleans will hear the case in early June. \n \n The monks are represented by the Arlington County-based Institute for Justice, which has a knack for picking empathetic, working-class parties \u2014 hair braiders, flower arrangers, city tour guides \u2014 to personify what it says is its battle against government regulation that strangles free enterprise. \n \n The group is on a constant watch to find the perfect case to challenge a series of economic regulation decisions nearly unbroken since the New Deal. Courts must find only that there is a \u201crational basis\u201d for an act, the most accommodating standard for government action. \n \n William H. \u201cChip\u201d Mellor, president of the group, said there are three essential components to a successful suit: \u201coutrageous facts,\u201d \u201cevil villains\u201d and \u201csympathetic clients.\u201d \n \n By that measure, the institute might find it hard to top St. Joseph Abbey.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A group of monks in Louisiana is heading to federal appeals court in a battle against the state.

The monks were victorious their first time in federal court, but the State Board of Embalmers and Funeral Directors appealed, and the next round will be heard early next month. St. Joseph Abbey, located an hour's drive outside of New Orleans, entered the casket business in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina destroyed an income-generating section of forest owned by the monastery. Before they even sold their first coffin, the state ordered they either stop or take the obstacle-filled path of becoming a licensed funeral establishment.

Matt Rose / The Times-Picayune / Landov ID: 5874049 \n \n By the time Officer Jason Lewis of the New Orleans Police Department returned to his police SUV, his K-9 \u2014 a six-year-old Belgian Malinois named Primo \u2014 was battling for his life. While Lewis got ready for his shift, he had left the dog inside the police vehicle. As the temperature inside the SUV rose on that hot May day in 2009, Primo tore, clawed, and bit into the upholstery on the seats \u2014 apparently trying to escape to cooler air. His body temperature spiked far above normal for a dog, to almost 110 degrees. When Lewis returned to the vehicle he saw Primo \u201clying in the back coughing.\u201d The officer hosed down the dog then rushed him to a local veterinary clinic, where the dog subsequently collapsed, suffered three seizures, and died. Cause of death: \u201cshock due to heat stress.\u201d ID: 5876273 \n \n Interior of the police SUV after the officer found Primo \u201clying in the back coughing.\u201d Metropolitan Crime Commission ID: 5874081 \n \n Primo is one of more than two dozen police K-9s that were left in vehicles and have died of heat-related symptoms since 2007. The animal rights group PETA identified 20 deaths; BuzzFeed News confirmed those and found another nine, based on local and national news reports. Untold numbers of pets die because they are left in cars, but the deaths of police dogs can be particularly heartrending because they, like uniformed officers, put their lives on the line. And these dogs don\u2019t need to die. New technology can warn handlers who\u2019ve left their K-9s in cars. \u201cIt is a painful, horrible death,\u201d said Justine Lee, a veterinary specialist in emergency critical care and toxicology for nearly 20 years. \u201cOnce a dog\u2019s temperature goes above 105 or 106 degrees, their cells start dying, and they can start going into seizures or have mass organ failure.\u201d With the exception of their paws, dogs lack the sweat glands that humans have on their skin. The main way dogs cool themselves is panting. Lee said that since police dogs are usually German shepherds or Belgian Malinois, with thicker coats and darker hair, they are more susceptible to heat stroke than other breeds. Ike, a Department of Corrections K-9 in Phoenix, died last year after being left in the back of a police vehicle for seven hours after an officer forgot about him. Two police K-9s \u2014 Vegas and Hades \u2014 perished after they were left in a police vehicle for nearly 30 hours in Bexar County, Texas, in 2012. Again, their officer said he forgot he left them in the kennel portion of the specially equipped police vehicle. (A spokesperson for the Arizona Department of Corrections said that the department installed \u201ca motion-sensing alarm system to help prevent similar accidents from occurring,\u201d while a spokesperson for the Bexar County Sheriff\u2019s Office said it had initiated \u201cextra measures to help ensure incidents like this don\u2019t happen again.\u201d) The vast majority of such K-9 deaths occur in local police forces, but dogs also sweltered to death while in vehicles belonging to airport police, corrections departments, and other types of law enforcement agencies. Forgetting the dog in the car is one problem, but some handlers intentionally put their dog in the vehicle, mistakenly trusting the air-conditioning system to keep running for hours. In a particularly ghastly case, police K-9 Sasha was found in her handler\u2019s SUV after three hot August days in Warwick, Georgia. Lt. T.J. Frye, Sasha\u2019s K-9 handler, told investigators the dog must have made it into the vehicle on her own, according to a local Atlanta TV station WSB. Sasha\u2019s final moments in the car were eerily similar to Primo\u2019s. Both dogs apparently tried to chew through the car to escape. After Frye found Sasha\u2019s bloated and decomposing body in the vehicle, he buried the eight-year-old Dutch shepherd in his backyard. Local residents and city officials expressed shock and grief, demanding that the dog receive a proper burial. An online petition for an investigation into the dog\u2019s death received more than 4,000 signatures. Officer Frye resigned from the force a week after the dog\u2019s death. The Warwick Police Department referred comment to its lawyer, Tommy Coleman, who said the department has \u201ctried to put in place procedures\u201d to prevent such deaths. \u201cWhen you have public \u200bofficers who serve in the capacity of, basically, a trustee of the public, and they cause the death of an animal who had been charged with serving the same community, most people get really charged,\u201d said Scott Heiser, director of the Criminal Justice Program at the Animal Legal Defense Fund. \u201cThese dogs are a voiceless class, much like kids, and they are at that compete mercy of their handlers\u200b.\u201d Across America, there are at least 20,000 working police dogs, said Rick Ashabranner, president of the North American Police Work Dog Association. \u201cProbably 95% of dogs stay with their handler and their family,\u201d said Ashabranner, who worked with a police narcotics dog for 22 years. \u201cIt\u2019s no different than owning a pet. The bond is so tight that when they die it\u2019s like losing a family member.\u201d No one knows how many police dogs die annually in hot cars. No federal agency keeps track. The Connecticut Police Work Dog Association tallies K-9s that died in service from all causes. The organization has tallied more than 2,000 K-9 deaths since 1940 from agencies including the Navy, Border Patrol, and local police. K-9s who died of excessive heat because they were left in vehicles are not listed explicitly, but some of those deaths can be found on the website under the category of \u201cHeat Exhaustion.\u201d The 29 deaths confirmed by BuzzFeed News occurred in 14 states from North Carolina to California, and only between April and September. Even on mild summer days, closed vehicles act like a greenhouse. When it\u2019s 85 degrees outside, one study found that in 20 minutes, the temperature inside a car can rise almost to 114\u00b0F \u2014 almost 30 degrees. After an hour, the inside temperature can hit a scorching 128 degrees. ID: 5876279 \n \n This is how quickly a car can heat up Courtesy Jan Null, CCM; Department of Meteorology and Climate Science, San Jose State University ID: 5874202 \n \n According to historical temperature data, New Orleans hit a high of 88 degrees on May 27, 2009, the day Primo died. In an hour, according to the study, the black-haired dog would have been in temperatures nearing 130 degrees. By comparison, the hottest temperature ever recorded in the United States was 134 degrees in Death Valley, California. Officer Lewis told investigators that he had left the air conditioner on in the vehicle when he left Primo, according to a story in the Times-Picayune. A subsequent police investigation found no wrongdoing, but the district attorney charged Officer Lewis with aggravated cruelty to animals, a felony. Lewis later pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor animal cruelty charge. He was ordered to pay $11,500 to the police department. After almost three years, a court of appeals found that Lewis was not negligent, and reinstated the officer with full pay and benefits. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge controversy that he got off,\u201d said Jeff Dorson, the executive director of the Humane Society of Louisiana. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know the truth, but the evidence shows that the dog did die of heat exhaustion, according to the necropsy report. And the fact that he [Lewis] plead guilty originally, what does that tell you?\u201d A spokesman for the NOPD confirmed to BuzzFeed News that Lewis was reinstated to the force but no longer works with a K-9 Unit. The NOPD declined a request to interview Lewis. A 2012 federal consent decree mandated 15 specific changes to how the NOPD handles its K-9s, including \u201cimprovements to handler control of canines, personnel changes, and equipment procedures.\u201d \u201cBy working in conjunction with the federal consent decree monitor, NOPD has put new and more stringent policies, training and procedures in place for both the dogs and their handlers,\u201d said the department in response to questions by BuzzFeed News. The deaths of Primo, Hades, Vegas, Sasha, and other dogs were preventable. Many police K-9 units use heat alert systems sometimes known as \u201cHot Dog\u201d or \u201cHot-N-Pop\u201d systems. The technology varies, but if the vehicle\u2019s interior gets too hot, the alert system automatically rolls down the windows, activates a cooling system or fan, and sets off the vehicle\u2019s siren. According to an investigation by San Antonio\u2019s ABC affiliate, KSAT 12, the Bextar County Sheriff\u2019s Office bought two Hot Dog systems prior to the death of police K-9s Hades and Vegas, but \u201csat in boxes, untouched on a training room floor for over a year.\u201d It is unclear why the systems, which were bought from a $27,000 grant, were not installed, the article states. A spokesman for the Bextar County Sheriff\u2019s Office emailed BuzzFeed News that Hades and Vegas died \u201cduring a previous administration\u201d and that the department has since taken new measures to prevent such deaths. He also wrote that \u201ck9s are considered partners and the loss of them is tremendous for those who interact with them.\u201d Since 2010, the NOPD has installed Hot-N-Pop systems inside every vehicle in the department, according to the NOPD\u2019s statement to BuzzFeed News. \u201cI\u2019ve had those systems installed; I know how well they work,\u201d said Jason Purgason, a former K-9 supervisor with the Reidsville Police Department in North Carolina for 10 years. A Hot Dog system typically costs $500\u2013$1,000 per vehicle. \u201cIn the grand scheme of things, those systems are inexpensive,\u201d said Purgason, now a training director for Highland Canine Training in North Carolina. The cost of procuring a police K-9 can vary greatly, but is generally expensive. The Glendale Police Department in Los Angeles County puts the figure around $20,000. The purchase of a dog alone is around $8,000. The additional cost of training of the dog for patrol, detection, and tracking is another $12,000. Total costs including outfitting a vehicle designed to carry a K-9 easily surpass $50,000 \u2014 and that figure does not include yearly training maintenance, veterinary care, and food. PETA plans to send letters to K-9 law enforcement organizations around the country urging them to install Hot Dog systems in all vehicles. \u201cNo dog should endure a needless, agonizing death while locked in a hot car, and a heat-alert system would be an easy fix,\u201d the statement reads. The beginnings of the modern police dog can be found with the establishment of the first formal police dog training program in Belgium in 1899. Today, K-9s help track fugitive and missing persons, and they detect narcotics and explosives. Last September, as summer was drawing to a close in Montville Township, Ohio, two-year-old Beny was left in a patrol vehicle for more than fours hours, the windows rolled up, while Sgt. Brett Harrison filled out paperwork inside the police station, according to a local report. After Beny\u2019s death, Sgt. Harrison wrote an apology to the township trustees. \u201cMost of all, I want to say I\u2019m sorry to my partner, friend and loving family member Beny. I wish everyday that I could go back and change that day or that I could put myself in your place. You will always be in my heart and I will miss you every second of every day,\u201d Harrison wrote. Sgt. Harrison was given a two-week unpaid suspension, and 40 hours of his vacation time were taken away. Harrison was found guilty of one count of companion animal cruelty in March. Sgt. Harrison and the Montville Police Department did not respond to requests to comment. ID: 5876324 \n \n Police K-9 Beny. Montville Township Police ID: 5874118",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A BuzzFeed investigation this year found at least 29 US police dogs had died of heatstroke in their handlers' cars over the past seven years. But a new analysis of 619 deaths since 2011 by the Green Bay Press-Gazette raises that number to at least 46 dogs, with 18 others succumbing to heatstroke during other activities (e.g., training exercises, being tethered outside in the sun), putting heatstroke as the No. 1 cause of police dog deaths for non-medical reasons. Failures in the cars' AC or other equipment were factors in 19 of the 46 cases, while officer negligence was blamed in 26. One especially egregious case in 2013 involved 10 US Customs and Border Protection dogs who died after the AC failed. \"Those dogs were essentially in an oven,\" a rep said at the time. \"You don't have to be an animal lover to be sick about this.\" It's unclear exactly how many police dogs die this way, since agencies don't have to report it, the Press-Gazette notes; instead, stats are typically culled from memorial websites and other sources. \"It is a painful, horrible death,\" a veterinary specialist told BuzzFeed. Departments are taking measures including replacing faulty heat-alarm units, mounting fans in car windows, and inspecting AC units more regularly. But advocates say it comes down to human diligence. \"It's not a matter of changing policy,\" the director of a Wisconsin canine handler group tells the Press-Gazette. \"Check on your dog.\" An Animal Legal Defense Fund director puts it in harsher terms: \"An officer who allows a dog to die of heat exhaustion on duty is as neglectful as leaving a service revolver on a school playground.\" (A Florida officer was \"distraught\" after two police dogs died in his car.)",

The vast majority of such K-9 deaths occur in local police forces, but dogs also sweltered to death while in vehicles belonging to airport police departments, corrections departments, other types of agencies. Untold numbers of pets die because they are left in cars, but the deaths of police dogs can be particularly heartrending because they, like uniformed officers, put their lives on the line.

    "document": "\"Ending the sale of cigarettes and tobacco products at CVS/pharmacy is the right thing for us to do for our customers and our company to help people on their path to better health,\" said Larry J. Merlo, President and CEO, CVS Caremark. \"Put simply, the sale of tobacco products is inconsistent with our purpose.\" \n \n Merlo continued, \"As the delivery of health care evolves with an emphasis on better health outcomes, reducing chronic disease and controlling costs, CVS Caremark is playing an expanded role in providing care through our pharmacists and nurse practitioners. The significant action we're taking today by removing tobacco products from our retail shelves further distinguishes us in how we are serving our patients, clients and health care providers and better positions us for continued growth in the evolving health care marketplace.\" \n \n Smoking is the leading cause of premature disease and death in the United States with more than 480,000 deaths annually. While the prevalence of cigarette smoking has decreased from approximately 42 percent of adults in 1965 to 18 percent today, the rate of reduction in smoking prevalence has stalled in the past decade. More interventions, such as reducing the availability of cigarettes, are needed. \n \n \"CVS Caremark is continually looking for ways to promote health and reduce the burden of disease,\" said CVS Caremark Chief Medical Officer Troyen A. Brennan, M.D., M.P.H. \"Stopping the sale of cigarettes and tobacco will make a significant difference in reducing the chronic illnesses associated with tobacco use.\" \n \n In a Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Viewpoint published online this morning, Brennan and co-author Steven A. Schroeder, Director, Smoking Cessation Leadership Center, University of California, San Francisco, wrote, \"The paradox of cigarette sales in pharmacies has become even more relevant recently, in large part because of changes in the pharmacy industry\u2026Most pharmacy chains are retooling themselves as an integral part of the health care system. They are offering more counseling by pharmacists, an array of wellness products and outreach to clinicians and health care centers\u2026.Perhaps more important, pharmacies are moving into the treatment arena, with the advent of retail health clinics. These retail clinics, originally designed to address common acute infections, are gearing up to work with primary care clinicians to assist in treating hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes \u2013 all conditions exacerbated by smoking.\" \n \n CVS Caremark's decision to stop selling tobacco products is consistent with the positions taken by the American Medical Association, American Heart Association, American Cancer Society, American Lung Association and American Pharmacists Association that have all publicly opposed tobacco sales in retail outlets with pharmacies. \n \n \"As a leader of the health care community focused on improving health outcomes, we are pledging to help millions of Americans quit smoking,\" said Merlo. \"In addition to removing cigarettes and tobacco products for sale, we will undertake a robust national smoking cessation program.\" \n \n The program, to be launched this Spring, is expected to include information and treatment on smoking cessation at CVS/pharmacy and MinuteClinic along with online resources. The program will be available broadly across all CVS/pharmacy and MinuteClinic locations and will offer additional comprehensive programs for CVS Caremark pharmacy benefit management plan members to help them to quit smoking. Approximately seven in ten smokers say they want to quit and about half attempt to quit each year. \n \n \"Every day, all across the country, customers and patients place their trust in our 26,000 pharmacists and nurse practitioners to serve their health care needs,\" commented Helena B. Foulkes, President, CVS/pharmacy. \"Removing tobacco products from our stores is an important step in helping Americans to quit smoking and get healthy.\" \n \n The decision to exit the tobacco category does not affect the company's 2014 segment operating profit guidance, 2014 EPS guidance, or the company's five-year financial projections provided at its December 18th Analyst Day. The company estimates that it will lose approximately $2 billion in revenues on an annual basis from the tobacco shopper, equating to approximately 17 cents per share. Given the anticipated timing for implementation of this change, the impact to 2014 earnings per share is expected to be in the range of 6 to 9 cents per share. The company has identified incremental opportunities that are expected to offset the profitability impact. This decision more closely aligns the company with its patients, clients and health care providers to improve health outcomes while controlling costs and positions the company for continued growth. \n \n About CVS Caremark \n \n CVS Caremark is dedicated to helping people on their path to better health as the largest integrated pharmacy company in the United States. Through the company's more than 7,600 CVS/pharmacy stores; its leading pharmacy benefit manager serving more than 60 million plan members; and its retail health clinic system, the largest in the nation with more than 800 MinuteClinic locations, it is a market leader in mail order, retail and specialty pharmacy, retail clinics, and Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plans.

It is the first time any drugstore has ever dropped this deadly cash cow, and it is part of a major shift in direction for the drugstore giant. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019ve got 26,000 pharmacists and nurse practitioners who are helping millions of patients each and every day,\u201d said Larry Merlo, the chief executive of CVS Caremark. \u201cThey manage conditions like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes -- all conditions that are worsened by smoking. We\u2019ve come to the decision that cigarettes have no place in an environment where healthcare is being delivered.\u201d \n \n The decision gained immediate praise from the American Medical Association, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the American Cancer Society . \u201cOver time, we think lives will be saved by this,\u201d says Cancer Society President John Seffrin. But the public-health-mindedness will cost CVS billions \u2013 literally. The company says $2 billion in sales will be shaved off its $125 billion top line. That will pressure earnings, too, though Merlo swears incremental cost cuts will keep those pressures from showing up in its profit statements. \n \n Merlo says that continuing to sell cigarettes, which the Surgeon General blames for 480,000 deaths every year from heart disease, lung cancer, and stroke, was anathema to CVS\u2019 long-term plan to become a central player in the U.S. health care system that interacts ever more closely with patients, giving flu shots, reminding them when they are not filling prescriptions, and, through its 800 Minute Clinic in-store nurse practitioner stations, prescribing medicines. \u201cI see my role as insuring that the company is positioned for growth,\u201d says Merlo. \u201cAnd that is what this decision is about.\u201d \n \n CVS, like rivals Walgreen and Rite-Aid Corporation, is seeing a dramatic change to its business as it focuses less on taking marginal revenue out of drug sales and more on larger agreements with hospitals and insurance companies. In fact, CVS is in the midst of an even bigger shift than its competitors. Because of its 2007 merger with Caremark, the company is not only a drug store chain but also a pharmacy benefit manager, meaning it works with insurance companies and employers to control drug costs. The assumption is that by being a rival to both Rite-Aid and benefits manager Express Scripts , CVS can extract better savings and offer better care to patients, saving employers money both by cutting costs and by making people healthier. \n \n Among CVS\u2019 newer offerings: a deal with insurers through which patients who have not filled a needed prescription, like a hypertension drug, are given counseling from a pharmacist if they show up wanting something else, like an antibiotic. This is possible because CVS has records of both in-store and mail-order prescriptions; unfilled prescriptions cost the medical system $300 billion annually, CVS says. Another new product will help patients sign up for expensive drugs for cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and other \u201cspecialty\u201d conditions, help them figure out how to pay for them, and allow them to either get them in the mail or pick them up at a CVS story. \n \n These new efforts have led CVS to work more closely with hospitals, doctors\u2019 networks, and what are called Accountable Care Organizations, new types of organizations encouraged by Obamacare in which doctors agree to be paid not for every stitch, prescription, or procedure but based on how well patients do after treatment. If CVS can help save money or keep patients healthier, it might get a piece of the action. But these efforts were leading to cognitive dissonance, says Troyen Brennan, a former professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who is now CVS\u2019 chief medical officer. \n \n \u201cWe would always get the question: why do you continue to sell cigarettes?\u201d says Brennan. \u201cBecause from the physicians\u2019 and nurses\u2019 point of view, you\u2019re either all in for healthcare or you\u2019re not.\u201d He says he thinks that having been the first pharmacy to drop cigarettes will be a \u201ccompetitive advantage\u201d against other retail pharmacies because of the credibility it will give CVS when talking to physicians. \n \n It\u2019s certainly getting good buzz from organizations pre-briefed on the announcement. Risa Lavizzo-Mourey, MD, the CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, called CVS\u2019 cig ban \u201ca huge and important step forward for moving us as a nation to a place where we can be healthier.\u201d And Robin Koval, the chief executive of Legacy, the foundation formed to stop teen smoking formed when 46 states\u2019 attorneys general settled with tobacco makers, literally said \u201cWow.\u201d \n \n \u201cFor the number one retail pharmacy chain to take a very bold step like this and put people and their health in front of profits sends a signal that if you want to talk the talk about being there to serve your customers and their healthcare needs, then you have to walk the walk,\u201d says Koval. \n \n In the shorter term, the cigarette ban may help with one new business: CVS is offering patients\u2019 smoking cessation therapy, which will usually be paid for by insurance but which some patients will need to pay for out of pocket. Patients will be offered several counseling sessions with a nurse practitioner and perhaps, if they need them, nicotine replacement gums, lozenges, or patches or medicines like Chantix and Zyban that can help patients quit. CVS does not sell so-called e-cigarettes, which vaporize nicotine so it can be inhaled. \n \n Will the halo from the public health praise be enough to make up for the hit to earnings? Maybe. The $2 billion in annual sales lost is only 1.6% of total revenue. In turn, CVS says that this will pressure earnings by 17 cents per share, or 40%, on an annual basis. But because the removal won\u2019t have fully happened until October, that will only hit this year\u2019s earnings by 6 to 9 cents per share. And CVS says it can make up those costs, maintaining its guidance, although that earnings coverage has to come from somewhere. The company is making a bold bet on rebranding itself as being not just a store, but a healthcare company. Arguably, it\u2019s not there yet. But Merlo has established a clear sense of direction, and when it comes to a big, often slow-moving company, that is a good thing. \n \n Also on Forbes: ||||| President Obama, an ex-smoker, released this statement applauding CVs for stopping the sale of cigarettes and tobacco products: \n \n \"I applaud this morning\u2019s news that CVS Caremark has decided to stop selling cigarettes and other tobacco products in its stores, and begin a national campaign to help millions of Americans quit smoking instead. As one of the largest retailers and pharmacies in America, CVS Caremark sets a powerful example, and today\u2019s decision will help advance my Administration\u2019s efforts to reduce tobacco-related deaths, cancer, and heart disease, as well as bring down health care costs \u2013 ultimately saving lives and protecting untold numbers of families from pain and heartbreak for years to come. I congratulate \u2013 and thank \u2013 the CEO of CVS Caremark, Larry Merlo, the board of directors, and all who helped make a choice that will have a profoundly positive impact on the health of our country.\" \n \n The Washington Post reports on the big move by CVS:",

So Hogeg, CEO of the photo and video sharing service Mobli, asked Or Arbel, a former iOS designer at the company, to create a solution. \n \n What Hogeg wanted, as Arbel recalls, was an app that had \"one big button and when I tap it, it sends her a notification and she knows that I need her.\" Arbel's response was less than enthusiastic at first: \"I told him it will take me two hours to do it, but I\u2019m not going to do it, because it's a silly idea.\" \n \n Arbel was wrong about two things: He did end up doing it. And it took him eight hours to build the initial version, not two. \n \n The result was Yo, an app that lets users say \"yo\" to their contacts. If you're feeling particularly chatty, you can double tap a contact's name to say \"YoYo.\" Those are the only ways to communicate within the app. \n \n The free app launched quietly in April, but received some mainstream attention on Wednesday after the Financial Times wrote it up. The idea of an app dedicated to simply saying \"yo\" would likely have been easy enough to poke fun at, but the article noted that investors had contributed $1 million toward the app. That detail lit a fire on Twitter. \n \n Hopefully Yo will learn from Instagrm, and hold out. RT @jyarow: Facebook should buy Yo for $2 billion. \u2014 Joseph Weisenthal (@TheStalwart) June 18, 2014 \n \n I honestly can\u2019t tell if this is a joke or not http://t.co/HfANMjrwWp \u2014 Matt O'Brien (@ObsoleteDogma) June 18, 2014 \n \n facebook devs start working on an app called 'hey' in 3...2... \u2014 \u25b5 Jenna Wortham \u25b5 (@jennydeluxe) June 18, 2014 \n \n New app idea: Like Yo, but not stupid \u2014 delrayser (@delrayser) June 18, 2014 \n \n After initially greeting me on the phone \u2014 yes, he said \"yo\" \u2014 Arbel quickly launched into an explanation of what he believed these and other commenters were missing. \n \n \"People don\u2019t get it. They think that it's just an app that says 'Yo,'\" he told Mashable. \"What we see is a whole new way to get notifications \u2014 life notifications \u2014 from friends, family...\" \n \n One use case, he says, is that people can add \"WorldCup\" on Yo and receive a \"yo\" every time a goal is scored in a soccer match. Another use case his team is working on is adding a Yo button that can be embedded on blogs and be used to notify readers \u2014 with a message from the blog reading \"yo\" \u2014 that a new story has published. \n \n According to Arbel, \"one guy\" uses the app to show his girlfriend that he's thinking of her throughout the day. \"His girlfriend is always complaining that he doesn't text her during the day,\" Arbel explains. Upon further questioning, that user turned out to be Hogeg, the Mobli CEO who pushed for the idea in the first place. \n \n \"If you think this is just an app that says 'Yo,' you are getting it wrong,\" he says. \"It's a new way to get lightweight, non-intrusive notifications. We are here to cut through the noise. We like to call it context-based messaging.\" \n \n In short, it's like a cross between Facebook's original Poke button, Foursquare's new Swarm app, an RSS reader and WhatsApp without so many words. \n \n We could probably write something about how this app somehow epitomizes the trend toward frictionless communication, or scoff at the idea of investors throwing money at any app that somehow fits into the social/mobile category. Or we could just point out the irony that an app which lets you send a two-letter word over and over is somehow getting more buzz today than Facebook's new messaging app, Slingshot. \n \n But for now, we'll just say \"yo.\" \n \n You can download the app on iOS and Android. ||||| Photo \n \n Some technology start-ups want to cure the world\u2019s ills. Others want to disrupt major industries. One app has a strategy that amounts to a single word. \n \n Yo. \n \n The app, called Yo, lets people say \u201cYo\u201d to their friends. Tap a name on the app\u2019s list of contacts, and a text notification saying \u201cYo\u201d pops up on the recipient\u2019s smartphone, along with a recorded voice shouting the syllable. \n \n The idea is simple. It may turn out to be a dud. But $1 million has already been staked on its success. \n \n Or Arbel, the chief executive of Yo, said on Wednesday that he had raised that seven-figure sum from a group of angel investors led by Moshe Hogeg, the chief executive of an image-sharing app called Mobli. Yo has so much potential, Mr. Arbel said, that last week he left his job as the chief technology officer of Stox, a stock trading platform he helped start last year, and moved to San Francisco from Tel Aviv to work on Yo full-time. \n \n \u201cPeople think it\u2019s just an app that says \u2018Yo.\u2019 But it\u2019s really not,\u201d Mr. Arbel said. \u201cWe like to call it context-based messaging. You understand by the context what is being said.\u201d \n \n Mr. Arbel has big plans for Yo. One possible use, he said, would be for newspapers and blogs to send Yo\u2019s to subscribers (rather, to Yo them) when a new article is published. \n \n Already, Yo is piggybacking on the mania for the World Cup. Anyone who sends a Yo to \u201cWORLDCUP\u201d will get Yo notifications whenever a goal is scored. How does the company do it? Simple: One of its four part-time employees is responsible for watching every World Cup game. \n \n Mr. Arbel insists that this is useful information. The Yo, he said, can prompt people to look at a nearby screen to check out the action. \n \n The simplicity is the whole point. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a lightweight, nonintrusive way to communicate with your friends and family and also things that interest you,\u201d Mr. Arbel said. \n \n The idea came from Mr. Hogeg, who asked Mr. Arbel a few months ago to create an app whose sole purpose would be to notify Mr. Hogeg\u2019s personal assistant when Mr. Hogeg wanted to see her in his office. Mr. Arbel figured it would be easy enough to build, but said he didn\u2019t have time. \n \n Mr. Hogeg was persistent. But Mr. Arbel dismissed the idea. \u201cI said, \u2018No, it\u2019s really stupid. Other people can\u2019t use it. How many people in the world have a personal assistant?\u2019 \u201d \n \n \u201cThen, a day later, I thought about this app,\u201d Mr. Arbel said. \u201cAnd I remembered that I have a friend in L.A., and he and I communicate with text messages that mean nothing.\u201d \n \n \u201cAnd then it hit me,\u201d he said. \n \n After eight hours of work, Yo was born. It debuted on Apple\u2019s app store in April. Mr. Arbel estimated that almost four million Yo\u2019s have been sent to date. \n \n A Yo can mean different things. Mr. Arbel said he would send a Yo to a business partner to signify \u201cgood morning.\u201d \n \n It can also have a more personal connotation. Mr. Arbel recalled that Mr. Hogeg\u2019s wife once complained that her husband wasn\u2019t texting her enough to say \u201cI love you.\u201d \n \n \u201cHe started Yo-ing her in the middle in the day, and then she knows he\u2019s thinking about her,\u201d Mr. Arbel said. \u201cSo she doesn\u2019t bother him any more.\u201d \n \n The financing round was reported earlier by The Financial Times. \n \n Among the technophiles and journalists, Yo was, at least momentarily, a phenomenon on Twitter. \n \n There were also some questions, with a hint of frustration. \n \n why is my timeline full of yo \u2014 Jared Keller (@jaredbkeller) 18 Jun 14 \n \n What are you turkeys talking about today?

To many, it seems like a joke. But its inventor, Or Arbel, is totally serious. \n \n Arbel, who built the app three months ago, has quit his job and moved halfway around the world \u2014 from his native Israel to San Francisco \u2014 to work on Yo full time. He\u2019s opening an office, hiring staff and seeking \u201cstrategic partners.\u201d And oh yeah: He\u2019s already raised $1 million from investors. \n \n So is Arbel right?

Or is investor interest in Yo an unmistakable sign that we are in the midst of another internet bubble? \n \n \u201cthe way it affects your life is profound\u201d \n \n Yo is a very simple app. It allows you to send a push notification to anyone else with the app. All of those notifications say the same thing: \u201cYo.\u201d Arbel says that \u201cyou usually understand what the Yo means based on who you get it from and when you get it.\u201d According to Arbel, once you start using Yo \u201cthe way it affects your life is profound.\u201d He noted that many of the reviews of Yo in the app store say things like \u201cYo changed my life.\u201d \n \n Some of these reviews, however, do seem a bit sarcastic: \u201cNot just a means of simple but effective communication, Yo is a way of life,\u201d one review says. \u201cSince downloading Yo, all my relationships have improved and I\u2019ve regrown most of my hair.\u201d \n \n Yo was launched in the App Store on April Fool\u2019s Day of this year. (It was initially rejected by Apple because they thought the App wasn\u2019t finished yet.) It took off when tech evangelist Robert Scoble called it \u201cthe stupidest but most addicting app ever.\u201d Thus far, it has attracted over 50,000 users who have sent about 4 million Yos. It\u2019s particularly popular among other start-ups like Kickstarter and Four Square. Once it gets into an office, Arbel says, \u201cit goes viral.\u201d \n \n Why not just send the word \u201cYo\u201d using an existing messaging app? Arbel says the primary benefit is efficiency. With WhatsApp, an extremely popular messaging app that allows you to send words of your choosing, it takes 11 taps to send a Yo. With the Yo app, it only takes two taps. \n \n The comparison to WhatsApp also may point to Arbel\u2019s larger strategy. In February, Facebook acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion, even though the company\u2019s revenue is negligible. Arbel says that anyone who uses WhatsApp will also want Yo. If Arbel can grow Yo into something a larger company believes is even 1 percent as valuable as WhatsApp, that\u2019s still $190 million. \n \n Some analysts believe the WhatsApp sale and the flood of venture capital seeking out the next big thing represents a new tech bubble. Hedge fund manager David Einhorn, speaking to the Los Angeles Times recently, said \u201c[t]here is a clear consensus that we are witnessing our second tech bubble in 15 years. What is uncertain is how much further the bubble can expand, and what might pop it.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe do have some users who don\u2019t get it and think it\u2019s a joke\u201d \n \n During the last tech bubble, in 2000, the Nasdaq Index \u2014 which features many technology stocks \u2014 lost nearly 80 percent of its value and \u201cSilicon Valley saw 200,000 jobs evaporate overnight.\u201d In the first quarter of 2014 \u201cventure capitalists invested $9.5 billion in 951 U.S. companies,\u201d a level not seen since the last bust. \n \n Many people within the tech industry, however, remain bullish. The internet is much more mature than at the turn of the century, the smartphone plays a central role in modern life, and people much more willing to spend money to enhance their online experience. \n \n So how do you convince investors that there is money to be made in the Yo-delivery business? Arbel is working on developing an API that will allow him to \u201cpartner with brands.\u201d In our Yo-enhanced future you would get Yos from \u201cthings that interest you.\u201d When the Gap has a sale, for example, it would send you a Yo. When your friend\u2019s plane lands, Delta will send you a Yo. Arbel is particularly excited about the prospect of getting a Yo into Starbucks. When your order is ready, Starbucks could send you a Yo. \n \n \u201cShouting your name is old fashioned,\u201d he says. \n \n The first $1 million has come from group of investors associated with Moshe Hogeg, the CEO a social network similar to Instagram, Mobli, where Arbel worked for two years. (He initially created the app at the request of Hogeg, who wanted an easy want to tell his personal assistant he needed to talk to her.) Arbel said he\u2019d like to raise some more money from \u201cstrategic partners.\u201d \n \n One thing that Arbel won\u2019t be doing is adding more features. He believes that simplicity is the key to its success. (There are some hidden features, or \u201cEaster eggs,\u201d in the app. You can double tap someone\u2019s name to send a \u201cYoYo.\u201d And adding a plus sign between usernames sends Yos to a group.) The simplicity also provides some benefits to users. Unlike most other messaging apps, Yo doesn\u2019t collect any personal information from users. In comparison to photo messaging apps like SnapChat, it\u2019s hard for kids to get into trouble using Yo. You cannot sext on it. \n \n \u201cWe do have some users who don\u2019t get it and think it\u2019s a joke,\u201d Arbel admits. He thinks that even if users initially download the app because they think its funny, they\u2019ll keep using it because it will \u201cchange their everyday life.\u201d He describes the perception of Yo as a joke as a \u201cproblem we need to solve.\u201d \n \n The larger problem is whether an economy built on seven-figure investments in Apps like Yo is sustainable. If Arbel can convince sophisticated investors that Yo already merits a $1 million investment, maybe he is onto something. Or maybe the potential of Yo is not in the product itself, but on the ability in a frenzied marketplace to quickly flip Yo to another company for a profit and move onto the next app. It was too many of those kinds of transactions \u2014 divorced from revenue or value of the consumer \u2014 that caused the entire system to crash at the turn of the century. \n \n Where does Yo fit into this equation? We\u2019ll need to wait and see. Until then, Arbel has been waiting for a Yo when this piece gets published.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Have you been Yo'd yet? If the question makes no sense, you've missed the buzz around a new app called Yo that allows people to send a message of \"Yo\" to their friends. That's it. (Unless you double-tap the name and make it \"YoYo.\" Before laughing it off, note that the creators are dead serious about its potential and have already raised $1 million from investors led by Mobli CEO Moshe Hogeg, as the Financial Times reported in the story that set off a flurry of coverage. Inventor Or Arbel tells ThinkProgress that the promise of Yo centers around what he calls \"context-based communications.\" Users generally understand what the Yo means based on who sends it and when it arrives. (Yeah, the app is drawing its fair share of ridicule.) \"People don\u2019t get it,\" Arbel tells Mashable. \"They think that it's just an app that says 'Yo.' What we see is a whole new way to get notifications\u2014life notifications\u2014from friends, family.\" Or from businesses: Arbel floats the idea of Starbucks customers getting a Yo when their drink is ready. And the New York Times notes that users can get a Yo every time a goal is scored in the World Cup\u2014thanks to a part-time employee who is charged with watching every game. All the stories relay the genesis of the idea: Hogeg asked Arbel for a simple app that would allow him to summon his personal assistant with the press of a button. After eight hours of work, Yo was born.",

To quote one of Forrest's truest pieces of wisdom: Maybe both is happening at the same time. ||||| The festival of green screen that is \"Bitch Slap\" is surely intended to be a fond tribute to any number of hot-women-in-peril movies. Think Zack Snyder meets Roger Corman. Meets Christopher Nolan. Seriously. But when it offers only scant humor (and costumes) and interminable girl-fighting, isn't that actually just another entry in the genre?There is a plot, for those who look beyond the belles and whistling, but it has something to do with buried treasure and the CIA and other stuff like that, in a structure borrowed from \"Memento,\" so the less said, the better. This movie's raison d'\u00eatre bursts forth in close-up after close-up lovingly caressing the assets of its actresses. And they are appropriately cast as the three stupefyingly sexed-up conspirators/combatants/abrupt make-out session participants.There are moments of enjoyment -- the oh-so-gratuitous water fight, the lusty sadism of the most unhinged of the three, and did I mention the abrupt make-out session? There's plenty not to enjoy as well, including a surfeit of fistfights. The target audience must be that awfully precise niche that never tires of women punching each other. The film also suffers from the lack of Zo\u00eb Bell; it's the latest film to underuse the most memorable aspect of Quentin Tarantino's \"Death Proof\" -- flinch and you'll miss her, but she does coordinate the stunts.Despite its obsession with d\u00e9colletage, \"Bitch Slap\" is surprisingly puritanical (much teasing, no pleasing), substituting plentiful violence and a howlingly predictable \"shock\" ending for the payoff it promises.-- Michael Ordo\u00f1aMPAA rating: R for brutal violence, strong sexual content and language throughout, and brief drug use. Running time: 1 hour, 44 minutes. At the Landmark Nuart Theatre, West L.A.It can't be a good sign for a vampire movie when its most memorable trait is how desperate Chrysler's product placement appears.Sans teen angst or coifs, \"Daybreakers\" is set a decade after a vampire plague has swept the globe, the remaining human population no more than rapidly dwindling food stock. To grab life by the horns in the daytime, the well-heeled undead tool around in sunshield-bedecked Chryslers. Meanwhile, a crusading hematologist played by Ethan Hawke searches for a blood substitute to save the vampires from starvation -- and humans from extinction.Riding to the possible rescue in a modified muscle car is Willem Dafoe as a lapsed vampire whose re-humanizing could mean a cure, killing two bats with one stone. The corporate villains, led by Sam Neill, would rather cling to their upper-class status than address the problems. Hence, some chasing, some soul-searching, some excellent cranial explosions and spontaneous combustions (vampires apparently have hellacious allergies to splinters).\"Daybreakers\" may be harboring a message under the eruptions of gore: It depicts the exhaustion of resources by the powerful, who are even more addicted to profits and cars than blood. And the \"cure,\" for the curious, can be rephrased as a Louis Brandeis commonplace for speaking political truths. Any higher intentions are brought crashing down by predictability, wooden characters, giggle-inducing attempts at scares (shrieking bats, anyone?) and cinematography so gloomy it should be checked for serotonin deficiency.This isn't the film to relieve our collective vampire fatigue. But perhaps it's nothing a spin in a brand-new Chrysler couldn't cure.-- Michael Ordo\u00f1aMPAA rating: R for strong bloody violence, language and brief nudity. Running time: 1 hour, 38 minutes. In general release.What happened to Matthew Broderick? Maybe the question, and even its answer, is now obvious, but when and why did he go from the very picture of reedy, goofy, energetic youthfulness in films such as \"War Games\" and \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" to the puffy, downbeat and browbeaten exemplar of unhappiness and bitter ennui that he has been in pretty much everything since \"Election\"? Is adulthood that dreary? Is there something else we should know?In \"Wonderful World,\" Broderick plays Ben Singer, a once moderately successful performer of children's music who has retreated from the world, becoming a self-styled, self-hating curmudgeon. His ex-wife now lives in a huge mansion with her new husband, and Singer's teenage daughter rarely wants to see him. He works as a proofreader in a law office, making a long-term career of a job most people use as a temporary landing pad. His only solace comes from smoking pot and playing chess with his Senegalese roommate Ibou (Michael Kenneth Williams). When Ibou goes into a diabetic coma, Ben finds himself with a new roommate in Ibou's sister ( Sanaa Lathan).It's presumably just a quirk of timing that \"Wonderful World\" traffics in many of the same motions as 2007's \"The Visitor,\" both films using immigrants to open the eyes of closed-off main characters. Yet where \"The Visitor\" had at least a passing interest in the underlying political ramifications of its crossed-cultures story line, in \"Wonderful World\" the focus is strictly on the personal, in getting this Singer to sing again.Josh Goldin, a longtime screenwriter whose credits include \"Darkman\" and \"Out on a Limb\" -- and whose wife is a writer at the L.A. Times -- makes his debut as a writer-director with \"Wonderful World.\" The results of Goldin's dual efforts are promising but uneven. The story never fully blends the idea of Singer's rediscovery of his artistic voice -- and even something as simple as why he was a children's performer in the first place is never addressed -- with his personal renewal. Why can't he be a kids' singer onstage and a jerk offstage?Broderick's sad-sack misanthropy is often taken as a given -- one look at the guy and he seems miserable -- and so the film never quite explores the hidden corners of his character's psyche. In a brief scene in the backroom of a guitar shop, Broderick's character jams with musician Dan Zanes, genuine leader of the movement to make kids' music hip, and guitar legend James Burton, sideman for Elvis Presley, Gram Parsons and Elvis Costello.In those moments, there is a simple buoyancy, a lifting of burden, that the rest of the film never quite reclaims.-- Mark OlsenMPAA rating: R for language, some drug use and sexual content. Running time: 1 hour, 29 minutes. At the Laemmle Music Hall in Beverly Hills. ||||| Matthew Broderick Hides Behind Beard in Wonderful World \n \n Ben Singer (Matthew Broderick), once the third-biggest kids' musician in the country, is now the number-one grump of an unnamed city that's played by Shreveport, Louisiana, where writer-director Joshua Goldin's feature debut was shot, and which also doubles, later in the film, as Dakar, Senegal. More impoverished than the budget is Wonderful World's script, a shopworn tale of redemption in which the constantly outraged, pot-puffing misanthrope learns that \"magic is everywhere.\" Alienating his legal-proofreader co-workers and even his 11-year-old daughter, Sandra (Jodelle Ferland), with his bilious indignation, Ben softens in the company of his Senegalese roommate and chess partner, Ibu (Michael K. Williams), who soon exits the movie in a diabetic coma, though his work in the rehabilitation of Ben's soul will be quickly picked up by his sister, Khadi (Sanaa Lathan). It's heartbreaking to see Lathan, an underemployed actress whose talents were last put to good use in 2006's Something Else, in such a ridiculous, impossible role, falling into bed with repugnant Ben and teaching Sandra West African dance. And Broderick looks as if he wants to hide permanently behind his three-day growth.",
