    "document": "SALT LAKE CITY -- A sex offender parolee who killed a University of Utah student whom he briefly dated allegedly threatened to post compromising pictures of the couple online. Melvin Rowland, 37, demanded that Lauren McCluskey send him money to stop him from doing so, authorities said Thursday. \n \n Rowland, 37, had been lurking on campus for days trying to confront the woman who had broken up with him weeks earlier when she discovered his criminal background, university police chief Dale Brophy said. Rowland spent the hours before the fatal shooting Monday in McCluskey's dorm building socializing with her friends, university police chief Dale Brophy said. \n \n He later confronted the 21-year-old McCluskey in the parking lot, dragged her into a car and shot her multiple times in the back seat, Brophy said at a news conference. \n \n Rowland killed himself hours later in a church as police closed in. \n \n The killing of McCluskey, a track athlete at the school, came weeks after she broke off her month-long relationship with Rowland and filed a complaint with campus police alleging he had demanded money in exchange for not posting compromising pictures of the couple online. She had sent $1,000 to an account in hopes of preserving her reputation, Brophy said. \n \n Police were investigating the case as sexual extortion and knew Rowland was a sex offender but not that he was on parole, Brophy said. \n \n NEW in @UUtah student death \n \n Police say... \n \n -Lauren McCluskey paid Melvin Rowland $1000 to keep compromising photos private \n \n -He was on campus Fri to Mon, looking for McCluskey \n \n -He texted her, posing as cop Monday AM to lure her outside \n \n -He went on date (dinner, shower) after murder \u2014 Michael Locklear (@MichaelLocklear) October 25, 2018 \n \n McCluskey reported receiving numerous emails and messages using different names trying to lure her to locations. Investigators now believe they all came from Rowland, who Brophy called a master manipulator. \n \n After shooting McCluskey, Rowland was picked up on campus by a woman he met online. They went to dinner, visited the state Capitol and went to her apartment where Rowland took a shower. \n \n Later that night, after the woman dropped Rowland at a coffee shop, police tracked him to the church where he killed himself. \n \n The woman had called police when she saw photos of the man being sought for the campus shooting. \n \n Rowland got the gun by telling an acquaintance that his girlfriend wanted to learn to shoot. \n \n Brophy said it appears the woman who picked up Rowland on campus and the person who loaned him the gun had been duped and are not expected to face charges. \n \n \"Rowland was a manipulator. If his lips were moving, he was lying,\" Brophy said. \"I don't think he told the truth to anybody based on our investigation.\" \n \n Kaitlin Felsted, a spokeswoman for the Utah Department of Corrections, said police didn't make parole officers aware of the complaint filed by McCluskey. \n \n Brophy said police didn't start the formal extortion investigation until six days after her Oct. 13 report due to workload issues. \n \n In the early stages of the investigation, they didn't have enough information to pass on to any other law enforcement, Brophy said, adding that there were no indications from McCluskey that Rowland was threatening physical violence. \n \n University of Utah president Ruth Watkins said outside investigations are being launched to assess campus security and police protocols to determine if improvements can be made to prevent future shootings. \n \n Watkins said so far she has found no mistakes in how police handled the case. Brophy said he welcomes the reviews. \n \n Gov. Gary Herbert said corrections and parole officials had approved independent investigations into the handling of Rowland's parole. \n \n \"Clearly in hindsight, we're going to say, 'You should have done this, you should have done that,'\" Herbert said during his monthly televised news conference at KUED-TV \n \n He noted, however, \"You never know when these things are going to occur.\" \n \n Rowland was paroled in April when he told the parole board that he was a changed man after being a peer leader in prison had helped him tap into his empathy and learn to follow the rules. \n \n He spent nearly a decade in prison after pleading guilty in 2004 to trying to lure an underage girl online and attempted sex abuse charges, according to court records. \n \n After he was charged, a woman came forward to report he had sexually assaulted her after a separate online meeting a few days earlier. \n \n Rowland, a native of New York, was twice sent back to prison for parole violations that included possessing pornography and failure to complete therapy. \n \n He blamed his \"thinking errors\" for the actions that kept sending him back in prison, according to recordings of parole hearings from 2010 to 2018 released this week by the Utah Board of Parole and Pardons. \n \n Rowland said at a hearing in 2012 that he was a womanizer who manipulated women to get what he wanted. \n \n Brophy offered the same assessment. He said McCluskey met Rowland at a bar where he was working security and started dating him. He visited her often in her dorm and made friends with other students in the building. \n \n \"He was very, very good at getting people to trust him,\" Brophy said. \"Lauren was no different.\" \n \n Watkins said she gave McCluskey's parents a posthumous degree for their daughter, a senior from Pullman, Washington, who was majoring in communication. \n \n Utah Jazz star Donovan Mitchell paid tribute to McCluskey by writing her name on his sneakers before Wednesday's game against the Houston Rockets. \n \n \"It was a scary feeling to be close to that. It's just so sad,\" Mitchell told NBA TV after the game. \"I have a little sister. My mom raised me. Women have to be protected more. She was being harassed for two straight weeks. That's so tough. She was defenseless. She couldn't do anything about it. For a man to do that, that's terrible. For me, I just wanted to be able to dedicate this game to her and her family.\" ||||| In the wake of the fatal shooting of student-athlete Lauren McCluskey on campus Monday evening, the University of Utah will initiate a pair of separate reviews into campus safety and how the university police department responded to a complaint from McCluskey about her killer earlier this month. \n \n \"Let me be clear: I have great faith that our university police department worked diligently on this incident,\" university president Ruth Watkins said. \"They too welcome an independent review. We will leave no stone unturned in determining anything we can do to prevent something like this from happening again on our campus.\" \n \n Melvin Rowland, 37, a convicted sex offender who was free on parole, dated McCluskey, a member of the Utah track and field team, for about a month after they met at a bar where he worked as a bouncer, University of Utah police chief Dale Brophy said Thursday at a news conference. McCluskey ended the relationship Oct. 9, after learning about Rowland's criminal background. In the days following the breakup, Rowland attempted to extort McCluskey and stalked her residence before assaulting her in a parking lot and shooting her several times in the back seat of a car, Brophy said. She was 21. \n \n Rowland killed himself hours later in a church as police closed in. \n \n Rowland was convicted of forcible sexual abuse and enticing a minor, both felonies, in 2004 in Utah. On Oct. 9, when McCluskey became aware of his background, she invited him to her dorm to confront him and end the relationship, Brophy told reporters. He said McCluskey allowed Rowland to stay with her that night and borrow her car the next day. \n \n Lauren McCluskey, a member of Utah's track and field team, was shot and killed Monday evening on campus. University of Utah Athletics \n \n On Oct. 10, McCluskey's mother, Jill McCluskey, a professor at Washington State University, contacted campus police dispatch because she was worried her daughter would be forced to go alone to retrieve her car from Rowland. \n \n Police made contact with Lauren McCluskey, but she told them she did not feel uncomfortable having Rowland drop off her car, Brophy said. Police later provided an escort for McCluskey after Rowland dropped her car off in a parking lot several blocks from her dorm. \n \n Two days later, McCluskey began receiving suspicious messages she believed were from Rowland and/or his friends, and she contacted police, Brophy told reporters. She told police the messages didn't make her feel uncomfortable, but told them Rowland's friends were trying to lure her somewhere and she didn't know why, Brophy said. Police later determined Rowland likely was responsible for all the messages McCluskey received. \n \n Then, on Oct. 13, she received a demand for money in order to prevent compromising photos of her and Rowland from being published on the internet, and she met the demand by depositing $1,000 in an account, Brophy said. McCluskey filed a report and university police opened an extortion case against Rowland, but the formal investigation did not begin until Oct. 19 due to workload issues, Brophy said. \n \n Brophy also said the department knew Rowland was a registered sex offender but was not aware Rowland was on parole. In the early stages of the investigation, the police did not have enough information to pass on to any other law enforcement agency, Brophy said, adding that there were no indications from McCluskey that Rowland was threatening physical violence. \n \n Editor's Picks Utah track athlete McCluskey shot and killed University of Utah track athlete Lauren McCluskey was shot and killed Monday night, the school announced. \n \n Utah athlete's killer a self-described manipulator The man who killed Utah track athlete Lauren McCluskey said he sought to manipulate those he met in person or online, according to a recording of his 2012 parole hearing. 1 Related \n \n Rowland was granted parole on Feb. 20 and released in April, public records show. Rowland's address was available on the sex offender database and he was required to check in monthly, according to Kaitlin Felsted, a public information officer for the Utah Department of Corrections. Rowland was last in touch with his parole officer by phone on Oct. 16, and the conversation did not raise any red flags, Felsted said. \n \n Rowland was granted parole on two prior occasions -- in 2012 and 2016 -- but violated the conditions of his release on both occasions and was returned to prison, according to the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole. During one parole hearing, he described himself as a womanizer who manipulated women to get what he wanted and said he was attracted to teenage girls and vulnerable women, and sought to manipulate those he met in person or online, according to a recording of the 2012 hearing released by Utah state authorities. \n \n Gov. Gary Herbert said corrections and parole officials had approved independent investigations into the handling of Rowland's parole. \n \n On the day of McCluskey's killing, Rowland spent several hours hanging out near her residence and attempted to lure her out of her dorm by sending a text message posing as a police officer, Brophy said. When she returned to her dorm, Rowland attacked McCluskey in the parking lot while she was on the phone with her mother and dragged her to the car, where he shot her several times, the chief said. \n \n According to Brophy, Rowland obtained the gun from an acquaintance, whom he told his girlfriend wanted to learn how to shoot. The acquaintance reached out to police voluntarily upon seeing news reports about the shooting and is cooperating with police, Brophy said, but it remains possible the individual could face criminal charges down the line. \n \n After shooting McCluskey, Rowland was picked up by a woman he had recently met on a dating website, Brophy said. They had dinner and went to her apartment, where Rowland showered before leaving. That woman contacted police when she saw Rowland's name in news reports about the shooting and is not expected to face charges, Brophy said. \n \n The external, independent reviews of campus safety measures and the police department's handling of the case will begin as soon as possible, Watkins said. As of Thursday evening, the university had not announced who would lead those reviews. ||||| A University of Utah student who police say was murdered by her ex-boyfriend told officers she wired $1,000 to an account earlier this month to prevent the release of \"compromising pictures\" of the pair, investigators said Thursday. \n \n University Police Chief Dale Brophy told reporters that Lauren McCluskey, 21, reported the extortion to his officers on Oct. 13, nine days before she was found shot dead outside an on-campus dormitory. The suspect in her murder, 37-year-old Melvin Rowland, was found dead that same evening of a self-inflicted gunshot wound inside a Salt Lake City church. \n \n Brophy said that McCluskey had ended her relationship with Rowland on Oct. 9 after she discovered that he had lied to her about his age and was a registered sex offender. McCluskey initially declined police assistance in dealing with Rowland, but later reported receiving numerous emails and messages using different names trying to lure her to locations in addition to the extortion attempt. Investigators now believe the messages all came from Rowland, who Brophy called a master manipulator. \n \n \"If his lips were moving, he was lying,\" Brophy said of Rowland. \"I don't think he told the truth to anybody based on our investigation.\" \n \n Rowland was spotted on surveillance video at various locations around the University of Utah's campus during the weekend before McCluskey's murder. Authorities believe he was trying to confront her. Hours before the killing, Rowland was in McCluskey's dorm building socializing with some of her friends. He later confronted McCluskey in the building parking lot, dragged her into a car he had driven to campus, and shot her multiple times. \n \n After shooting McCluskey, Rowland was picked up on campus by a woman he met online.

    "document": "Sienna Miller was today expected to become the latest public figure to join the legal assault on Scotland Yard and the News of the World over the phone-hacking scandal. \n \n Lawyers for the actor, whose private life has long been a tabloid staple, said she was ready to join the former deputy prime minister John Prescott and others in asking the courts for a judicial review of the police's conduct of the case. \n \n Sources at the News of the World said she had taken the first step towards suing the paper for invading her privacy by allegedly listening to her voicemail messages. \n \n The legal moves came after Miller, 28, discovered that the paper's private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, had procured her mobile phone numbers, account number and secret PIN code, needed to intercept the voicemail of the minority of people who change the factory settings on their phones. \n \n It also emerged today that Sean Hoare, a former News of the World journalist who told the New York Times and the BBC about hacking at the paper under Coulson, has been interviewed by police under caution. Lawyers said this indicated he was being treated by police as a suspect. \"An interview under caution would follow someone being arrested as a suspect, except in the most exceptional circumstances,\" said Peter Lodder QC, a criminal barrister. \n \n Paul McMullan, a second former News of the World staffer who told the Guardian that hacking was rife at the paper, was also contacted by detectives and told that they would like to question him under caution. \n \n Scotland Yard has had the information about Miller being targeted in its possession since August 2006, when Mulcaire was arrested and his records seized, but failed to say anything to Miller until her lawyer, Mark Thomson, of Atkins Thomson, wrote to ask them. Even then an answer was delayed for 14 weeks. \n \n Thomson said: \"Our client only discovered that the Metropolitan police held this information on 15 October 2009 in response to our letter of 10 July 2009.\"Miller had previously sued the News of the World for invading her privacy by running intrusive stories about her relationships and publishing photographs of her in a bikini in Italy and of her filming a nude scene on a closed set. \n \n In 2008, the paper settled the claims by paying her damages and sending her a written acknowledgement that they had been wrong to publish stories and photographs about her private life. \n \n Friends of Miller said she had noticed warning signs with her voicemail, including new messages being recorded as old before she had listened to them. \n \n For this reason, they said, she had changed her mobile number, but the material seized from Mulcaire suggested he had been able to discover her new number. \n \n Former staff at the News of the World say Mulcaire was able to obtain confidential information from mobile phone companies and British Telecom. \n \n Miller plans to join the legal action being run by Bindmans law firm to seek a judicial review of Scotland Yard's failure to warn potential victims of the hacking. \n \n Those already involved in the action include Prescott, Brian Paddick, a former deputy assistant commissioner at Scotland Yard, the Labour frontbench spokesman Chris Bryant and the investigative journalist Brendan Montague. \n \n Meanwhile it was revealed last night that MPs are to investigate whether parliamentary privileges were breached by Mulcaire. The Commons standards and privileges committee, which has been asked by MPs to investigate the matter, has decided to ask the clerk of the House and outside legal experts to advise on whether phone hacking is a contempt of parliament. \n \n Miller is waiting for Scotland Yard to reply to a letter asking for an explanation of its failure to warn her, and Bindmans said she would join the legal action if a satisfactory response was not forthcoming. \n \n During the original investigation in 2006, police told the director of public prosecutions that they would contact all \"potential victims\". But they failed to inform all those where there was clear evidence of successful hacking until after the Guardian revived the story last year and still have not warned all the owners of the 91 PIN codes found in Mulcaire's possession \u2013 Miller was one of them. Police continue to refuse to say how many people they have warned on the grounds that releasing the numbers would risk identifying the individualvictims. ||||| Police quiz ex-News of the World reporter over hacking \n \n Andy Coulson has denied Mr Hoare's claims \n \n Continue reading the main story Related Stories \n \n The former News of the World reporter at the centre of phone hacking allegations has been questioned by police, his solicitor has said. \n \n Sean Hoare was interviewed by officers under caution. He was not arrested. \n \n Mr Hoare alleged in a recent interview with a US newspaper that his former editor at the News of the World, Andy Coulson, asked him to hack phones. \n \n Mr Coulson, who denied Mr Hoare's claims, is now Prime Minister David Cameron's communications chief. \n \n Earlier on Tuesday, Parliament's Standards and Privileges Committee said it would launch an inquiry into whether the hacking of MPs phones amounts to contempt of parliament. \n \n The committee was asked to look into the issue of MPs phones being hacked following a Commons vote last week. \n \n The committee now says it will not look into specific cases - such as alleged hacking of MPs' phones by News of the World journalists - but instead question experts on whether hacking amounts to contempt of Parliament. \n \n If the committee decides that phone hacking does not amount to contempt it would be expected to hold only a brief inquiry, and would be unlikely to call any witnesses from the News of the World. \n \n However, if the committee decided that there had been possible contempt, a wider inquiry could be triggered. \n \n Former News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire were jailed in 2007 for accessing the voice mails of public figures. \n \n Also on Tuesday, representatives of comic Steve Coogan and presenter Chris Tarrant said they were taking legal action after the Metropolitan Police confirmed that their clients' personal details were in the possession of Mr Mulcaire. \n \n Mr Tarrant's lawyer, Mark Lewis, said the action was \"at a very early stage\".",

    "document": "SAN JOSE, CA - JANUARY 28: A small pool of water is surrounded by dried and cracked earth that was the bottom of the Almaden Reservoir on January 28, 2014 in San Jose, California. Now in its third straight year of drought conditions, California is experiencing its driest year on record, dating back 119 years, and reservoirs throughout the state have low water levels. Santa Clara County reservoirs are at 3 percent of capacity or lower. California Gov. Jerry Brown officially declared a drought emergency to speed up assistance to local governments, streamline water transfers and potentially ease environmental protection requirements for dam releases. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)A small pool of water is surrounded by dried and cracked earth that was the bottom of the Almaden Reservoir. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) ||||| The directive comes more than a year after Brown asked for a 20% voluntary cut in water use that most parts of the state have failed to attain, even as one of the most severe modern droughts drags into a fourth year. It also came on the day that water officials measured the lowest April 1 snowpack in more than 60 years of record-keeping in the Sierra Nevada. \n \n \n \n Wearing hiking shoes and a windbreaker in an area that normally requires cross-country skis this time of year, Brown announced the executive order in a Sierra Nevada meadow that provided a dramatic illustration of the state's parched conditions. \n \n \n \n \"We're standing on dry grass,\" Brown said. \"We should be standing on five feet of snow.\" \n \n \n \n Emphasizing that the drought could persist, Brown said Californians must change their water habits. \"It's a different world,\" he said. \"We have to act differently.\" \n \n \n \n The order focused on urban life even though agriculture accounts for roughly three quarters of Californians' water usage. Cities have to stop watering the median strips that run down the middle of roads. The state will partner with local agencies to remove 50 million square feet of grass \u2014 the equivalent of about 1,150 football fields \u2014 and replace it with drought-tolerant landscaping. \n \n \n \n State agencies will create a temporary rebate program to encourage homeowners to replace water-guzzling appliances with high-efficiency ones. Golf courses, campuses and cemeteries must cut their water use. New developments will have to install drip or microspray systems if they irrigate with drinking water. Water agencies will discourage water waste with higher rates and fees. \n \n \n \n The order aims to reduce the amount of water used statewide in urban areas in 2013 by 25%. \n \n \n \n Some critics of Brown's order said it didn't do enough to address agricultural uses. Adam Scow, director of Food & Water Watch California, called the order disappointing. \n \n \n \n \"The governor must save our groundwater from depletion by directing the state water board to protect groundwater as a public resource,\" Scow said in a statement. \n \n \n \n Felicia Marcus, chairwoman of the State Water Resources Control Board, said the measure isn't about \"finger-pointing\"\u2026\"It's about everybody having to step up in these tough times.\" \n \n \n \n The water board will release draft regulations in mid-April to implement the order. It plans to approve the regulations in early May. \n \n \n \n Marcus said local agencies will receive targets for cutting water use based on how well they've done so far \n \n \n \n Local agencies that have been slow to conserve since then will feel the order's effects most dramatically, Marcus said. \n \n \n \n \"You're rewarding the early adopters ... and you're saying to the laggers, 'You have to make a change,'\" she said. \n \n \n \n Most of the burden of enforcement will fall on local agencies. \n \n \n \n If they don't follow the governor's order, the state can fine them as much as $10,000 a day. \n \n \n \n Many Southern California agencies are already taking steps called for in Brown's order. For instance, under a turf rebate program administered by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, spokesman Bob Muir said homeowners are planning to remove almost 89 million square feet of turf, the equivalent of more than 59,000 frontyards. It's unclear whether Brown's mandate for 50 million square feet of lawn replacement includes work already done by local agencies. Similarly, Los Angeles already has a tiered water-rate structure to encourage conservation. \n \n \n \n Although Southern California water managers said it might be tough for some cities to meet the 25% target, they welcomed Brown's action. \n \n \n \n \"It's the right time. It's a proper directive,\" said Rob Hunter, general manager of the Municipal Water District of Orange County. \n \n \n \n Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti praised the executive order, noting that last year he called for a 20% cut in the city's water use by 2017. \n \n \n \n In Long Beach, Water Department General Manager Kevin Wattier said the order would have the biggest effect on water districts that use much more water per capita than Long Beach and Los Angeles. \n \n \n \n \"The governor understands we don't have time to allow any voluntary measures to work,\" said Mark Gold of UCLA's Institute of the Environment and Sustainability. \"This is such a growing crisis that mandatory conservation was absolutely necessary.\" \n \n \n \n Lester Snow, executive director of the California Water Foundation and former state secretary of natural resources, said even more restrictions may be necessary in the future, such as banning all outdoor water use. \"We're probably going to need more action before we're through the summer,\" he said. \n \n \n \n Brown issued his order at Phillips Station, about 90 miles east of Sacramento, where state workers conducted a manual snow survey as part of statewide readings that revealed that the water content of the Sierra Nevada snowpack was only about 5% of the average for April 1. That is the lowest for the date in records going back to 1950. \n \n \n \n The Sierra snowpack accounts for about 30% of the state's water supply, and although major reservoir storage is better than it was last year, there will be little snowmelt to replenish reservoirs this spring. \n \n \n \n Nurit Katz, UCLA's Chief Sustainability Officer and co-chair of a UC system-wide water task force, said every campus has created a water action plan focused on reducing consumption. UCLA is installing artificial turf on its intramural field, retrofitting fixtures such as toilets and developing a smart water filtration system. \n \n \n \n Combined with other efforts, the campus expects to save millions of gallons of water each year, she said. \n \n \n \n Brown's order requires agricultural districts in depleted groundwater basins to share data on groundwater use with the state. \n \n \n \n \"The agricultural community is already being hit very hard,\" Marcus said. \n \n \n \n For the second year in a row, Central Valley growers without senior water rights are likely to get no supplies from the valley's big federal irrigation project. Last year farmers idled about 500,000 acres for lack of water, and this year they may be forced to leave even more cropland unplanted. \n \n \n \n \"Some people want to say, 'What about the farmers?' And farmers want to say, 'What about those people watering their lawns?'\" Brown said. \"We all have something to do, and we can all do a little better.\"",

(Photo: By Julio Cortez, AP) Story Highlights The phrase 'Blue Moon' refers to the second blue moon in a month \n \n The next Blue Moon will not take place until 2015 \n \n The traditional Blue Moon is not really blue, but there have been blue moons \n \n It's been the motivation for romantic songs and popular phrases, and if you're not doing anything tonight, you should head outside or get yourself to a window so you can see it for yourself. \n \n The last Blue Moon that we'll see until 2015 is up in the sky until Wednesday morning. It's not really blue. The phrase \"blue moon\" for many people commonly refers to a rare second full moon in a month, although the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington, while noting disagreement among the public, describes it as, \" ... the third full moon to in an astronomical season in which four full moons fall.\" This kind of moon appears only once every three years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \n \n On social media, amateur and professional photographers took advantage of the clear night and snapped and shared photos of the pristine moon against a navy sky. The buzz came from news organizations to every day people to folks like actor John Cusack, who retweeted a photo of the Blue Moon. \n \n People had jokes too, tweeting photos of Belgian White Blue Moon ale and video of 1961's \"Blue Moon\" by The Marcels. \n \n The Blue Moon also is known as the Full Sturgeon Moon, Green Corn Moon, Grain Moon orFull Red Moon. Initially, the phrase referred to the third full moon in a month, but an incorrect explanation in a 1943 edition of Sky and Telescope magazine stuck, according to space.com. \n \n By the way, although tonight's Blue Moon is not actually blue, there have been blue moons in history, according to NOAA. The last one, however, appeared over Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1950 and was due to moon light traveling through a cloud of particles from forest fires in Canada, NOAA says. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/169QXvH ||||| A blue moon rising tonight is the first full moon of August, yet it is still considered \"blue.\" (Photo: Reuters) \n \n A blue moon will illuminate the night sky tonight. Pop quiz: what is a blue moon? If you said \"a moon that is blue,\" you'd be pretty wrong, but also sort of right. If you said \"the second full moon in a calendar month,\" with a self-satisfied grin, you'd be sort of right, but should also probably be taken down a notch. If you said \"a pretty decent wheat beer,\" you'd be technically right, but would be off topic. \n \n Like Us on Facebook \n \n It turns out that the scientific definition of a blue moon is a bit confusing. So here's the deal. \n \n Though tonight's full moon is the first of August, it is actually a blue moon. That's because the original definition of a blue moon is the third of four full moons in a season, and that is still the most valid definition of a blue moon. \n \n A little light math is necessary here. The lunation, or lunar cycle, is 29.53 days; one solar year is 365.25 days. This means there are 12.37 lunar cycles every solar year -- a number slightly larger than cycle of 12 months that makes up our calendar year. That means that 12 calendar months (or one year) are about 11 days longer than 12 lunar cycles. These \"extra\" 11 days accumulate, so that every two to three years there end up being an additional full moon in a season. \n \n A new definition of a blue moon emerged in 1946, and all because of a mistake in an astronomy magazine Sky & Telescope. In the article \"Once in a Blue Moon,\" amateur astronomer James Hugh Pruett quoted the 1937 Maine Farmer's Almanac (which is unrelated to the more famous Farmer's Almanac), saying that the moon sometimes \"comes full thirteen times in a year.\" \n \n \"Seven times in 19 years there were -- and still are -- 13 full moons in a year,\" Pruett extrapolated from that quote. \"This gives 11 months with one full moon each and one with two. This second in a month, so I interpret it, was called Blue Moon.\" \n \n That's the definition, \"two full moons in one calendar month,\" that has stuck for most people. (It's also a far less complicated definition to understand, so maybe that helped too.) \n \n Then there is the other literal definition of a blue moon, in which the moon appears to be, well, blue. That can occur when particles in the atmosphere cause the moon to take on a hue. \n \n For instance, when Krakatoa erupted in 1883, the moon appeared to be blue for almost two years. \n \n \"There was a time, not long ago, when people saw blue moons almost every night. Full moons, half moons, crescent moons--they were all blue, except some nights when they were green,\" wrote Tony Phillips on NASA's Solar System Exploration site. Large ash particles from Krakatoa \"[scatted] red light, while allowing other colors to pass. White moonbeams shining through the clouds emerged blue and sometimes green.\" \n \n Similar \"blue moons\" occurred in 1983 in Chiapas, Mexico, after the eruption of the El Chichon volcano, and in Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991. \n \n Now that the confusion is cleared up, go enjoy your blue moon tonight. The next one won't be until July 31, 2015, if you go by the \"mistake\" definition, or on May 21, 2016, if you go by the original definition. \n \n READ MORE: \n \n National Park On The Moon: Lunar Act Would Protect Artifacts In Space \n \n Pluto Moons Named Styx And Kerberos, Despite Overwhelming Vote for 'Vulcan' \n \n Supermoon Live Stream: Where To Watch 2013's Brightest Full Moon [VIDEO]",

But wait, you exclaim! Last night was August's first full moon, so something must be amiss, right? International Science Times clears things up: The first (and, in its telling, \"most valid\") definition of a blue moon is the third of four full moons that occur in a single season. A season would typically have only three, and this extra moon comes about every two to three years. The next will be in 2015.",

    "document": "If you think young Americans are lazy, spend five minutes talking with Maria Rose Belding. \n \n The 20-year-old American University sophomore is the co-founder of MEANS Database, which connects people, organizations, and businesses with extra food with food banks and pantries that need it. In its first year, the food recovery notification system rescued about 4,000 pounds of food; became the first non-profit to win the GW New Venture Competition; and just took home a $10,000 prize from L\u2019Oreal Paris through its Women Of Worth campaign. (At the L\u2019Oreal Paris celebration event last week, Belding was the youngest of the 10 honorees.) It\u2019s also figuring out how to make enough money to become self sufficient, a rarity for non-profits. \n \n meansdatabase.com \n \n MEANS operates through both a website and an app, creating a simple system: A donor lists what\u2019s available, donees nearby get notifications, someone claims it and arranges for pick-up. As a high school freshman, Belding was volunteering at a local soup pantry in her hometown in Iowa, when she watched the director scramble to find recipients for the 10,000 boxes of macaroni and cheese a church had donated. Not everything found a home before the expiration date, and a lot ended up in the trash. \n \n In the world of food waste, this is the oft-cited paradox: There are 48 million Americans living in food insecurity, meaning that, at times during the year, these households were uncertain of having, or unable to acquire, enough food because they didn\u2019t have sufficient money or other resources. Yet Americans waste an estimated 40% of the country\u2019s food. It\u2019s not a problem of supply or demand. It\u2019s connecting the two. \n \n Hunger is a problem hitting more people than most realize, including college students. \u201cWe have several campus food pantries on MEANS,\u201d Belding tells Quartz. \u201cWe will be able to funnel food to the same kids we sit in class with.\u201d \n \n Belding\u2019s idea didn\u2019t become a reality, though, until she met her co-founder, Grant Nelson. He developed the technology while she found the donors, food banks, and pantries that would use the database. \n \n The technology and wide reach\u2014it currently has over 200 donor and recipient accounts representing more than 2,000 partner agencies and programs, spread out over 27 states\u2014are largely what makes MEANS different from other food rescue organizations. City Harvest, for example, provides a similar service in New York, rescuing a whopping 50 million pounds of food just this year. But it works at a larger scale and arranges the legwork itself, like matching and transporting donations with food kitchens that need them. The MEANS platform allows small organizations and individuals to participate on a scale that might be too small for an organization like City Harvest, but crucial to the people they help. Belding says nearly every donation finds a new home\u2014the only one she could remember that didn\u2019t was 23 individually wrapped cupcakes with a very short window of recovery time. \n \n Getty Images for L'Oreal Paris Belding strikes a pose at the L\u2019Oreal Paris Women of Worth 2015 Celebration in New York. \n \n Thanks in part to wins like the one from GW ($42,500 in cash and $20,000 in prizes) and L\u2019Oreal, MEANS now has a staff of 11 people, as well as 10 interns and volunteers. But, says Belding, \u201cI\u2019m not content to be chasing other people\u2019s money.\u201d So she and her team are working on a system to help them become less grant dependent. \n \n While large retail donors don\u2019t currently claim tax credits for their donation\u2014they\u2019re too small and localized to be worth the trouble\u2014MEANS already tracks all the information they would need. \u201dFor us, it\u2019s a matter of keystrokes,\u201d says Belding. \n \n Companies can use it to get tax benefits, while MEANS\u2014which is free for users\u2014takes a small fee. \u201dWe haven\u2019t started executing it yet, but every conversation with retailers we\u2019ve had has been, \u2018You can build that?'\u201d \n \n Next year, Belding hopes to launch that program, grow and improve the one already in place, and create a public, searchable directory of food pantries. (She\u2019s found that half the pantries she and her team have called list wrong numbers.) \n \n This week, though, Belding is focused on finals. On top of the full-time hours she puts into MEANS\u2014she didn\u2019t want to say how many because her parents will read the story\u2014she is still a student. And a very impressive one. Her report card this semester, she says, should be all As and A-minuses. \u201cThere might be a B-plus, but I\u2019m hoping not.\u201d ||||| Hear me out. \n \n I hated math in high school. In my 10th grade diary, I referred to geometry as 'a bunch of self-important shapes searching for nonexistent meaning.' (Sorry, Mr. Cutler.) At 16, I was full of sarcasm and empty of self-awareness, convinced learning trig was a waste of time and a distraction from the side project holding all my interest: trying to build a website for emergency food providers. Math felt like an exercise in frustration and wholly disconnected from trying to feed people struggling with hunger. \n \n I was wrong. \n \n I was trying to build a program that made it easier for emergency feeding systems like food pantries to communicate with each other and their donors. The idea, which I called MEANS (Matching Excess And Need for Stability), made sense in my head, but I couldn't get it to translate to a computer. That changed when I met Grant Nelson, a GWU law student who grew up 45 minutes from my Iowa hometown. A self-taught programmer, he looked at my idea and said, \"I think I can build that.\" He did. \n \n Grant became MEANS' co-founder and director of tech. He'd only been inside a food pantry once and I'd never seen real computer code. It was a huge learning curve for both of us, and one I couldn't have calculated the arc of if my life depended on it. As Grant introduced me to the concept of data science, it was clear I owed a few high school math teachers an apology. (Sorry, guys. I hope this makes up for some of the masterful eye rolls I sent your subject's way over the years.) \n \n I'm 20 now, and while my sarcasm supply is still aplenty, I've done a 180 on how I feel about math. (See what I did there?) There are now 11 young people, age 18 to 27, on Team MEANS, and we're working with hundreds of users representing thousands of programs and partnerships to reduce food waste and hunger at the same time. We're using a whole lot of math to do it, from tackling big data to determine the food pantries most likely to need and use MEANS to developing a public directory of emergency food resources around the country. It was because of meticulous record-keeping and data science that we discovered that as many as 50% of online listings for emergency food providers have incorrect contact information, and it is through coding and more data science that we're working to fix it. Math isn't the problem I thought it was - it's the solution. \n \n MEANS is an incredibly simple idea. Food pantries tell our system where they are, what they need and how far they're willing to travel to get it. The same platform allows pantries to notify their neighbor agencies when they're overwhelmed with a too-large donation, with traditional donors like grocery stores and restaurants able to use the same website to get food into the hands of the hungry. Our concept is simple and the execution extraordinarily complicated. Without math and its cooler cousin data science, we could have never brought MEANS to life. \n \n Math matters, for developing strategy, discovering the big picture and daring to think as differently as we have about hunger and food waste. Math can draw us a map of where to go next and numbers can lead us down paths we never considered before. There is too much need in this world to be focused solely on doing good - we have to also focus on doing that good well. Hunger is an enormous problem, and with 48 million Americans struggling to put food on the table, we need absolutely every tool we can find to build smart, sustainable solutions. MEANS lives in the space where empathy and entrepreneurship meet, and I'm so proud of a staff that never aims low and is always pushing for new goals. Charity can and should have a big brain to match its big heart. After all, if I remember correctly...with the right team, it's possible to build an equation where the limit does not exist. \n \n Maria Rose Belding is a (mostly) reformed high school math class nap-taker and co-founder/executive director of the MEANS Database. Now a college sophomore, Maria Rose is a nationally published writer on hunger and poverty, and the resources she developed for high schoolers tackling food insecurity are in the hands of more than a thousand students in schools in nine countries. She was recognized as a L'Or\u00e9al Paris Women of Worth in 2015 for making an extraordinary difference in her community. ||||| Maria Rose Belding and Grant Nelson founded a sprawling online network that connects thousands of food pantries in 24 states, allowing those organizations to quickly share surplus food that might have gone to waste otherwise. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) \n \n One of the most profound contradictions of modern America is that more than 45 million Americans don\u2019t have enough to eat, but the country wastes an estimated 40 percent of its food. The forces fueling this paradox are complex: Grocery stores think they\u2019ll assume legal liability in donating food. Farmers allow edible, but homely fruit to rot in fear it won\u2019t sell. Bananas blacken on all our shelves. \n \n But the reasons behind this waste didn\u2019t feel so complex to a teenage girl named Maria Rose Belding on a chilly Iowa day five years ago. \n \n The whole thing felt simple. It felt wrong. It felt like something had to change. \n \n Belding, then a volunteer at a local food pantry in Pella, had just thrown out hundreds of boxes of expired mac and cheese in front of numerous people lining up outside to collect food. \n \n \u201cWe were throwing away all of this food just because we couldn\u2019t communicate,\u201d Belding, then a freshman in high school, remembers venting that day. That frustration would ultimately lead the American University sophomore to develop a groundbreaking innovation in the long \u2014 and often inefficient \u2014 war on hunger. \n \n After years of research, Belding, 20, has founded a sprawling online network that connects thousands of food pantries in 24 states, allowing them to quickly share surplus food that might have otherwise gone to waste. Pantries simply post their excess food to the program \u2014 and someone else in the network picks it up and puts it to use. The database has saved an estimated two tons of food. \n \n L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris has since lauded the program, last week naming Belding one of its 10 women of worth. So has Arianna Huffington. And experts agree programs such as the interactive MEANS website, which stands for Matching Excess and Need for Stability, can close lapses in communication between pantries and chip away at the country\u2019s colossal problem with chronic waste. \n \n Food waste \u201cneeds to be addressed on multiple levels,\u201d said Mathy Stanislaus, a senior official with the Environmental Protection Agency who works on ending food waste. \u201cPart is wider knowledge of the problem, but also tools [like this] to reduce waste.\u201d \n \n The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. Food production accounts for around 10 percent of the national energy budget, uses half of the country\u2019s land and consumes around 80 percent of all the freshwater used in the United States, according to a paper published in 2012 by the National Resources Defense Council. \n \n That means, the study noted, Americans squander $165 billion every year on food destined for landfills, where the decomposition of organic matter emits 16 percent of the country\u2019s methane \u2014 a greenhouse gas that\u2019s 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide. \n \n Even people who donate to their local pantries are contributing, to some degree, to the problem. Emergency food centers have long been the last stop for whatever\u2019s lurking in the back of America\u2019s cupboards. And so, people donate an endless supply of near-expired creamed corn, beans and Honeybuns. The excess of product often does one of two things. It expires on the shelf and gets thrown out. Or it clutters the pantry so much that nonprofits can\u2019t accept premium donations that could immediately serve a community. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s very common for grocers to give poorly selling products in bulk to emergency food providers,\u201d Belding said. \u201cThat\u2019s just fine. But when you get 400 jars of peanut butter and you have two weeks to get rid of them and serve 100 people a month, total, and only distribute four times a month, that rapidly becomes a problem.\u201d \n \n When Belding started researching the concept behind the MEANS database while in high school, she was sure someone had beaten her to it. But she soon realized that the emergent technologies that had upended so many industries \u2014 tools to discern opportunity in unlikely places \u2014 hadn\u2019t yet found their way to the nation\u2019s nonprofit food pantries. Around half of the phone numbers listed under food pantries, she said, didn\u2019t even work. \n \n Belding thought she might be onto something. In her mind, there was clear need for a network. And so, at the beginning of her freshman year, she arrived at a friend\u2019s house and got to talking with his 24-year-old brother, Grant Nelson. Nelson, now a third-year law student at George Washington University and program co-founder, had experience with building programs. So she asked him if he could help. \n \n He wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to. \u201cThis struck me as a changing-people\u2019s-behavior problem, rather than providing a tool to fulfill a need,\u201d he said. \u201cI said: \u2018Phones exist. Emails exist. Twitter exists. Facebook exists. What could we possibly build that would be slicker for all of the food banks and food pantries to communicate with each other that isn\u2019t already solved by something else?\u2019 \u201d \n \n In the end, he helped anyway. It took more than a year. A year of planning, researching and building program after program. Then in February, the website launched. \n \n Months passed. In May, Belding was sitting in class when she saw one of their nascent users had posted an item to the site. This was the moment, she realized, when the project would either succeed or fail. A sense of panic seized her when she saw someone was giving away assorted varieties of canned beans. \u201cThey\u2019re like the off-brand Mountain Dew in the food world,\u201d Belding said. \u201cYou\u2019ll take it only if you have no other option. . . . So we were all anxiously sitting by our computers hitting refresh, and I said, \u2018Please, someone take this.\u2019 And then, it\u2019s gone. It just disappeared. . . . The beans had moved.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe were kind of desperate,\u201d said Stephanie Shallah, an official with the District\u2019s So Others Might Eat who had posted the item. \u201cBeans come so often to me that I didn\u2019t think anyone would want them. So I said, \u2018I\u2019m going to just post it and see what happens.\u2019 I said, \u2018I have nothing to lose.\u2019 \u201d She said a Landover pantry serving a large Hispanic population took the goods. \n \n Things then happened very quickly for MEANS. The organization now commands a staff of several programmers paid through grant money and even a few interns who Belding concedes are older than she. The number of members on the site has grown from around 50 larger food banks in June to more than 200, opening up a network of thousands of smaller-shop pantries that work under the umbrella of those banks. \n \n But there\u2019s still a lot of work to do, Belding said. There are still 26 states that remain untapped. There\u2019s still the world. Belding said she had more calls to make. More connections to forge.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 There are 48 million Americans who, at some point each year, may be unable to get enough food. Meanwhile, a third of the country's food goes to waste. This isn't as easy an issue to solve as it sounds\u2014something Maria Rose Belding realized while volunteering at a soup pantry as a teen. At one point, the pantry received 10,000 boxes of mac 'n cheese, but couldn't find enough people in need before the stuff expired, reports Quartz. \"We were throwing away all of this food just because we couldn't communicate,\" Belding tells the Washington Post. Now a 20-year-old American University student, Belding hopes the app and website she co-created can help: Overflowing pantries list what extra food they have available on the MEANS (Matching Excess and Need for Stability) Database, and neighboring pantries get notifications, Belding writes at the Huffington Post. Grocery stores and restaurants with food to unload can make use of the site, too. Belding remembers watching the first donation of canned beans pop up after MEANS launched in February. \"We were all anxiously sitting by our computers hitting refresh,\" she says\u2014the anxiety intensified by the fact that beans are donated so regularly they aren't a hot commodity. Suddenly, \"it just disappeared.\" Since then, the database has kept 4,000 pounds of food from the trash. While a similar service saved 50 million pounds of food in New York in 2015 by matching donations with food kitchens, MEANS allows smaller organizations to do the ground work themselves, and currently has 200 accounts across 27 states. While grants and awards keep the site running for now, Belding has plans: to track large retailers' donations from a tax-benefit perspective, something most don't currently do since those donations are made on such a local level. MEANS would charge a small fee for doing all the tracking. (On the food front, this young chef has left one of the world's best restaurants to try to save America's school lunch program.)",

Sign Up \n \n SANTA ROSA (CBS SF) \u2014 Hundreds of protesters gathered in Santa Rosa and in cities throughout the Bay Area and the state Saturday to protest the police killing of 13-year-old Andy Lopez in Sonoma County last month as well as what they say is an epidemic of police brutality. \n \n The protests in Santa Rosa, San Francisco, Oakland, Sacramento Los Angeles and elsewhere were part of a \u201cNational Day of Action for Andy Lopez\u201d organized by the Answer Coalition and the California Statewide Coalition Against Police Brutality. \n \n Andy was walking and holding a toy AK-47 rifle in rural Sonoma County the afternoon of Oct. 22 when county sheriff\u2019s deputies on patrol in the area spotted him and yelled for him to drop the weapon, according to the sheriff\u2019s office. \n \n When the boy turned toward the deputies, Deputy Erick Gelhaus, 48, shot him seven times, according to authorities. \n \n Andy\u2019s family has filed a civil rights lawsuit against Gelhaus and the county. \n \n The killing has sparked outrage within the community, state and nationwide, with many decrying the incident as a tragic example of police brutality that protesters say often targets low-income black and Latino citizens. \n \n \u201cWe are heartbroken and outraged that Andy Lopez was murdered by Erick Gelhaus of the Sonoma County Sheriff\u2019s Department,\u201d said Christina Arechiga, an organizer with the California Statewide Coalition Against Police Brutality. \u201cWe demand police terror on American citizens stop immediately. We demand Justice for Andy Lopez, his family and his community.\u201d \n \n During Saturday\u2019s protest in Santa Rosa, volunteers were in the process stories from attendees about their own experiences with police brutality, Arechiga said. \n \n \u201cA lot of people are afraid to come forward, but in light of the Lopez family\u2019s courage and these community gatherings, there\u2019s a lot of stories being told,\u201d said Arechiga, whose cousin Ernest Duenez, Jr. was shot and killed by a police officer in Manteca two years ago. \n \n In Oakland Saturday afternoon, more than 100 protesters took part in the national day of action, marching from the Fruitvale BART station to the Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s Office, said Answer Coalition organizer Michelle Schudel. \n \n Schudel said people came from throughout the East Bay to protest Andy\u2019s killing and to stand in solidarity with his family and others who have lost loved ones to police fire. \n \n She said the killing is similar to what people \u201chave to deal with in Oakland and in San Francisco, where police are brutalizing and targeting our families, our communities for being African American or Latino.\u201d \n \n Organizers said more than 100 protesters gathered for about an hour Saturday afternoon at the 24th and Mission BART station in San Francisco to speak out against Andy\u2019s death. \n \n (Copyright 2013 by CBS San Francisco and Bay City News Service.

(Conner Jay/The Press Democrat) X In announcing her decision, Ravitch released a 52-page summary of her findings that includes several new details about the shooting, including that Lopez was likely high on marijuana at the time he was killed. Blood samples taken from Lopez's body during the autopsy revealed significant levels of THC, the psychoactive compound in marijuana, according to the report. The levels were consistent with Lopez smoking marijuana 60 to 75 minutes prior to his death, according to Dr. Reese Jones, a specialist hired by the District Attorney's Office to review the findings. Lopez also had a joint and a bottle of Visine on his body at the time he was killed, according to the report. The THC levels in Lopez's system likely affected his behavior that day, Jones said. \u201cCognitive and behavioral effects that typically follow marijuana use would likely have been present to a significant degree during the interval following,\u201d Jones wrote, according to the report. A 13-year-old boy high on marijuana would likely have had suffered \u201cimpaired judgment, slowed decision making and increased mental processing time,\u201d the report found, \u201cparticularly when having to deal with performance of a sudden, unanticipated tasks, including decisions that needed to be quickly responded to.\u201d View as one page 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 Next \n \n (page 2 of 7) The new information provides potentially important context for the day of the shooting and may help explain why Lopez did not initially drop the gun when ordered and instead turned toward officers. Gelhaus, a 24-year Sonoma County deputy and Iraq War veteran, told Santa Rosa police investigating the shooting that he thought Lopez was carrying a real assault rifle when he ordered the boy to drop the gun. Lopez did not drop the gun and instead began to turn, the barrel of the airsoft gun rising as he pivoted, according to police. The deputy fired eight rounds, striking him seven times. Investigators determined Gelhaus feared for his life and prosecutors concluded his response \u2014 including the number of shots he fired, in a span of several seconds \u2014 was reasonable, Ravitch said. She noted that Gelhaus's weapon holds 18 rounds and can fire eight rounds in two seconds. \u201cThe evidence establishes that while in the lawful performance of his duties, Deputy Gelhaus was faced with a highly unpredictable and rapidly evolving situation,\u201d Ravitch said. \u201cGiven his training and experience, he believed honestly and reasonably that he was faced with a do-or-die dilemma.\u201d His options were to wait for Lopez to fire what he believed to be a deadly weapon at him and his partner, or to fire at Lopez \u201cwhen the threat was turned toward him,\u201d Ravitch said. \u201cHere the implementation of lethal force was a reasonable response under the circumstances according to all the evidence that we have reviewed,\u201d she said. The announcement was met with outrage outside the 2 p.m. press conference at the county government administration complex, where protesters denounced Ravitch's decision and vowed to press for justice for Lopez. One carried a sign that read simply \u201cShame.\u201d Jonathan Melrod, an attorney and one of the most vocal activists, said Ravitch's decision was based on \u201cpatent lies.\u201d View as one page Prev 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 Next \n \n (page 3 of 7) He described Lopez as \u201ca boy with a toy gun who did not pose a threat to anyone, to the deputy, to the neighborhood. He was a kid!\u201d Melrod screamed into a scrum of television cameras. \u201cThat is an injustice that cannot be permitted!\u201d He and others who have called for Gelhaus' prosecution said the shooting was a consequence of the wider militarization of the nation's police departments. \u201cThe police feel that we the community are their enemy,\u201d Melrod said. \u201cThey police us as though they are still in Iraq or Afghanistan.\u201d Melrod later said he had been unaware that Lopez had marijuana in his system until informed by a reporter. He said the focus on marijuana in the report was a \u201ctransparent attempt\u201d to deflect blame away from \u201cthe sheriff's deputy who pulled the trigger and to place it on Andy Lopez.\u201d \u201cLet's assume there was THC. Does that justify executing Andy?\u201d said Melrod, who questioned why Ravitch waited until now to raise the issue. Nicole Guerra, who said her son Antonio was one of Lopez's best friends, called the idea that Gelhaus didn't commit a crime \u201cridiculous.\u201d \u201cThese kids now have to walk around in fear because they know these cops can get away with murder,\u201d Guerra said. Activists gathered in Roseland Monday afternoon and evening for a march to the Moorland Avenue location where Lopez was killed. They planned a rally for 1 p.m. Tuesday in Old Courthouse Square. The decision comes eight months after the fatal encounter on the outskirts of southwest Santa Rosa. Word of the decision spread quickly after Ravitch's office sent out an email announcing the news conference Monday and mistakenly attached a press release detailing her decision. About 12 p.m., Arnoldo Casillas, the Lopez family's attorney, said he received a personal phone call from Ravitch informing him of her decision. \u201cThe family and my office are greatly disappointed with the decision,\u201d Casillas said. \u201cIf there was ever a case where charges were warranted, it was this one.\u201d View as one page Prev 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 Next \n \n (page 4 of 7) Casillas said the decision would allow the family's federal civil rights lawsuit against Gelhaus and the county to go forward. The suit accuses the deputy of acting recklessly and seeks unspecified damages. Sonoma County Sheriff Steve Freitas said that the district attorney's conclusion mirrored his office's internal investigation into the shooting. He said he is \u201cabsolutely confident that it was a thorough investigation, fair and impartial.\u201d \u201cIn this case I think the evidence shows both deputies absolutely believed they were faced with a real AK-47,\u201d Freitas said. The other deputy on patrol with Gelhaus, Michael Schemmel, an eight-year veteran with the Marin County Sheriff's Office who was hired by Sonoma County in September, did not fire his weapon. Gelhaus, a firearms instructor who returned to work Dec. 10, has been on duty in the department's armory and not on patrol in the community. Freitas said his commanders will talk with Gelhaus and make a decision about whether his assignment will change. Gelhaus' safety will be a factor in that decision, he said. Gelhaus' attorney Terry Leoni said she was notified at about 11 a.m. Monday that her client will not face criminal charges. She called Gelhaus, who is out of the area on a prescheduled vacation, and said he was \u201cvery relieved.\u201d \u201cThis has been an extremely difficult time for Erick. He has certainly grieved for the Lopez family,\u201d Leoni said. \u201cIt hasn't been easy for him in terms of the media and public scrutiny but also for the loss of this child.\u201d Leoni said that she and her client had been \u201cin the dark\u201d throughout much of the investigation, although they cooperated by providing statements and information when needed. \u201cYou're always concerned whether the charging agency or District Attorney's Office is going to make the right choice, look at the law, apply the facts of the law,\u201d Leoni said. \u201cThere's always a concern that they will be swayed by the political aspects or mob mentality. We are glad the District Attorney's Office took (its) time.\u201d View as one page Prev 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 Next \n \n (page 5 of 7) Santa Rosa Police Chief Hank Schreeder said that his officers didn't recommend an outcome when they handed their investigation to the District Attorney's Office on Jan. 29. \u201cThe District Attorney has to decide on the points of law. We are just the fact finders,\u201d Schreeder said. Ravitch, who has faced criticism over the length of her inquiry, called her review of the police investigation into the shooting \u201cexhaustive and thorough,\u201d resulting in reports that totaled more than 1,000 pages. District Attorney investigators responded to the scene Oct. 22 and worked alongside Santa Rosa police called in to investigate, with assistance from Petaluma police. Ravitch said she assigned an attorney and an investigator who both have significant homicide experience to conduct her office's review and ensure any additional investigative steps took place. She said she chose people who don't have longstanding ties to Sonoma County law enforcement to ensure neutrality. The bulk of their work began after receiving the Santa Rosa Police Department's report on the shooting. That report included interviews with about 200 witnesses, 200 hours of recorded interviews and 175 items of evidence, among other materials, Ravitch told reporters at the press conference Monday. The investigative team re-interviewed witnesses and spoke with a pathologist hired by the Lopez family who conducted an additional autopsy. They also consulted with numerous outside sources, including people with expertise in how people perform in high-stress encounters, and an weapons expert who estimated it would take two seconds to fire eight rounds with the type of gun Gelhaus used. The office even hired a company to do a 3D analysis of the trajectory of the eight shots Gelhaus fired. It concluded that the first shot likely missed Lopez, hitting a home behind him. The next one likely struck him in the upper left arm as he was \u201cdirectly facing\u201d the deputy, the report found. The remaining six shots probably hit him as he was turning, falling down or had hit the ground, the report found. A total of 19 seconds elapsed from the time of the initial call for backup to the time \u201cshots fired\u201d was first reported to dispatchers, Ravitch said. View as one page Prev 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 Next \n \n (page 6 of 7) Schemmel, a trainee who was at the wheel of the patrol car, was still getting into a defensive position when Gelhaus fired his weapon from behind an open passenger-side door, the report stated. Ravitch said she released a synopsis of the shooting inquiry to address public concerns about transparency. She described her investigation as a limited inquiry into criminal liability of the deputy. \u201cPolice tactics, training, and civil liability are not matters to be addressed by our office or this report,\u201d she said. The Sonoma County Grand Jury will receive the district attorney's full report and all exhibits, as well as the Santa Rosa Police Department's investigative reports. A copy of the report will also be sent to U.S. Department of Justice representatives at the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office which are involved in a federal civil rights review. The state Attorney General's Office declined to review the report because it found no conflict or other cause that called for an independent review, Ravitch said. Ravitch said she is aware the decision will not alleviate the pain felt by the Lopez family and others in the community. \u201cIt is incumbent upon us to move forward to address the many layers of concern uncovered by this tragedy, and work together to rebuild trust and support for all members of this community,\u201d she said in a statement. In a statement expressing sympathy for the Lopez family and friends and others involved in the incident, Freitas suggested one way the community could come together was to support legislation requiring imitation firearms such as the one Lopez was carrying be made of either brightly colored or translucent materials. California Senate Bill 199, co-authored by state Sen. Noreen Evans, D-Santa Rosa, would expand the federal law that requires imitation firearms be sold with an orange tip, a feature that had been removed from the gun Lopez was carrying when he was shot. View as one page Prev 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 Next \n \n (page 7 of 7) A section of the gun Lopez was carrying was made with translucent plastic, but the difference is difficult to notice at a distance. The new law would require enough translucent material to allow \u201cunmistakable observation of the device's complete contents,\u201d Freitas said. The sheriff said a review of deputy-involved shootings over the past 10 years \u2014 something he said he ordered in March 2013, before Lopez was shot \u2014 should be completed and made public by the end of the year. \u201cGoing forward, I am hopeful that through meaningful collaborative effort, we can assemble the building blocks of prevention, improved communication, and community trust and confidence in the Sheriff's Office and our staff,\u201d he said. On Monday, local law enforcement agencies were alerted that Ravitch was planning to announce her decision and told to prepare for a potential public response. Freitas and Schreeder said that deputies and officers were prepared to make sure demonstrators are safe and peaceful. \u201cWe will defend people's right to assemble, and arrest anyone who commits acts of vandalism and violence,\u201d Freitas said. Local political leaders, including Santa Rosa Mayor Scott Bartley, urged demonstrators to remain peaceful. Ravitch said the community would never again be the same. \u201cThe events of Oct. 22, 2013, are absolutely tragic,\u201d Ravitch said. \u201cA 13-year-old boy was killed by an experienced law enforcement officer. The loss of this young life under these circumstances is a loss for all of us. This community will be forever changed by what happened that afternoon.\u201d View as one page Prev 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 \n \n No criminal charges will be filed against a Sonoma County sheriff's deputy who shot and killed 13-year-old Andy Lopez last year as the boy walked down the street carrying an airsoft BB gun that resembled an AK-47 rifle, District Attorney Jill Ravitch announced Monday.

She called Gelhaus, who is out of the area on a prescheduled vacation, and said he was \u201cvery relieved.\u201d \u201cThis has been an extremely difficult time for Erick. He has certainly grieved for the Lopez family,\u201d Leoni said. \u201cIt hasn't been easy for him in terms of the media and public scrutiny but also for the loss of this child.\u201d Leoni said that she and her client had been \u201cin the dark\u201d throughout much of the investigation, although they cooperated by providing statements and information when needed. \u201cYou're always concerned whether the charging agency or District Attorney's Office is going to make the right choice, look at the law, apply the facts of the law,\u201d Leoni said. \u201cThere's always a concern that they will be swayed by the political aspects or mob mentality. We are glad the District Attorney's Office took (its) time.\u201d Santa Rosa Police Chief Hank Schreeder said that his officers didn't recommend an outcome when they handed their investigation to the District Attorney's Office on Jan. 29. \u201cThe District Attorney has to decide on the points of law. We are just the fact finders,\u201d Schreeder said. Ravitch, who has faced criticism over the length of her inquiry, called her review of the police investigation into the shooting \u201cexhaustive and thorough,\u201d resulting in reports that totaled more than 1,000 pages. District Attorney investigators responded to the scene Oct. 22 and worked alongside Santa Rosa police called in to investigate, with assistance from Petaluma police. Ravitch said she assigned an attorney and an investigator who both have significant homicide experience to conduct her office's review and ensure any additional investigative steps took place. She said she chose people who don't have longstanding ties to Sonoma County law enforcement to ensure neutrality. The bulk of their work began after receiving the Santa Rosa Police Department's report on the shooting. That report included interviews with about 200 witnesses, 200 hours of recorded interviews and 175 items of evidence, among other materials, Ravitch told reporters at the press conference Monday. The investigative team re-interviewed witnesses and spoke with a pathologist hired by the Lopez family who conducted an additional autopsy. They also consulted with numerous outside sources, including people with expertise in how people perform in high-stress encounters, and an weapons expert who estimated it would take two seconds to fire eight rounds with the type of gun Gelhaus used. The office even hired a company to do a 3D analysis of the trajectory of the eight shots Gelhaus fired. It concluded that the first shot likely missed Lopez, hitting a home behind him. The next one likely struck him in the upper left arm as he was \u201cdirectly facing\u201d the deputy, the report found. The remaining six shots probably hit him as he was turning, falling down or had hit the ground, the report found. A total of 19 seconds elapsed from the time of the initial call for backup to the time \u201cshots fired\u201d was first reported to dispatchers, Ravitch said. Schemmel, a trainee who was at the wheel of the patrol car, was still getting into a defensive position when Gelhaus fired his weapon from behind an open passenger-side door, the report stated. Ravitch said she released a synopsis of the shooting inquiry to address public concerns about transparency. She described her investigation as a limited inquiry into criminal liability of the deputy. \u201cPolice tactics, training, and civil liability are not matters to be addressed by our office or this report,\u201d she said. The Sonoma County Grand Jury will receive the district attorney's full report and all exhibits, as well as the Santa Rosa Police Department's investigative reports. A copy of the report will also be sent to U.S. Department of Justice representatives at the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office which are involved in a federal civil rights review. The state Attorney General's Office declined to review the report because it found no conflict or other cause that called for an independent review, Ravitch said. Ravitch said she is aware the decision will not alleviate the pain felt by the Lopez family and others in the community. \u201cIt is incumbent upon us to move forward to address the many layers of concern uncovered by this tragedy, and work together to rebuild trust and support for all members of this community,\u201d she said in a statement. In a statement expressing sympathy for the Lopez family and friends and others involved in the incident, Freitas suggested one way the community could come together was to support legislation requiring imitation firearms such as the one Lopez was carrying be made of either brightly colored or translucent materials. California Senate Bill 199, co-authored by state Sen. Noreen Evans, D-Santa Rosa, would expand the federal law that requires imitation firearms be sold with an orange tip, a feature that had been removed from the gun Lopez was carrying when he was shot. A section of the gun Lopez was carrying was made with translucent plastic, but the difference is difficult to notice at a distance. The new law would require enough translucent material to allow \u201cunmistakable observation of the device's complete contents,\u201d Freitas said. The sheriff said a review of deputy-involved shootings over the past 10 years \u2014 something he said he ordered in March 2013, before Lopez was shot \u2014 should be completed and made public by the end of the year. \u201cGoing forward, I am hopeful that through meaningful collaborative effort, we can assemble the building blocks of prevention, improved communication, and community trust and confidence in the Sheriff's Office and our staff,\u201d he said. On Monday, local law enforcement agencies were alerted that Ravitch was planning to announce her decision and told to prepare for a potential public response. Freitas and Schreeder said that deputies and officers were prepared to make sure demonstrators are safe and peaceful. \u201cWe will defend people's right to assemble, and arrest anyone who commits acts of vandalism and violence,\u201d Freitas said. Local political leaders, including Santa Rosa Mayor Scott Bartley, urged demonstrators to remain peaceful. Ravitch said the community would never again be the same. \u201cThe events of Oct. 22, 2013, are absolutely tragic,\u201d Ravitch said. \u201cA 13-year-old boy was killed by an experienced law enforcement officer. The loss of this young life under these circumstances is a loss for all of us. This community will be forever changed by what happened that afternoon.\u201d 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 \n \n Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. \n \n Disqus",

Deputy Erick Gelhaus \"fired his weapon in response to what he honestly and reasonably believed was an imminent threat of death,\" said Sonoma County DA Jill Ravitch of Andy Lopez's death. \"As such, he was lawfully acting in defense of himself or others.\" The finding followed a five-month investigation and protests around California, including a \"National Day of Action for Andy Lopez\" organized by a statewide group opposing police brutality, CBS San Francisco reports. Andy was walking through rural Sonoma County last October, holding a BB gun resembling an AK-47, when deputies on patrol saw him and told him to drop the weapon. Ten seconds later, Gelhaus had put seven bullets in the boy. \"The family and my office are greatly disappointed with the decision,\" said the Lopez family's attorney. \"If there was ever a case where charges were warranted, it was this one.\" But Ravitch said her office pored over more than 1,000 pages of reports and spoke to numerous experts to consider \"every interpretation of the facts.\" Now the Lopez family's civil suit, held up by the criminal probe, will \"have to run through the legal process,\" an official said.

    "document": "Although the risk of deadly shootings appears to have escalated, violence in the United States is trending downward. In 1995, there were 685 violent incidents per 100,000 people nationwide. By 2014, the national violent crime rate had fallen to 366 violent crimes per 100,000 people. The United States is far from the most peaceful place on earth, however, and some states remain far more violent than others. \n \n 24/7 Wall St. generated an index to rank the peacefulness of each U.S. state. States with high violent crime and homicide rates, as well as high estimated small arms ownership and high incarceration rates were identified as less peaceful, while states with lower incidences of these factors were more peaceful. According to our index, Maine is the most peaceful state, while Louisiana is the least peaceful. \n \n In an interview with 24/7 Wall St., Dr. Nancy La Vigne, director of the Urban Institute\u2019s Justice Policy Center, made clear that states are not simply violent, or peaceful. Rather, they fall onto a continuum. This is partially due to the fact that the concentration of violence varies so much geographically, even within states. \n \n Click here to see America\u2019s most violent (and peaceful) states. \n \n Click here to read our methodology. \n \n \u201cEven within cities that tend to have higher crime rates and even within neighborhoods that are well known to have lots of violent crime, there are pockets of peaceful streets and pockets of violent ones,\u201d La Vigne said. \n \n A slew of factors contribute to violence in a community. La Vigne noted that many factors are involved and anything from low incomes and the presence of 15 to 25 year old men to a combination of environmental conditions can help explain unrest in an area. \u201cVacant housing, burned out streetlights, [and] signs of disorder \u2026 can predict where crime might be more concentrated,\u201d she said. \n \n In the vast majority of the nation\u2019s more peaceful states, households earn higher incomes, while incomes tended to be much lower in more violent states. Of the 25 states on the top end of the peacefulness ranking, only five have poverty rates higher than the national rate of 15.5%. Of the more violent half of states, poverty rates tend to be higher. \n \n A perfectly peaceful community would have no need for weapons or law enforcement workers. Of course, some number of police officers are needed to keep the peace even in the least violent areas. Past a certain threshold, however, large enforcement operations are features of less peaceful states. The ratio of law enforcement employees to state residents exceeded the national proportion of 282 law enforcement workers per 100,000 Americans in eight of the 10 least peaceful states. On the other hand, all but two of the 10 most peaceful states had proportionately smaller police forces. \n \n The connection between law enforcement and peaceful society is not yet completely understood. Crime continued to drop in the United States during the most recent economic downturn, even as police spending dramatically fell. Also, whether more policing equals greater peace largely depends on what police are doing. La Vigne gave the example of aggressive stop-and-frisk tactics, which frequently alienate law-abiding citizens who might otherwise have aided in crime prevention. ||||| 10. Arizona \n \n > Violent crime rate: 399.9 per 100,000 (16th highest) \n \n > Murder and non-negligent manslaughter rate: 4.7 per 100,000 (20th highest) \n \n > Median household income: $50,068 (21st lowest) \n \n > June unemployment rate: 5.8% (9th highest) \n \n Arizona is the 10th least peaceful state in the nation. In addition to an above-average violent crime rate, the incidences of property crime, larceny, and motor vehicle theft in Arizona are each among the 10 highest compared with other states. So far this year, data collection and research group Gun Violence Archive has tracked four mass shootings in the state in which a total of 12 people were killed. Just seven other states have had a higher number of deaths from mass shootings. \n \n To contain such high levels of violence, Arizona needs to retain large law enforcement operations. For every 100,000 Arizona residents there are 339 law enforcement workers employed in the state. Also, 628 prisoners are held under state jurisdiction \u2014 the ninth and sixth highest numbers of all states. \n \n 9. South Carolina \n \n > Violent crime rate: 497.7 per 100,000 (7th highest) \n \n > Murder and non-negligent manslaughter rate: 6.4 per 100,000 (4th highest) \n \n > Median household income: $45,238 (9th lowest) \n \n > June unemployment rate: 5.4% (15th highest) \n \n Over the last five years, crime dropped by 100 incidents per 100,000 South Carolina residents, one of the best improvements of any state. Still, in a given year, nearly 500 violent crimes are reported per 100,000 people in the state, the seventh highest violent crime rate. The violent crime rates in all six South Carolina metro areas tracked by the FBI are well above the national violent crime rate. In the Sumter area, there are 666 violent crimes per 100,000 metro residents, one of the highest rates in the country. \n \n The presence of firearms not only tends to increase the likelihood of violence, but also may reflect the fear of those who possess firearms for self defense. South Carolina\u2019s gun ownership rate of 44.4% is well above the 29.1% of adults nationwide who say they live in a household with at least one firearm. \n \n 8. Florida \n \n > Violent crime rate: 540.5 per 100,000 (5th highest) \n \n > Murder and non-negligent manslaughter rate: 5.8 per 100,000 (7th highest) \n \n > Median household income: $47,463 (12th lowest) \n \n > June unemployment rate: 4.7% (25th highest) \n \n So far this year, 16 mass shootings have been documented in Florida. While this is less than in California and Illinois, the 131 people injured and 67 killed in these incidents are by far the highest of any state. The 50 people killed in Orlando in June dwarfs the death toll from mass shootings in any state in recent memory. \n \n Florida was not an especially safe state even before the shootings. The latest violent crime rate pegs Florida in fifth place, with 541 violent crimes reported per 100,000 people. The incidences of robbery, aggravated assault, and property crime are also each fifth highest compared with other states. \n \n 7. Missouri \n \n > Violent crime rate: 442.9 per 100,000 (11th highest) \n \n > Murder and non-negligent manslaughter rate: 6.6 per 100,000 (3rd highest) \n \n > Median household income: $48,363 (15th lowest) \n \n > June unemployment rate: 4.5% (23rd lowest) \n \n Missouri has one of the highest violent crime rates in the country and the third highest murder rate. The state\u2019s two largest metropolitan areas \u2014 Kansas City and St. Louis \u2014 appear to be driving these figures up, with rates of 482 and 430 incidents per 100,000 people, respectively. Ferguson, Missouri was also recently at the center of the debate about police violence against black Americans after an officer shot unarmed 18 year old Michael Brown. In March 2015, in light of the shooting and protests, the Federal Department of Justice sued the city, citing serious flaws in its policing practices. The lawsuit was resolved in March, with Ferguson agreeing to reform its criminal justice system. There are 335 law enforcement officials in Missouri for every 100,000 residents, the 10th highest share in the country. \n \n 6. Arkansas \n \n > Violent crime rate: 480.1 per 100,000 (9th highest) \n \n > Murder and non-negligent manslaughter rate: 5.6 per 100,000 (12th highest) \n \n > Median household income: $41,262 (3rd lowest) \n \n > June unemployment rate: 3.8% (13th lowest) \n \n A person who is either employed or actively seeking work is less likely to commit violent crimes than someone who is completely disengaged. In Arkansas, only 58.7% of the population participates in the labor force, one of the smallest shares of any U.S. state. A highly educated population also tends to be more peaceful. However, only 21.4% of Arkansas adults have a bachelor\u2019s degree, a smaller share than in all but two other states. \n \n With relatively weak workforce engagement as well as low educational attainment rates, Arkansas has one of the highest violent crime rates in the country. There are 480 violent crimes for every 100,000 state residents a year in Arkansas, far more than the national rate of 366 incidents per 100,000 people.",

I called for our boat which transfers our customers, but he kept firing toward the sea too. The boat couldn\u2019t approach,\u201d Yilan said. \n \n He spoke to Reuters at the funeral of his colleague, Fatih Cakmak, a security guard who worked at the club and had survived a suicide bombing targeting police at a soccer stadium a few kilometers away just three weeks earlier. \n \n \u201cISTANBUL\u2019S BEST NIGHT CLUB\u201d \n \n Lito German, 47, a Filipino living in Saudi Arabia who works in marketing, was in Istanbul for the first time with his wife and daughter and was approaching the club as the attack began. \n \n \u201cWe were about 100 metres away and started seeing people fleeing toward us. Most were very well dressed, though many were barefoot and looking shaken and scared,\u201d he said. \n \n \u201cWe were actually meant to go to another club, but we didn\u2019t want to be in a very big place due to security issues, and we found Reina by googling Istanbul\u2019s best night club. We thought the most expensive club would have better security.\u201d \n \n Men lay flowers outisde the Reina nightclub by the Bosphorus, which was attacked by a gunman, in Istanbul, Turkey, January 1, 2017. REUTERS/Umit Bektas \n \n Armored police vehicles rushed to the scene as more and more people came running out, he said. \n \n Among the dead were Abis Rizvi, 49, a Bollywood producer who was in the midst of making his second film, and Khushi Shah, a fashion designer in her 20s, both from Mumbai. The Indian government said it was making arrangements to help the families as they come to Turkey to collect the bodies. \n \n Lebanon sent a plane to carry back the remains of three of its citizens who were among the dead. \n \n Elias Wardini, 26, a personal trainer, had posted a picture on Instagram a few hours before the attack, posing in the Istanbul snow with another Lebanese victim in her twenties, Rita Shami. \n \n The club\u2019s owner, Mehmet Kocarslan, said police had taken extraordinary security measures in the run-up to the New Year in neighborhoods on the Bosphorus shore around Ortakoy. \n \n The U.S. embassy had warned of potential attacks on areas frequented by foreigners, but Kocarslan said there had been no specific threat against his club in particular and that many of the warnings had been country-wide. \n \n \u201cI really don\u2019t know how this demon, I can\u2019t even call him a terrorist, was able to reach here despite all this intelligence and extraordinary security measures,\u201d he said. \n \n The incident bore echoes of an attack by militant Islamists on Paris\u2019s Bataclan music hall in November 2015 that, along with assaults on bars and restaurants, killed 130 people. \n \n \u201cWhen they\u2019re determined, they\u2019re determined, and there\u2019s nothing to do,\u201d said Turk, who was visiting from France. \n \n \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that I won\u2019t be coming anymore. For me Turkey, Istanbul, is one of the nicest cities in the world and I will keep on coming again and again.\u201d",

    "document": "Story highlights Five Israeli soldiers killed in militant tunnel attack, IDF says \n \n The death toll in Gaza rises above 1,100, Palestinian health official says \n \n Netanyahu tells nation to prepare for \"protracted campaign\" in Gaza \n \n At least eight children killed at Gaza refugee camp, Gaza's Health Ministry says \n \n Despite calls for a new cease-fire, fighting intensified in Gaza on Monday and Tuesday morning, with Palestinians saying more than two dozen people died as rockets or mortars struck a refugee camp, a hospital and the center of Gaza City. \n \n Eighteen people died as powerful and continuous air strikes rained down on Gaza City early Tuesday morning, the Palestinian Health Authority reported. And the Israeli military reported that 10 of its soldiers were killed Monday. \n \n Al Aqsa TV reported that Israeli strikes hit the Ministry of Finance in western Gaza and the house of Ismail Haniyeh, a senior political leader of Hamas. A radio station run by Hamas was bombed. \n \n Ten people, including eight children, were killed Monday when shells hit a refugee camp near the beach in Gaza where parents went to celebrate Eid al-Fitr, a Muslim holiday that marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan, the Gaza Health Ministry said. \n \n The children were playing in the street near their homes when an explosion shook the ground. Holes as large as fists pockmarked a nearby building, and 10 people -- eight of them children -- were killed, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. \n \n JUST WATCHED Explosions, gunfire in Gaza fighting Replay More Videos ...

The channel blamed the carnage on an Israeli drone. \n \n Shifa Hospital had been hit, too. Two people there were injured, the ministry said. \n \n As before, Israel and Hamas accused each other of sending the bombs that killed people in Gaza. A short time later, Israel sent a text message to the media blaming Gaza \"terrorists\" for the attacks. \n \n \"In the blink of an eye,\" a father said, \"I found body parts and heads cut off, no arms, no legs. I started to collect limbs, heads I couldn't recognize, I couldn't recognize my own children.\" \n \n Though world leaders pleaded for a humanitarian cease-fire, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent a message on Israeli television Monday. \n \n \"We need to be prepared for a protracted campaign in Gaza,\" he said. \n \n Calling life under the threat of death \"inconceivable\" for Israel, Netanyahu said the military will not end its incursion into Gaza until it has destroyed tunnels Hamas is using to attack civilians outside Gaza. \n \n Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon said Israel will not negotiate while Hamas is still attacking. \"We will not hesitate to expand our operation,\" he said. \n \n Deaths in Israel, too \n \n Ten Israeli soldiers were killed Monday, according to the Israel Defense Forces. \n \n JUST WATCHED Israel: Hamas rocket hit Gaza hospital Replay More Videos ...

Israeli soldiers stopped the attempted attack, killing one of the attackers, the military said. \n \n One Israeli soldier died in combat in southern Gaza. And another four were killed and eight were injured by mortar fire near Beeri, close to the Israeli-Gaza border, the IDF said. \n \n Ashraf al-Qudra, spokesman for Gaza health ministry, said 1,101 people have been killed and more than 6,500 wounded in Gaza since the current conflict began. A total of 53 Israeli soldiers have died. \n \n The tunnels \n \n A central goal of Israel's military is to destroy tunnels that Hamas uses to smuggle weapons and launch attacks. \n \n CNN's \"New Day\" asked chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat what the purpose of the tunnels were. \n \n \"I know the situation is so much complex -- I'm not saying I know the picture as a whole,\" he responded. But, he said, Gaza is now like a burning building. \"We need to get the people out, and then we need to extinguish the fire, and then we sit down and talk.\" \n \n Erakat called for Israel to pull troops out of Gaza. \n \n Israel isn't acting in self-defense, he said. \"They're the occupying power. They should be responsible for the human lives there.\" \n \n Erakat said U.N. figures show \"90% of those killed are women and children.\" \n \n It was unclear what he was basing those figures on. The United Nations estimates that more than 70% of the Palestinians killed were civilians, including 226 youths and 117 women. More than 150 were members of armed groups, the United Nations says. \n \n UNICEF said Monday that about two-thirds of the children killed were 12 or younger. \n \n Israel blames Hamas for civilian deaths, saying militants encourage people to stay in their homes despite Israeli warnings that strikes are coming. Militants also use civilian facilities such as homes, schools, mosques and hospitals to launch attacks on Israeli civilians and store weapons. \n \n Calls, hopes for peace \n \n The Gaza crisis was discussed Monday in a joint call involving U.S. President Barack Obama. British Prime Minister David Cameron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. \n \n A statement from Cameron's office said the leaders agreed on \"the urgent need for a lasting ceasefire in Gaza and Israel, backing the efforts of the Egyptian government to achieve this.\" \n \n U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry returned to Washington after a trip to the Middle East and Paris, where he held discussions in an attempt to calm the violence. His efforts were criticized by Israeli media and Palestinian leaders. \n \n A spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Monday night that he was concerned the IDF had dropped leaflets in the northern Gaza Strip, warning thousands of residents to leave their homes and evacuate to Gaza City. If true, this would have a \"devastating humanitarian impact\" on Gaza residents, he said. \n \n At a midnight meeting, the U.N. Security Council proclaimed its support for \"a comprehensive peace based on the vision of a region where two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, live side by side in peace with secure and recognized borders as envisioned in Security Council resolution 1850 (2008) .\" \n \n That fell short of Palestinian Ambassador Riyad Mansour's desires. He wanted the body to pass a resolution calling for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. \n \n \"The equation is simple,\" Israeli Ambassador Ron Prosor said. \"When it is quiet in Israel, it will be quiet in Gaza.\" \n \n Obama had another phone conversation with Netanyahu on Sunday, reiterating concern about the rising Palestinian civilian deaths, Israeli deaths and the \"worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza.\" \n \n Photos: Photos: Israel-Gaza crisis Photos: Photos: Israel-Gaza crisis Israel-Gaza crisis \u2013 Palestinians in Gaza celebrate a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas on Tuesday, August 26.

    "document": "The largest living fish, whale sharks, may increasingly be using volcanic islands off the western coast of Europe as a new home as sea surface temperatures rise, researchers say. \n \n This finding could shed light on how climate change might alter the behavior of fish globally, the scientists added. \n \n The whale shark is a titan, known to reach up to 41.5 feet (12.65 meters) in length and 47,000 lbs. (21,500 kilograms) in weight, and some anecdotes suggest they can get even larger. Unlike predators such as great white sharks, whale sharks are gentle giants, using rows of their tiny teeth as a filter to strain out tiny creatures in the water for meals, just like the largest whales do. \n \n \"Whale sharks are the largest living fish, yet they are also very elusive,\" said lead study author Pedro Afonso, a marine and fisheries ecologist at the University of the Azores. \n \n Whale sharks prefer warm tropical waters that are 79 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit (26.5 to 30 degrees Celsius). However, in recent years, fishermen have increasingly sighted these giant fish around the Azores Islands, nine volcanic isles in the central North Atlantic west of Portugal. These islands lie along the colder northern edge of the waters that whale sharks historically have preferred. [Image Gallery: Mysterious Lives of Whale Sharks] \n \n To better understand why these gargantuan fish appear more often around the Azores, the scientists analyzed data on whale shark sightings gathered over 16 years, from 1998 to 2013, by observers on tuna fishing boats. Fishermen in the Azores have long detected tuna by looking for whale sharks, locally known as 'pintados' \u2014 Portuguese for \"spotted,\" referring to the sharks' spotted skin. \n \n \"They know that a whale shark will almost always carry a school of tuna underneath it,\" Afonso told Live Science. (It remains a mystery as to why tuna accompany whale sharks, he added.) \n \n Afonso noted \"there was no way we would get to know anything about whale shark occurrences\" without observers on these tuna fishing boats. The area in which the whale sharks are seen around the Azores \"is 1 million square kilometers [386,000 square miles], easy,\" Afonso said. \n \n The researchers used computer models to investigate the patterns of whale shark sightings over time and space, in relation to factors such as food, sea surface temperatures and seafloor features. The scientists found a sharp rise in whale shark sightings in the exceptionally warm year of 2008, and the giant fish became regular visitors to the region afterward. \n \n The scientists also found that sea surface temperatures helped predict whale shark sightings. For example, higher water temperatures around the southernmost Azores Island of Santa Maria were associated with more sightings of the fish. Observers also spotted the sharks more often in areas with underwater hills and mountains; these seafloor features coincide with large amounts of photosynthetic organisms that feed the creatures that the whale sharks eat. \n \n These findings are a window into what might happen as climate changes globally, the scientists said. \"Large marine animals such as the whale shark can change their oceanic distributions depending on regional conditions,\" Afonso said. \n \n Future research could investigate why whale sharks remain in this area during the summer. \"Is it only the food around the seamounts, or something else \u2014 maybe the presence of other whale sharks to mate with?\" Afonso said. \n \n Afonso and his colleagues Niall McGinty and Miguel Machete detailed their findings online today (July 16) in the journal PLOS ONE. \n \n Follow us @livescience, Facebook & Google+. Original article on Live Science. ||||| The reef manta ray, shown here, is among the world's largest fishes. Both it and the giant manta ray can grow several feet across. They are slow growing, however, typically giving birth to only one pup every two to three years. They are migratory and occur in small, highly fragmented populations that are sparsely distributed across the world\u2019s tropics. Manta rays are captured in targeted fisheries and incidentally as bycatch. In addition, manta rays are used for human consumption, shark bait, and -- as for devil rays -- are increasingly sought for their gill rakers. \"The international trade in shark and ray products, including fins, meat, and other body parts, is driving shark and ray fisheries around the world, and most of these are unmanaged or only minimally managed,\" said Dr. John Robinson, WCS's executive vice president for Conservation and Science. \"Lack of controls on fisheries and international trade puts species at risk, but also jeopardizes sustainable fisheries, ecosystems, and food security.\" The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora will meet in Thailand in March 2013. PHOTOS:Shark Teeth Weapons Reveal Surprises \n \n Many rays, such as these, are also in peril. The Wildlife Conservation Society and over 35 government agencies and NGO partners at the congress additionally highlighted population loss problems associated with so-called \"devil rays,\" which feed on planktonic crustaceans. Small schooling fishes become trapped on their specialized gill rakers. Rays are frequently captured in target fisheries and as bycatch across much of their range. One reason is that the gill rakers are dried and exported for the Asian medicinal market. \n \n Scalloped hammerhead sharks are endangered all around the globe. This tropical species forms large migratory schools at certain times of the year. The aggregating behavior, distinct from that of other sharks, makes the shark particularly vulnerable to fishing. \"We estimate that many millions of sharks are killed annually through both legal and illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing for the trade in fins, the prime ingredient in shark fin soup,\" said Dr. Rachel Graham, director of WCS's Gulf and Caribbean Sharks and Rays Program. \"The high price for fins has caused the global shark fishery to expand far beyond what is sustainable. The need for international regulation and enforcement has never been greater.\" Shark Paradise Found \n \n The oceanic whitetip shark is critically endangered in the Northwest and Central Atlantic Ocean. It's frequently sought after for its fins, used to make shark fin soup. Usually the rest of the dead or dying shark is then tossed back into the sea. Andrew Brierley, a University of St. Andrews marine ecologist, told Discovery News that when sharks like this die off, the deaths can cause a domino effect of other ecosystem losses. Shellfish, for example, may go into decline because they are consumed more by predators that the sharks would normally prey upon. \"The trophic cascade brought about by the increasing demand for shark fin soup has not only left once economically valuable bivalve fisheries in crisis, but has precipitated an ecological and culinary bankruptcy,\" explained Brierley. \n \n -- Five rays and sharks are receiving priority attention at this week's IUCN World Conservation Congress held in Jeju, Republic of Korea. The congress is the world's largest conservation event. One of the five sharks is the porbeagle, shown here. Porbeagles are vulnerable globally, and are classified as critically endangered in the Northeast Atlantic. Their low reproductive capacity combined with over-fishing has led to severe population declines over several parts of its range. \"Sharks and rays have traveled the Earth for more than 400 million years,\" said Dr. Cristi\u00e1n Samper, president and CEO of the Wildlife Conservation Society and keynote speaker at the Jeju congress. \"Yet, in only recent decades, many of these species have become threatened from overfishing and, in some instances, have disappeared entirely from major portions of their range.\" He added, \"The potential loss of one of only two groups of the world's living fishes is a crisis the world community must take decisive action to address. We are calling for governments around the world to vigorously support CITES international trade regulations and strengthen fisheries management and protection measures for shark and ray species. We cannot continue to allow the destruction of these wonders of evolution.\" Manta Rays Fate Worse Than Sharks \n \n Whale sharks are flocking to waters off of the Azore islands, a Portuguese archipelago in the North Atlantic Ocean, a new study has found. \n \n Whale sharks tend to enjoy warmer temperatures, but even this species has been affected by climate change, according to the study, which is published in the latest issue of the journal PLoS ONE. \n \n It appears to be a Goldilocks effect where the sharks prefer temperatures that aren\u2019t too hot or too cold. Things must be just right \u2014 at least for the momen t\u2013 in the Azores, which is becoming whale shark central. \n \n 5 Sharks, Rays Needing Urgent Protection: Photos \n \n Pedro Afonso of the University of the Azores and his colleagues wrote that the \u201coccurrence of the whale shark in the wider Azores region increased drastically in 2008. Prior to this, and for a full decade, these large animals had only been sighted sporadically,\u201d but the sharks keep coming. \n \n Whale sharks, the world\u2019s largest sharks, are slow-moving filter feeders known for their large mouths. They usually inhabit tropical and warm-temperate seas, preferring temperatures from 78.8 degrees Fahrenheit to 86 degrees. \n \n In Portugal, the authors note that \u201cwhale sharks \u2014 local name \u2018pintados\u2019 \u2014 are known by Azorean fishermen to sometimes occur during the summer and associate with tuna, and have been used for a long time as an aid to locating and fishing the tuna schools.\u201d \n \n But the sharks have been coming even more often than that, to the point that \"whale shark watching\" tourism has become a growing business in the region. \n \n The researchers analyzed a 16-year (1998-2013) observer data set from tuna fishermen around the region. They also used models to investigate the movement of the sharks in relation to factors such as food, sea surface temperature and seafloor features. \n \n Photos: Shark Paradise Found \n \n Since 2008, whale shark presence around the Azores has been steadily increasing, which appears to coincide with water temperature changes. \n \n Usually the Azores fall into the colder side of the sharks\u2019 preferred range, but water temperature rises at this location are proving to be a draw for sharks. Conversely, temperatures that are too hot or too cold in other spots are becoming less desirable for them. \n \n The temperature increase in the Azores correlated with larger amounts of chlorophyll \u2014 a, a type of whale shark food. \n \n The researchers also found that whale shark populations are higher in areas of increased seafloor slope and closer to seamounts. That\u2019s because these regions tend to be richer in chlorophyll-a. \n \n \u201cOur findings underline the potential for an increase of the wider Azores region\u2019s importance as an oceanic habitat for the whale shark in the North Atlantic in years of exceptionally high water temperature, and for a concomitant shift in the whale shark distribution within the Atlantic Ocean, as predicted by global modeling studies,\u201d Afonso and his team concluded. \n \n \u201cIn the future, such shifts need to be placed in the context of decadal and very long-term changes in this ocean.\u201d \n \n Photo: A whale shark.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Some of Syria's most powerful rebel groups have disavowed the Western-backed National Syrian Coalition's government in exile, in a move that may further complicate efforts to find a diplomatic resolution to the country's civil war. Thirteen groups, spearheaded by the al-Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra Front, released a statement last night declaring that the newly-formed interim government \"does not represent or recognize us\" and urging their fellow rebels to make Sharia law \"the sole source of legislation.\" Three of the signatories control large amounts of territory, CNN reports. The jihadis aren't the only ones dismissing the opposition government, either. Syria's deputy foreign minister yesterday dismissed the coalition as having little influence, the New York Times reports. He further dimmed the prospect of peace talks by saying the regime wouldn't negotiate with anyone who'd taken up arms against it, though it might talk to religious leaders \"who have influence on the ground.\" Russia, meanwhile, said a peace deal could only be reached if the US stopped calling for Bashar al-Assad's ouster, Reuters reports.",

Even before the proceedings wrapped up, they began spreading the word that Obama\u2019s solicitor general, Donald Verrilli, had seemed ill-prepared and incapable of defending the law against an onslaught of pointed questions from skeptical justices, and that the critical swing voter on the court \u2013 Anthony Kennedy \u2013 had all but stated that he considers the mandate unconstitutional. \n \n CNN\u2019s Jeffrey Toobin branded the proceedings \u201ca train wreck for the Obama administration\u201d and predicted that \u201cthis law looks like it\u2019s going to be struck down,\u201d while Mother Jones\u2019 Adam Serwer declared on Twitter that \u201cIf the justices decided the constitutionality of laws on performance, Obamacare would go down like a flaming zeppelin.\u201d Mike Sacks of the Huffington Post said that opposition to the law seemed \u201calmost unequivocal\u201d from Kennedy, whom Toobin called a \u201clost cause\u201d for the administration. \n \n It\u2019s worth keeping in mind that all of this alarmism may well amount to nothing. \n \n The stakes of this case and the court\u2019s notorious opacity encourage tea leaf-reading and overreaction. It\u2019s clear from objective reports from inside the court that the administration was repeatedly put on the defensive by Kennedy, Antonin Scalia, Samuel Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts. Along with Clarence Thomas, who rarely speaks but almost always sides with his fellow Republican-appointed justices, they form the court\u2019s conservative majority \u2013 with Kennedy the most likely to break ranks.

And don't be shocked if John Roberts ends up agreeing with him, he adds. \"The court isn\u2019t expected to rule for months, maybe not until late June,\" adds Kornacki in his post. \"It\u2019s entirely possible that the mandate will be thrown out, but it\u2019s all still guesswork until then.\" Read his full column here.

    "document": "Update, 9:04 a.m., June 22, 2016 \n \n \n \n 'It's been hell,' says Baton Rouge mom jailed for allegedly beating sons after catching them burglarizing home \n \n Original story: \n \n A Baton Rouge mother who caught her three sons breaking into a residence was arrested Tuesday after she whipped them as a punishment, East Baton Rouge deputies said. \n \n But the decision to jail 30-year-old Schaquana Evita Spears on child cruelty counts was questioned by the local district attorney and scolded by strangers as far away as California, prompting a debate about where to draw the line between well-meaning discipline and child abuse. \n \n Even Lisa Nicholson, the 45-year-old neighbor who said it was her house that was burglarized by Spears\u2019 children, said she thought the single mother of six should be commended, not arrested. Though she wasn\u2019t home at the time of the break-in, Nicholson said that as the homeowner she could have had killed the boys out of panic when they busted her back window. \n \n \u201cIf it was me,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m gonna beat you before I let the cops kill you. I\u2019m gonna do what I have to do. I\u2019m not gonna let (my children) steal and kill and do all of that. I\u2019m not gonna let them fall victim to the streets.\u201d \n \n Not seeing the video below? Click here. \n \n Spears, who has worked as a cook and opened a small catering business, admitted she hit her three sons \u2014 ages 10, 12 and 13 \u2014 after she caught them breaking into the residence near her house at 5470 Satinwood Drive on Friday, according to a Sheriff\u2019s Office report. \n \n Her 13-year-old son, interviewed by child services officials at the juvenile detention center, told authorities Spears struck him multiple times with an RCA cord. RCA cables are used to connect devices like VCRs and DVD players to TV sets or CD players to stereo receivers. \n \n He had lacerations to both of his arms and marks across his leg, shoulder, back and stomach, causing some bleeding, the report says. \n \n Juvenile justice officials said they could not reveal why the son was at the juvenile facility. \n \n The other two boys also had some injuries, with the 12-year-old showing cuts on his arm and the youngest child receiving a small scratch to the hand, according to the document. Spears was accused of two counts of cruelty to juveniles. \n \n \u201cSurely you would expect a parent to discipline a child who is burglarizing other people\u2019s homes as this could be a deadly encounter for the child,\u201d said East Baton Rouge Parish District Attorney Hillar C. Moore III, whose office would handle Spears\u2019 criminal charges, if they are prosecuted. \n \n Moore said Spears\u2019 case is being reviewed, including the seriousness of the boys\u2019 injuries. He noted she has no prior convictions. \n \n Spears\u2019 criminal history includes a theft count in 2008 which was dismissed, according to court records. \n \n In the Friday incident, her sons stole a hoverboard, electronics and socks from Nicholson\u2019s house, and Spears immediately ordered the boys to return the items, Nicholson said. The goods belonged to Nicholson\u2019s 13-year-old son, Trayquan, who said some but not all of his belongings have been returned. \n \n \u201cWe oftentimes see children who have no parental authority or discipline which eventually results in delinquency and criminal acts,\u201d Moore said. \u201cWe need more parents who discipline their children.\u201d \n \n Glenn Nettles, 53, came by Spears\u2019 empty house Tuesday to see if his friend was inside. Nettles said Spears called him from jail, telling him her children were now being cared for by her mother, who lives out of town. He said he believes Spears\u2019 13-year-old is her eldest. \n \n \u201cShe loves her kids. She don\u2019t beat her kids,\u201d Nettles said, noting the distinction, echoed by Nicholson, between \u201cbeating,\u201d abuse that might involve chains and fists, and \u201cwhupping,\u201d which he said is an acceptable form of punishment. \n \n \u201cEverybody \ufffd?whup\u2019 their kids,\u201d he said. \u201cThey do something wrong. What are you supposed to do?\u201d \n \n Nettles said he used to train Spears when they worked in the kitchen at the Hilton Garden Inn, calling her a \u201creal sweet\u201d person. \n \n A Facebook page that appears to belong to Spears shows a business card for \u201cMyHeartInIt Catering & Creationz,\u201d listing her name and address. The profile includes many pictures of elaborate culinary spreads, some with pineapples sprouting from towers of fruit. \n \n No one answered the door at her one-story house on Tuesday. A toddler\u2019s toy scooter was the only vehicle outside. \n \n Casey Rayborn Hicks, spokeswoman for the East Baton Rouge Sheriff\u2019s Office, said she was unable to comment on the criticisms of Spears\u2019 arrest. \n \n An online article in The Advocate about Spears on Tuesday drew some 1,200 comments by that night, as well as at least one donation pledge from a stranger in Oakland, California. \n \n Louis Villa, 83, called the paper asking where he could pay Spears\u2019 $2,500 bail. \n \n \u201cI had a single parent, and hey, she had to discipline us. Yeah, I got hit by an ironing cord, but it made me a better person. It saved my life,\u201d Villa said, adding he imagined Spears might be like his mother: a single black mom who might not have the support she needs. \n \n \u201cShe explained why she had to hit us, why she had to discipline us, why we had to be home at a certain time,\u201d Villa said. \u201cIt just is not easy for black women in America.\u201d \n \n Nettles said an acquaintance who works as a lawyer is trying to help Spears post bail.

Welfare chief, attorney for arrested Baton Rouge mom differ on what constitutes child abuse \n \n The way to tell when disciplining a child has gone too far is when a child is left bleeding or with cuts, burns or bruises, the state\u2019s top child welfare official said Thursday. \n \n Department of Children and Family Services Secretary Marketa Garner Walters said in a statement that she felt \u201ccompelled to address a question many are asking\u201d about child abuse but didn\u2019t specify any particular case she was addressing. \n \n \u201cReasonable, constructive discipline is a healthy part of parenting and an essential element of child rearing, but it crosses into abuse when it leaves a child cut, burned, bloody or bruised. We\u2019re referring to something more than a mere \u2018spanking,\u2019 \u201d she said. \n \n The statement comes amid a controversy over the arrest Tuesday of Schaquana Evita Spears, a 30-year-old Baton Rouge mother booked on two counts of cruelty to juveniles after she admitted to striking three of her sons with a cord, leaving two of them with cuts and one bloodied. She said she \u201cwhipped\u201d the children after she found out they broke a neighbor\u2019s window and stole some $1,700 worth of equipment, including a hoverboard, video game systems, a computer and other items, according to an East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office report. \n \n Spears, who was released late Tuesday night after a judge reduced her bail, attracted defenders from across the country, including state Treasurer John Kennedy, who wrote an open letter to Walters calling for leniency on Spears. \n \n \u201cIf you are planning to keep or take these children away from their mother simply because she disciplined them for stealing, that would be a ludicrous step to take,\u201d Kennedy wrote in the letter. \n \n \u201cIn biblical times, sparing the rod led to a spoiled child. In modern times, sparing the rod leads to an imprisoned child,\u201d he wrote. \n \n Spears, a single parent, said Wednesday she is working to regain custody of her six children, who are being cared for by their grandmother. Spears did not respond to a query Thursday. \n \n \u201cWe are terribly upset she was arrested in the first place,\u201d said Spears\u2019 attorney, Brenden Craig. \u201cWe think the arresting agency would have been better served taking more time to investigate. I suggest they could have applied for a warrant, but they didn\u2019t do that. They slapped the cuffs on her.\u201d \n \n Casey Rayborn Hicks, spokeswoman for the Sheriff\u2019s Office, the agency that arrested Spears, said she does not have a response. \n \n Craig said just because Spears\u2019 children had cuts or were bleeding does not mean his client is guilty of a crime. \n \n \u201cShe was doing everything a mother should do,\u201d he said, adding that his client loves her children. \u201cWhat occurred did not constitute abuse.\u201d \n \n Craig said he could not comment on the custody status of Spears\u2019 children. \n \n Walters said the Department of Children and Family Services encourages anyone with questions about child development and appropriate discipline to call Prevent Child Abuse Louisiana\u2019s \u201cKidline\u201d at ( 800) CHILDREN, which is available from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily. ||||| Mom thought she was doing the right thing when she whipped kids who broke into home \n \n BATON ROUGE - A Baton Rouge mother who was arrested by East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's deputies after she admitted to whipping her sons as punishment for breaking into a house has bonded out of jail. She told our cameras she thought she was doing the right thing by disciplining her children. \n \n 30-year-old Schaquana Spears was booked on child cruelty charges Monday morning. \n \n The arrest reports says her 13-year-old reportedly told East Baton Rouge Sheriff\u2019s Office detectives that Spears had struck him with an RCA cord multiple times. The boy had cuts on both arms and marks across his body, according to investigators. \n \n The other two boys, aged 10 and 12, also had injuries, according to arrest documents. \n \n Spears was booked into the parish prison on two counts of cruelty to juveniles with bond set at $2,500. \n \n District Attorney Hillar Moore released a statement about the incident: \n \n \"Parents have the right and obligation to discipline and teach their children. We often time see children who have no parental authority or discipline which eventually results in delinquency and criminal acts. We need more parents who discipline their children. Surely you would expect a parent to discipline a child who is burglarizing other people\u2019s homes as this could be a deadly encounter for the child. The degree of physical discipline will be reviewed. The law does not allow excessive pain or cruelty but does allow physical parental discipline. I only have the short synopsis which does indicate that the discipline resulted in marks on the child\u2019s body and possibly an open wound. I will review all of the reports; meet with the DCFS office and review any history of this mother and her children to get a better picture of the entire family dynamics before making a decision. In the meantime my office is working with the juvenile court to ensure the speedy release of the mother under conditions satisfactory to the court.\" \n \n News 2's Brett Buffington was there when Spears bonded out of jail Tuesday night. \n \n \"They're just being kids, being followers,\" Spears said. \"I thought I was showing them this is not what you do. You do not steal people's stuff, what they work hard for. I know how that feels, I've had my house broken into.\" \n \n She told News 2 that someone saw her story on TV and showed up to post her bond for her. \n \n Multiple crowdfunding campaigns appeared in the mid-morning hours of Wednesday on sites like GoFundMe and Plumfund. The GoFundMe account had garnered more than $700 in donations as of 11 a.m. with the stated aim being \"to find suitable care for her children during the summer (if she needs it).\" Just 20 minutes later that campaign was no longer active. News 2 has reached out to the creators of the donation campaigns but have not received a reply at the time of this writing. ||||| An RCA connector, sometimes called a phono connector or (in other languages) Cinch connector, is a type of electrical connector commonly used to carry audio and video signals. The name RCA derives from the Radio Corporation of America, which introduced the design by the early 1940s for internal connection of the pickup to the chassis in home radio-phonograph consoles. It was originally a low-cost, simple design, intended only for mating and disconnection when servicing the console. Refinement came with later designs, although they remained compatible. \n \n RCA connectors began to replace the older quarter-inch phone connectors for many other applications in the consumer audio world when component high-fidelity systems started becoming popular in the 1950s. However, quarter-inch phone connectors are still common in professional audio, while miniature phone connectors (3.5 mm) predominated in personal stereo systems. \n \n The connection's plug is called an RCA plug or phono plug, for \"phonograph.\" The name \"phono plug\" is sometimes confused with a \"phone plug\" which may refer to a quarter-inch \"phone plug\" \u2013 Tip/Sleeve (TS) or Tip/Ring/Sleeve (TRS) connector \u2013 or to a 4P4C connector used for a telephone (which is often, though incorrectly, called \"RJ9\", \"RJ10\", or \"RJ22\"). \n \n Origin [ edit ] \n \n The back of an RCA AM radio from the 1940s with RCA connector for adding a turntable. Tag around connector reads \"An inexpensive RCA Victor record player will make a fine Victrola of this radio. Plug here.\" \n \n The word phono in phono connector is an abbreviation of the word phonograph, because this connector was originally created to allow the connection of a phonograph turntable to a radio receiver, using the radio as an amplifier. This setup was present in most radios manufactured in the 1930s onward by the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), who later marketed a special turntable for 45 RPM records, the model 9JY.[1] \n \n Phono input [ edit ] \n \n A \"phono input\" is a set of input jacks, usually RCA jacks, located on the rear panel of a preamp, mixer or amplifier, especially on early radio sets, to which a phonograph or turntable is attached. Modern styli (phonograph needles) and phono cartridges give a very low level output signal of the order of a few millivolts which the circuitry amplifies and equalizes. \n \n Phonograph recordings are made with high frequencies boosted and the low frequencies attenuated: during playback the frequency response changes are reversed. This reduces background noise, including clicks or pops, and also conserves the amount of physical space needed for each groove, by reducing the size of the larger low-frequency undulations. This is accomplished in the amplifier with a phono input that incorporates standardized RIAA equalization circuitry. \n \n Through at least the 1980s, the phono input was widely available on consumer stereo equipment\u2014even some larger boomboxes had them. By the 2000s only very sophisticated and expensive stereo receivers retained the phono input, since most users were expected to use digital music formats such as CD or satellite radio. Some newer low-cost turntables include built-in amplifiers to produce line-level (one volt) outputs; devices are available that perform this conversion for use with computers; or older amplifiers or radio receivers can be used. Nearly all DJ mixers have two or more phono inputs, together with two or more one-volt line inputs that also use RCA connectors. \n \n This \"phono input\" designed for the millivolt signal from an unamplified turntable should not be confused with the modern standard one-volt line input and output that also uses RCA connectors and is found on video cameras, recorders and similar modern equipment. \n \n Other uses [ edit ] \n \n RCA sockets, or jacks, here used for YPbPr video output. \n \n In the most normal use, cables have a standard plug on each end, consisting of a central male connector, surrounded by a ring. The ring is often segmented to provide spring gripping pressure when mated. Devices mount the socket (female jack), consisting of a central hole with a ring of metal around it. The ring is slightly larger in diameter and longer than the ring on the plug, allowing the plug's ring to fit tightly over it. The jack has a small area between the outer and inner rings which is filled with an insulator, typically plastic (very early versions, or those made for use as RF connectors, used ceramic). \n \n The connector was initially used for audio signals. As with many other connectors, the RCA has been adopted for other uses than originally intended, including as a DC power connector, an RF connector, and as a connector for loudspeaker cables. Its use as a connector for composite video signals is extremely common, but provides poor impedance matching.[2] RCA connectors and cable are also commonly used to carry S/PDIF-formatted digital audio, with plugs colored orange to differentiate them from other typical connections. \n \n Connections are made by pushing the cable's plug into the female jack on the device. The signal-carrying pin protrudes from the plug, and often comes into contact with the socket before the grounded rings meet, resulting in loud hum or buzz if the audio components do not share a common ground and are powered while making connections. Continuous noise can occur if the plug partially falls out of the jack, breaking the ground connection but not the signal. Some variants of the plug, especially cheaper versions, also give very poor grip and contact between the ground sheaths due to their lack of spring action. \n \n They are often color-coded, yellow for composite video, red for the right audio channel, and white or black for the left channel of stereo audio. This trio (or pair) of jacks can be found on the back of almost all audio and video equipment. One or more sets are often found on TV sets to facilitate connection of camcorders, other portable video sources and video game consoles.[3] Although nearly all connectors, including analog and S/PDIF audio as well as composite and component video, can use identical 75 \u03a9 cables, sales of special-purpose cables for each use have proliferated. Varying cable quality means that a cheap line-level audio cable might not successfully transfer component video. For digital audio, as long as a connection is successfully made using the cables the sound will remain faithful to the original signal because a digital signal can only be fully received or not received at all. Cables should meet the S/PDIF specification as defined by the international standard IEC 60958-3 for assured performance. \n \n The male plug has a center pin which is 3.175 mm (1/8 inch) in diameter, and is surrounded by an outer shell which is 8.25 mm (1/3 inch) in diameter. \n \n Disadvantages [ edit ] \n \n \"Bullet plug\" variation \u2013 Note the hollow center conductor and the pin point for the return signal. \n \n One problem with the RCA connector is that, when connecting the male into the female, the inner 'hot' (signal) connection is made before the 'cold' (ground) connection has been guaranteed; this often produces a loud buzz. Another problem with the RCA connectors is that each signal requires its own plug. Even the simple case of attaching a cassette deck may need four of them, two for stereo input and two for stereo output. In any common setup this quickly leads to a disarray of cables and confusion in how to connect them, which is made worse if one considers more complex signals like component video (a total of three for video and two for analog audio or one for digital coaxial audio). \n \n There have been attempts to introduce combined audio/video connectors for direct signals, but in the analog realm none of these has ever become common, with the exception of Europe where the SCART connector was very successful.[4] For a time the 5-pin DIN connector was popular for bi-directional stereo connection between A/V equipment, but it has been entirely displaced on modern consumer devices. Though RF modulators inherently transmit combined A/V signals in video applications, they depend on broadcast television systems and RF connectors which are not universal worldwide; RF signals are also generally inferior to direct signals due to protocol conversion and the RF limitations of the three major analog TV systems (NTSC, PAL and SECAM). \n \n Before HD television became a standard, nearly all TV sets, VCRs, and DVD players sold in Europe had SCART connectors,[4] although these are sometimes supplemented by RCA and/or RF connectors. SCART-RCA adapters also exist, which usually allow input of composite video and stereo audio.[5] Outside Europe, separate RCA connectors are usually used,[citation needed] supplemented by RF connectors for backward compatibility and simplicity. Although mini-DIN connectors are used for S-Video connections, composite video, component video, and analog audio (mono or stereo) all use RCA connectors unless the signals are sent via SCART. In the digital realm, however, combined A/V connectors are gaining ground; HDMI is commonly used today for consumer electronics, and DisplayPort, a potential competitor to HDMI, is often found on home computers and peripherals. \n \n The \"hot\" signal wire and signal ground provided by an RCA connection implement an unbalanced connection. A true balanced connection is generally preferred in certain applications, particularly professional settings, because it allows for the use of long cables while reducing susceptibility to external noise. \n \n Color coding in consumer equipment [ edit ] \n \n Plugs and sockets on consumer equipment are conventionally color-coded to aid correct connections. The standard[6] colors for the various signals are shown below; however, beyond 7.1 audio, the standard has degraded to a more general white/yellow, red/blue, and green/yellow color scheme for each cable respectively. \n \n Stereo audio applications use either black and red, grey and red or white and red RCA connectors; in all three cases, red denotes right. White or purple may also be replaced by black. Some older tape recorders, and equipment like receivers designed to connect to them, use a 5-pin DIN connector to connect left and right for record and playback with a single cable. Adapters between this connector and RCA connectors have used white and red for left and right channel recording, and blue (or sometimes black) and yellow for playback, but this is not universal. Most modern equipment with RCA connectors for recording devices simply uses white and red for all stereo pairs, whether record or playback. \n \n While these are the standard colors found on commercially made products, cables with different-colored connectors may be used, as long as the cable itself is compatible with the application (for example, cables with 75 ohms impedance for video and SPDIF). \n \n Composite analog video Composite Yellow Analog audio Left/Mono (record if 4 connector tape cable) White Right (record if 4 connector tape cable) Red Left tape (play if 4 connector tape cable) Black Right tape (play if 4 connector tape cable) Yellow Center Green Left surround Blue Right surround Grey Left back surround Brown Right back surround Tan Subwoofer Purple Digital audio S/PDIF Orange Component analog video (YP B P R ) Y Green P B /C B Blue P R /C R Red Component analog video/VGA (RGB/HV) R Red G Green B Blue H (Horizontal sync)/S(Composite Sync) Yellow V (Vertical sync) White \n \n See also [ edit ]",

But nobody had been talking about him for 2016, and he has quite deliberately set out to change that with a string of interviews. \n \n \u201cI didn\u2019t want any misinformation that I\u2019ve told people I\u2019m running\u2014that\u2019s not the case,\u201d Huckabee told me yesterday. \u201cI wanted to be honest and say, sure I\u2019m looking at it.\u201d \n \n Once Huckabee started having meetings with potential donors and supporters, including some who haven\u2019t backed him before, talking to the press was \u201cjust a matter of trying to shoot straight with people,\u201d he says. \n \n A major question for the former Arkansas governor is whether to give up his lucrative Fox perch\u2014a decision that loomed large as he agonized about whether to jump into the last campaign\u2014along with his radio commentaries. \n \n Huckabee would have to leave the Fox payroll if he started taking serious steps toward the Republican primaries, such as forming an exploratory committee and raising money. That\u2019s what happened with Fox contributors Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum in the 2012 cycle. \n \n He is very mindful of the prospect of having \u201czero income,\u201d Huckabee told me, \u201cunlike Senate candidates who continue to get a paycheck even if they\u2019re not showing up for work. I emptied out the treasury when I ran in 2008 and cashed in everything I could cash in.\u201d \n \n The other overriding question hanging over a Huckabee candidacy is the same one he wrestled with last time: could he raise enough money to be competitive? Huckabee ran a shoestring campaign in \u201908, when he was initially written off by the press until winning the Iowa caucus, and doesn\u2019t want to be the poverty candidate again. \n \n In a coordinated effort to raise his potential presidential profile, Huckabee granted three interviews at week\u2019s end to show the media that he should be in the mix. \n \n With Jonathan Martin in the New York Times: \n \n \u201cFormer Gov.

Indeed, he is brandishing polling that shows him leading in Iowa and South Carolina. \n \n But Huckabee noticed that all the chatter is about Chris Christie and Rand Paul and Jeb Bush and Scott Walker and others, and wants to keep his name in the mix to preserve his options. \n \n Does his Fox platform help keep him in the public eye? Of course. The same was true of Gingrich and Santorum, and Sarah Palin when she pondered a run. \n \n But if he can\u2019t raise many millions of dollars, he will run out of gas after the early contests, as he did against John McCain. \n \n Huckabee is a guy who doesn\u2019t have to be president, and he was reluctant to give up his Fox salary as he weighed the race in 2011. \n \n As he told me then, \u201cI\u2019m not a megalomaniac. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the only person who can save America. I wouldn\u2019t vote for someone who was that full of themselves. It\u2019s a dangerous thing to have someone in a public office who believes he is not a public servant, he is the messiah.\u201d \n \n For now, Huckabee is candid in saying that yakking in front of a microphone is far easier than actually governing. And that viewers aren\u2019t the same as voters. \n \n \u201cA lot of people like Jay Leno,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t see a Leno-for-president campaign going on.\u201d \n \n An Iowa Poll Now? \n \n An absurdly early Des Moines Register poll out yesterday backs up Huckabee\u2019s point. \n \n Paul Ryan (now under fire on the right for the bipartisan budget deal he brokered with Patty Murray) has a 73 percent approval rating among Iowa Republicans, the survey says.

Bizjet, meaning \u2014 yes \u2014 a small plane used for business, would be worth a whopping 120 points on an opening play, but only if it's made into a plural with an s. That's due to the 50-point bonus for using all seven tiles and the double word bonus space usually played at the start. \n \n The Springfield, Massachusetts-based dictionary company sought counsel from the North American Scrabble Players Association when updating the book, Sokolowski said, \"to make sure that they agree these words are desirable.\" \n \n Sokolowski has a favorite among the new words but not, primarily, because of Scrabble scores. \"It's macaron,\" he said, referring to the delicate French sandwich cookie featuring different flavors and fillings. \n \n \"I just like what it means,\" he said. \n \n Merriam-Webster put out the first official Scrabble dictionary in 1976. Before that, the game's rules called for any desk dictionary to be consulted. Since an official dictionary was created, it has been updated every four to eight years, Sokolowski said. \n \n There are other new entries Sokolowski likes, from a wordsmith's view. \n \n \"I think ew is interesting because it expresses something new about what we're seeing in language, which is to say that we are now incorporating more of what you might call transcribed speech. Sounds like ew or mm-hmm, or other things like coulda or kinda. Traditionally, they were not in the dictionary but because so much of our communication is texting and social media that is written language, we are finding more transcribed speech and getting a new group of spellings for the dictionary,\" he said. \n \n Like ew, there's another interjection now in play, yowza, along with a word some might have thought was already allowed: zen. \n \n There's often chatter around Scrabble boards over which foreign words have been accepted into English to the degree they're playable. Say hello to schneid, another of the new kids, this one with German roots. It's a sports term for a losing streak. Other foreigners added because they predominantly no longer require linguistic white gloves, such as italics or quotation marks: bibimbap, cotija and sriracha. \n \n Scrabble was first trademarked as such in 1948, after it was thought up under a different name in 1933 by Alfred Mosher Butts, an out-of-work architect in Poughkeepsie, New York. Interest in the game picked up in the early 1950s, according to legend, when the president of Macy's happened upon it while on vacation. \n \n Now, the official dictionary holds more than 100,000 words. Other newcomers Sokolowski shared are aquafaba, beatdown, zomboid, twerk, sheeple, wayback, bokeh, botnet, emoji, facepalm, frowny, hivemind, puggle and nubber. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

    "document": "NHK, Japan\u2019s public broadcaster, flashed instructions to evacuees: close doors and windows; place a wet towel over the nose and mouth; cover up as much as possible. At a news conference, Mr. Edano called for calm. \u201cIf measures can be taken, we will be able to ensure the safety of the reactor,\u201d he said. \n \n One result of the venting may have been setting off an explosion, caused by either steam or hydrogen, that tore the outer wall and roof off the building housing reactor No. 1, although the steel containment of the reactor remained in place, officials said. \n \n Even before the statement on Sunday by Mr. Edano, it was clear form radioactive materials turning up in trace amounts outside the reactors that fuel damage had occurred. The existence or extent of melting might not be clear until workers can open up the reactors and examine the fuel, which could be months. \n \n Photo \n \n A meltdown occurs when there is insufficient cooling of the reactor core, and it is the most dangerous kind of a nuclear power accident because of the risk of radiation releases. The radiation levels reported so far by the Japanese authorities are far above normal but still too small to pose a hazard to human health if the exposure continued for a brief period. The fear was that more core damage would bring bigger releases. \n \n The Japanese Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said that as many as 160 people may have been exposed to radiation around the plant, and Japanese news media said that three workers at the facility were suffering from full-on radiation sickness. \n \n Even before the explosion on Saturday, officials said they had detected radioactive cesium, which is created when uranium fuel is split, an indication that some of the nuclear fuel in the reactor was already damaged. \n \n How much damage the fuel suffered remained uncertain, though safety officials insisted repeatedly through the day that radiation leaks outside the plant remained small and did not pose a major health risk. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n However, they also told the International Atomic Energy Agency that they were making preparations to distribute iodine, which helps protect the thyroid gland from radiation exposure, to people living near Daiichi and Daini. \n \n Worries about the safety of the two plants worsened on Saturday because executives of the company that runs them, Tokyo Electric Power, and government officials gave confusing accounts of the location and causes of the dramatic midday explosion and the damage it caused. \n \n Late Saturday night, officials said that the explosion at Daiichi occurred in a structure housing turbines near its No. 1 reactor at the plant, rather than inside the reactor itself. But photographs of the damage did not make clear that this was the case. \n \n They said that the blast, which may have been caused by a sharp buildup of hydrogen when the reactor\u2019s cooling system failed, destroyed the concrete structure surrounding the reactor but did not collapse the critical steel container inside. This pattern of damage cast doubt on the idea that the explosion was in the turbine building. \n \n Photo \n \n \u201cWe\u2019ve confirmed that the reactor container was not damaged,\u201d Mr. Edano said in a news conference on Saturday night. \u201cThe explosion didn\u2019t occur inside the reactor container. As such there was no large amount of radiation leakage outside. At this point, there has been no major change to the level of radiation leakage outside, so we\u2019d like everyone to respond calmly.\u201d \n \n Japanese nuclear safety officials and international experts said that because of crucial design differences, the release of radiation at Daiichi would most likely be much smaller than at Chernobyl even if the plant had a complete core meltdown, which they said it had not. \n \n After a full day of worries about the radiation leaking at Daiichi, Tokyo Electric Power said an explosion occurred \u201cnear\u201d the No. 1 reactor at Daiichi around 3:40 p.m. Japan time on Saturday. It said four of its workers were injured in the blast. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

Based on the reports he was seeing, he said he believed that the explosion was caused by a hydrogen formation, which could have begun inside the reactor core. \u201cNow, every hour they gain in keeping the reactor cooling down is crucial,\u201d he said. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n But he was also concerned about the presence of spent nuclear fuel in a pool inside the same reactor building. The pool, too, needs to remain full of water to suppress gamma radiation and prevent the old fuel from melting. If the spent fuel is also exposed \u2014 and so far there are only sketchy reports about the condition of that building \u2014 it could also pose a significant risk to the workers trying to prevent a meltdown. \n \n Both Daiichi and Daini were shut down by Friday\u2019s earthquake, but the loss of power in the area and damage to the plants\u2019 generators from the ensuing tsunami crippled the cooling systems. Those are crucial after a shutdown to cool down the nuclear fuel rods. \n \n The malfunctions allowed pressure to build up beyond the design capacity of the reactors. Early Saturday, officials had said that small amounts of radioactive vapor were expected to be released into the atmosphere to prevent damage to the containment systems and that they were evacuating people in the area as a precaution. \n \n Photo \n \n Those releases apparently did not prevent the buildup of hydrogen inside the plant, which ignited and exploded Saturday afternoon, government officials said. They said the explosion itself did not increase the amount of radioactive material being released into the atmosphere. However, safety officials urged people who were not evacuating but still lived relatively nearby to cover their mouths and stay indoors. \n \n David Lochbaum, who worked at three reactors in the United States with designs similar to Daiichi, and who was later hired by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to teach its personnel about that technology, said that judging by photographs of the stricken plant, the explosion appeared to have occurred in the turbine hall, not the reactor vessel or the containment that surrounds the vessel. \n \n The Daiichi reactor is a boiling-water reactor. Inside the containment, the reactor sends its steam out to a turbine. The turbine converts the steam\u2019s energy into rotary motion, which turns a generator and makes electricity. \n \n But as the water goes through the reactor, some water molecules break up into hydrogen and oxygen. A system in the turbine hall usually scrubs out those gases. Hydrogen is also used in the turbine hall to cool the electric generator. Hydrogen from both sources has sometimes escaped and exploded, Mr. Lochbaum said, but in this case, there is an additional source of hydrogen: interaction of steam with the metal of the fuel rods. Operators may have vented that hydrogen into the turbine hall. \n \n Earlier Saturday, before the explosion, a Japanese nuclear safety panel said the radiation levels were 1,000 times above normal in a reactor control room at Daiichi. Some radioactive material had also seeped outside, with radiation levels near the main gate measured at eight times normal levels, NHK quoted nuclear safety officials as saying. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The emergency at Daiichi began shortly after the earthquake struck Friday afternoon. Emergency diesel generators, which kicked in to run the cooling system after the electrical power grid failed, shut down about an hour after the earthquake. There was speculation that the tsunami had flooded the generators, knocking them out of service. \n \n For some time, the plant was able to operate in a battery-controlled cooling mode. Tokyo Electric Power said that by Saturday morning it had also installed a mobile generator to ensure that the cooling system would continue operating even after reserve battery power was depleted. Even so, the company said it needed to conduct \u201ccontrolled containment venting\u201d in order to avoid an \u201cuncontrolled rupture and damage\u201d to the containment unit. \n \n Why the controlled release of pressure did not succeed in addressing the problem was not immediately explained. Tokyo Electric Power and government nuclear safety officials also did not explain the precise sequence of failures at the plant. \n \n Daiichi and other nuclear facilities are designed with extensive backup systems that are supposed to function in emergencies to ensure the plants can be shut down safely. ||||| VIENNA Radiation leaked from Japan's quake-stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant on Saturday after a blast blew its roof off. Assessments of the danger varied. The critical issue is what happens to the radioactive reactor fuel. \n \n \"We don't know enough about what the status of the fuel is in the reactor core,\" nuclear expert Mark Hibbs of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said. \"The issue is whether the core is uncovered, whether the fuel is breaking up or being damaged, or whether the fuel is melting.\" \n \n WHAT HAPPENED ? \n \n An explosion occurred at the 40-year-old Daichi 1 reactor as plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco) tried to reduce pressure in the core after the total loss of power needed to keep water circulating to prevent it from overheating. \n \n This led to fears of a disastrous meltdown at the plant, which shut down automatically after Friday's quake. \n \n The government later said radiation levels were low because the explosion had not affected the reactor core container, although it had severely damaged the main building. \n \n \"The most probable (cause of the blast) is that the coolant, particularly if it's water, can overheat and turn to steam more rapidly than it was designed to,\" said nuclear fuel technology professor Timothy Abram at Manchester University. \n \n The cause and exact location of the blast still needs to be established, said nuclear physics professor Paddy Regan at Surrey University. \"So far it looks like it's not the reactor core that's affected, which would be good news.\" \n \n The World Nuclear Association, a London-based industry body, said the blast was probably due to hydrogen igniting and that this was unlikely to cause a big accident by itself. \n \n \"It is obviously an hydrogen explosion,\" communications director Ian Hore-Lacy said. \"If the hydrogen has ignited, then it is gone, it doesn't pose any further threat.\" \n \n HOW SERIOUS COULD IT BE? \n \n Views differ. Stratfor, a risk consultancy, initially said there appeared to be a reactor meltdown, but others disagreed, dismissing any comparisons with the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine. \n \n In an updated analysis, Stratfor said new developments \"may suggest positive signs for authorities' efforts to contain the problem.\" But \"many dangers and risks remain,\" it added. \n \n Abram, the Manchester professor, said it was unlikely it would develop into anything more serious, though this would depend on the integrity of the fuel. He believed it \"pretty unlikely\" that the fuel had been significantly damaged. \n \n \"If the fuel is substantially intact, then there'll be a much, much lower release of radioactivity and the explosion that's happened might be just due to a build-up of steam in the reactor circuit,\" he said. \n \n Apparently backing this view, the government said the plant's concrete building collapsed in the blast, but the reactor container inside did not explode. \n \n The top government spokesman said Tepco, the operator, planned to fill the leaking reactor with sea water to cool it down and reduce pressure. \n \n Carnegie's Hibbs said: \"If they are suggesting that the reactor vessel is intact and that they have a way to get cold water into the core of the reactor to cool that core down, that is very good news indeed.\" \n \n It is too early to say that a \"catastrophe has been averted,\" Stratfor said. \n \n A nuclear technology expert who declined to be named said the situation was still \"very serious\" as the cause of the explosion had yet to be determined. He blamed the accident on rising pressure inside the reactor. \n \n (Editing by Tim Pearce)",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 If it's been tough to gauge how much risk is posed by Japan's damaged nuclear plants, it's because officials have given what the New York Times describes as \"confusing accounts\" of exactly what's going on. Safety officials say the explosion at the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant destroyed walls of the building where the reactor is located, but not the metal housing enclosing the reactor, notes AP. The blast released radioactive material, but officials say the amounts are so small the public isn't endangered. Nevertheless, they widened the evacuation zone, warned people to stay inside, and prepared to distribute iodine tablets. Reuters rounds up assessments of experts, but the bottom line seems to be that more information is needed. \"We don't know enough about what the status of the fuel is in the reactor core,\" says one. \"The issue is whether the core is uncovered, whether the fuel is breaking up or being damaged, or whether the fuel is melting.\" The Washington Post talks to one doctor who arrived from Germany to provide relief, but is curtailing plans to go too far north. \"I'd rather be working with a pocket knife in Haiti than worrying about the danger of a radioactive cloud.\"",

    "document": "This morning I woke up with a hangover softly pulsing in my left temple. \n \n I took a quick inventory: Last night I went from happy-hour drinks with a former colleague (two glasses of ros\u00e9\u2014 or was it three?), then to dinner with a friend (another glass of ros\u00e9), then to a nightcap with another friend (a beer). \n \n I don\u2019t make a habit of bar-crawling on weekday nights the way I did when I was in my 20s and working in D.C. Now I live in Los Angeles, where I\u2019m a freelancer whose meetings mostly take place over coffee and whose friends are more likely to suggest we go for a hike than a cocktail. And so when I do end up having more than a single glass of wine with dinner, I don\u2019t beat myself up about it. \n \n But this morning was different. When I felt the twinge of a hangover, I immediately thought of an essay that I \u2014 and, judging by Facebook and Twitter, almost every woman I know \u2014 read recently. In it, writer Kristi Coulter makes a deft and passionate argument that modern women drink to excess to escape the realities of living in a still-too-sexist world. \u201cI see that booze is the oil in our motors, the thing that keeps us purring when we should be making other kinds of noise,\u201d writes Coulter, who is now sober. \n \n Coulter describes blowing off steam after serving on a sexist panel at work by drinking Manhattans and eating some expensive tapas with her female friends. She calls out women she knows for inserting alcohol into every social scenario, from a morning walk through the farmers market to a trip to the waxing salon. \u201cMaybe all that wine is an Instagram filter for our own lives, so we don\u2019t see how sallow and cracked they\u2019ve become,\u201d she writes. \n \n Her essay is getting a lot of attention because it\u2019s incredibly well-written and because it does what all compelling trend stories do: It helps us notice something that is ubiquitous in our lives and draws some firm conclusions about the deeper significance. Naturally, Coulter\u2019s firm conclusion \u2014 that women drink to cope with the pressures of living in a sexist society \u2014 has attracted some critics. In Slate, Nora Caplan-Bricker counters that \u201cmany men also spend their free time floating away from their problems on a river of booze. They don\u2019t strike me as participants in an unrelated phenomenon.\u201d We are all depleted by the demands of our lives, she writes. In other words, blame capitalism, perhaps, but not the patriarchy. \n \n I don\u2019t think Coulter is entirely wrong. But it\u2019s also impossible to prove that she\u2019s right. Like most women who call themselves feminists, I know that living in a sexist world shapes my life and choices. It\u2019s probably why I feel \u201ccleaner\u201d with shaved legs and like to wear bright lipstick. In one specific instance, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s why I was denied a promotion. In most cases, though, when it comes to decisions I make, it\u2019s difficult to separate what is and isn\u2019t related to the patriarchy. Do I feel more powerful with short hair because of the patriarchy? Do I pick my cuticles when I get nervous because of the patriarchy? Do I have a distant relationship with my mom because of the patriarchy? Did I get drunk last night because of the patriarchy? Who knows. \n \n Women are also shaped by the culture we consume, which muddies the waters even more. Think Olivia Pope, the \u201cScandal\u201d protagonist who self-medicates with red wine. (And always while wearing a white sweater, sitting on a white couch, never spilling a drop. It\u2019s a perfect visual metaphor for Olivia\u2019s need to be perfect in order to counter the twin demons of sexism and racism.) And Coulter mentions the women of \u201cSex and the City,\u201d whose \u201cf\u2014 it, let\u2019s get cosmos\u201d attitude is ancient pop culture history by this point. Women have a lot of models for booze as both a coping mechanism and a bonding tool. Are these shows merely reflecting real women\u2019s propensity to drink to cope with patriarchy? Or, in drinking so much, are real women reflecting what we\u2019ve seen so often in movies and on TV? I don\u2019t know. \n \n What I do know is that I don\u2019t share Coulter\u2019s experience of having my female friends insist that all social interactions be lubricated with alcohol \u2014 again, I live in Los Angeles, where there are always at least a few drivers in the group who aren\u2019t drinking. But she did make me sit up and take note of the way wine is coded as part of bonding among women of my socioeconomic status. On the podcast I co-host with my friend Aminatou Sow, we are often drinking wine as we record. Some episodes even feature the \u201cglug, glug\u201d noise of us refilling our glasses. In our online store, we sell a portable wine tumbler branded with our podcast logo. We also discuss the patriarchy a lot. I\u2019d never considered that the two things might be related. \n \n Even if they are, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s such a terrible thing. Perhaps it\u2019s because I\u2019ve never had a drug or alcohol problem, but for me, drinking with other women isn\u2019t just coping or complacency. It\u2019s often about plotting. Sometimes, a few glasses of wine with friends is what helps me connect my outrage with a plan of action. Under the influence of alcohol, I\u2019ve decided to dump a dude who wasn\u2019t treating me right, committed to revamping my career and, honestly, had a lot of fun. Perhaps some women who drink together are victims of groupthink and ignoring their problems. But I associate it with forming deep bonds. And maybe alcohol keeps some women silent. For others \u2014 myself included \u2014 it can embolden us to say what we were too afraid to say when we were sober. Drinking together does not always mean screeching and splashing in the shallow end of the hotel pool. \n \n Maybe patriarchy does drive us to drink, just as patriarchy drives us to shave our legs and wear bright lipstick. Or maybe it doesn\u2019t, and we get drunk for the same reasons that men do. Either way, I\u2019m less concerned about what draws women together over a bottle of wine, and more interested in what we do once we get there. Coulter writes, \u201cWork is hard and there\u2019s still no good way to be a girl and I don\u2019t know what to do with my life and I have to actually deal with all of that.\u201d \n \n I have a good idea about where to start. Let\u2019s plot a revolution together. I\u2019ll bring the wine \u2014 but don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t need to drink if that\u2019s not your thing. \n \n Correction: This piece initially stated that writer Kristi Coulter described drinking half a dozen Manhattans with her friends. In fact, Coulter merely described drinking an unspecified number of \u201crye Manhattans.\u201d ||||| I\u2019m newly sober and dog-paddling through the booze all around me.

At the office, every desk near mine has a bottle of wine or liquor on it in case people are too lazy to walk the 50 feet to one of the well-stocked communal bars we\u2019ve built on our floor. Driving home from work, I pass billboard ads for Fluffed Marshmallow Smirnoff and Iced Cake Smirnoff and not just Cinnamon, but Cinnamon Churros Smirnoff. A local pharmacy, the same one that fucks up my prescription three months in a row, installs self-service beer taps and young men line up with their empty growlers all the way back to Eye & Ear Care. \n \n Traveling for work, I steel myself for the company-sponsored wine tasting. Skipping it is not an option. My plan is to work the room with my soda and lime, make sure I\u2019m seen by the five people who care about these things, and leave before things get sloppy (which they always do). Six wines and four beers are on display at the catering stand. I ask for club soda and get a blank look. Just water, then? The bartender grimaces apologetically. \u201cI think there\u2019s a water fountain in the lobby?\u201d she says. \n \n There is. But it\u2019s broken. I mingle empty-handed for 15 minutes, fending off well-meaning offers to get me something from the bar. After the fifth, I realize I\u2019m going to cry if one more person offers me alcohol. I leave and cry anyway. Later I order vanilla ice cream from room service to cheer myself up. \n \n \u201cPeople love this with a shot of bourbon poured over it,\u201d the person taking my order says. \u201cAny interest in treating yourself?\u201d \n \n *** \n \n That\u2019s the summer I realize that everyone around me is tanked. But it also dawns on me that the women are super double tanked \u2014 that to be a modern, urbane woman means to be a serious drinker. This isn\u2019t a new idea \u2014 just ask the Sex and the City girls (or the flappers). A woman with a single malt scotch is bold and discerning and might fire you from her life if you fuck with her. A woman with a PBR is a Cool Girl who will not be shamed for belching. A woman drinking MommyJuice wine is saying she\u2019s more than the unpaid labor she gave birth to. The things women drink are signifiers for free time and self-care and conversation \u2014 you know, luxuries we can\u2019t afford. How did you not see this before? I ask myself. You were too hammered, I answer back. That summer I see, though. I see that booze is the oil in our motors, the thing that keeps us purring when we should be making other kinds of noise. \n \n *** \n \n One day that summer I\u2019m wearing unwise (but cute, so cute) shoes and trip at the farmer\u2019s market, cracking my phone, blood-staining the knees of my favorite jeans, and scraping both my palms. Naturally, I post about it on Facebook as soon as I\u2019ve dusted myself off. Three women who don\u2019t know I\u2019m sober comment quickly: \n \n \u201cWine. Immediately.\u201d \n \n \u201cDo they sell wine there?\u201d \n \n \u201cDefinitely wine. And maybe new shoes.\u201d \n \n Have I mentioned that it\u2019s morning when this happens? On a weekday? This isn\u2019t one of those nightclub farmer\u2019s markets. And the women aren\u2019t the kind of beleaguered, downtrodden creatures you imagine drinking to get through the day. They\u2019re pretty cool chicks, the kind people ridicule for having First World Problems. Why do they need to drink? \n \n Well, maybe because even cool chicks are still women. And there\u2019s no easy way to be a woman, because, as you may have noticed, there\u2019s no acceptable way to be a woman. And if there\u2019s no acceptable way to be the thing you are, then maybe you drink a little. Or a lot. \n \n *** \n \n The year before I get sober, I\u2019m asked to be The Woman on a panel at the company where I work. (That was literally the pitch: \u201cWe need one woman.\u201d) Three guys and me, talking to summer interns about company culture. There are two female interns in the audience, and when it\u2019s time for questions, one says: \n \n \u201cI\u2019ve heard this can be a tough place for women to succeed. Can you talk about what it\u2019s been like for you?\u201d \n \n As The Woman, I assume for some reason that the question is directed at me. \u201cIf you\u2019re tough and persistent and thick-skinned, you\u2019ll find your way,\u201d I say. \u201cI have.\u201d \n \n I don\u2019t say she\u2019ll have to work around interruptions and invisibility and micro-aggressions and a scarcity of role models and a lifetime of her own conditioning. My job on this panel is to make this place sound good, so I leave some stuff out. Particularly the fact that I\u2019m drinking at least one bottle of wine a night to dissolve the day off of me. \n \n But she\u2019s a woman. She probably learned to read between the lines before she could read the lines themselves. She thanks me and sits down. \n \n \u201cI disagree,\u201d says the guy sitting next to me. \u201cI think this is a great company for women.\u201d \n \n My jaw gently opens on its own. \n \n The guy next to him nods. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cI have two women on my team and they get along great with everyone.\u201d \n \n Of course they do, I think but don\u2019t say. It\u2019s called camouflage. \n \n Guy #1 continues. \u201cThere\u2019s a woman on my team who had a baby last year. She went on maternity leave and came back, and she\u2019s doing fine. We\u2019re very supportive of moms.\u201d \n \n Guy #3 jumps in just to make sure we have 100% male coverage on the topic. \u201cThe thing about this place,\u201d he says, \u201cis it\u2019s a meritocracy. And merit is gender-blind.\u201d He smiles at me and I stare back. Silent balefulness is all I have to offer, but his smile wavers so I know I\u2019ve pierced some level of smug. \n \n The panel organizer and I fume afterward. \u201cThose fucking fucks,\u201d she says. \u201cRatfucks.\u201d \n \n What\u2019s a girl to do when a bunch of dudes have just told her, in front of an audience, that she\u2019s wrong about what it\u2019s like to be herself? \n \n What\u2019s a girl to do when a bunch of dudes have just told her, in front of an audience, that she\u2019s wrong about what it\u2019s like to be herself? I could talk to them, one by one, and tell them how it felt. I could tell the panel organizers this is why you never have just one of us up there. I could buy myself a superhero costume and devote the rest of my life to vengeance on mansplainers everywhere. \n \n Instead, I round up some girlfriends and we spend hundreds of dollars in a hipster bar, drinking rye Manhattans and eating tapas and talking about the latest crappy, non-gender-blind things that have happened to us in meetings and on business trips and at performance review time. They toast me for taking one for the team. And when we are good and numb we Uber home, thinking Look at all we\u2019ve earned! That bar with the twinkly lights. That miniature food. This chauffeured black car. We are tough enough to put up with being ignored and interrupted and underestimated every day and laugh it off together. We\u2019ve made it. This is the good life. Nothing needs to change. \n \n *** \n \n Do you remember the Enjoli perfume commercial from the 1970s? The chick who could bring home the bacon, fry it up in a pan, and never let you forget you\u2019re a man? \n \n I blame that bitch for a lot. For spreading the notion that women should have a career, keep house, and fuck their husbands, when the only sane thing to do is pick two and outsource the third. For making it seem glamorous. For suggesting it was going to be fun. And for the tagline she dragged around: \u201cThe 8-Hour Perfume for the 24-Hour Woman.\u201d Just in case you thought you could get one fucking hour off the clock. \n \n More tales of my first sober summer: I go to an afternoon showing of Magic Mike at one of those fancy theaters that serves cocktails to blunt the terrible stress of watching a movie in air-conditioned comfort. A few rows ahead of me, a group of women are drinking champagne through straws. They whoop and holler at the screen as though at an actual Chippendale\u2019s. In the parking lot afterward, one of them says to the others: \u201cGirl time! We have to claim our girl time.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve earned this,\u201d another replies. And then they drive off in separate directions. \n \n There\u2019s always one person who can\u2019t deal if someone isn\u2019t drinking. \n \n A baby shower is in progress at the nail parlor. Except for the guest of honor, everyone is drinking wine, lots of it. I wonder if the mom-to-be minds, if it feels like they\u2019re rubbing it in. \u201cThank God there are places like this where we can have lady time,\u201d a woman in a yellow dress says. She tells the mom-to-be she\u2019s far enough along to have some wine. It seems important to her that the mom-to-be drink with them. I catch myself nodding. You, I think. Yeah, I know you. There\u2019s always one person who can\u2019t deal if someone isn\u2019t drinking. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m going to feel hungover by dinner,\u201d a different woman says. \u201cBut it\u2019s so worth it. How often do you get a chance to get away from your kids for an afternoon?\u201d \n \n I personally think this is an insensitive thing to say at a baby shower. \n \n Is it really that hard, being a First World woman? Is it really so tough to have the career and the spouse and the pets and the herb garden and the core strengthening and the oh-I-just-woke-up-like-this makeup and the face injections and the Uber driver who might possibly be a rapist? Is it so hard to work ten hours for your rightful 77% of a salary, walk home past a drunk who invites you to suck his cock, and turn on the TV to hear the men who run this country talk about protecting you from abortion regret by forcing you to grow children inside your body? \n \n I mean, what\u2019s the big deal? Why would anyone want to soften the edges of this glorious reality? \n \n *** \n \n I run a women\u2019s half-marathon on a day in August when temperatures are fifteen degrees above normal. It\u2019s a \u2014 what do you call it \u2014 a horror show. But I finish and someone puts a finisher\u2019s medal on me. I\u2019m soaked, chafed, limping, and still triumphant. Until they say: \u201cThe margarita tent is right over there!\u201d \n \n A yoga studio where I sometimes practice starts a monthly \u201cVinyasa & Vino\u201d event: an hour of fast-paced yoga in a hundred-degree room, followed by a glass of an addictive, dehydrating substance (made locally!). Oh, but it\u2019s about mindful savoring, I\u2019m told. Well, then. Apologies for thinking it was about mindful reciprocal advertising to an overwhelmingly female audience, and om shanti. \n \n A local kitchen shop offers a combination knife-skills and wine-tasting class \u2014 yes, wine for people who have already self-identified as being so clumsy with sharp objects that they need professional instruction. \n \n At the waxing salon, a cut-glass decanter of tequila is at the ready for first-time Brazilian customers, which \u2014 okay, you know what, that tequila was actually pretty helpful back in the day, and far be it from me to deprive other first-timers. \n \n Is there nothing so inherently absorbing or high-stakes or pleasurable that we won\u2019t try to alter our natural response to it? \n \n But knives and booze, yoga and booze, 13 mile runs and booze? What\u2019s next to be liquored up: CPR training? Puppy ballet class? (Not really a thing, but someone should get on it.) Is there nothing so inherently absorbing or high-stakes or pleasurable that we won\u2019t try to alter our natural response to it? Maybe women are so busy faking it \u2014 to be more like a man at work, more like a porn star in bed, more like 30 at 50 \u2014 that we don\u2019t trust our natural responses anymore. Maybe all that wine is an Instagram filter for our own lives, so we don\u2019t see how sallow and cracked they\u2019ve become. \n \n Toward the end of summer I take a trip to Sedona and post a photo to Facebook that captures the red rocks, a stack of books, a giant cocoa smoothie, and my glossy azure toenails in one frame. It is scientifically the most vacation-y photo ever taken. \n \n \u201cUh, where\u2019s the wine?\u201d someone wants to know. \n \n \u201cYeah, this vacation seems to be missing wine,\u201d someone else chimes in. \n \n I go to a stationery store to buy a card for a girlfriend. I couldn\u2019t keep it together enough to track greeting card occasions when I was drinking, so it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve visited a card shop. There are three themes in female-to-female cards: 1) being old as fuck, 2) men are from Mars, and 3) wine. \n \n \u201cWine is to women as duct tape is to men\u2026it fixes everything!\u201d \n \n \u201cI make wine disappear. What\u2019s your superpower?\u201d \n \n \u201cLord, give me coffee to change the things I can\u2026and wine to accept the things I cannot.\u201d \n \n Newly sober women have a lot of wonderful qualities, but lack of judginess not one of them. I don\u2019t just stand there mentally tsk-tsking at the cards. I actually physically shake my head at them like Mrs. Grundy. Are you sure you can\u2019t change those things? I think. And have you stopped to think that if you need ethanol \u2014 yes, at this point in my sobriety I called wine ethanol, don\u2019t you wish you could have hung out with me then? \u2014 to accept them, maybe it\u2019s because they\u2019re unacceptable? \n \n *** \n \n The longer I am sober, the less patience I have with being a 24-hour woman. The stranger who tells me to smile. The janitor who stares at my legs. The men on TV who want to annex my uterus. Even the other TV men, who say that abortion should be \u201csafe, legal, and rare.\u201d What the fuck business is it of yours whether it\u2019s rare or not? I think. \n \n The magazines telling me strong is the new sexy and smart is the new beautiful, as though strong and smart are just paths to hot. The Facebook memes: muscles are beautiful. No, wait: fat is beautiful. No, wait: thin is beautiful, too, as long as you don\u2019t work for it. No, wait: All women are beautiful! As though we are toddlers who must be given exactly equal shares of princess dust, or we\u2019ll lose our shit. \n \n And then I start to get angry at women, too. Not for being born wrong, or for failing to dismantle a thousand years of patriarchy on my personal timetable. But for being so easily mollified by a bottle. For thinking that the right to get as trashed as a man means anything but the right to be as useless. \n \n \u201cWhat,\u201d says a woman I enjoy arguing with, \u201cso they can get fucked up and we have to look after them?\u201d \n \n No, I tell her. We have to look after ourselves. \n \n \u201cThat still doesn\u2019t seem fair,\u201d she says, not unreasonably. \n \n We can\u2019t afford to live lives we have to fool our own central nervous systems into tolerating. \n \n But who said anything about fairness? This isn\u2019t about what\u2019s fair. It\u2019s about what we can afford. And we can\u2019t afford this. We can\u2019t afford to pretend it\u2019s fine that everything we do or think or wear or say yes or no to is somehow wrong. We can\u2019t afford to act like it\u2019s okay that \u201cGirls can do anything!\u201d got translated somewhere along the line into \u201cWomen must do everything.\u201d We can\u2019t afford to live lives we have to fool our own central nervous systems into tolerating. \n \n We can\u2019t afford to be 24-hour women. \n \n I couldn\u2019t afford to be a 24-hour woman. But it didn\u2019t stop me from trying till it shattered me. \n \n I am very angry with women that summer and then I\u2019m very, very angry with myself. And I stay that way for months, trudging through my first sober Christmas and job change and flu and birthday and using that anger at every turn as a reminder to pay attention and go slow and choose things I actually want to happen. By the time summer comes back around I realize I no longer smell like eight-hour perfume. \n \n *** \n \n That second summer, I meet my friend Mindy outside San Diego, where her adopted son is days from being born. Mindy\u2019s dark alleys were different from mine, but she walked them all the same and walked herself out of them, too. Sometimes, talking about the recent past, we blink at each other like people struggling to readjust to sunlight after a long, bad movie. More and more it\u2019s the new that gets our attention: my new job, her newish and happy marriage, the book I\u2019m writing and the classes she\u2019s taking. The things we are making happen, step by step. \n \n We spend the weekend moving slowly and sleeping late and \u2014 hypocritically \u2014 wishing the lazy baby would hurry up already. On Sunday morning we\u2019re reading by the deep end of the hotel pool when the shallow end starts to fill with women, a bridal party to judge by what we overhear. And we overhear a lot, because they arrive already tipsy and the pomegranate mimosas \u2014 pomegranate is a superfood! one woman keeps telling the others \u2014 just keep coming until that side of the pool seems like a Greek chorus of women who have major grievances with their bodies, faces, children, homes, jobs, and husbands but aren\u2019t going to do anything about any of it but get loaded and sunburned in the desert heat. \n \n I give Mindy the look that women use to say do you believe this shit? with only a slight tightening of the eyeballs. The woman on the other side of her catches the look and gives it back to me over her laptop, and then woman next to her joins in too. We engage in a silent four-way exchange of dismay, irritation, and bitchiness, and it is wonderful. \n \n Then Mindy slides her Tom Ford sunglasses back over her eyes and says, \u201cAll I can say is it\u2019s really nice on this side of the pool.\u201d I laugh and my heart swells against my swimsuit and I pull my shades down too, to keep my suddenly watery eyes to myself. Because it is. It is so nice on this side of the pool, where the book I\u2019m reading is a letdown and my legs look too white and the ice has long since melted in my glass and work is hard and there\u2019s still no good way to be a girl and I don\u2019t know what to do with my life and I have to actually deal with all of that. I never expected to make it to this side of the pool. I can\u2019t believe I get to be here. \n \n This article is part of Quartz Ideas, our home for bold arguments and big thinkers.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A recent essay on Quartz by Kristi Coulter has been making waves on social media, with a (now-sober) Coulter saying she thinks 21st-century women guzzle too much hooch to forget about the sexist world we live in. Ann Friedman offers her own take, writing for the Washington Post that even though she takes some of Coulter's \"well-written\" points to heart, she's not completely on board with Coulter's conclusion, noting it's \"difficult to separate what is and isn't related to the patriarchy.\" \"Did I get drunk last night because of the patriarchy? Who knows,\" she says, listing other woman-related issues (e.g., a penchant for short hair, picking at one's cuticles) that could theoretically be linked to a male-dominated society. Friedman lays out why she's reluctant to fully toast Coulter's thesis, noting many men also drink to deal with the day-to-day, and that pop culture\u2014especially via boozy women protagonists on TV and in the movies\u2014has much to do with it, too, presenting alcohol \"as both a coping mechanism and a bonding tool.\" And she cites her own personal imbibing, relaying how her boozing sessions tend to serve a more active \"plotting\" purpose to direct her \"outrage,\" with her drinking buddies serving as sounding boards. \"Maybe patriarchy does drive us to drink, just as patriarchy drives us to shave our legs and wear bright lipstick,\" she concludes. \"Or maybe it doesn\u2019t, and we get drunk for the same reasons that men do. Either way, I'm less concerned about what draws women together over a bottle of wine, and more interested in what we do once we get there.\" (Her entire essay here.)",

    "document": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some 200,000 Salvadoran immigrants allowed to live and work in the United States since 2001 will lose their right to remain in the country in 2019, officials said on Monday, marking the Trump administration\u2019s latest move to tighten immigration enforcement. \n \n The United States will end the Salvadorans\u2019 temporary protected status (TPS) on Sept. 9, 2019, giving them 18 months to leave or seek lawful residency, and for El Salvador to prepare for their return, administration officials said. The status was granted in the wake of two devastating 2001 earthquakes in El Salvador that left hundreds of thousands in the country homeless. \n \n The decision to end TPS for Salvadorans is part of the administration\u2019s broader push to tighten immigration laws and expel those living in the United States illegally. The move was heavily criticized by immigrant advocates who said it ignored violence in El Salvador and gave the Salvadorans few options but to leave the United States or remain illegally. \n \n The Trump administration has faced a series of deadlines over the past year to decide whether to end the protected status of immigrants in the United States whose home countries have been affected by disasters. \n \n Salvadorans are by far the largest group under TPS, a program administration officials said is supposed to provide a temporary haven for victims, not a permanent right to remain in the United States. \n \n Critics have complained TPS has allowed participants to repeatedly extend their stays in 6-month to 18-month increments. \n \n Patricia Hernandez, 53, arrived in the United States in 2000 and applied for TPS after the 2001 earthquakes. She has lived in North Carolina for 18 years and runs a subcontracting construction business with her Honduran husband. The couple have two U.S.-born teenage sons. \n \n \u201cThis is a real blow for everyone,\u201d said Hernandez by telephone. \u201cMost of us pay taxes, we\u2019re not living off the government, we\u2019re not criminals.\u201d \n \n The family will move to Honduras with their children and the couple do not intend to return north, she said, though they worry about violence and political instability in central America. \n \n Trump administration changes to the TPS program mean that over the next two years approximately 250,000 people who previously had permission to live and work in the United States will be subject to deportation if they remain. \n \n Haitians and Nicaraguans will lose their protected status in 2019 and Hondurans, the second largest group in the program, could lose their rights later this year. \n \n Maria Gloria Ceren de Quinonez poses with a picture of her daughter Susana and granddaughters Gabriela and Monica who live in the U.S. under the Temporary Protected Status, in Santa Tecla, El Salvador January 8, 2018. REUTERS/Jose Cabezas \n \n \u201cThe past practice of allowing foreign nationals to remain in the United States long after an initial emergency in their home countries has ended has undermined the integrity of the program and essentially made the \u2018temporary\u2019 protected status a front operation for backdoor permanent immigration,\u201d said Roy Beck, president of NumbersUSA, which favors less immigration overall. \n \n VIOLENCE IN EL SALVADOR \n \n Advocates of the program say long-term resident Salvadorans and their children should not be sent back to El Salvador, a country struggling with a weak economy and gang violence that has given it one of the world\u2019s highest murder rates. \n \n \u201cOur (U.S) government is complicit in breaking up families \u2014 nearly 275,000 U.S.-born children have a parent who is a TPS holder \u2014 and further destabilizing our neighboring countries,\u201d said Oscar Chacon, executive director of Alianza Americas, an immigrant advocacy group. \n \n There are approximately 1.35 million Salvadorans of any status living in the United States, according to U.S. Census Bureau data analyzed by the Migration Policy Institute, a non-partisan think tank. \n \n A senior administration official briefing reporters on the decision said it was based on the status of El Salvador\u2019s recovery from the 2001 earthquakes. The country has received millions of dollars in aid and rebuilt schools, homes and hospitals, the official said. \n \n In the past two years, the United States has repatriated 39,000 Salvadorans, showing the ability of El Salvador to absorb an influx, the official said. \n \n The government of El Salvador said on Monday that it was glad the administration decided to at least leave the program in place until September 2019. \n \n \u201cEl Salvador\u2019s Foreign Ministry lobbied heavily for the interests of our fellow citizens,\u201d the government said in a statement, adding that it would continue to search for alternatives and seek action by the U.S. Congress to protect the migrants. \n \n The U.S. Chamber of Commerce had urged the government to extend TPS protections for Salvadorans, Haitians and Hondurans, saying \u201cthe loss of employment authorization for these populations would adversely impact several key industries,\u201d including \u201cconstruction, food processing, hospitality, and home healthcare services.\u201d \n \n Congressional Democrats on Monday expressed support for finding a permanent solution to help Salvadorans in the United States. But that will be politically difficult at a time when there are rival immigration priorities, including providing permanent protection for \u201cDreamers\u201d - undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children. \n \n That effort has been weighed down by demands from conservatives in Congress to couple any such move with new efforts to clamp down on illegal immigration, especially from Mexico and Central America. \n \n Slideshow (10 Images) ||||| Trump officials argue that the U.S. has been deporting migrants to El Salvador for years, and that temporary protected status was always supposed to be temporary. Last year, the administration ended the program for two other countries, Haiti and Nicaragua. Recipients from those nations, like those from El Salvador, will have an 18-month grace period to leave the U.S. or apply for other forms of immigration relief, officials said.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 An estimated 200,000 Salvadorans and their 190,000 US-born children aren't the only people stressed out about the administration's decision to withdraw Temporary Protected Status: The government of El Salvador, which estimates 95% of TPS holders are employed or own businesses in the US, says it will \"face a great challenge\" if tens of thousands are deported after Sept.19, 2019, when the protection from deportation introduced after two deadly earthquakes in 2001 expires. But Salvadoran officials don't think it will come to that. Foreign Minister Hugo Martinez tells the Washington Post that the government will lobby Congress to find a way for people losing TPS status to remain legal US residents. \"We think we have sufficient time and will work hard for this alternative,\" he says. Congressional Democrats support finding a way for the Salvadorans to stay, though they have multiple other immigration issues to deal with, Reuters reports. Advocates warn that El Salvador has one of the world's highest murder rates, making it a dangerous place to deport people to\u2014and that its economy will be devastated if it loses billions of dollars in remittances from the US. \"This is really bad news for our country,\" Nayib Bukele, the mayor of San Salvador, tells the Los Angeles Times. \"Our country doesn't create opportunities for the Salvadorans who live here. Imagine what we're going to do with 200,000 more coming in.\" Experts say that if there are mass deportations, many former TPS holders are likely to try to move to the US illegally\u2014as will some Salvadorans displaced by the skilled and bilingual new arrivals.",

(He\u2019s still trying to learn the story behind the bloodstain.) \n \n On Friday, Mr. Underwood and his friend Jon Bier became the latest owners of Cerro Gordo, which translates to \u201cfat hill,\u201d after buying it for $1.4 million. They plan to restore the town while preserving its past, Mr. Underwood said, adding that they hope to attract a variety of visitors. He said they expected to spend about $1 million to get things started. \n \n Jake Rasmuson of Bishop Real Estate said that he received hundreds of inquiries after the sale was announced in early June. Twelve of the offers were serious, he said, noting that the original asking price was $925,000. ||||| (CNN) \u2014 It is possible to buy entire towns these days. \n \n A little over a month after a 19th century ghost town in California called Cerro Gordo went on sale, Brent Underwood bought it for $1.4 million, real estate agent Jake Rasmuson said. The asking price for Cerro Gordo is $925,000, according to a property listing \n \n The sale closed on Friday the 13th -- \"in true ghost town fashion,\" Rasmuson quipped. \n \n \"We really didn't expect the activity we had,\" he said, saying that he underestimated the amount of offers the town would receive. \n \n \"We received about a dozen offers, Mr. Underwood's offer was appreciated by the sellers,\" Rasmuson said. \"There were other offers, but Mr. Underwood's plan was beneficial to the preservation and public use of the property.\" \n \n Cerro Gordo has been protected from digger, looters and effects from nature, according to the real estate company. Nolan Nitschke \n \n Cerro Gordo, which means \"fat hill,\" has 22 structures remaining, including an abandoned hotel, church and bunkhouse. The abandoned mining town, which occupies over 300 acres of land, had been in family hands for decades, but they felt it was the right time to sell it, Rasmuson said. \n \n Cerro Gordo came into existence as a small mining town after the discovery of silver in 1865. At one point, it became the largest producer of silver and lead in California, according to its website \n \n \"In its heyday, it averaged a murder a week,\" Rasmuson said. \"It's really part of the Wild West.\" \n \n After the fall of lead and silver prices, and other setbacks, including a fire, Cerro Gordo's silver operations slowed and eventually became deserted. \n \n Buildings on Cerro Gordo include a historic hotel, a bunkhouse and superintendents house. Nolan Nitschke \n \n So what will become of this ghost town? Ideas ranged from turning Cerro Gordo into a theme park to a marijuana town. \n \n But Underwood, who owns a backpacker hostel in Austin, Texas, called HK Austin , says history is the reason he was interested in the town. \n \n \"It isn't often you're entrusted to maintain such an interesting part of American history,\" he said in an email to CNN. \"The town is so rich in history and has impacted so many lives.\" \n \n Underwood said he and business partner Jon Bier had been looking at hospitality locations around the United States that were large enough to create a unique destination. He said a friend sent him the CNN article discussing the initial sale. \n \n \"I knew it was the one,\" Underwood said. \n \n The asking price for Cerro Gordo is $925,000. It was sold for $1.4 million. Nolan Nitschke \n \n Now that he's bought Cerro Gordo, he says he plans to \"renovate a select number of the existing buildings to a point we'd be comfortable hosting people for long periods of time.\" \n \n That includes bringing WiFi to the 19th century property as well, he said. \n \n \"We're looking to create a new destination. It isn't often you're able to have such a canvas to work with. We have over 300 acres and dozens of buildings,\" Underwood said. \"We want to maintain the historic nature of the property while introducing amenities that will allow more people to enjoy the location.\" \n \n The long-term goals for Cerro Gordo are to bring \"high level programming in forms of writing retreats, music events, dining experiences, photo shoots, theater, special events, and more.\" \n \n Underwood said he wants to create an experience that's available nowhere else. ||||| Hard Luck Castle Mine Photo 2 Photo 4 Photo 5 Photo 6 Photo 7 Photo 8 Photo 9 Photo 10 Photo 11 Photo 12 Photo 13 Photo 14 Photo 15 Photo 16 Photo 17 Photo 18 Photo 19 Photo 20 Photo 21 Photo 22 Photo 23 Photo 24 Photo 25 Photo 26 Photo 27 Photo 28 Photo 29 Photo 30 Photo 31 Photo 32 Photo 33 Photo 34 Photo 35 Photo 36 Photo 37 Photo 41 Photo 42 IMG_4752 IMG_4753 IMG_4759 IMG_4758 IMG_4763 IMG_4764 IMG_4767 IMG_4773 IMG_4783 IMG_4777 IMG_4789 IMG_4791 IMG_4799 Video Tour 1 Bonnie Clair Road, Goldfield, NV 89013 \n \n \n \n Features: 4 Bedrooms, 3 Baths \n \n 4 story, 22 rooms, 8,000 square feet \n \n Off grid power.

The 24,000-square-feet of buildings and more than 300 acres of patented mining claims once averaged a \"murder a week\" in its hey day, and was once the largest producer of silver and lead in California. \n \n The new owners, Brent Underwood and Jon Bier, have assembled a team of Los Angeles-based investors for the town with hopes \"to continue this piece of American history.\" \n \n The new owners said prior to the finalization of the sale they met with the previous owners of Cerro Gordo and found they had a common vision for what they hoped the town could be. \n \n \"There were offers that were quite higher than our offer,\" Bier said. \"But to the credit of the family that sold it, they went with our offer because we were going to keep the integrity and tell the story of what makes it culturally significant.\" \n \n \"Our goal is to maintain the historical nature of the property and respect the piece of history,\" Underwood said. \n \n But that's not to say some changes won't be taking place. \n \n Cerro Gordo doesn't have running water so in order to make the town an extended-stay destination, that problem is No. 1 on the list. Both Bier and Underwood spoke of necessary refurbishments to be done to buildings so they are structurally sound as well as adding a restaurant and bar one day. \n \n Underwood said there aren't immediate plans to build new structures and that the current plans primarily revolve around refurbishing the 22 original buildings left standing in the ghost town. \n \n The group of investors have dreams of holding group retreats, stargazing, hiking tours and hatch throwing workshops. \n \n However one thing that won't be changing with the new sale is longtime caretaker, Robert Desmarais. \n \n Desmarais has lived in Cerro Gordo for the past 21 years as a caretaker, living alone in the desolate town even after his wife left the town because of the extreme altitude and weather conditions. \n \n He first came to Cerro Gordo in 1997 after seeing an ad in a trade magazine about mining in the town. Ever since his first visit, he has become one of the keepers of the ghost town. \n \n \"I've fallen in love with the history of the town,\" Desmarais said. \"I like the adventure and I love the fact that I am preserving history.\" \n \n Desmarais said he \"doesn't want to ever leave\" the wild wild west town and continues to hope that more people come and experience it. \n \n \"I just really hope that the town can stay historically correct,\" Desmarais added. \"And that more people can come and visit the town.\" ||||| Historic California ghost town sells for $1.4 million on Friday the 13th \n \n The 19th-century mining town of Cedro Gordo and the surrounding 300 acres outside Lone Pine, Calif., is listed for $925,000.

It was listed for for $925,000 in June and closed on Friday the 13th for $1.4 million. \n \n \"I would say the date was very coincidental,\" says listing agent Jake Rasmuson of Bishop Real Estate. \"Strictly by chance but very fitting for the property.\" \n \n The seller accepted an offer from a group of Los Angeles investors who plan to preserve the relic of the American West and keep it open to the public. \n \n \"We did have higher offers, however the sellers really liked the buyers' proposal and liked the buyers' plan,\" says Rasmuson. \n \n Now Playing: \n \n In the shadow of Mount Whitney, the property includes vast acreage of sage-studded land with mineral rights and a well-preserved authentic ghost town. There are almost two dozen buildings, including a church, a saloon, a historic hotel called the Belshaw Bunkhouse, a hoist house and a superintendent's house. \n \n The town was protected from diggers over the years, and many artifacts from the area are housed in a museum. \n \n Cerro Gordo has been in the hands of the same family for decades, and though privately owned, it was open to the public for tours. The owners were hoping to sell to someone who appreciates the property's history. \n \n ALSO, Northern California ranch, nearly the size of San Francisco, listed for $31 million \n \n The buyers are Brent Underwood, who founded the youth hostel HK Austin and Jon Bier, who runs a public relations firm catering to athletes. The two teamed up with other investors to make the purchase; they include Ryan Holiday, former director of marketing at American Apparel; Tero Isokauppila, CEO/founder of superfood company Four Sigmatic; Brendan \n \n Gahan, CEO/founder of Epic Signal; George Rutolo, owner of The Whisky Bars; and Kelley Mooney, an en executive at Hulu. \n \n \"We want to maintain the historic nature of the property while introducing amenities that will allow more people to enjoy this piece of American history,\" Underwood says. \"We have spent a lot of time with the current owners and caretaker to learn the history of the place. I've read all the books I can find on the town. I can't express our excitement to be able to continue the care of this beautiful location.\" \n \n He adds that they also hope to eventually add overnight accommodations and events such as writing retreats, concerts, photo shoots, theater and more. \n \n Silver was first discovered in the hills of Cerro Gordo in 1865, and in the following years prospectors flocked to its rich veins of silver. It became known as the \"silver thread\" to Los Angeles and silver was loaded onto mule trains and taken to the city. The town population swelled to some 5,000 at its height and quickly dwindled when silver prices dropped in 1877. \n \n \"We want to create a place that pays tribute to this historic part of American history,\" Underwood says.",

While it's a strong gross for the war drama's third weekend out, it means the film just barely missed the record for the biggest Super Bowl weekend gross of all time. \n \n That title is held by 2008's Hanna Montana/Miley Cyrus: The Best of Both Worlds Concert Tour, which earned $31.1 million over big game weekend. However, American Sniper did unseat 2010's Dear John ($30.5 million) for the second biggest Super Bowl weekend tally. \n \n Last weekend, the Oscar-nominated Sniper became the biggest war-themed film of all time, eclipsing the $216.5 million earned by Saving Private Ryan, not accounting for inflation. The film's new domestic tally is a stunning $247.98 million. \n \n The Bradley Cooper-starring war drama , easily beat out three new films braving a launch despite the NFL championship game: Project Almanac, Black or White and The Loft. \n \n Theater attendance takes a big hit on Super Bowl Sunday, so it's no surprise that no high-profile titles opened this weekend. Indeed, both Project Almanac and The Loft open after long delays. \n \n It looks like all three newcomers will fall below holdover Paddington. The family film, now in its third week, earned an estimated $8.5 million, and while Project Almanac, a found-footage thriller produced by Michael Bay's Platinum Dunes, is also estimated to have earned $8.5 million, it's likely that Paddington will come out on top for the No. 2 spot when the dust settles and the final numbers come in Monday. \n \n Project Almanac, earning a B CinemaScore, follows a brilliant high school student and his friends as they uncover blueprints for a mysterious device that allows them to time travel. Jonny Weston, Sofia Black-D\u2019Elia, Sam Lerner, Allen Evangelista and Virginia Gardner star. It was originally set to open a year ago, but Bay wanted to tinker with the movie. \n \n Black or White, filmmaker Mike Binder's racially charged drama starring Kevin Costner and Octavia Spencer, took the No. 4 spot with a tally of $6.5 million for its domestic debut. The film, which received an A- CinemaScore, hoped to serve as counterprogramming for adults, opening in 1,823 locations this weekend. An estimated 78 percent of its opening weekend audience was over 25 years old. \n \n Relativity acquired U.S. rights to Black or White after its world premiere at the 2014 Toronto Film Festival and is releasing the film in association with IM Global and Sunlight Productions. \n \n When no studio would make the $9 million film, Costner invested some of his own money in Black or White, which chronicles a bitter custody fight that ensues when a child's African-American grandmother (Spencer) insists that the child be raised by her son, the girl's father, and not by Costner's character, her maternal grandfather. \n \n Universal holdover The Boy Next Door took No. 5 in its second outing with an estimated $6.1 million or more from 2,615 locations. \n \n The Loft, director Erik Van Looy's English-language remake of his 2008 Dutch film, quickly fell flat this weekend, coming in at No. 10 with a soft $2.9 million. From Dark Castle Entertainment, the thriller was originally supposed to be distributed by Warner Bros. per its deal with Joel Silver's Dark Castle, but it moved to Universal when Silver pacted with that studio. \n \n However, Open Road films subsequently announced it would release The Loft after Universal pulled the movie from its August 2014 release. The $14 million title, about a group of men who share a loft used for illicit affairs, stars James Marsden and Karl Urban, while Matthias Schoenaerts reprises his role from the original film. \n \n Note: Updated Monday morning with official box office grosses. ||||| Excellent perspective from one who served.

To all those who thought or think this is American propaganda, then you either did not read the book, your mind was made up before you started or you have not read any other memoirs from any other conflicts in the world. \n \n \n \n This is the insight of a man who was on the ground and answered the call of his country and performed to exemplary levels of honor, bravery and comradeship. You will find the same type of writing in \u201cLast Dead Hero\u201d- Robert Lamon, \u201cBlood Red Snow\u201d- Gunther K. Koschorrek, \u201cThe Forgotten Soldier\u201d Guy Sajer \u201cPatton\u201d Ladislas Farago and a host of others. These men fought for their country and sought to defeat and destroy the enemy. Plain and simple, waris about killing people to win. It\u2019s not a walk in the park and handled through diplomacy where everyone holds hands and smiles. War is ugly, destructive and dehumanizing. Ask the Russians how many they lost during World War Two. Ask the British if they had, as Neville Chamberlain proclaimed, \u201cPeace in our time.\u201d You win by killing your enemy! \n \n Chris gives the reader a frontline look at how the battle in Iraq was fought. Does he come across as inhumane? Perhaps. But as a sniper, his job isn\u2019t to sit back and observe, it\u2019s to protect his fellow soldiers in harms way. And he does this by killing the enemy. \n \n I have talked, not interviewed, many men who served in WWII, Korea, Vietnam and Iraq/Afghanistan. The common thread all of these men and women hold is, they are fighting for the man/woman by their side. Politics and grand strategies are the farthest thing from their minds. Protecting their fellow soldiers is front and foremost. \n \n His insight to his commanders is a common theme you\u2019ll find in most biographies-incompetent. His description of one of these, \u201c0% casualties, 100% effectiveness.\u201d galled him. How do you go out in the field to ambush or become a target for your foe and not expect to incur casualties? I\u2019m sure those were the words Eisenhower, Bradley, Montgomery, Patton, Truscott, Roosevelt, King, Schwarzkof and Franks told their men as they were going into the frey. No! \n \n The other side of this tribute is his family life. Was it all rose gardens and happy-go-lucky? Far from it. His wife Taya had her own battles to fight. She was responsible for raising their two children while he was off fighting. Her insights to their fiery, troubled relationship are well timed and placed through this work. She does not hold back how much she despises the military but also understands that her husband is bound and determined to keep the bad guys from coming to the states and making sure he does everything in his ability to make that happen. For her, it is a Catch-22. She loves her husband and is proud of his service, but sooner or later, he\u2019s going to have to make family number two on the list. When Chris realizes that he\u2019s not immortal during his last deployment and reenlistment is coming up, he will have to decide if he wants to continue his service which could result in him losing his family. He chooses the later. This alone is an excellent testament of two people not taking the easy road. They overcame their differences and remembered why they fell in love in the first place. \n \n \n \n I recommend this warrior\u2019s story to anyone who wants a glimpse into the day to day life of a man who is dedicated to his God, Country and Family. \n \n \n \n Five Stars",

Today, Roenigk and Kevin Robinson join Outside The Lines to discuss Dave Mirra's life and legacy. (6:54) \n \n BMX icon Dave Mirra, who died in February, suffered from the type of chronic brain damage that has shown up in the brains of dozens of football players, a University of Toronto neuropathologist has concluded. Multiple neuropathologists confirmed the diagnosis. \n \n Mirra is the first action sports athlete to be diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a neurodegenerative disease that can lead to dementia, memory loss and depression. He died on Feb. 4 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. \n \n The tau protein deposits found in Mirra's brain were indistinguishable from the kind that have been found in the brains of former football and hockey players with CTE, Dr. Lili-Naz Hazrati, the Toronto neuropathologist, told ESPN The Magazine. \n \n Editor's Picks Wife of Dave Mirra, first action sports athlete with CTE, discusses his last weeks and legacy BMX pioneer Dave Mirra is the first action sports athlete to be diagnosed with CTE. In an exclusive interview, his wife, Lauren Mirra, speaks about his diagnosis, his last weeks and his legacy. \n \n \"I couldn't tell the difference,\" she said. \"The trauma itself defines the disease, not how you got the trauma.\" \n \n The trademark tau protein deposits were found in the frontal and temporal lobes of Mirra's brain. \n \n \"It's assumed it is related to multiple concussions that happened years before,\" she said. \n \n Mirra, who was 41, suffered a fractured skull when a car hit him at age 19, and he dabbled in boxing after his retirement from BMX. But he also endured countless concussions during his BMX career, beginning at a young age. \n \n A legend in freestyle BMX, Mirra was the face of his sport to the mainstream. Until 2013, he owned the record for the most X Games medals in history with 24. He also had a successful video game series and hosted a show on MTV. After retiring from competitive BMX in 2011, Mirra competed in the sports of rallycross and triathlon. \n \n After his death, Mirra's family decided to have his brain studied for CTE. At the request of the Mirra family, Hazrati sent images of her prepared slides, without background information or Mirra's name attached, to additional U.S. and Canadian neuropathologists for their opinions. Each confirmed Hazrati's diagnosis of CTE. \n \n \"It validates what we have been thinking about brain injuries in boxers and football players,\" Hazrati said. \"The key is brain injury. Regardless of how you get it, through BMX or hockey, you are at risk for this.\" \n \n CTE is a progressive disease associated with repeated head trauma. Although long known to occur in boxers, it was not discovered in football players and other athletes until 2002. \n \n Mirra's widow, Lauren, received the diagnosis about her late husband in March. In an exclusive interview with ESPN The Magazine for its June 6 issue, she spoke about Mirra's diagnosis and legacy, and she detailed personality changes in his final year. \n \n \"I started to notice changes in his mood. And then it quickly started to get worse,\" Lauren said. \"He wasn't able to be present in any situation or conversation, so it was hard to be in a relationship with him to any degree. He was lost. I looked straight through him on a few occasions. And I was like, 'Where are you? Where are you? What is wrong?' \n \n \"This is the beginning of bringing awareness. It would be amazing if this is something we can detect in life one day. If we can detect it, prevent it, stop it, let's do all of the above.\" \n \n CTE can be diagnosed only after death, though many researchers are working on tests to diagnose it in the living. \n \n Mirra will be inducted into the National BMX Hall of Fame in Chula Vista, California, on June 11. He will also be honored June 4 during this year's X Games in Austin, Texas, with a new event named for him, the Dave Mirra BMX Park Best Trick competition. The winner will be awarded the Mirra Golden Pedal and prize money. \n \n ESPN owns and produces the X Games, which had no comment on Mirra's diagnosis. ||||| Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share BMX legend Dave Mirra suffered from CTE before his death in February, multiple neuropathologists have confirmed, according to ESPN.

He was found dead at the age of 41 on Feb. 4. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) \n \n In a decade-old video, BMX star Dave Mirra spoke of riding a bike in terms usually reserved for the priesthood. BMX wasn\u2019t just a trend, he said, but a vocation \u2014 and a life sentence. \n \n \u201cI was born in 1974 in a small town in upstate New York \u2014 a time when bicycle motocross was just about to blow up the scene,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the mid-\u201980s, freestyle BMX was the coolest thing I\u2019d ever seen. It was a movement, and I was part of it. Just about every kid across America was riding BMX. There was at a time in high school when most kids traded their bikes for a car. I had to make a choice: Follow them or follow my heart. \u2026 I just kept on riding. As far as I was concerned, I was sentenced to life.\u201d \n \n Now that Mirra \u2014 found dead Thursday of a gunshot wound in his truck at his home in Greenville, N.C. \u2014 has apparently killed himself, it\u2019s easy to forget the great dangers he faced everyday in pursuit of his calling. BMX bikers are in peril every time they compete or practice, defying gravity as casually as the rest of us change toner in the copier. \n \n [BMX icon Dave Mirra dead at 41 of apparent suicide] \n \n Or, sometimes, not: \n \n And, in his career, Mirra endured \u2014 and triumphed over \u2014 at least two terrible accidents that devastated his body and left him wondering whether he would ever compete again. \n \n In the first, he was just a pedestrian. In 1993, at age 19, Mirra \u2014 who had just gotten out of high school and gone pro \u2014 was leaving a club in Syracuse when a drunk driver plowed into him, fracturing his skull and dislocating his shoulder. \n \n \u201cA car going 45 hurts a lot more than you falling from 15 feet and hitting the ground,\u201d he later said. \u201cBut it all hurts.\u201d \n \n The accident left him with a blood clot in his brain. \n \n \u201cThey said that if I was a football player, they\u2019d never let me play again,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I wasn\u2019t going to let that control my destiny.\u201d Besides, giving up riding wasn\u2019t really an option \u2014 and there was no one to stop him. \n \n \u201cThey couldn\u2019t control what I did because it was an independent sport,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe at first I was a little nervous, but I missed it so much.\u201d \n \n Mirra was riding again within a year. \n \n \u201cThe blood clot went away real soon, and I was fine,\u201d he said. \u201cBasically, I just figured I\u2019d been riding my whole life and I\u2019m not going to stop now.\u201d \n \n Getting hit by a car wasn\u2019t really that different than getting hassled by squares, he said. \n \n \u201cIt was a setback, but something I overcame. It doesn\u2019t even mess with me at all,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s no different than that teacher in sixth grade telling me I wasn\u2019t going to go anywhere \u2014 a roadblock. In life there are obstacles you have to go through. Whatever it is, you overcome eventually. I\u2019m fortunate not to be hurt physically so that I can move on. Back then it was a big deal, but it\u2019s behind me.\u201d He also once noted: There was \u201cno brain damage that I know of.\u201d \n \n Although Mirra wasn\u2019t really the type to preach, the crash that almost ended his career certainly made him a fan of designated drivers. \n \n \u201cI haven\u2019t been involved in any public service announcements, but it is my stand that drunk driving is not safe, and I would urge people not to drink and drive,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth it.\u201d \n \n Mirra in 2005. (Nick Laham/Getty Images) \n \n In 2006, Mirra had another close call he later called his \u201cworst crash ever.\u201d \n \n \u201cIt was the first day of BMX park practice before the Summer X Games,\u201d he told Men\u2019s Fitness \u2014 a publication impressed by \u201cwhat extreme athletes put their bodies through\u201d \u2014 in 2007. \u201cI did a few practice runs and started to push it a little bit each time. The final hit was a mess. I missed the landing and came down flat. As I leaned back to suck it up, my ass hit the back tire, my bike instantly stopped, and I went straight over the bars to the ground. I basically fell 16 feet straight to my head. Just after I hit the ground, I thought for sure I broke all the ribs on the right side and my sternum was smashed. I couldn\u2019t breathe, so a collapsed lung crossed my mind. I knew something was wrong.\u201d \n \n It turned out Mirra had almost destroyed his liver. \n \n \u201cI ended up with a Grade 4 laceration on my liver \u2014 Grade 5 is the worst you can get,\u201d he said. \u201cI spent two days in ICU and had to stay off my bike for close to four months. The biggest challenge is getting back to 100 percent mentally. But after four months off my bike, I was ready to take some chances again. I spent so much time preparing myself in my mind to ride that I was ready to go when the time came.\u201d \n \n For a guy used to pushing his body to the limits, recovery demanded patience. \n \n \u201cI realized there\u2019s nothing you can do about an injury or having a bad day,\u201d he said of the healing process. \u201cMy mind-set right now is all about having fun when I\u2019m out riding and not putting too much pressure on myself. I\u2019ve won enough; I\u2019ve proved myself. Winning feels good \u2014 I\u2019m still out there riding my best and keeping up the standard for riding, and I don\u2019t plan on slowing down anytime soon. I\u2019m just focusing more on enjoying myself: staying positive and doing what I do best.\u201d \n \n If Mirra did take his own life, something tragic led him off of this positive path. But, when remembering the obstacles he did overcome, perhaps it\u2019s also best to remember his nickname: \u201cMiracle Man.\u201d",

A radio crew in the Pripyat exclusion zone spied the little guy wandering around and laid out some bread and meat for him, ABC News reports. Before they could say \"Carnegie Deli,\" the fox had deftly combined the disparate parts of his soon-to-be lunch into a five-layer sandwich, as seen in the video here. Also notable in the video: the animal's nonchalant attitude about his repast preparation and his admirers. The BBC points out the fox likely didn't seem fazed by the humans because it probably didn't know what to make of them either way: The disaster zone has been more or less abandoned by people since the 1986 explosion. Radio Free Europe adds there's apparently been a recent uptick in foxes, wolves, and bears in the area. (Meanwhile, wild boars affected by Chernobyl have been deemed radioactive.)",

    "document": "Study: 98% Of Us Will Sign Away Our Firstborn Because We Don\u2019t Read The Terms Of Service \n \n \u201cClick here if you have read and agree to the Terms of Service.\u201d How many times in your life \u2014 heck, how many times just this month, or this year \u2014 have you hovered over that little ticky box without bothering to click the TOS link first? Or scrolled straight to the bottom of a pop-up window with 17 pages of boring legalese in it, just to continue installation? If your answer is anything other than \u201call the times,\u201d you are in a very, very small minority. \n \n A new study from researchers at two universities has confirmed what most of us already anecdotally know: nobody\u2019s actually reading the fine print, even if they should. \n \n And how did the researchers find this, you may ask? By creating a fictitious social networking site that research participants signed up for. The privacy policy and terms of service for this fictitious site were modeled on existing documents on another social network (LinkedIn), and checked in at roughly 8000 and 4000 words respectively. \n \n But this fake site\u2019s policies included a few extra clauses that should have raised eyebrows. One had to do with data sharing, and specified that the site could share your information with the NSA \u201cand other security agencies in the United States and abroad.\u201d It also said that your data could be shared with any third parties, and as a result \u201ccould impact eligibility in\u2026 employment, financial service, univeristy, entrance, international travel, the criminal justice system, etc.\u201d \n \n The other said that participants agreed to sign over their firstborn, Rumpelstiltskin-style: \u201cIn addition to any monetary payment \u2026 all users of this site agree to immediately assign their first-born child\u201d to the site, it read. \u201cIf the user does not yet have children, this agreement will be enforceable until the year 2050.\u201d \n \n The researchers then asked open-ended questions to the participants asking if they had any concerns with the policies and sign-up options. \n \n 543 research participants signed up for the site. Of those, 399 skipped all the fine print entirely and just signed up blindly. For the remaining 144, the average time spent \u201creading\u201d the privacy policy was 73 seconds, and for the TOS, 51 seconds. \n \n Even the best speed-readers are not going to get through \u2014 and understand \u2014 8000 words of legalese in 73 seconds, and these participants were no exception. In the end, the researchers found that 98% of all participants completely missed the existence of the \u201cgotcha\u201d clauses. That means a total of 10-11 participants, at most, actually noticed. \n \n Research participants were all undergrads, as is very common for university-based research. But this behavior is far from limited to young adults. A similar experiment in the UK in 2014 found the same results, with users unwittingly signing away their firstborn in exchange for access to a free WiFi hotspot. A UK-based retailer found the same in 2010 when their customers happily, and unwittingly, signed over their immortal souls. \n \n Other studies have found that barely one in five internet users actually read the terms, and even they probably don\u2019t usually stop to process the words. \n \n So yes, we should all read a little more carefully before we proceed \u2014 because as long as they disclose it, a company can do pretty much anything they want with your account or personal information. Of course, it doesn\u2019t help that the policies are usually long, dense, complicated, formatted badly, and full of legalese. There are some tools that help but when it comes to comprehensibility, we still have a long way to go. \n \n [via Ars Technica] ||||| 37 Pages Posted: 2 Apr 2016 Last revised: 18 Aug 2018 \n \n Date Written: June 1, 2018 \n \n Abstract \n \n This paper addresses \u2018the biggest lie on the internet\u2019 with an empirical investigation of privacy policy (PP) and terms of service (TOS) policy reading behavior. An experimental survey (N=543) assessed the extent to which individuals ignored PP and TOS when joining a fictitious social networking service, NameDrop. Results reveal 74% skipped PP, selecting the \u2018quick join\u2019 clickwrap. Average adult reading speed (250-280 words per minute), suggests PP should have taken 29-32 minutes and TOS 15-17 minutes to read. For those that didn\u2019t select the clickwrap, average PP reading time was 73 seconds. All participants were presented the TOS and had an average reading time of 51 seconds. Most participants agreed to the policies, 97% to PP and 93% to TOS, with decliners reading PP 30 seconds longer and TOS 90 seconds longer. A regression analysis identifies information overload as a significant negative predictor of reading TOS upon signup, when TOS changes, and when PP changes. Qualitative findings suggest that participants view policies as nuisance, ignoring them to pursue the ends of digital production, without being inhibited by the means. Implications are revealed as 98% missed NameDrop TOS \u2018gotcha clauses\u2019 about data sharing with the NSA and employers, and about providing a first-born child as payment for SNS access.",

The other 144 spent an average of 73 seconds reading the privacy policy and 51 seconds reading the terms of service. Based on average reading speed, it should have taken 30 minutes and 16 minutes respectively. In the end, 98% of participants didn't notice any of the onerous clauses in NameDrops's terms.

(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall) (Associated Press) \n \n The former Massachusetts governor watched on television with his wife, Ann, at a hotel suite across the street from the convention hall as delegates sealed his hard-won victories in the primaries and caucuses of last winter. \n \n New Jersey put him over the top in a ritual roll call of the states. \n \n Republican mockery of President Barack Obama began almost instantly from the podium at a convention postponed once and dogged still by Hurricane Isaac. The Democratic president has \"never run a company. He hasn't even run a garage sale or seen the inside of a lemonade stand,\" declared Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican Party. \n \n To send Romney and ticketmate Paul Ryan into the fall campaign, the convention quickly approved a conservative platform that calls for tax cuts _ not government spending _ to stimulate the economy at a time of sluggish growth and 8.3 percent unemployment. \n \n Ann Romney's speech was scheduled as a prime-time highlight, an appearance meant to cast her multimillionaire-businessman-turned-politician husband in a soft and likable light before a national TV audience. \n \n Aides said Romney would be in the hall when she spoke. \n \n While there was no doubt about Romney's command over the convention, the residue of a heated campaign for the nomination was evident inside the hall. \n \n Texas Rep. Ron Paul, who never won a primary or caucus, drew several dozen delegate votes. Earlier, his supporters chanted and booed after the convention adopted rules they opposed, but were powerless to block, to prevent those votes from being officially registered. \n \n Opinion polls made the race a close one as the Republicans' days of pageantry and speechmaking began in earnest, and the man tapped to deliver the keynote address set the stakes. \n \n \"Conventions are always huge for a challenger, because they're the ones introducing themselves\" to the voters, said New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. \n \n Convention planners squeezed two days of speeches and other convention business into one after scrapping Monday's scheduled opener because of fears that Isaac would make a direct hit on the Florida Gulf Coast. \n \n That threat fizzled, but it was instantly replaced by another _ that Republicans would wind up holding a political celebration at the same time the storm turned its fury on New Orleans, devastated almost exactly seven years ago by Hurricane Katrina. \n \n Romney's convention planners said they were in frequent contact with weather forecasters, but they declined to discuss what contingency plans, if any, they had to accelerate plans for him to deliver a formal acceptance speech Thursday night. \n \n \"This is obviously the biggest speech of my life,\" Mrs. Romney said as she visited the custom-made podium to prepare for her remarks. \n \n Ratification of a party platform was prelude to Romney's nomination, a document more conservative on abortion than the candidate. \n \n On economic matters, it backs extension of the tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 and due to expire at year's end, without exception. It also calls for an additional 20 percent reduction in income tax brackets that Romney favors. \n \n In a time of 8.3 percent unemployment and the slowest economic recovery in the post-World War II era, that went to the crux of the campaign for the White House. \n \n By contrast, Obama wants to allow existing tax cuts to expire on upper income taxpayers, and has criticized Romney's overall economic plans as a boon to millionaires that would raise taxes on the middle class. \n \n The GOP platform also pledges that a Republican-controlled Congress will repeal, and Romney will sign, legislation to repeal the health care legislation Obama won from a Democratic-controlled Congress. So, too, for the measure passed to regulate Wall Street in the wake of the 2008 economic collapse. \n \n On abortion, the platform says, \"The unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed.\" \n \n Romney opposes abortions, except in cases of rape, incest, or when \"the health and life of the mother\" are at stake, he said in a convention week interview. \n \n Obama, who accepts renomination at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., next week, campaigned in Iowa Tuesday as he set out on a tour of college campuses in battleground states in hopes of boosting voter registration among college students. \n \n Before departing the White House, he made a point of appearing before reporters to announce the government's latest steps to help those in the way of Isaac. He signed a declaration of emergency for Mississippi and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local storm response efforts in the state. \n \n His surrogates did their best to counter Romney and the Republicans. \n \n Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, dismissing GOP attempts to woo Hispanic voters, said, \"You can't just trot out a brown face or a Spanish surname and expect people are going to vote for your party or your candidate.\" He added, \"This is a party with a platform that calls for the self-deportation of 11 million people.\" \n \n Hispanics strongly favor Obama, according to public polls, and Romney and his party have been seeking to win a bigger share of their votes by emphasizing proposals to fix the economy rather than ease their positions on immigration. \n \n Female voters, too, prefer the president over his challenger, and Democrats have done their best to emphasize GOP opposition to abortion and even suggest the party might try and curtail access to contraceptives if it wins power. \n \n Whatever the impact of those issues, the polls show the economy is overwhelmingly the dominant issue in the race, and on that, the voters narrowly say they trust Romney more. \n \n In an AP-GfK poll taken Aug. 16-20, some 48 percent of registered voters said they trust Romney more on economic issues, to 44 percent for Obama. \n \n However, a Washington Post-ABC News in the days immediately before the convention found that 61 percent of registered voters said Obama was more likable, and 27 percent said Romney. \n \n The convention took place in an atmosphere of security that was both stringent and selective. Thousands of police from all over the country, joined by National Guard troops, Secret Service and others, stood in small groups at checkpoints, demanding those entering a secure area display proper credentials numerous times. \n \n But former Michigan Gov. John Engler and an aide were hustled to the front of a long line waiting to clear security at one building. \n \n Aside from Paul, Romney's long-ago rivals for the party nomination had bit roles at his convention, if that. \n \n Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain posed for a photo after running into each other at the convention center. Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum were also in town, as well, both with speaking slots, unlike Bachmann and Cain. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Brian Bakst, Thomas Beaumont, Tamara Lush, Brendan Farrington, Julie Mazziotta, Steve Peoples, Kasie Hunt and Philip Elliott in Florida and Steven Ohlemacher, Alicia A.

Carter was roughed up while wearing a similar chicken outfit at a 2010 BHS pep rally skit meant to mock Clovis West school\u2019s mascot, the Golden Eagles. \n \n The Kern High School District agreed Wednesday to pay $10.5 million to a former student injured in a violent dog pile that broke out during a 2010 Bakersfield High School pep rally, cutting short an ongoing civil trial that threatened to cost the district\u2019s insurance company even more money. \n \n The student, Mitch Carter, will use that money for healthcare-related costs, his trial attorney Nicholas Rowley said during a press conference outside Kern County Superior Court. \n \n A jury had already found the district liable for Carter\u2019s injuries, which his lawyers said included brain damage. It was in the process of determining monetary damages and was expected to award more than $45 million, Rowley said based on interviews his side conducted with jurors in court Wednesday. \n \n \u201cThey would have given him more, but the school district would have appealed,\u201d Rowley said, adding the appeals process could have lasted years. Carter needs that money now, he said. \n \n The district\u2019s insurance company, New Jersey-based Everest National Insurance Company, will pay the lion\u2019s share of that $10.5 million settlement, Rowley said. \n \n \u201cNo matter what, I'd trade everything just to have a full functioning brain,\u201d Carter said outside court Wednesday. \u201cBut I think that this is a good step in the right direction.\u201d \n \n INEXCUSABLE BUT A SURPRISE \n \n Carter was mobbed by a group of students in 2010 when he put on a chicken costume meant to mock an opposing team\u2019s mascot during a pep rally the day of a championship football game. Members of the football team pounced on him, punching, kicking and leaping onto a dog pile that Carter has said left him with a traumatic brain injury. \n \n Jurors found the district negligent. \n \n Defense attorney Michael Kellar on Wednesday described what happened to Carter in 2010 as \u201cembarrassing and inexcusable,\u201d and that it never should have occurred, \u201cbut came as a total surprise and sudden surprise to school staff.\u201d \n \n He said KHSD\u2019s insurance company made the decision to settle, wanting to reduce the risk of an even higher jury award than the $10.5 million. \n \n In an emailed statement, KHSD officials said they will reevaluate their safety policies in light of the incident and accept responsibility. \n \n \u201cWe understand the reasons why Self-Insured Schools of California and the excess insurance carrier chose to settle this case,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThe District is going to take this opportunity to evaluate its standards, policies and practices to ensure that every student is educated in a safe and secure environment \u2014 because every parent and student should expect nothing less. \n \n \u201cWe sincerely wish Mr. Carter and his family all the best as they move forward.\u201d \n \n The settlement ended a seven-day civil trial that shed light on shoddy safety practices at Kern High School District, revealed questionable policies and disorganization between the KHSD Police Department and school administrators, was fraught with accusations of conspiracy and cover-up and concluded with a lawyer donning a chicken suit in court. \n \n At one point, when Kellar made an objection asking what the \u201cchicken dance\u201d was early in the trial, Rowley came close to demonstrating it in court. \n \n \u201cDo we need to go over what the chicken dance is?\u201d Rowley asked. \n \n A CHANGE IN POLICY \n \n When Carter stepped into his chicken suit Dec 10, 2010, his attorneys said he became part of a tradition at Bakersfield High School. That tradition is one where students or teachers are asked to dress up in a costume of the opposing team's mascot and take a beating before a big game. \n \n It happened to teacher Bob Stone in 2005, they said, something defense attorneys attempted to have excluded as evidence. \n \n Rowley said he's confident the jury's verdict and the settlement will force KHSD to change policy and never allow this to happen again or else \u201cwe'll be at that next school board meeting. \n \n \u201cWhen a jury speaks, people listen,\u201d he said. \n \n Carter's lead attorney, Ralph Wegis, had in the past turned down settlement offers of $50,000 and $1 million before the trial began June 16. \n \n KHSD IS \u2018DESPICABLE\u2019 \n \n Rowley, who questioned the majority of witnesses, said he bears \u201cno bad blood\u201d with Bakersfield High School. But Wegis, who has called the district's actions \u201cdespicable,\u201d won't be satisfied until administration reorganizes, he said. \n \n \u201cIt's going to continue to be despicable until I hear from the school district that we have fired somebody and we have fired them because that's not who we want to be in the future,\u201d Wegis said. \n \n He'd start by eliminating top administrators, he said, and terminating anyone who lied during the trial. That includes Bakersfield High School Head Football Coach Paul Golla, whom Wegis says he was able to impeach as a witness. \n \n Golla testified Thursday that he wasn\u2019t in the gym when the dog pile took place. But a scout from USC testified Monday that he watched the dog pile form and was sitting next to Golla at the time. \n \n \u201cI would go down with every single person that had their fingerprints on this, so everybody who doesn't have their fingerprints on it says you could lose your job if safety isn't No. 1,\u201d Wegis said. \u201cIf you lie in court you could lose your job. That\u2019s not the example we're setting for our children.\u201d \n \n Rowley told reporters Wednesday that there \u201cwas some confusion\u201d when Golla said he was not in the gym. Kellar remains steadfast in his Golla\u2019s testimony. \n \n \u201cHe said he wasn't there. So I'm taking him at his word, and you know, there may be some misunderstanding from the other coach as to when they did leave or if Golla left before him or if Coach Golla's attention was distracted somewhere else,\u201d Kellar said. \n \n That testimony, however, didn\u2019t play a significant role in determining the district\u2019s liability, Kellar said. \n \n \u201cI think it's incorrect to assign any claim that these employees lied or intentionally misled. Because I think that\u2019s just the opposite and they had nothing to gain by it,\u201d Kellar said. \n \n CONSPIRACY THEORY \u2018RIDICULOUS\u2019 \n \n Meanwhile, during his closing statements, Rowley accused the district of carrying on a \u201cconspiracy\u201d and \u201ccover-up.\u201d \n \n Neither Golla nor BHS Activities Director Anna Lovan saw the dog pile form, they both testified. The lone KHSD police officer investigating the matter hadn\u2019t seen the witness reports taken by school administrators until he was presented with them during the trial. \n \n BHS Principal David Reese testified that he had no advance knowledge that a chicken suit would be used in a pep rally skit, but Lovan testified later that he approved it. \n \n This was all orchestrated, Rowley asserted during trial. \n \n Kellar called that assertion \u201cridiculous\u201d Wednesday. \n \n \u201cThere was no conspiracy,\u201d Kellar said. \u201cThere may have been some lack of appreciation for what went down in the gym because the principal wasn't there, there was no video available immediately and Miss Lovan's view was obstructed in the initial moments of the dog pile.\u201d \n \n Rowley painted a picture during the trial of a school obsessed with football, creating a culture where star players are looked on as gods and protected by administrators. Students testified to that. \n \n When Carter turned in a starting player who he said was stealing from backpacks, and later stole Carter\u2019s wallet while he was in the shower, Golla shined him off, he testified. Golla offered Carter $20 from his wallet as consolation and didn\u2019t discipline the player, Carter said. \n \n \u201cHe's not 'Mitch the snitch' anymore, or the kid in the chicken suit,\u201d Rowley said Wednesday. \u201cHe's somebody who stood up for himself in our justice system and made the world a safer place.\u201d \n \n Carter said he hopes to someday attend law school so he can stand up for those who need their voices heard. \n \n \u201cI had a great man stand up for me when no one else would,\u201d Carter said. \u201cI\u2019d love to do that and stand up for the kid who needs to be stood up for.\u201d ||||| Midway through the skit but before the public beating, Carter had tried to stop his performance. After two students hit and knocked him over, he told a school administrator that he would not continue wearing the chicken costume, Rowley said.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A California man whose life was forever altered by donning a chicken suit for a high school pep rally has been awarded a lot more than chicken scratch in a lawsuit against Kern High School District. Mitch Carter was a 17-year-old student at Bakersfield High School in 2010 when he dressed up in the suit to mock the Golden Hawk mascot of arch-rival Golden West High School for an ill-fated skit, the Los Angeles Times reports. Students\u2014including plenty of football players\u2014piled on top of him, delivering kicks and punches in a beating that lawyers said left Carter with a traumatic brain injury. After a jury found the district liable for his injuries, it decided to settle with him for $10.5 million, most of which will be covered by insurance. Lawyers said Carter, once an honor roll student, has struggled with depression and poor grades in college since the beating. His future medical care costs will be more than $5 million, according to the lawyers. \"I would trade everything just to have a full functioning brain,\" he said after the award was announced.

    "document": "AUSTIN \u2014 Abortion rights advocates made a final push Wednesday against proposed state rules that would require abortion providers to cremate or bury fetal remains. \n \n Opponents of the rules, led by abortion rights advocacy group NARAL Pro-Choice Texas, rallied outside the Department of State Health Services building and delivered more than 5,500 signatures from people who oppose the proposal. \n \n Since the rules were proposed in July, several abortion rights advocates and abortion providers have vocalized their concerns, saying the requirements could be costly and create more obstacles for people obtaining abortions. \n \n \"The rules target physicians that provide abortions and the hospitals that care for patients for no reason other than to make it harder to get a safe, legal abortion in Texas,\" said Blake Rocap, legislative counsel for NARAL Pro-Choice Texas. \"It's so transparent that what they're really trying to do is denying access to abortion.\" \n \n The rules, which were introduced by the Department of State Health Services, would require all medical facilities, hospitals and clinics to cremate or bury fetal remains, no matter the period of gestation. \n \n After taking public comments this summer, the department resubmitted updated rules with an analysis of financial impact. The department also added an additional month for people to submit their opinions. The new comment period ends Monday. The department has not said when the rules would take effect if adopted. \n \n Department spokeswoman Carrie Williams said the agency found that cost shouldn't be a concern for hospitals and abortion providers. \n \n \"What we found through our research is that the proposed rules won't increase total costs for healthcare facilities,\" Williams said in an email. \"While the methods described in the new rules may have a cost, that cost is expected to be offset by costs currently being spent by facilities on disposition for transportation, storage, incineration, steam disinfection and/or landfill disposal.\" \n \n Abortion providers generally use third-party special waste services to dispose of the remains in sanitary landfills. Current rules allow for fetal tissue, blood, organs and other body parts to be discarded, incinerated or ground, and then disposed of in a sanitary landfill. \n \n The change would ban those specific methods for fetal tissue, but the rules would still apply for other body parts or organs. \n \n Geraldine Mongold, a software manager from Austin, attended the rally Wednesday and said the proposed rules could be complicated to enforce. \n \n \"It creates an undue burden on women who either have an abortion or a miscarriage,\" Mongold said. \"It's a slippery slope, too. ... They're taking away our rights to own our own bodily fluids and products.\" \n \n After the end of the comment period, the department will need to approve the final rules. The changes might not require approval by the Legislature, as they wouldn't be in statute. Lawmakers grant some state agencies the power to adopt rules with \"specific rule making authority.\" ||||| \n \n Pro-choice supporters rally outside the Supreme Court before the June 2016 court ruling in a case that imposed heavy restrictions on abortion clinics in Texas and was struck down. (Michael Reynolds/European Pressphoto Agency) \n \n After months of fierce opposition from abortion rights advocates and the medical community, Texas will require fetal remains to be cremated or buried instead of disposed in sanitary landfills. \n \n On Monday, health officials finalized the new rules prohibiting hospitals, abortion clinics and other health care facilities from disposing of fetal remains \u2014 regardless of the period of gestation. The rules will take effect Dec. 19, according to state health officials, the Texas Tribune reported. \n \n Following criticism from medical providers, the state\u2019s Health and Human Services Commission clarified that the requirement does not apply to miscarriages or abortions that take place at home. It also does not require birth or death certificates to be filed, to maintain confidentiality. \n \n The move comes after months of public comment periods, hearings and more than 35,000 comments submitted to health officials since the rules were first proposed in early July. With little notice, Gov. Greg Abbott (R) approved the proposal, saying that he does not believe fetal remains should be \u201ctreated like medical waste and disposed of in landfills,\u201d the Texas Tribune reported. \n \n The health commission has said the rules will result in \u201cenhanced protection of the health and safety of the public.\u201d Meanwhile, reproductive rights activists say the rules are unnecessary and make it more difficult for a woman to get a safe, legal abortion in the state. \n \n \u201cThe rules target physicians that provide abortions and the hospitals that care for patients,\u201d said Blake Rocap, legislative counsel for advocacy group NARAL Pro-Choice Texas, the Dallas Morning News reported. \u201cIt\u2019s so transparent that what they\u2019re really trying to do is denying access to abortion.\u201d The group rallied outside the Department of State Health Services in late October and delivered more than 5,500 signatures from individuals in opposition to the proposal. \n \n Others in the medical and funeral industries criticized the costs that would be associated with cremating or burying fetal remains \u2014 a process that can cost hospitals and abortion providers several thousands dollars in each case. But department spokeswoman Carrie Williams said the cost shouldn\u2019t be a concern. \n \n \u201cWhat we found through our research is that the proposed rules won\u2019t increase total costs for healthcare facilities,\u201d Williams said in an email, the Dallas Morning News reported. \u201cWhile the methods described in the new rules may have a cost, that cost is expected to be offset by costs currently being spent by facilities on disposition for transportation, storage, incineration, steam disinfection and/or landfill disposal.\u201d \n \n [Supreme Court rules against Texas and for science in abortion case] \n \n Abortion providers generally use third-party special waste services to dispose of fetal remains. Previous rules allowed fetal remains, along with other medical tissue, to be ground up and discharged into a sewer system, incinerated, or handled by some other approved process before being disposed of in a landfill. \n \n David Brown, senior staff attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, on Monday said the rule was \u201can unnecessary burden and an intrusion\u201d on a woman\u2019s personal beliefs. \u201cThese new restrictions reveal the callous indifference that Texas politicians have toward women,\u201d Brown said, the Texas Tribune reported. \n \n Stephanie Toti, senior counsel for the center, said in a statement, \u201cTexas politicians are at it again, inserting their personal beliefs into the health care decisions of Texas women.\u201d \n \n Meanwhile, several Republican lawmakers in the state have expressed support for the proposed rule. \n \n \u201cFor far too long, Texas has allowed the most innocent among us to be thrown out with the daily waste,\u201d state Sen. Don Huffines (R-Dallas) said in a packed public hearing on the proposed rule in August, the Austin American-Statesman reported. \u201cLife begins at conception.\u201d \n \n Women who attended the hearing in August provided testimonials with mixed responses and personal details. One woman said she felt a great deal of closure burying a fetus after she had a miscarriage. Another said she had an abortion after she was raped, and that if she had been forced to bury the fetus it would have \u201cessentially been the state of Texas rubbing my face in my own rape.\u201d \n \n Some groups, like the Center for Reproductive Rights, have said they would likely challenge the new rules in court. Because the rules fall under the rulemaking authority of the state health department, they do not need legislative approval. But Republican lawmakers have already filed legislation to write the rules into statutory law when the legislature reconvenes in January, the Texas Tribune reported. \n \n [How restrictive are abortion regulations in your state?] \n \n Other states have passed restrictions on the use of fetal remains. South Dakota made it illegal to use aborted fetal tissue in research. In Idaho and Alabama it is illegal to buy, sell, donate or experiment on such remains. \n \n A law in Indiana, among other things, also called for abortion providers to bury or cremate fetal tissue. Additionally, it would have prohibited abortions sought solely because a fetus had been potentially diagnosed with a disability such as Down syndrome. But in June, a federal judge suspended the law from going into effect, finding that it violated U.S. Supreme Court precedents protecting a woman\u2019s right to choose an abortion and the right to privacy in making that decision, the Indianapolis Star reported. \n \n [A Catholic priest put an aborted fetus on the altar in an appeal for Donald Trump] \n \n As Emma Green wrote in the Atlantic, legal guidelines for organ and tissue use are somewhat of a murky area.

Instead, they'll be required to bury or cremate the remains, no matter the gestational age\u2014a move spurring \"intense outcry\" from reproductive rights advocates, as well as from medical providers. \"The state [Health and Human Services Commission] has once again ignored the concerns of the medical community and thousands of Texans by playing politics with people's private health-care decisions,\" Heather Busby, director of NARAL Pro-Choice Texas, says in a statement. But health officials say they've addressed the major concerns brought up during what the Washington Post calls \"months of controversy\" since the initial July proposal. In terms of privacy, birth or death certificates aren't required, and miscarriages or abortions at home don't have to comply. As for the costs, the medical care facilities will pay, with costs \"offset by the elimination of some current methods of disposition,\" per the health department. The commission notes the rules will lead to \"enhanced protection of the health and safety of the public,\" but women's rights advocates say it's nothing more than a veiled attempt to restrict abortion access, per the Dallas Morning News. \"These new restrictions reveal the callous indifference that Texas politicians have toward women,\" a Center for Reproductive Rights lawyer says, adding the rules will \"almost certainly trigger costly litigation,\" per the Tribune.",

Opponents of the rules, led by abortion rights advocacy group NARAL Pro-Choice Texas, rallied outside the Department of State Health Services building. \"It's so transparent that what they're really trying to do is denying access to abortion,\" said Blake Rocap, legislative counsel for NARal Pro-choice Texas. 'It creates an undue burden on women who either have an abortion or a miscarriage,' said Geraldine Mongold, a software manager from Austin.",

(Associated Press) \n \n Until this summer, Hatch, 78, had not faced a primary challenge since winning office in 1976. Former state Sen. Dan Liljenquist, who survived a 2008 plane crash in Guatemala that killed 11 of 14 on board, won just enough support at the state GOP's nominating convention to advance to the primary. \n \n But Liljenquist faced an overwhelming financial and organizational disadvantage. Hatch, learning from the defeat two years ago of his Senate colleague Robert Bennett, spent about $10 million blanketing the airwaves and building a campaign operation unlike anything Utah had seen before. \n \n Hatch's race was the premier event in Tuesday's primaries. In New York, 82-year-old Rep. Charlie Rangel won the Democratic primary in spite of a House censure 18 months ago for failing to pay all his taxes and for filing misleading financial disclosure statements. \n \n In Oklahoma, Rep. John Sullivan was in a close contest against political newcomer Jim Bridenstine, who ran to Sullivan's right and criticized the incumbent for missing hundreds of House votes in the past decade. \n \n A few months ago, Hatch was considered vulnerable like Bennett and six-term Republican Sen. Richard Lugar, who lost in last month's Indiana GOP primary. But Hatch got a huge endorsement from Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who said he would need Hatch in the Senate if he wins the presidency. \n \n Romney easily won his final presidential primary Tuesday as GOP voters in Utah relished the chance to show their support for the Brigham Young University graduate. \n \n Hatch seemed to have an answer to every criticism in his quest for a seventh term. For those who said that 36 years in office was enough, he said that he wouldn't be running again if it weren't for the opportunity to serve as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee if the GOP wins control of the Senate. He also announced it would be his last term. \n \n For those who said he wasn't conservative enough, he gravitated to the right with his comments and his votes, scoring a 100 percent rating from the American Conservative Union in 2010 and 2011. His lifetime rating of 89 percent from the ACU would place Hatch among the Senate's most conservative lawmakers, but Hatch at times took stands that didn't sit well with the right. He worked with the late Sen. Edward M. Kennedy to establish a health insurance program for poor and moderate-income children. He also voted to establish a prescription drug benefit under Medicare and to rescue financial firms facing bankruptcy without government help. \n \n Liljenquist, 37, a relative newcomer to the Utah political scene, seized on voters' concerns about the growing national debt and tried to make the case that Hatch had been a major contributor to that debt. \n \n Hatch was widely viewed as most vulnerable when about 4,000 GOP stalwarts gathered at the state's nominating convention in April. Delegates at the convention tend to be more conservative than the GOP electorate, and the Hatch campaign team spent months trying to generate a new crop of delegates. That work paid off, with the large majority of delegates being new to the process. In the end, Hatch won 59.2 percent of the delegates, just shy of the 60 percent he needed to avoid a runoff with Liljenquist. \n \n The Hatch campaign included many of the state's top political consultants and strategists. It also hired some of the tea party activists who had helped generate Sen. Mike Lee's victory two years ago. \n \n With the primary victory, Hatch was a huge favorite to win the general election in November against Democratic candidate Scott Howell. \n \n ___ \n \n Freking reported from Washington. Associated Press writers Beth Fouhy in New York and Anne Gearan in Washington contributed to this report. ||||| NEW YORK \u2013 Rep. Charles Rangel survived the toughest reelection fight of his career, overcoming health and ethics troubles to extend his four-decade run in the House with a win in the New York primary Tuesday night. \n \n With nearly 84 percent of precincts reporting, Rangel was ahead of state Sen. Adriano Espaillat by slightly more than 5 percentage points, and the Associated Press declared him the winner. In a statement just before midnight, Espaillat conceded and congratulated Rangel. \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset \n \n Appearing with supporters at his Harlem victory party Tuesday evening, Rangel, 82, did not address how much longer he plans to serve in the House, only saying that he\u2019s committed to the next two-year term. \n \n \u201cThere are just too many people who have put their trust and confidence in me and President Obama in this great country,\u201d said Rangel, who withstood a similar primary challenge in 2010. \u201cWe face real challenges.\u201d \n \n The race was the most closely watched House primary of the night, but voters in five states cast ballots. The most surprising result came in Oklahoma, where GOP Rep. John Sullivan lost the seat he has held since 2002 to a little-known, tea party-backed opponent. \n \n In another closely-watched House race in the Empire State, state Assemblyman Hakeem Jeffries crushed New York councilman Charles Barron, a former Black Panther with a history of fiery rhetoric whose candidacy spooked the Democratic establishment. \n \n Rangel\u2019s triumph marked his latest display of survival instincts. He was dogged by a bad back and ethics controversy and managed to overcome a redistricting process that forced him to fight for reelection on less friendly political terrain. \n \n But in the campaign\u2019s final weeks, the co-founder of the Congressional Black Caucus, who was first elected in 1970, made it very clear he still had some fight, staring down his opponents and lambasting the press corps for its coverage of him. \n \n His defiance continued through the final hours of the campaign. \n \n Dressed in a crisp blue suit and red tie and pocket square and accompanied by his wife, Alma, Rangel arrived at a Harlem polling station at around 11 a.m. to cast his ballot. He expressed confidence and said he hadn\u2019t given much thought to the idea that he could come up short. \n \n \u201cIf I lose tonight I will sleep just like a baby and cry myself to sleep,\u201d Rangel said. \u201cIf you have the spirit that\u2019s necessary to overcome these political obstacles, and if you\u2019re fortunate to know that they\u2019re not obstacles that you can\u2019t overcome, then the attitude of \u2018What do I do if I lose?\u2019 never reaches that level.\u201d \n \n Rangel\u2019s career was put in jeopardy after a 2010 ethics investigation that culminated in him being censured on the House floor. That year, he easily defeated several primary opponents who sought to exploit his political problems. \n \n Adding to his problems, earlier this year his seat was refashioned to include more Latino voters than blacks. That gave an opening to Rangel\u2019s lead primary opponent, Espaillat, a 57-year-old state senator who is Dominican American. Making matters worse, Rangel had to compete with three lesser known black candidates who threatened to siphon African American votes from him. \n \n And the incumbent was incapacitated for three months this year by health problems, including a bad back and a viral infection. Rangel revealed last week that he had been receiving a daily IV infusion of antibiotics. \n \n But on Tuesday, Rangel said he had shown he\u2019s just fine.",

(Associated Press) \n \n CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Chicago police said charges could be announced soon in the fatal shooting of an Illinois congressman's grandson following an argument over a pair of basketball shoes. \n \n Officer Michelle Tannehill said two juveniles are in custody and are considered suspects in the killing of 15-year-old Javon Wilson, who was shot in the head at his home in Chicago on Friday. Wilson is the grandson of longtime U.S. Rep. Danny Davis. \n \n \"The detectives are continuing their interrogations and charges are expected,\" Tannehill said on Saturday night. The juveniles in custody have not been identified. \n \n Police earlier said the shooting stemmed from a dispute over basketball shoes. Wilson knew his attackers and they may have been friends at some point. \n \n Davis said he was told that a 15-year-old boy had traded slacks for shoes with Wilson's 14-year-old brother, but thought better of the trade and went to Wilson's house with a 17-year-old girl. He said the pair forced their way in the house and argued with Wilson before the boy pulled a gun and fired. \n \n Davis, a Democratic member of the House for 20 years, told The Associated Press on Saturday that his grandson was a victim of a world where gun violence has become commonplace. \n \n \"It's almost, just the way it is. People think nothing of it,\" Davis said. \n \n \"Youngsters invariably say, 'I know a lot of guys who've got guns. I know a lot of girls who've got guns,'\" Davis said. \"It becomes a part of the culture of an environment that has got to change.\" \n \n Chicago has seen a dramatic rise in the number of shootings and homicides, with August being the deadliest month in the city in two decades. There have been 673 homicides so far this year, including the fatal shootings of the cousin of Chicago Bulls basketball star Dwyane Wade, a Chicago police officer's son and the son of a famed percussionist. \n \n Davis, who was re-elected this month to his 11th term in the 7th Congressional District and is a former Chicago alderman, was in Chicago on Friday and spoke with reporters after talking to police. He wondered how the shooter obtained the gun and said he'd continue to try to combat gun violence. \n \n Davis said his grandson was \"a pretty regular kid\" who loved playing basketball and knew all the pros and their stats, who also loved music and whose grades were improving after a rough patch. \n \n \"The question becomes where does a 15-year-old obtain a gun? Who let the 15-year-old have a gun and under what circumstances?\" Davis asked. \"There's no answer for that except that the availability of guns is so prevalent in America to the point where you almost can't tell who has a gun\" anymore. ||||| Two juvenile murder suspects have been taken into custody in the slaying of U.S. Rep.

The teen\u2019s mother had left the home to pick up food. \n \n During the argument, one of the assailants, a 15-year-old boy, pulled out a gun and shot Jovan in the head. A 17-year-old girl was the other assailant, Davis said. \n \n \u201cHe was a typical 15-year-old,\u201d the Democratic congressman said of his grandson. \u201cHe liked basketball. If you listened to him he was a basketball star, but he liked basketball and music. All those kinds of things. He was an avid sports fan, he knew all about, you know, the stats of different players.\u201d \n \n Davis had just returned to Chicago from Washington, D.C., and was in his office when his son Stacey Wilson, the boy\u2019s father, called him with the news of the shooting. \n \n He said he might never know the answer to those questions or if there was anything, such as better education, that could have prevented his grandson\u2019s homicide. \u201cI do know that I grieve for my family,\u201d Davis said at a news conference. \u201cI grieve for the young man who pulled the trigger. I grieve for his family, his parents, his friends, some of whom will never see him again.\u201d \n \n Davis said gun violence is a problem society deals with every day and reflected on how he\u2019s attended multiple funerals for other slain teenagers. \n \n \u201cI guess that I always knew that the possibility existed that it could happen close to me,\u201d Davis said. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I thought it was so unfortunate because Jovan had just reached a point, 15, his grades had improved at school. His father had just told me about how proud of him that he was because he was catching on and realizing that all of his life was in front of him.\u201d \n \n The family had talked to the teen about staying at home at night. Still, that didn\u2019t spare him from violence, Davis said. \u201cUnfortunately, here he was in the house at home, minding his own business, and some intruders would come and snuff his life away.\u201d \n \n The boy\u2019s father, teary-eyed, stood next to Davis during the news conference.

    "document": "The winner of the unusually spirited Republican contest was Joseph J. Lhota, a no-nonsense former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. He defeated John A. Catsimatidis, a voluble billionaire who ran an often whimsical campaign. \n \n Mr. Lhota, who served as deputy mayor to Rudolph W. Giuliani, will carry his tough-minded approach to crime-fighting and city spending into the general election on Nov. 5. A vocal supporter of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s policies, Mr. Lhota called his victory \u201cthe first step in continuing a strong future for our city.\u201d \n \n By contrast, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s vow to make a clean break from the Bloomberg era struck a chord with Democratic voters worried about jobs and schools. Roughly three in four wanted to move the city in a different direction after 12 years with Mr. Bloomberg, an exit poll found. \n \n In the unexpectedly heated race for the unglamorous office of city comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, repelled a last-minute comeback attempt by Eliot Spitzer, who resigned as governor over his use of prostitutes. And in the Democratic primary for public advocate, Letitia James, a City Council member from Brooklyn, will face Senator Daniel L. Squadron of Brooklyn in a runoff election. \n \n Photo \n \n In the race for mayor, Mr. de Blasio had until a few months ago been a distant fourth in a crowded Democratic field, well behind Christine C. Quinn, the longtime front-runner, who rose to prominence as the speaker of the City Council and a close ally of Mr. Bloomberg. Mr. de Blasio, propelled by an unrelenting critique of the mayor, frustrated Ms. Quinn\u2019s painstakingly cultivated effort to become the first woman and the first openly gay person to lead the city. \n \n Mr. Thompson, who nearly unseated Mr. Bloomberg in 2009, struggled this time to win over nonwhite voters who were crucial to his campaign strategy as the only black candidate in the race. \n \n Mr. de Blasio, a white Brooklynite who frequently showcased his biracial family, built a broad coalition of support among nearly every category of Democratic primary voters on Tuesday, according to the exit poll by Edison Research. His critique of a city divided between rich and poor \u2014 tried in the past by other candidates in New York and nationally with little success \u2014 resonated. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n \u201cI love his message about the tale of two cities, the big inequality gap,\u201d said Jelani Wheeler, 19, a politics student at St. John\u2019s University in Queens. \n \n \u201cWe can start correcting many important issues the city is facing, issues often ignored by the Bloomberg administration,\u201d he added. \n \n Though Democrats outnumber Republicans in New York by six to one, the city has not elected a Democratic mayor since David N. Dinkins in 1989. But the white voters who helped elect Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Bloomberg are a less potent political force in a city where ethnic and racial minorities now make up a majority of the population. \n \n Mr. de Blasio, who worked for Mr. Dinkins, this year inspired Democrats angry about how the economy and police practices affected them personally, as well as those who felt uncomfortable on their behalf. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

His critique of the police went further than that of either Ms. Quinn or Mr. Thompson \u2014 and he memorably deployed his teenage son, Dante, to make his case in a compelling television advertisement. \n \n Addressing widespread concerns about the gap between the city\u2019s rich and poor, Mr. de Blasio also proposed a tax on the wealthy to pay for universal prekindergarten \u2014 though his rhetoric made it sometimes seem unclear which was the end and which the means. \n \n His tax-the-rich proposal was dismissed by his rivals, who said it would never be approved in Albany. But at times Ms. Quinn and Mr. Thompson were left in the unwelcome position of sounding like proponents of the status quo, at a moment when voters made clear they were impatient to be led in a different direction. \n \n Photo \n \n Mr. de Blasio gained support from black voters like Jennifer Ward, 59, of Brownsville, Brooklyn, who on Tuesday helped her 85-year-old mother, in a flowing white dress with black polka-dots, up the steps of the Brownsville Beacon Community Center and into the big gymnasium. \n \n \u201cHe\u2019s strong and he fights,\u201d said Ms. Ward, a nurse, who was impressed by Mr. de Blasio\u2019s efforts to prevent the closing of local hospitals. \u201cEven if he has to stand alone, he fights for us.\u201d \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The Democrats had been jockeying for position ever since Mr. Bloomberg squeezed out a narrower-than-expected victory over Mr. Thompson four years ago. \n \n The presumptive favorite a year ago was Ms. Quinn, given her close ties to Mr. Bloomberg and the business community; in the spring, the race shifted with the entry of Anthony D. Weiner, a former congressman, who briefly led the field before sinking over revelations that he had continued sending sexually explicit online messages even after resigning. \n \n Ms. Quinn\u2019s defeat was crushing for a politician whose career as speaker was built on a belief that helping Mr. Bloomberg carry out his agenda would give her a record of accomplishments to run on. Her crucial role in making Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s third term possible antagonized a huge swath of Democratic voters who showed they were unwilling to forgive and forget. \n \n Mr. Thompson relied on a campaign strategy built on old-fashioned New York City identity politics and electoral arithmetic. He worked hard to enlist support from establishment political players, while obtaining important municipal union endorsements. \n \n The police, the firefighters, the transit workers and, most important, the teachers all lined up behind Mr. Thompson; the teachers\u2019 union alone spent about $2.6 million on his behalf. \n \n Pointing to his record as a behind-the-scenes power broker as school board president and as a fiscal steward while city comptroller, Mr. Thompson positioned himself as the adult in the Democratic field, running well to the right of Mr. de Blasio \u2014 and even campaigning with former Senator Alfonse M. D\u2019Amato, once the state Republican kingpin. \n \n In the event of a runoff, Mr. de Blasio would begin with an fund-raising advantage of about $400,000 over Mr. Thompson. Each would be able to spend a maximum of $3.123 million, under a spending limit imposed by the city\u2019s campaign finance program. \n \n But on Tuesday night, Mr. de Blasio was celebrating. As guests ate schnitzel with shallots and ginger served on soft pretzel heros, the crowd focused on the now-familiar sight of Dante\u2019s outsized Afro, which Mr. de Blasio\u2019s daughter, Chiara, affectionately caressed. A moment later, when Mr. de Blasio took the stage, he paid his own form of tribute to his son\u2019s hair, telling supporters that Dante had to fend off strangers trying to touch it. \n \n \u201cSecurity was ready to intervene,\u201d he said. ||||| Public Advocate Bill de Blasio, who ran an upstart campaign pledging to fight New York City's economic inequality, emerged as the surprising top choice in the Democratic mayoral primary, but could still face weeks _ and another electoral fight _ before becoming his party's nominee. \n \n Mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, right, kisses his wife Chirlane McCray after casting his primary vote on Tuesday, Sept. 10, 2013, at the Park Slope Public Library in Brooklyn, N.Y.

(Associated Press) \n \n The swirling, chaotic campaign to replace billionaire Mayor Michael Bloomberg, which featured former congressman Anthony Weiner's latest sexting scandal and at least three lead changes in the polls, was fittingly plunged into uncertainty again after the votes were tallied in Tuesday's primary. \n \n With 97 percent of precincts reporting, de Blasio had about 40.2 percent of the total vote, which puts him a whisker above the 40 percent threshold needed to avoid triggering an automatic Oct. 1 runoff. If he cannot maintain that, he will face former city Comptroller Bill Thompson, who has 26 percent, for a potentially grueling three-week, one-on-one showdown, with the winner advancing to face Republican nominee Joe Lhota, the former chairman of the Metropolitan Transit Authority, in the general election on Nov. 5. \n \n But it may take a week or more before it is known whether that battle will be fought at all. \n \n The campaign will take a pause Wednesday as the city stops to observe the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Later this week, election officials will recount all the ballots cast Tuesday. It will likely take until early next week before they tabulate an additional 30,000 or more votes as absentee ballots arrive by mail and paperwork comes in from voters who had problems at the polls. \n \n City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, the early front-runner who was seeking to become the city's first woman and openly gay mayor, finished third at 16 percent, followed by current city Comptroller John Liu at 7 percent and Weiner at 5 percent. \n \n De Blasio, who was flanked by the interracial family he made a centerpiece of his campaign ads, made no mention of the potential runoff in his speech to supporters late Tuesday. \n \n \"We are better as a city when we make sure that everyone has a shot,\" de Blasio told the raucous crowd. \"We begin tonight.\" \n \n The winner of the mayor's race in November will assume the helm of the nation's largest city which has been led for 12 years by Bloomberg. The election comes at a critical juncture as the city experiences shrinking crime rates yet widening income inequality, and as the nearly completed One World Trade Center building symbolizes a new era after the terrorist attacks of 2001. \n \n With de Blasio so close to 40 percent, Democratic leaders may pressure Thompson to drop out of the race in the name of party unity. Exit polling shows that de Blasio would handily defeat Thompson in a runoff, 52 to 34 percent, with 9 percent saying they would stay home. \n \n But Thompson made it clear Tuesday he would compete in a potential runoff. \n \n \"Three more weeks! Three more weeks!\" chanted Thompson, the party's 2009 nominee. \"This is far from over.\" \n \n De Blasio's rise in the race to succeed Bloomberg was as sudden as it was unexpected. \n \n Not even two months ago, he was an afterthought in the campaign but surged in part thanks to an ad blitz that centered on his interracial family, his headline-grabbing arrest while protesting the possible closure of a Brooklyn hospital and the defection of Weiner's former supporters in the wake of another sexting scandal. \n \n Weiner was leading in the polls until a gossip website revealed that he used the online handle Carlos Danger to continue to send X-rated messages to women even after he resigned from the House of Representatives in 2011 for similar behavior. \n \n The exit polling showed the appeal of de Blasio, the city's elected public advocate, to be broad-based: He was ahead in all five boroughs; was ahead of Quinn, the lone woman in the race, with female voters; and ahead of Thompson, the only African-American candidate, with black voters. The voter interviews were conducted by Edison Media Research for The Associated Press and other news organizations. \n \n Lhota, the ex-transit authority chairman and former deputy mayor to Rudolph Giuliani, defeated billionaire grocery magnate John Catsimatidis for the Republican nomination. Both Republican candidates largely pledged to follow Bloomberg's lead, focusing on maintaining the city's record low crime rates. \n \n Another scandal-scarred politician, Eliot Spitzer, who resigned as New York's governor in 2008 after paying for sex with prostitutes, tried to run a self-financed campaign for the lesser office of city comptroller. But his distant, television-heavy campaign struggled to connect with voters and he lost to Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer by a margin of 52 percent to 48 percent. \n \n Bloomberg, the businessman Republican-turned-independent, is completing his third term. While the city's registered Democrats outnumber Republicans 6 to 1, the Republican Party's recent success in mayoral elections has been largely attributed to a crime epidemic, the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks or other extraordinary circumstances. \n \n Nearly three-quarters of Democratic primary voters said the next mayor ought to move away from Bloomberg policies, according to the exit polls. \n \n De Blasio, 52, has fashioned himself as the cleanest break from the Bloomberg years, proposing to raise taxes on the wealthy to fund universal pre-kindergarten and change city police practices he says discriminate against minorities. \n \n De Blasio, who worked in Bill Clinton's White House and Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign before being elected to the city council and then public advocate, became the front-runner in the race's final weeks. \n \n Quinn was the front-runner for much of the year, boasting the biggest campaign war chest and strong establishment backing. But she was dogged by her support to change term limits to let Bloomberg run again in 2009, a decision unpopular with liberals who make up the bulk of Democratic primary voters.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 As expected, Bill de Blasio will easily finish first in New York City's Democratic primary for mayor, reports the AP. What's unclear is whether he will get the necessary 40% to avoid a runoff with the second-place finisher. With 97% of returns in, de Blasio had 40.02%, Bill Thompson 26%, and Christine Quinn 15%. Trailing those three were city comptroller John Liu (7%) and, yes, Anthony Weiner (5%). The eventual Democratic winner will face former MTA chief (and Rudy Giuliani deputy) Joe Lhota in the general election in November. He won the GOP race over billionaire John Catsimatidis. There will be a recount of yesterday's ballots, and some 30,000 votes, including absentee ballots, still need to be counted a first time. A final result may not be known for 10 days and Thompson has made it clear that he won't drop out in the name of party unity: He chanted \"Three more weeks!\" at his election night event, referring to a time before a potential runoff, which polls show he would lose. Exit polls showed that de Blasio, the city's public advocate, did well with a wide swath of voters from different ethnic groups and locales, reports the New York Times. More so than the other candidates, he advocated a clean break from Michael Bloomberg, making a particular issue of Bloomberg's stop-and-frisk policy. The mayor interjected himself into the campaign when he accused de Blasio of running a \"racist\" campaign\u2014in part because the candidate featured his Afro-sporting teen son in a TV ad.

    "document": "Since the late 1970s, China has moved from a closed, centrally planned system to a more market-oriented one that plays a major global role. China has implemented reforms in a gradualist fashion, resulting in efficiency gains that have contributed to a more than tenfold increase in GDP since 1978. Reforms began with the phaseout of collectivized agriculture, and expanded to include the gradual liberalization of prices, fiscal decentralization, increased autonomy for state enterprises, growth of the private sector, development of stock markets and a modern banking system, and opening to foreign trade and investment. China continues to pursue an industrial policy, state support of key sectors, and a restrictive investment regime. From 2013 to 2017, China had one of the fastest growing economies in the world, averaging slightly more than 7% real growth per year. Measured on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis that adjusts for price differences, China in 2017 stood as the largest economy in the world, surpassing the US in 2014 for the first time in modern history. China became the world's largest exporter in 2010, and the largest trading nation in 2013. Still, China's per capita income is below the world average. \n \n In July 2005 moved to an exchange rate system that references a basket of currencies. From mid-2005 to late 2008, the renminbi (RMB) appreciated more than 20% against the US dollar, but the exchange rate remained virtually pegged to the dollar from the onset of the global financial crisis until June 2010, when Beijing announced it would resume a gradual appreciation. From 2013 until early 2015, the renminbi held steady against the dollar, but it depreciated 13% from mid-2015 until end-2016 amid strong capital outflows; in 2017 the RMB resumed appreciating against the dollar \u2013 roughly 7% from end-of-2016 to end-of-2017. In 2015, the People\u2019s Bank of China announced it would continue to carefully push for full convertibility of the renminbi, after the currency was accepted as part of the IMF\u2019s special drawing rights basket. However, since late 2015 the Chinese Government has strengthened capital controls and oversight of overseas investments to better manage the exchange rate and maintain financial stability. \n \n The Chinese Government faces numerous economic challenges including: (a) reducing its high domestic savings rate and correspondingly low domestic household consumption; (b) managing its high corporate debt burden to maintain financial stability; (c) controlling off-balance sheet local government debt used to finance infrastructure stimulus; (d) facilitating higher-wage job opportunities for the aspiring middle class, including rural migrants and college graduates, while maintaining competitiveness; (e) dampening speculative investment in the real estate sector without sharply slowing the economy; (f) reducing industrial overcapacity; and (g) raising productivity growth rates through the more efficient allocation of capital and state-support for innovation. Economic development has progressed further in coastal provinces than in the interior, and by 2016 more than 169.3 million migrant workers and their dependents had relocated to urban areas to find work. One consequence of China\u2019s population control policy known as the \"one-child policy\" - which was relaxed in 2016 to permit all families to have two children - is that China is now one of the most rapidly aging countries in the world. Deterioration in the environment - notably air pollution, soil erosion, and the steady fall of the water table, especially in the North - is another long-term problem. China continues to lose arable land because of erosion and urbanization. The Chinese Government is seeking to add energy production capacity from sources other than coal and oil, focusing on natural gas, nuclear, and clean energy development. In 2016, China ratified the Paris Agreement, a multilateral agreement to combat climate change, and committed to peak its carbon dioxide emissions between 2025 and 2030. \n \n The government's 13th Five-Year Plan, unveiled in March 2016, emphasizes the need to increase innovation and boost domestic consumption to make the economy less dependent on government investment, exports, and heavy industry. However, China has made more progress on subsidizing innovation than rebalancing the economy. Beijing has committed to giving the market a more decisive role in allocating resources, but the Chinese Government\u2019s policies continue to favor state-owned enterprises and emphasize stability. Chinese leaders in 2010 pledged to double China\u2019s GDP by 2020, and the 13th Five Year Plan includes annual economic growth targets of at least 6.5% through 2020 to achieve that goal. In recent years, China has renewed its support for state-owned enterprises in sectors considered important to \"economic security,\" explicitly looking to foster globally competitive industries. Chinese leaders also have undermined some market-oriented reforms by reaffirming the \"dominant\" role of the state in the economy, a stance that threatens to discourage private initiative and make the economy less efficient over time. The slight acceleration in economic growth in 2017\u2014the first such uptick since 2010\u2014gives Beijing more latitude to pursue its economic reforms, focusing on financial sector deleveraging and its Supply-Side Structural Reform agenda, first announced in late 2015. ||||| China plans to increase defense spending 11.2 percent this year as the country\u2019s expanding global commitments and lingering territorial disputes drive demand for more warships, missiles and fighter planes. \n \n Military spending is set to rise this year to about 670 billion yuan ($106.4 billion), Li Zhaoxing, spokesman for China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress, said yesterday ahead of a speech today by Premier Wen Jiabao to open the annual 10-day session of the country\u2019s legislature. \n \n China\u2019s defense spending, the second highest in the world after the U.S., has risen in tandem with the expansion of its economy and a new focus by the Obama administration on the Asia- Pacific region. China is also involved in spats with Vietnam, the Philippines and Japan over control of oil- and gas-rich waters and has a lingering territorial dispute with India that erupted into a war in 1962. \n \n \u201cChina\u2019s got a lot of things that require a state to have military hardware for,\u201d Geoff Raby, who was Australia\u2019s ambassador to China until last year, said in a telephone interview. \u201cChina lives in a neighborhood where it doesn\u2019t have any natural allies or friends.\u201d \n \n Satellite Maker Rises \n \n China North Optical-Electrical Technology Co. (600435), the maker of military control systems and sensors, rose as much as 9.7 percent in Shanghai trading, the biggest intraday gain in more than a month. The Beijing-based company was up 6.3 percent at 10.31 yuan as of 10:14 a.m. China Dongfanghong Spacesat Co. (600118), which builds satellites, advanced as much as 3.9 percent. \n \n Defense spending has more than doubled since 2006, tracking a rise in nominal gross domestic product from 20.9 trillion yuan to 47.2 trillion yuan in that time. China\u2019s spending on domestic security will be higher than military spending this year for the third straight year, according to Finance Ministry figures released today, underscoring the government\u2019s concerns about growing social unrest and threats to stability in Tibet and Xinjiang province. \n \n The growing defense budget has stoked concerns among China\u2019s neighbors and the U.S., which announced last year a strategic shift toward Asia including deploying forces to a base in Australia. Chinese defense spending as a percentage of GDP was about 1.3 percent in 2011, falling from about 1.4 percent in 2006. \n \n \u2018Reasonable and Appropriate\u2019 \n \n \u201cThe Chinese government has maintained reasonable and appropriate growth of defense spending on the strength of rapid economic and social development and the steady increase of fiscal revenues,\u201d Li said. \n \n He spoke a day before the start of the annual meeting of the National People\u2019s Congress, the 3,000-member parliament that is legally the highest governmental body in China. Sessions run from today to March 14. \n \n U.S. analysts say actual Chinese defense spending is much higher than the amount announced by Li yesterday. Phillip Saunders, director of the Center for the Study of Chinese Military Affairs at National Defense University in Washington, estimates China\u2019s true defense spending is 50 percent higher than the official budget because items such as research and development as well as foreign weapons procurement are not included. Li said research and procurement are included. \n \n Off-Budget Items \n \n Taylor Fravel, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies China\u2019s relations with its neighbors, said the number of off-budget items such has foreign arms procurement have decreased in recent years. China includes support for veterans in its budget while the U.S. does not, Fravel said. \n \n While Chinese military spending is still officially less than a fifth of U.S. defense spending, its neighbors are concerned about the country\u2019s expansive territorial claims. China claims indisputable sovereignty over the islands, reefs and shoals of the South China Sea and their surrounding waters, demarcating a tongue-shaped claim on Chinese maps extending hundreds of miles from mainland China. \n \n China is \u201calways ready\u201d to use force if necessary to ensure its territorial integrity in the South China Sea, Maj. Gen. Luo Yan, deputy secretary general of the Chinese Academy of Military Science, said today. China\u2019s military should be \u201cstrong and big,\u201d and the country should do more to mark its rightful claim to the area, he told reporters in Beijing. \n \n \u2018Scared Its Neighbors\u2019 \n \n It also contests control over the Senkaku, or Diaoyu islands with Japan, which sparked a diplomatic standoff in 2010 after Japan detained a Chinese fishing boat captain when his vessel collided with a Japanese patrol boat. Japan is \u201cclosely watching\u201d China\u2019s military spending and is seeking greater transparency in its outlays, Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura told reporters today in Tokyo. \n \n Vietnam recently filed a protest saying China assaulted its fishermen and prevented them from entering the Paracel Islands. China responded by claiming sovereignty over the islands and said it didn\u2019t board the vessels. \n \n \u201cChina scared its neighbors,\u201d Saunders said in an e-mail. \u201cNow it is back on the path of greater restraint, but its neighbors are still alarmed.\u201d \n \n U.S. concerns stem from Chinese progress in developing modern fighters and precision ballistic missiles that can target U.S. aircraft carriers, Saunders said. \n \n In the past year, China began sea trials of its first aircraft carrier, a refurbished Soviet-era vessel acquired from Ukraine more than a decade ago. \n \n Military Buildup \n \n Beijing is also continuing a military buildup across the Taiwan Strait. The U.S. is obligated by a 1979 law to provide defensive weapons to Taiwan, which China claims as a province. A Pentagon report published last August said that as of December, 2010, China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army had deployed between 1,000 and 1,200 short-range ballistic missiles to units opposite Taiwan even as cross-Strait ties have improved. \n \n Last year the U.S. announced it would sell Taiwan $5.3 billion in upgrades for its 145 Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) F-16 fighters. \n \n China will boost spending on domestic security by 11.5 percent this year to 701.8 billion yuan, outstripping spending on defense by 31.5 billion yuan, according to a table in the work report issued by the Finance Ministry. \n \n Economic Interests \n \n Economic interests around the world, including 812,000 workers abroad at the end of 2011, mean China\u2019s military may increasingly deploy across the globe. China set a frigate to Libya last year to help evacuate thousands of Chinese nationals during the revolt that saw the overthrow of Muammar Qaddafi. Li said Chinese warships have made eight deployments to help international efforts to protect sea lanes from Somali pirates. Chinese peacekeepers now patrol as part of a United Nations mission in Sudan. \n \n The country is also increasingly dependent on global commerce for its well-being, factors which in past eras led countries such as the U.K. and the U.S. to boost military spending. Combined imports and exports last year amounted to $3.6 trillion, and China, the world\u2019s biggest energy consumer, is also the world\u2019s second-biggest oil importer after the U.S. \n \n The U.S., with an economy less than three times the size of China\u2019s, has a military budget about between five and six times as big. The Pentagon is asking for $613.9 billion next year, which also includes $88.5 billion in supplemental spending for wars. Unlike China\u2019s, the U.S. defense budget is shrinking. The Pentagon\u2019s request is $31.8 billion less than the amount enacted by Congress for 2012. \n \n China\u2019s defense spending increased an average of 16.2 percent a year from 1999 to 2008, according to figures from a defense white paper published in 2009. While building up spending, China has also proclaimed that it takes a nonconfrontational approach in the region. \n \n \u201cChina\u2019s limited military strength is aimed at safeguarding sovereignty, national security and territorial integrity,\u201d Li said. \u201cIt will not in the least pose a threat to other countries.\u201d \n \n To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Michael Forsythe in Beijing at mforsythe@bloomberg.net; Yidi Zhao in Beijing at yzhao7@bloomberg.net \n \n To contact the editor responsible for this story: Peter Hirschberg at phirschberg@bloomberg.net",

Yvette Clarke, D-N,Y, walks down the steps during their arrival on Air Force One, Wednesday, April 8, 2015 at Norman Manley International Airport... (Associated Press) \n \n U.S. President Barack Obama waves during his arrival on Air Force One, Wednesday, April 8, 2015 at Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston, Jamaica. Obama arrived to Jamaica for a two day visit... (Associated Press) \n \n Obama's arrival Wednesday evening in Kingston, Jamaica, was low-key compared to the excitement he stirred in the Caribbean upon his election in 2008. Greeted at the airport tarmac by dignitaries including Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller, Obama slipped into a motorcade that ran through mostly quiet, empty streets. \n \n The visit comes amid a perception that Obama's interest in the region has failed to materialize. Yet his travels \u2014 first to Jamaica, then to the Summit of the Americas in Panama \u2014 follow a year of increased attention to the region by the U.S. president. His immigration executive orders, his efforts to slow the influx of Central American minors to the U.S. border, and his diplomatic outreach to Cuba have put a foreign policy spotlight on U.S. neighbors to the south. \n \n Obama on Thursday will meet with Simpson Miller and with other leaders in the 15-member Caribbean Community. He also plans to speak to young regional leaders in a town-hall setting, continuing a tradition of engaging new generations in foreign political and civil society institutions. \n \n The president promptly paid tribute to the island's cultural hero, the late reggae star Bob Marley, making an unscheduled visit Wednesday night to the legendary singer's museum. He toured Marley's former home as Marley's hit \"One Love\" played through the building's sound system. \n \n In the Caribbean, energy security tops Obama's agenda as the U.S. seeks to fill a potential void left by Venezuela's scaled-back oil diplomacy. Earlier this year, Vice President Joe Biden hosted prime ministers and other top officials from all Caribbean countries except Cuba at the first Caribbean Energy Security Summit in Washington. \n \n \"We, in looking at the region, saw that a number of the (Caribbean) countries had significant energy needs,\" said Benjamin Rhodes, a White House deputy national security adviser. \"At the same time, the United States has significant resources, not just in terms of our own energy production, but also in our energy infrastructure, in our ability to work with countries that have formed cooperative solutions to promote energy security.\" \n \n Meanwhile, China has steadily expanded its economic alliances in the Caribbean, providing much of the financing for new roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects. \n \n \"China is running away with the gold in the view of many region watchers. Its footprint is visible and obvious through its 'checkbook' diplomacy in the Caribbean,\" said Anthony Bryan, an international relations professor at Trinidad's campus of the University of the West Indies. The public university system serves 18 English-speaking countries and territories. \n \n Obama's visit to Jamaica is the first by a U.S. president since President Ronald Reagan in 1982. Obama was last in the Caribbean region in 2009 when he attended the Summit of the Americas in Trinidad. His stop in Kingston comes ahead of his attendance at this year's summit of the Western Hemisphere's heads of government Friday and Saturday in Panama. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow McFadden on Twitter: http://twitter.com/dmcfadd and Kuhnhenn on http://twitter.com/jkuhnhenn ||||| Image copyright Reuters Image caption The Bob Marley museum in central Kingston was Barack Obama's first stop after landing in Jamaica \n \n Barack Obama has taken a tour of the Bob Marley museum in Jamaica after becoming the first US president to visit the country since 1982. \n \n To the strains of the late reggae star's One Love, Mr Obama was shown around the sprawling house in Kingston that was Mr Marley's final home. \n \n The US president said he was a fan of the musician, telling his museum guide: \"I still have all the albums.\" \n \n Mr Obama is in Jamaica to meet the 15-member Caribbean Community bloc. \n \n But his first stop after landing in Kingston was the old Victorian-style house in central Kingston that Mr Marley called home between 1975 and his death in 1981. \n \n Mr Obama spent 20 minutes in the museum, which now houses artefacts from the singer's life including gold records and his Grammy Lifetime Achievement award. \n \n His arrival aboard Air Force One on Wednesday made him the first sitting US president to set foot in the country since Ronald Reagan visited 33 years ago. \n \n He was greeted by Jamaican Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller and the US Ambassador to Jamaica, Luis Moreno. \n \n Mr Obama will meet representatives of the 15 countries in the Caribbean Community group on the three-day trip to Jamaica and Panama, and is expected to discuss energy and security issues.",

(Photo: KREM-TV, Spokane) \n \n An 89-year-old store owner in Washington state used a golf club to beat off a suspected robber who wielded a sword, prompting the suspect to drop the stolen cash register as he made away on a bicycle, according to police and published reports. \n \n Police in the 21,000-population city of Moses Lake say owner Miyo Koba was inside Frank's Superette on Sunday morning when a tall, slender male wearing a ski mask and dark glasses swooped in. Koba has owned the store in this community between Seattle and Spokane for 60 years, and kept it up even after her husband died, police said. Her store is popular among local high school students and is a block and a half from the school, police said. \n \n When Koba found the suspect standing behind the cash register Sunday, she set about a campaign of aggression. Police describe Koba as a small woman who weighs no more than 125 pounds. \n \n \"I had the scissors in my hand like this, and he was trying to open the till, and he said, 'Open the till!'\" Koba said, giving KREM-TV/Spokane, blow-by-blow details. \"I said, 'No, I'm not going to open the till for you,' and I said, 'If you don't get your hands off the till, I'm going to stab you with my scissors.'\" \n \n Koba admitted she didn't have the nerve to stab the suspect, but her tactics apparently had an effect. The suspect became unnerved when Koba would not open the register, Koba told KREM. \n \n \"He started pounding on the register trying to open it,\" Koba said. \n \n \"He pulled out his little sword out of his little jacket, and he just kind of waved it a little bit,\" she told KREM. Police said the \"little\" sword was 3-feet-long. \n \n The suspect pushed Koba, and she fell, spotting the golf club, she said. \n \n \"I \u2026 tried to swing this club at him, and I tried to hit his head a couple of times, but I couldn't reach it,\" Koba told the news organization. \n \n No matter. She went for his legs, swinging and hitting them. \n \n The man escaped on a bicycle, cash register and sword in hand, according to KREM, but police said Koba later recovered the register nearby with the money still in it. \n \n The man apparently stripped after he left the store because police later found his clothing, according to KREM. \n \n Police said they are continuing the investigation. \n \n Koba said the would-be robber with the \"little\" sword never fazed her. \n \n \"I didn't feel threatened,\" she told KREM. \"It just probably made me a little more brave.\" \n \n Read or Share this story: http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/05/27/golf-club-store-sword/9652891/",

    "document": "DAVENPORT, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush on Thursday declined to rule out resuming the use of torture under some circumstances by the U.S. government. \n \n Republican presidential candidate, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, speaks during a forum sponsored by Americans for Peace, Prosperity and Security, Thursday, Aug. 13, 2015, at St. Ambrose University in... (Associated Press) \n \n \"I don't want to make a definitive, blanket kind of statement,\" Bush told an audience of Iowa Republicans, when asked whether he would keep in place or repeal President Barack Obama's executive order banning so-called enhanced interrogation techniques by the CIA. \n \n \"When you are president your words matter,\" he said. \n \n The former Florida governor said that in general, he believes torture is inappropriate, and that he was glad his brother, former President George W. Bush, largely ended the CIA's use of the techniques before he left office. The CIA used waterboarding, slapping, nudity, sleep deprivation, humiliation and other methods to coerce al-Qaida detainees \u2014 methods the military would be prohibited from using on prisoners of war. \n \n A Senate report released last year cited CIA records in concluding that the techniques were more brutal than previously disclosed, that the CIA lied about them, and that they failed to produce unique, life-saving intelligence. The CIA and its defenders take issue with the report. \n \n Jeb Bush said he believed that the techniques were effective in producing intelligence, but that \"now we're in a different environment.\" \n \n He suggested there may be occasions when brutal interrogations were called for to keep the country safe. \n \n \"That's why I'm not saying in every condition, under every possible scenario,\" Bush said. \n \n Later Thursday in Iowa, Bush said there is a difference between enhanced interrogation techniques and torture, but declined to be specific. \"I don't know. I'm just saying if I'm going to be president of the United States, you take this threat seriously.\" \n \n Bush has been walking a careful path, seeking to disassociate himself from some of the unpopular aspects of his brother's legacy while praising him. \n \n In discussing the Iraq war, for example, Bush, who previously acknowledged that the intelligence didn't support the decision to invade, on Thursday said he had learned from some of the mistakes made during the occupation, including what he said was a wrong decision to disband the Iraqi military. He said his brother also now believes that was a mistake. \n \n Bush blames the rise of the Islamic State group on what he said was Obama's failure to negotiate an agreement to leave U.S. troops there in 2011. Asked if it was true that there would be no IS absent a U.S. invasion of Iraq, he said there was no way to know. \n \n He repeated his call for a more aggressive posture toward the Islamic State group but, like the Obama administration, he opposes sending in regular U.S. ground forces. He does favor putting special operations troops on the battlefield. \n \n Bush spoke at a foreign policy forum sponsored by Americans for Peace, Prosperity and Security, a group chaired by Mike Rogers, a former Republican congressman from Michigan who chaired the House Intelligence Committee. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writer Catherine Lucey contributed to this report from Ankeny, Iowa. ||||| AP Photo Jeb Bush defends George W.\u2019s Iraq War legacy The former Florida governor stops running away from his Iraq War problem. \n \n DAVENPORT, Iowa \u2014 Jeb Bush is owning his Iraq War problem. \n \n Bush, wrestling with his brother\u2019s legacy of the war for the second time in three days, again sought to cast blame on the Obama administration for its failure to achieve a \u201cfragile but secure\u201d peace in the region that has been overrun by ISIS militants. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n As he did in his speech Tuesday night outlining his own approach to combating ISIS in Iraq and Syria, the former Florida governor and presidential hopeful glossed over his brother\u2019s decision to go to war in Iraq \u2014 and while acknowledging that mistakes were made, he seemed to view the war itself in positive terms. \n \n \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, taking out Saddam Hussein turned out to be a pretty good deal,\u201d the former Florida governor told a crowd of roughly 200 people who attended a forum on national security at St. Ambrose College. \n \n Bush\u2019s efforts to present himself as a strong, sensible commander in chief are complicated by the unpopular war his brother waged in Iraq \u2014 a war the likely Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, supported at the time \u2014 and by his own tendency to view it in a more favorable light. \n \n While Democrats are sure to mine Bush\u2019s words for attack ad soundbites, the candidate showed no signs of tempering his praise for his brother\u2019s war record. \n \n To the contrary, after months of difficulty reconciling the broadly held public view that the Iraq War was a mistake with his own hawkish foreign policy views and an innate unwillingness to rehash and criticize his brother\u2019s record, he has settled on a strategy: unapologetically arguing that the war, however misconceived, brought about an opportunity for a more stable Middle East, one that the current Democratic administration squandered. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m not saying this because I\u2019m a Bush,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m proud of what he did to create a secure environment for our country.\u201d \n \n With 17 of his 21 foreign policy advisers being veterans of George W. Bush\u2019s White House, Bush\u2019s position is no great surprise. And in a wild Republican primary to be decided by a conservative electorate clamoring for a more muscular approach to foreign policy, it might be a smart strategic play. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s not like you can run a campaign for president and not talk about Iraq,\u201d said Tim Miller, Bush\u2019s campaign spokesman. \u201cWe can talk about Iraq on our terms. Terrorism and radical Islam is something the country cares about and certainly Republican primary voters are very concerned about it. He wanted to take the mantle as somebody who\u2019s going to have a strategy and be a leader on it. There\u2019s a primary electorate on our side that\u2019s looking for that.\u201d \n \n Specifically, Bush focused again on the 2007 troop surge as a \u201ccourageous\u201d decision that, he argues, temporarily curtailed sectarian violence within in Iraq; and he blames President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Clinton for removing American troops too hastily and creating the power vacuum that\u2019s allowed ISIS to take root. \n \n \u201cWe just washed our hands of the effort,\u201d Bush said. \u201cWe declared success and then chaos occurred afterwards.\u201d \n \n More than anything else Bush said Thursday afternoon here, that statement underlined the political perils of this candidate talking about that war. The words he chose to criticize Obama for bringing U.S. forces home from Iraq too soon evoked decade-old critiques of his brother\u2019s infamous declaration of \u2018Mission Accomplished\u2019 in Iraq in a show of bravado aboard the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln in May 2003. \n \n Some Bush donors privately question the strategy of Bush focusing attention on foreign policy and, specifically, the Iraq War with his speech Tuesday night in Los Angeles and the forum on national security here Thursday. Even though Tuesday\u2019s speech didn\u2019t begin until after 9 p.m. Eastern time, it garnered significant media attention. \n \n \u201cIf you\u2019re of the view that the U.S. should do nothing about ISIS, Jeb\u2019s not going to be your candidate,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAnd that might be the majority view of the media, so that\u2019s something we have to contend with; but that\u2019s not the view of the American people.\u201d \n \n The subject of the Iraq War was the first major thing to trip Bush up earlier this year and, whatever the campaign\u2019s attempts to deal with it head on now, will likely be something he wrestles with for the duration of his campaign. \n \n Back in May, Bush stumbled during an interview with Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly when he didn\u2019t clearly answer whether he believes the war, in hindsight, was a mistake (after four days of controversy, he acknowledged it was, in hindsight, a mistake). \n \n \u201cThe decision to dismantle the Iraqi army was a mistake, and I think my brother would admit that today,\u201d he said Thursday, as he pushed back at questions suggesting that he was attempting to rewrite history by suggesting that ISIS \u201cdidn\u2019t exist\u201d when his brother was president and that Obama bears the blame for carrying out the Strategic Forces Agreement his brother negotiated to bring U.S. troops home from Iraq. \n \n \u201cI reject this out of hand, this whole idea that somehow, after the surge, they\u2019re just doing it because the agreement required them to do it,\u201d Bush said. \u201cLeadership requires a strategy.\u201d \n \n Asked whether Clinton, then Obama\u2019s secretary of state, deserved credit for pushing within the administration to maintain a larger troop presence in Iraq, Bush hedged: \u201cShe was not very effective in her advocacy,\u201d he said. \n \n Bush bristled at the moderator\u2019s suggestion that his own strategy to take on ISIS isn\u2019t that different from Obama, but he defended the administration\u2019s use of drones and said that he would keep detainees imprisoned at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, just as Obama, despite promises to close the prison, has done. \n \n \u201cThis is not a torture chamber,\u201d Bush said. \u201cThere is no other option that I can see.\u201d \n \n In reiterating his own plan to root out ISIS, Bush called for engaging U.S. allies and working to strengthen a coalition of moderates in Syria, but his critique of Obama again brought to mind those leveled against his brother\u2019s war. \n \n \u201cWe can\u2019t unilaterally go into countries,\u201d he said. \n \n Follow @politico",

Andrew Holness; Leader of the Opposition, the Most. Hon.

The law will allow for criminal proceedings to be brought against corrupt public officials and parliamentarians. \n \n \n \n \n \n Among the other pieces of legislation are: the Bill to amend the INDECOM Act; a bill to amend the Constitution to address the judicial review of the director of public prosecutions; and the Criminal Justice Amendment Bill to provide for reduced sentences on guilty pleas. \n \n \n \n \n \n Additionally, the Governor General said the Government has proposed that the Dangerous Drugs Act is to be further amended to \"give full legislation\" for marijuana to be used for specified purposes. \n \n \n \n \n \n Lawmakers are also expected to carry through other pieces of legislation that are already in train. These include the Integrity Commission Bill; the Arbitration Bill; and the Judicature (Resident Magistrate) (Amendment) Bill; the Law Reform (Notice of Alibi) Bill, which stalled in the House years ago when members of parliament protested the provisions; and the Mutual Assistance (Criminal Matters) (Amendment) Bill to allow for the introduction of evidence by closed circuit television link and video-recorded evidence.

However, even though his 500-page paper was published in 2012, no one has managed to understand it. Mochizuki says his fellow mathematicians are failing to get to grips with his work. \n \n The ABC conjecture is deceptively complicated. It roughly states that three numbers a, b and c, which have no common factor and satisfy a + b = c cannot be too smooth (more detailed explanation here). In number theory, a smooth number is an integer which factors completely into small prime numbers. \n \n The beauty of this theory is that it captures the intuitive sense that triples of numbers which satisfy a linear relation, and which are divisible by high perfect powers, are rare. It seems like a bottomless, still lake \u2013 it seems very simple, but the more you dive into it, the deeper it gets. In fact, the theory poses some significant questions about the actual nature of numbers, so truly understanding it would be highly significant for mathematics. \n \n Step in, Mochizuki. In 2012, he published a 500-page paper online that claimed to solve the puzzle. There were two problems however \u2013 the first one, that it\u2019s a 500 page paper, and the second (and more important one), that it uses a dense framework of new maths created by him and dubbed \u201cInter-universal Teichm\u00fcller Theory\u201d \u2013 a framework that has even experience mathematicians struggling. Inter-universal Teichm\u00fcller Theory is basically a whole new way of looking at numbers which he used to prove other conjectures, such as the Szpiro conjecture, and part of the Vojta\u2019s conjecture for the case of hyperbolic curves, as well as Fermat\u2019s Last Theory. \n \n Mochizuki is a highly-respected mathematician and his work is taken seriously \u2013 it\u2019s not like no one has tried to understand his work. It\u2019s just that \u2026 no one could. Now, he has released a report in which he says that mathematicians working with him studying his theory have yet to find a flaw, but he criticized the community, saying that most researchers are \u201csimply not qualified\u201d to issue a definitive statement on the proof because they don\u2019t truly understand his theory \u2013 and haven\u2019t tried hard enough. Minhyong Kim of the University of Oxford is one of the many who are still awaiting the verdict in this case. \n \n Advertisement \u201cIt\u2019s a bit disappointing that no one has come out and said it\u2019s right or wrong,\u201d he says. \n \n The thing is that if you want to understand the proof of this theory, you have to first understand the Inter-universal Teichm\u00fcller Theory he developed, and that\u2019s no easy feat in itself. \n \n \u201cI sympathise with his sense of frustration but I also sympathise with other people who don\u2019t understand why he\u2019s not doing things in a more standard way,\u201d says Kim. It isn\u2019t really sustainable for Mochizuki to teach people one-on-one, he adds, and any journal would probably require independent reviewers who have not studied under Mochizuki to verify the proof. \n \n I\u2019m not exactly sure exactly why Mochizuki chose to work in this complicated way, but hey, if it works, it works. I think the scientific community has a duty to rise up to the event and figure out if this is right or wrong. Sure it\u2019s complicated, but that\u2019s modern math \u2013 you\u2019d expect no less. I also believe we\u2019re not going to get any reply from Mochizuki, seeing as he wrote the following: \n \n \u201cThe papers were released in order to make it possible for specialists to study and assess the validity of IUTeich; they were never intended as an announcement to the general public. Moreover, I never envisaged that these papers might elicit reactions consisting of non-mathematical content from non-specialists. I have no intention of responding to such non-mathematical reactions.\u201d \n \n But until someone figures if Mochizuki is right or wrong, his theories remain in a Schrodinger\u2019s cat like state. \n \n \u201cThis sense of stubbornness, dignity and pride is a part of what gives him the personality necessary to embark on a project like this,\u201d says Kim. But for now, the proof remains in limbo. \u201cIt\u2019s a curious state.\u201d",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A Japanese mathematician swears he's solved one of the biggest problems in the world of math. The problem is, nobody, not even fellow mathematicians of the highest caliber, can understand Shinichi Mochizuki's proof of something called the ABC conjecture, reports New Scientist. It doesn't help that the proof itself is 500 pages long or that Mochizuki developed his own set of mathematical principles called the Inter-Universal Teichmuller Theory that must be mastered first. (Those who don't are \"simply not qualified\" to weigh in, says Mochizuki.) Mathematicians aren't saying that Mochizuki's resolution of the theory is wrong, but they're not saying it's right, either. As a result, it's been in a kind of math limbo since 2012, despite attempts by the Kyoto University professor as recently as last month to shed light on it. As for the ABC conjecture, it's a longstanding math problem that also happens to be \"deceptively complicated,\" explains ZME Science. \"It roughly states that three numbers a, b, and c, which have no common factor and satisfy a + b = c cannot be too smooth. ... In number theory, a smooth number is an integer which factors completely into small prime numbers.\" Got that? The upshot, according to both sites, is that the theory raises fundamental questions about the \"nature of numbers,\" and thus its proof would be a major milestone. \"It's a bit disappointing that no one has come out and said it's right or wrong,\" says Oxford professor Minhyong Kim.

(Associated Press) \n \n An autopsy confirmed the identity of Norma Lopez, but investigators would not release the cause of death. \n \n \"I don't want to believe it's her,\" family friend Melanie Villarreal, 18, told The Associated Press. \"We know she's in a better place.\" \n \n Police and the FBI have not identified a suspect and have asked the public for help in the investigation. \n \n \"We do have a few leads that we're still following up ... but I wouldn't say that we're any closer,\" Riverside County sheriff's Sgt. Joseph Borja said. \n \n About 2,000 people gathered around an athletic field at Lopez's school Wednesday evening for a vigil where 16-year-old friend Moises Michel remembered how Lopez loved dance, especially merengue and salsa. \n \n \"Whenever we were bored we'd just dance with each other, we'd get up and dance,\" he said. \"I'm used to seeing her every day smiling. I'm just in shock because I can't believe it.\" \n \n The discovery of the body was reported Tuesday just hours after Lopez's anguished family held a press conference to plead for her return, and authorities said they had no clues and announced a $35,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of whoever abducted her. \n \n Lopez vanished July 15 after leaving a summer school class at Valley View High School, where she would have been a senior this year. Authorities said she was heading to meet a friend. \n \n When she didn't show up, her younger sister and a friend went to look for her, found some of her personal items in a field 1 1/2 blocks from the school, and called authorities, Borja said. \n \n The field, a well-known neighborhood shortcut, is off a street that dead-ends at the base of boulder-studded hills cut with trails. Homes line one side, but in the blazing Wednesday heat the expanse of dirt and dry stubble was deserted. \n \n Searchers fruitlessly covered the area for several days. \n \n On Tuesday, a resident driving his tractor-mower on another remote field found the body near a stretch of desert road more than two miles away. The decomposed body, shirtless and clad in jeans, was found face-down in a grove of trees in the agricultural area on the eastern edge of Moreno Valley. \n \n The mix of suburban-style residential sprawl and large rural areas is common in fast-growing Moreno Valley, a city of 186,000 about 60 miles east of Los Angeles between March Air Reserve Base and a swath of unforgiving, rugged terrain known as The Badlands. \n \n The teen's disappearance drew wide attention across Southern California, where the high-profile abduction-murders of two other teenage girls in San Diego County _ one jogging alone this year and the other walking to school in 2009 _ led to a sex offender who ultimately admitted the killings and is now imprisoned. \n \n \"I believe this has been made personal because we all have children,\" Borja said. \"It's probably our worst nightmare that our kids can just be taken from a street and killed.\" \n \n Borja said it was unknown whether the girl was taken by an acquaintance or a stranger.

The school has about 3,000 students, with 400 in summer classes. \n \n Lopez was taking biology over the summer and was doing well in the class, the principal said. \n \n Hunter said teachers described the teen as a very good student and a quiet girl who never got into trouble. \n \n On Wednesday, incoming seniors came and went from campus to have their class pictures taken. \n \n Jennifer Sanchez, 18, said she knew Lopez through a freshman-year club. \n \n Lopez was sweet and quiet and mostly spent time at school with her older sister, who graduated last year, her younger sister, and her on-and-off boyfriend, Sanchez said. \n \n \"We called them 'the Lopez sisters' because they were really close to each other,\" Michel said. \"They spent a lot of time together.\" \n \n (This version CORRECTS A new approach.

    "document": "Two years ago, Ellen Martinsen, was collecting mosquitoes at the Smithsonian's National Zoo, looking for malaria that might infect birds--when she discovered something strange: a DNA profile, from parasites in the mosquitoes, that she couldn't identify. \n \n By chance, she had discovered a malaria parasite, Plasmodium odocoilei--that infects white-tailed deer. It's the first-ever malaria parasite known to live in a deer species and the only native malaria parasite found in any mammal in North or South America. Though white-tailed deer diseases have been heavily studied--scientist hadn't noticed that many have malaria parasites. \n \n Martinsen and her colleagues estimate that the parasite infects up to twenty-five percent of white-tailed deer along the East Coast of the United States. Their results were published February 5 in Science Advances. \n \n IN HIDING \n \n \"You never know what you're going to find when you're out in nature--and you look,\" says Martinsen, a research associate at the Smithsonian's Conservation Biology Institute and adjunct faculty in the University of Vermont's biology department. \"It's a parasite that has been hidden in the most iconic game animal in the United States. I just stumbled across it.\" \n \n The new study, led by Martinsen, was a collaboration with scientists at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, the American Museum of Natural History, the National Park Service, the University of Georgia, the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee--and UVM biologist and malaria expert Joseph Schall. \n \n Though Martinsen and Schall are quick to note that they anticipate little danger to people from this newly discovered deer malaria, it does underline the fact that many human health concerns are connected to wider ecological systems--and that understanding the biology of other species is a foundation to both conservation and public health management. Zika virus is recently making worrisome headlines and \"there's a sudden surge in interest in mosquito biology across the United States,\" says Schall. \"This is a reminder of the importance of parasite surveys and basic natural history.\" \n \n In 1967, a renowned malaria researcher reported he'd discovered malaria in a single deer in Texas. But the received understanding was that \"malaria wasn't supposed to be in mammals in the New World,\" says Schall, who has studied malaria for decades. \"It was like the guy was reporting he saw Big Foot,\" and no other discoveries were made after that. \n \n But now Martinsen and her colleagues have discovered that the deer malaria is widespread--though it's \"cryptic\" she says, because the parasites occur in very low levels in many of the infected deer. \"Ellen spent days and days looking through a microscope at slides that were mostly empty,\" Schall says, but eventually found the parasites. Combined with sensitive molecular PCR techniques to understand the genetics, the team confirmed a high prevalence of the disease--between eighteen and twenty-five percent--in sites ranging from New York to West Virginia to Louisiana. \n \n NATIVE SPECIES \n \n The new discovery fundamentally changes our understanding of the distribution and evolutionary history of malaria parasites in mammals, Martinsen says. Some scientists wondered if the deer malaria could have jumped from people or zoo animals in the recent past. But the new study suggests otherwise. The team's data shows that the deer actually carry two genetic lineages of the malaria parasites--\"probably different species,\" she says--and that the two lineages are substantially different from each other. \n \n This divergence between the two forms of malaria was used by the scientists as a kind of molecular clock. \"We can date the evolutionary split between those two lineages,\" Martinsen says--to 2.3 to 6 million years ago. Which probably means that when the ancient evolutionary ancestors to white-tailed deer traveled from Eurasia across the Bering Land Bridge to North America in the Miocene, some 4.2 to 5.7 million years ago--malaria came along for the ride. \"We think malaria is native to the Americas,\" Martinsen says, \"that it's been here for millions of years.\" \n \n Malaria is a major problem for people in many parts of the world--and for many species of wildlife too. It has been devastating bird species in Hawaii and Bermuda, among many epidemics. Whether it is hurting white-tailed deer in America is an open question. Martinsen suspects not, because she'd expect to see more obviously sick animals. But Schall wonders if, like some human malaria infections, the disease causes a low-level burden that hurts deer populations. They both agree that it is an area that calls for more research--and that the new study raises many other questions, including whether the parasite might infect dairy cows or other hoofed species. \n \n Ellen Martinsen completed her undergraduate and doctoral training at UVM in Joe Schall's lab and went on to do her postdoctoral research at the Smithonian Conservation Biology Institute's Center for Conservation Genetics. The new discovery drew on a team of scientists and veterinarians at the Smithsonian and other institutions, who studied samples from both live and necropsied deer as well as mosquitoes. Additionally, Martinsen returned to Schall's lab for some of the new research. \n \n \"Malaria is a top parasitic disease in humans and wildlife,\" Ellen Martinsen says. \"It's important that we gain a better understanding of its diversity and distribution not just across humans but across other species too.\" \n \n ### ||||| North America\u2019s most popular game species, the white-tailed deer, harbors a secret: low levels of a malaria parasite that have only now been detected thanks to advanced DNA technology. Though this particular species of parasite poses little risk to humans, researchers say the find could reshape our understanding of malaria\u2019s origins. \n \n There are more than 100 species of malaria parasites, distributed on every continent except Antarctica. Those that infect birds and lizards are widely distributed, even on seemingly isolated ocean islands, and certainly in the Americas. Yet scientists believed that the microorganisms that infect mammals originated in the Old World, mainly Africa and Asia. \n \n The new findings were discovered by chance. Researchers led by Ellen Martinsen, a biologist at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute\u2019s genetics center in Washington, D.C., were searching for the source of malaria parasites in birds at the national zoo. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, which amplifies DNA to make it easier to study, they identified a genetic signature of an unexpected malaria parasite, Plasmodium odocoilei, previously unknown in the Americas. The researchers were able to obtain a large enough sample of blood from the mosquito\u2019s enlarged abdomen to trace its origin to white-tailed deer. \u201cWe weren\u2019t out there, testing a hypothesis,\u201d Martinsen says. \u201cWe serendipitously stumbled upon this weird sequence.\u201d \n \n To find out how common the infections are, the researchers screened more than 300 white-tailed deer with PCR. They found 41 animals harbored the parasite, from 10 of the 17 states surveyed. No infected deer were identified in the west, but in the east, malaria parasites were widespread. Twenty-five percent of the animals tested at sites in Virginia and West Virginia carried them, the team reports today in Science Advances. \n \n No signs of the parasite turned up in the other hooved species they tested, including cows, gazelles, goats, elk, oryx, alpaca, donkeys, and Przewalski horses. \n \n The study marks the first finding of a malaria parasite species of mammals that is native to the Americas. (Scientists had largely discounted the significance of a 1967 report of what appears to be the same parasite in single specimen of white-tailed deer in Texas.) \n \n The new research suggests that these malaria parasites have a long evolutionary history in the New World, dating back to the ancestors of white-tailed deer that made their way to the continent across the Bering Land Bridge 2.3 million to 6 million years ago Other as-yet-to-be discovered malaria parasites of mammals may be \u201chidden in plain sight,\u201d the researchers write. \n \n The findings are especially surprising in light of how intensively the popular game species has been studied, says David Hewitt, a wildlife biologist at Texas A&M University, Kingsville, who was not involved in the research. \u201cThis story suggests there is still much we don\u2019t know about the natural world.\u201d \n \n Martinsen says future research should examine whether low-level parasite infection has caused disease in deer that previously has been undetected.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Talk about a surprise: Two years ago, scientists researching avian malaria happened to learn that two strains of the parasite are infecting white-tailed deer\u2014possibly 25% of those living on the East Coast, Smithsonian reports. Until then, no endemic malaria had been seen in North or South American mammals. \"You never know what you're going to find when you're out in nature\u2014and you look,\" says lead study author Ellen Martinsen, per a press release. \"It's a parasite that has been hidden in the most iconic game animal in the United States. I just stumbled across it.\" Her team was screening mosquitoes for avian malaria at the Smithsonian's National Zoo in Washington, DC, when they stumbled across some surprise DNA and found that the insect had fed on white-tailed deer. Researchers then screened more than 300 white-tailed deer and found the parasite in 41 of them, in roughly half the states studied, Science reports. None were in the west, but it was common in the east, particularly in West Virginia and Virginia. Seems the two malaria species pose little risk to deer or to people: Though humans haven't been tested for the strains yet, co-author Robert Fleischer says \"if it\u2019s getting into humans, which it probably is, it probably isn\u2019t able to reproduce. ... This is not Zika virus.\" The deer's ancestors may have brought the parasite into North America by way of the Beringia land bridge millions of years ago, researchers say. So how is it no one noticed malaria before in the much-studied deer? \"This story suggests there is still much we don\u2019t know about the natural world,\" says a biologist not involved in the study. (Meanwhile, Lyme disease is spreading across US counties.)",

The parasite infects up to twenty-five percent of deer along the East Coast of the U.S. The new discovery fundamentally changes our understanding of the distribution and evolutionary history of malaria parasites in mammals, says Ellen Martinsen, the study's lead researcher. \"It's a parasite that has been hidden in the most iconic game animal in the United States,\" she says, \"and I just stumbled across it\" \"This is a reminder of the importance of parasite surveys and basic natural history,\" says malaria expert Joseph Schall.",

Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest \n \n Around 1 a.m. on June 7, 2014, 35-year-old Kevin Roper \u2013 then halfway through the 13th hour of his 14-hour shift \u2013 slammed into Morgan\u2019s limo from behind, killing comedian James McNair and seriously injuring Morgan and three others. \n \n Before starting his Wal-Mart shift, Roper had driven 12 hours in his personal vehicle from his home in Georgia to his base in Delaware, according to the NTSB. \n \n His \u201cdecision to drive 800 miles overnight\u201d was \u201ca factor in the crash,\u201d NTSB senior accident investigator Dennis Collins said today. \n \n Though Wal-Mart provided fatigue information during its driver training, it was not required to have a fatigue management program,the NTSB said. \n \n Moments before the crash, the trailer was traveling at 65 mph, 20 mph over the construction zone\u2019s 45 mph speed limit. \n \n \u201cHad the truck driver been traveling at the posted work zone speed limit of 45 mph, it could have been stopped before impact,\u201d NTSB investigator David Rayburn said today. \n \n Roper's attorney told ABC News he would dispute the NTSB's conclusions. \n \n The passengers in the rear of the limo\u2019s rear compartment were not wearing seatbelts at the time of the crash, NTSB chairman Christopher Hart announced at a board meeting today, nor had they received a safety briefing outlining the benefits of seat belts. \n \n After being hit by the Wal-Mart truck, the limo then struck three other vehicles and rolled over before coming to rest on its side on the New Jersey Turnpike. \n \n Because the limo had been customized, \u201cthe passengers had no available exits until emergency responders removed parts of a plywood panel that had been installed,\u201d Hart said today. \n \n Indeed, it took nearly 40 minutes for first responders to extricate some of the victims from the limo. \n \n \u201cI shudder to think what would have happened if this vehicle had caught fire,\u201d NTSB board member Robert Sumwalt noted. \n \n Roper was later charged with one count of vehicular homicide and several counts of assault by auto, with authorities saying they believed he had dozed off behind the wheel. He pleaded not guilty. \n \n The crash left Morgan, then 45, in critical condition, with multiple broken bones and a traumatic brain injury. \n \n Since then, the comedian has \u201cstruggled\u201d to regain his old self, his lawyer said. \n \n In a June 2015 interview with \u201cToday\u201d anchor Matt Lauer, Morgan wondered through tears whether he was ever \u201cgoing to be funny again.\u201d \n \n He filed a civil suit against Wal-Mart; they reached a confidential settlement in May. \n \n The retailer, which initially faulted Morgan and his colleagues for not wearing seat belts, later \u201ctook full responsibility for the accident,\u201d according to Morgan\u2019s lawyer. ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A Wal-Mart truck driver who hadn't slept in 28 hours failed to slow down despite posted warning signs and was responsible for a highway crash last year that severely injured comedian Tracy Morgan and killed another comedian, the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday. \n \n FILE - In this April 9, 2014, file photo, actor Tracy Morgan attends the FX Networks Upfront premiere screening of \"Fargo\" at the SVA Theater in New York. The National Transportation Safety Board is meeting...

(Associated Press) \n \n An accident description is displayed on a large screen as the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) meets at their headquarters in Washington, Tuesday, Aug. 11, 2015, to determine the cause of... (Associated Press) \n \n But the board said the failure of Morgan and other passengers in a limousine-van to wear seat belts and adjust headrests contributed to the severity of injuries when the limo was struck from behind by the truck. \n \n Most of their injuries were caused when the passengers were whipped around or thrown into the sides of the vehicle, the board said at a meeting to determine the cause of the crash and make safety recommendations. \n \n None of the passengers in the back of the 10-seat limo or the driver was wearing a seat belt. \n \n The board said truck driver Kevin Roper of Jonesboro, Georgia, could have prevented the June 7, 2014, crash if he had slowed to 45 mph, the posted speed limit for the construction work zone on the New Jersey Turnpike near Cranbury, where the crash occurred. \n \n The truck traveled 0.9 miles past the first work zone sign and more than 0.4 miles past the 45 mph speed limit sign without slowing from 65 mph. The truck was going that fast until it reached a closing distance of approximately 200 feet before the impact. \n \n At 45 mph, the truck could have stopped before impact, the board concluded. \n \n The collision with the limo started a chain reaction crash that affected 21 people in six vehicles. \n \n \"One tragic aspect of roadway deaths is that so often they could have been prevented,\" said the safety board's chairman, Chris Hart. \n \n Heavy trucks are involved in nearly 1 in 8 fatal crashes, NTSB said. In work zones, 1 in 4 fatal crashes involves a heavy truck. \n \n Roper had driven over 800 miles overnight from Georgia to a Wal-Mart distribution center in Delaware to pick up a load before starting the trip without stopping for sleep. \n \n He had worked for Wal-Mart for 15 weeks and had had nine \"critical event reports.\" Critical event reports, which are generated by a truck's computers and downloaded by Wal-Mart, record things such as hard braking, activation of the vehicle's stability control system or other events that might indicate unsafe driving. \n \n Roper also had been involved in a preventable accident, causing him to lose his safety bonus, investigators said. \n \n Wal-Mart had provided guidance to its drivers on preventing fatigue, but didn't have a comprehensive program to prevent drivers from being assigned over-tiring schedules or to make sure they were rested before reporting to work, the board said. Since then, Wal-Mart has taken greater steps to educate drivers about fatigue and has said it will put in place a program to reduce fatigue, investigators said. \n \n The board has long raised concerns about operator fatigue leading to accidents across all modes of transportation, from airline pilots to train engineers. \n \n Investigators said the limo wound up on its side with its rear doors jammed shut. A sheet of plywood that had been added to the limo to separate the cab from passengers blocked occupants from escaping the vehicle through the front doors after the crash. \n \n It took emergency responders working with the assistance of other motorists 37 minutes to remove the first of the crash victims from the rear of the limo. \n \n Investigators said emergency responders, mostly volunteers, didn't have the training to address some of the logistical and coordination issues arising from the complicated accident. New Jersey doesn't have requirements for the number of training hours that volunteer emergency responders must have, or a certification program, they said. \n \n Comedian James \"Jimmy Mack\" McNair of Peekskill, New York, a mentor of Morgan's, was killed. Morgan suffered head trauma, and was in a coma for two weeks. Three other passengers in the limo suffered serious injuries. \n \n Morgan, a former \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"30 Rock\" star, and the others were returning from a show in Dover, Delaware. \n \n Roper was charged with death by auto and four counts of assault by auto in state court in New Jersey. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Joan Lowy on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/AP_Joan_Lowy",

This study was conducted to show what alcohol consumption would look like when all of what is sold is accounted for, if everyone under-reported equally. \n \n \"The results are putative, but they show that this gap between what is seen in the surveys and sales potentially has enormous implications for public health in England.\" \n \n The team used alcohol sales data from Revenue and Customs and compared it with two self-reporting alcohol consumption surveys conducted in 2008 - the General Lifestyle Survey (GLF) which analysed average weekly alcohol consumption in 12,490 adults, and the Health Survey for England (HSE) which looked at consumption on the heaviest drinking day in the previous week among 9,608 adults. \n \n Counting units \n \n The researchers say they will now look at the characteristics of those that are under-reporting the number of drinks they have had, and why. \n \n They suggest it may be down to drinking patterns and habits - those that are mixing drinks, and drinking at different venues, may be more likely to under-report. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Alcohol Concern's Eric Appleby: \"Particularly when we drink at home, we pour much larger measures\" \n \n The charity Alcohol Concern suggests irregular and chaotic drinking behaviour may play a part: \"When we're totting up our drinks total we don't always count some occasions as proper drinking. \n \n \"We may underestimate drink sizes and their alcoholic content, and not count holidays and special occasions like weddings, birthdays and Christmas when we often drink a great deal more than usual.\" \n \n The researchers suggest that government drinking guidelines need to reflect actual consumption instead of reported drinking - especially when ascertaining what levels are associated with harm. \n \n The Department of Health says this will be taken into consideration in their alcohol consumption review. \n \n It said: \"We already know people underestimate what they drink and many drink too much. That's why we work to help people make healthier decisions, including the recent Change For Life campaign to help them track consumption and understand the impact on their health. \n \n \"We're also tackling excessive drinking through our proposed minimum unit price at 45p per unit, tougher licensing laws, more GP risk assessments, better access to specialist nurses and more specialised treatment.\" \n \n Diane Abbott MP, Labour's shadow public health minister, said: \"This has got to be a wake-up call for the government and the country, because after more than two years of bitter internal rows, the government has got cold feet about its only proposed alcohol harm policy. \n \n \"More needs to be done to tackle problem drinking, which costs the country \u00a321bn.\"",

Wakefield was also stripped of his medical license. \n \n De Niro's statement has sparked even more controversy as the actor's decision to include the documentary as part of the film festival that he helped found represents only one side of the anti-vaccination debate. Filmmaker Penny Lane, who made the documentary Nuts! about a snake oil salesman and medical fraud in general, penned an open letter to the Tribeca Film Festival asking them to reconsider the Vaxxed screening. \n \n \"While it is true that we documentary filmmakers constantly debate vexing questions about the perceived and real differences between our work and the work of traditional journalism, I assure you that we are not debating whether it is okay to knowingly spread dangerous lies,\" Lane wrote of Wakefield. \"In other words: issues around truth and ethics in documentary can get thorny.

Huge news tomorrow.\u201d \n \n Perhaps he hadn\u2019t \u201cposted forever\u201d because the media finally stopped giving him a megaphone. Perhaps once people in America and England began dying of measles, journalists finally realized that the \u201ctwo sides to every story\u201d approach granted Wakefield was literally killing people. \n \n Last I heard, Wakefield was headlining Conspira-Sea, a seven-day cruise where passengers learn about crop circles, chemtrails, yogic flying, ESP and astrology. Good, I thought, that\u2019s where he belongs. \n \n Well, not so fast. It seems the quack is back. Wakefield\u2019s \u201chuge news\u201d is that he is now a documentary film director, and that his new film Vaxxed: From Cover-up to Catastrophe will premiere at the prestigious Tribeca Film Festival this April. \n \n Your film festival guide suggests that if I\u2019m interested in Vaxxed, I might also be interested in the category of \u201cdocumentaries.\u201d Well, as a documentary filmmaker who spent eight years making a film about a quack: yes, Tribeca Film Festival, I am very interested in both your choice to screen Vaxxed and in the field of documentary film. \n \n I have always admired Tribeca\u2019s ambitious and broad documentary programming. I first saw (T)ERROR there, and The Genius of Marian, and Tomorrow We Disappear, and Thank You For Playing, and Give Up Tomorrow, and Let The Fire Burn \u2013 and so many other excellent films. And this is what makes your decision all the more pernicious: audiences have come to expect excellence from your documentary programming. \n \n When The Los Angeles Times contacted you for comment, they received this response: \u201cTribeca, as most film festivals, is about dialogue and discussion. Over the years we have presented many films from opposing sides of an issue. We are a forum, not a judge.\u201d \n \n Here is the problem with your statement: it assumes that Vaxxed is just like any other film taking on an unpopular, controversial or provocative subject. It is not. There is a big difference between advocacy and fraud, between point of view and deception. For you to claim there is no difference helps to perpetuate Wakefield\u2019s fraud. \n \n Also, it is disingenuous for you to claim you are not a \u201cjudge.\u201d You are literally judging when you choose a film, from thousands of submissions, to screen under your banner. \n \n A lot of people, including those who buy tickets to see docs at your festival, believe documentary film has become a new and important form of news. But journalists are expected to tell the truth \u2014 or at least not knowingly spread dangerous lies. Your choice to include Vaxxed in your documentary lineup \u2014 a lineup including films about abortion, Syrian refugees, solitary confinement, the American electoral system, in-vitro fertilization and drone warfare \u2014 suggests that you think documentary filmmakers can\u2019t be held even to the latter standard. This threatens the credibility of not just the other filmmakers in your doc slate, but the field in general. \n \n So yes, I take this personally. \n \n While it is true that we documentary filmmakers constantly debate vexing questions about the perceived and real differences between our work and the work of traditional journalism, I assure you that we are not debating whether it is okay to knowingly spread dangerous lies. \n \n Consider how many lies there are in the first 30 seconds of the Vaxxed trailer. Wakefield\u2019s cinematic disregard of the truth means his film should not be called a documentary any more than Loose Change is. \n \n In other words: issues around truth and ethics in documentary can get thorny. But this one is easy. This film is not some sort of disinterested investigation into the \u201cvaccines cause autism\u201d hoax; this film is directed by the person who perpetuated the hoax. \n \n And this hoax isn\u2019t cute, or fun, or thought-provoking. Very possibly, some people will walk away from your festival having been convinced, in part because of your good name and the excellence and integrity of your documentary programming, not to vaccinate their children. And very possibly people will die as a result. \n \n There\u2019s no shame in having been taken in by quack \u2013 the reason I made NUTS! is that I wanted to explore just how easy it is to fall for a quack, especially one cloaked in the authority of a documentary film. \n \n I believe you were fooled in just this way: taken in by an apparently legitimate \u201cdocumentary\u201d film, a film which unethically used the tools of my trade toward bad ends. I believe you made a very serious (if human) mistake. But it\u2019s not too late to fix it. You can still apologize for your error and cancel the screening. \n \n I know that some people will say I\u2019m advocating censorship when I say this. I appreciate that concern. The last thing I would want is for festivals to stop being bold, independent tastemakers afraid of controversy.

    "document": "Deep beneath the surface of the Earth, in a dank and dismal cave, lives Hades, the invertebrate king of hell. \n \n Named for the mythological god of the underworld, Geophilus hadesi is a newly discovered species of centipede that inhabits the deep caves of the Velebit Mountains in Croatia. Unlike most centipedes of the order Geophilomorpha, which only occasionally seek shelter in caves, G. hadesi spends all its life in this dark, underground environment. Today (June 30), the team of scientists who discovered the remarkable critter published the first-ever description of the animal in the journal ZooKeys. \n \n G. hadesi is one of only two known species of centipedes that never leave their cavernous homes. The other underground dweller, Geophilus persephones (named for the queen of the underworld, Persephone), was first discovered in a cave in France in the 1990s. G. hadesi was named with this mythical queen in mind, according to Pavel Stoev, an associate professor of zoology at the National Museum of Natural History in Sofia, Bulgaria, and lead author of the paper detailing the new centipede species. [Creepy Crawlies & Flying Wonders: Incredible Cave Creatures] \n \n Though its home, located nearly two-thirds of a mile (1 kilometer) below the Earth's surface, is a bit dark and gloomy, G. hadesi survives just fine, Stoev told Live Science. It has \"exceptionally elongated\" antennae and furlike body hair, or setae, covering its appendages, and these two features let the animal detect prey in total darkness, Stoev told Live Science. \n \n Like most centipedes, G. hadesi feeds on living animals \u2014 most likely larvae, springtails (tiny, insectlike hexapods), worms, woodlice, spiders and other small prey. Though the centipede's bite is venomous, this \"hellish\" creature is likely completely harmless to humans, Stoev said. Not that G. hadesi spends much time with people. While scientists from the Croatian Biospeleogical Society have explored the Velebit Mountains where the Hades centipede lives, some of the crevices it inhabits are unreachable. One specimen was collected from a depth of 3,609 feet (1,100 meters), the deepest known habitat for any centipede. \n \n G. hadesi has a long, flattened body that makes crawling around such rocky crevices easy. And its 33 pairs of legs end in thin claws that are \"unusually long,\" according to the researchers. Like other creatures with pointy claws, such as the yeti crabs that inhabit the waters off Antarctica, the Hades centipede may have developed this feature in order to cling more securely to rocks. \n \n \"The change of a species' appearance is usually a result of a long evolution that is likely to have happened [over] the course of millions of years,\" said Stoev, who noted that the Hades centipede has also adapted to the deep caves' cold temperatures, which can drop as low as 37 degrees Fahrenheit (3 degrees Celsius). \n \n Scientists aren't exactly sure why the Hades centipede started living underground in the first place (though it likely had nothing to do with losing a bet to Zeus and Poseidon). \n \n \"It could be a dramatic change in the outside temperatures and overall conditions that forced less-adaptive organisms to seek shelter underground where the conditions are more stable and less dependent on the outside fluctuations,\" Stoev said. \n \n The Hades centipede isn't the only critter that inhabits the caves of Velebit mountain range, which spans 90 miles (145 km) of northwest Croatia. Scientists have already discovered a whole host of pale, cave-dwelling creatures there. And many more creatures likely remain to be discovered, Poev said. \n \n Follow Elizabeth Palermo @techEpalermo. Follow Live Science @livescience, Facebook & Google+. Original article on Live Science. ||||| An international team of scientists has discovered the deepest underground dwelling centipede. The animal was found by members of the Croatian Biospeleological Society in three caves in Velebit Mts, Croatia. Recorded as deep as -1100 m the new species was named Geophilus hadesi, after Hades, the God of the Underworld in the Greek Mythology. The research was published in the open access journal ZooKeys. \n \n Lurking in the dark vaults of some of the world's deepest caves, the Hades centipede has also had its name picked to pair another underground-dwelling relative named after Persephone, the queen of the underworld. \n \n Centipedes are carnivores that feed on other invertebrate animals. They are common cave inhabitants but members of this particular order, called geophilomorphs, usually find shelter there only occasionally. Species with an entire life cycle confined to cave environments are exceptionally rare in the group. \n \n In fact, so far the Hades and Persephone centipedes are the only two geophilomorphs that have adapted to live exclusively in caves, thus rightfully bearing the titles of a queen and king of the underworld. \n \n Like most cave-dwellers, the newly discovered centipede shows unusual traits, some of which commonly found in cave-dwelling arthropods, including much elongated antennae, trunk segments and leg claws. Equipped with powerful jaws bearing poison glands and long curved claws allowing to grasp and tightly hold its prey, the Hades centipede is among the top predators crawling in the darkness of the cave. \n \n The new species is yet another addition to the astonishing cave critters that live in the Velebit, a mountain that stretches over 145 km in the Croatian Dinaric Karst, which is as a whole considered a hot spot of subterranean diversity. The deepest record comes from the Lukina jama - Trojama cave system, which is 1431 meters deep and is currently ranked the 15th deepest cave in the world. \n \n Just like Hades who ruled over the kingdom of shadows, the new centipede dwells among an extraordinary number of pallid cavernicolous animals, some known to science and many yet to be discovered. \n \n \"When I first saw the animal and its striking appearance, I immediately realized that this is a new, hitherto unnamed and highly adapted to cave environment species. This finding comes to prove once again how little we know about the life in caves, where even in the best prospected areas, one can still find incredible animals\" says the lead author Pavel Stoev, Pensoft Publishers and National Museum of Natural History, Sofia. \n \n ### \n \n Original Source: \n \n Stoev P, Akkari N, Komeri\u010dki A, Edgecombe GD, Bonato L (2015) At the end of the rope: Geophilus hadesi sp. n. - the world's deepest cave-dwelling centipede (Chilopoda, Geophilomorpha, Geophilidae).

    "document": "Boehner absolves GOP defectors, seeks to reassert his command \n \n By Russell Berman - \n \n Battered by division and defections, Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) is setting out to re-unify his conference and prove to Democrats in the White House and the Senate that he can command a governing majority of the House. \n \n Boehner, who lost 12 of his members in a surprisingly hairy reelection vote, took the first steps in a closed-door conference meeting Friday morning. Boehner told lawmakers he would not seek to punish the Republicans who deserted him on the House floor Thursday. \n \n \"I'm not a retribution kind of guy. I don't hold grudges,\" Boehner said in the meeting, according to several people in the room. \"My door is always open, whether you voted for me, or didn\u2019t vote for me.\u201d \n \n Lawmakers say the next two to three months of fiscal battles will be a crucial period for Boehner, who begins the 113th Congress with a smaller majority that includes a cadre of conservatives who have gone public in their opposition to his leadership. \n \n The Speaker's immediate goal, members say, is to craft legislation that raises the debt ceiling and cuts spending while winning 218 Republican votes in the House. \n \n \u201cOne, we have to craft the right legislation. Two, we have to have a spirit of teamwork within our caucus,\u201d second-term Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.) said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to be passing bills that can get to 218 out of here.\u201d \n \n For Boehner, getting Republicans on the same page has been harder than ever in the two months since the November election. He could not rally his conference around a fallback \"fiscal-cliff\" bill in December, and nearly two-thirds of House Republicans voted against the final Senate compromise on New Year's Day. \n \n Beyond fiscal issues, however, Republicans pushed back and ultimately scrapped plans to vote on a five-year farm bill and major postal reform, in large measure because the leadership could not secure enough GOP votes to pass them. \n \n The defections against Boehner in the vote for Speaker made clear that his struggle to unify the House GOP will continue in the 113th Congress. They serve as a warning to Boehner of the risks in repeatedly bringing bills to the floor that do not have majority Republican support. \n \n \u201cClearly, this is not a group of trained poodles on the House floor,\u201d Huizenga said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got some very independent-thinking, strong-willed people, and that\u2019s healthy for a democracy.\u201d \n \n The House is on recess next week, and lawmakers expect the debt-ceiling bill to be a central topic of discussion at the party's annual retreat in Williamsburg on Jan. 17-18. \n \n At the conference meeting Friday, Boehner told House Republicans he would insist that an increase in the debt limit be accompanied by spending cuts and that the public was on the GOP\u2019s side. \n \n \u201cWith the [fiscal] cliff behind us, the focus turns to spending,\u201d Boehner said, according to a person in the room. \u201cThe president says he isn't going to have a debate with us over the debt ceiling. He also says he's not going to cut spending along with the debt limit hike.\u201d \n \n The Speaker cited a new poll conducted just before the new year by the Winston Group, a Republican firm, which found that 72 percent of respondents \u201cagree any increase in the nation's debt limit must be accompanied by spending cuts and reforms of a greater amount.\u201d \n \n Boehner first laid out that principle in a 2011 speech in New York, and has said he will stick to it as Congress debates the debt ceiling in the next two months. The Treasury Department said the nation hit its $16.4-trillion borrowing limit in late December and estimates the next increase must occur before March. \n \n President Obama has vowed not to negotiate over the debt ceiling again, setting up another confrontation in the weeks ahead. Republicans will also be looking at the same time to enact spending cuts to replace automatic reductions to defense and domestic spending set now to take effect in March. And Congress faces another deadline one month later to extend government funding and prevent a shutdown. \n \n Rep. James Lankford (R-Okla.), the new chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, said the party has found more success unifying around policies it opposes than coalescing around positions it supports. \n \n \u201cThere has to be a lot of communication as to where we\u2019re going to try to go,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t get to a focus on what we are going to do, then it is a little more challenging.\u201d \n \n Lankford said the House GOP is determined to act affirmatively on the debt ceiling, in the hopes it will put pressure on the Senate and not be forced to accept a last-minute compromise, as it has in year-end tax battles in both 2011 and 2012. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re going to get ahead of it, I can tell you that,\u201d Lankford said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to wait until the last second.\u201d \n \n While many lawmakers bemoaned the defections from Boehner as an embarrassment that weakens his leadership, Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.) said it could help him in one respect. \n \n \u201cIn a bizarre way, I think it strengthens Boehner\u2019s hand,\u201d said Griffith, a former majority leader of the Virginia House of Delegates. \u201cIt makes it clear to the president that he\u2019s got a bunch of folks who want to do something about spending, and they\u2019re serious.\u201d \n \n As a former legislative leader, Griffith said he empathized with Boehner, even if he didn\u2019t always agree with him. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s also easier to sit on the outside of a leadership position and throw stones,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s much harder to be in his shoes.\u201d ||||| President Barack Obama is hailing a last-minute deal that avoids the so-called fiscal cliff but says it's just one step in a broader effort to boost the economy and shrink federal deficits. \n \n FILE - In this Tuesday, Jan. 1, 2013, file photo, the dome of the Capitol is reflected in a skylight of the Capitol Visitor's Center in Washington. By delaying hard choices on spending, the fiscal cliff... (Associated Press) \n \n Obama said in his radio and Internet address Saturday that the new law _ approved by Congress on New Year's Day and signed Thursday _ raises taxes on the wealthiest Americans while preventing a middle-class tax hike that could have thrown the economy back into recession. \n \n With the \"fiscal cliff\" crisis barely over, Obama faces new battles in Congress over raising the country's $16.4 trillion borrowing limit, as well as more than $100 billion in automatic spending cuts for the military and domestic programs which were delayed by two months under the compromise. \n \n Lawmakers promise to replace those across-the-board cuts with more targeted steps that could take longer to implement. \n \n Obama _ speaking from Hawaii, where he is on vacation with his family _ said he is willing to consider more spending cuts and tax increases to reduce the deficit. \n \n But he said he \"will not compromise\" over his insistence that Congress lift the federal debt ceiling without negotiations. The nation's credit rating was downgraded the last time lawmakers threatened inaction on the debt ceiling, in 2011. \n \n \"Our families and our businesses cannot afford that dangerous game again,\" Obama said. \n \n If elected officials from both parties \"focus on the interests of our country above the interests of party, I'm convinced we can cut spending and raise revenue in a manner that reduces our deficit and protects the middle class,\" Obama said. \n \n In the Republican address, Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan said that as attention again turns to the debt limit, \"we must identify responsible ways to tackle Washington's wasteful spending.\" \n \n Americans know that \"when you have no more money in your account and your credit cards are maxed out, then the spending must stop,\" Camp said.",

    "document": "Interminable car chases, disgustingly cute animals, blunt-force pleas to patriotism: These are a few of Anchorman 2\u2019s favorite targets. A silly sequel to the 2004 Will Ferrell breakout comedy, this new chapter manages to make some smart satirical hay in the course of its stupidity. \n \n The year is 1980, and Ferrell\u2019s Ron Burgundy, the fatuous, egomaniacal co-anchor of a local San Diego newscast, is on the outs. Ron\u2019s boss, played by Harrison Ford, has finally realized how dumb the guy is. Luckily there\u2019s a brand-new medium perfect for his IQ level: 24-hour cable news. \n \n After a Blues Brothers-like sequence of rounding up the old team \u2014 childlike weatherman Brick Tamland (Steve Carell), narcissistic reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd) and racist/sexist sports guy Champ Kind (David Koech- ner) \u2014 Ron heads to New York to make his name in the brave new world of nonstop blather. \n \n The team behind the original Anchorman was reluctant to tackle a sequel, and it\u2019s easy to see why. Anchorman 2 indulges the mandate to dip into the well of old bits over and over again, from the jazz flute solo to the gangland rumble between rival news organizations, which bursts into a supernova of cameo appearances and is, frankly, very funny. \n \n Then there\u2019s the need for a transformative life experience to shake up Ron\u2019s world, which lingers far too long and smacks of desperation. At times, Anchorman 2 blurs the line between depicting stupid and being stupid. \n \n At other times, it\u2019s a spot-on parody, not just of cable news\u2019 dawn but also its current incarnation. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just tell them what they want to hear?\u201d Ron asks of his GNN bosses, and proceeds to do just that. The screen becomes a perpetual m\u00e9lange of impenetrable graphics and data. \n \n One segment features puppies frolicking in a field of American flags. Ron coins a new sign-off: \u201cDon\u2019t just have a great night. Have an American night.\u201d Wall-to-wall coverage of a frantic police chase scores huge ratings, with narration placing speculation over fact. That segment leads to one of the funniest lines in the movie, shouted by an appreciative barfly: \u201cWhen did the news get awesome?!\u201d \n \n For every tiresome patch of shoehorned plot, most of it concerning Ron and his estranged wife, Veronica (Christina Applegate, underused), Anchorman 2 offers a healthy slab of satire. It\u2019s not quite kin to Network or A Face in the Crowd; the need for easy laughs precludes genuine outrage, which in its own way can become a burden. No one really wants a scolding Ron Burgundy. \n \n But it\u2019s still fun to see him channel a little Howard Beale when conscience comes a-calling. Like its predecessor, Anchorman 2 is at its best when it abandons story contrivance in favor of comic anarchy. At one point, Brick, who gets an equally dense love interest in Kristen Wiig\u2019s network receptionist, seizes the anchor chair and gets a chance to show his stuff. He responds by reciting \u201cItsy Bitsy Spider.\u201d \n \n As the climactic gang rumble reaches fever pitch, Ron realizes the danger. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta get out of here!\u201d he shouts. \u201cThere\u2019s too much news!\u201d True indeed, Ron. And yet, so little. \n \n Follow Chris Vognar on Twitter at @chrisvognar. \n \n Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues (B) \n \n Directed by Adam McKay.

In wide release. ||||| Ron Burgundy\u2019s Boob Tube Goes 24 Hours a Day \u2018Anchorman 2,\u2019 Starring Will Ferrell and Steve Carell \n \n \u201cAnchorman 2: The Legend Continues\u201d is in danger of being overshadowed by its own marketing campaign . The recent media appearances by Ron Burgundy \u2014 impersonated, if you need reminding, by Will Ferrell \u2014 have the quality of commercial performance art. He has been ubiquitous, hawking Dodge Durango trucks , accepting a tribute from a journalism school and matching wits with members of the profession he exists to lampoon. That television news has so eagerly embraced Ron Burgundy may be evidence that the \u201cAnchorman\u201d movies don\u2019t go far enough, satirically speaking. The man may be a vain, ethically obtuse, generally clueless buffoon, but it would not occur to him to allow a fictional character on his air to sell a product. He\u2019s no George Stephanopoulos. \n \n The new movie, meanwhile, recaptures the silly, sloppy spirit of its predecessor, minus the crucial element of surprise. It\u2019s a frequently amusing, occasionally hilarious, rarely unpleasant grab bag of mild mockery and inspired lunacy, decked out with cameos from beloved comic performers and random celebrities. There is jazz flute-playing and a big news-team rumble, which fans will be glad to see but which don\u2019t have quite the same impact the second time around. \n \n The first \u201cAnchorman,\u201d released in the summer of 2004, marked a watershed in the emergence of what French critics (who take such things very seriously) have declared a new golden age of American comedy. Directed, like the sequel, by Adam McKay and produced by Judd Apatow, it combined aggressive, obnoxious humor with disarming, childish sweetness and gave the world a handful of immortal catchphrases. \n \n It has all stayed classy, even if it\u2019s not such a big deal anymore. This time, as the \u201970s shade into the \u201980s, offering new wardrobe and song-cue opportunities, Ron and his pals find themselves present for the birth of 24-hour cable news. Ron and his wife, Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate), have a young son (named Walter, as in Cronkite, played by Judah Nelson), but their relationship hits a snag when she is promoted over him at the network that moved them out of San Diego. Ron, his male pride wounded and his professional dignity challenged, goes into a tailspin that is halted when a cable producer (Dylan Baker) recruits him for a new all-news-all-the-time venture. \u201cThat\u2019s the stupidest idea I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d Ron exclaims. That may be the smartest thing he has ever said. \n \n The movie traces the mythic origins of the worst of modern cable news \u2014 the mindless jingoism, the split-screen shouting, the cluttered graphics, the breathless coverage of car chases and celebrity nonsense \u2014 to Ron\u2019s initiative. \u201cI\u2019m the one who opened the bottle and let the genie out,\u201d he says proudly. But the whole point of the \u201cAnchorman\u201d franchise has always been that you can\u2019t stay mad at this guy. You can almost imagine \u2014 or at least wish \u2014 that the real people responsible for the coarsening of civic discourse are just dumb and lovable, rather than greedy and evil. Ron may be sexist, pompous, politically insensitive and hideously dressed, but Mr. Ferrell, with his lumbering frame and twinkling eyes, always tugs him back toward cuddliness. \n \n He is joined by the sidekicks from \u201cAnchorman\u201d \u2014 David Koechner, Steve Carell and Paul Rudd \u2014 and a few new faces. Meagan Good shows admirable gameness as Ron\u2019s designated straight man, his temporary love interest and the occasion for some pretend-provocative bouts of racial humor. The clueless, nervous white guy at an African-American family dinner is one of the oldest jokes in the book, and Mr. Ferrell and Mr. McKay don\u2019t exactly write a new page. But again, no one is likely to get too mad at Ron\u2019s jive talking or his old-school male chauvinism. You might as well object to his mustache. \n \n Some viewers may be bored, however, as this legend meanders down a few comic blind alleys. A movie like \u201cAnchorman 2,\u201d in essence a very long character-based sketch, is always a hit-and-miss affair. The sheer density of the jokes guarantees a few laughs for every taste, though, and the loose, improvisational energy of the performers keeps things lively. The original cast members show the passage of time in their faces and bodies, with the uncanny exception of Mr. Rudd, the Dorian Gray of the New American Comedy. \n \n The sillier \u201cAnchorman 2\u201d gets, the better it works. In other words, it pretty much belongs to Mr. Carell, as the transcendently dim weatherman Brick Tamland, and to Kristen Wiig, as Chani, a co-worker who turns out to be Brick\u2019s soul mate. Their romance lifts the movie into a realm of pure nonsense, and their graceful, inventive idiocy makes the rest of it look labored and overdone. \n \n Which is not to say that Brick and Chani should have their own movie. Too much of any one thing would spoil the fun of the whole, which depends on quick transitions from one setup to the next and an overall sense of anarchic busyness. \u201cAnchorman 2\u201d supplies that, as expected, even as it also feels like old news. \n \n \u201cAnchorman 2: The Legend Continues\u201d is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Just naughty enough for cable. \n \n Anchorman 2 \n \n The Legend Continues \n \n Opens on Wednesday. \n \n Directed by Adam McKay; written by Will Ferrell and Mr. McKay; director of photography, Oliver Wood; edited by Brent White and Melissa Bretherton; music by Andrew Feltenstein and John Nau; production design by Clayton Hartley; costumes by Susan Matheson; produced by Judd Apatow, Mr. Ferrell and Mr. McKay; released by Paramount Pictures. Running time: 1 hour 59 minutes. \n \n WITH: Will Ferrell (Ron Burgundy), Steve Carell (Brick Tamland), Paul Rudd (Brian Fantana), David Koechner (Champ Kind), Christina Applegate (Veronica Corningstone), Meagan Good (Linda Jackson), James Marsden (Jack Lime), Josh Lawson (Kench Allenby), Kristen Wiig (Chani), Dylan Baker (Freddie Shapp) and Judah Nelson (Walter Burgundy). ||||| Every time I see Ron Burgundy, a.k.a. Will Ferrell, hawking Dodge Durangos on TV \u2014 which seems like a million times a day \u2014 what strikes me is how brilliant the \"Anchorman\" conceit is in small bits. The carefully manicured hair, the flashy suits, all just window dressing for that marvelously bloated ego, the absurd made irresistible in 60-second increments. \n \n That, I'd suggest, should be the recommended dosage. \n \n At nearly two hours, the nonsense of Ron and the news game, which Ferrell and co-writer and director Adam McKay skewered so effectively in 2004, is harder to sustain the second time around. \"Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues,\" does continue the legend of the original \"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy.\" \n \n PHOTOS: Billion-dollar movie club \n \n But the reality that Ron Burgundy did indeed become a legend is part of the film's difficulty. Waiting nearly a decade before the sequel came allowed time for \"Anchorman\" to reach cult status \u2014 \"stay classy\" joined the lexicon of the knowingly sarcastic. So revered is the original, the film's legions of fans have likely watched it about as many times as I've seen those Dodge ads. Between the history and the hype, expectations are high for a Burgundy redux to deliver. \n \n That presents its own set of challenges. A comedy sequel always carries the risk that the joke was stretched to the limits in the first. We did not, for example, need another slice of \"American Pie,\" anymore than we needed a \"Hangover 2\" or \"3,\" a clear case of overindulging. \n \n While I'm glad \"Anchorman\" is back \u2014 we need a little levity in this year of heavy films \u2014 I do wish it were better. With so many sight gags and nearly every living comic in the world making an appearance at some point, the entire operation, like Ron's ego, feels a bit bloated. \n \n PHOTOS: Celebrities by The Times \n \n Still, \"Anchorman 2\" has its distinct pleasures, chief among them its characters. And chief among its characters is Steve Carell. Back as the mentally challenged weathercaster Brick, his scenes are hysterically saturated with the eternal sunshine of a spotless mind. Double the fun when Kristen Wiig's socially inept Chani enters the picture. Together they create some of the strangest romantic chemistry the big screen has seen in a while \u2014 maybe ever. \n \n As the legend picks up, Ron and Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) are married with a young son named Walter (Cronkite?). The former competitors have joined forces, co-anchoring a weekend network newscast in New York. They are happy enough, but pining for prime time. \n \n A series of unfortunate events align to split up the couple \u2014 on air and off. It begins when she gets that prime-time spot and he does not \u2014 the good news/bad news delivered in a very funny cameo by Harrison Ford. Veronica's success is more than Ron can stomach so it's back to San Diego for the fallen star. \n \n PHOTOS: Greatest box office flops \n \n Besides, there had to be some excuse to send Ron on a downward spiral \u2014 wedded bliss and career satisfaction don't suit him. It also allows the filmmakers to reunite the anchorman with his former news team: correspondent Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), sportscaster Champ Kind (David Koechner) and Brick. \n \n Like an incredibly slow windup, \"Anchorman 2\" spends a lot of time getting us caught up on their lives; basically some are better off than others. These segments struggle for traction and Ron's job as an emcee at SeaWorld has drawn sharp criticism from real-world animal rights activists who see absolutely nothing funny in the captivity of killer whales (see the documentary \"Blackfish\" for a very good recap of the issues). \n \n Rescuing Ron from San Diego, and us from a dearth of the solid silly nonsense we expect from \"Anchorman,\" is the very dry Dylan Baker. As Freddie Shapp, a TV producer trying to sell Ron on the idea of a 24-hour cable news operation, you can tell if the TV gig doesn't pan out he's got a future in used cars. \n \n On the set: movies and TV \n \n With the plasticized all-news-all-the-time culture in the film's sights, the fun begins in earnest. Burgundy has a new nemesis in Jack Lime (James Marsden). Though it hardly seems possible, Lime has better hair than Ron. And he may not understand what is actually going on in the world, but he's a smooth news reader and he knows exactly when to flash that megawatt smile. Marsden is a crack-up in the role. \n \n The competition to keep up ratings and newsroom infighting provides a good setup for many of the best jokes. The birth of the slow-speed car chase during Ron's watch is a hoot. The funniest gag involves Brick, but to say more would be to spoil the fun. \n \n There are a few bizarre detours that seem contrived to allow the filmmakers to keep a gag they loved but couldn't quite figure out how to make it fit. One involves blindness and a lighthouse and is actually hilarious. But at times like this, it feels as if the concept has outrun the comedy and \"Anchorman 2\" stops making sense. \n \n betsy.sharkey@latimes.com \n \n --------------------------- \n \n 'Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues' \n \n MPAA rating: PG-13 for crude and sexual content, drug use, language and comic violence \n \n Running time: 1 hour, 59 minutes \n \n Playing: In general release ||||| CLOSE BackStage host Carly Mallenbaum reveals some of the best lines from new movie 'Anchorman 2.' \n \n Nearly anyone who is anybody in contemporary comedy \u2014 and even drama \u2014 makes an appearance in this sequel. \n \n The gang is back!

Not every scene is equally funny, of course, but most of the comic antics generate laughs. \n \n STORY: Five things creating 'a whole new world' for Ron Burgundy \n \n MORE: 'Anchorman 2' bulletin: Ron Burgundy is everywhere \n \n MORE: Meet the inspiration for Anchorman \n \n REVIEWS: The latest movie reviews from USA TODAY \n \n TRAILERS: Coming soon to theaters \n \n It's 1980 in this follow-up to the '70s-era Anchorman, and Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) is no longer the top newsman in San Diego (pronounced San De-ahh-go by the lame-brained Burgundy). He's been run out of the business and works as a SeaWorld announcer. \n \n He is, however, as inappropriate and boorish as ever, prompting a kid to yell: \"Children and animals hate you, Ron Burgundy!\" \n \n His inept former news team, dim-witted weatherman Brick Tamland (Steve Carell), inanely slick reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd) and bigoted sportscaster Champ Kind (David Koechner) also have gone on to non-journalistic pursuits. \n \n The chemistry and improvisational energy of this comic quartet fuel the comedy. They inhabit their motley crew of characters with outrageous flair. And Ferrell is spot-on as the buffoonish Burgundy. \n \n Burgundy is offered an on-air gig by a news start-up \u2014 GNN (Global News Network), the first 24-7 news organization. He rounds up his team, vowing: \"I'm gonna go do what God put Ron Burgundy on this Earth to do: have salon-quality hair and read the news.\" \n \n The mustachioed Burgundy takes an ultra-patriotic stance in his first newscast and reports upbeat news. (\"Don't just have a great night,\" he tells viewers. \"Have an American night.\") The approach quickly wins the hearts of TV watchers. \n \n Burgundy and former co-anchor Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) have married and had a son, Walter (Judah Nelson). Greg Kinnear figures into their dynamics in a comical subplot. Supporting players are absurdly funny: Kristen Wiig as a daft secretary, Meagan Good as Burgundy's tough boss and James Marsden as Burgundy's swaggering nemesis. \n \n Screenwriters Ferrell and Adam McKay, who also directs, reprise the wackier elements from the first movie. Burgundy indulges in a jazz flute solo and his canine sidekick Baxter is still on hand, lively as ever, despite the passing of the years. \n \n In the original, one of the funniest segments was a rumble between competing news teams. (The few rules to this nasty fight entail not touching the face or hair, though outright annihilation is fine.) A similar, but more elaborate, gag here is boisterously humorous. \n \n As a bonus, the comedy, produced by Judd Apatow, has an abundance of starry cameos. Clocking in at two hours, however, the movie is about 20 minutes too long and a skit involving Burgundy's temporary blindness grows tiresome. \n \n While it may not be as quotable as its predecessor, Anchorman 2 still is wacky fun. And who can resist brave little Baxter tackling yet another predator and saving the day once more? \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1bNIqkP",

The sequel brings back the absurdity of the first and even takes a few swings at satire, and while it may not equal its predecessor, critics say it's worth a watch. \"It's not unusual for comedies to sink to silly-stupid depths.

    "generated_summary": "Anchorman 2 is at its best when it abandons story contrivance in favor of comic anarchy. At times, Anchorman 2 blurs the line between depicting stupid and being stupid. It\u2019s not quite kin to Network or A Face in the Crowd; the need for easy laughs precludes genuine outrage, which in its own way can become a burden. The recent media appearances by Ron Burgundy \u2014 impersonated by Will Ferrell \u2014 have the quality of commercial art reminding us that he exists to lampoon television news. The movie is in danger of being overshadowed by its own marketing campaign, but it's still fun to see him channel a little Howard Beale when conscience comes a-calling.",

They tested for Zika and various other pathogens but hit a series of dead ends. \n \n \"We couldn't identify what was going on,\" J. Glenn Morris, director of the university's Emerging Pathogens Institute, told NPR member station WUSF. \"We screened this with all the standard approaches and it literally took a year and a half of sort of dogged laboratory work to figure out what this virus was.\" \n \n Researchers published their findings earlier this month in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases. \n \n The virus was first found in the U.S. in 1964, when researchers isolated it from mosquitoes in Keystone, Fla. Since then, it \"has been found in animal populations along coastal regions stretching from Texas to the Chesapeake Bay,\" according to a statement from University of Florida Health. \n \n But until now, there hasn't been a way to test humans for the Keystone virus, which is carried by the Aedes atlanticus mosquito, a cousin to the Zika-spreading Aedes aegypti. \n \n The virus can cause a rash and mild fever in humans. The teenager did not show signs of encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain \u2014 but Keystone is part of a group of viruses \"known to cause encephalitis in several species, including humans,\" said lead study author John Lednicky, a University of Florida research professor in the environmental and global health department of the College of Public Health and Health Professions. \n \n Morris suspects many people might have the Keystone virus. \n \n \"Although the virus has never previously been found in humans, the infection may actually be fairly common in North Florida,\" he said in the statement. \n \n \"It's one of these instances where if you don't know to look for something, you don't find it.\" ||||| A mosquito-borne illness originally found in the Tampa Bay area has been confirmed in a human for the first time, according to University of Florida researchers. \n \n The Keystone virus, named after the northwestern Hillsborough County area where it was initially identified in 1964, has been found in animal populations along coastal regions stretching from Texas to the Chesapeake Bay. \n \n UF researchers have been sequencing the virus since August 2016, when a 16-year-old boy in North Central Florida showed up to a clinic with a rash and fever during the Zika virus epidemic in Florida and the Caribbean. The report was published June 9 in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases. \n \n Because of concerns about Zika, laboratory samples were collected from the patient, but studies were negative for Zika or related viruses. \n \n But the researchers found Keystone virus when they did viral cultures from the patient samples. Although the teenager did not report symptoms of encephalitis, lab studies indicate that Keystone virus can infect brain cells, and may pose a risk for brain infections. \n \n Dr. Glenn Morris, director of the university's Emerging Pathogens Institute, said until now, there hasn't been a way to test for the virus. \n \n \"We couldn't identify what was going on,\u201d Morris said. \u201cWe screened this with all the standard approaches and it literally took a year and a half of sort of dogged laboratory work to figure out what this virus was.\u201d \n \n Morris said biotech companies are already reaching out to the institute to develop commercial tests that can be used in clinics and hospitals. \n \n Keystone is spread by aedes atlanticus, a common Florida mosquito and cousin to the mosquito, aedes aegypti, that spreads Zika. \n \n It\u2019s part of a group of viruses that are known to cause encephalitis - inflammation of the brain - in several species, including humans. Morris said they\u2019re not absolutely certain that Keystone can also cause encephalitis. \n \n Morris said although the virus has never previously been found in humans, the infection may actually be fairly common in North Florida. A 1972 article in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene reported Keystone virus antibodies in 19 to 21 percent of the people tested in the Tampa Bay region. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s a high likelihood that Keystone virus is continuing to circulate in Florida, as it has for at least 50 or 60 years, and as it may well have for hundreds of years,\u201d Morrisa said. \u201cThis is one of our native Florida viruses.\u201d \n \n \"It's likely there have continued to be a fair number of human infections. In most instances, it would appear to be asymptomatic or cause mild infection, fever and a rash.\" \n \n Morris emphasized the need for additional research into the prevalence of vector-borne diseases in the United States, and stressed the importance of minimizing the risk of mosquito bites by using mosquito repellent. ||||| The University of Florida Health Science Center - the most comprehensive academic health center in the Southeast - is dedicated to high-quality programs of education, research, patient care and public service. \n \n The UF College of Dentistry is the only public-funded dental school in Florida and is recognized as one of the top U.S. dental schools for the quality of its educational programs, oral health research enterprise and commitment to patient care and service. \n \n The College of Medicine, the largest of six colleges at the University of Florida Health Science Center, opened in 1956 with a mission to increase Florida's supply of highly qualified physicians, provide advanced health-care services to Florida residents and foster discovery in health research. \n \n Founded in 1956, the University of Florida College of Nursing is the premier educational institution for nursing in the state of Florida and is ranked in the top 10 percent of all nursing graduate programs nationwide.

    "document": "To the Editor: \n \n Re \u201cDonald Trump Gets Weirder,\u201d by Gail Collins (column, April 2): \n \n Even before Gail Collins was with The New York Times, she has written nasty and derogatory articles about me. Actually, I have great respect for Ms. Collins in that she has survived so long with so little talent. Her storytelling ability and word usage (coming from me, who has written many best sellers), is not at a very high level. More importantly, her facts are wrong! \n \n As far as her comments on the so-called \u201cbirther\u201d issue, I don't need Ms. Collins's advice. There is a very large segment of our society who believe that Barack Obama, indeed, was not born in the United States. His grandmother from Kenya stated, on tape, that he was born in Kenya and she was there to watch the birth. His family in Honolulu is fighting over which hospital in Hawaii he was born in -- they just don't know. \n \n He has not been able to produce a \u201cbirth certificate\u201d but merely a totally unsigned \u201ccertificate of live birth\u201d -- which is totally different and of very little significance. Unlike a birth certificate, a certificate of live birth is very easy to obtain. Equally of importance, there are no records in Hawaii that a Barack Hussein Obama was born there -- no bills, no doctors names, no nurses names, no registrations, no payments, etc. As far as the two notices placed in newspapers, many things could have happened, but some feel the grandparents put an ad in order to show that he was a citizen of the U.S. with all of the benefits thereto. Everybody, after all, and especially then, wanted to be a United States citizen. \n \n The term used by Ms. Collins -- \u201cbirther\u201d -- is very derogatory and is meant in a derogatory way. Had this been George Bush or almost any other President or Presidential aspirant, they would never have been allowed to attain office, or would have been thrown out of office very quickly. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n For some reason, the press protects President Obama beyond anything or anyone I have ever seen. What they don't realize is that if he was not born in the United States, they would have uncovered the greatest \"scam\" in the history of our country. In other words, they would become the hottest writer since Watergate, or beyond. \n \n Open your eyes, Gail, there's at least a good chance that Barack Hussein Obama has made mincemeat out of our great and cherished Constitution! ||||| \u201cThat first book was total genius and helped get him elected,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cBut you can tell Obama did the second book himself because it read like it was written by somebody of average intelligence with a high school education.\u201d \n \n Did I mention that, in his letter, Trump complained about my calling him a \u201cbirther\u201d because the word was \u201cvery derogatory and meant in a derogatory way\u201d? Obama, of course, graduated from Columbia University and Harvard Law School \u2014 if you can believe Columbia and Harvard Law. \n \n \u201cThree weeks ago I thought he was born in this country. Right now I have some real doubts. I have people that actually have been studying it, and they cannot believe what they\u2019re finding,\u201d Trump announced on \u201c Today .\u201d \n \n Photo \n \n Trump does not actually seem to have people studying, or even Googling. Still, he sounds very self-assured. This is because before he was a reality-show host, he was in the New York real estate business, a profession in which it is vital to be able to say imaginary things with total certainty. (\u201cI have five other people who are begging me to sell them this property. Begging.\u201d) \n \n Let\u2019s run over some of his arguments: \n \n THE GRANDMOTHER STORY \u201cHis grandmother in Kenya stated, on tape, that he was born in Kenya and she was there to watch the birth,\u201d Trump wrote. This goes back to a trans-Atlantic telephone call that was made in 2008 by Ron McRae, an Anabaptist bishop and birther, to Sarah Obama, the president\u2019s 86-year-old stepgrandmother. He asked her, through an interpreter, whether she was \u201cpresent when he was born in Kenya.\u201d The translator responded: \u201cShe says, yes, she was. She was present when Obama was born.\u201d \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

The full conversation ends with the interpreter saying, for the umpteenth time: \u201c Hawaii . She says he was born in Hawaii. In the state of Hawaii, where his father, his father was learning there. The state of Hawaii.\u201d \n \n THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE If only Hawaii made its birth records public, and charged people a thousand dollars a pop to look at them, the state\u2019s budget problems would be solved by the conspiracy theorists. However, it doesn\u2019t. If you were born in Hawaii and request a copy of your birth certificate, you get a certification of live birth, which the federal government accepts for passports. Barack Obama requested his in 2007, and his campaign posted it on the Internet. \n \n \u201cA certificate of live birth is not even signed by anybody. I saw his. I read it very carefully. It doesn\u2019t have a serial number. It doesn\u2019t have a signature,\u201d said Trump on \u201cToday.\u201d \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The document has the stamped signature of the state registrar. The University of Pennsylvania \u2019s FactCheck.org made a pilgrimage to the Obama campaign headquarters, examined the document, felt the seal, checked the serial number and reported that it looked fine. \n \n THE EMPTY PHOTO ALBUM \u201cOur current president came out of nowhere. Came out of nowhere,\u201d Trump told the Conservative Political Action Conference to great applause. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019ll go a step further. The people that went to school with him, they never saw him; they don\u2019t know who he is. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d \n \n This week on CNN, Suzanne Malveaux played Trump clips of Hawaiians reminiscing about the schoolchild Obama for a documentary the network had done on the president. \n \n \u201cLook, I didn\u2019t say that ... If he was 3 years old or 2 years old or 1 year old and people remember him, that\u2019s irrelevant,\u201d Trump responded. \u201cYou have to be born in this country.\u201d ||||| Vote for Donald Trump, the man who can make Bill O\u2019Reilly look like the most sensible guy in the room. \n \n Trump\u2019s main argument for why he should be taken seriously as a presidential contender is his business success. Has Obama ever hosted a long-running reality series? Owned a bankruptcy-bound chain of casinos? Put his name on a flock of really unattractive high-rise apartment buildings? No! \n \n \u201cBy now my name is big enough and equated with the gold standard to the extent that I don\u2019t have to say too much about it,\u201d wrote Trump in one of his books, before going on to say a lot more about it. He is extremely sensitive to any gibes about his business record, which has been up and down over the years. \n \n Photo \n \n During one down period, I referred to him in print as a \u201cfinancially embattled thousandaire\u201d and he sent me a copy of the column with my picture circled and \u201cThe Face of a Dog!\u201d written over it. \n \n Trump was one of the first people I interviewed when I came to New York as a reporter back in the \u201980s when he was a developer-wunderkind who had started in the business with nothing but a smile, a dream and his father\u2019s large holdings in real estate. \n \n He\u2019s still promoting, 24/7. Some people believe that his presidential flirtations are an attempt to draw viewers to his TV show, \u201cCelebrity Apprentice.\u201d In it, people who are alleged to be famous compete for money for their favorite charities and what one former contestant revealed was a salary of $16,000 apiece. That isn\u2019t much for network TV work, but since one of this year\u2019s celebrities, disgraced former steroid -using baseball player Jose Canseco , recently tried to make a $5,000 fee by sending his brother to impersonate him in an exhibition boxing match, you have to figure it comes in handy. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

I recently saw an episode in which a former top model had a serious discussion with a fellow competitor about whether this was the 20th century or the 21st. You can\u2019t get stuff like that on \u201c Mad Men .\u201d \n \n The series is a perfect reflection of Trump himself: an orgy of product-placement and personal aggrandizement. All the contestants, including the ones in their 70s, have to refer to their host as \u201cMr. Trump.\u201d They all somberly devote themselves to making faux commercials about whatever enterprise has coughed up cash for a major mention that week. Then it\u2019s off to the boardroom where people talk ceaselessly about their performance in order to stretch the whole enterprise into a low-cost, two-hour show. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n When you think about it, \u201cCelebrity Apprentice\u201d has a lot in common with the current Republican presidential campaign. Endless blathering. Strange contenders who did something vaguely notable in 1986. And Donald Trump, looking extremely cheerful. \n \n Beyond having the moral fortitude to tell Dionne Warwick she is fired, Trump\u2019s qualifications for being president of the United States include having co-written a large number of books, including \u201cThink Big and Kick Ass\u201d (\u201cPeople always ask me: \u2018How did you get so rich?\u2019 \u201d) and \u201c Never Give Up .\u201d (\u201cThis book is about a subject near and dear to my heart \u2014 never giving up.\u201d) \n \n To establish his birther creds, this week Trump produced his own birth certificate, after one failed attempt in which he came up with a document that was too weak to qualify for a passport. By the time he worked things out, we had an entire news cycle devoted to Donald Trump having been born in New York.",

Seems the Donald responded to Collins' column, which tweaked him as a loopy birther, with a letter to the editor tweaking her in turn as a no-good hack for writing \"nasty and derogatory articles about me.\" \"Actually,\" Trump writes, \"I have great respect for Ms. Collins in that she has survived so long with so little talent. Her storytelling ability and word usage (coming from me, who has written many bestsellers), is not at a very high level.\" Snap! This week, Collins slaps back, noting that the bestselling author himself once sent her an \"aggrieved message ... in which he misspelled the word 'too.'\u201d Further, she runs down his birther allegations, dismissing his doubts about President Obama's birth certificate, his grandmother, and his authorship of Dreams From My Father as all but absurd. \"Recent polls have shown Trump running second among potential Republican primary voters,\" Collins concludes. \"I believe this is not so much an indication of popularity as a desperate plea to be delivered from Mitt Romney.\"",

    "document": "In June 1962, three inmates shimmied through a hole they\u2019d chiseled into the walls of Alcatraz prison and climbed up to the roof. To mask their escape, they\u2019d placed in their bunks realistic-looking dummy heads they\u2019d made out of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 and human hair from the prison barber shop. The three men \u2014 brothers John and Clarence Anglin and fellow inmate Frank Morris \u2014 grabbed makeshift paddles and plunged an escape raft they made of stolen raincoats into the dark waters of San Francisco Bay. \n \n Alcatraz officials have long stated that the men drowned, maintaining the prison\u2019s bragging rights of no escapees. But now, more than 50 years later, new leads are being presented by the Anglin family, who are cooperating with authorities for the first time. \n \n They claim that not only did the brothers survive the escape, they were alive and well up through at least the mid-1970s \u2014 and may still be alive today. \n \n The evidence is offered up by the Anglins\u2019 nephews David, 48, and Ken Widner, 54, who are featured in \u201cAlcatraz: Search for the Truth,\u201d a History Channel special airing Monday. \n \n The evidence has pumped life into the cold case, and has investigators lining up new interviews and planning to search South America for signs of America\u2019s most notorious escapees. \n \n \u201cThis is absolutely the best actionable lead we\u2019ve had,\u201d Art Roderick, the retired US marshal who was lead investigator on the case for 20 years, tells The Post. \n \n The Anglin family sat on those leads for years because, they say, they were spied on and harassed by the FBI for years. But a desire to see the case solved before Marie Anglin Widner \u2014 the Widners\u2019 mother and the escapees\u2019 sister \u2014 passed away, combined with the cockiness of Alcatraz officials, inspired them to come forward. \n \n \u201c[Alcatraz officials] were not willing to . . . say, \u2018Maybe [the escapees] did make it,\u2019 \u201d David Widner says. \u201cThat gave me the motive to prove them wrong.\u201d \n \n First there were the Christmas cards, signed with Clarence and John Anglin\u2019s names, that were delivered to their mother during the three years after the escape. They arrived without postage. \n \n In the History Channel special, the nephews take the cards and other evidence to Roderick, who retired in 2008 but is still working on the case. Though the handwriting matched, the investigators were unable to pinpoint the exact date of the cards. \n \n But the nephews also came forward with a photo \u2014 which will be revealed on the show \u2014 that proves the Anglins may have been alive in the 1970s. That really caught Roderick\u2019s attention. \n \n \u201cWhen you work these types of cases, there\u2019s a feeling you get when stuff starts to fall into place,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m getting this feeling now.\u201d \n \n The next big piece of evidence was buried \u2014 about six feet in the ground. The family finally let investigators dig up the remains of the Anglins\u2019 other brother, Alfred, who was electrocuted during his own escape attempt from an Alabama prison. They needed his DNA: Authorities had discovered a set of bones that washed ashore north of San Francisco in 1963, which they said may have belonged to one of the escapees. \n \n But the DNA proved to not be a match, bolstering the Anglin family\u2019s claims that the two may indeed still be alive. (The bones could still belong to Morris, though; he has no living relatives to test.) \n \n David Widner says he\u2019s working on a book that will contain more evidence not included in the TV show. That includes a surprise guest star: Boston crime boss Whitey Bulger, who met the future escapees in Alcatraz. Bulger, in a 2014 letter to Ken Widner, said he instructed John and Clarence on how to navigate bay currents, and dropped a key piece of advice about being a fugitive. \n \n \u201cHe taught them that when you disappear, you have to cut all ties,\u201d Ken says. \u201cHe told me in a letter, \u2018This is the mistake that I made.\u2019 He told me, \u2018These brothers undoubtedly had done exactly what I told them to do.\u2019 \u201d \n \n The nephews hope the special rewrites the history of Alcatraz, and cements their uncles and Morris as the only people to successfully escape the island, out of the 36 who tried. \n \n Roderick has lined up 10 new interviews since seeing the evidence, and is talking to US marshals about investigating in Brazil, where the Anglins may have ended up. If they are still alive (both would be in their mid-80s by now), international laws may not even allow extradition to the US. \n \n Nonetheless, Roderick would want to sit down with them to figure out how they did it. \n \n If they died and their bodies can be found, however, Ken and David want to bring the Anglin brothers back to the family plot in Ruskin, Fla. \n \n Says David, \u201cWe should get \u2019em a place ready.\u201d ||||| Those caught up in the romance surrounding Alcatraz might be tempted to watch \u201cAlcatraz: Search For the Truth,\u201d a History documentary devoted to the 1962 escape by Frank Morris and brothers John and Clarence Anglin. The curious, however, would be well advised to tape this tedious production and fast-forward to the last six minutes, which contain everything they could hope to glean about whether the trio, never found, might have survived the treacherous waters surrounding the prison island. Even allowing for the genre\u2019s carnival-barker qualities, the producers have spread about 25 minutes of content over two hours. \n \n Told entirely from the perspective of the Anglins (that is, the guys who Clint Eastwood didn\u2019t play in the 1979 movie \u201cEscape From Alcatraz\u201d), the special is built around information provided by their nephews, Ken and David Widner, two emotional fellows who are convinced the government has been after the family and that their uncles have been abused by the media. So they enlist a retired U.S. Marshal, Art Roderick, to help lay out their case, which includes various shreds of evidence that they believe prove the Anglins not only navigated the frigid waters but also made it to South America. \n \n Graciously setting aside what the \u201cSearch\u201d reveals \u2013 with the Widners having begun expressing their belief the Anglins survived a few years ago \u2013 there\u2019s no nice way to say that the brothers are an irritating pair, carrying rather sizable chips on their shoulders. Claiming the FBI harassed them, and that their only motivation is to set the record straight, they\u2019re prone to getting teary-eyed when speaking about these half-century-old events, including their conviction that the feds killed another uncle while seeking information about the escapees. \n \n Nor does it help that almost everything here feels overproduced, from the pounding music to the dramatic recreations. So when one of the Widners reminisces about his mom receiving a phone call when he was a child, voila, there\u2019s a gauzy image of a woman holding a tyke as she answers. \n \n Morris, whose genius IQ was thought to have been instrumental in planning the dramatic escape, is shortchanged by this version of history, which focuses squarely on the Anglins. Yet while some of the new details certainly appear intriguing, wading through the padding feels like treading water, or maybe crawling down that sewage tunnel at the end of \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption.\u201d All that, and there\u2019s still relatively little presented about the rich lore of Alcatraz \u2013 which has inspired plenty of fiction \u2013 other than a rather mundane visit to the island. \n \n Granted, History\u2019s pursuit of younger demos with programs like \u201cPawn Stars\u201d deviates so often from actual history that it\u2019s kind of nice when the two occasionally bump into each other. Yet watching \u201cAlcatraz,\u201d those prone to lament the channel\u2019s drift will likely just remember why their search for quality historical fare increasingly leads elsewhere.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Three inmates who famously escaped from Alcatraz prison in 1962 may not be so dead after all. In fact, new evidence that they survived has spawned a History Channel special and inspired a retired US marshal to revive the investigation, the New York Post reports. \"This is absolutely the best actionable lead we\u2019ve had,\" says the ex-marshal, Art Roderick. To recap, three Alcatraz inmates\u2014Frank Morris along with brothers John and Clarence Anglin\u2014escaped by chiseling a hole into a prison wall and jumping into the cold San Francisco Bay, with homemade paddles and a raft made from raincoats. Never found, they were presumed dead. But two nephews of the Anglins have produced evidence to the contrary: They have Christmas cards signed in the names of John and Clarence Anglin, and Roderick matched the handwriting. But the cards are neither stamped nor dated. A photo that will be seen on the show, Alcatraz: Search for the Truth, \"proves the Anglins may have been alive in the 1970s,\" says the Post. And DNA from the dug-up remains of another Anglin brother, Alfred, does not genetically match a set of bones found on a shore near San Francisco in 1963. In a letter, former Boston mobster Whitey Bulger says he met the three men in Alcatraz and gave them advice about navigating currents in the bay. \"He taught them that when you disappear, you have to cut all ties,\" says one of the nephews, Ken Widner. \"He told me, 'These brothers undoubtedly had done exactly what I told them to do.'\" Sadly, Variety didn't think much of the History Channel special, calling it \"overproduced, from the pounding music to the dramatic recreations.\" (A study found that the inmates might have survived if they plunged into the water between 11pm and midnight.)",

    "document": "Emmanuel Dunand/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images \n \n LONDON \u2014 Christine Lagarde, the International Monetary Fund chief, has succeeded in generating some rare unanimity in crisis-hit Greece with remarks in which she described the Greeks as tax-dodgers. \n \n \u201cInsulting,\u201d said Evangelos Venizelos, the Socialist leader, in response to an interview Ms. Lagarde gave to The Guardian, a British newspaper. \u201cGreek workers pay their taxes, which are unbearable,\u201d said Alexis Tsipras of the far-left Syriza party. \n \n As of Monday, more than 19,000 comments had been posted on Ms. Lagarde\u2019s Facebook page, many from Greeks and most uncomplimentary. \n \n The controversy also spilled over to her native France, where Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, the government spokeswoman, described Ms. Lagarde\u2019s view of the Greeks as \u201ca bit of a caricature.\u201d \n \n Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, of France\u2019s left-wing Front de Gauche, suggested she should quit and demanded to know what right she had to make \u201cunworthy\u201d comments about the Greeks. \n \n In the offending interview, published Saturday, the I.M.F. boss appeared to place the blame firmly on the Greeks for their present economic mess and suggested \u201call these people in Greece who are trying to escape tax\u201d should help themselves collectively by paying it. \n \n In the furor that followed, Ms. Lagarde issued a statement expressing sympathy for the Greeks and the challenges they were facing. That was why the I.M.F. was supporting Greece\u2019s efforts to overcome its economic crisis, she said. \n \n She tempered her original point by adding: \u201cAn important part of this effort is that everyone should carry their fair share of the burden, especially the most privileged and especially in terms of paying their taxes.\u201d \n \n While Ms. Lagarde\u2019s Facebook page was overwhelmed with comments, some Greeks set up a rival page to channel the national outrage. Commentary on social media accused Ms. Lagarde of preaching to poor Greeks from the position of a highly paid \u2014 and untaxed \u2014 international bureaucrat. \n \n That came with advice to stay out of Greece: \n \n M/s Lagarde would be well advised never to step foot on Greek soil \u2014 unless of course she can withstand the wrath of the Greek people ! \u2014 Taking On Banks (@bankcustomers) May 28, 2012 \n \n Bill Mitchell, an Australian economist, wrote in his blog on Monday that her remarks fit into a pattern of bullying by international institutions as Greece headed for a new round of elections next month. \n \n The Guardian itself challenged Ms. Lagarde\u2019s views in a follow-up editorial suggesting that, as French finance minister at the end of the boom years, she was partly responsible for Europe\u2019s current financial plight. \n \n \u201cNot only should Christine Lagarde know better, she does know better,\u201d the newspaper said. \n \n Criticizing her for placing the blame on spendthrift southern European nations, it said: \u201cImprudent borrowers require foolhardy lenders, and in Greece and elsewhere that role has often been played by northern European banks.\u201d ||||| The International Monetary Fund has ratcheted up the pressure on crisis-hit Greece after its managing director, Christine Lagarde, said she has more sympathy for children deprived of decent schooling in sub-Saharan Africa than for many of those facing poverty in Athens. \n \n In an uncompromising interview with the Guardian, Lagarde insists it is payback time for Greece and makes it clear that the IMF has no intention of softening the terms of the country's austerity package. \n \n Using some of the bluntest language of the two-and-a-half-year debt crisis, she says Greek parents have to take responsibility if their children are being affected by spending cuts. \"Parents have to pay their tax,\" she says. \n \n Greece, which has seen its economy shrink by a fifth since the recession began, has been told to cut wages, pensions and public spending in return for financial help from the IMF, the European Union and the European Central Bank. \n \n Asked whether she is able to block out of her mind the mothers unable to get access to midwives or patients unable to obtain life-saving drugs, Lagarde replies: \"I think more of the little kids from a school in a little village in Niger who get teaching two hours a day, sharing one chair for three of them, and who are very keen to get an education. I have them in my mind all the time. Because I think they need even more help than the people in Athens.\" \n \n Lagarde, predicting that the debt crisis has yet to run its course, adds: \"Do you know what? As far as Athens is concerned, I also think about all those people who are trying to escape tax all the time. All these people in Greece who are trying to escape tax.\" She says she thinks \"equally\" about Greeks deprived of public services and Greek citizens not paying their tax. \n \n \"I think they should also help themselves collectively.\" Asked how, she replies: \"By all paying their tax.\" \n \n Asked if she is essentially saying to the Greeks and others in Europe that they have had a nice time and it is now payback time, she responds: \"That's right.\" \n \n The intervention by Lagarde comes after the caretaker Greek government met to discuss a sharp fall in tax revenues \u2013 down by a third in a year. Under the terms of the country's bailout, Athens has agreed to improve Greece's poor record for tax collection in order to reduce its budget deficit, and Lagarde's remarks are evidence of a growing impatience in the international community. Reports surfaced in Germany and France of preparations being made to cope with Greece's possible departure from the single currency after its election on 17 June. \n \n Belgium's deputy prime minister, Didier Reynders, said it would be a \"serious professional error\" if central banks and companies did not prepare for an exit. \n \n The euro came under fresh attack on the foreign exchanges, dropping below \u20ac1.25 at one point on Friday, as the Spanish government was in talks to pump up to \u20ac19bn of rescue finance into Bankia, one of the country's biggest banks, and the Catalan regional government sought financial help from Madrid to deal with its debts. \n \n Signs emerged of a widening gulf between Germany and France over whether common eurobonds should be issued to help those countries, such as Greece and Spain, with high interest rates on their debt. \n \n Jens Weidmann, president of the Bundesbank, poured cold water on the idea \u2013 which is strongly backed by the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande \u2013 and also said financial aid to Greece should be cut off if it failed to keep to the bailout deal. \n \n J\u00fcrgen Fitschen, joint head of Germany's biggest bank, Deutsche, described Greece as \"a failed state \u2026 a corrupt state\". Separately, however, there were reports suggesting that the chancellor, Angela Merkel, was dusting down the economic modernisation plan used to revive East Germany after the fall of communism in the belief that similar measures could be applied to Greece and other struggling eurozone countries. Today's Der Spiegel magazine says Merkel will present a six-point plan based on the East German blueprint as a growth strategy. It includes measures such as privatisation, looser employment law and lower tax rates. \n \n Opinion polls are pointing to a close race between parties backing and opposing the terms of Greece's \u20ac130bn bailout, but neither Germany nor the IMF has demonstrated any willingness to water down Greece's austerity programme. \n \n In her interview Lagarde says Greece is not getting softer treatment than a poor country in the developing world, and that the IMF does not find it harder to impose strong conditions on a rich nation. \n \n \"No, it's not harder. No. Because it's the mission of the fund, and it's my job to say the truth, whoever it is across the table. And I tell you something: it's sometimes harder to tell the government of low-income countries, where people live on $3,000, $4,000 or $5,000 per capita per year, to actually strengthen the budget and reduce the deficit. Because I know what it means in terms of welfare programmes and support for the poor. It has much bigger ramifications.\" ||||| Christine Lagarde, the IMF boss who caused international outrage after she suggested in an interview with the Guardian on Friday that beleaguered Greeks might do well to pay their taxes, pays no taxes, it has emerged. \n \n As an official of an international institution, her salary of $467,940 (\u00a3298,675) a year plus $83,760 additional allowance a year is not subject to any taxes. \n \n The former French finance minister took over as managing director of the IMF last year when she succeeded her disgraced compatriot Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who was forced to resign after he faced charges \u2013 later dropped \u2013 of sexually attacking a New York hotel maid. \n \n Lagarde, 56, receives a pay and benefits package worth more than American president Barack Obama earns from the United States government, and he pays taxes on it. \n \n The same applies to nearly all United Nations employees \u2013 article 34 of the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations of 1961, which has been signed by 187 states, declares: \"A diplomatic agent shall be exempt from all dues and taxes, personal or real, national, regional or municipal.\" \n \n According to Lagarde's contract she is also entitled to a pay rise on 1 July every year during her five-year contract. \n \n Base salaries range from $46,000 to $80,521. Senior salaries range between $95,394 and $123,033 but these are topped up with adjustments for the cost of living in different countries. A UN worker based in Geneva, for example, will see their base salary increased by 106%, in Bonn by 50.6%, Paris 62% and Peshawar 38.6%. Even in Juba, the capital of South Sudan, one of the poorest areas of the world, a UN employee's salary will be increased by 53.2%. \n \n Other benefits include rent subsidies, dependency allowances for spouses and children, education grants for school-age children and travel and shipping expenses, as well as subsidised medical insurance. \n \n For many years critics have complained that IMF, World Bank, and United Nations employees are able to live large at international taxpayers' expense. \n \n During the 1944 economic conference at Bretton Woods, where the IMF was created, American and British politicians disagreed over salaries for the bureaucrats. British delegates, including the economist John Maynard Keynes, considered the American proposals for salaries to be \"monstrous\", but lost the argument. \n \n Officials from the various organisations have long maintained that the high salaries are a way of attracting talent from the private sector. In fact, most senior employees are recruited from government posts.",

After getting bombarded by critics on Facebook, Lagarde walked back the criticism a bit, notes the New York Times. But today, the Guardian follows up with more fodder for her critics: LaGarde has to pay no taxes at all on her own $468,000 salary. \"I suppose we can have a discussion about why international organization employees shouldn\u2019t pay taxes,\" writes David Dayen at Firedog Lake. \"But the bigger issue is that Lagarde surely knew at the time of making comments about evil tax evaders that she paid no tax on her salary. This reeks of the attitude of one system for the little people, and one for the elites, which characterizes elite discourse in this day and age.\"",

    "document": "Dr. William Strampel, the former boss of Larry Nassar at Michigan State University, has been arrested. \n \n Strampel, 70, is listed as an inmate in Ingham County jail, according to an inmate search on the county's website. No charges are listed. MSU spokeswoman Emily Gerkin Guerrant confirmed Strampel had been arrested, but could provide no other details. Michigan State Police directed calls to the attorney general's office, where a spokesperson did not confirm the arrest. \n \n Strampel, the former dean of the MSU's College of Osteopathic Medicine, is facing revocation of his tenure by interim MSU President John Engler, the first step in terminating his employment. The move is in response to Strampel's failure to monitor and enforce clinical practice guidelines put in place for Nassar following a 2014 sexual harassment investigation. \n \n His arrest comes the day before a press conference from Bill Forsyth, an investigator hired by Michigan's Attorney General Bill Schuette to investigate MSU's handling of the Nassar scandal. \n \n Nassar, a prominent sports medicine doctor at the university, is in prison for possession of child pornography charges and was sentenced on charges that he sexually assaulted multiple women, often under the guise of medical treatment. More than 150 women and girls, including Olympic gymnasts, spoke at Nassar's sentencing hearings in Ingham and Eaton counties, saying he sexually assaulted them - the vast majority patients. \n \n Larry Nassar sentenced to 40 to 175 years for sexually assaulting patients \n \n Many said they had told coaches, trainers and even police about the assaults, but nothing was done. \n \n It was Strampel who, after a 2014 Title IX complaint and police report lodged by Amanda Thomashow, sent an email putting Nassar back to work with a series of conditions, including having another person in the room when he was performing procedures in sensitive areas and using gloves. \n \n According to statements from Nassar's more direct supervisors in a March 2017 police report, Strampel did not make Nassar's colleagues aware of the conditions. \n \n After Strampel put Nassar back in place, 20 more women say they were molested by him. \n \n In all the university employed Nassar for almost two years while he was under investigation by other authorities. ||||| The former boss of convicted sexual abuser Larry Nassar was arrested Monday in Michigan. \n \n William Strampel, who served as the dean of Michigan State's osteopathic medical school for most of Nassar's time with the university, was listed as an inmate at Ingham County Jail on Monday night. No specific charges were posted Monday night, and a message left with a spokesman for the state police was not immediately returned. \n \n Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette has scheduled a news conference for Tuesday afternoon. \n \n Attorney John C. Manly, who represents more than 150 survivors of Nassar's abuse, issued a statement Monday. \n \n \"Our clients are encouraged by the Attorney General's action today,\" Manly said in the statement. \"It demonstrates that he is serious about investigating the systemic misconduct at MSU that led to the largest child sex abuse scandal in history and holding the responsible parties accountable.\" \n \n ESPN has obtained copies of former university-conducted performance reviews for Strampel during his time as Michigan State's dean that contained several complaints about his habit of making inappropriate remarks of a sexual nature in professional settings. The reviews include surveys in which respondents paint a picture of Strampel as a capable fundraiser and decisive administrator, but someone who \"rules with fear\" and regularly interjected sexual innuendo and comments about the appearance of women into conversations with students and co-workers. \n \n According to one respondent, Strampel's discussions about his own sexual history and inappropriate comments were \"well known and bring down the respect and reputation of the Osteopathic college. I do not think this is a new issue, instead I think it is something that the College has chosen to ignore, for what reason I dare not imagine and cannot fathom.\" \n \n Strampel was a focal point for the attorney general's ongoing investigation into whether any other individuals who worked at Michigan State should be held accountable for allowing Nassar to sexually abuse his patients for nearly two decades as a doctor on the university's campus. Strampel stepped down from his role as dean last December citing medical problems. The university took initial steps in February to have him fired, a process that can take several months or longer. \n \n \"Interim President John Engler has felt like this is someone who doesn't carry forth the values of the university going forward, and this conduct is not going to be tolerated,\" university spokeswoman Emily Guerrant said Monday night. \n \n Nassar pleaded guilty to state charges of first-degree criminal sexual conduct as well as federal child pornography charges. He admitted in court that he used his position as a prominent doctor at Michigan State and within the USA Gymnastics organization to abuse women who came to see him for injuries. Nassar is serving a 60-year sentence for his federal crimes and was sentenced to up to 175 years in state prison for the sexual assault crimes. \n \n Strampel came to Michigan State in the late 1990s and was promoted to his position as dean in 2002. He told police last spring that he had little or no interaction with Nassar before 2014, when a recently graduated student lodged a complaint that Nassar touched her inappropriately during an appointment at the MSU Sports Medicine clinic. \n \n That complaint, filed by Amanda Thomashow, led to an investigation into Nassar's conduct by university police and the school's Title IX department. Michigan State's Title IX office cleared Nassar of wrongdoing in the summer of 2014, telling Thomashow that she didn't understand the \"nuanced difference\" between sexual assault and a legitimate medical procedure. The panel of four experts that helped the office reach that conclusion included Nassar's colleagues and one woman described as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and close friend. \n \n Strampel told police that he believed the Title IX decision showed Nassar was \"cleared of all charges,\" so he allowed him to resume seeing patients on Michigan State's campus in late July 2014. Nassar remained under police investigation for the same incident until December 2015. Several women say they were abused by Nassar during that time frame. \n \n When he returned to the clinic in 2014, Nassar and Strampel agreed to a new set of guidelines to use when he was treating patients in sensitive areas. The guidelines included that Nassar should explain fully what he was doing before touching patients near their genitalia or other private areas, that he should avoid skin-to-skin contact whenever possible, and that a chaperone should be present during any such treatment. \n \n Strampel told police he didn't think it was necessary to follow up to make sure Nassar was following the protocol, and he did not inform other employees at the clinic about the new rules. Strampel fired Nassar in September 2016 when he learned that Nassar had been ignoring those guidelines for two years. More than a dozen women and girls say they were abused during that time. \n \n The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Strampel told a group of medical school students in 2016 that he did not believe the accusations against Nassar. In a written statement obtained by ESPN, one of the students present at that meeting said Strampel told the students -- who were there to discuss a separate sexual assault issue concerning their classmates -- that he did not want to fire Nassar, but felt he had no choice. \n \n Several survivors of Nassar's abuse have criticized Strampel for what they say was a flippant and insensitive response to more accusations against Nassar in 2016. Less than a month before Nassar was fired, Rachael Denhollander filed a police report alleging that the former doctor abused her. She also spoke to reporters from the Indianapolis Star for a story that would make her the first woman to publicly accuse Nassar of sexual assault. \n \n Nassar alerted Strampel that reporters wanted to speak with him about the story. Strampel wished him luck and in an email told him, \"I am on your side.\" After the article was published, Strampel shared it with others at Michigan State, referring to Denhollander's claims as \"the cherry on the cake of my day.\" \n \n \"Is this the right way to handle disclosures of abuse on MSU's campus?\" Denhollander asked during an impact statement she delivered in court last month. \n \n The attorney general's office requested Strampel's work cellphone, computer and calendars among other documents, shortly after beginning its investigation of the university two months ago. Strampel is also a co-defendant in dozens of civil lawsuits related to Nassar's abuse. Strampel's attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but have previously declined requests for comment about his actions, saying that the firm does not comment on ongoing civil litigation.",

Though Strampel became dean in 2002, he says his only true interaction with Nassar began after a complaint was lodged against the doctor in 2014. No wrongdoing was uncovered by Michigan State's Title IX office, and so Strampel reinstated Nassar so long as he followed a new protocol that included stipulations like having a chaperone present during any treatment that occurred near a young patient's genitalia. Strampel says he did not verify Nassar was adhering to the rules, and fired him in 2016 after learning he wasn't. MLive reports 20 women accused Nassar of abusing them during that period.",

(Associated Press) \n \n Miami-Dade County Judge William Altfield said two of the five unreleased video clips depict the singer's genitalia during a urine test for drugs at the Miami Beach Police Department. Altfield agreed with lawyers for Bieber, who turned 20 on Saturday, that the video's airing would be an invasion of privacy that outweighed the public's right to know. \n \n \"Mr. Bieber's right to privacy is paramount,\" the judge said. \"He has not lost his right to privacy, and that is what is important here.\" \n \n Attorneys for The Associated Press and other news outlets had previously suggested any sensitive portions be blacked out and the rest released under Florida's liberal open records laws. Much of the footage was released last week, some of it showing Bieber walking unsteadily during a sobriety test. \n \n Bieber has pleaded not guilty to charges of driving under the influence, resisting arrest and driving with an expired license. He and R&B singer Khalil Amir Sharieff were arrested early on Jan. 23 during what police called an illegal street drag race between a Lamborghini and a Ferrari. Neither has been charged with drag racing. \n \n Bieber attorney Roy Black said he was satisfied with the ruling, as did media attorneys. AP attorney Deanna Shullman said the news organization would never show Bieber's private parts and Scott Ponce, representing The Miami Herald and CBS television stations, said the ruling was more about protecting the singer from random releases on the Internet. \n \n \"It's more about what someone in the private sector might do,\" Ponce said. \n \n Black said the three clips to be released without redaction are shot from an angle that is too far away to discern what is going on. Prosecutors said they will release all five remaining clips in a few days, after the court-ordered redactions are completed. \n \n Separately, the Miami Beach Police Department made public a new batch of 18 still photos taken shortly after Bieber's arrest, mainly close-ups of his many tattoos \u2014 a praying Jesus, a grinning joker's face accompanied by the word \"love,\" an Indian chief's head, a Psalms quotation, and more \u2014 and one full-length picture of the singer. \n \n Evidence released previously showed that a breath test found Bieber's blood-alcohol level below the .02 threshold considered intoxicated for underage drivers. The urine test found the presence of the active ingredient in marijuana and the antianxiety drug Xanax. Bieber told officers he had been smoking marijuana before his arrest, according to police reports. \n \n A trial date has not been set.

(REUTERS/Joshua Roberts) \n \n The government is seeking to ban smoking in all of the nation\u2019s 1.2 million public housing units, the latest step in a decades-long crackdown on tobacco products that help kill hundreds of thousands of Americans each year. \n \n In its proposed rule, announced Thursday, the Department of Housing and Urban Development would require more than 3,100 public housing agencies to go smoke-free within several years. The agencies must design policies prohibiting lit tobacco products in all living units, indoor common areas, administrative offices and in all outdoor areas near housing and administrative office buildings, HUD officials said. \n \n \u201cWe have a responsibility to protect public housing residents from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke, especially the elderly and children who suffer from asthma and other respiratory diseases,\u201d HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro said in a statement announcing the measure. \u201cThis proposed rule will help improve the health of more than 760,000 children and help public housing agencies save $153 million every year in healthcare, repairs and preventable fires.\u201d \n \n Though HUD will not design a final rule until after it hears public comments over the next two months, there seems little doubt that the government is headed toward the smoking ban, since the Obama administration is already moving in that direction. Since HUD strongly encouraged public housing agencies to design anti-smoking policies in 2009, more than 600 have done so. That means that more than 228,000 of the nation\u2019s public housing units are already smoke-free. \n \n [Banning smoking in subsidized housing could save millions} \n \n The latest move escalates even further the anti-smoking crackdown that has unfolded in the five decades since the U.S. surgeon general first linked cigarette smoking to deadly diseases such as lung cancer and heart disease. The campaign has seen some successes: cigarette smoking among adults has been cut more than in half from its 42 percent rate in 1965, and the United States now has more former smokers than current ones. \n \n But cigarette smoking still kills 480,000 Americans each year, making it the leading preventable cause of death in the United States, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Officials primarily cited that health data in justifying the proposed public housing smoking ban, noting especially the risks to children and the elderly people who live in more than 500,000 public housing units. \n \n \u201cEveryone \u2013 no matter where they live \u2013 deserves a chance to grow up in a healthy, smoke-free home,\u201d said U.S. Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy. \u201cThere is no safe level of secondhand smoke. So, when 58 million Americans \u2013 including 15 million children \u2013 are exposed to secondhand smoke, we have an obligation to act.\u201d \n \n Anti-smoking and health groups on Thursday hailed the proposal. \u201cSecretary Castro has taken an important step to improve public health by eliminating exposure to secondhand smoke and creating an environment that discourages smoking in public housing units,\u201d said Chris Hansen, president of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. \n \n American Heart Association CEO Nancy Brown said the move would \u201cclear the air in public housing where children and the elderly are especially vulnerable to tobacco smoke exposure. No level of secondhand smoke is safe, and tobacco in any form is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease.\u2019\u2019 \n \n But housing authority officials and lawyers, while generally supporting the government\u2019s move, raised a series of concerns, including whether some residents will resist the smoking ban and how it will be enforced. \u201cObviously, there is a clear public health issue,\u2019\u2019 said Amy M. Glassman, who is of counsel at Ballard Spahr in Washington and represents public housing authorities. \u201cBut especially when you\u2019re talking about banning smoking within their housing unit, folks take that as an issue of personal space and freedom, \u2018You\u2019re telling me what to do within the confines of my own home.\u2019 That\u2019s the main pushback issue.\u2019\u2019 \n \n In New York City, home to the country\u2019s largest population of public housing tenants, Housing Authority Chairwoman Shola Olatoye said, \u201cThe dangers of second-hand smoke have been clearly documented.\u201d The authority bans smoking in public areas, but not in private apartments. The success of the new ban will depend on \u201cpeer support and accountability,\u201d she said. \n \n A 2012 survey of public housing residents showed a smoking rate of 14 percent, in line with the 13.9 percent rate in the city as a whole. \n \n Olatoye said it was unclear how the ban would be enforced, in part because \u201cwe\u2019re at our lowest staffing levels in many years.\u201d She said it likely the housing authority will designate an area where residents can smoke, although officials have not decided whether it would be inside or outside. \n \n \u201cReasonable accommodations [for smokers] are going to have to be made,\u201d she said. \n \n Timothy Kaiser, executive director of the Public Housing Authorities Directors Association, which represents 1,900 housing authorities, said the smoking ban \u201caddresses an important health issue.\u201d But he said local housing authorities have higher-priority concerns, like a shrinking budget for operating expenses and massive cuts to capital spending that\u2019s resulted in a loss of 10,000 apartments a year to decaying conditions. \n \n \u201cYour average executive director is trying to figure out how to keep the light on and the doors open and operating in the next three to five years,\u201d Kaiser said in an interview. \n \n He said housing officials also are concerned that the smoking ban will create hardships for elderly and disabled tenants, many of whom light up in their apartments. \u201cWe have elderly residents who are addicted to nicotine,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will have a very difficult time. They may not be all that ambulatory. They\u2019ll need adjustments to the new rules.\u201d \n \n The surgeon general\u2019s office, which famously first called attention to smoking\u2019s health dangers in 1964, has continued that campaign into the digital era. In a report release last year, then-Acting Surgeon General Boris D.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 HUD proposed a federal mandate Thursday that has some smokers fuming: a ban against lighting up in public housing nationwide, the New York Times reports. If the law passes, more than 3,100 public housing agencies would prohibit smoking in all living units, indoor common areas, administrative offices, and outdoor spaces near those other areas, the Washington Post notes. The reason: to keep residents safe from secondhand smoke, cut down on fire risks, and curb building maintenance expenses, per the Times. \"The argument about secondhand smoke is over,\" HUD Secretary Julian Castro tells the paper. \"It's harmful.\" Since HUD started encouraging public housing groups to implement bans in 2009, more than 600 agencies with at least 228,000 units have gone smoke-free, per the Post\u2014but now the federal housing department wants to make it universal. A study by the CDC backs up the economics, predicting that a nationwide ban would result in annual savings of $153 million. The group that would feel the biggest burn: the NYC Housing Agency, the nation's largest public-housing group, with more than 400,000 residents in about 178,000 apartments, per the Times. But some worry that, without community support, it will be difficult to enforce, and they don't think the cops should be involved. \"It should be resident-led,\" the chairwoman of the NYCHA tells the Times. HUD says it will listen to public comments on the potential law before making a final decision.",

And I knew I was going to be OK,\" said the former Cosby Show star. \n \n Granting an interview to The Hollywood Reporter on Thursday, exactly one week after a story about Owens working as a cashier in a New Jersey Trader Joe's appeared in The Daily Mail, the actor called the entire experience a \"blessing,\" albeit a painful one. \n \n \"I don't want to be presumptuous and say because of my situation, we've started a change, but I think it is certainly less shameful to admit that we are all working people who do what we need to do,\" said the 57-year-old Owens, whose shaming incited a massive backlash toward those who took his picture and the few outlets that ran with the gossip. \n \n \"It was mean-spirited,\" he told THR. \"I am a very private person, but I chose this life, so I accepted it. I didn't feel any impulse to lash out, but I was devastated. Fortunately, that didn't last very long when all the support came in.\" \n \n And now, the jobs offers are also rolling in. Owens revealed that, even though he made it clear in previous interviews he was not looking for a handout just because of the situation, he has been offered, and is mulling over, a \"whole handful\" of television offers. \"It's been a real generosity of spirit and a generosity of action where that is concerned,\" he said. \n \n Owens said he knew the gossip piece was coming when he was contacted by the reporter a few days before it was published. So, he texted his son, talked to his wife, quit his job at Trader Joe's (\"I felt like I had to leave the store\") and prepared for the fallout. \n \n \"I imagined the worst-case scenario to brace myself, and it somehow managed to be worse than I expected,\" he said. \"The pictures of me, the words that were used to describe me, were so demeaning. It was humiliating, acutely, for a very short time \u2014 and then there was this amazing rescue from the world.\" \n \n Social media came alive with outrage when the gossip was posted. Stars immediately came to Owens' defense, many sharing their own stories of less-than-glamorous jobs they did between scripts to make ends meet. Others, including some old friends, reached out directly. \n \n \"Keshia Knight Pulliam, Malcolm-Jamal Warner and Sabrina Le Beauf [all Cosby Show alum] have all been in touch and all have been lovely, as you would expect friends to be,\" said the actor. \n \n As to whether he would go back to Trader Joe's if he needed to in the future, Owens didn't hesitate in answering: \"Yes.

(Associated Press) \n \n House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., speak to reporters about the massive government spending bill moving through Congress, on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, March 22, 2018. The bipartisan $1.3 trillion spending bill pours huge sums into... (Associated Press) \n \n WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Congress gave final approval Friday to a giant $1.3 trillion spending bill that ends the budget battles for now, but only after late obstacles skirted close to another shutdown as conservatives objected to big outlays on Democratic priorities at a time when Republicans control the House, Senate and White House. \n \n Senate passage shortly after midnight averted a third federal shutdown this year, an outcome both parties wanted to avoid. But in crafting a sweeping deal that busts budget caps, they've stirred conservative opposition and set the contours for the next funding fight ahead of the midterm elections. \n \n The House easily approved the measure Thursday, 256-167, a bipartisan tally that underscored the popularity of the compromise, which funds the government through September. It beefs up military and domestic programs, delivering federal funds to every corner of the country. \n \n But action stalled in the Senate, as conservatives ran the clock in protest. Then, an unusual glitch arose when Sen. James Risch, R-Idaho, wanted to remove a provision to rename a forest in his home state after the late Cecil Andrus, a four-term Democratic governor. \n \n At one point, Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., stepped forward to declare the entire late-night scene \"ridiculous. It's juvenile.\" \n \n Once the opponents relented, the Senate began voting, clearing the package by a 65-32 vote a full day before Friday's midnight deadline to fund the government. \n \n \"Shame, shame. A pox on both Houses - and parties,\" tweeted Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who spent the afternoon tweeting details found in the 2,200-page bill that was released the night before. \"No one has read it. Congress is broken.\" \n \n Paul said later he knew he could only delay, but not stop, the outcome and had made his point. \n \n The omnibus spending bill was supposed to be an antidote to the stopgap measures Congress has been forced to pass \u2014 five in this fiscal year alone \u2014 to keep government temporarily running amid partisan fiscal disputes. \n \n Leaders delivered on President Donald Trump's top priorities of boosting Pentagon coffers and starting work his promised border wall, while compromising with Democrats on funds for road building, child care development, fighting the opioid crisis and more. \n \n But the result has been unimaginable to many Republicans after campaigning on spending restraints and balanced budgets. Along with the recent GOP tax cuts law, the bill that stood a foot tall at some lawmakers' desks ushers in the return of $1 trillion deficits. \n \n Trump only reluctantly backed the bill he would have to sign, according to Republican lawmakers and aides, who acknowledged the deal involved necessary trade-offs for the Democratic votes that were needed for passage despite their majority lock on Congress. \n \n \"Obviously he doesn't like this process \u2014 it's dangerous to put it up to the 11th hour like this,\" said Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., who opposes the bill and speaks regularly to Trump. \"The president, and our leadership, and the leadership in the House got together and said, Look, we don't like what the Democrats are doing, we got to fund the government.\" \n \n White House legislative director Marc Short framed it as a compromise. \"I can't sit here and tell you and your viewers that we love everything in the bill,\" he said on Fox. \"But we think that we got many of our priorities funded.\" \n \n Trying to smooth over differences, Republican leaders focused on military increases that were once core to the party's brand as guardians of national security. \n \n \"Vote yes for our military. Vote yes for the safety and the security of this country,\" said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., ahead of voting. \n \n But even that remained a hard sell. In all, 90 House Republicans, including many from the conservative House Freedom Caucus, voted against the bill, as did two dozen Republicans in the Senate. \n \n It was a sign of the entrenched GOP divisions that have made leadership's job controlling the majority difficult. They will likely repeat on the next budget battle in fall. \n \n Democrats faced their own divisions, particularly after failing to resolve the stalemate over shielding young Dreamer immigrants from deportation as Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program has left it for the courts to decide. \n \n Instead, Trump won $1.6 billion to begin building and replacing segments of the wall along the border with Mexico. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus opposed the bill. \n \n Also missing from the package was a renewal of federal insurance subsidies to curb premium costs on the Affordable Care Act exchanges. Trump ended some of those payments as part of his effort to scuttle President Barack Obama's health care law, but Republicans have joined Democrats in trying to revive them. \n \n Bipartisan efforts to restore the subsidies, and provide additional help for insurance carriers, foundered over disagreements on how tight abortion restrictions should be on using the money for private insurance plans. Senate Republicans made a last-ditch effort to tuck the insurance provisions into the bill, but Democrats refused to yield on abortion restrictions. \n \n Still, Democrats were beyond pleased with the outcome. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., chronicled the party's many gains, and noted they could have just have easily withheld votes Republicans needed to avert another shutdown. \n \n \"We chose to use our leverage to help this bill pass,\" Pelosi said. \n \n Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said as the minority party in Congress, \"We feel good.\" He added, \"We produced a darn good bill.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Matthew Daly and Jill Colvin contributed to this report. \n \n Follow Mascaro on Twitter at https://twitter.com/LisaMascaro and Fram at https://twitter.com/AsFram",

It beefs up military and domestic programs, delivering federal funds to every corner of the country. But action stalled in the Senate as conservatives ran the clock in protest. Then, an unusual glitch arose when Sen. James Risch, an Idaho Republican, wanted to remove a provision to rename a forest in his home state after the late Cecil Andrus, a four-term Democratic governor. Once the opponents relented, the Senate began voting, clearing the package by a 65-32 vote a full day before Friday's midnight deadline to fund the government.

    "document": "\u201cNow, this is real simple,\u201d President Obama told a crowd at Prince George\u2019s Community College, in Maryland, in late September. \u201cIt\u2019s a Website where you can compare and purchase affordable health-insurance plans, side by side, the same way you shop for a plane ticket on Kayak \u2026 same way you shop for a TV on Amazon. You just go on, and you start looking, and here are all the options.\u201d \n \n As we all now know, the bug-infested Website healthcare.gov turned out to be anything but \u201creal simple.\u201d After the site\u2019s disastrous October 1 launch, the administration organized a frantic rescue effort shepherded by Jeffrey Zients, who is to become Obama\u2019s chief economic adviser in January, and on December 17, the administration tapped Microsoft executive Kurt DelBene to lead the effort to build out the rest of the Website. The site is working better (but as of this writing still not perfectly) for consumers, though the complications it has unleashed for President Obama will be even harder to fix. The New York Times called the broken Website a \u201ccrisis that suddenly threatened his presidency,\u201d and according to a CBS News poll, Obama\u2019s job-approval rating has plunged to an all-time low. Americans\u2019 approval of the Affordable Care Act has also dropped to its lowest level since CBS News began polling support for the law. \n \n The story of how the Obama administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the agencies tasked with implementing the Affordable Care Act got it so wrong is still unfolding. Much of the blame has to fall on an insular White House that didn\u2019t want to hear about problems, and another chunk has to land on CMS, which instead of hiring a systems integrator, whose job it would have been to ensure that all the processes feeding into healthcare.gov worked together, kept that role for itself. As anyone who has worked with the federal government on such projects knows, it is utterly inept when it comes to technology. \u201cThe government continues to struggle with how best to acquire the expertise to integrate technology,\u201d says Stan Soloway, the C.E.O. of the Professional Services Council, which represents contractors who work with the government. Soloway has a scary stat, which is that of the 80,000 information-technology workers in the federal government, for every one person under 30, there are 10 people over 50. \n \n That lack of expertise explains why in building healthcare.gov, the government turned to industry contractors; in particular, to CGI Federal, a subsidiary of CGI Group, a Canadian company. To those uninitiated in the dark art of government contracting, it seems scandalous that CGI, a company most Americans had never heard of, a company that is not located in Silicon Valley (where President Obama has plenty of Internet superstar friends who could have formed a dazzling brain trust to implement his signature legislation) but rather in Montreal, could be chosen as the lead contractor for the administration\u2019s most important initiative. While right-wing news outlets have focused on the possible relationship between Toni Townes-Whitley, senior vice president for civilian-agency programs at CGI Federal, and Michelle Obama, both of whom were 1985 Princeton graduates, CGI\u2019s selection is probably more an example of a dysfunctional system than it is a scandal. \u201cA lot of the companies in Silicon Valley don\u2019t do business with the government at that level [the level required for federal contracting],\u201d explains Soloway. \u201cIt is very burdensome, and the rules make it very unattractive.\u201d Indeed, government contractors have to meet a whole host of requirements contained in a foot-thick book, including cost accounting and excessive auditing, to prove that they are not profiting too much off the American taxpayer. Hence, there tends to be a relatively small, specialized group of companies that compete for this work, even on such critical matters as healthcare.gov. \n \n In this context, the selection of CGI, which has had a long relationship with the U.S. government through the companies it has acquired\u2014among other projects, CGI also ran recovery.gov, the Website for all data related to the Recovery Act\u2014doesn\u2019t seem so odd. Back in 2007, CGI was one of 16 companies given an umbrella contract to do unspecified systems work for CMS. These so-called indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity, or ID/IQ, contracts exist throughout the federal government. Companies compete to be on the list, and then when a specific task arises, they compete again to be awarded that task; but because the list of competitors is predetermined, the process is shorter. When the Obama administration selected a main contractor for healthcare.gov, they decided to use the prequalified contractors, rather than starting afresh, in order to save time, according to Bloomberg. CGI was chosen as the lead contractor for the Website over three other bidders: IBM, QSSI, and Computer Sciences Corporation. According to congressional testimony, CGI stands to be paid $292 million for its work on healthcare.gov. \n \n CGI\u2019s lack of visibility before healthcare.gov wasn\u2019t a reflection of the size of the company or how much work it does. With a market value of roughly $11.6 billion, CGI, after the decline of BlackBerry maker RIM, boasts of being Canada\u2019s biggest technology company. (All figures in this story are in Canadian dollars; one U.S. dollar is worth about 1.07 Canadian dollars at the present time.) In truth, companies like CGI are more body shops than true technology companies, and the projects they take on require a lot of grunt work by a lot of low-level employees. CGI employs almost 70,000 people, who are embedded in businesses and governments around the globe. Its U.S. clients have included the military, the F.B.I., Pennsylvania\u2019s Medicaid Medical Assistance program, and at least 40 state governments. \n \n CGI is short for Conseillers en Gestion et Informatique, or Consultants to Government and Industry. It was founded back in 1976 by two Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, Serge Godin and Andre Imbeau. The publicity-shy Godin, now 63 and still active as the company\u2019s chairman, became a billionaire this year, according to Slate, which called him a \u201cclassic tortoise\u201d who had built his fortune with a \u201creliable, and more patient, business strategy than stumbling on the right tech at the right time.\u201d He\u2019s received numerous awards and honorary titles, including being inducted into the Canadian Business Hall of Fame, and he is a major owner of harness-racing horses. His daughter, Julie Godin, is the company\u2019s executive in charge of human relations, and her father\u2019s presumptive heir. \n \n CGI has been a big stock-market success. According to the Canadian newspaper Globe and Mail, CGI\u2019s stock has risen an average of 25 percent annually for the last 25 years. At its peak in November, the stock was up almost 70 percent in 2013, and the problems of healthcare.gov seemed to be having no discernible impact. Slate said that that\u2019s because healthcare.gov is such a small part of its business. At any rate, CGI just reported revenues of $10.1 billion in its fiscal year ended in September 2013, up more than 100 percent from a year ago. \n \n Even before healthcare.gov, CGI was embroiled in its share of controversy about its work, from problems with Ontario\u2019s online medical registry to difficulties with the Department of Taxation\u2019s collection system in Hawaii. As CGI worked on healthcare.gov, government officials were frustrated with the company for missing deadlines, and Michelle Snyder, CMS\u2019s chief operating officer, told colleagues, \u201cIf we could fire them, we would,\u201d according to The New York Times. Both Marilyn Tavenner, CMS administrator, and Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of Health and Human Services, testified in congressional hearings that CGI didn\u2019t meet expectations. A CGI spokesperson says, \u201cas a matter of policy, we do not discuss the specifics of our ongoing client projects.\u201d \n \n On Wall Street, there\u2019s an entirely different sort of controversy brewing about CGI. Several smart investors\u2014including well-known short-seller Jim Chanos, who runs Kynikos Associates\u2014are betting against CGI, or shorting its shares, not because of the quality of its work but because of questions about its earnings. In September, Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Keane downgraded CGI to a rare \u201csell\u201d rating, citing quality-of-earnings questions. What he and others point out is that a number of questionable accounting tactics could be creating the illusion that CGI\u2019s business is far more successful than it actually is. After the news broke in Newsweek that Chanos was shorting CGI, its stock fell more than 12 percent, although it\u2019s begun to climb again. \n \n CGI is what\u2019s known as a \u201croll-up,\u201d meaning that it was built by acquiring other businesses, or rolling them up. Indeed, since its founding in 1976, CGI has acquired more than 70 businesses. (\u201cPlease stand up if you\u2019ve ever been acquired,\u201d Godin asked a crowd at a company gathering last February, according to the Globe and Mail. Almost everyone in the room stood up.) In the U.S., CGI built its business with the 2004 purchase of American Management Systems, based in Arlington, Virginia, and the $1.1 billion 2010 purchase of Stanley Inc., another Arlington, Virginia\u2013based company. Stanley\u2019s biggest customer was the U.S. Army, and the Stanley deal, according to Cormark Securities analyst Richard Tse, was instrumental in entrenching CGI with the government. \u201cThey are quite embedded,\u201d he told the Globe and Mail. \u201cStanley was an entity that was really effectively managing many of the back-office systems for government and military.\u201d Most recently, CGI bought Logica, a management-consultancy company headquartered in the United Kingdom. ||||| CGI Federal, the company responsible for building the problem-plagued Web site for the Affordable Care Act, won the job because of what federal officials deemed a \u201ctechnically superior\u201d proposal, according to government documents and people familiar with the decision. \n \n Not considered in the 2011 selection process was the history of numerous executives at CGI Federal, who had come from another company that had mishandled at least 20 other government \u00adinformation technology projects more than a decade ago. But federal officials were not required to examine that long-term track record, which included a highly publicized failure to automate retirement benefits for millions of federal workers. \n \n By 2011, CGI Federal already had been cleared to do government work at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency overseeing the rollout of the new health-care law. \n \n The company had been included in a pool of pre-screened, approved contractors in 2007, during the George W. Bush administration, and only firms in that pool were later allowed to bid for the Affordable Care Act work. It was at that earlier time that the problems at American Management Systems, the Fairfax County IT contractor acquired by CGI, would have figured into the assessment of CGI Federal, contracting experts say. \n \n In hindsight, one former CMS official said, the AMS record \u201ccould well have knocked [CGI Federal] out of the competition, and probably should have.\u201d \n \n View Graphic A look at the consumer's route through the HealthCare.gov website and the potential failure points. \n \n In light of the bungled launch of the health-care Web site, critics have repeatedly asked how CGI Federal got the contract, and there has been widespread speculation on online news sites and blogs that the firm was selected because of political ties to the Obama administration. \n \n But a review of internal documents and interviews with former and current federal officials show that the selection process was walled off from politics. \n \n Career officials at CMS, working out of an obscure Baltimore-based contracting office, focused in 2011 on the proposals submitted by four bidders, examining technical competency and cost while giving relatively little attention to past performance. Since 2007, CGI Federal had won 17 other CMS jobs under the pre-screened contract, worth several hundred million dollars. \n \n The review of CGI Federal concluded there was \u201cno evidence of performance risk,\u201d according to a CMS document, portions of which were read to The Washington Post by a person familiar with the contracting process. \n \n CGI Federal won the $93 million contract, now worth $293 million, in September 2011. \n \n At the time of the earlier selection process in 2007, CGI Federal was still relatively new to federal contracting. It had grown out of CGI Group\u2019s acquisition in 2004 of AMS, which had a recent history of troubled projects, including a Philadelphia school computer system that sent paychecks to dead people and a Mississippi tax system so dysfunctional that a jury awarded a $474 million verdict against the firm. \n \n Three former CMS officials said in recent interviews that the AMS problems should have raised red flags. \n \n \u201cShould CMS have recognized that \u2018Okay, here\u2019s CGI Federal. It\u2019s a new company, but, oh, my God, it looks a lot like the AMS from yesterday\u2019?\u201d asked one former CMS official familiar with the contracting process who like others interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal procedures. \u201cYes. I would consider that dropping the ball.\u2019\u2019 \n \n Tasha Bradley, a CMS spokeswoman, said in a statement that the agency \u201cadheres by a long- \n \n established contracting process where expert, career contracting officials evaluate and award contracts based on criteria outlined in the contract solicitation, including past performance, technical expertise and proposed contract value.\u201d \n \n CMS declined to comment on specific questions about how closely CGI Federal\u2019s past performance was evaluated and whether that review looked at AMS. \n \n Former AMS executives have defended that company\u2019s performance, and CGI officials have rejected any comparison with AMS\u2019s earlier failures. \n \n CGI Federal has also defended its work on HealthCare.gov, despite an October launch that White House officials have acknowledged was disastrous. Federal officials have faulted the company\u2019s performance, saying it missed deadlines, understaffed the job and overstated its progress. \n \n People familiar with the project have said it was also hampered by administration mismanagement, fierce Republican opposition and political sensitivities that delayed policy and regulatory decisions. \n \n The federal online marketplace that is selling health plans in 36 states under the 2010 health-care law has been functioning better in recent weeks, but officials are still working to fix lingering problems, including errors in enrollment records sent to insurance companies. CGI Federal remains intimately involved in the project, writing computer code in attempts to fix various aspects of the system. \n \n Linda Odorisio, CGI\u2019s vice president for global communications, said the company \u201ccontinues to work closely with CMS and all of its vendor partners to deliver continuous enhancements in system performance and the user experience\u201d on the Web site. \n \n She added that CGI Federal \u201ccontributed to the significant improvements made to the system over the last two months, resulting in more than half a million Americans enrolling in just the first three weeks of December.\u201d \n \n Umbrella contract \n \n In December 2006, CMS put out a request for proposals. The agency said it was seeking \u201cworld-class IT services\u201d to improve and maintain the massive systems that run Medicare and Medicaid, according to contracting documents. Thirty-one bidders responded, including CGI Federal. \n \n CMS used a procurement method that has become increasingly common over the past decade. The agency first awarded an umbrella contract to a group of firms, and those firms were then eligible to bid on future IT work. Experts say this saves the government time because it shortens the subsequent bid process. \n \n In evaluating the bids, CMS was to scrutinize each company\u2019s performance on previous contracts, according to an internal agency document obtained by The Post. The document described a \u201crisk assessment\u201d of cost control, on-time delivery and other factors. \n \n Federal law requires that past performance be considered for all federal contracts worth more than $150,000, with limited exceptions. Federal regulations also say CMS should have considered the record of \u201cpredecessor companies,\u201d such as AMS. Several former officials familiar with the 2007 selection said no concerns about CGI Federal were raised inside the agency. \n \n AMS projects had run into trouble at the federal level and in at least 12 states, according to government audit reports, interviews and news accounts. The purchase of AMS was CGI\u2019s entree into the U.S. government market, and AMS executives flocked to CGI Federal. Today, more than 100 former AMS employees are senior executives or consultants working for CGI in the Washington area. \n \n One former CMS official said the agency especially should have examined the most publicized AMS failure, an effort to automate retirement benefits for millions of federal workers. AMS was fired in 2001 by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board after going $60 million over budget, writing computer code that turned out to be useless and never delivering a workable system, according to government reports. \n \n AMS had settled lawsuits arising from the project in 2003. \u201cThat should have stood out,\u2019\u2019 the former official said. \n \n CGI Federal was ultimately chosen for an umbrella contract, worth up to $4 billion in future work, along with 15 other firms, including Lockheed Martin and IBM. \n \n While it is unclear whether agency officials examined the AMS track record, former CMS officials said it probably would not have made much difference, because past performance has long been an overlooked component of federal contracting. \n \n Deadline pressure \n \n In the summer of 2011, the Obama administration was racing to figure out who would build the Affordable Care Act\u2019s all-important Web site. \u201cTime is of the essence,\u201d said an internal CMS draft request for proposals, dated June 24, 2011. \n \n With deadlines looming, officials limited the bidders to the winners of the 2007 umbrella contract. \u201cThere was very great time pressure,\u201d recalled a former CMS official familiar with the process. \u201cThe feeling was we had a lot of big IT powerhouses and they knew our work.\u2019\u2019 \n \n Four firms applied: IBM, Computer Sciences Corp., Quality Software Services and CGI Federal. \n \n As is tradition, the selection process was strictly sheltered from political considerations and political appointees at CMS or elsewhere in the administration, according to numerous former and current CMS employees. \n \n \u201cI deliberately stayed out of contracting,\u2019\u2019 said Leslie Norwalk, the agency\u2019s acting administrator under President George W. Bush. \u201cIf that had changed, I would have heard rumblings.\u2019\u2019 \n \n Agency documents show that a career contracting officer, in the CMS Office of Acquisition and Grants Management, was in charge of awarding the contract for the Web site. The selection process focused on bidders\u2019 business and technical proposals, which described the proposed cost, hardware and software required, proposed infrastructure design, security requirements, and key personnel. \n \n The companies\u2019 past performance was not a priority. The CMS document listed it as the second least important of seven technical evaluation factors. And the review would look only at past work under the 2007 umbrella contract, the document said. \n \n While the review found no performance risk for CGI Federal, agency officials had not always been satisfied with the company\u2019s work. In 2010, CMS rejected CGI Federal\u2019s bid under the umbrella contract to perform work on four health IT systems, in part citing unspecified performance issues in carrying out an earlier contract, according to a Government Accountability Office ruling. CGI Federal protested the CMS decision, but the GAO upheld it. \n \n And the review did not take into account problems that several other CGI projects had encountered, including years of delay and system failures on a state computer system in Hawaii. State auditors in 2010 partially faulted another CGI subsidiary, CGI Technologies and Solutions, for those issues. \n \n CGI says its overall work is high-quality and nearly always on time and on budget, and the company has also had many successes. In the past two years, CGI Federal has been awarded contracts with at least 25 federal agencies. \n \n Documents and interviews show that CGI Federal was selected because of what was deemed to be the company\u2019s technical prowess, even though the price of the firm\u2019s proposal was higher than that of at least of one competitor.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It turns out there were even more reasons the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services shouldn't have picked the free-wheeling and allegedly shady CGI Federal to build HealthCare.gov. When CGI was vetted back in 2007, it didn't have any obvious black marks on its record, the Washington Post explains. But CGI is a \"roll-up\" company formed by acquiring other companies\u2014one of which, American Management Systems, was one giant black mark. AMS projects have hit trouble in at least 12 states as well as at the federal level, including a much-publicized 2001 failure to automate federal retirement benefits.

The oblique membranous division of the basal segment of the anterior lateral spinnerets of Trogloraptor suggests that this haplogyne family is the sister group of the other Dysderoidea (Dysderidae, Oonopidae, Orsolobidae and Segestriidae). Trogloraptor is known only from caves and old growth forest understory in the Klamath-Siskiyou region of Oregon and California. Full text: HTML | XML | PDF ||||| They managed to avoid the notice of nosy humans beings for thousands of years, mostly by clinging to the roofs of dark caves and keeping their six, tiny eyes peeled for trouble. \n \n But the secret existence of these eight-legged West Coasters has come to an end. \n \n On Friday, scientists announced the discovery of a heretofore unknown family of spider that some have playfully compared to Bigfoot, the privacy-loving man-beast of legend. \n \n In the journal Zookeys, California Academy of Sciences arachnologist Charles E. Griswold and colleagues described their discovery of trogloraptor, or \u201ccave robber,\u201d a spider that is partial to caves and redwood debris in coastal forests from California to British Columbia. \n \n Trogloraptor, which is roughly the size of a half-dollar coin when its legs are extended, has large raptorial claws, suggesting it is a fierce, specialized predator. \n \n Roughly a dozen specimens were plucked from the roofs of caves by scientists and spelunkers who found them hanging from a few strands of spun silk. Most were obtained in southwest Oregon, while one adolescent spider was found in the debris of old-growth redwoods in northwest California. \n \n The newly discovered arachnid is not about to give up all its long-held secrets, however. Scientists have yet to determine exactly how it mates, or what it eats. Captive trogloraptors have so far refused to eat a variety of prey provided in the lab. \n \n The Klamath-Siskiyou region of Oregon and California is home to a number of ancient species of plants and animals, including the coastal red tailed frog and the mountain beaver. Study authors note that with many caves and hard-to-access areas, this may not be the last historic find. \n \n \u201cIf such a large and bizarre spider could have gone undetected for so long, who knows what else may lurk undiscovered in this remarkable part of the world,\u201d the study said. \n \n By examining the spider under an electron microscope, etymologists found a number of unique features that suggested a very ancient lineage. The discovery may yet result in some revisions to their understanding of spider evolution. \n \n Among those groups who helped to collect the specimens were the Western Cave Conservancy, the California Academy of Sciences and San Diego State University. \n \n Follow me on Twitter @montemorin",

We think these work to snap and trap their prey.\" Much is still a mystery about these newly discovered spiders, although scientists think the Trogloraptor evolved separately from more commonly known spiders thanks to their remote cave locations. \"If such a large and bizarre spider could have gone undetected for so long, who knows what else may lurk undiscovered in this remarkable part of the world,\" says the study.

    "document": "Throughout his insurgent campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, one of Bernie Sanders\u2019s chief rallying points was to question why the United States is the \u201conly major country on Earth not to guarantee health care to all people.\u201d Having taken the issue into the political mainstream, the independent senator from Vermont is turning his broad idea into something more concrete by rolling out a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d bill on the floor of the Senate on Wednesday. \n \n Related: If Bernie Sanders wants to win 2020 election, he needs to control his supporters, Democrats say \n \n Even Sanders has acknowledged that it\u2019s \u201cobvious\u201d the bill has no chance of passing with the Senate (and House) controlled by Republicans. But he has already succeeded in pushing the issue further into the spotlight and pressuring Democrats to jump on board. Support for the bill has become a practical litmus test for the party\u2019s 2020 presidential hopefuls. \n \n After California Senator Kamala Harris signed last month, other potential 2020 candidates\u2014Senators Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand\u2014were among those to take the number of bill co-sponsors to 11 as of Tuesday afternoon. \n \n The simple tenant of the proposal is to put in place in the U.S. a single-payer system akin to that used in the U.K., France, Australia, Canada and others. These can differ from fully government-run national health services, as in the U.K., to France\u2019s public/private hybrid. Whatever route they take, though, they offer universal health care and no requirement to get insurance through an employer. In the U.S., the current Medicare safety net, which now covers only people over age 65, would apply to all Americans. \n \n \u201cHealth care must be recognized as a right, not a privilege,\u201d Sanders argues. \u201cEvery man, woman and child in our country should be able to access the health care they need regardless of their income. The only long-term solution to America\u2019s health care crisis is a single-payer national health care program.\u201d \n \n Sanders has said that the plan would in large part be paid for by a progressive tax system that would have the richest households paying more income, capital gains and estate taxes, among others. Existing health care expenditures would also go toward the plan. According to Sanders, his plan would save the American people and businesses $6 trillion over the next decade. \n \n While there is widespread evidence to support the notion that a single-payer system is far more cost-effective than the current model in the United States, the exact savings under Sanders\u2019s plan remains a topic for much debate. \n \n Still, although Republicans and even more moderate Democrats aren\u2019t rushing to sign onto a single-payer system anytime soon, polls have showed that Americans have already moved in that direction. A June 2017 Pew Research Center survey found that 60 percent of Americans said the federal government should be responsible for ensuring health care coverage for all Americans. \n \n Update: An earlier version of this story misspelled the name of Kirsten Gillibrand. This has been corrected. ||||| Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and his call for a government-run health care system are back. On Wednesday, he is laying out a bill that proposes \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d replacing a U.S. health care system dominated by employer-provided insurance \u2014 with lots of assorted co-payments and deductibles \u2014 to a single-payer approach in which higher taxes fund a system where individuals don\u2019t pay directly for health care. Influential Democratic senators and potential 2020 candidates Cory Booker (New Jersey), Kirsten Gillibrand (New York), Kamala Harris (California), Jeff Merkley (Oregon) and Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts) have embraced the idea. \n \n \u201cMedicare for all\u201d is going absolutely nowhere anytime soon under a Republican-controlled Congress and President Trump. But here\u2019s the big question: Is it going to become one of the central goals of the Democratic Party and a defining feature of the campaign of whichever Democrat is the party\u2019s nominee in 2020? This seems very likely, at least right now, given the political forces pulling Democrats to the left. But I\u2019m not totally sure, mainly because there are some clear political and policy reasons for Democrats to avoid becoming the party of single-payer. \n \n Why the Democratic nominee may have to strongly embrace Medicare-for-all \n \n \n \n 1. Some of the party\u2019s most popular figures are already behind it. \n \n FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Nate Silver and Vox\u2019s Matt Yglesias have argued that Sanders is, at least right now, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination for president. If Sanders, who is 76, opts not to run, the 68-year-old Warren seems like an obvious person for Sanders backers to embrace, as she shares many of the same liberal and populist positions. Harris, the daughter of an Indian woman and a Jamaican man, was elected district attorney in San Francisco and has won statewide election three times in California, which is about 40 percent Latino. A candidate with appeal to Asian, black and Latino voters as well as upper-income whites in cities like San Francisco would be formidable in a Democratic primary. I think it\u2019s fair to say that all three of these senators would rank among the top 10 current contenders for the Democratic nomination. Booker is rumored to be considering a run as well. (The online betting site PredictIt ranks these four as among the top five people likely to get the Democratic nomination in 2020, along with former Vice President Joe Biden.) \n \n So Booker, Harris, Sanders and Warren already being for Medicare-for-all greatly increases the chances of the Democratic nominee in 2020 supporting this policy, simply because one of that quartet has a strong chance of being the nominee. And staking out this position, well to the left of where the party was even last November, puts pressure on Biden, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and other Democrats who might be considering a 2020 run. Even if one of those candidates privately disagrees with the merits or the strategy of pushing Medicare-for-all, he or she might opt to support the idea to avoid being tagged as insufficiently liberal and therefore out of step with the party\u2019s activist base. \n \n This is how presidential nomination processes often work. In the campaign for the 2008 Democratic nomination, John Edwards came out with a comprehensive health insurance plan, effectively forcing Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton to do the same. (The Edwards plan, with its individual mandate and emphasis on creating health insurance marketplaces, was one of the building blocks of what eventually became the Affordable Care Act.) \n \n This intra-party competition is the biggest and clearest reason to assume Medicare-for-all will become party dogma. \n \n 2. The Democrats are becoming a more liberal party. \n \n In 2012, according to the Pew Research Center, about 19 percent of self-described Democrats considered themselves conservative, about 36 percent said they were liberal, and about 41 percent said moderate. Today, a plurality of Democrats (48 percent) describe themselves as liberal. A shift to Medicare-for-all would be in line with this march to the left. \n \n And the party\u2019s elected officials are headed there, too. The new \u201cBetter Deal\u201d agenda that congressional Democrats unveiled in July includes a number of Sanders-inspired populist ideas. The party rebranding effort, for example, calls for requiring prescription drug companies to submit an explanation to the U.S. government if they increase the price of a drug by too much. \n \n Want more politics news? Get it in your inbox. \n \n In this environment, it is much easier to see a centrist Democrat like Cuomo essentially accepting Medicare-for-all as a stance he must take rather than pushing Democratic activists away from Medicare-for-all. \n \n 3. The Obamacare experience is moving Democrats. \n \n In 2009 and 2010, when he was stumping for the Affordable Care Act, Obama often highlighted the private marketplaces that would be set up under the law. He mentioned how the ACA would expand Medicaid less often, perhaps with an eye on winning over more independent or conservative-leaning voters who might be leery of more government intervention in the health care system. \n \n But in practice, the private marketplaces have been beset with high rates and insurers fleeing the system, while Medicaid expansion has been popular. This year, as Republicans sought to repeal the ACA, Democrats hammered them on Medicaid, which would have been cut by billions of dollars in the GOP repeal proposals. This defense of Medicaid by Democrats seemed to force even Republican senators like Nevada\u2019s Dean Heller to say they were committed to defending the program. \n \n \u201cOne thing has saved the Affordable Care Act from Republicans\u2019 efforts to repeal it: When the votes counted, at least three Republican senators \u2014 along with every Democrat in the Senate \u2014 could not accept massive cuts to Medicaid,\u201d wrote Mark Schmitt, who runs the Political Reform program at the D.C.-based think tank New America and was a longtime Democratic staffer on Capitol Hill. \n \n Putting more people on government-funded health care programs is an idea that Democrats often favor but sometimes sidestep because they think it is too politically difficult to get adopted. (Obama, in an interview with Vox in January, essentially said that he thought a single-payer system would be more effective, but didn\u2019t think it was possible to get that passed in 2009 or 2010.) The ACA experience has led Democrats \u2014 even those who strongly promoted and defended Obamacare \u2014 to argue that the ACA has not fixed enough of the country\u2019s health care problems and push for a more comprehensive solution. \n \n Party officials now believe that the public may be open to such a proposal. \u201cIt\u2019s always the biggest applause line,\u201d U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth of Kentucky, a Democrat, told me. \n \n Warren, in a blog post on her website, carefully praised the achievement at the center of Obama\u2019s legacy while signaling a desire to move beyond it, writing: \u201cWe owe a huge debt to President Obama. Because of the Affordable Care Act, health care coverage is better. \u2026 But there\u2019s so much more we could do right now to bring down the costs of quality health care for every American.\u201d \n \n Why the Democratic nominee may be not strongly for Medicare-for-all. \n \n \n \n 1. A Medicare-for-all candidate may not win the primary. \n \n There was a lot of talk in 2013 about how the Republican presidential nominee three years later would be more liberal on immigration issues than past candidates because of how badly Republicans did in the 2012 election with non-white voters. One of the people pushing that way on immigration (Marco Rubio) also seemed a likely top-tier presidential candidate, the way Booker, Harris, Sanders and Warren are. We know how that turned out. \n \n Some combination of Booker, Harris, Sanders and Warren may not run for president. They might all run and lose. And the candidate who wins the Democratic nomination could be someone who breaks from the Medicare-for-all view, or at least says that he or she is open to other ideas to improve America\u2019s health care system. Maybe that will be a figure like Biden or Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, either of whom might run for president and could position themselves as the center-left alternative to the more liberal candidates. In fact \u2026 \n \n 2. Medicare-for-all is not the only way to expand government-run health insurance. \n \n Liberal wonks, such as Paul Krugman, are not so sure about Medicare-for-all. They argue that such a system is actually extremely complicated to create and that the final product might irritate the millions of Americans who have insurance through their employer and like it. \n \n So some Democrats are proposing ideas like Medicare-for-some (U.S Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut) or Medicaid-for-some (U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii). The general idea is that people who are uninsured could buy (or be enrolled for little cost if they don\u2019t make much money) into these programs. \n \n This kind of a policy would be less of a shift to the left. Obama proposed a \u201cpublic option\u201d in 2009 that would have been similar to the ideas of buying into Medicare or Medicaid that Murphy and Schatz are touting. He dropped the idea after some more conservative Democrats opposed it, but by the end of his presidency, Obama had strongly embraced the idea. Hillary Clinton included a public option in her 2016 platform, though it was not a big feature of her campaign. \n \n Maybe a more moderate Democrat could campaign on expanded Medicaid and Medicare but downplay the \u201cfor all\u201d part. And that might have appeal because \u2026 \n \n 3. Many Democratic voters are not liberal. \n \n I described earlier how liberals are ascendant in the Democratic Party. But according to Pew, the combined group of self-identified moderates (36 percent) and conservatives (15 percent) is as large as the liberals. Whites, people with college degrees, and millennials are disproportionately liberal, while other demographics in the party are not. According to Pew, 55 percent of white Democrats consider themselves liberal, compared with 28 percent of black Democrats and 41 percent of Latinos. About 60 percent of Democrats with postgraduate degrees consider themselves liberals, compared with about 37 percent of Democrats with a high school degree or less. \n \n You could imagine New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu pitching himself as the candidate who can appeal to working-class whites and more moderate Democrats. And part of that pitch could be running on a health care plan that is more likely to be passed into law than Medicare-for-all. \n \n In June, Pew polled Americans on creating a \u201csingle-payer\u201d health care system. Only 33 percent of the public overall supported the idea, although 52 percent of Democrats backed it. I assume Democratic support for Medicare-for-all will grow with more leading figures in the party embracing it. Also, the poll asked people about a single national health insurance system run by the government, not \u201cMedicare-for-all,\u201d which I suspect is a much more popular notion. But the survey did not ask respondents about \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d versus \u201cMedicare-for-some,\u201d which might also be a popular idea. So public opinion on this issue could well shift in a number of directions. \n \n I\u2019m inclined to think that whoever receives the Democratic nomination in 2020 will support Medicare-for-all, either because he or she truly believes in the idea or because party politics effectively force this. I\u2019m not so sure that this idea will ever become U.S. policy \u2014 or even come to a vote in Congress. But its embrace by Booker, Harris and Warren less than a year after the election tells us two important things about American politics right now: Sanders lost the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination, but he may have emerged as the party\u2019s intellectual leader. And the Democrats appear to have concluded from 2016 that, at least on economic issues, they should move left, not right. ||||| Bernie Sanders\u2019 single-payer health care plan has won over most other liberal senators, including many weighing 2020 bids. \n \n The rest of the Democratic Party is another matter. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n As Sanders prepares to unveil his Medicare for All legislation on Wednesday, most of the party\u2019s congressional leaders and vulnerable Senate incumbents are steering clear. Even as the left celebrates Sanders\u2019 ability to push the Democratic agenda leftward after his primary challenge to Hillary Clinton last year, that success appears to have its limits. \n \n Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters that he would be \u201clooking at all of\u201d the party\u2019s \u201cmany good\u201d proposals to expand health care access, but declined to back Sanders. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi declared that her priority is shielding Obamacare from a GOP repeal push that\u2019s not yet dead for good. \n \n Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, one of the few Democrats subject to 2020 speculation who has not signed on to the Sanders bill, warned against letting the party\u2019s attention slip to \u201clonger-term health care policy\u201d while the future of the Affordable Care Act remains up for debate. \n \n \u201cI think the risk is that we get distracted,\u201d Murphy told reporters. \u201cSeptember\u2019s not done. They can still ram through a repeal bill.\u201d \n \n Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin on Tuesday became the single-payer bill\u2019s first supporter from the class of Senate Democrats up for reelection next year in states Trump carried. But other politically imperiled incumbent Democrats have said no to Sanders. \n \n POLITICO Pulse newsletter Get the latest on the health care fight, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

Claire McCaskill said in a brief interview that lawmakers have more work to do to keep health care costs in check \u201cbefore we would think about expanding that [Medicare] system to everyone.\u201d \n \n Single-payer on a national level would have \u201ca lot of problems,\u201d McCaskill added, although she came out in support of allowing individuals as young as 55 to buy into Medicare. That idea is also backed by Baldwin and two other red-state Democrats up for reelection next year who are declining to endorse Sanders\u2019 bill: Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan. \n \n Stabenow, also a member of Democratic leadership, said Tuesday that she would keep working on her Medicare-at-55 plan \u201cbecause I think there is some bipartisan interest in that.\u201d She said the party\u2019s first order of business should be shoring up the Obamacare markets, followed by other goals. \n \n \u201cThe first thing has to be to protect the health care people have now and stabilize markets, no question,\u201d Stabenow said. \u201cBut we need to focus on lowering the cost of prescription drugs and providing more health care, more health care options.\u201d \n \n Improving the Affordable Care Act is the core of a bipartisan effort in the Senate health committee.

Patty Murray of Washington, a member of the Democratic leadership, also declined to endorse Sanders\u2019 bill on Tuesday. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of Democratic ideas out there, and I haven\u2019t had the chance to look at all of them,\u201d Murray said, adding that she remains \u201cvery focused\u201d on the committee\u2019s work. \n \n Republicans have already seized on the high costs of imposing a single-payer system \u2014 which Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign proposed to pay for with new taxes on employers and wealthy individuals \u2014 to hammer Democrats for supporting the idea. The National Republican Senatorial Committee criticized Baldwin on Tuesday for backing \u201cthe left\u2019s radical plans for government-run health care.\u201d \n \n Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), a member of GOP leadership, also reminded reporters Tuesday that Sanders\u2019 home state of Vermont had to back away from its own single-payer health proposal after the economic burden proved too onerous. \n \n Backers of the Sanders bill acknowledge that single-payer is a heavy political lift but describe it as an important benchmark for Democrats\u2019 future. As the party hones its identity beyond opposition to Trump\u2019s agenda, single-payer fans see enough room to set big long-term goals while waging the shorter-term battle to protect Obamacare. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s nothing about the politics of the moment or the Affordable Care Act that in any way precludes supporting Medicare-for-all as the ultimate goal, and there\u2019s a clear path to it,\u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal. The Connecticut Democrat signed on to the bill Tuesday. \n \n Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), who has been mentioned as a possible 2020 candidate, also expects to sign on to the single-payer bill, a spokesman said Tuesday. Franken noted that his cosponsorship reflects the bill's status as a long-term goal while the party continues short-term work on Obamacare. \n \n \"This bill is aspirational, and I\u2019m hopeful that it can serve as a starting point for where we need to go as a country,\" Franken said in a statement. \"In the short term, however, I strongly believe we must pursue bipartisan policies that improve our current health care system for all Americans \u2014 and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing right now in the Senate Health Committee, on which both Senator Sanders and I sit.\" \n \n For other Democrats, however, the idea\u2019s time may have not yet come. \n \n Ben Cardin said in an interview that he supports universal health coverage but has \"certain concerns\" about using single-payer to achieve that goal. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s the political issue, but there\u2019s also the issue about how you make sure there will be adequate resources put into health care,\u201d the Maryland Democrat said. \n \n Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a member of leadership who's among the GOP's top targets in 2018, walked a fine line Tuesday as Republicans revived his past comments welcoming a discussion of a government-run health care system. \n \n \"I am skeptical that single-payer is the right solution, but I believe that the Senate should carefully consider all of the options through regular order so that we can fully understand the impacts of these ideas on both our people and our economy,\" Manchin said in a statement on Tuesday. \n \n Sen. Dianne Feinstein, facing consternation from liberals in her home state of California \u2014 where an effort to enact single-payer statewide ran aground this year \u2014 said that she would want to see the price tag before taking a position on Sanders' bill. \n \n \"My understanding is, the cost of single-payer is enormous,\" Feinstein said, noting that she supports a public option for health insurance outside the private market. \n \n Murphy and Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz have offered their own ideas to shift the party's health care debate leftward without going as far as Sanders' plan would. The Connecticut Democrat is working on legislation creating a Medicare buy-in for all individuals and businesses, while Schatz told POLITICO he expects to release a Medicaid buy-in proposal later this month. \n \n Murphy said he would not sign on to Sanders' bill before its release, urging \"our party to take some time and look at all the options available to us before we decide on one unitary route.\" \n \n And even as some Sanders-aligned activists spook Democrats with talk of possible primary challenges to candidates who don't support the single-payer plan, other liberals were content to cheer the Vermont independent for attracting more than one-quarter of the caucus to his legislation. Progressive Change Campaign Committee co-founder Adam Green, who worked with Murphy on the Medicare buy-in plan, said that \"Democrats are increasingly wrapping themselves in the flag of\" Medicare for all without closing off other options that advance the ball. \n \n \"This is how big ideas like expanding Social Security and debt-free college were moved into the mainstream \u2014 the North Star gets put up, solid organizing is done, critical mass is built in Congress and on the campaign trail, and party consensus falls into place,\" Green said by email. \"It's happening now.\" ||||| Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., second from right, declines to speak with a reporter as he walks to a luncheon with Democrats on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Sept. 12, 2017. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) (Associated Press) \n \n WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders is ready to unveil his bill for starkly reshaping the country's current hodge-podge health care system into one where the government provides medical insurance for everybody. \n \n Republican senators are preparing to roll out details of a last-ditch effort to repeal and replace President Barack Obama's health care law. \n \n The rival packages have little in common, other than the likelihood that neither is going anywhere. \n \n Seven weeks after the GOP drive to uproot Obama's 2010 health care law crashed in the Senate, two Republican senators, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Louisiana's Bill Cassidy, on Wednesday were releasing their plan for trying again. \n \n They've struggled for weeks to round up sufficient support for the package. It would cut and reshape Medicaid, disperse money spent under Obama's law directly to states and erase Obama's penalties on people who don't purchase coverage. \n \n No. 3 Senate GOP leader John Thune of South Dakota said Graham and Cassidy would need \"a double-double bank shot\" to prevail, a joking reference to an impossible basketball shot. \n \n Like the failed Senate GOP repeal effort in July, the Graham-Cassidy push will get zero Democratic support. That means Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., will need 50 of the 52 Republican senators, a margin he couldn't reach in July and is struggling to reach now. \n \n Despite badgering by President Donald Trump that he keep trying, McConnell has expressed no interest in staging yet another vote that produces an embarrassing rejection by the GOP-controlled Senate. Conservatives are wary because the bill falls short in erasing Obama's wide-ranging coverage requirements. \n \n \"I don't think this bill will go anywhere,\" said Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. \n \n Meanwhile, Sanders is introducing his bill for essentially expanding the Medicare health insurance program for the elderly to all Americans. \n \n The progressive wing of the Democratic Party backs his bill, which would make health care less expensive and less complicated for many people and businesses. It would cover the 28 million Americans remaining uninsured despite Obama's law. \n \n People would simply flash a card and be entitled to coverage, without out-of-pocket expenses like deductibles, according to Sanders aides. They would pay income-adjusted premiums, with the poorest paying nothing but the rich and profitable corporations seeing higher taxes, and people and businesses would no longer owe premiums to insurers. \n \n Some Democrats fear the Vermont independent is exposing them to a lose-lose choice. \n \n Don't support Sanders' plan and risk alienating the party's liberal, activist voters, volunteers and contributors. Back it and be accused by Republicans of backing a huge tax increase and government-run health care, and taking away employer-provided coverage for half the country that many people like. \n \n Sanders rejects that. \n \n \"Because the people in this country want to move toward a Medicare-for-all system, that is divisive?\" he said in an interview Tuesday, citing polls showing growing support. \n \n At least 12 other Senate Democrats signed onto Sanders' bill by late Tuesday, including four potential presidential contenders: Kamala Harris of California, Massachusetts' Elizabeth Warren, New York's Kirsten Gillibrand and Cory Booker of New Jersey. \n \n \"It may be a good strategy toward getting the nomination\" to be the Democratic presidential nominee, said Ron Pollack, chair emeritus of the liberal Families USA, who backs universal coverage but thinks Sanders' plan is politically unrealistic. \"I don't think it's a good strategy for the general election.\" \n \n To cover themselves, several Democrats are introducing their own bills that expand coverage without going as far as Sanders, including possible presidential aspirants Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Ohio's Sherrod Brown. Several Democrats facing tough re-election battles next year in GOP-leaning states say they want to focus on strengthening Obama's existing law, including Montana's Jon Tester and Missouri's Claire McCaskill. \n \n Republicans say they're ready. \n \n \"We welcome the Democrats' strategy of moving even further left,\" said Katie Martin, spokeswoman for the Senate GOP's campaign organization. \n \n A third effort, a bipartisan attempt to shore up individual insurance markets around the country, is showing early signs that the sides are having problems reaching agreement. \n \n Sens. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Patty Murray, D-Wash., hope to reach a deal on continuing for at least a year the federal payments to insurers that Trump has threatened to halt. Republicans are also insisting on easing the Obama law's coverage requirements, which Democrats don't want to do. \n \n Alexander said Tuesday that Republicans want \"real state flexibility\" to let insurers offer \"a larger variety of benefits and payment rules.\" \n \n Murray said she worried the GOP wants to \"wind up increasing out-of-pocket costs for patients and families.\" That's something Democrats oppose. \n \n McConnell said the Alexander-Murray talks \"are underway and we'll see where they go.\" ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Costs are lower across Europe, Canada and Australia, where government plays a bigger role in medical care than here, and citizens in many of those places live longer than Americans. This is the single best argument for single-payer. \n \n \u201cIn America, we should join every industrialized country and guarantee health care to all Americans as a right,\u201d Sanders told Stephen Colbert last week. \n \n 3. Could the United States keep its distinctive advantages under single-payer? \n \n The American system is expensive and inefficient. It also produces many of the world\u2019s most important medical innovations \u2014 new drugs, devices, treatments and the like \u2014 and is home to many of the best hospitals and researchers. That\u2019s why wealthy people from other countries often come here for treatment. \n \n It\u2019s certainly conceivable that a single-payer system could retain these advantages while making American health care less wasteful. But I\u2019d like to hear a fuller explanation from advocates about how it all would work. \n \n 4. How will single-payer overcome its political obstacles? \n \n Even if single-payer reduces costs and lifts quality, the transition would be very tricky. Many people would be forced to change insurance plans even if they liked their current coverage. (Ask Barack Obama how popular that would be.) And money that Americans are now spending on private health care would instead have to be funneled into higher taxes. \n \n Sanders deserves credit for both the passion and detail he is bringing to the subject. Yet his plan from the 2016 campaign was not realistic about the necessary tax increase, as an analysis by the Urban Institute, a left-leaning think tank, showed. The recent failure of single-payer in left-leaning Vermont, which helped end the governor\u2019s political career, shows how brutal the politics are. \n \n 5. Is this a yes-or-no subject, or is there a middle ground? \n \n Ah, my favorite question. There is indeed a middle ground. ||||| Good Friday morning.

Why it matters: Wolff captures the contempt some Trump aides have for the president and his family. Axios' Jonathan Swan notes that this includes people you see trumpeting their loyalty to him. \n \n Wolff captures the contempt some Trump aides have for the president and his family.

So Wolff's liberties with off-the-record comments \u2014 while ethically unacceptable to nearly all reporters \u2014 have the effect of exposing Washington's insider jokes and secret languages, which normal Americans find perplexing and detestable. In the past year, we have had many of the same conversations with the same sources Wolff used. We won't betray them, or put on the record what was off. But, we can say that the following lines from the book ring unambiguously true: How Trump processes (and resists) information: \"It was during Trump's early intelligence briefings \u2026 that alarm signals first went off among his new campaign staff: he seemed to lack the ability to take in third-party information.\" \n \n \"Or maybe he lacked the interest; whichever, he seemed almost phobic about having formal demands on his attention.\" \n \n \"Trump didn't read. He didn't really even skim. ... [H]e could read headlines and articles about himself, or at least headlines on articles about himself, and the gossip squibs on the New York Post's Page Six.\" \n \n \"Some ... concluded that he didn't read because he just didn't have to, and that in fact this was one of his key attributes as a populist. He was postliterate \u2014 total television.\" \n \n \"[H]e trusted his own expertise \u2014 no matter how paltry or irrelevant \u2014 more than anyone else's. What's more, he had an extremely short attention span, even when he thought you were worthy of attention.\" Instinct over expertise: \"The organization ... needed a set of internal rationalizations that would allow it to trust a man who, while he knew little, was entirely confident of his own gut instincts and reflexive opinions, however frequently they might change.\" \n \n \"Here was a key Trump White House rationale: expertise, that liberal virtue, was overrated.\" Ill-preparedness: \"[T]he president's views of foreign policy and the world at large were among [his White House's] most random, uninformed, and seemingly capricious aspects. His advisers didn't know whether he was an isolationist or a militarist, or whether he could distinguish between the two.\" \n \n \"He was enamored with generals and determined that people with military command experience take the lead in foreign policy, but he hated to be told what to do.\" \n \n \"In the Trump White House, policy making ... flowed up. It was a process of suggesting, in throw-it-against-the-wall style, what the president might want, and hoping he might then think that he had thought of this himself.\" Low regard by key aides: \"He spoke obliviously and happily, believing himself to be a perfect pitch raconteur and public performer, while everyone with him held their breath. \n \n \"If a wackadoo moment occurred on the occasions \u2026 when his remarks careened in no clear direction, his staff had to go into intense method-acting response. It took absolute discipline not to acknowledge what everyone could see.\" \n \n \"At points on the day's spectrum of adverse political developments, he could have moments of, almost everyone would admit, irrationality. When that happened, he was alone in his anger and not approachable by anyone.\" \n \n \"His senior staff largely dealt with these dark hours by agreeing with him, no matter what he said.\" Be smart: More than half a dozen of the more skilled White House staff are contemplating imminent departures. Many leaving are quite fearful about the next chapter of the Trump presidency. \n \n 2.

This is a crucial part of any health care plan, and in the Sanders proposal, it is notably absent. \n \n So while the plan would certainly move the American uninsured rate from around 8.8 percent to nearly zero in theory, it\u2019s impossible to tell what it would take to get there and what the bigger economic picture would look like if we did. \n \n The Sanders bill includes an exceptionally generous benefit package \n \n Sanders\u2019s single-payer proposal would create a universal Medicare program that covers all American residents in one government-run health plan. \n \n It would bar employers from offering separate plans that compete with this new, government-run option. It would sunset Medicare and Medicaid, transitioning their enrollees into the new universal plan. It would, however, allow two existing health systems to continue to operate as they do now: the Veterans Affairs health system and the Indian Health Services. \n \n Those who do qualify for the new universal Medicare plan would get four years to transition into the new coverage. In the interim, they would have the option to buy into Medicare or another publicly run option that does not currently exist. \n \n Eventually, though, they would all end up in the same plan, which includes an especially robust set of benefits. It would cover hospital visits, primary care, medical devices, lab services, maternity care, and prescription drugs as well as vision and dental benefits. \n \n The plan is significantly more generous than the single-payer plans run by America\u2019s peer countries. The Canadian health care system, for example, does not cover vision or dental care, prescription drugs, rehabilitative services, or home health services. Instead, two-thirds of Canadians take out private insurance policies to cover these benefits. The Netherlands has a similar set of benefits (it also excludes dental and vision care), as does Australia. \n \n What\u2019s more, the Sanders plan does not subject consumers to any out-of-pocket spending on health aside from prescriptions drugs. This means there would be no charge when you go to the doctor, no copayments when you visit the emergency room. All those services would be covered fully by the universal Medicare plan. \n \n This too is out of line with international single-payer systems, which often require some payment for seeking most services. Taiwan\u2019s single-payer system charges patients when they visit the doctor or the hospital (although it includes an exemption for low-income patients). In Australia, people pay 15 percent of the cost of their visit with any specialty doctor. \n \n The Sanders plan is more generous than the plans Americans currently receive at work too. Most employer-sponsored plans last year had a deductible of more than $1,000. It is more generous than the current Medicare program, which covers Americans over 65 and has seniors pay 20 percent of their doctor visit costs even after they meet their deductibles. \n \n Medicare, employer coverage, and these other countries show that nearly every insurance scheme we\u2019re familiar with covers a smaller set of benefits with more out-of-pocket spending on the part of citizens. Private insurance plans often spring up to fill these gaps (in Canada, for example, vision and dental insurance is often sponsored by employers, much like in the United States). \n \n The reason they went this way is clear: It\u2019s cheaper to run a health plan with fewer benefits. The plan Sanders proposes has no analogue among the single-payer systems that currently exist. By covering a more comprehensive set of benefits and asking no cost sharing of enrollees, it is likely to cost the government significantly more than programs other countries have adopted. \n \n Would Sanders\u2019s health plan lower American health spending? It\u2019s hard to tell. \n \n One of Sanders\u2019s main arguments in favor of his health care bill is that American health spending is out of control and single-payer would rein it in. \n \n There are certainly policies in the Sanders plan that would reduce American health care spending. For one, moving all Americans on to one health plan would reduce the administrative waste in our health care system in the long run. \n \n American doctors spend lots of money dealing with insurers because there are thousands of them, each negotiating their own rate with every hospital and doctor. An appendectomy, for example, can cost anywhere from $1,529 to $186,955, depending on how good of a deal an insurer can get from a hospital. \n \n That doesn\u2019t happen in a single-payer system like the one Sanders proposes. Instead of dealing with dozens of insurers that set hundreds of prices, doctors only need to send bills to the federal government. \n \n One 2003 article in the New England Journal of Medicine estimates that the United States spends twice as much on administrative costs as Canada. A 2011 study in the journal Health Affairs estimates American doctors spend four times as much dealing with insurance companies compared with Canada. \n \n A single-payer health plan would have the authority to set one price for each service; an appendectomy, for example, would no longer vary so wildly from one hospital to another. Instead, the Sanders plan envisions using current Medicare rates as the new standard price for medical services in the United States. \n \n Medicare typically has lower prices than those charged by private insurance plans that cover Americans under 65. This suggests that switching to the Medicare fee schedule would be another policy change that would tug health spending downward. \n \n But there are forces in the Sanders plan that encourage higher health spending too. Its robust benefit package with no cost sharing would likely lead to more doctor visits and hospital trips. As the classic RAND Health Insurance Experiment found, patients respond to lower cost sharing in health care by seeking more treatment. Some of that treatment is necessary, but other services provided are not. \n \n And the Sanders bill would actually raise the prices currently paid by Medicaid, which covers about 50 million low-income Americans. Medicaid traditionally pays lower prices than Medicare and private insurance. If these patients were absorbed into the universal Medicare plan, their doctors would be paid more each time they were seen. \n \n We haven\u2019t seen a Congressional Budget Office score of the Sanders plan yet \u2014 and it\u2019s hard to know how these countervailing forces (some pushing health spending up and others forcing it down) would interact with one another to change overall health costs. \n \n The big question Sanders doesn\u2019t answer: how do you pay for it? \n \n The Sanders plan goes into great detail on what kind of coverage a universal plan ought to offer. But it does not do any work explaining how to pay for such a generous benefit package. \n \n A Sanders spokesperson said over email the office would release a set of financing options later Wednesday afternoon. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s nobody who has all of the answers,\u201d Sanders told my colleague Jeff Stein when asked about the financing of his health plan. \u201cNobody has all the answers. What I can say is we are going to be listing a number of revenue-raising proposals, which will generate more than enough money to pay for what we want to do.\u201d \n \n Eventually though, somebody will need to have those answers \u2014 and they\u2019re not easy to find. \n \n Financing the health care system that Sanders envisions is an immense challenge. About half of the countries that attempt to build single-payer systems fail. That\u2019s Harvard health economist William Hsiao\u2019s estimate after working with about 10 governments in the past two decades. Whether he is in Taiwan, Cyprus, or Vermont, the process is roughly the same: Meet with legislators, draw up a plan, write legislation. Only half of those bills actually become law. The part where it collapses is, inevitably, when the country has to pay for it. \n \n This is what happened when Sanders\u2019s home state of Vermont attempted to create a single-payer plan in 2014. Much like Sanders, local legislators outlined a clear vision of the type of health plan they\u2019d want to extend to all Vermonters. Their plan was arguably less ambitious; it did require patients to pay money when they went to the doctor. \n \n But Vermont\u2019s single-payer dream fell apart when the state figured out how much it would need to raise taxes to finance its new system. Vermont abandoned the government-run plan after finding it would need to increase payroll taxes by 11.5 percent and income tax by 9 percent. \n \n It\u2019s true \u2014 in Vermont and in the United States \u2014 that these increased taxes don\u2019t necessarily mean overall health spending is rising. It\u2019s entirely possible that health spending will go down as taxes go up, with Americans no longer spending billions on premiums for employer-sponsored coverage. \n \n Single-payer systems change who pays for health care, often shifting more of the burden onto wealthier individuals to create a more progressive system. The proposed 9 percent income tax in Vermont, for example, would be far more expensive for the $100,000 worker than the $30,000 earner. \n \n But who pays how much more is a key question this Sanders bill doesn\u2019t answer. Until there is a version that does, we can\u2019t know whether the health system the Vermont senator envisions could actually become reality. ||||| (CNN) When Sen. Bernie Sanders did this in 2013, he did it alone. \n \n On Wednesday, nearly four years later, Sanders introduced a new \"Medicare for all\" health care bill with a third of the Senate Democratic caucus by his side. \n \n Flanked at first by New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, Sanders called the costs of the current system \"insane and unaffordable,\" promising that the average family would benefit financially under his plan \"because you will no longer be writing checks to private insurance companies.\" \n \n For those whose taxes would go up, he added, \"that expense will be more than offset by the money are you are saving with the elimination of private insurance costs.\" \n \n Sanders said he planned to take the bill on the road to \"every state in the country and hear what the people have to say\" for a roving national workshop. But the outreach came with a warning. He fired a shot across the bow of Republicans likely to oppose the bill, saying the GOP had \"no credibility on the issue of health care.\" \n \n \"To my Republican colleagues, please don't lecture us on health care,\" Sanders roared to applause from the dozens of activists in the room. \"In the last few months, you, the Republican Party have shown the American people what you stand for\" by largely voting to dismantle Obamacare. \n \n Taking her turn, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren framed the push for single payer as the latest step in a long liberal project to expand access to medical care -- from Franklin Roosevelt's social security to Medicare and Medicaid under Lyndon Johnson and, most recently, Barack Obama's signature legislation. \n \n \"But we are here today to take another step,\" she said. \"We will not back down in our protection of the Affordable Care Act, we will defend it at every turn, but we will go further -- we will go further and we will say that in this country, everyone gets the right to basic health care.\" \n \n Before Sanders' remarks, supporters shared personal, often visceral accounts of doctors currently struggling to provide care and patients in need. An oncology nurse drew gasps in the room as she recounted the story of a cancer patient who could not afford to continuously empty the fluid building up in her lungs. The price of drainage bags, she said, was only covered in part by insurance, forcing the woman to ration her use. \n \n The legislation unveiled on Wednesday afternoon in Washington arrived a little more than six weeks after the party's all-hands fight to preserve Obamacare secured a narrow reprieve on the Senate floor . Sanders' plan, though dead-on-arrival in a Republican-controlled Congress, offers a blueprint for fundamentally reshaping the American health care system by moving the country to a government-run, single-payer program. \n \n Under Sanders' proposal, Americans would receive a \"Universal Medicare card\" that would be a ticket to comprehensive health care services, including hospital stays, doctor visits, substance abuse treatment, dental, vision and reproductive care -- including abortion. \n \n However, consumers may have to pay up to $250 out-of-pocket for prescription drugs, with incentives to use generic medications. Sanders, who's been vocal about lowering drug prices, would allow the government to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies. \n \n Long-term care, which Sanders had included in the version he unveiled during his presidential campaign last year, will not be covered. It will be addressed in separate legislation, an adviser to Sanders told CNN. \n \n The bill calls for the elimination of premiums for private health insurance, deductibles and co-pays. However, most Americans and businesses will pay what Sanders says is a much smaller share of their income to fund the program. \n \n While the new legislation has not yet been scored, the program Sanders pitched on the campaign trail came with an estimated annual price tag of nearly $1.4 trillion, to be paid for in part by a proposed new 2.2% income tax on all Americans, a 6.2% levy on employers and a further round of tax hikes on the wealthy. \n \n California Sen. Kamala Harris made the business-friendly case for single-payer. (Or, as one leftist activist in the room grumbled afterward, \"the neoliberal case.\") \n \n \"Let's give the taxpayer of the United States a better return on their investment,\" she said. \"Why? Because 'Medicare for all' stands for the proposition that all Americans from the day of birth, throughout their lives, will have access to health care.\" \n \n The talk on Wednesday was broad, with little mention of the financial mechanics needed to propel such a massive program. But Sanders' plan does address one of the stickier questions facing such proposals: how to phase out the current system, which depends primarily on employer-sponsored private plans, without creating a disruption in care. \n \n The answer, according to this new version of the bill, is to roll it out over a four-year transition period, a process Gillibrand and her office had a big hand in crafting. \n \n The law would beef up Medicare -- adding dental, vision and hearing aid coverage -- in its first year, while reducing the eligibility age to 55. Children, up to age 18, would also be offered immediate access to the government-run plan. Over the next two years, the Medicare age would drop to 45, then 35 years old. By the fourth year, everyone would be eligible. \n \n Despite the considerable legislative obstacles in its way, single-payer as a concept is gaining traction among the public. Some 53% of Americans support a national health care plan , according to a June poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation. That's up from 50% last year and from 40% between 1998 and 2000. \n \n It is also notably increasing in popularity with some of the most ambitious Democratic officeholders -- a group of Senators possibly looking to run for the party's presidential nomination in 2020. \n \n Harris was the first to announce plans to cosponsor the bill, followed by Warren. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Gillibrand made their plans public on Monday and Tuesday. The names, some expected, others less so, rolled in right up to a few hours before the event, when New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen announced her support. \n \n Notable absences, however, included Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein and the party's 2016 vice presidential nominee, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine. Of the latter three, all up for reelection in 2018, only Brown is expected to face a serious Republican challenge. \n \n Single-payer activists, mostly from the progressive grassroots movement that fueled Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign, are delighting in a sense of momentum after years stuck on the margins of the debate. \n \n \"This is an especially gratifying moment for the tens of thousands of nurses across the US who have dedicated years of effort to transform our health care system from an profiteering industry based on greed and suffering to patient need and healing,\" National Nurses United Executive Director RoseAnn DeMoro said in a statement. \n \n She called the bill's introduction a \"direct product of how Sen. Sanders made Medicare for all, and healthcare as a human right, such a signature issue of his campaign.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Bernie Sanders rolled out his vision to overhaul the health care system on Wednesday, one in which everybody would get their insurance from the government through Medicare instead of through their jobs or a private insurer. Sanders calls it the Medicare for All Act of 2017, but you'll also hear phrases such as \"single payer\" and \"universal health care\" used to describe it. One key part missing: details on how to pay for it, though Sanders plans to release a separate paper on that, reports the Wall Street Journal. Coverage: The basics: Per CNN, everybody gets a \"Universal Medicare card,\" which would be used to cover all health bills, from surgeries to dental care to substance abuse treatment. Co-payments would go away, and people would pay premiums based on their incomes, reports the AP. Private insurers would still exist, but for things such as elective plastic surgery or, sometimes, to act as middlemen between the government and hospitals or doctors. A 'right': Sanders makes his case in an op-ed in the New York Times. \"Guaranteeing health care as a right is important to the American people not just from a moral and financial perspective; it also happens to be what the majority of the American people want.\" 'Single payer': David Leonhardt of the New York Times has a Q&A on the fundamentals, including the basic question of what the term \"single payer\" means. In short, it \"describes a system in which only one entity\u2014the government\u2014pays medical bills. If all Americans had Medicare rather than insurance through their jobs, it would be a single-payer system.\" Vox says Sanders' system is far more generous than single-payer plans in Canada and elsewhere. The cost: This could cost hundreds of billions of dollars more per year, per the Journal. Details are yet to come, but Sanders envisions a progressive tax increase, with the wealthy paying more income, capital gains, and estate taxes, reports Newsweek. The senator says higher taxes for families would be offset by the fact that they no longer have to buy insurance. Still, in regard to single-payer systems, \"no one\u2014including Sanders\u2014has truly reckoned with how to pay for whatever system they might support,\" writes Mike Allen at Axios. Litmus test? By all accounts, the chances of it passing a GOP-controlled Congress are precisely 0%. But it's turning into a political litmus test of sorts for Democrats, reports the Washington Post. Sanders has the support of 15 Democratic senators so far, including all of those seen as potential 2020 presidential candidates. Co-sponsors include Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris. But many prominent Democrats are not on board, at least yet, including Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and those in tough re-election fights, reports Politico. The politics: No, this isn't going to pass, \"but here's the big question,\" writes Perry Bacon Jr. at FiveThirtyEight. \"Is it going to become one of the central goals of the Democratic Party and a defining feature of the campaign of whichever Democrat is the party's nominee in 2020?\" As of now, this \"seems very likely,\" as the Democratic party seems to be gravitating to the left. But Bacon lays out the political and policy reasons why Democrats might avoid \"becoming the party of single payer.\" Relishing the fight: Republicans see a chance to pounce. \"We welcome the Democrats' strategy of moving even further left,\" says Katie Martin, spokesperson for the Senate GOP's campaign organization, per the AP.",

Polls show that 60 percent of Americans say the federal government should be responsible for ensuring health care coverage for all Americans.

    "document": "For wannabe thieves, nothing is more tantalizing than an empty street and a vulnerable ATM. Soon, though, they could be facing more than just failure. Taking design cues from mother nature herself, researchers are building ATMs that fend off thieves with a spray of hot, steaming foam. \n \n The inspiration for this dastardly defense mechanism comes from none other than the bombardier beetle, which sprays near-boiling acid at any foes who coming knocking. It keeps the ingredients for its deadly concoction (hydrogen peroxide and hydroquinone) in two separate chambers in its abdomin. That way, the chemicals don't mix until they come shooting out, at which point the resulting reaction heats up and nearly vaporizes the noxious liquid. Here's our little friend in action. \n \n GIF \n \n Researchers at ETH Zurich University took cues from the deadly beetle and built two chemical filled honeycomb chambers. Except this time, hydrogen peroxide was paired with manganese dioxide. Since the two are only separate by a thin sheet of lacquer, any tampering will cause the chamber to break immediately, triggering a reaction that produces water vapor, oxygen, and heat.

What's more, researchers say that including DNA nanoparticles will allow them to trace the cash back to the source. Thieves may be able to run, but thankfully, it's getting much harder for them to hide. \n \n GIF \n \n Hopefully that barrier is thick enough to withstand the occasional (and inevitable( innocent, frustrated shake.

[Journal of Materials Chemistry via The Atlantic] \n \n Image: Getty Images/Sion Touhig ||||| The bombardier beetle inspired the researchers of ETH Zurich. (Photo: jayvee18 \u2013 Fotolia) \n \n Its head and pronotum are usually rusty red, and its abdomen blue or shiny green: the bombardier beetle is approximately one centimetre long and common to Central Europe. At first glance, it appears harmless, but it possesses what is surely the most aggressive chemical defence system in nature. When threatened, the bombardier beetle releases a caustic spray, accompanied by a popping sound. This spray can kill ants or scare off frogs. The beetle produces the explosive agent itself when needed. Two separately stored chemicals are mixed in a reaction chamber in the beetle's abdomen. An explosion is triggered with the help of catalytic enzymes. \n \n \u201cWhen you see how elegantly nature solves problems, you realise how deadlocked the world of technology often is,\u201d says Wendelin Jan Stark, a professor from the ETH Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences. He and his team therefore looked to the bombardier beetle for inspiration and developed a chemical defence mechanism designed to prevent vandalism \u2013 a self-defending surface composed of several sandwich-like layers of plastic. If the surface is damaged, hot foam is sprayed in the face of the attacker. This technology could be used to prevent vandalism or protect valuable goods. \u201cThis could be used anywhere you find things that shouldn't be touched,\u201d said Stark. In agriculture and forestry, for example, it could be used to keep animals from gnawing on trees. \n \n Like a fuse \n \n The researchers use plastic films with a honeycomb structure for their self-defending surface. The hollow spaces are filled with one of two chemicals: hydrogen peroxide or manganese dioxide. The two separate films are then stuck on top of each another. A layer of clear lacquer separates the two films filled with the different chemicals. When subjected to an impact, the interlayer is destroyed, causing the hydrogen peroxide and manganese dioxide to mix. This triggers a violent reaction that produces water vapour, oxygen and heat. Whereas enzymes act as catalysts in the bombardier beetle, manganese dioxide has proven to be a less expensive alternative for performing this function in the lab. \n \n The researchers report that the product of the reaction in the film is more of a foam than a spray when compared to the beetle, as can be seen in slow motion video footage. Infrared images show that the temperature of the foam reaches 80 degrees. Just as in nature, very little mechanical energy is required in the laboratory to release a much greater amount of chemical energy \u2013 quite similar to a fuse or an electrically ignited combustion cycle in an engine. ||||| Megan, a reader who voted for Hillary Clinton, shares a powerful confession: \n \n I\u2019ve been thinking about the election a lot for the past two days, and the idea that I keep coming back to is that in some ways this is my fault. \n \n It\u2019s my fault because I voted for Clinton when she ran against Obama in the 2008 primary, but I didn\u2019t tell anyone because she was the unpopular choice. I wasn\u2019t embarrassed about my decision, but being a real liberal seemed to mean voting for Obama. So I voted quietly in the primary, felt my disappointment quietly when she lost, and seamlessly joined the Obama supporters in the general election. \n \n It\u2019s my fault because I voted for Clinton when she ran against Sanders in the 2016 primary, and I didn\u2019t tell anyone because again she was the unpopular choice. She was even more qualified this time around and I had a greater appreciation for the depth of her public service, but being a real liberal seemed to mean supporting Sanders. So I voted quietly in the primary, and rarely mentioned my preference for her. \n \n It\u2019s my fault because during the long months of the primary and the general election I didn\u2019t tell anyone how strongly I felt about Clinton. I didn\u2019t put a sticker on my car, I didn\u2019t put a sign in my yard, and I didn\u2019t wear a T-shirt. My loudest statement of support was the tiny pin I purchased after the convention, at a time that it felt safe to be a Clinton supporter. \n \n It\u2019s my fault because when I ran into people who were voting for Trump\u2014at the grocery store, in the gym, in my neighborhood\u2014I changed the subject because I didn\u2019t want to get into an argument. I told myself that it wasn\u2019t worth it and that they wouldn\u2019t change their minds. \n \n It\u2019s my fault because though I knew my mother was genuinely torn between the two candidates I didn\u2019t engage with her. I didn\u2019t want to know that she actually thought there was a real choice to be made. \n \n It\u2019s my fault because I never once asked my sister what she was thinking. She\u2019d supported the Tea Party in the past, and I assumed she was leaning towards Trump. I didn\u2019t want to know. \n \n It\u2019s my fault because my father and I had a massive fight about Clinton over Easter, and in an effort to preserve our relationship I stopped talking to him about politics. If we didn\u2019t talk about it, then I didn\u2019t have to deal with the possibility that he was sexist and racist in a way I\u2019d never considered. \n \n It\u2019s my fault because I capitulated to the expectation that I not express my emotions publicly. I\u2019m upset right now, and it isn\u2019t lost on me that expressing this upset is potentially disqualifying. It isn\u2019t lost on me that saying I\u2019m angry will make me vulnerable to the accusation I\u2019m too emotional. I\u2019ve spent a lifetime calming down. It\u2019s something that I try to do when interacting with men professionally, and it\u2019s something that I try to do when I interact with men personally. And every time I do this in my private life, I normalize it and make it harder for women to succeed in public life. \n \n And it\u2019s also my fault because when I did support her, I did so in a provisional and caveated way. I said things like, \u201cI realize she\u2019s not a perfect candidate\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m not arguing that she isn\u2019t flawed.\u201d And every time I said something like this I affirmed that there was a need to apologize, I singled her out as somehow different from other candidates (in both parties) who were worthy of unequivocal support, and I created the space for the impression that she was critically flawed. I did this nearly every time I spoke about her, and I saw this language in dozens of articles and editorials and statements of support (including The Atlantic\u2019s editorial, though there doesn\u2019t appear to be similarly caveated language in the Lincoln or Johnson endorsements). In fact, I don\u2019t remember seeing this type of language in the editorials written for any of the similarly flawed men who have run for president over the past twenty years.

    "document": "(Reuters Health) - Gunshot-related deaths and injuries temporarily show a dramatic decline when the National Rifle Association is holding its annual convention, according to a new analysis in the New England Journal of Medicine. \n \n FILE PHOTO: An overall view of the exhibit floor at the National Rifle Association's (NRA) annual meetings and exhibits show in Louisville, Kentucky, May 21, 2016. REUTERS/John Sommers II \n \n The authors say it\u2019s evidence that firearms - even in the hands of experienced users - are inherently dangerous and accidents don\u2019t just happen among novices. \n \n Dr. Anupam Jena of Harvard Medical School and Andrew Olenski of Columbia University compared firearm injuries during the conventions each year from 2007 through 2015 with injury rates three weeks before and three weeks after each event. \n \n A decline of 63 percent was seen in the states where the conventions were being held, apparently due to large numbers of gun owners being at the events, as well as, in some cases, gun venues such as firing ranges or hunting grounds having closed while their staff attended the convention. \n \n Nationally, there was a 20 percent reduction in firearm injuries during the convention. \n \n In contrast, gun-related crime did not decrease during the conventions. \n \n The drop in injuries was only seen among men. It was most prominent in the states with the highest rate of gun ownership, and among people living in the South and the West. \n \n \u201cThese findings are consistent with reductions in firearm injuries occurring as a result of lower rates of firearm use during the brief period when many firearm owners and owners of places where firearms are used may be attending an NRA convention,\u201d they said. \u201cOur results suggest that firearm-safety concerns and risks of injury are relevant even among experienced gun owners.\u201d \n \n The NRA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n \n The study comes at a time when Americans own an estimated 265 million to 300 million guns, which is about one for every adult. Thirty percent of Americans say they own at least one gun, and another 11 percent say they live in a household with someone who owns one, according to the Pew Research Center. In 2014, 461 people died from an accidental firearm discharge and 15,928 were injured, nearly 2,000 of whom were children, the study authors note. \n \n \u201cThis passes the sniff test. It makes sense that decreased exposure and decreased usage would result in fewer events,\u201d said Dr. Stephen Hargarten, chairman of emergency medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin, in Milwaukee, who was not involved in the study. \n \n \u201cI have worked with lifetime members of the NRA who secretly confess that they have unintended discharges of their rifles or shotguns. And this study doesn\u2019t account for the unintended discharges that didn\u2019t result in injury,\u201d he told Reuters Health in a telephone interview. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re saying, \u2018Here\u2019s a brief period of time when people likely to use guns are not using them,\u2019\u201d and the injury rates go down, Jena told Reuters Health by phone. \n \n The researchers used an insurance database to track firearm injuries during conventions in Nashville, Indianapolis, Houston, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Charlotte, Phoenix, Louisville and St. Louis. \n \n Nationally, the rate of firearm injury dropped from 1.5 per 100,000 on the dates adjacent to the convention to 1.2 per 100,000 during the convention itself. And in the state where the convention was held, the injury rate went from 1.9 down to 0.7 per 100,000. \n \n With as many as 80,000 firearm owners attending a convention, \u201cthe relationship is not just possibly due to 80,000 members not using firearms as much during the date of the convention,\u201d Jena said. \u201cIt could be that firing ranges and hunting grounds are more likely to be closed. There could be a larger network effect that could be at play here.\u201d \n \n It\u2019s also relevant that the effect is largest in states that hold a meeting in a given year, he noted. \u201cIf the convention is closer to you in a given year, the effect should be larger, and we find that.\u201d \n \n During the NRA\u2019s Atlanta convention in 2017, 60 percent of the 81,000 NRA members traveled more than 200 miles to attend, according to the organization\u2019s 2018 convention website. \n \n \u201cI think the most sophisticated and reasoned gun supporters will not be surprised by this,\u201d Jena said. \u201cAll we are saying is that guns are inherently unsafe and you recognize that whenever you use a firearm. Even an experienced user may still suffer from a gun-related injury. That\u2019s like saying even the best drivers in the world may still get in a car accident. Why? Because driving is inherently an unsafe activity compared to walking around in circles in your house.\u201d \n \n It would seem reasonable to investigate ways to make guns safer, Hargarten said. \u201cWe\u2019ve integrated safety features into other products, but there has not been a collective discussion about this product, as we had with cars in the 1960s.\u201d \n \n SOURCE: bit.ly/2CKXQfa The New England Journal of Medicine, online February 28, 2018. ||||| Story highlights Gun-related injures go down by 20% during NRA conventions, new research shows \n \n The NRA calls the findings \"absurd\" and says the numbers \"simply don't add up\" \n \n (CNN) During National Rifle Association annual conventions, when about 80,000 gun owners spend a few days focused on seminars, events and meetings, America seems to be safer, new research suggests. \n \n More specifically, the rate of firearm-related injuries when NRA members gather en masse falls by 20% nationwide, according to a study published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine \n \n When a state hosted a convention, and presumably a higher percentage of local gun enthusiasts attended, gun-related injuries in that state fell 50%, said Dr. Anupam Jena, the study's senior author and an associate professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School. \n \n The Harvard-led researchers looked at the number of hospitalizations and emergency room visits tied to firearm injuries during convention dates and the three weeks before and after conventions. To reach their conclusions, they combed through nearly 76 million medical insurance claims filed by privately insured patients between 2007 and 2015. \n \n Injury reductions were most significant among men from the South and the West, where gun ownership -- and likely NRA membership -- is greater. \n \n Read More ||||| When gun enthusiasts gather for the National Rifle Association\u2019s annual conventions, rates of gun-related injuries and deaths drop by 20 percent nationwide\u2014and a whopping 63 percent in the hosting state\u2014according to an analysis published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine. \n \n Further Reading Making a different case for guns as a public health issue The finding was based on an analysis of insurance data on gun injury rates during NRA conventions from 2007 through 2015, as well as rates three weeks before and three weeks after each of the conventions. The researchers behind the work\u2014health policy expert Anupam Jena, MD, PhD of Harvard Medical School and economist Andrew Olenski of Columbia University\u2014also looked at crime rates during those times. \n \n They found no significant change in crime rates despite the dip in injuries. They also noted that the largest drops in firearm-related injuries during NRA conventions were in men, the southern and western areas of the country, and in states with the highest levels of gun ownership. \n \n Further Reading Researcher finds evidence that relaxing gun laws ups murder rate Though the analysis can only provide a correlation\u2014not causation\u2014Jena and Olenski suggest it may refute a common argument among gun proponents. That is, that gun accidents happen primarily in the hands of inexperienced users and that practice and training\u2014promoted by the NRA\u2014can greatly reduce or eliminate safety concerns and accidents, which affect thousands each year. In 2014, for example, there were 461 unintentional firearm deaths and 15,928 unintentional, non-fatal injuries, 1,960 of which involved youths. \n \n In their analysis, Jena and Olenski concluded that the findings: \n \n \u201c...are consistent with reductions in firearm injuries occurring as a result of lower rates of firearm use during the brief period when many firearm owners and owners of places where firearms are used may be attending an NRA convention. Our results suggest that firearm-safety concerns and risks of injury are relevant even among experienced gun owners.\u201d \n \n In a statement to CNN, NRA's director of public affairs, Jennifer Baker, called the study \u201cabsurd.\u201d She continued: \"This study is another example of when data and numbers fly in the face of logic and common sense.\u201d \n \n Baker went on to note that only a small fraction of the country\u2019s gun owners\u2014a group that totals about a third of Americans\u2014attend the NRA\u2019s annual conventions. She questioned how such a relatively small number of gun owners could explain such large decreases in injuries. \n \n In a response to CNN, co-author Jena emphasized that the study was not designed to explain the cause of the drops. But he speculated that gun owners who attend NRA conventions may be those who tend to use their guns more frequently than non-attending owners. \n \n Further Reading Connecticut gun controls estimated to have cut fatal shootings by 40% Moreover, he and Olenski noted a potential domino effect from the convention disrupting other group events or trips involving firearms and venues, such as shooting ranges and hunting grounds, where owners may temporarily close up to attend the convention. Last, the researchers noted that many NRA convention goers travel long distances to attend, potentially helping to explain the nationwide declines. For instance, 60 percent of the 81,000 NRA members attending the 2017 convention ventured more than 200 miles to get there. \n \n Other researchers were accepting of the analysis and its conclusions. Stephen Hargarten, chairman of emergency medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, was not involved in the study and told Reuters that it \u201cpasses the sniff test.\u201d Hargarten added that \u201cit makes sense that decreased exposure and decreased usage would result in fewer events.\u201d \n \n Nationally, the study found that baseline injury rates dropped from 1.5 per 100,000 people during control periods to 1.2 per 100,000 during NRA conventions. It also found that declines in injuries were larger within hosting states, dropping from 1.9 per 100,000 to 0.7 per 100,000 during the conventions. The conventions included in the study from 2015 back to 2001 were held in: Nashville, Indianapolis, Houston, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Charlotte, Phoenix, Louisville, and St. Louis. \n \n NEJM, 2018. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMc1712773 (About DOIs). ||||| The National Rifle Association and its allies have found their political influence under fresh scrutiny as gun control advocates push for new restrictions and corporations sever their ties in the wake of the deadly high school shooting last month in Parkland, Florida. But outside the gun control debate in Washington, membership in the NRA and gun rights groups across the country, which includes more than five million Americans, is spiking, according to people familiar with the numbers. \n \n The spike isn\u2019t a surprise, as such increases happen whenever people feel their Second Amendment rights are under threat, and many groups reported similar surges after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. But as gun control groups seek to use the anti-NRA backlash to mobilize their grassroots, recruitment this time seems to have taken on a more urgent tone. \n \n \u201cWake up people and see what\u2019s happening!!!!,\u201d Charles Cotton, a member of the NRA Board of Directors, wrote on a message board, TexasCHLforum.com, a site described as \u201cthe focal point for Texas firearms information and discussions, earlier this week. \u201c[Former New York Mayor Michael] Bloomberg and Hollywood are pouring money into this effort and the media is helping to the fullest extent. We\u2019ve never had this level of opposition before, not ever. It\u2019s a campaign of lies and distortion, but it\u2019s very well funded and they are playing on the sympathy factor of kids getting killed. If you really want to make a difference, then start recruiting NRA members every single day.\u201d \n \n \u201cThe NRA better be 15 million strong soon, or this is only going to get worse,\u201d Cotton, who didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, added on the message board. \n \n Representatives from over a dozen gun rights organizations and shooting associations in California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia told TIME they have seen membership rise since the Feb. 14 shooting left 17 dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. And two people familiar with the workings of the NRA, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to discuss membership numbers, said that since the shooting the NRA has also seen more people than usual join, renew memberships or donate money as President Donald Trump and other Republican Party leaders have signaled an openness to gun control policies that are anathema to the powerful group. A spokesperson for the NRA, which says on its website that it has more than five million members, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. \n \n Activists hold up signs at the Florida State Capitol as they rally for gun reform legislation in Tallahassee, Fla., on Feb. 26, 2018. Don Juan Moore\u2014Getty Images \n \n \u201cAs soon as anti-gun attacks started coming in on Twitter, Facebook, and in the media, we began to hear from people who didn\u2019t even own guns who wanted to join up or contribute out of solidarity in defense of the Second Amendment to the Constitution,\u201d said Patrick Parsons, who heads the Georgia Gun Owners, an independent gun rights organization in Georgia. Parsons said the group\u2019s membership, which he estimated at 13,000, had increased by 1,000 over the past two weeks, and that he had been \u201cworking around the clock taking calls, answering emails from interested people, sending out new member packets.\u201d \n \n Dudley Brown, the president of the National Association for Gun Rights, estimated his organization \u2014 which claims more than 4.5 million \u201cmembers and supporters\u201d on its website \u2014 estimated online membership applications at his organization could have grown by 30% over the last week, a number he expected to rise after Trump this week called for comprehensive gun reform legislation, including raising the age limit for buying certain weapons to 21. The Connecticut Citizens Defense League, which has a membership of almost 29,000 people, said it typically gets 15 or 20 applications a week, but received almost 200 in the last week. Gun Owners of America, which says it has 1.5 million members, amassed \u201chundreds\u201d of new members in the last week, according to an official at the organization familiar with membership numbers who spoke on condition of anonymity. The organization said it has seen it\u2019s membership grow by thousands since the Las Vegas shooting last October. Don Turner, the President of the Nevada Firearms Coalition and NRA member, estimated membership renewals and requests had increased by 20 percent at his organization since Parkland, although this is an increase he said he did not witness after the shooting in Las Vegas. \n \n \u201cGun owners themselves weren\u2019t being demonized [after Las Vegas]\u201d Turner explained. \u201cBut after the Florida shooting, there was a definite push to demonize honest gun owners and to demonize the NRA. And I think that\u2019s what\u2019s provoked their response.\u201d \n \n A model walks the runway during the NRA Concealed Carry Fashion Show in Milwaukee, on Aug. 25, 2017. Joshua Lott\u2014AFP/Getty Images \n \n Read More: With Gun Sales Down, the NRA Told Republicans It\u2019s OK to Talk About Gun Control \n \n After the deadly 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, when the gun control debate also reached a fever pitch, the NRA said it had gained 100,000 members in 18 days; NRA executive Wayne LaPierre announced that May that the organization\u2019s membership had reached 5 million, although that claim is impossible to independently verify since membership rolls and figures are not publicly released. NRA tax filings from 2013, published by ProPublica, show that in 2013, overall revenue increased by more than 35% from the previous year, with a nearly $10 million increase in contributions. Revenue from membership growth from 2012 to 2013 increased by nearly $70 million, and the percentage of membership dues contributing to total revenue growth increased from 42 percent to 50 percent, the tax filings show. \n \n Experts who closely watch gun rights groups said that while the NRA has remained silent about its membership numbers after the latest shooting, the rise in membership of other groups demonstrates the grassroots mobilizing power that is key to the NRA\u2019s influence. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a gun lobby, it\u2019s much bigger than that,\u201d said Scott Melzer, a sociology professor at Albion Colege who has spent almost a decade researching the NRA and is the author of Gun Crusaders: The NRA\u2019s Culture War. \u201cIt relies on the support of a very large and activist membership base, and that base and that movement is connected to the broader conservative movement.\u201d \n \n Gun rights activists said the membership increase is also fueled by a feeling that public rebukes such as corporations ending partnerships with the NRA are simply publicity stunts. \u201cThere is no one. NO ONE. Who joins the NRA for a discount on a rental car,\u201d Cleta Mitchell, an NRA member and former Oklahoma state lawmaker who sat on the NRA\u2019s board from 2002 to 2013, said in an email. She was referring to Hertz ending its discount program for NRA members. \n \n A general view of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School as staff and teachers prepare for the return of students in Parkland, Fla., on Feb. 27, 2018. Rhona Wise\u2014AFP/Getty Images \n \n \u201cYou can rest assured that the NRA will not lose a single member as a result of this,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cIf anything, it should spur people to join the NRA as a means of demonstrating that we who believe in the Second Amendment will not be bullied by these left wing multi-billion dollar corporations.\u201d \n \n Read More: Inside the Republican Party\u2019s New Direction on Gun Restrictions \n \n But as Cotton, the NRA board member, noted on the Internet forum, the spike in membership reported by these gun rights groups are are coming at the same time that some gun-control proponents are hoping the Florida shooting and the high-profile activism of the student survivors may finally push Congress to act. The gun-control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety said it has fielded inquiries from over 125,000 volunteers since the shooting, and received over $1.5 million in unsolicited donations in the immediate aftermath. And a new poll shows support for gun control in the country has reached its highest level in 25 years. So while these gun rights groups may be gaining members, it\u2019s ultimately unclear if that will make a difference. \n \n \u201cThe gun lobby is very good at marketing themselves and guns in the wake of mass shootings,\u201d said Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action. \u201cThey specialize in exploiting shooting tragedies. No, I\u2019m not surprised [about memberships increasing] but at the end of the day it doesn\u2019t really matter, because the vast majority of Americans support stronger gun laws and gun safety.\u201d",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It seems Americans are safest from gun-related injuries and deaths when thousands of gun owners are busy attending the NRA's annual convention, Ars Technica reports. An analysis published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine found gun-related injuries dropped 20% nationwide during annual NRA conventions between 2007 and 2015 and 63% in the states hosting the conventions. These reductions were seen despite no corresponding reduction in crime rates. The biggest drop in gun injuries was for men living in states with high levels of gun ownership in the South and West. \"The drop in gun injuries during these large meetings attended by thousands of well-trained gun owners seems to refute the idea that gun injuries stem solely from lack of experience and training in gun use,\" analysis author Dr. Jena Anupam tells CNN. Jennifer Baker, the director of public affairs for the NRA, says the analysis \"is another example of when data and numbers fly in the face of logic and common sense.\" But the chair of emergency medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin tells Reuters it \"passes the sniff test.\" \"It makes sense that decreased exposure and decreased usage would result in fewer events,\" says Dr. Stephen Hargarten, who wasn't involved in the analysis.

The two rounds that were fired sent passengers scattering in panic. The shot were heard by a special agent of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). The HSI office is about 150 feet from the shooting. \n \n The agent ran toward the gunfire, continued Miller, identified himself as a federal agent and ordered Moore to drop the gun. Moore turned toward the agent who fired, striking Moore in the upper body. At the same moment, Moore turned his own gun on himself and fired. Moore was dead at the scene. Inside a black suitcase next to where Moore was sitting, HSI, FBI and Houston PD found a black suitcase contains a Smith & Wesson AR15 assault weapon with a fully loaded magazine. \n \n In Moore's car, more .223 ammo for the weapon was found. Earlier in the day, Moore had posted on social media that he intended to commit a mass shooting today. A handwritten note found on Moore's body said he had changed his mind and wanted to kill himself. \n \n An autopsy will be conducted Friday. \n \n The terminal was closed immediately after the shooting. But later Thursday, parts of the terminal were reopened to passengers. The rest of the airport remained open after the shooting. \n \n Darian Ward, a spokeswoman for the Houston Airport System, said some passengers who were scheduled to leave from Terminal B were rerouted to other terminals. \n \n Dale Howard, of Tomball, was at the baggage handling area of the airport waiting for his sister to arrive on an incoming flight when he heard two shots fired from the floor above. A few seconds later, he said he heard three more shots. \n \n \"People were screaming. I knew exactly what it was \u0097 gunfire,\" Howard said. \n \n Police from an adjacent station rushed in, and Howard said he directed them to the floor above. \n \n Greg Newburn, who was in the terminal waiting for a flight to Oklahoma City, said he was sitting in a cafe area when he heard two gunshots and after a pause, several more. \n \n \"It seemed like quite a few shots. Everyone was scrambling, running left and running right, turning tables up and hiding behind tables. Nobody knew what was happening. I couldn't tell where the shots were coming from,\" he said. \n \n Newburn, from Gainesville, Fla., said it took him a few seconds to realize that the shots had come from the ticketing area, near the security checkpoint. ||||| The seed for this crawl was a list of every host in the Wayback Machine \n \n This crawl was run at a level 1 (URLs including their embeds, plus the URLs of all outbound links including their embeds) \n \n The WARC files associated with this crawl are not currently available to the general public. ||||| Page 1 of 1 \n \n UPDATE: Houston police just released this portion of Carnell Marcus Moore's suicide note that they say was written on Hotel Derek stationery: \n \n \n \n \"Here in the last hour, I yield to mercy when this could have turned bad.

It is unclear who fired the fatal shot. \n \n HPD spokesman Kese Smith said an armed male in his early 30s entered the airport and fired at least once into the ceiling just inside the doors of the terminal's pre-security departure area. \n \n Hearing the gunfire, a Homeland Security Investigations agent came out of his office and confronted Moore, ordering him to put down the gun, Smith said. \n \n When Moore refused the command, the officer pulled out his weapon and the man turned toward him, Smith said. \n \n The agent fired once, and Moore shot himself - apparently at the same time, according to Smith. Moore died at the scene. No one else was injured. \n \n Tricia Bentley, a spokeswoman for the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences, said an autopsy was expected to be performed on Friday. \n \n Hours after the shooting, officers were at Moore's home in Beaumont, carrying out computer equipment, a neighbor said. \n \n Marietta Kidd said she looked out a window toward the duplex where Moore lived and counted seven unmarked cars in her parking lot about the time school let out on Thursday. Kidd said her father owns the home and that her sister is Moore's neighbor. \n \n Kidd, who owns a beauty salon on the same street where Moore lived, said he had been in the duplex for several years and that he never talked much. \n \n Moore spoke of death on his Facebook page three times since Wednesday. \n \n 'When I go to meet God' \n \n The first status update was posted nearly 24 hours before he was killed. \"I recently had the chance of staring death in the face, and she was beautiful,\" he wrote at 1:26 p.m. Wednesday. \n \n About 12:45 a.m. Thursday, he proclaimed that \"This Life Will Crash Tomorrow!\" \n \n And about 12:42 p.m., he posted: \"45 minutes and 59 seconds in God's Shadow and Time Stops.\" \n \n His timeline also includes a video of a strained and sorrowful spoken word piece called \"When I go to meet God.\" \n \n The lyrics include: \"What makes a mother's son decide that death is better than tomorrow?\" and \"This is not a life worth living. I already ruined it.\" \n \n According to his Facebook profile, Beaumont was Moore's hometown, though he finished high school in a Georgia community south of Atlanta. He graduated from the heating, ventilation and air conditioning program at the Lamar Institute of Technology. \n \n 'He was a good guy' \n \n Colleagues remembered Moore as an affable and kind man. \n \n \"He was a friendly guy who talked to everybody,\" said Tim Knobloch, 29, one of Moore's tech school classmates in 2004 and later his co-worker at a Beaumont air conditioning company. \"He was a good guy.\" \n \n The shooting scene was chaotic, passengers and employees reported. \n \n Tina Gellinger, a 40-year-old Kansan who went outside between flights, was coming into Terminal B when she heard shouts to \"run!\" \n \n She and others scrambled toward elevators and hid behind walls as gunfire rang out. \n \n Nearby at the McDonald's in the food court, employee Tiffany Rigmaiden heard two shots, then shouting, then three more shots. The 23-year-old said a Transportation Security Administration agent running by told her and other workers to get down. Instead, they escaped through a back door and took an elevator to a lower floor. \n \n According to Houston Airport System spokeswoman Darian Ward, Houston police and the FBI \"interviewed quite a few people.\" She added that there was no \"visible damage\" to the facility. \n \n The incident also interrupted flights. \n \n Terminal B, where mostly smaller, regional jets land and take off, was shut down for hours. Incoming passengers were rerouted to enter through terminals C and E. At one point, a ground stop prevented planes from landing at Terminal B. \n \n Mike Glenn and Cindy George contributed to this report. Guiseppe Barranco reported from Beaumont.",

Beanies, fedoras, and \"other suitable hats\" \u2014 not bucket hats, sports caps, berets, or cowboy hats \u2014 are also permitted. \n \n Perhaps most notable, however, is that Starbucks workers are now allowed to \"make a statement with hair color,\" according to the company's press release, as long as dyed hair is permanent or semi-permanent (some temporary dyes, hair chalk, or glitter could be a food safety issue). \n \n Starbucks employees quickly took to social media to celebrate the change. \n \n Employees have been complaining about the coffee giant's hair policy for quite some time. \n \n \"Starbucks is place where partners are unique and should be able to show their true selves,\" reads a petition to change Starbucks' hair color policy on Coworker.org. \"How are they going to do it if they can't color their hair how they want?

Shorts, skirts, dresses and pants, including dark-wash jeans, are all part of the Starbucks wardrobe, and partners are invited to make a statement with hair color, so long as coloring is permanent or semi-permanent, in keeping with food-safety standards. To cap the look off, beanies, fedoras and other suitable hats are welcome. \n \n Related: Starbucks Dress Code Lookbook \n \n Some partners (employees) have already been wearing clothing that fits the new dress code guidelines. Customers coming into the Starbucks at the 47th & Broadway store in Manhattan last September immediately detected something different. Rather than the familiar solid black, white and khaki clothing underneath green aprons, baristas were decked out in a range of colors and outfits that reflected their own personal tastes. \n \n Visitors to the store were caught slightly off guard by the change, but they welcomed the new style, according to Starbucks store manager Mario Leon. \n \n \u201cCustomers noticed right away,\u201d Leon said. \u201cThey actually thought that something was wrong. They would ask me, \u2018Why are you guys all out of uniform?\u2019 And we just told them, \u2018No, this is the new uniform for this store.\u2019 They said, \u2018We like it.

It's extending shirt colors to gray, navy, dark denim and brown, plus patterns. Its partners can also wear shorts, skirts, dresses and pants, and go for any hair color they desire, so long as it meets food safety standards. The company had previously barred its employees from dyeing their hair unnatural colors, i.e. pink and purple, reports Fortune . \n \n The dress code is intended to be more reflective of what its baristas wear outside of work. \"This new dress code is what partners have in their closets,\" Starbucks store manager Mario Leon said in a press release. \"It just makes it so much easier.

It also builds on a growing trend of individual expression in the workplace. \n \n The company has been making a series of changes meant to benefit employees, notably through its college achievement plan and more recently its wage increase announcement set to go into effect in October.

Even before that, I was a huge fan of his work in the movies.\u201d \n \n Clinton went on to share how he admires the 30 Rock star\u2019s genuine interest in helping others, which he learned early on as a child from his Irish-Catholic family. Clinton also found it inspiring that Baldwin started making movies in his backyard when he was 5, and that his interest in politics began in elementary school when he ran for class president. It was cemented during his days in college. \n \n \u201cHe ended up going to George Washington University for two years, ran for student-body president, then came back home to New York where he followed a then-classic path, from politics into soap operas,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd now we know it works the other way around.

It\u2019s crazy,\u201d raved De Niro, who directed Baldwin in the 2006 drama The Good Shepherd. \u201cIt\u2019s great comedy and it\u2019s good for the country.

I thought I was retracing my footsteps to a road, but it suddenly dawns on me that this stretch of trees, underbrush and wild flowers doesn\u2019t look at all familiar. \n \n With a sudden surge of panic I cast around for a recognizable landmark. All I see are huge oaks, elegant beeches, crumbling, moss-enveloped stumps and patches of long grass. A sudden gust of wind stirs the branches and a few leaves drift slowly down to earth. A magpie lets out a mocking chuckle, then silence settles. I fight the urge to go rushing off blindly and try to think where I could have gone astray. After a moment spent composing myself, I decide on a route back through the trees, finally arriving at a wider path after ten minutes. \n \n This seems more hopeful and soon the distant sound of a fast-moving car tells me the road must be somewhere near. Speeding up in anticipation, I don\u2019t notice the three men until I have almost bumped into them. Silently they emerge from a copse of birch trees and one of them raises a hand for me to stop. From their camouflaged jackets and caps \u2013 not to mention their holsters and ammunition pouches \u2013 I presume they must be border guards. \n \n Here, on the northeastern edge of Poland, we are just a few kilometers from the boundary fence with Belarus and it is not unknown for people to try to slip into the European Union through Bialowieza. The four-hour drive from Warsaw has taken me through villages where head-scarved women herd cows along the main road, where freshly picked mushrooms are sold in lay-bys and where village elders sit on benches watching lorries clatter past on their way to all parts east and west. \n \n Good luck. They hide well. \n \n But that is not at the forefront of my mind as I give an apologetic smile and try out my best Londoner\u2019s Polish. \u201cDzien dobry. Szukam droga Bialowieza? (Hello. Which way is Bialowieza?)\u201d The leader inclines his head and replies in English: \u201cOver there. Left on the road.\u201d He looks me up and down. \u201cEnglish?\u201d I nod. \u201cBirdwatching?\u201d I shake my head: \u201cI\u2019m hoping to see Zubr (bison).\u201d He nods: \u201cGood luck. They hide well.\u201d \n \n He is right, but the task is made easier if you enlist the help of an expert. The next day I return to the forest, this time in the company of Tomasz Kaminski, a biologist at Poland\u2019s Mammal Research Institute. Guided by Tomasz\u2019s compass, map and seemingly limitless forest knowledge, we move further and further into the thick trees and undergrowth of this long-standing national park in search of survivors of an age when giant mammals roamed the continent. Tomasz, an expert in bison behavior, is weighed down by a heavy-looking, hand-held aerial that is receiving signals from one of a few individuals that has been fitted with a radio collar. Thanks to this we are gradually homing in on our quarry. \n \n As we push on, Tomasz describes his job. \u201cI spend a lot of time gathering data about the bison \u2013 so I\u2019m out in the forest most days. They\u2019re the largest terrestrial animals in Europe and they\u2019re absolutely fascinating creatures, especially as \u2013 even somewhere like this \u2013 they\u2019re living in a place that\u2019s heavily influenced by people and is a mixture of forest and farmland.\u201d \n \n Suddenly, he stops. \u201cBison\u2026 Bison,\u201d he whispers, pointing towards a stand of sun-dappled beech and maple trees. Even through binoculars I cannot see anything but foliage, tree trunks and shadows. Then something moves. One of the shadows has a tail. A group of five or six bison is grazing among the trees. Despite their massive size, standing at least two meters at the shoulder, measuring around three meters long and weighing around 800kg, they are almost silent and their dusty grey flanks provide near-perfect camouflage among the trunks. \n \n Every time I see them I\u2019m amazed \n \n We watch in rapt silence for more than ten minutes as the bison gradually move down a gentle slope, before slowly disappearing once again into the forest.\u201d Every time I see them I\u2019m amazed,\u201d says Tomasz reverently. \u201cThey were saved from extinction and now they live in freedom in a large European country like Poland. It just shows how flexible they are as a species.\u201d \n \n There are now around 800 bison in the forests here, around 480 on the Polish side of the border and more than 300 on the Belarusian. Things could have been very different, though. The bison came within a whisker of extinction in eastern Europe in the 20th century. Bialowieza was once a royal hunting ground \u2013 its name harks back to the \u2018white tower\u2019 of a local hunting lodge \u2013 and it was a popular venue for the kings of Poland and, later, the Russian tsars. \n \n Those crowned heads viewed the bison as a most desirable quarry and that somewhat dubious honor ensured the species survived for centuries \u2013 albeit at a cost that today seems a high one. An aged, grey obelisk on the outskirts of the forest provides a reminder of those times. In swirling, ornate script it records the day in 1752 when a hunt led by King Augustus III of Poland accounted for 42 bison (including six calves), 13 elk and two roe deer. \n \n Tsar Nicholas II was another who enjoyed the thrill of the chase here. He had tracks created that would allow him to speed unheard through the forest aboard a troika, letting him take up a position from which to bring down the unsuspecting wildlife. World War I, however, not only proved fatal for the tsar, it was disastrous for the bison of Bialowieza \u2013 which were hunted to extinction by hungry soldiers and civilians alike. \n \n Descended from just seven ancestors \n \n By the early 1920s there were just 54 European bison left in the world. A select few from European zoos were introduced into the national park and their descendants have been here ever since, even managing to survive throughout World War II. But there is an enduring issue that is hard to overcome \u2013 a shallow gene pool. The bison here are descended from just seven ancestors. \n \n Returning from my modern version of a hunt, I find out more about the realities of reintroduction from naturalist Dr Krzysztof Niedzialkowski, whom I meet at the quiet, modern headquarters of the Mammal Research Institute in Bialowieza village. \u201cThat low genetic diversity could have a negative effect,\u201d he says, \u201cso we have to monitor the situation regularly and try to diversify the population as much as we can.\u201d \n \n One way of doing that may be by expanding the bisons\u2019 range so that, instead of one big population, there are a number of separate groups. Such a move helps guard against disease, an outbreak of which could be disastrous among such a genetically similar population. \u201cIn winter, the bison are fed with hay at various places in the forest \u2013 it\u2019s a tradition that dates back around 300 years,\u201d says Krzysztof. \u201cIt helps ensure the animals eat well in winter, but we end up with large concentrations of bison that provide potential for the spread of parasites and disease. It can also contribute to more aggressive behavior.\u201d \n \n As many as 50 animals are shot each year \n \n And there is another controversial issue associated with feeding the animals in winter. It makes survival easier and that can lead to an excess of numbers. Rare as the European bison is, the park authorities feel they have to enforce a cull \u2013 and that means as many as 50 animals are shot each year, a practice that is strongly questioned by many, outside the park authorities. After all, it is an animal more rare than the black rhino. Those carcasses are then used for meat and fur, but, argue some ecologists, the forest ecosystem would benefit if nature was allowed to take its course, not only in selecting which animals should die, but also in leaving their bodies to sustain other species \u2013 foxes, wolves and others \u2013 especially during the winter months. \n \n To gain some more insights on the issue I talk to Staffan Widstrand, award-winning photographer and a founder and managing director of the mass communication initiative, Wild Wonders of Europe. Staffan is focusing increasingly on re-wilding initiatives and how these can be successfully achieved. \u201cAs human beings we\u2019re obsessed with the management of nature; thinking that if we don\u2019t manage it things will go terribly wrong. But we should be treating nature more like an adult, not like a sick child.\u201d \n \n \u201cFor an example, you need only look at the exclusion zone around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine and Belarus. There are an amazing number of large herbivores there now; nature seems to be doing quite OK on its own without any management from people.\u201d \n \n And Chernobyl is not the only place in the region where human tragedy has brought an unexpected benefit for nature. Some 470km south of Bialowieza, on the border with Ukraine and Slovakia, Poland\u2019s Bieszczady National Park owes its origins to the forced resettlement of many of its ethnic Ruthenian inhabitants by the Soviet authorities in the years immediately after World War II. In 1973 the area was officially designated a national park and today measures around 30,000 ha, with a further 30,000 ha of managed forest on its borders. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much the only place in Europe with the full range of species \u2013 if you exclude the two that are extinct \u2013 the aurochs [wild cattle] and the tarpan [wild horse],\u201d says Staffan. \u201cThe wildlife is incredible: wolf, lynx, bear, bison, moose, red deer and roe deer all live there.\u201d \n \n Legal hunting and poaching is a problem \n \n For all its diversity, though, the current situation at Bieszczady also raises some issues regarding the wider possibility of rewilding in Europe. The park borders on to national parks in Ukraine and Slovakia and in both of these legal hunting and poaching is a problem. On the Polish side \u2013 as at Bialowieza \u2013 there is also officially sanctioned hunting to limit populations of herbivores. Staffan says: \u201cWhat typically happens is that in winter the animals move down from the higher altitude national park area to the managed forests where it isn\u2019t as cold. Then they run a high risk of being shot as part of a policy to keep down numbers.\u201d \n \n For ecologists such as Staffan such a philosophy seems ill-founded at best. \u201cForestry managers at Bieszczady say they have the \u2018optimum\u2019 number of animals in their forests. They\u2019ve decided that\u2019s four deer per hectare \u2013 if there are more than that they start eating the young trees and if there are more than 10 they start eating bark \u2013 which can kill fully-grown trees. But perhaps their ecological role is exactly that \u2013 to kill trees and to create a more open, less wooded landscape. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s part of a wider problem in Europe generally. Many national parks are managed by state forestry companies so many of the people involved have a forestry background. To them, protecting a forest means protecting trees. For an ecologist a forest is an eco-system that includes animals and dead trees. If the animals bring down trees ultimately to create a mosaic of woodland and grassland then that\u2019s fine.\u201d \n \n The bison, for example, though now associated with dense forest, has only been forced into such areas to escape the activities of mankind. Says Staffan: \u201cThese animals are serious grass eaters and there is not much of that within an old-growth forest, so they go out into neighboring farmland in search of it and that doesn\u2019t make the farmers very happy.\u201d \n \n The challenge is to find such places in Europe \n \n In a bid to avoid such issues, the national park authorities at Bialowieza have considered corridors of habitat complete with feeding stations that lure the bison to alternative areas of forest. But in the end, the only real solution may be to create large, open, wild grassland areas in which large herbivores can live in extensive social herds. The challenge is where to find such places in Europe. Bialowieza ecologist Krzysztof Niedzialkowski says: \u2018\u201cBison aren\u2019t always seen positively by neighboring communities and occasionally there are problems. We have had cases of individual animals moving into inhabited areas and becoming more and more accustomed to people.\u201d \n \n One bison, he adds, began approaching cows in farmers\u2019 fields and was responsible for some minor attacks. Ultimately, the animal had to be shot. Environmentalists such as Krzysztof would like to see the area of Bialowieza national park increased, to allow for more wildlife-friendly management and boost the area\u2019s tourism potential. Such ideas, however, may not be well received by local communities who believe their access to the forest might be reduced and forestry jobs may be lost. \n \n Both Polish and Belarusian forests are part of the same Unesco World Heritage site and the long-term hope is that a larger, zoned park could be created with separate areas primarily dedicated to wildlife, commercial forestry and recreation. That still leaves one problem, however. Currently, the border fence that divides Poland \u2013 not to mention the rest of the EU \u2013 from Belarus runs straight through the forest, splitting it in two and separating two populations of bison that, combined, would have more genetic diversity. That fence is unlikely to come down any time soon. \n \n For now, the way to enter Belarus \u2013 provided your paperwork is in order \u2013 is via a pedestrian crossing manned by serious-looking soldiers with red stars on their berets. A few hundred meters away from the gate there is little to suggest I have changed countries or political systems. The forest is every bit as impressive as on the other side of the border; huge fungi sprout from fallen tree trunks and ferns grow in abundance around pools colored an almost psychedelic green by algae and moss. During World War II, this area became a base for Polish and Soviet partisans, who would attack German army supply lines and then disappear among the trees. A merciless war was fought here and occasional memorials to its victims provide a reminder that the area was not always as tranquil as it is today. \n \n Bialowieza is popular with bird watchers \n \n Entering a clearing I disturb a family of wild boar, the adults a surprising shade of black, the piglets a lighter, dappled brown. With a remarkable turn of speed they are gone almost before I have time to register their presence. Overlooking the scene is a tall wooden tower that offers a useful vantage point. In this perch it is easy to see why Bialowieza is so popular with bird watchers. A group of goldfinches, with yellow flashes on their wings and bright red faces, chatter noisily in a nearby ash tree; pink and black long-tailed tits bob through the lower branches and a duo of buzzards circle away to the west. \n \n Up here it is hard to imagine that the vast majority of the forest has been actively managed for at least 100 years. But there is an exception to this rule. One strictly protected area on the Polish side, though, measuring 4,747 hectares, has remained virtually untouched throughout the centuries. This fragment is perhaps all that remains of the primeval lowland forest that once covered vast tracts of Europe. It has an ecosystem to match, with wolves, red deer, lynx, elk and beaver all present \u2013 as well as numerous smaller creatures. \n \n Back in Poland some hours later, and comfortably positioned in the restaurant of the modern Hotel Bialowieski, I meet Mateusz Szymura, a national park ranger. As we each demolish a steaming bowl of solyanka \u2013 a traditional soup made with salted ham, sausage, cabbage and carrots and garnished with sour cream and dill \u2013 he explains more about this primeval survivor. \u201cThe forest has existed here for 10,000 years \u2013 since the last Ice Age,\u201d he says. \u201cThen, in the medieval period, when many areas were being cleared for farming \u2013 this place became a royal hunting ground. The bison was declared a species that only kings could hunt. In those days, the kings of Poland also controlled Lithuania and this area was a good stopping off point between their courts in Krakow and Vilnius.\u201d \n \n After a second course of pierogi (small dumplings stuffed with minced pork) and a Zubr beer \u2013 its green, white and gold label adorned by the image of a bison \u2013 we take a hike from the village, past meadows that are rapidly transforming into birch woods, towards the immense trees that mark the tract of truly ancient forest. Inside, it is easy to imagine the age of some of the trees by the sheer size of their trunks, while the thick canopy brings with it a crepuscular shade and thick, moss-cloaked branches, slowly rotting, sprawl across the ground. \u201cPeople are often surprised by how untidy the forest looks,\u201d says Mateusz, \u201cbut a fallen tree is home to perhaps 1,000 species. When it was living that same tree housed maybe 100. So you shouldn\u2019t really call it dead wood, it\u2019s still living.\u201d \n \n The forest is far from impenetrable \n \n Full of life and darkly mysterious it may be, but the forest is far from impenetrable. The ground cover is nowhere near as thick as I expected \u2013 and for obvious reasons: deer and wild boar eat seedlings and shrubs, and the spreading leaves of those giant trees cuts off sunlight from reaching the ground. The only time the canopy is breached is when one of the giants falls. And therein lies a subject for discussion, adds Mateusz. The strictly protected area where we are standing forms but a tiny fragment of the larger national park that lies within an overall tract of forest covering 150,000 hectares \u2013 62,500 in Poland, 87,500 in Belarus. Commercial foresters often have a different understanding of what constitutes good practice than national park wardens. \n \n This debate has in recent years surfaced in the shape of what to do with a creature called the bark beetle, Dendroctonus micans, which, while it may look insignificant, can over time bring down a 50m-high spruce tree. Conventional forestry wisdom involves either felling infected trees and quarantining areas of forest or introducing a predatory beetle called Rhizophagus grandis to provide a biological solution to the problem. If you are preserving a forest as a primeval relic untouched by humanity, however, you cannot offer up solutions that involve chainsaws and alien species. \u201cThe bark beetles are part of the natural process,\u201d says Mateusz. \u201cYes, they will kill some trees, but they won\u2019t kill them all \u2013 that\u2019s not in their interest. Also \u2013 and very importantly \u2013 when an old tree falls, it opens up a big gap where young trees can flourish \u2013 ultimately helping the forest regenerate. The beetles are part of nature \u2013 there\u2019s no such thing as a pest here.\u201d \n \n The afternoon sun is painting the foliage a mellow, golden hue and all is quiet in the forest, the silence broken only by the sound of faintly rustling branches. Suddenly, not very far away, a red deer begins to roar out a challenge \u2013 a deep, throaty growl that sounds as if it could belong to some sort of fierce primeval creature. \n \n I am glad my friend knows these paths and trees so well \u2013 it might not be a good idea to lose your way. \n \n Sharing is caring",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Conservationists are expressing outrage after an official in Germany ordered hunters to shoot the first wild bison seen in the country in more than two centuries. Calling the killing a criminal offense, the World Wildlife Fund says it will file charges against the official who gave the order, the Local reports. \u201cAfter more than 250 years a wild bison had been spotted again in Germany and all the authorities could think to do is shoot it,\" says Chris Heinrich, a WWF board member. The bison was seen by the river Oder near the eastern town of Lebus on Wednesday. Thinking the beast was a threat to public safety, a local official sent a pair of hunters to take care of it. It was unclear if any of them knew the European bison is classed as a \"vulnerable\" species and on Germany\u2019s list of \"strongly protected animals.\" The victim was likely a bull that had wandered across the border from Poland from its home in a national park. While they may be the continent's largest land mammals, weighing up to 2,200 pounds, the bison are not considered dangerous. If they were, says the local environmental minister, then \"half of Poland, where the animal is a national symbol, would have to be declared a danger zone.\" Hunted to near extinction in Europe in the early 20th century, the bison are making a comeback thanks to conservationists, with more than 1,200 now roaming around Poland, per the Telegraph, which published a video showing bison fleeing, then standing up to, a pack of wolves. (The US bison is the country's first national mammal.)",

    "document": "SEATTLE \u2014 A plan by Facebook to acquire a broad range of patents through a deal with Microsoft is on its surface yet another twist in the battles over intellectual property engulfing the tech business. \n \n But the subtext of the deal is a different story, showing how two of technology\u2019s most powerful players are teaming up to create a greater balance of power on the Internet \u2014 a market that has been tilted decisively in favor of one company, Google, for years. \n \n \u201cThis is almost certainly a move against Google,\u201d said Rebecca Lieb, an analyst at Altimeter Group, a research firm. \n \n The agreement between Microsoft and Facebook, announced on Monday, came less than two weeks after Microsoft agreed to pay more than $1 billion for 925 patents held by AOL. In a second deal, Microsoft said it had turned around and sold 70 percent of those same patents \u2014 about 650 in all \u2014 to Facebook for $550 million in cash, along with rights to 275 AOL patents Microsoft plans to retain. \n \n While Facebook and Microsoft have not yet determined precisely how they are going to divvy up the patents, it is expected that Facebook will end up with a range of patents involving mobile, Web and instant messaging technologies. \n \n Microsoft is likely to keep AOL patents involving search, among other things. \n \n The arrangement will help Facebook bulk up its intellectual property portfolio before its initial public offering, which is expected next month, and it is a further sign of the growing importance of stockpiling patents in the arsenal of any big technology company. \n \n \u201cThis is another significant step in our ongoing process of building an intellectual property portfolio to protect Facebook\u2019s interests over the long term,\u201d Ted Ullyot, general counsel of Facebook, said in a statement. \n \n The deal could also give Facebook additional ammunition in its escalating patent feud with Yahoo. \n \n Yahoo sued Facebook earlier this year, claiming violations of Yahoo patents, many related to online advertising. Facebook subsequently countersued Yahoo, in a pattern that is playing out again and again in different parts of the technology business, especially the mobile phone market. \n \n But in large part the deal is evidence of how Microsoft and Facebook have gravitated ever closer to each other in part because of a common enemy, Google. \n \n Google has menaced Microsoft\u2019s business on a number of fronts, including with free online Google applications that compete with Microsoft Office and with Android, a mobile operating system that competes with Microsoft\u2019s Windows Phone software. \n \n As Facebook has evolved into a Web behemoth, with 900 million active monthly users, Google has become increasingly focused on tamping down the challenge to its business from the social network, introducing Google Plus, a rival social service. Google\u2019s big concern is that the bounty of data Facebook has about its users, including their tastes and friend connections, will turn it into a serious rival for online advertising dollars. \n \n There is also wide speculation that Facebook will start its own Internet search engine to rival Google. \n \n \u201cMicrosoft is simply less concerned about the threat of social to its business than Google is,\u201d said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Gartner, a research firm, explaining why Microsoft is not concerned about competition with Facebook. \n \n \u201cThis may be a case of the enemy of my enemy is my friend,\u201d he added. \n \n Jim Prosser, a Google spokesman, declined to comment. \n \n Microsoft has spent the last several years forging deeper connections with Facebook at every turn. Long stymied in its efforts to create an Internet search engine that effectively competed against Google, Microsoft two years ago struck a deal with Facebook to use data from the social network in Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine to create more relevant search results. But the arrangement has not helped dislodge Google from its position of supremacy in Internet search. \n \n Years before that, Microsoft tried to acquire Facebook, but the social network\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, rebuffed the offer. Those conversations subsequently led to Microsoft\u2019s taking a small stake in Facebook, from which it stands to profit handsomely after the company goes public. \n \n In March, Google accounted for 66.4 percent of Internet searches in the United States, unchanged from the same month a year earlier, while Microsoft was in second place with 15.3 percent of the market, according to comScore. \n \n Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine also supplies search results for Yahoo, which accounted for 13.7 percent of the search market during March. \n \n Microsoft has continued to lose money on Bing, including more than $2.6 billion in operating losses for its online division during its last fiscal year. \n \n Some executives within Microsoft have advocated selling Bing to another company, with the idea that a company better focused on the Internet market could pose a more credible challenge to Google, according to severalpeople with knowledge of the discussions who didn\u2019t want to be identified talking about internal deliberations. \n \n Over a year ago, Microsoft executives sent out feelers to Facebook to see if the company would be interested in acquiring Bing, though the overture was not officially sanctioned by Steven A. Ballmer, chief executive of Microsoft, one of these people said. \n \n Mr. Zuckerberg declined, saying Facebook had too much else to concentrate on. Dawn Beauparlant, a spokeswoman for Microsoft, declined to comment, as did Ashley Zandy, a spokeswoman for Facebook. \n \n In its original patent deal with AOL, Microsoft either bought or won the ability to assign about 925 patents and patent applications, along with a license to several hundred other patents AOL did not sell as part of an auction of its intellectual property. \n \n If the deal announced Monday clears regulatory scrutiny, Microsoft would still own about 275 AOL patents and retain a license to the 650 patents that Facebook will own. In addition, Microsoft is granting Facebook a license to the 275 AOL patents that it is keeping. \n \n Yahoo\u2019s legal attack on Facebook came at a sensitive time, as the company nears an expected initial public offering. \n \n In a statement, Yahoo said the deal with Microsoft will not deter its lawsuit against Facebook. \n \n \u201cNothing about today\u2019s action changes the fact that Facebook continues to infringe our patents,\u201d Yahoo said in the statement. \u201cCompanies who purchase patents are often working from a position of weakness and take these actions to strengthen their portfolio. We see today\u2019s announcement as a validation of our case against Facebook.\u201d \n \n The deal with Facebook puts Microsoft in an awkward position since it could help strengthen one close partner at the expense of another, Yahoo. \n \n \u201cWe are very sensitive to the importance of our relationship with both Facebook and Yahoo,\u201d Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s general counsel said in an interview. \u201cWe have enormous respect for the value of the Yahoo patent portfolio. Yahoo has been an important innovator in the Internet space.\u201d ||||| Summary: Facebook is acquiring the majority of the patents Microsoft just acquired from AOL. Facebook will thus soon own over 1,000 patents. This deal is really all about another company: Yahoo. \n \n Update - Yahoo: Facebook\u2019s AOL patent deal with Microsoft show it is weak \n \n As expected, Facebook and Microsoft today announced Menlo Park will pay Redmond $550 million for a portion of the 925 U.S. patents and patent applications it recently acquired from AOL for $1.056 billion. Microsoft will assign to Facebook the right to purchase 650 patents and patent applications of the total, plus a license to the AOL patents and applications that Microsoft will purchase and own. The news was broken by Bloomberg, which was subsequently followed by a press release sent out by both Facebook and Microsoft. \n \n I say \"as expected\" because I wrote the following just a few days ago: \n \n Here's the interesting part. Microsoft reportedly intends to sell most of the newly acquired portfolio because it doesn't consider all of the 800 patents valuable to its patent portfolio. In other words, Facebook could still get some of the patents it was after. After all, the two companies are more friends than enemies. \n \n While the 800 estimate is no longer valid, everything else is. Microsoft will retain ownership of approximately 275 AOL patents and applications, a license to the approximately 650 AOL patents and applications that will now be owned by Facebook, and a license to approximately 300 patents that AOL did not sell in its auction. \n \n Facebook will meanwhile get the 650 patents or so that it was after. Facebook will not, however, get a license to the 300 patents AOL still retains and which Microsoft has licensed. To license those 300 patents, Facebook will have to go directly to AOL. If it's interested, Facebook will do just that. \n \n \"Today's agreement with Microsoft represents an important acquisition for Facebook,\" Ted Ullyot, general counsel at Facebook, said in a statement. \"This is another significant step in our ongoing process of building an intellectual property portfolio to protect Facebook's interests over the long term.\" \n \n So, what does this mean? Well, first of all I can update the number of patents that Facebook will soon own to over 1,000. Late last month, I counted Facebook owned some 812 patents. With this Microsoft deal, Facebook has almost doubled that number. \n \n More importantly though, these patents will likely end up being a big part of the social networking giant's current and future patent lawsuits. Facebook has been slowly looking to beef up its patent portfolio, but with public companies like Yahoo and Mitel targeting it for patent infringement, Menlo Park has stepped up its game. \n \n I don't believe it's a coincidence that AOL and Yahoo are such similar companies. Both are/were online giants, and both have been superseded by Facebook. There is no doubt in my mind that this is exactly why Facebook is so interested in AOL's patents: a lot of them cover technologies that Facebook uses, and the rest likely cover technologies used by companies that want to sue or are already suing Facebook. \n \n As such, I believe Facebook's lawyers are already going through the patents and deciding which ones will be most useful in helping the social networking giant fight back against patent trolls. This is the main reason Facebook is buying these patents from Microsoft. \n \n Facebook's most recent patent purchase was some 750 patents from IBM. Soon Facebook will own 650 more AOL patents, and it's all thanks to Microsoft. \n \n Speaking of which, in a post last month (\"Should Microsoft save Facebook from Yahoo?) I said Microsoft would not directly help Facebook: \n \n Microsoft and Yahoo have a patent sharing deal through their 2009 search agreement, which has been extended till 2013. There may not be anything legally stopping Microsoft from helping Facebook, but the software giant's partnership with Yahoo is no joke. Microsoft cares about growing Bing, and it needs Yahoo to fight Google. Of course it needs Facebook to fight Google as well, but somehow I don't think Microsoft wants to jeopardize either of its partnerships. Maybe Redmond will advise Menlo Park and Sunnyvale on what to do, but I don't think it will take action. Microsoft will probably just sit back and hope they'll work it out. \n \n I was wrong. Only after Microsoft bought AOL's patents and the rumor about Facebook being interested in some of those patents, did I connect the dots. Microsoft found a very clever way to give Facebook a boost, while still getting what it wants (the remaining patents), without damaging its relationship with Yahoo. \n \n Maybe I'm just stubborn, but I would still argue Microsoft is not \"directly\" helping Facebook. On the other hand, I'll be the first to admit that this is probably the best indirect help Facebook can get. \n \n Since day one, I thought Yahoo suing Facebook was a stupid move and Sunnyvale should reconsider. Then Facebook countersued Yahoo. Now, more than ever, I think Sunnyvale should settle. \n \n Update - Yahoo: Facebook\u2019s AOL patent deal with Microsoft show it is weak \n \n See also:",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Earlier this month, AOL agreed to sell Microsoft 925 patents and patent applications for just north of $1 billion; now another tech giant is getting a piece of the action. Facebook has pledged to buy some 650 of those patents, or $550 million worth. In the deal, Facebook also gets a license to Microsoft's portion of the portfolio. According to Facebook's announcement, Microsoft ends up with 275 AOL patents, plus licenses to Facebook's AOL patents and the 300-ish patents AOL didn't sell. \"Today\u2019s agreement with Facebook enables us to recoup over half of our costs while achieving our goals from the AOL auction,\" says a Microsoft rep. For Facebook, it's \"another significant step in our ongoing process of building an intellectual property portfolio to protect Facebook\u2019s interests over the long term,\" says a spokesman. What do outsiders say? \"The deal is a further sign of the growing importance of stockpiling patents in the arsenal of any big technology company,\" writes Nick Wingfield for the New York Times. \"It also shows how Microsoft and Facebook have gravitated increasingly closer to each other in large part because of a common enemy: Google.\" Writing for ZDNet, Emil Protalinski says it's actually all about Yahoo, not Google. \"With public companies like Yahoo targeting it for patent infringement, the social networking giant has stepped up its game.

The biggest online intellectual property story last week was the shutdown of a website offering downloads of the cartoon My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, which shook the burgeoning \"brony\" community to its core. \n \n \n \n Bronies (bro+pony) are adult male fans of the new series launched in 2010 based on the classic \u201880s My Little Pony toy that [spoiler] your mom secretly threw out your collection of when you went to college. \n \n \n \n If you think bronyism sounds like something only a serious pervert living in his mother's basement would be into, you're only about 30% correct. To address your immediate question: it's not ironic. It's nerdy guys who genuinely enjoy an animated series about ponies. The show has a legitimate appeal to older audiences\u2014high production values, snappy dialog, and a heartwarming message. But the online fan culture of bronies grew out of 4chan, so they have a computer nerd vestigial tail of Mountain Dew, anime appreciation, chronic virginity, and cyberbullying. \n \n \n \n Bronies have their own news sites, fan forums, and even a healthy amount of fan art of ponies doing unspeakable sexual acts on Tumblr. They've had real life meet-ups, and an upcoming BronyCon in New York will feature appearances by voice actors from the show. \n \n In the pecking order of internet weirdo subcultures, bronies fall somewhere between Ron Paul supporters and furries. For this reason, I like to do a search for \"bronies\" on Twitter every now and then to see if there's anything worth ironically retweeting. It was while doing this search that I stumbled onto the piracy scandal unfolding between trademark holder Hasbro and a popular brony site. \n \n Until last week, PonyArchive.org was a keystone of the Brony community. The fan site offered free full episodes of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, and had around 30,000 visitors a week. PonyArchive's videos were much higher quality than YouTube, making it the best destination for fans who didn't want to buy episodes on iTunes or wait for the DVD release in February. It also serviced international fans who couldn't access the show on TV or iTunes in their country. \n \n \n \n It turns out giant international corporations don't love it when you pirate their content, even if the words \"friendship\" and \"magic\" occur in its title. On December 14, Hasbro sent a take-down notice to PonyArchive.org. PonyArchive, which was based in Sweden, did not comply, and sent this email reply, reposted on BronyNews: \n \n Thanks for your consern [sic]. Since we are merely spreading friendship and magic we feel that we're protected by princess Celestia herself. Also, we are not based in the US - so US law does not apply to us. Please feel free to download the episodes from our website in order to \n \n learn about accepting, friendship and happyness too. Have a nice one :) \n \n But Hasbro did not want to learn about accepting or happyness. They sent a second notice, and by December 20th, PonyArchive relented and removed all content from the site except this message under the heading \"Fuck you, Hasbro\": \n \n \n \n Dear Celestia, \n \n \n \n Today we learned that Hasbro, are no real bros. They are indeed proper wankers. \n \n \n \n We were only trying to spread the word that friendship is magic, and then these twats came along with their fancy threat-letters. \n \n \n \n Please, banish HasNObro to the hell-holes forever. \n \n \n \n Yours truly \n \n Pony Mc Archiveington \n \n (According to the Friendship Is Magic wiki, Princess Celestia is a \"winged unicorn, the supreme ruler of Equestria\"\u2014the world of My Little Pony.) \n \n \n \n These harsh words sparked a rift in the brony community. Had PonyArchive reacted immaturely, or was it a justified response to a snub by Hasbro? EquestriaDaily, the most popular brony blog, had 844 comments on its post about the crack-down. \n \n \n \n Most commenters were anti-PonyArchive: \n \n \n \n \"Being a brony, I am ashamed to be associated with people that choose to answer in such an arrogant and self-entitled manner. It's childish, that's what it is. The last thing this fandom need are people like this.\" \n \n \n \n \"Not cool, PonyArchive. You're failing to love and tolerate the very people who introduced the love and tolerate rule. Shame...\" \n \n \n \n Other bronies were just disappointed the site was gone, especially bronies in other countries: \n \n Ponyarchive is down. Guess I'll just use The Pirate Bay. It's not like I can buy the DVDs or any episodes from iTunes. \u2014 Anonybrony (@Anonybrony) December 21, 2011 \n \n PonyArchive's official response in the comments? \"Well, we did this for teh lulz.\" \n \n \n \n Illegal torrents of episodes are still out there for motivated bronies and international fans, and there's little chance bronies are going away anytime soon. Right or wrong, one thing is clear: Don't get between a man and his Ponies. \n \n Katie Notopoulos is the creator of the blogs Sorry I Missed Your Party, Dumb Tweets at Brands, and Marina Abramovic Made Me Cry. She's on Twitter, duh. ||||| Today's My Little Pony is totally different from what you grew up with in the '80s, and it isn't just that you're no longer interested in brushing a plastic pony's mane for hours. When the franchise was rebooted last year with the TV show My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, it developed an unlikely fanbase: \"Bronies,\" or adult male fans. Like an animated, girls' version of Bridesmaids (with less diarrhea jokes, presumably), the series proves that men will watch a high-quality program targeted to women, even if it's overloaded with pink and sparkles. \n \n The New York Observer tells the unlikely tale of how the charming 4chan cesspool inspired a legion of men to begin following the adventures of characters like Twilight Sparkle and Rainbow Dash. Shortly after the show (which, true to its origins, still exists in part to sell Hasbro toys) premiered on The Hub in October, an article about the show was posted on the 4chan comics and cartoons message board /co/. According to fan Nanashi Tanaka, \"We were going to make fun of it, but instead everybody got hooked. And then the first pony threads exploded.\" \n \n Soon the mostly-male commenters, who developed the term Brony from \"bro pony,\" were posting about the show thousands of times a day, and even taking their discussion of Applejack and Pinkie Pie's latest exploits to the infamous /b/ board. Big-eyed, pastel-colored cartoon ponies who talk about friendship are the antithesis of everything /b/ stands for, and thus a civil war broke out on the boards. The denizens of /b/ fought back against the influx of ponydom with bannings and the usual photos of hardcore sex acts and dead things, which would traumatize the average internet user for life. According to Know Your Meme, the Bronies adopted a surprising mantra: \"I'm gonna' love and tolerate the shit outta you.\" Fans responded to hate by calmly working around bannings and posting even more pony pictures, enraging their /b/ opponents even further. Eventually things died down when the creator of 4chan acknowledged the popularity of ponies on the boards. Says fan Sam Levine: \n \n \"My Little Pony is the only group to take on 4chan and win. 4chan once took on the F.B.I. and won. So you might say that My Little Pony is more powerful than the F.B.I.\" \n \n The show's first season ended last month and by now Bronies have moved on to other Pony-centric fansites. Many say they're not ready to share their love of My Little Pony with the world yet, and not just because it's girly. In fact, though male Bronies have drawn the most attention, the Observer estimates that about a quarter of adult fans are women. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Understandably, fans of both genders don't want to advertise to everyone at work that they create fan art, post YouTube parodies, and collect merchandise related to a children's show. Bronies say they're drawn to My Little Pony because the plots, characters, and animation rise above the level of your average kids' show \u2014 and that's exactly what creator Lauren Faust intended. Faust was a writer and storyboard artist on The Powerpuff Girls and wanted to make another show children and adults could enjoy. Though, she recently told Wired she never expected this response: \n \n \"This might be a little short-sighted on my part, but I just assumed that any adult man who didn't have a little girl wouldn't even give it a try ... The fact that they did and that they were open-minded and cool enough and secure in their masculinity enough to embrace it and love it and go online and talk about how much they love it - I'm kind of proud.\" \n \n The Hub has embraced Bronies in it's marketing, and hopefully other executives are taking note. They key to a successful children's program isn't churning out increasingly stereotyped shows in which girls pretend to be princesses and frolic with woodland creatures while boys fight and play with cars (or fight with robots that turn into cars). Men aren't allergic to everything aimed at women, and with interesting characters and plots (and a dose of '80s nostalgia) people of all ages, and genders, are likely to become fans. \n \n Advertisement \n \n With such high praise for the show, you might want to check out the first episode for yourself on YouTube.

Four unsold pucks were also recovered from a safety deposit box. \n \n Records show Lawrence also set off the metal detector more often than any other employee, but that subsequent checks with a wand did not set off alarms. \n \n The Mint says it since improved its internal security measures. \n \n Additional information- sources ||||| The former Royal Canadian Mint employee who apparently used his rectum to smuggle 22 solid gold \"pucks\" out of the secure facility in Ottawa has been given a 30-month prison sentence and must pay a fine of $190,000. \n \n In November, 35-year-old Leston Lawrence was found guilty of stealing the 22 pucks from the mint on Sussex Drive, and of laundering 17 of them through Ottawa Gold Buyers (the cheque for an 18th puck never cleared because that puck was seized by police). \n \n Lawrence was also found guilty of possession of property obtained by crime, conveying gold out of the mint and breach of trust by a public official. \n \n Ontario Court Justice Peter Doody ruled Thursday that Lawrence would have to serve an additional 30 months if he doesn't pay the $190,000 fine within three years of being released from prison. \n \n The weight of the 17 laundered pucks ranged from 192 to 264 grams apiece and were sold for between $6,800 and $9,500 each in 2014 and 2015. \n \n Lawrence made $130,000 from the 17 pucks he sold, which he sent abroad to build a house in Jamaica and buy a boat in Florida, among other transactions. The full market value of the 17 pucks of gold is estimated to be about $190,000, according to a statement of restitution prepared by the mint in early January. \n \n It's estimated that if Lawrence had managed to sell all 22 pucks through Ottawa Gold Buyers, Lawrence would have made about $165,000 \u2014 an amount based on what he sold the 17 pucks for. \n \n Crown wanted 3 years, defence wanted 18 months \n \n During sentencing submissions last month, Crown attorney David Friesen said Lawrence should be sentenced to three years in prison, arguing that the offences took place over several months and were \"not simply a one-off,\" and that Lawrence has not demonstrated remorse. \n \n The Crown was also seeking a $190,000 fine. \n \n Defence lawyer Gary Barnes, meanwhile, said his client should receive an 18-month jail sentence, arguing lax security measures made it easy for Lawrence to smuggle the gold and that he's already lost his job. \n \n Barnes also argued Lawrence should only have to pay back $130,000 \u2014 the amount he actually made selling the 17 pucks of gold \u2014 rather than the $190,000 the 17 laundered pucks are estimated to be worth. \n \n Defence lawyer Gary Barnes says the judge in the gold smuggling trial was meticulous. 1:27 \n \n 'Accepts that he has been convicted' \n \n Speaking to reporters outside court Thursday, Barnes called Doody's decision careful and meticulous, and said it was \"difficult to quibble with what he had to say.\" \n \n Lawrence is reacting \"very well\" to the media interest in the case, Barnes said, and accepts the outcome of the trial. \n \n \"We expected it all along. ... When no one showed up for the first week and we were sort of under the radar, that was very, very surprising,\" Barnes said. \n \n \"He's sitting there looking at what the judge has done ... and he accepts that he has been convicted.\" \n \n Barnes also reiterated that the mint's security measures were too lax. \n \n Mint responds \n \n In an emailed statement, a mint spokesperson wrote Thursday that \"several improvements\" have been made to their security system, \"including upgrades to our facility's security checkpoint and screening process; upgrades to our camera system to high definition which provides real-time monitoring capability in all areas of the mint; and working closely with CATSA [Canadian Air Transport Security Authority] to establish more robust scanning training of our employees. \n \n \"The mint is one of the most secure facilities in Canada and we are confident that we have the right security measures in place to effectively operate our business,\" the statement reads.",

    "document": "A Ford logo (Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images) \n \n The company that put Americans in cars affirmed Wednesday that those vehicles are going the way of the Model T and it will focus ever more on trucks and SUVs. \n \n Ford, during its announcement Wednesday that it had a first-quarter profit of $1.7 billion, said its traditional car lineup soon will be trimmed to just the Mustang and a new Focus Active crossover that comes out next year. \n \n By 2020, nearly 90% of Ford's product lineup in North America will be trucks, SUVs and commercial vehicles. \n \n For the first quarter, the Dearborn automaker said it earned 43 cents per share, beating Wall Street analysts' average expectations by 2 cents per share. \n \n Ford's revenue worldwide increased 7% to $42 billion for the quarter. The 9% increase in quarterly profit can be almost entirely attributed to a drop in the automaker's effective tax rate to 9% from 28.6%, Ford officials said. \n \n The automaker's pretax profit fell 14% from a year ago to $2.2 billion for the quarter. \n \n Read more: \n \n Ford also unveiled plans to pare an additional $11.5 billion in costs between 2019 and 2022. These reductions would come on top of the $14 billion in cuts that the automaker previously announced in the fall. \n \n The latest planned reductions will come from areas including engineering, materials costs, marketing and sales. \n \n Ford Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks told reporters it is too early to say whether the additional cuts and \"efficiency opportunities\" would result in layoffs or staffing reductions. \n \n CLOSE Ford Motor Co. unveiled its new Ford Focus compact car in China and Europe on Tuesday Detroit Free Press \n \n \u201cWe have looked at every single part of the business,\" Shanks said. \"It\u2019s a little bit of everything, and I don't think they\u2019re done yet.\u201d \n \n Additionally, Ford said it expects to put $5 billion less into capital expenditures from 2019 to 2022 than it once anticipated. \n \n Shanks said that rising costs for commodities, such as aluminum, steel and copper, were a nearly $500-million drag on Ford's performance for the quarter. For the year, higher commodity costs are expected to be a $1.5-billion \"head wind,\" Shanks said. \n \n Ford\u2019s decision to pull back on car production reflects a shift in consumer sentiment that has had an impact across the automotive industry. \n \n The full-size Taurus, midsize Fusion, small Fiesta and wagon-like C-Max will no longer be sold in North America, Ford officials said. Exactly when these models will stop being sold in the market hasn't been announced. \n \n In 2016, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced it would end production of the Dodge Dart and Chrysler 200 to focus even more on SUV and trucks. The company, which does still produce some car models, shuffled production and preserved factory jobs. It is seeing sales grow at its Jeep brand, with vehicles such as the Compass SUV and a new Wrangler. \n \n Michelle Krebs, executive analyst at AutoTrader.com, said Ford\u2019s move is no shock. \n \n \u201cFord\u2019s announcement to pretty much get out of the car business ... comes as no surprise. Ford\u2019s car sales have been dismal for the past couple of years, and there\u2019s no end in sight to the decline of traditional cars,\u201d Krebs said. \n \n 2019 Ford Fusion sedan (Photo: Ford Motor Company) \n \n Dave Sullivan, manager of product analysis for AutoPacific, Inc., called the move bold but also not surprising. \n \n \u201cThis might be the boldest move Ford has made in many years as they pin their hopes on future products that no one has seen,\" he said. \"Obviously, this has done well for brands such as Subaru. The competition isn't standing still and we'll see more jacked up cars, wagons, and crossovers on the market every few months for the next few years.\" \n \n In North America, Ford's biggest market, the automaker's pretax profits were down $200 million to $1.9 billion. Shanks said the higher commodity prices were largely to blame. \n \n Europe was the only other region where Ford was profitable \u2014 a $149-million pretax profit. Ford reported losses of $149 million in South America, $119 million in the Asia/Pacific region and $54 million in the Middle East and Africa. \n \n Contact JC Reindl: 313-222-6631 or jcreindl@freepress.com.

According to its latest financial release, the auto giant \u201cwill transition to two vehicles\u201d \u2014 the Mustang and an unannounced vehicle, the Focus Active, being the only traditional cars it sells in the region. Ford sees 90 percent of its North America portfolio in trucks, utilities and commercial vehicles. Citing a reduction in consumer demand and product profitability, Ford is in turn not investing in the next generation of sedans. The Taurus is no more. \n \n The press release also talks about a new type of vehicle, though it sounds like a crossover. This so-called white space vehicle will \u201ccombine the best attributes of cars and utilities, such as higher ride height, space and versatility.\u201d \n \n Currently, Ford sells six sedans and coupes in North America: the Fiesta, Focus, Fusion, C-Max, Mustang and Taurus. This lineup hits multiple segments, from the compact Fiesta to the mid-size Focus, C-Max and Fusion to the full-size Taurus. The Mustang stands alone as the lone coupe. \n \n It\u2019s likely Lincoln\u2019s sedans will also disappear, though this was not explicitly stated in today\u2019s press release. Lincoln currently sells the mid-size MKZ and full-size Continental \u2014 both share platforms with Ford counterparts. If Ford is phasing out development of sedan platforms, Lincoln will likely suffer, too. \n \n This reduction in traditional cars was a long time coming. North America consumers have increasingly turned to crossovers, trucks and SUVs over sedans and small cars. A trip to any parking lot will likely produce more evidence to this movement. There are several factors involved, from more fuel-efficient and better-equipped trucks and SUVs to improved safety ratings and ride qualities of these vehicles. \n \n Ford also today reaffirmed its commitment to bringing hybrid-electric powertrains to the F-150, Mustang, Explorer, Escape and upcoming Bronco. \n \n This announcement comes several weeks after Ford explained in broad terms its love affair of trucks and SUVs. Ford estimates that SUVs could make up as much as half the entire U.S. industry\u2019s retail market by 2020, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s shifting $7 billion in investment capital from its cars business over to the SUV segment. By 2020, Ford also aims to have high-performance SUVs in market, including five with hybrid powertrains and one fully battery-electric model. \n \n With this big hybrid push on the SUV side, Ford expects to go from second to first-place in the U.S. hybrid vehicles market by sales, surpassing current leader Toyota by 2021, thanks also to the forthcoming hybrid Mustang and F-150. \n \n The sedan was long a staple for Ford. The Lincoln Continental defined the \u201960s. And then there was the Ford Galaxy, which was available in countless variations for nearly 20 years. Then in the \u201980s came the LTD, Crown Victoria and Taurus. Ford even went rally racing with its cars, namely the Escort and later Focus. But while all these nameplates rose and fell, there was another always present: The Mustang. \n \n Ford\u2019s little pony turned 54 in April 2018. The Mustang has been in production since 1964 and seems ready for yet another generation of drivers. The car has been reinvented several times and will likely be reinvented several more before its nameplate is retired. For now, though, the Mustang is here to stay.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Some 110 years after the first Model T rolled off the line, Ford has decided to start phasing out car sales. The company announced Wednesday that it \"will not invest in next generations of traditional Ford sedans for North America.\" In a financial release, Ford said that it plans to transition to just two cars over the next few years: the Ford Mustang and the new Ford Active, a \"crossover\" vehicle to be released next year. Ford currently sells the Fiesta, Focus, Fusion, C-Max, Mustang, and Taurus sedans and coupes in North America reports TechCrunch, which notes that the Lincoln sedans are also expected to vanish. Ford hasn't said exactly when the Taurus and other models will be phased out, but the company's statement says almost 90% of its North America portfolio will be trucks, utilities, and commercial vehicles by 2020. Auto industry experts say the move is a bold one, but not totally unexpected, given the continuing shift among consumers away from cars and toward SUVs. \" Ford\u2019s announcement to pretty much get out of the car business ... comes as no surprise,\" says analyst Michelle Krebs, per the Detroit Free Press. \"Ford\u2019s car sales have been dismal for the past couple of years, and there\u2019s no end in sight to the decline of traditional cars.\"",

The full-size Taurus, midsize Fusion, small Fiesta and wagon-like C-Max will no longer be sold in North American, Ford officials said. In 2016, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced it would end production of the Dodge Dart and Chrysler 200 to focus even more on SUV and trucks.

It is the latest in a series of statement footbridges around the world. Cau Vang (meaning gold bridge) opened in June, is 150 metres long and 1,400 metres above sea level, with views across the green mountainscape. It took just under a year to construct, with initial designs by TA Landscape Architecture. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Cau Vang (Golden Bridge), Ba Na Hills, Vietnam. Photograph: Amazing Things in Vietnam \n \n The Ba Na hills mountain retreat was a favourite holiday location for the ruling French authorities in the early 20th century but fell into ruin after the revolution against colonial rule in 1945. The area is now home to a replica French village and gardens, along with a 5.8km cable car track \u2013 once the world\u2019s longest and highest \u2013 as well as a cavernous concrete amusement complex, hidden beneath the kitsch-looking village. Remnants of the original villas have been spotted by travellers riding the cable car. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Courtesy of Amazing Things in Vietnam. \n \n Cau Vang follows in a line of unusual footbridges, seen everywhere from Iowa to India: structures that are noteworthy as architectural statements in themselves, rather than accessories for an already popular location. \n \n In 2014, the Fan Bridge was unveiled in Paddington Basin in London. It currently only operates Wednesdays and Fridays at noon and Saturdays at 2pm, leaving it somewhere between the practical and the artistic. The hydraulic structure, designed by Knight Architects, positions its five steel beams 20 metres across the water, rising in a similar way to a traditional Japanese fan. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Fan Bridge at dusk, Paddington Basin, London.

Photograph: Imaginechina/Rex/Shutterstock \n \n At the opposite end of the technology scale are the sustainable footbridges made by the Khasi people from living, natural resources in the gorges of Meghalaya, north-west India. The living root bridges are deep in the tropical forest, close to village of Mawsynram, the wettest place on earth. The most famous, the Umshiang Double Decker Living Root Bridge, took 15 years to craft into its current form. The practice itself is thought to be 180 years old, with the bridges built from rubber tree roots nurtured for years to hold human weight. This material is a preferable alternative to wood here, which decays during the monsoon season. \n \n Parting the sea might sound like an impossible act but how about building a permanent pathway through water? The Moses Bridge in the village of Halsteren, in North Brabant, Netherlands, acts like a dam under the waterline, holding the moat on either side. The \u201csunken\u201d bridge, crafted from pre-treated, rot-resistant wood, was designed by Ro & Ad Architects to provide access to a 17th-century Dutch fort. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Moses Bridge, Halsteren, the Netherlands. Photograph: Alamy \n \n Decades of lovers have transformed a once relatively unremarkable-looking bridge in Serbia, now known as Most Ljubavi \u2013 one of the earliest versions of a love bridge. Legend has it that Nada, a teacher, would meet her army officer lover Relja on the bridge to pledge their love \u2013 but he left her during the first world war and she subsequently died of a broken heart. It is thought to have become famous thanks to a poem, Prayer for Love, written by Desanka Maksimovi\u0107 in the 1990s. Couples now visit the \u201cBridge of Love\u201d to attach inscribed padlocks to it. The practice for good luck in love now takes place on bridges around the world. \n \n The modern, tubular Webb Bridge connects in Melbourne\u2019s South Wharf with the Docklands area, and was designed by sculptor Robert Owen and engineered in 2003 by Arup \u2013 the company behind the Sydney Opera House.

The nuclear power plant affected by a massive earthquake is facing a possible meltdown,... (Associated Press) \n \n At least for the time being. \n \n The chain of events started Friday when a magnitude-8.9 earthquake and tsunami severed electricity to the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear complex 170 miles (270 kilometers) northeast of Tokyo, crippling its cooling system. Then, backup power did not kick in properly at one of its units. \n \n From there, conditions steadily worsened, although government and nuclear officials initially said things were improving. Hours after the explosion, they contended that radiation leaks were reduced and that circumstances had gotten better at the 460-megawatt Unit 1. But crisis after crisis continued to develop or be revealed. \n \n Without power, and without plant pipes and pumps that were destroyed in the explosion of the most-troubled reactor's containment building, authorities resorted to drawing seawater in an attempt to cool off the overheated uranium fuel rods. \n \n Robert Alvarez, senior scholar at the Institute for Policy Studies and former senior policy adviser to the U.S. secretary of energy, said in a briefing for reporters that the seawater was a desperate measure. \n \n \"It's a Hail Mary pass,\" he said. \n \n He said that the success of using seawater and boron to cool the reactor will depend on the volume and rate of their distribution. He said the dousing would need to continue nonstop for days. \n \n Another key, he said, was the restoration of electrical power, so that normal cooling systems can be restored. \n \n Officials placed Dai-ichi Unit 1, and four other reactors, under states of emergency Friday because operators had lost the ability to cool the reactors using usual procedures. \n \n An additional reactor was added to the list early Sunday, for a total of six _ three at the Dai-ichi complex and three at another nearby complex. Local evacuations have been ordered at each location. Japan has a total of 55 reactors spread across 17 complexes nationwide. \n \n Officials began venting radioactive steam at Fukushima Dai-ichi's Unit 1 to relieve pressure inside the reactor vessel, which houses the overheated uranium fuel. \n \n Concerns escalated dramatically Saturday when that unit's containment building exploded. \n \n It turned out that officials were aware that the steam contained hydrogen, acknowledged Shinji Kinjo, spokesman for the government Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency. More importantly, they also were aware they were risking an explosion by deciding to vent the steam. \n \n The significance of the hydrogen began to come clear late Saturday: \n \n _Officials decided to reduce rising pressure inside the reactor vessel, so they vented some of the steam buildup. They needed to do that to prevent the entire structure from exploding, and thus starting down the road to a meltdown. \n \n _At the same time, in order to keep the reactor fuel cool, and also prevent a meltdown, operators needed to keep circulating more and more cool water on the fuel rods. \n \n _Temperature in the reactor vessel apparently kept rising, heating the zirconium cladding that makes up the fuel rod casings. Once the zirconium reached 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit (1,200 Celsius), it reacted with the water, becoming zirconium oxide and hydrogen. \n \n _When the hydrogen-filled steam was vented from the reactor vessel, the hydrogen reacted with oxygen, either in the air or water outside the vessel, and exploded. \n \n A similar \"hydrogen bubble\" had concerned officials at the 1979 Three Mile Island nuclear disaster in Pennsylvania until it dissipated. \n \n If the temperature inside the Fukushima reactor vessel continued to rise even more _ to roughly 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,200 Celsius) _ then the uranium fuel pellets would start to melt. \n \n According to experts interviewed by The Associated Press, any melted fuel would eat through the bottom of the reactor vessel. Next, it would eat through the floor of the already-damaged containment building. At that point, the uranium and dangerous byproducts would start escaping into the environment. \n \n At some point in the process, the walls of the reactor vessel _ 6 inches (15 centimeters) of stainless steel _ would melt into a lava-like pile, slump into any remaining water on the floor, and potentially cause an explosion much bigger than the one caused by the hydrogen. Such an explosion would enhance the spread of radioactive contaminants. \n \n If the reactor core became exposed to the external environment, officials would likely began pouring cement and sand over the entire facility, as was done at the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident in the Ukraine, Peter Bradford, a former commissioner of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said in a briefing for reporters. \n \n Another expert on the call, Ken Bergeron, a physicist and former Sandia scientist, added that as a result of such a meltdown the surrounding land would be off-limits for a considerable period of time, and \"a lot of first responders would die.\" \n \n ___ \n \n AP National Writer Jeff Donn reported from Boston. ||||| The estimated death toll from Japan's disasters climbed past 10,000 Sunday as authorities raced to combat the threat of multiple nuclear reactor meltdowns and hundreds of thousands of people struggled to find food and water.

When spotted,... (Associated Press) \n \n Nuclear plant operators worked frantically to try to keep temperatures down in several reactors crippled by the earthquake and tsunami, wrecking at least two by dumping sea water into them in last-ditch efforts to avoid meltdowns. Officials warned of a second explosion but said it would not pose a health threat. \n \n Near-freezing temperatures compounded the misery of survivors along hundreds of miles (kilometers) of the northeastern coast battered by the tsunami that smashed inland with breathtaking fury. Rescuers pulled bodies from mud-covered jumbles of wrecked houses, shattered tree trunks, twisted cars and tangled power lines while survivors examined the ruined remains. \n \n One rare bit of good news was the rescue of a 60-year-old man swept away by the tsunami who clung to the roof of his house for two days until a military vessel spotted him waving a red cloth about 10 miles (15 kilometers) offshore. \n \n The death toll surged because of a report from Miyagi, one of the three hardest hit states. The police chief told disaster relief officials more than 10,000 people were killed, police spokesman Go Sugawara told The Associated Press. That was an estimate _ only 400 people have been confirmed dead in Miyagi, which has a population of 2.3 million. \n \n According to officials, more than 1,800 people were confirmed dead _ including 200 people whose bodies were found Sunday along the coast _ and more than 1,400 were missing in Friday's disasters. Another 1,900 were injured. \n \n For Japan, one of the world's leading economies with ultramodern infrastructure, the disasters plunged ordinary life into nearly unimaginable deprivation. \n \n Hundreds of thousands of hungry survivors huddled in darkened emergency centers that were cut off from rescuers, aid and electricity. At least 1.4 million households had gone without water since the quake struck and some 1.9 million households were without electricity. \n \n While the government doubled the number of soldiers deployed in the aid effort to 100,000 and sent 120,000 blankets, 120,000 bottles of water and 29,000 gallons (110,000 liters) of gasoline plus food to the affected areas, Prime Minister Naoto Kan said electricity would take days to restore. In the meantime, he said, electricity would be rationed with rolling blackouts to several cities, including Tokyo. \n \n \"This is Japan's most severe crisis since the war ended 65 years ago,\" Kan told reporters, adding that Japan's future would be decided by its response. \n \n In Rikuzentakata, a port city of over 20,000 virtually wiped out by the tsunami, Etsuko Koyama escaped the water rushing through the third floor of her home but lost her grip on her daughter's hand and has not found her. \n \n \"I haven't given up hope yet,\" Koyama told public broadcaster NHK, wiping tears from her eyes. \"I saved myself, but I couldn't save my daughter.\" \n \n A young man described what ran through his mind before he escaped in a separate rescue. \"I thought to myself, ah, this is how I will die,\" Tatsuro Ishikawa, his face bruised and cut, told NHK as he sat in striped hospital pajamas. \n \n Japanese officials raised their estimate Sunday of the quake's magnitude to 9.0, a notch above the U.S. Geological Survey's reading of 8.9. Either way, it was the strongest quake ever recorded in Japan, which lies on a seismically active arc. A volcano on the southern island of Kyushu _ hundreds of miles (kilometers) from the quake' epicenter _ also resumed spewing ash and rock Sunday after a couple of quiet weeks, Japan's weather agency said. \n \n Dozens of countries have offered assistance. Two U.S. aircraft carrier groups were off Japan's coast and ready to help. Helicopters were flying from one of the carriers, the USS Ronald Reagan, delivering food and water in Miyagi. \n \n Two other U.S. rescue teams of 72 personnel each and rescue dogs arrived Sunday, as did a five-dog team from Singapore. \n \n Still, large areas of the countryside remained surrounded by water and unreachable. Fuel stations were closed, though at some, cars waited in lines hundreds of vehicles long. \n \n The United States and a several countries in Europe urged their citizens to avoid travel to Japan. France took the added step of suggesting people leave Tokyo in case radiation reached the city. \n \n Community after community traced the vast extent of the devastation. \n \n In the town of Minamisanrikucho, 10,000 people _ nearly two-thirds of the population _ have not been heard from since the tsunami wiped it out, a government spokesman said. NHK showed only a couple concrete structures still standing, and the bottom three floors of those buildings gutted. One of the few standing was a hospital, and a worker told NHK that hospital staff rescued about a third of the patients. \n \n In the hard-hit port city of Sendai, firefighters with wooden picks dug through a devastated neighborhood. One of them yelled: \"A corpse.\" Inside a house, he had found the body of a gray-haired woman under a blanket. \n \n A few minutes later, the firefighters spotted another _ that of a man in black fleece jacket and pants, crumpled in a partial fetal position at the bottom of a wooden stairwell. From outside, while the top of the house seemed almost untouched, the first floor where the body was had been inundated. A minivan lay embedded in one outer wall, which had been ripped away, pulverized beside a mangled bicycle. \n \n The man's neighbor, 24-year-old Ayumi Osuga, dug through the remains of her own house, her white mittens covered by dark mud. \n \n Osuga said she had been practicing origami, the Japanese art of folding paper into figures, with her three children when the quake stuck. She recalled her husband's shouted warning from outside: \"'GET OUT OF THERE NOW!'\" \n \n She gathered her children _ aged 2 to 6 _ and fled in her car to higher ground with her husband. They spent the night in a hilltop home belonging to her husband's family about 12 miles (20 kilometers) away. \n \n \"My family, my children. We are lucky to be alive,\" she said. \n \n \"I have come to realize what is important in life,\" Osuga said, nervously flicking ashes from a cigarette onto the rubble at her feet as a giant column of black smoke billowed in the distance. \n \n As night fell and temperatures dropped to freezing in Sendai, people who had slept in underpasses or offices the past two nights gathered for warmth in community centers, schools and City Hall. \n \n At a large refinery on the outskirts of the city, 100-foot (30-meter) -high bright orange flames rose in the air, spitting out dark plumes of smoke. The facility has been burning since Friday. The fire's roar could be heard from afar. Smoke burned the eyes and throat, and a gaseous stench hung in the air. \n \n In the small town of Tagajo, also near Sendai, dazed residents roamed streets cluttered with smashed cars, broken homes and twisted metal. \n \n Residents said the water surged in and quickly rose higher than the first floor of buildings. At Sengen General Hospital, the staff worked feverishly to haul bedridden patients up the stairs one at a time. With the halls now dark, those who can leave have gone to the local community center. \n \n \"There is still no water or power, and we've got some very sick people in here,\" said hospital official Ikuro Matsumoto. \n \n Police cars drove slowly through the town and warned residents through loudspeakers to seek higher ground, but most simply stood by and watched them pass. \n \n In the town of Iwaki, there was no electricity, stores were closed and residents left as food and fuel supplies dwindled. Local police took in about 90 people and gave them blankets and rice balls, but there was no sign of government or military aid trucks. \n \n ___ \n \n Todd Pitman reported from Sendai.

Police have spent the equivalent of millions of dollars trying to find her, but no one has been charged and there have been no confirmed sightings. \n \n Earlier this month, South Australia Police found what they believed were the remains of a girl, aged between 2 \u00bd and 4 years old, dumped in a case on the side of a highway near the city of Adelaide. ||||| UK police make inquiries about remains found in suitcase but Australian authorities say there is currently \u2018no evidence\u2019 it relates to McCann case \n \n Police officers investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann have contacted Australian authorities over the discovery of a young girl\u2019s remains in a suitcase, Scotland Yard has said. \n \n The remains of a fair-haired girl likely to have been aged between two and four were found dumped on the side of a rural highway in the South Australian wild earlier this month. \n \n \n \n The girl is believed to have been killed at a different location at some time since the start of 2007, according to South Australian police.

Here's why: The remains, contained in a suitcase that also held a quilt and some clothing, are thought to be those of a fair-haired girl, between the ages of 2 and 4, who was killed some time after the beginning of 2007. Madeleine vanished at age 3 on May 3, 2007. NBC News reports police said the child was likely white, with hair about 7 inches long. The Australian Associated Press reported the skeletal remains were found on July 15; it's thought the suitcase had been left along the rural highway four to six weeks prior, with the child having been killed before that. British law enforcement officials confirm they have made contact, but neither side sounds overly optimistic. It's \"highly unlikely\" the remains are those of Madeleine, says Detective Superintendent Des Bray, per the Guardian. Adds the commissioner, to suggest the child is Madeleine \"at this point in time would purely be speculating to get attention.\" What they are zeroing in on, per the Advertiser: that homemade quilt. \"The quilt is really important to the investigation,\" says Bray.
