Nigro \n \n A decorated FDNY firefighter and father of four young children died when a fire erupted in a Harlem apartment building where a star-studded movie directed by Edward Norton had a shoot overnight, officials say. \n \n Michael R. Davidson, a 37-year-old Floral Park resident who has been with the FDNY for 15 years, died from his injuries while battling the fire at a five-story building on St. Nicholas Avenue and 149th Street, the FDNY said early Friday. \n \n The blaze broke out on the set of \"Motherless Brooklyn,\" which, according to IMDB, is being directed by Norton and stars Bruce Willis, Willem Dafoe, Alec Baldwin, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Leslie Mann. \n \n Dramatic Images Show Inferno at Ed Norton Harlem Film Shoot \n \n \n \n An NBC 4 New York photographer spoke to one of the actors, who said they had just finished filming for the day when they smelled smoke while they were breaking down. They called the fire department around 11 p.m. Thursday. \n \n Davidson was the nozzleman, meaning his job was to run the hoseline of Engine 69, which was the first to arrive at the five-alarm scene. The crew rushed to the basement, but the FDNY said once they got down there, the fire got worse, forcing the firefighters to retreat from the building.

He later died of critical injuries sustained while battling the blaze. \n \n Officials said two other firefighters suffered serious burns in the blaze. Those injured firefighters are being treated at an area hospital's burn center. Three other civilians suffered minor injuries. \n \n Davidson, who has been cited for his bravery and life-saving actions four times during his career, leaves behind his wife and four young children -- three daughters, ages 7, 3, and 1, and a 6-year-old son. He comes from a long line of firefighters. His father, Robert, who is now retired worked in the same firehouse as Davidson.

His death comes about a week after two FDNY firefighters, who were also members of the 106th Rescue Wing of the Air National Guard based in Westhampton Beach, died in a U.S. helicopter crash in Iraq. \n \n Floral Park neighbor Peggy Healy was devastated to learn of his death. She said the beloved firefighter had just shoveled their snow a day ago. \n \n \"I yelled across and said, 'Thank you, Michael!' And he said, 'Oh, you're very welcome,'\" said Healy. \"He was such kind man, such a kind man. It's just devastating.\" \n \n She said Davidson doted on his young children, and she'd always see him takng the kids to the bus stop and picking them up. \n \n \"He was always walking his beautiful little children, always walking and taking care of them,\" she said in tears. \n \n The St. Nicholas Avenue building where the fire started is the old St. Nick\u2019s Pub, according to a witness who lives nearby. The witness also told News 4 New York that the film has been shooting there for weeks. \n \n The crime and drama film, which is set to be released next year, is about a lonely detective afflicted with Tourette syndrome, working to solve the murder of his only friend, according to IMDB. The movie is set in 1950 and is based on a novel by Jonathan Lethem. \n \n Four'easter: See the Wrath of March's Latest Snowstorm \n \n The producers of \"Motherless Brooklyn\" said in a statement that they immediately notified the fire department once they noticed smoke coming into the set and started alerting residents of the building so that they could get out. \n \n \"To our great sorrow, we now know that a NYC firefighter lost his life battling the blaze that grew, and our hearts ache in solidarity with his family. New York City firefighters truly are the bravest in the world,\" the statement said. \"We watched firsthand with astonishment as they charged into the smoke to make sure all were safely out and then fought to contain the blaze and prevent it from spreading, putting their lives on the line as they do every day. The FDNY are real life super-heroes and have our boundless admiration and gratitude.\u201d \n \n \n \n The FDNY said the fire was under control around 2:30 a.m. Friday, more than three hours after it broke out. It\u2019s not clear what may have sparked the blaze. \n \n Spelman Beubrua was led, gasping and choking, out of his smoky apartment by firefighters. He lost all of his possessions in the fire. He broke down when he said the only reason he was alive was because of the FDNY. \n \n \"I'm here talking to you, it's because of them,\" Beubrua said behind tears. \"Then to come here and find out that one of them did not make it.

Bob Corker, retiring Republican senator from Tennessee and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, has been earning Twitter plaudits for his sorties against President Trump. He has called the president a toddler on Twitter (134,000 retweets and counting!) and told The New York Times that the president's instability might well put America \"on the path to World War III.\" \n \n In the scripted kabuki theater of American politics, the respected Republican statesman who calls out the president of his own party as reckless or extreme is a stock character, who must always receive loud calls of adulation from the chorus of the press. Bravo! \n \n But why is it, exactly, that anyone should respect Bob Corker's opinion about the president? Should it be more, or less, respected than his endorsement of that same irresponsible toddler for the presidency? His campaign-era praise for the foreign policy thinking of the man who he now warns risks World War III? His jockeying for a spot on the ticket with the toddler? His dismissal of those who, within the Republican Party, were saying exactly the same things, you know, back when something could have been done about it? \n \n There has been a very strong correlation between Bob Corker's public comments on Donald Trump and Bob Corker's perceived short-term interests, and his new about-face is no exception. He only started \"uncorking\" (get it?) about Trump once he decided not to run for re-election in a state that Trump carried by 25 points. He has calibrated his retirement announcement to encourage speculation about a 2020 bid, for which his recent comments are clearly useful in positioning him as an establishment primary challenge to Trump. What is it, exactly, that anyone should respect here? \n \n For the record, I am not engaging in \"whataboutism.\" I absolutely agree with Corker that the president of the United States behaves like a toddler and in other ways that are grave and alarming. The difference is that I haven't spent the past year obfuscating about that for political gain. \n \n It's worth expressing some moral outrage about that. Corker was an instrumental part of a Republican establishment that foreswore every opportunity to stop Trump during the campaign for the sake of short-term political gain: refusing to unite behind an anti-Trump candidate, quashing dissent in the run-up to the convention, sucking away the oxygen that might have enabled a non-quixotic third-party conservative bid, comforting themselves with notions that the GOP could \"run the country from Congress\" and so it was okay to put a \"toddler\" in charge of America's nuclear arsenal. Edmund Burke was right: All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing. The Bob Corkers of the world bear more responsibility for Donald Trump's election than the Stephen Bannons and Sean Hannitys. Corker's \"toddler\" comment is damning \u2014 but less so for Trump (it's not exactly a scoop) than for Corker himself. If Trump is such a toddler, why did Corker enable his rise in the first place? \n \n But there is also an important, even fundamental, political point, here. As Talleyrand, that French geopolitical master whom foreign policy hands should be able to quote, would say, \"C'est pire qu'un crime, c'est une faute.\" (\"It was worse than a crime; it was a blunder.\") It is well-understood that the United States, and the West in general, is in the grips of a populist insurgency that often has noxious ideas and even more often lacks the competence to turn even its good ideas into policy. It is less well-understood that a main driver of this insurgency's strength is the intellectual and even, arguably, moral bankruptcy of too many in our governing elites, who often speak the language of the common good but seem to believe in little more than that the common good always intersects with their own class interest and that they have a natural right to rule. Bob Corker's sudden rediscovery of principle right at the moment when it stops being risky politically is a darkly comical symbol of this contemptible attitude. \n \n Donald Trump became president at least in part because large swathes of Republican voters feel screwed by their party, and they feel this way because they are, well, correct. During his Senate tenure, Bob Corker's notable stances on economic policy include voting for Wall Street bailouts, support for a flat tax, and attacks on Social Security and Medicare. \n \n Fixing a problem requires first understanding it. Trump's personal behavior is contemptible and alarming, but the reason why someone like Trump could get into the White House in the first place, and the way to prevent a new Trump once this one is out one way or another, is to understand how and why the establishment that enabled his rise and the rise of his movement failed. There has been no hint that Bob Corker or those of his establishment ilk understand any of this, or plan to do anything about it other than continue to behave like the stereotype of the kind of establishment Republican that drove a once-proud party (and thence, the world) into the hands of a fool. \n \n Trump's obvious psychological unfitness for his office, important though it is, is also a convenient way to distract from the fundamental failures of the Republican establishment that made him possible. But on this subject Bob Corker has been utterly silent. I would rather hand the nuclear button to Bob Corker than Donald Trump, but if the difference between a toddler and a man is that the latter is capable to self-reflect and then take responsibility for his own actions, then the difference between these two becomes blurred. \n \n Bob Corker isn't an opponent of Donald Trump. He is his enabler. ||||| Republicans woke up Columbus Day morning to the sights and sounds of the wheels coming off their midterm-election bus and their legislative jalopy. First came a widely publicized war of words between President Trump and the prominent Republican senator, Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker. Then came a Bloomberg News story by Jennifer Jacobs and Bill Allison laying out Steve Bannon\u2019s intention to back challengers to most of the GOP senators seeking re-election next year. \n \n The Trump-Corker contretemps began last week when the Tennessee lawmaker, who had been a top contender to be Trump\u2019s running mate as well as secretary of State, took an obvious shot at the president when he told reporters that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, and White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly \u201care those people that help separate our country from chaos.\u201d Corker amplified his criticism on Fox News Sunday, charging that Trump was treating his office like \u201ca reality show,\u201d with reckless threats toward other countries that could set the nation \u201con the path to World War III.\u201d \n \n The tweet wars then began in earnest. Trump fired back that Corker \u201cdidn\u2019t have the guts\u201d to run for re-election, and Corker reponded by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.\u201d After adding that the former reality television star was \u201clike he\u2019s doing \u2018The Apprentice\u2019 or something,\u201d Corker concluded that \u201che concerns me,\u201d and it should \u201cconcern anyone who cares about our nation.\u201d \n \n In a New York Times interview later Sunday, this in a phone call with Jonathan Martin and Mark Landler, Corker said that \u201cI know for a fact that every single day at the White House, it\u2019s a situation of trying to contain him.\u201d Trump fired up his twitter gatling gun and wrote that \u201cBob Corker gave us the Iran Deal, & that\u2019s about it. We need HealthCare, we need Tax Cuts/Reform, we need people that can get the job done!\u201d \n \n While Trump has been highly critical of the Republican-led Congress in general, and the Senate Republican leadership in particular, for their failure to repeal and replace Obamacare, his exchange with Corker went to a darker place. Corker did what a lot of Republican leaders have been tempted to do \u2014 question the president\u2019s maturity and stability, and speculate how that might affect his performance as commander-in-chief. \n \n Over the last year Trump has singled out for criticism two endangered GOP incumbents up for re-election this year, Jeff Flake of Arizona and Dean Heller of Nevada. He also has engaged in an on-going feud with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. If Trump is to get anything done legislatively without having to depend on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, he must have the support of Corker, McConnell, Flake, and Heller. The opportunities to align with Schumer and Pelosi are likely to be few and far between. \n \n Citing three sources \u201cfamiliar with his plans,\u201d the Bloomberg News article reported that Bannon \u201cplans to support as many as 15 Republican Senate candidates in 2018, including several challengers to incumbents. He\u2019ll support only candidates who agree to two conditions: They will vote against McConnell as majority leader, and they will vote to end senators\u2019 ability to block legislation by filibustering. Bloomberg went on to say that only Senator Ted Cruz of Texas is safe because he\u2019s considered sufficiently conservative and seen to be moving toward the more populist approach Bannon favors. \n \n Bannon has already scored a victory in Alabama by successfully backing former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore against a Luther Strange, a senator appointed by the GOP establishment. The Bloomberg piece reported that Bannon was targeting incumbents Flake, Heller, Nebraska\u2019s Deb Fischer, Wyoming\u2019s John Barrasso, and Utah\u2019s Orrin Hatch, and the New York Times reported on Sunday that another Bannon favorite, Erik Prince, founder of the controversial security firm Blackwater, was considering a challenge to Barrasso. In the event that Sen. John McCain leaves office early \u2014 he is undergoing treatment for a virulent form of brain cancer \u2014 Bannon has indicated a preference for Paul Gosar, a state representative and tea party activist. In the race to replace Corker, Bannon intends to support Rep. Marsha Blackburn. \n \n Almost any conversation with congressional Republicans starts and ends with the need to cut taxes, now that tax reform no longer seems possible. Having failed to pass any legislation of real significance this year, and with a president who carries little weight on Capitol Hill, Republicans desperately need to put some points on the board. They are banking on passing a tax cut that\u2019s meaningful, that voters can see, feel, and touch. If they pass something insufficiently large, the political payoff will be commensurately small. \n \n With 25 Democratic Senate seats up next year, ten in states Trump carried, five in states the former real estate developer won by 19 points or more, this should be a year for the GOP to expand its current narrow 52-48 majority. Under different circumstances, the GOP could hope to boost their Senate numbers by four to seven seats, perhaps even reaching the magic 60-seat Senate super-majority level that could break filibusters on party line votes. But given their current disarray, Republicans will need to fight hard to gain any new seats, and losing one or two of their own seats would put their majority in jeopardy. \n \n The stakes are even higher in the House where their majority status is in real danger. The party needs to sublimate its divisions, get mainstream Republicans to the polls, and persuade the Trump base to cast ballot for non-Trump Republicans. That\u2019s a tall order. And it\u2019s why last week\u2019s news reduced the odds of the GOP retaining its majority from a good bet to even money. \n \n Correction: An earlier version of this story erroneously characterized Erik Prince\u2019s political plans. He is considering a run against John Barrasso of Wyoming. ||||| The Failing @ nytimes set Liddle' Bob Corker up by recording his conversation.

Bob Corker, the retiring Republican chair of the Senate foreign relations committee, has engaged in a heated back-and-forth with Trump for days now, including in an interview with The New York Times where he said that he feared Trump was steering the nation \"on the path to World War III.\" \n \n The President, a politician whose mantra has long been to hit back harder than someone hits him, is now treating Corker like he did his primary opponents: By giving him a nickname. \n \n \"The Failing @nytimes set Liddle' Bob Corker up by recording his conversation,\" Trump tweeted on Tuesday. \"Was made to sound a fool, and that's what I am dealing with!\" \n \n \"So have at it,\" Corker told the reporter. \"I understand we're on the record. I don't like normally talking to you on the record -- I'm kidding you -- but I will.\" \n \n Asked about Corker's comments, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters, \"Sen. Corker is certainly entitled to his own opinion, but he's not entitled to his own facts.\" \n \n \"The facts certainly don't lie, the President has certainly been very successful,\" she continued. \n \n Asked if Corker should resign, Sanders said that decision is not for the White House to make. \"I think that's a decision for Sen. Corker and the people of Tennessee,\" Sanders said. \n \n Trump continued his feud with Corker during a Tuesday meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, pushing back on the senator's statement that Trump is putting the United States on a path toward World War III. \n \n \"We were on the wrong path before. All you have to do is take a look,\" he said when asked if Corker was right. \"Now we're on the right path.\" \n \n Trump labeling Corker \"liddle\" is a throwback to the 2016 campaign, when he gave Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, then a presidential candidate himself, the same moniker. \n \n \"I'm the writer,\" Trump told New York magazine in 2016. \"Let me start with Little Marco. He just looked like Little Marco to me. And it's not Little. It's Liddle. L-I-D-D-L-E. And it's not L-Y-I-N-G Ted Cruz. It's L-Y-I-N apostrophe. Ted's a liar, so that was easy.\" \n \n The feud between Corker and Trump had escalated this weekend when the President tweeted that the outgoing senator \"begged\" for his endorsement before declining to run for re-election. \n \n \"He also wanted to be Secretary of State, I said 'NO THANKS.' He is also largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal,\" Trump tweeted. \"Hence, I would fully expect Corker to be a negative voice and stand in the way of our great agenda. Didn't have the guts to run!\" \n \n Todd Womack, Corker's chief of staff, denied the claim later in the day. \n \n \"The President called Senator Corker on Monday afternoon and asked him to reconsider his decision not to seek re-election and reaffirmed that he would have endorsed him, as he has said many times,\" Womack said in a statement. \n \n Corker, in the New York Times interview, said that Trump is acting \"like he's doing 'The Apprentice' or something,\" and added that he could set the nation \"on the path to World War III.\" \n \n The comment comes a week after Corker jabbed Trump, stating that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary James Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly \"help separate our country from chaos.\" \n \n The clash between Corker and Trump highlights fraying relations between the President and the men and women in Congress who the White House needs to deliver on the agenda Trump ran on. Trump has yet to score a signature legislative victory, a black mark on his record given his party controls both the Senate and House. \n \n Trump said Tuesday that he didn't think his feud with Corker would imperil his tax cut plan. \n \n \"I don't think so. I don't think so at all,\" he said. \"I think we are well on our way.\" \n \n Corker's comments have already infuriated Trump's base. Steve Bannon, Trump's former chief strategist who was let go from the White House earlier this year, called on the senator to resign in response. ||||| Should I have outed the people who said these things\u2014or should the countless other press people who have heard similar views? No: Reporters do have to keep confidences, and I conveyed the substance of this case as best I could during the Trump Time Capsule series through the election. Moreover, it\u2019s not clear that \u201cconcerns\ufffd? like these would have changed anyone\u2019s mind. During the campaign, most of Trump\u2019s fallen rivals blasted him in exceptional terms\u2014before truckling to support him against Hillary Clinton. One of the most remarkable illustrations was Senator Ted Cruz\u2019s extended denunciation of Trump as a \u201cpathological liar\ufffd? just before Trump clinched the nomination. Of course Cruz turned around to support him in the general election and has cast nearly all his Senate votes (94 percent) in alignment with Trump. Meanwhile, it\u2019s not even the lead news of the week that Trump\u2019s own secretary of state has half-heartedly non-denied Stephanie Ruhle\u2019s report on NBC that he called Trump a \u201cfucking moron.\ufffd? \n \n Now that Bob Corker, one-time supporter of Trump, has taken the commendable step of going public, what\u2019s next? \n \n * * * \n \n For reporters, there is a logical extension from the opening Corker has given. Get Mitch McConnell, get Paul Ryan, get John Thune and John Barrasso and John Cornyn, get Kevin McCarthy, get every Republican in a position of responsibility to answer: Do you agree with your colleague that Donald Trump is a danger to the country and the world? Who\u2019s right here: Your comrade who is the veteran chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee? Or a president who can\u2019t stop tweet-threatening \u201cLittle Rocket Man\ufffd?? And what about Corker\u2019s claim that the White House is a daily battleground to keep the incumbent under control? Are you going to call one of your own a liar? Or is he right about Trump? \n \n They won\u2019t answer. Knowing how not to answer comes as second nature. More smoothly than Rex Tillerson, they will decline to get into the \u201csilly stuff.\ufffd? But they should be put on the spot and made to take a stand. Especially the ones who will either face the voters soon\u2014or who are deciding, as Corker did recently, whether that\u2019s even worth it. \n \n (To be clear: every reporter already knows these are the questions to ask, and overall the resilience of the press is one of the heartening aspects of this disheartening era. I\u2019m just spelling out what to look for as day breaks and senators get within reporters\u2019 range.) \n \n For congressional Republicans, this is your moment in history\u2019s eye. One of your colleagues, who has chosen not to run for office again, and who also was the object of one of Trump\u2019s intemperate attacks this morning, has decided that he might as well tell the truth. It turns out that this is often the right way to go! As the (slightly altered) line from Mark Twain put it, by telling the truth you will gratify some people and astonish the rest. Perhaps Corker\u2019s motivations are not the purest or most glorious. He was nice to Trump last year, when Corker was in the mentioning-cloud as a possible secretary of state, and he was part of the \u201crespectable\ufffd? Republicans who disastrous enabled Trump. Corker\u2019s retorts today followed personal attacks from Trump. Still, he\u2019s doing more than his colleagues have. And Corker has moved toward a better place for himself in the annals of Senate history than he would have had only 24 hours ago.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 President Trump's feud with Republican Sen. Bob Corker is apparently still on, based on the new nickname the president bestowed upon Corker Tuesday morning. \"The Failing @nytimes set Liddle' Bob Corker up by recording his conversation,\" Trump tweeted. \"Was made to sound a fool, and that's what I am dealing with!\" Trump was referring to the interview Corker gave to the New York Times in which the senator likened the Trump White House to a \"reality show\" and suggested that reckless comments from the president could lead to World War III. Developments: Audio, transcript: The Times released excerpts from the interview, as well as audio here. It's not clear what Trump meant in saying that the newspaper set up Corker, but the transcript makes clear that Corker knew he was on the record, notes CNN. He also knew the call was being recorded, telling the reporter that his staff was recording it, \"and I hope you are, too.\" GOP trouble: At the National Journal, political analyst Charlie Cook of the Cook Political Report writes that Trump went to a \"darker place\" in his Corker criticism, and he now thinks the GOP majority is in jeopardy not only in the Senate but in the House. \"The party needs to sublimate its divisions, get mainstream Republicans to the polls, and persuade the Trump base to cast ballot for non-Trump Republicans,\" he writes. \"That's a tall order. And it's why last week's news reduced the odds of the GOP retaining its majority from a good bet to even money.\" Ulterior motives? Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry of the Week calls Corker a hypocrite for his sudden public turn on the president and suggests that the retiring senator is positioning himself to be an \"establishment\" primary challenger to the president in the 2020 election. Now what? James Fallows at the Atlantic writes that if Corker truly believes Trump might blunder his way into World War III, he has an obligation to \"do something about it\" by providing a crucial check on Trump's actions through his position as chair of the Foreign Relations Committee. \"Talk is better than nothing, but action is what counts.\" WSJ weighs in: The conservative editorial page of the Wall Street Journal thinks Corker spoke the truth about the president's \"lack of discipline, short fuse, narcissism and habit of treating even foreign heads of state as if they are Rosie O'Donnell,\" and it hopes other top Republicans follow Corker's lead because it might actually help. Little reaction: NBC News rounds up reaction from top Republicans to Corker's statements about the president and finds \"silence or a shrug.\" A typical sentiment, from Marco Rubio: \"You'll have to ask Sen. Corker what led him to make that statement. I haven't made that statement.\" Trump's new criticism comes just a week before a Senate vote important to Trump's tax plan, notes the New York Times.",
    "generated_summary": "Bob Corker, retiring Republican senator from Tennessee, has been earning Twitter plaudits for his sorties against President Trump. He has called the president a toddler on Twitter (134,000 retweets and counting!) and told The New York Times that the president's instability might well put America \"on the path to World War III\" In the scripted kabuki theater of American politics, the respected Republican statesman who calls out the president as reckless or extreme is a stock character, who must always receive loud calls of adulation from the chorus of the press.

This babbler bird communication is reminiscent of the way humans form meaningful words. The research findings, which are published in the journal PLOS Biology, reveal a potential early step in the emergence of the elaborate language systems we use today. \n \n Lead author Sabrina Engesser from the University of Zurich said: \u201cAlthough previous studies indicate that animals, particularly birds, are capable of stringing different sounds together as part of a complex song, these songs generally lack a specific meaning and changing the arrangement of sounds within a song does not seem to alter its overall message.\u201d \n \n \u201cIn contrast to most songbirds, chestnut-crowned babblers do not sing.

When flying, the birds produced a flight call \u201cAB\u201d, but when feeding chicks in the nest they emitted \u201cBAB\u201d prompt calls. \n \n When the researchers played the sounds back, the listening birds showed they were capable of discriminating between the different call types by looking at the nests when they heard a feeding prompt call and by looking out for incoming birds when they heard a flight call. This was also the case when the researchers switched elements between the two calls: making flight calls from prompt elements and prompt calls from flight elements, indicating that the two calls were indeed generated from rearrangements of the same sounds. \n \n Co-author Dr Simon Townsend from the University of Zurich said: \u201cThis is the first time that the capacity to generate new meaning from rearranging meaningless elements has been shown to exist outside of humans. \n \n \u201cAlthough the two babbler bird calls are structurally very similar, they are produced in totally different behavioural contexts and listening birds are capable of picking up on this.\u201d \n \n The authors report that in the chestnut-crowned babbler, the first sound element \u201cB\u201d is what seems to differentiate the meaning between flight and prompt vocalisations, akin to cat and at in English, where the c represents the meaning differentiating element, or phoneme. \n \n \u201cAlthough this so-called phoneme structuring is of a very simple kind, it might help us understand how the ability to generate new meaning initially evolved in humans\u201d added Dr Simon Townsend. \u201cIt could be that when phoneme structuring first got off the ground in our hominid ancestors, this is the form it initially took\u201d.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Scientists have discovered a talent never seen outside of humans in a small Australian bird: the ability to string sounds together to convey different meanings. Essentially, \"it's a very basic form of word generation,\" researcher Andy Russell tells the BBC. The team started out by listening to chestnut-crowned babbler birds. Rather than sing, they produce \"discrete calls made up of smaller, acoustically distinct individual sounds,\" an expert says in a press release. Two sounds, identified as \"A\" and \"B,\" kept getting repeated. For example, the birds used an \"AB\" call to tell other birds where they were while in flight (listening birds would look to the sky), while a \"BAB\" call told chicks it was feeding time (listening birds would look at nests). Rearranging the sounds of the flight call to produce the latter call showed no alteration in the birds' behavior, and vice versa, proving the individual sounds were in fact the same. \"Although the two babbler bird calls are structurally very similar, they are produced in totally different behavioral contexts and listening birds are capable of picking up on this,\" a researcher explains. Russell adds, per the Christian Science Monitor, the babblers may communicate this way because it's easier to swap existing sounds than make up new ones. What's perhaps most fascinating is that researchers believe the birds' \"B\" sound differentiates the meaning of the call. In other words, it's the \"c\" that discerns the words \"cat\" and \"at\" in the English language. Such distinguishing elements are called phonemes, and this basic example \"might help us understand how the ability to generate new meaning initially evolved in humans,\" an expert says. \"It could be that when phoneme structuring first got off the ground in our hominid ancestors, this is the form it initially took.\" Russell says the ability likely exists in other animals.

But power is fluid in Washington, and it's wielded in ever-changing ways, from the city's establishment bosses to its hungry young strivers. So now we're bringing you the most powerful person in D.C. this week (and the least powerful): a mini-guide to the players in American politics and why they matter now. \n \n \n \n Most Powerful Person in Politics: Hillary Clinton, Secretary of State \n \n Those who doubt Hillary's viability in 2016 should take note of the viral meme \"Texts From Hillary.\" It's a Tumblr that pairs a photo of HRC looking like a boss on a C-17 with even more boss quotes, retweeted ad infinitum this week. How much do Washington women love the texts? \"For attribution: omgsomuch,\" EMILY's List spokesperson Jess McIntosh emails. \"It's just the idea that Hillary is a force to be reckoned with, and she is still very relevant among Americans,\" says Stacy Lambe, one of D.C.'s young communications professionals who came up with the idea with a friend over drinks last week. \"We just captured on a simple idea about who she is, this whole 'head bitch, in-charge, badass' image that the photo itself demonstrated and we just had fun with that. It wasn't a commentary on anything, but the success might be due to the fact that there's this appreciation for her that has grown since she took over as Secretary of State. I think people have learned to appreciate who she is and value her again.\" \n \n ||||| Clinton: Stop talking. \n \n Worried woman: It\u2019s 3 a.m. and I think something\u2019s happening. \n \n Clinton: On it. \n \n Like most Internet sensations, the \u201cTexts from Hillary\u201d took a winding path from artifact to thing. When the photo first appeared last fall, a blogger from Reuters suggested that it made Clinton look bad: stuck on a plane, overloaded with work, falling asleep in her chair. \u201cQuick quiz,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou realize your job may sort of suck if you . . . are trying to read your PDA with your sunglasses on.\u201d \n \n But when the photo turned up, inexplicably, on his Facebook feed last week, Adam Smith saw it differently. Smith, 29, who works for a campaign-finance nonprofit in Washington, D.C., reposted the shot on Twitter with a comment along the lines of, \u201cHave you seen how fierce Hillary is in this picture?\u201d \n \n Last Wednesday at a bar, Smith showed the photo to his friend Stacy Lambe, 26, who works for a D.C. communications firm. \u201cI said, \u2018Have you seen this Hillary picture? I think we could make a meme out of it\u2019 \u201d Smith told me by phone. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018Texts from Hillary.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Done.\u2019 \u201d They went home and started a Tumblr blog, and before long, people were sending suggestions of their own. \n \n Nearly every contribution falls along the same theme: Hillary\u2019s not beleaguered, she\u2019s in charge. This is the story the photo tells. The frown makes her seem impatient. The sunglasses make her look aloof, but also glamorous. Gone are the man\u2019s-world accessories, the pantsuit and masculine haircut. Secretary Clinton is a woman, comfortably feminine, with long blonde hair, a chunky necklace, a giant broach. \n \n And, crucially, she\u2019s texting. In an age of impersonal communications, there\u2019s no medium more distant or nonchalant. Texting requires no utterance, no grammar, no coherent thought, and barely any physical effort. (The other day, a friend texted me: \u201ck.\u201d I knew what she meant.) To send a text is to say, \u201cI\u2019m sending you this message with my thumbs.

This one is all about respect. As Peggy Noonan of The Wall Street Journal said yesterday, Hillary Clinton is \"one of the few people who is in the Obama administration whose reputation from her work there has been enhanced as opposed to roughened.\" Where Obama, Biden, Gates, Geithner et al have suffered gray hairs and waning enthusiasm, Clinton \u2014 who entered the administration as Obama's graying runner-up \u2014 has undergone a reinvention and seems more powerful and unflappable than ever. \n \n Two takes from today: \n \n Benjy Sarlin, Talking Points Memo: \n \n Her 2008 campaign, which once seemed a cautionary tale about hubris, looks at least somewhat better with age. Obama touted a unifying national message in his run against Clinton, suggesting that Clinton\u2019s scars from decades of battling Republicans would make it difficult to ever be effective in the White House. Now Obama\u2019s post-partisan vision has given way to a tough dogfight of a general election in which he\u2019s running against the intransigent Republican party\u2019s \u201cthinly veiled social Darwinism.\u201d And Clinton\u2019s popularity \u2014 including with Republicans \u2014 has never been higher, prompting yet another boomlet of interest in a 2016 presidential run. \n \n Marin Cogan, GQ's Death Race 2012: ||||| What a difference four years makes: When she was running for the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton was parodied as drab and calculated, especially compared with young and vigorous Barack Obama and winking and fresh-faced Sarah Palin. Now, she\u2019s fueling Internet jokes based on her own brand of badass cool. \n \n More than just an image rebound, Clinton is enjoying a genuine resurgence. \n \n Her 2008 campaign, which once seemed a cautionary tale about hubris, looks at least somewhat better with age. Obama touted a unifying national message in his run against Clinton, suggesting that Clinton\u2019s scars from decades of battling Republicans would make it difficult to ever be effective in the White House. \n \n Now Obama\u2019s post-partisan vision has given way to a tough dogfight of a general election in which he\u2019s running against the intransigent Republican party\u2019s \u201cthinly veiled social Darwinism.\u201d And Clinton\u2019s popularity \u2014 including with Republicans \u2014 has never been higher, prompting yet another boomlet of interest in a 2016 presidential run. \n \n Part of this is the nature of her position. The secretary of State has traditionally been an apolitical figure and, consequently, those who have held the position have often enjoyed higher approval ratings than their boss. Clinton has held fast to this tradition and avoided injecting herself into the day\u2019s hot-button issues. There are some occasional exceptions \u2014 last month she told MSNBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell that she was glad to see Rush Limbaugh\u2019s screed against law student Sandra Fluke draw widespread condemnation. \n \n Still, given how well established \u2014 and polarizing \u2014 a political figure Clinton was considered prior to her appointment compared to many of her predecessors, the scale of her popularity is impressive. A recent Gallup poll showed her favorability rating reach new heights at 66 percent, including 40 percent of Republicans who view her positively, an astronomical figure for a prominent Democrat these days. From the public\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s clear that she\u2019s settled easily into a behind-the-scenes role as a loyal and competent secretary of State. \n \n Her lower visibility seems to have created some pent-up demand from her fans, though. This week a website \u201cTexts From Hillary\u201d created by two supporters, Stacy Lambe and Adam Smith, exploded on the Internet, generating tens of thousands of links on Facebook and Tumblr in its first 24 hours. The site features several two-panel gags that show Clinton on her Blackberry, clad in shades on a military jet, purportedly texting with various political and pop culture figures, from Condoleezza Rice to Ryan Gosling. \n \n Clinton\u2019s cold, relentless style was considered one of her biggest vulnerabilities, forming the basis for parodies of her on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and attracting a number of sexist jabs from pundits. By the end of her campaign, however, she had drawn considerable respect even from many critics for her toughness and resolve during a long and difficult primary. Lambe told TPM he was hoping to capture this trait in his site. \n \n \u201cThat photo just captures how people tried to make her out to be a bitch when she\u2019s actually the head bitch in charge,\u201d Lambe said. \u201cEver since she was appointed secretary of State there\u2019s been a renewed appreciation for Hillary.\u201d \n \n As for the idea for the initial two-panel gag, \u201cthe alcohol helped,\u201d said Smith. \n \n It\u2019s no accident that the notion of Clinton as the peak of steady competence has proven so resonant. Phil Singer, a spokesman for her 2008 presidential campaign, told TPM Clinton\u2019s recent success follows a consistent trend in which she is best regarded when working on policy instead of politics. Before her 2008 run, for example, Clinton was an extremely popular senator both in New York and among her colleagues. \n \n \u201cWhen people see her doing her job and not getting involved with the back-and-forth, they\u2019re happy,\u201d Singer said, acknowledging that it was \u201cironic\u201d given her highly political roles as First Lady, a tough Senate candidate in 2000 and an even tougher presidential candidate in 2008. \n \n The fact that she\u2019s kept her hands clean during an incredibly tense three-year standoff between the White House and national Republicans may also artificially boost her standing as voters imagine what could have been if she had won the nomination. \n \n \u201cSome people\u2019s views on her may be reflective of the fact people had higher hopes for Obama,\u201d Republican strategist Liz Mair said, \u201cand its sort of evened out so she looks better by comparison.\u201d \n \n Not surprisingly, the 2016 speculation that began even before the 2008 election ended is worming its way back into the press in a major way. Plenty of Democrats are hoping she\u2019ll run again, with Nancy Pelosi declaring just last week that she should consider waging another bid. \n \n Clinton has mostly avoided the topic, though she\u2019s hinted that her political days may be behind her at this point. She would be 69 on inauguration day, 2017. \n \n \u201cI believe that she\u2019s being absolutely honest with you when she says she doesn\u2019t think she\u2019ll go back into politics,\u201d Bill Clinton told ABC News recently. \u201cBut if she comes home and we do this foundation stuff for the rest of our lives, I\u2019ll be happy; if she changes her mind and decides to run, I\u2019ll be happy.\u201d \n \n Were Clinton to run she would almost certainly shed a significant amount of her current popularity with the right as soon as she seized a partisan mantle again. But her impressive tenure as secretary of State in a difficult transition period from the tumultuous Bush era would only boost her core appeal as the party\u2019s most battle-tested heavyweight. One need only look to the equivalent time period in the 2004 presidential cycle to underscore how unpredictable things are in politics \u2014 Barack Obama was a virtually unknown state senator then, and George Allen was widely considered the man to beat on the Republican side. \n \n Benjy Sarlin Benjy Sarlin is a reporter for Talking Points Memo and co-writes the campaign blog, TPM2012.

(Photo by Matt Sayles/Invision/AP) (Associated Press) \n \n NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Bruno Mars owned the Grammys with his R&B-inspired album \"24K Magic,\" winning all six awards he was nominated for at a show where hip-hop was expected to have a historical night. \n \n Jay-Z, the leading nominee with eight, walked away empty handed Sunday \u2014 a year after his wife lost album of the year to Adele, causing fans and peers to criticize the Recording Academy for not properly rewarding Beyonce's bold \"Lemonade\" project. \n \n And though Kendrick Lamar won five awards, he lost in the top categories, marking another year where rappers were restricted to wins in the rap categories, instead of earning coveted prizes like album of the year. \n \n Mars picked up album of the year for \"24K Magic,\" record of the year for the title track, and song of the year \u2014 shared with seven co-writers \u2014 for the No. 1 hit, \"That's What I Like.\" \n \n Jay-Z and Lamar could have become the first rapper to win song or record of the year, and the third rap-based act to win album of the year. \n \n But Mars' win still marked some growth for the Academy: His is one of the few R&B albums to win the top prize. He dedicated his win to songwriters who have made history in R&B music, including Babyface, Teddy Riley, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. \n \n Lamar's wins at Madison Square Garden in New York City included best rap album, best rap song, best rap performance, best rap/sung performance and best music video. He has a career total of 12 Grammys. \n \n Lamar also won with his performance: He kicked off the Grammys with a powerful and poignant performance featuring video screens displaying a waving American flag behind him, as background dancers dressed as army soldiers marched and moved behind him. At one point, Lamar's background dancers, dressed in red, were shot down as he rapped lyrics, later coming back to life as fire burst to end the six-minute performance. \n \n But the night's top performer was Kesha, who was passionate and striking onstage with the help of powerful women behind her, including the Resistance Revival Chorus, Cyndi Lauper, Camila Cabello, Julia Michaels, Andra Day and Bebe Rexha. Dressed in white, they won over the audience while singing Kesha's \"Praying\" and hugged at the song's end as some audience members cried, including Hailee Steinfeld. \n \n Kesha , who earned her first pair of Grammy nominations this year, has been in a legal war with former producer and mentor Dr. Luke. Janelle Monae introduced the performance with strong words. \n \n \"We come in peace but we mean business. To those who would dare try to silence us, we offer two words: Time's Up,\" Monae said. \"It's not just going on in Hollywood. It's not just going on in Washington. It's here in our industry, too.\" \n \n Before the performance, Maren Morris, Eric Church and Brothers Osborne performed an emotional rendition of Eric Clapton's \"Tears In Heaven\" \u2014 written after his son died \u2014 in honor of the 58 people who died at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas last year. The names of victims were displayed behind them as they performed. \n \n The performances were two of the show's serious moments. Dozens of artists and music industry players also sported white roses in support of the Time's Up and #MeToo movements against sexual abuse and harassment. \n \n \"Black is beautiful, hate is ugly,\" rapper Logic said onstage after performing the suicide prevention anthem \"1-800-273-8255.\" The performance, with best new artist winner Alessia Cara and Khalid, included a group of suicide attempt and loss survivors selected by the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. \n \n Sting's performance was somewhat political as he sang his 1987 song, \"Englishman in New York,\" which includes the lyrics, \"Oh, I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien, I'm an Englishman in New York.\" \n \n Chris Stapleton paid tribute to Tom Petty with Emmylou Harris and also won three awards, including best country album, best country song and best country solo performance. \n \n \"We always try to make great records ... and I guess this is a testament to that,\" Stapleton said. \n \n Little Big Town, who beautifully sang their Taylor Swift-penned No. 1 hit \"Better Man,\" won best country duo/group performance with the song. \n \n Others who shined onstage included Lady Gaga, who won over the audience with a rousing performance of the songs \"Joanne\" and \"Million Reasons\"; Sam Smith gave a powerful performance of the song \"Pray\"; and Pink was a vocal powerhouse while she sang \"Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken.\" \n \n During the pre-telecast, The Rolling Stones picked up their third career Grammy \u2014 for best traditional blues album for \"Blue & Lonesome\" \u2014 while Ed Sheeran won best pop vocal album. Emmy and Golden Globe winner Childish Gambino, who picked up best traditional R&B performance, gave a smooth and sultry performance of \"Terrified\" in all-white featuring screeching high notes. Gambino was joined by young singer-actor, JD McCrary, who matched his vocals and sings on the original track. \n \n The show, hosted by James Corden, also featured some comedy. Hillary Clinton , John Legend, Cher, Snoop Dogg, Cardi B, and DJ Khaled won over the audience in a skit when reading lines from Michael Wolff's book, \"Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House.\" Corden said the book could compete for the best spoken world album Grammy next year. \n \n \"That's the one,\" Corden said in the video after Clinton, a 1997 spoken word Grammy winner, spoke. It earned a rousing applause from the crowd. \n \n Dave Chappelle, who was part of Lamar's opening performance, won best comedy album during the televised show. \n \n \"I am honored to win an award, finally, and I wanted to thank everyone at Netflix, at 'Saturday Night Live,' at 'The Chappelle Show,'\" he said. \n \n Puppies were passed to the losers of best comedy album, including Jerry Seinfeld, Sarah Silverman and Jim Gaffigan. \n \n Posthumous Grammys were awarded to actress Carrie Fisher, singer Leonard Cohen and engineer Tom Coyne, who worked on Mars' \"24K Magic\" album. \n \n Double winners included Jason Isbell, Justin Hurwitz and CeCe Winans. \n \n ___ \n \n Online: \n \n http://www.grammy.com \n \n ____ \n \n For full coverage of awards season, visit: https://apnews.com/tag/AwardsSeason",

[See the damage caused to Midway .] \n \n The Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge in the North Pacific Ocean is famous for its Laysan albatross population. Midway lies near the northwestern end of the Hawaiian Islands, about a third of the way between Honolulu and Tokyo. The atoll is an unincorporated territory of the United States. \n \n Midway was struck by 5-foot (1.5-meter) waves after the quake struck.

Black mantle and upperwings. Underwings have black margins and irregular streaks on converts. Dark eye patch. Bill varies from gray to yellow with darker tip; pink legs/feet. Length: 79-81cm (31.6-32.4 in); wingspan: 195-203 cm (6.4-6.7 ft); average life span: 12-40 yrs. Laysan Albatross and chick \n \n Photo credit: Robert Shallenberger \n \n Midway Population \n \n Seventy-one percent of the world's population nests on Midway. In January 2008, 452,609 breeding pairs of Laysan Albatross were nesting on all three islands of Midway Atoll (Sand: 274,043; Eastern: 176,561; and Spit: 2,005). \n \n Feeding Habits \n \n Primarily nocturnal feeders. Laysans are surface feeders. Therefore feed on anything that floats on the surface of the water; squid, fish, crustaceans and flying fish eggs. Unfortunately, this inludes marine debris as well; with an estimated 5 tons of plastic being accidently fed to chicks each year. Laysans usually stay at least 20 to 30 kilometers offshore during the nonbreeding months (July - October). During these months Laysans are distributed throughout the northwestern and northeastern range of the Pacific. \n \n Breeding \n \n Monogamous. If one of the mates should die, they will most likely create a new pair bond. Nests are made up of surrounding grasses, dirt or shrubbery and are piled into large mounds that form a nest cup. Laying begins in mid-November. One egg is laid and incubation lasts about 65 days. Incubation starts with the female who usually stays for a short 2-day span. The male then takes over for as long as three weeks. During the month of December the number of incubating males outnumber that of incubating females 15:1. If the egg is infertile or breaks during incubation, re-laying will not occur that year. \n \n Chicks hatch during late January to mid-February. Chicks live off a diet of flying fish eggs and squid oil, a product that is rich in fat. Both parents will feed the chick by regurgitation and will often leave them for several days while they obtain food out at sea. The rich squid and stomach oil is filled with fatty acids and nutrients that can sustain a chick for the number of days between feedings. Fledging occurs 5-6 months after hatching (mid-June through late July). Parents will often leave before the chicks have reached their full juvenile plumage. \n \n Subadults return to their natal nesting colony after spending 3 - 5 years at sea. Elaborate courtship dances take place throughout the colony while these young birds search for a mate. Mating and first nesting usually occurs by age 6-8.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Wisdom the Laysan albatross is \"at least\" 63 years old, experts say, making her the oldest known wild bird on the planet. And, amazingly, she's still hatching chicks. Last week, a worker at the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge\u2014Wisdom's home in the north Pacific\u2014saw the mother caring for a new chick, according to a press release. And it's a feat she's managed for each of the past seven years, LiveScience notes. For comparison, most Laysan albatrosses live between 12 and 40 years, per the US Fish & Wildlife Service. Wisdom first came to the attention of researchers while incubating an egg ... in 1956. She was tagged then, and has likely raised no fewer than 30 chicks in her lifetime. Wisdom's \"ability to continue to hatch chicks during the last half century is beyond impressive\" given \"the threats that albatross face at sea,\" says a biologist. Chief among those threats: tsunamis. Battered by five-foot waves in the wake of Japan's 2011 earthquake, some 2,000 adult albatrosses on Midway's islands were estimated to have died; Wisdom obviously survived. And she's racked up many such feats, says the refuge manager. Among them: She's \"logged literally millions of miles over the Pacific Ocean in her lifetime to find enough fish eggs and squid to feed herself and multiple chicks.\" (We noted last year that the second-oldest albatross known to hatch a chick was 61.)",

He and Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling, another possible contender for the majority leader position, spoke by phone Tuesday night, according to a GOP source familiar with the conversation. The two have a friendly relationship and discussed the leadership situation. But it is unclear if there was any resolution from the discussion. \n \n Reps.

    "document": "\"Come a Little Closer\" by Cage the Elephant, from Melophobia, courtesy of RCA Records. Buy It Now \n \n Published in the November 2013 issue \n \n THE FIRST HOUR: \n \n THOUGHTS ON PENMANSHIP, BLOODLESS CAREERISM, AND SLEEPING \n \n Four-fifty on a Thursday afternoon, deep in a shadowy bar at a hotel called the Nomad, downtown Manhattan, and Scarlett Johansson actually wants to write. I give her a little hotel pad, maybe four-by-six, which she grabs in her small, ringless fingers. She takes my pen eagerly. \n \n \"What do you want me to write?\" she says. She will write what I tell her, she says. \n \n I don't know. \"Don't you have a little passage memorized?\" I ask. \"A little Shakespeare, maybe? 'Oh, for a muse of fire,' something like that?\" \n \n She clicks her tongue. \"I think it should be neutral,\" she says, shaking her head. \"Shouldn't involve any acting. I'm afraid I'll emphasize the Oh or something.\" As she thinks, she purses her lips, looks down, casting a little furtive charm. This one. She came in here \u0097 and this place is hung with velvet curtains and underlit by 40-watt bulbs; it's seriously dark \u0097 with her sunglasses on, walked six feet in front of me, at her publicist's side, in her gray cotton tracksuit, half pointing at tables that might work for her. All movie star up in here. And I didn't look at her ass. I don't know that she wanted me to. Probably not. Surely not. In any case, I didn't. \n \n She bites the inside of her cheek when she thinks. There is an extremely large platter of cut vegetables on the table. \"Crudit\u00e9s.\" I say it out loud, a word no one used ten years ago. \n \n \"My God,\" she says when it arrives. \"So many vegetables.\" \n \n Her voice is a raspy frequency in the air. Legitimately as pertinent and defining a component of her physical makeup as her lips, her cheekbones, her legs. When you're with her, you feel that voice. This bar is loud with cocktail hour, but the matter of her voice, the fact of it, hangs in the air even so \u0097 always a little sandy, somehow broken down, as if she'd been singing all day. Whether she breathes right or projects well I do not know, but her voice cuts the murmuring clatter of forks against small plates, ice spun in highballs. You can hear it no matter what. \n \n \"I wish I could write a parable,\" she says. \"Or maybe just an adage. I could write that one where I never know what the hell it means. Well, I guess if I thought about it \u0097 I mean, I have thought about it, of course, and figured it out. But it eludes me the first time I hear it. Every time. It's not logical. At first, I mean.\" \n \n \"Like 'A stitch in time saves nine?' I never get that one.\" \n \n \"Exactly,\" she says. \"But it's about birds. 'A bird in the bush.' Or \" \n \n \"Oh, yeah.\" \n \n \n \n \u0097Scarlett Johansson \n \n So these are the words she writes: A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Twice. Once in cursive. Once printed. Then she slides the pad to me and says, \"Now you do it.\" And so I take the pen. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, after all. \n \n \"Come on,\" she says. \n \n \"Okay,\" I say. \"But you're making me nervous.\" \n \n I write it once. \"Now print it,\" she says. And, of course, I screw that up. So my printed line reads A BIRD IN THE HAND IS WORTH TWO IN THE BIRD. \n \n Scarlett Johansson clucks into the air. \"That's gotta be bad for the bird,\" she says. Me, I want to start it all over again. \"No, no, it's fine,\" she reassures me. \"Just give it to them that way.\" She bites a thin hook of sweet orange pepper. \"See what the words tell you.\" \n \n We're creating a handwriting sample. Scarlett offers hers for me to take to a graphologist for an analysis of character. You could say she was eager, a movie star all the way, uncowered and free. When she's like this, willing \u0097 wanting even \u0097 to give in to harebrained plots, you really feel like you're talking to a bombshell, because bombshells are fun. To her, it sounds like fun to have a stranger deconstruct her penmanship in the sidebar of a magazine article. It's part of a search for truth, after all. Not exactly bungee jumping, but Scarlett is brave like that. She's not one of those who pine for the privacy lost to celebrity, nor does she tell teary stories of some paparazzo who stalked her in the doorway of a cupcake shop. Scarlett just plain operates in the world, which can make her seem a little chilly at first, even sour. \n \n She's only twenty-eight. She's been at it long enough to have done most of it before. Critical success, commercial success, action movie, its sequel and re-sequel. Lost in Translation to Vicky Cristina Barcelona to the various iterations of the Avengers. She's now been the Sexiest Woman Alive twice \u0097 well earned, too. But what do they say about impressions? \n \n The first of her: She seems not to care, to be bored, aloof. But that's as if drawn only from looking at pictures and not reading the text. Truth is, Scarlett is a politically astute, card-playing, magic-loving smart-ass, fairly generous in her time and attentions, a woman who will share her sandwich, a woman who likes horsing around in a bar on a muggy afternoon, a platter of hand-cut vegetables at the ready. \n \n This year, Scarlett says, has been the busiest of her life. One movie released, two more coming out in the next five months, and two more in production. She finished a full run of a Broadway revival of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof in March. In the movie she has out right now, Don Jon, she plays the hot, manipulative girlfriend of a porn addict. She makes a hootchie girl elegant, offering ascendant beauty in every scene. Hers is an unstressed beauty, which may be why her look is so mutable, more slender than buxom and fleshy. Her next movie is Under the Skin, a horror film in which she plays a flesh-tearing supernatural wandering across Scotland. \n \n In this bar today, she does not look like that horny Catholic in Don Jon for a dozen reasons you already know: She's wiped out from the photo shoot, wearing no makeup, different shoes, different bra, and so on. \n \n \"I'm exhausted and this is my last day in the world,\" she says, sunglasses off now. \"This is the last day, and this is the last piece of work. Then I'm taking a month-long vacation. But I'm not going anywhere, which just makes it more of a staycation. There's luxury in being near home. When you spend a lot of time, like I do, just standing around and waiting, or being moved from place to place, every minute gets consumed by something someone else has set up for you. And it's not like I'm always in a beautiful place wearing something gorgeous. I've stood around bogs wearing half a million dollars' worth of jewelry, up to my knees in the rot, thinking how much more or less the place smelled like a sewer than it did the day before. And that is not what you'd call a problem exactly; it just wears you out. What I want to do right now is sleep late, read the paper. I've come to see that there's something pretty great about having two hours to read.\" \n \n Why accept the title Sexiest Woman Alive if everything is so busy just now? \n \n Here, she shrugs. \"I'm the only woman to win it twice, right?\" she says. \n \n She is correct. \n \n \"You know, I gotta hustle. I'm a twenty-eight-year-old woman in the movie business, right?\" she says. \"Pretty soon the roles you're offered all become mothers. Then they just sort of stop. I have to hedge against that with work\u0097theater, producing, this thing with Esquire.\" \n \n Then, as if she hears herself, she looks straight at me and says: \"Sounds pretty bloodless, I guess.\" \n \n She'll spend her vacation on the beach in the Hamptons, in a house she rents with friends. \"It's a contemporary house, with a modern Swedish slant.\" For whatever reason\u0097my own prejudices, a tone I mistakenly pick up on in her voice, beach houses I have known\u0097I assume she's saying, the way people do when they rent, that the furniture sucks but it's fine because the water's right outside. \n \n And here I say, too casually, \"Swedish? Like what, like Ikea and that shit?\" \n \n She smiles wryly and speaks softly, unruffled and clear. \"No,\" she says. \"Not like Ikea.\" \n \n KEEP READING, FOR MORE FROM SCARLETT (AND MORE PHOTOS, TOO) >> ||||| (Click Prev or Next to continue viewing images.) \n \n ADVERTISEMENT (Click Prev or Next to continue viewing images.) \n \n FILE - In this Feb. 28, 2014 file photo, U.S. actress Scarlett Johansson, left, and her partner Romain Dauriac arrive at the 39th French Cesar Awards Ceremony, in Paris.

In Denver alone, we've seen several instances of highly aggressive, predatory, and what we consider to be unethical practices. We truly believe that ABInBev intends to systematically destroy American craft beer as we know it. We don't personally buy, seek, trade, or acquire any of their products for this reason, and we've been known to encourage our friends to do the same. \n \n As some of you may know, and something many people have asked us about today, we have two collaboration beers with Wicked Weed currently in-progress; one beer at our facility and one at theirs. We also had plans, and were looking forward to attending, the Wicked Weed Funkatorium Invitational this July. We had a decision to make - to continue a business relationship with Wicked Weed now that they will be owned by ABInBev, or to cut ties and hopefully remain friends. \n \n For us, the choice is clear. At this stage, we don't feel we are able to have a business relationship with Wicked Weed because that connection, ultimately, is one with ABInBev. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t feel that having any connection with ABInBev is something we can do while still maintaining our mission, values, and core beliefs. \n \n What this means is that we will not be able to lend our name to the unfinished collaboration beer currently aging in Asheville, NC. Additionally, the beer we brewed with Wicked Weed here at Black Project will be blended with other existing aged beer we have on hand to make something totally different which we will not consider a Wicked Weed collaboration. Finally, we will not be attending the Wicked Weed Funkatorium Invitational in July. \n \n We wish the best to everyone at Wicked Weed and we are happy for their success. We know they will continue to make great beers and we hope to remain personal friends in the future. \n \n Sincerely, \n \n \n \n James Howat and Sarah Howat \n \n Black Project Spontaneous & Wild Ales ||||| Craft beer drinkers, prepare for the hair on your presumably hipster-bearded faces to stand on end. You are being mocked, yet again, during the most widely watched TV event of the year, the Super Bowl. And yet again, it\u2019s Budweiser dishing the disses. \n \n The fact that you yourself probably mock the \u201cKing of Beers\u201d and Bud drinkers on a regular basis may offer some degree of comfort. But that\u2019s likely not enough to stop craft beer brewers and fans from being agitated by the latest craft beer-bashing Super Bowl ad from Budweiser. \n \n Last year, there was considerable backlash to Bud\u2019s Super Bowl commercial, which proclaimed Bud as \u201cproudly a macro beer\u201d and made fun of hipster types who enjoyed fancy, \u201cfussed over\u201d brews. Understandably, the craft beer world was outraged, and some even created parodies of the Bud commercial. \n \n Even fellow beer giant MillerCoors issued a statement condemning the Budweiser Super Bowl commercial. \u201cWe believe each and every style of beer is worth fussing over,\u201d the message from MillerCoors stated. \u201cQuality isn\u2019t something that belongs to a single style of beer or a single brewer.\u201d \n \n Read next: Big Beer\u2019s 5-Point Plan to Crush the Craft Beer Revolution \n \n A big reason people were upset with the ad is that Budweiser\u2019s parent company, Anheuser-Busch InBev, is clearly infatuated with craft beer, and the message was hypocritical. The company has been buying up craft beer labels left and right, including brands like Breckenridge Brewery and Four Peaks very recently. What\u2019s more, Anheuser-Busch InBev not only created one of America\u2019s most popular faux indie \u201ccrafty\u201d beers with the Shock Top label, but it is featuring Shock Top in a Super Bowl commercial this year for the first time ever. \n \n Nonetheless, the Budweiser Super Bowl ads of this year and last mock craft beer. In fact, despite the fact that Shock Top is often served with an orange wedge\u2014and the logo and tap handles even feature an orange\u2014the Bud commercial this year points out that Budweiser is \u201cNot a Fruit Cup,\u201d while showing a grizzled old-timer at the bar flicking a fruit wedge off his pint of Bud. \n \n This year\u2019s Super Bowl ad features a pounding soundtrack and a series of proclamations pointing out what Budweiser isn\u2019t. We learn in boldface CAPS that Budweiser is\u2026 \n \n NOT SMALL \n \n (Most craft brewers are small, indie operations, and presumably, small is bad?) \n \n NOT SIPPED \n \n (Sipping is for sissies who drink beer for the taste.) \n \n NOT SOFT \n \n (More subtle messaging that craft beer is for wusses.) \n \n NOT A FRUIT CUP \n \n (See above; also, if you haven\u2019t gotten the message yet, Bud is macho, not fruity.) \n \n NOT IMPORTED \n \n (Considering that Anheuser-Busch InBev is not an U.S. company, Budweiser is not really an American brand either, but why point this out in a commercial seen by more than 100 million viewers? Side note: The 4,000 craft breweries in the U.S. aren\u2019t imported either, and unlike Budweiser, they are, in fact, American-owned.) \n \n NOT FOR EVERYONE \n \n (Something we can all agree on!) \n \n [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF711XAtrVg&w=640&h=390] \n \n If the point of such an ad is to stir up some controversy in the beer world, Bud\u2019s ad will probably succeed. Yet there\u2019s probably another reason the commercial was created with such an anti-craft stance. It\u2019s not supposed to win over craft beer drinkers by insulting them. That would never work. \n \n Read next: Why Super Bowl Advertisers Are OK That the Commercials Don\u2019t Boost Sales \n \n Instead, the goal seems to be making Budweiser drinkers feel OK, perhaps even proud, that they are Budweiser drinkers. They aren\u2019t trendy. They aren\u2019t soft or small, or fruity. And apparently, they feel so insecure that they need for Budweiser to point all of this out.",

That's the situation that has fans of the Wicked Weed brewery now crying \"treachery,\" per the Washington Post, which reports on the news that the Asheville, NC, institution has teamed up with Anheuser-Busch InBev \"as a strategic partner.\" The reason for the move by Wicked Weed\u2014which the Citizen-Times notes was founded in 2012 by Walt and Luke Dickinson and friends Ryan, Rick, and Denise Guthy\u2014is, as Walt Dickinson explains, to stay competitive. A fellow craft brewery owner in Oregon backs him up, noting that his own brewery's acquisition by AB InBev offered him access to better ingredients and distribution. But the buyout has craft beer fans livid, especially after Budweiser's 2015 and 2016 Super Bowl ads that mocked craft beer drinkers. Wicked Weed's Facebook announcement was met with angry and sad emoji, with \"very disappointed\" and \"disheartened\" just a sampling of the negative comments. Some of Wicked Weed's distributors and partners aren't happy, either, with Denver's Black Project brewery cutting its ties to WW\u2014not because it doesn't love the beer, but because it believes AB InBev has \"unethical practices\" and \"intends to systematically destroy American craft beer as we know it.\" Other commenters on Wicked Weed's Facebook page say they will remain loyal fans. \"At the end of the day, great beer will win,\" Walt Dickinson tells the Citizen-Times.

    "document": "PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) \u2014 The chief prosecutor in Oscar Pistorius' murder trial said Thursday the double-amputee athlete's lawyers have floated more than one theory in a dishonest attempt to defend against a murder charge for his killing of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. \n \n Barry Roux, front, the lawyer defending Oscar Pistorius, accompanied by his team, arrives at the high court in Pretoria, South Africa, Thursday, Aug. 7, 2014. On Thursday and Friday, both sides will summarize... (Associated Press) \n \n Oscar Pistorius, second from right, accompanied by a relative arrives at the high court in Pretoria, South Africa, Thursday, Aug. 7, 2014. On Thursday and Friday, both sides will summarize their versions... (Associated Press) \n \n Prosecutor Gerrie Nel made the allegation during final arguments in the sensational trial in a Pretoria courthouse, where the fathers of the Olympic runner and Steenkamp, a model and television personality, were in court for the first time since the trial began in early March. They sat at opposite ends of a long bench in the gallery. \n \n Nel said a criminal trial was a \"blunt instrument for digging up the truth\" but that he was confident of his case. He then said defense lawyers had argued that Pistorius acted in self-defense, fearing an intruder was in the house, but also raised the possibility that the once-celebrated athlete was not criminally responsible, accidentally shooting Steenkamp through a closed toilet door because he was \"startled.\" \n \n \"It's two defenses that you can never reconcile,\" Nel said. \n \n The prosecution has argued that Pistorius intentionally shot Steenkamp before dawn on Feb. 14, 2013 after a quarrel. The defense has previously contended that he fired by mistake, thinking he was about to be attacked by an assailant in the toilet and that Steenkamp was in the bedroom. \n \n In addition to the murder charge, Pistorius faces three separate gun-related charges, one of which stems from his alleged firing of a shot in a crowded restaurant called Tashas in Johannesburg, months before he killed Steenkamp. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. \n \n On Thursday, some of the state's written arguments as well as transcripts of past testimony appeared on screens in the courtroom. One section questioned Pistorius' defense case: \n \n \"Is it putative self-defense? Is it an act of sane automatism? Did he have criminal capacity to act? Or was it all an accident as in Tashas Restaurant where he had the gun in his hand and it purportedly discharged itself?\" \n \n Because South Africa has no trial by jury, Judge Thokozile Masipa will decide with the help of two legal assistants if Pistorius committed murder, is guilty of a negligent killing, or if he made a tragic error and should be acquitted. The runner faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted of premeditated murder, and also would be sent to prison for years if guilty of murder without premeditation or culpable homicide. \n \n Earlier, Masipa told Nel and chief defense lawyer Barry Roux that they had only until the end of Friday to complete their final arguments in court. \n \n \"Unless, of course, you want to work on a Saturday and perhaps Sunday, after church,\" she said, smiling. \n \n ___ \n \n Imray reported from Stellenbosch, South Africa. ||||| Look back at our rolling coverage as the prosecution presented its closing arguments in the trial of Oscar Pistorius for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The prosecution is laying out its closing arguments in Oscar Pistorius' monthslong murder trial today, with the defense expected to wrap things up tomorrow. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel, known as \"the pitbull,\" began by ripping into Pistorius' claims that he acted in self-defense when shooting Reeva Steenkamp\u2014who Pistorius says he thought was an intruder\u2014and that he was \"not criminally responsible\" for the shooting because he was \"startled,\" the AP reports. \"It's two defenses that you can never reconcile,\" Nel said. Pistorius never once said the shooting was an accident because he \"intended to kill,\" Nel said, per the Guardian. Nel noted that given the lack of imminent attack, Pistorius is still guilty of murder even if he did believe Steenkamp to be an intruder. Nel also drew attention to the contents of Steenkamp\u2019s stomach, which indicate she ate hours after Pistorius said the pair went to bed, and other inconsistencies in the runner's testimony. \"All these lies caught him up,\" Nel said. He also noted the defense never tried to disprove the claim that a neighbor heard a woman's raised voice an hour before the gunshots. As to the defense's claim that Pistorius' screams sound like a woman's, Nel said there is a recording of Pistorius screaming but the defense didn't present it because it doesn't support their version of events. Judge Thokozile Masipa will likely inform the court tomorrow of when her decision can be expected.",

    "document": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Deputy commissioner Nick Kaldas, NSW Police: \"We've certainly opened up the lines of communication\" \n \n Scotland Yard has been in touch with Australian police over the death of a nurse from the hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated for morning sickness. \n \n Jacintha Saldanha, 46, died on Friday, days after she answered a prank phone call from Australian DJs pretending to be the Queen and Prince Charles. \n \n An inquest into the apparent suicide is due to be opened this week. \n \n The DJs responsible have been taken off air and are receiving counselling. \n \n Southern Cross Austereo, owner of 2Day FM, held an emergency board meeting on Sunday, but made no comment afterwards. \n \n It has suspended all advertising on the station until Monday, while DJs Mel Greig and Michael Christian are on indefinite leave. \n \n The pair are said to be in a fragile condition and receiving \"intense counselling\", because of the hostile reaction to their prank. \n \n Meanwhile, the Duke of Cambridge has cancelled his appearance at the British Military Tournament at Earl's Court in London on Sunday. \n \n A St James's Palace spokesman said he would spend the day \"privately with the duchess instead\". \n \n Regarding official contact, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: \"Officers have been in contact with Australian authorities.\" \n \n Analysis Legal experts say that Australian DJs Mel Greig and Michael Christian are unlikely to be prosecuted at home or in the UK over the tragic royal hospital prank because they hadn't shown \"guilty intent.\" However, the radio pair may well have violated the Surveillance Devices Act in the state of New South Wales. It prohibits the broadcasting of private conversations acquired using a \"listening device\". Sanctions could also be imposed by the Australian Communications and Media Authority. It is investigating whether 2Day FM breached its licence conditions or industry rules. ACMA could strip the station of its right to broadcast, although that is unlikely. Station bosses continue to stress that no laws were broken and that the pre-recorded spoof interview had been scrutinised and approved by lawyers before it was aired. Any pain the commercial radio network will feel will probably be financial, in the short term at least. Several anxious advertisers have already abandoned 2Day FM in response to a largely hostile reaction from the Australian public. \n \n In certain circumstances, including when a death is sudden or unexpected, police report deaths to a coroner and can be involved in investigating the circumstances. \n \n The deputy commissioner for New South Wales Police, Nick Kaldas, said: \"They haven't actually asked us to do anything yet, but we've certainly opened up the lines of communication and obviously we're happy to assist in any way we can.\" \n \n He added: \"All I can say at the moment is that it's been indicated that the London Metropolitan Police may wish to speak to the people involved in the matter from 2Day FM. \n \n \"But we haven't been asked to do anything yet, and we certainly have not been asked to interview anyone, or line up any interviews for the Met.\" \n \n Legal experts say that the DJs are unlikely to be prosecuted in Australia or the UK because they had not shown \"guilty intent,\" reported BBC correspondent Phil Mercer in Sydney. \n \n However, the radio pair may well have violated the Surveillance Devices Act in the state of New South Wales. It prohibits the broadcasting of private conversations acquired using a \"listening device\". \n \n Station bosses say no laws were broken and that the pre-recorded spoof interview had been approved by lawyers before it was aired. \n \n The company board, including chairman Max Moore-Wilton, met on Sunday, but are not expected to release a statement until Monday. \n \n They discussed the strongly worded letter received from the chairman of King Edward VII's Hospital, where Catherine was being treated for acute morning sickness last week. \n \n In it, Lord Glenarthur said it was \"truly appalling\" that the call, in which Mrs Saldanha transfers the caller to the duchess' nurse believing it to be the Queen, was approved by radio management before broadcast. \n \n Image caption Jacintha Saldanha was married with two children \n \n Lord Glenarthur also said in his letter: \"The immediate consequence of these premeditated and ill-considered actions was the humiliation of two dedicated and caring nurses who were simply doing their job tending to their patients. \n \n \"The longer term consequence has been reported around the world and is, frankly, tragic beyond words.\" \n \n He urged Mr Moore-Wilton to ensure such an incident was never repeated. \n \n A bouquet of flowers was left outside the hospital accommodation where Mrs Saldanha was found on Friday. An attached note said: \"We bless your soul.\" \n \n While Mrs Saldanha's husband and two children were being comforted at their home in Bristol, her extended family in her native India were coming to terms with her death. \n \n Her sister-in-law told AFP news agency from south-west India: \"We were shocked to hear from her husband that Jacintha was no more. He did not tell us that she committed suicide.\" \n \n She added: \"Today we are going to the church to pray for her soul and for her children, who are going through a bad time.\" \n \n Royal College of Nursing chief executive Peter Carter said the death was \"a tragedy that was avoidable\". \n \n \"This is the fallout from these hoaxes. We've seen them in the past. Rarely does it have the dramatic effect that it has had on this occasion.\" ||||| The two DJs at the centre of the royal hospital hoax call tragedy \"have expressed a desire to speak\" to the media. \n \n Crisis talks are under way at the company that owns 2Day FM, whose presenters Mel Greig and Michael Christian duped Jacintha Saldanha into helping reveal details about the Duchess of Cambridge's health. \n \n It led to Ms Saldanha's apparent suicide days later. \n \n A spokesman for Southern Cross Austereo - 2Day FM's parent company - said: \"They have expressed a desire to speak. We haven't ascertained when they're ready for that and how we're going to organise that, but they certainly want to.\" \n \n Ms Saldanha was found dead days after the prank call \n \n The firm also said it was reviewing its broadcast processes. \n \n It comes as the Duke of Cambridge pulled out of attending the British Military Tournament on Sunday night so he can spend time with Kate. \n \n She is recuperating after receiving hospital treatment for severe morning sickness. \n \n The royal couple had both originally been due to attend tonight's event, billed as \"the largest display of military theatre in the world\". \n \n But all of Kate's forthcoming public engagements were cancelled after she spent three nights at the King Edward VII's Hospital suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum. \n \n A St James's Palace spokesman said: \"The Duke of Cambridge will no longer attend the British Military Tournament at Earl's Court this evening, but will spend Sunday privately with the Duchess instead. \n \n \"It is well known that hyperemesis gravidarum often recurs and, until further notice, to allow the Duchess a degree of privacy during her pregnancy, we do not intend to offer regular condition checks or advise of routine developments associated with it.\" \n \n Meanwhile police in Australia have been contacted by Scotland Yard over the death of Ms Saldanha. \n \n New South Wales Police Deputy Commissioner Nick Kaldas said officers had been in touch - but emphasised there was no suggestion that a crime had been committed. \n \n He said: \"There has been a request for assistance from London's Metropolitan Police to the New South Wales Police through the Australian Federal Police. \n \n \"The request has gone to the city central command - the area where the 2Day FM office is.\" \n \n The radio station has responded in writing to a strongly worded protest from the hospital about the prank. The hospital accused the station of humiliating the tragic nurse in the \"appalling\" stunt. \n \n The radio station response reads: \"We are all saddened by the events of the last few days. They are truly tragic. \n \n \"It is too early to know the full details leading to this tragic event and we are anxious to review the results of any investigation that may be madeavailable to us or made public. \n \n \"We can assure you that we will fully cooperate with all investigations. As we have said in our own statements on the matter, the outcome was unforeseeable and very regrettable. \n \n \"I can assure you we are taking immediate action and reviewing the broadcast processes involved. \n \n \"Our company joins with you, all at the King Edward VII's Hospital and Mrs Saldanha's family and friends in mourning their tragic loss.\"",

She added that she\u2019d be there in the future to help Melania or Ivanka \u2014 if they want her assistance. \n \n Fallon also showed a pre-taped video of passerbys that he invited to record thank you messages for the first lady. After each one, the first lady popped from behind the curtain and surprised the overwhelmed fans with big hugs. \n \n Fallon has created some viral video moments with both Obamas through the years.

Amit Mehra \n \n Obesity has been identified as a life-threatening condition among human beings. But as officials in the Delhi zoo have realised over the last year, it can stall life in the animal kingdom too. That\u2019s why they are returning Salman, a 12-year-old jaguar, to Kerala with this stinging verdict: \u201che\u2019s too fat to breed\u201d. \n \n Salman was borrowed on a \u201cbreeding loan\u201d from the Thiruvananthapuram Zoological Garden last October, but has since shown \u201ccomplete disinterest\u201d in pairing up with the lone female jaguar in the National Zoological Park here, say Delhi zoo officials. They say Salman has \u201creached out for its meals more keenly than for Kalpana\u201d, the female jaguar. \n \n \u201cHe was brought on a breeding loan but it has been over a year and Salman has shown no interest in mating. In fact, the female is seen trying to entice him but he lies in a corner and refuses to respond. He is too fat to breed,\u201d Delhi zoo curator Riaz Khan told The Indian Express. \n \n \u201cNow we know for sure nothing is going to happen. So it is best that we send him back home. He was brought for a purpose and if he is not fulfilling that purpose then what is the point in keeping him here?\u201d Khan said. \n \n Although no scientific tests have been done to establish the case against Salman, some zoo officials are inclined to take his side, arguing that the two other male jaguars, Mohan and Shankar, have also failed to give Kalpana a cub. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily about obesity. In some cases, animals that are proven breeders stop after relocation,\u201d said a wildlife expert at the Delhi zoo, who did not wish to be named. \n \n But the counter-argument from Khan and the others is that unlike the other two, Salman has not even shown any interest in mating after reaching Delhi on October 20, 2014. \u201cHe is lazy, a glutton, just loves to eat and relax,\u201d said one of Salman\u2019s caretakers. \n \n \u201cEvery morning, we find leftovers in the cages of the other jaguars but this one polishes off his entire food. I am sure if we gave him more food, he would finish off that too. He has a bigger appetite than the tigers here,\u201d he said. \n \n All the four jaguars in Delhi\u2019s zoo are given approximately 6 kg of buffalo meat daily, and for a while zoo staff tried their best to win this battle of the bulge. \n \n \u201cSalman was put on a strict diet but showed no signs of losing weight and had to be brought back to the usual ration,\u201d said the caretaker. They also tried releasing him into the larger enclosure more often, hoping he would play around and get some exercise. \u201cBut he would stroll for a bit, then lie in a corner,\u201d the caretaker said. \n \n Salman\u2019s weight has not been officially measured yet, but at the time of relocation, the Thiruvananthapuram zoo had certified that he was \u201cfit\u201d. \n \n Last month, officials from the Thiruvananthapuram zoo offered to take Salman back with them when they were in Delhi to accept a white tiger as part of another programme. But the Delhi zoo decided to hold him back till the one-year loan period ends \u2014 \u201choping against hope\u201d. \n \n For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now",

But a week later, he was swamped by orders, leading him to put the whole thing up for sale in an attempt to rid himself of what he described as a \u201chorrible product\u201d. \n \n The site was sold on Flippa, an online marketplace where entrepreneurs can trade in start-ups, domains or toolkits for building a business from scratch. Bidding rapidly rose to $70,000 in the first days on sale, before stalling until the last hours, when a further $15,000 was added on the price. \n \n The buyer, who is currently anonymous, is believed to be legitimate, having spent $83,000 on the site previously. \n \n In the four days Carpenter ran the site, he says he took more than $20,000 in sales, far beyond what he was expecting for a website launched \u201cas a bit of a joke\u201d. As a result, he closed the ability to make new orders, and later decided to be shot of the whole site. \n \n The site gained fame, in part, because of its tone. \u201cWe fucking hate glitter,\u201d is how its pitch opens. \u201cPeople call it the herpes of the craft world. What we hate more, though, are the soulless people who get their jollies off by sending glitter in envelopes.\u201d \n \n Shortly before closing orders, he took to start-up news site Product Hunt to ask potential users to stop. \u201cHi guys, I\u2019m the founder of this website.

Today, he's apparently sold the fledgling business for a casual $85,000. \n \n The catchy idea \u2013 simple, clever, provides a great instant visual \u2013and the spot-on nature of Carpenter's copy (glitter is so obviously, as he writes, \"the herpes of the craft world\") combined to elevate the bare-bones website into a viral sensation. \n \n Orders began flooding in.

You guys have a sick fascination with shipping people glitter. We've received all orders & working through them. There was a ton so be patient. You can spam me on Twitter for updates@matcarpenter or like the website on Facebook. \n \n Related: We Should Never Forgive the Horror of ShipYourEnemiesGlitter ||||| About the seller: \n \n Name: Mathew Carpenter \n \n Location: Newcastle, Australia \n \n Background: I\u2019m a 22 year old entrepreneur that has been building websites for the past 5 years. \n \n Site Description \n \n ShipYourEnemiesGlitter.com is a website that allows users to purchase an envelope filled with glitter that is sent to one of their enemies for only $9.99. Although the idea is a bit farfetched, it\u2019s caught on in a big way. After being launched on January 12th of this month it has seen over 2,500,000 visitors, received over 415,000 mentions on Facebook & Twitter & has been featured all over the world both online, in print, on the radio, on TV & even on late night talkshows. \n \n After being online for only a few hours, the website had received over 2,000 orders generating just over $20,000AUD. Somewhat overwhelmed, I then decided to take the ability to order down despite receiving thousands of emails & tweets from people wanting to purchase. \n \n Business Model \n \n The website\u2019s purpose is for people to send glitter to people they dislike or people they just want to play a funny prank on. A user comes onto the website, fills out a very simple form, pays the $9.99 fee via PayPal & I receive the recipient\u2019s name & address. From there, I print out an A4 letter which basically tells the person receiving the glitter that they\u2019re a terrible person. I then fold up the letter with glitter sprinkled all over it, put it in an envelope & ship it off to the recipient. \n \n The new owner may decide to print out the A4 letters wholesale and improve the margins, same deal with the envelopes & glitter \u2013 however, I\u2019ve just been purchasing everything from a local store. \n \n Monetization \n \n \n \n The website makes money every time a user purchases a glitter filled envelope. Each purchase is worth $9.99AUD. I\u2019ve calculated that the total cost of shipping an envelope filled with the glitter & the A4 letter to most places in the world from Australia ranges anywhere from $2-$4. That leaves $5.99 to $7.99 profit on each order. \n \n Time Requirement \n \n \n \n The new owner will have to decide whether or not they want to ship the envelopes themselves or outsource to a 3rd party. I have received hundreds of emails from people who would like to ship for us for a small fee. I\u2019ve also received emails from manufacturers & factories that have the capabilities to do this on a very large scale. I\u2019ll share these with the new owner, and if the new owner decides to outsource, the monthly time requirement will be close to 0. \n \n If the new owner wants to ship the envelopes themselves, then the monthly time requirement will be a bit more and will be based on the speed of putting glitter into envelopes, sending at the post office etc. \n \n Marketing \n \n \n \n The only marketing that has been done was when I launched which included sending out a Tweet from my own personal Twitter account. I also posted the website to Product Hunt. From there, coverage of the site exploded. The great thing about this website & the marketing surrounding it is that the readers on the publications that post about the site love it! On most of the publications the story has been their most popular of the day & many outlets have continued reporting about the site multiple times. \n \n Just a few of the major online media publications that have written about the site include: \n \n What is being included in the sale? \n \n Included in the sale are the website & all of its files, the domain name & I\u2019ll also forward the emails from people requesting interviews & asking when the site will be taking orders again. \n \n Future Opportunities \n \n This website & brand have a lot of potential. The new owner will be able to reopen the floodgates by putting the order form back up on the website. They will also be able to respond to the many press enquiries. That\u2019s short term though. In the long-term introducing other annoying products for users to send is something that could be done. There\u2019s also the opportunity to allow users to send customized notes for an additional charge \u2013 there really is a lot to explore here. \n \n \n \n In the a4 letter that's included in each envelope, the URL is at the very bottom of it. For the new owner they can add their own message, so say they add \"get revenge by shipping glitter to your own enemies at ShipYourEnemiesGlitter.com.\" - basically, there's branding on each letter which will keep people coming back for more again and again. Finally, with the coverage the site has received, and the media contacts I've accumulated, the new owner will be able to test things on a large scale. \n \n What makes this website better than its competitors? \n \n When the website was launched we had 0 competitors. After a day or two the clones started to appear which I find hilarious. The majority of the clones are terribly designed, lack any sort of entertaining copy & mention my website. Simply put, we\u2019re the leader in this space, and the media coverage of our site proves it. \n \n Why is the business being sold? \n \n I launched this website as a bit of a joke not expecting this level of attention. Heck, I launched this website whilst I was on holiday! For the past few days it has been stressful dealing with all of the media attention & even more so because this was only intended to be a small side project. It\u2019s taken on a life of its own, and I want to watch it continue to grow under a new owner. \n \n Post Sale \n \n I\u2019m willing to sign a 3 year non-compete contract. I\u2019ll also be happy to provide 30 days of after sale support & training to ensure that the buyer is able to fully take over the website and there is a smooth transition. \n \n Closing Remarks \n \n The website is less than a week old & has received press from virtually every major online publication. If you do a search in Google for \u201cshipyourenemiesglitter.com\u201d despite only being a few days old, the site already garners \u201cAbout 1,620,000 results\u201d. \n \n Along with the online websites, we\u2019ve been featured on a ton of radio stations, TV shows, podcasts, print & my favorite so far: Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. \n \n \n \n Serious bidders only! Happy bidding!",

Other crucial reception items included a punch bowl, forks and spoons, and, in a sign that there's nothing like one-stop shopping, a polo shirt and Gillette Fusion razor blades. The most brainiac part? According to the criminal complaint, the duo pushed one cart out of the store ... then went right back in and starting filling up a second cart. The Centre Daily Times reports that when police arrested the pair, they also found a pipe with pot residue in the couple's car. The groom apparently took the fall for his new bride, and was charged with possession of drug paraphernalia; both were hit with theft-related charges.",

    "document": "The chemical chain of events that led to the origin of life on Earth is likely forever lost to the mists of time. But some of our earliest ancestors\u2014including the microbial Eve from which all modern cells descended\u2014left behind traces in the genes they passed to their descendants. To track these shared genes, geneticists have surveyed nearly 2000 genomes of modern microbes. Now, researchers report that they\u2019ve used this sort of genome mining to reveal new insights about the daily life of our last universal common ancestor, or LUCA. The results suggest that LUCA was a heat-loving microbe that fed on hydrogen gas and lived in a world devoid of oxygen, bolstering strong suspicions that life on Earth formed in and around hydrothermal vents such as those found near undersea volcanoes. \n \n Today, the cells that make up all life on Earth are clustered into three broad groups: bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. The first two comprise prokaryotes\u2014cells without a nucleus. A distant union between these two formed eukaryotes\u2014cells with a nucleus that make up all the complex multicellular organisms including plants and animals. \n \n Genetic studies to date have revealed some tantalizing clues about LUCA. Most evidence suggests that, like modern cells, LUCA stored genetic information using DNA. It also built proteins and used adenosine triphosphate as its currency for energy. But it has been harder for geneticists to know other details of LUCA\u2019s lifestyle. One major complication: Microbes not only pass genes to their progeny, but also swap them among their neighbors in a process called horizontal gene transfer. This makes it hard to tell whether genes shared by separate microbes reflect a shared lineage or whether some bugs were just better at spreading their genetic material far and wide. And that makes it harder to pin down LUCA\u2019s lifestyle. \n \n To get closer to doing just that, researchers led by William Martin, an evolutionary biologist at Heinrich Heine University in Dusseldorf, Germany, took a more stringent approach to identifying genes that were likely inherited. Rather than looking for genes shared by a single species bacteria and archaea, they searched for those shared by at least two species of bacteria and two archaea. This gave them an initial count of some 6 million genes grouped into more than 286,000 related gene families. Further analysis revealed that only 355 of these gene families were broadly distributed across all modern organisms, and thus could be tracked from an ancestral species through all of its descendants. That made the 355 gene families likely LUCA candidates. \n \n As Martin and his colleagues report in today\u2019s issue of Nature Microbiology , these genes aren\u2019t randomly scattered throughout modern organisms, but fall into distinct groups that reflect LUCA\u2019s likely metabolism. Most notably, they reveal that LUCA was an anaerobe that grew in an environment devoid of the oxygen that most cells today require. That jibes with what scientists know about Earth 4 billion years ago, a period known as the late heavy bombardment. Not long after the planet\u2019s formation, meteors and comets rained steadily down, the seas periodically boiled away, and the atmosphere lacked oxygen. The gene scans also show that LUCA was almost certainly a heat-loving \u201cthermophile\u201d that fed on hydrogen gas (H 2 ), as others have proposed. Today, many microbes produce H 2 . But because LUCA preceded them, it would have had to belly up to a geological source of hydrogen, such as a hydrothermal vent like those found near an undersea volcano. ||||| The concept of a last universal common ancestor of all cells (LUCA, or the progenote) is central to the study of early evolution and life's origin, yet information about how and where LUCA lived is lacking. We investigated all clusters and phylogenetic trees for 6.1 million protein coding genes from sequenced prokaryotic genomes in order to reconstruct the microbial ecology of LUCA. Among 286,514 protein clusters, we identified 355 protein families (\u223c0.1%) that trace to LUCA by phylogenetic criteria. Because these proteins are not universally distributed, they can shed light on LUCA's physiology. Their functions, properties and prosthetic groups depict LUCA as anaerobic, CO 2 -fixing, H 2 -dependent with a Wood\u2013Ljungdahl pathway, N 2 -fixing and thermophilic. LUCA's biochemistry was replete with FeS clusters and radical reaction mechanisms. Its cofactors reveal dependence upon transition metals, flavins, S-adenosyl methionine, coenzyme A, ferredoxin, molybdopterin, corrins and selenium. Its genetic code required nucleoside modifications and S-adenosyl methionine-dependent methylations. The 355 phylogenies identify clostridia and methanogens, whose modern lifestyles resemble that of LUCA, as basal among their respective domains. LUCA inhabited a geochemically active environment rich in H 2 , CO 2 and iron. The data support the theory of an autotrophic origin of life involving the Wood\u2013Ljungdahl pathway in a hydrothermal setting. ||||| A surprisingly specific genetic portrait of the ancestor of all living things has been generated by scientists who say that the likeness sheds considerable light on the mystery of how life first emerged on Earth. \n \n This venerable ancestor was a single-cell, bacterium-like organism. But it has a grand name, or at least an acronym. It is known as Luca, the Last Universal Common Ancestor, and is estimated to have lived some four billion years ago, when Earth was a mere 560 million years old. \n \n The new finding sharpens the debate between those who believe life began in some extreme environment, such as in deep sea vents or the flanks of volcanoes, and others who favor more normal settings, such as the \u201cwarm little pond\u201d proposed by Darwin. \n \n The nature of the earliest ancestor of all living things has long been uncertain because the three great domains of life seemed to have no common point of origin. The domains are those of the bacteria, the archaea and the eukaryotes. Archaea are bacteria-like organisms but with a different metabolism, and the eukaryotes include all plants and animals.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The first name on your family tree\u2014in fact, on the family tree of every living creature\u2014should technically be LUCA. As the New York Times explains, the acronym stands for the Last Universal Common Ancestor, an organism that lived about 4 billion years ago and became the ancestor of all life forms. Now, a new study in Nature Microbiology provides what its authors say is evidence that settles the debate about where this first life began: near hydrothermal vents, like those found near deep-sea volcanoes. Researchers at Germany's Heinrich Heine University say their genetic sleuthing has revealed that LUCA was tailor-made to live in such an environment\u2014it was essentially \"a heat-loving microbe that fed on hydrogen gas and lived in a world devoid of oxygen,\" in the words of Science. To figure out this genetic profile, the scientists examined 6 million genes associated with two simple and ancient forms of life, bacteria and archaea. After identifying genes that were shared between the two groups, they whittled the figure down to 355 gene families that met their criteria for having originated in LUCA, their joint ancestor. \u201cIt was flabbergasting to us that we found as many as we did,\u201d says lead researcher William Martin. This smaller group of genes allowed them to create a snapshot of sorts of LUCA, one hailed as \"remarkable\" by a UCLA evolutionary biologist. But don't expect the debate to end.

There are others who believe he should get a special Nobel just for being Bob Dylan \n \n In the latest of many distinctions garlanding a career stretching back five-and-a-half decades, Bob Dylan has become the first member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to win the Nobel prize in literature. Some will argue against the award, as they argued against him in the long and infinitely tiresome Dylan v Keats controversy, and as others have contested the meaning and value of every phase and nuance of his output. Others will feel that he deserves the creation of a special Nobel prize simply for being Bob Dylan, however that condition is defined. \n \n Pop lyrics aren't literature? Tell that to Nobel prize winner Bob Dylan Read more \n \n So, to confront the familiar argument, can what he does be called literature? And if he is being judged on literary grounds, should Tarantula, his \u201cnovel\u201d of the mid-60s (started and abandoned in 1965, widely bootlegged and finally published officially in 1971), be taken as evidence? His fans know the first line by heart \u2013 \u201cAretha / Crystal jukebox queen of hymn & him\u201d \u2013 but few reached the end. There was no music, as Dylan himself must have realised when he set it aside. \n \n Essentially, in the work of Bob Dylan, the words and the music cannot be separated. Just take your favourite Dylan line. Yours might be the ever timely \u201cWhere preachers preach of evil fates / Teachers teach that knowledge waits / Can lead to hundred-dollar plates / Goodness hides behind its gates / But even the president of the United States / Sometimes must have to stand naked\u201d, from It\u2019s Alright, Ma (I\u2019m Only Bleeding) in 1965. Or the eternal \u201cAin\u2019t it just like the night to play tricks when you\u2019re trying to be so quiet?\u201d (Visions of Johanna, 1966) or the mysterious \u201cTwo riders were approaching / The wind began to howl\u201d (All Along the Watchtower, 1968). Whichever it is, when you say them to yourself, as we all do in times of need, you\u2019ll be hearing his voice, his sound, his music. \n \n Mine \u2013 at this moment, anyway, because the choice is bound to change from time to time when the library is so vast and rich \u2013 happens to be a simple line from Brownsville Girl, an 11-minute epic he co-wrote with Sam Shepard in 1986: \u201cStrange how people who suffer together have stronger connections than people who are most content.\u201d This is not \u201cliterary\u201d, or poetic by his former standards. There is no \u201cmidnight\u2019s broken toll\u201d or \u201cgeometry of innocence\u201d. Dylan phrases it so perfectly in a single breath that the meaning is rendered starkly and with profound resonance. That\u2019s what he does. \n \n The admirable delicacy of the Nobel committee\u2019s citation \u2013 \u201cfor having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition\u201d \u2013 will certainly have provoked a buzz among analysts of Dylan\u2019s career. For one thing, the last two albums released by a man now in his 76th year consisted entirely of material drawn from what has become known as the Great American Songbook: compositions by the very Broadway tunesmiths, in fact, who Dylan the songwriter seemed in the eyes of his own generation to have been invented to destroy. Dylan, however, has always been fond of turning his own iconoclasm on the idea of iconoclasm itself, his protests against being called a protest singer just one example of that refusal to conform to even the freshest of stereotypes. \n \n Similarly, he never wanted to tear down the walls of Tin Pan Alley. That was an inference drawn by others, useful in the early phase of his career, when he drew from what he had heard in the collection of antique songs on Harry Smith\u2019s Anthology of American Folk Music \u2013 the ballads and blues, the music of hard times \u2013 and somehow infused it all with the onrushing anti-authoritarian, anti-deferential spirit of his own era. \n \n As the Nobel citation correctly suggests, Dylan knitted himself \u2013 without anyone realising it, perhaps even him\u2013 into the warp and weft of American popular music. Borrowing wholesale from the past, reshuffling melodies, images, characters and attitudes, he helped assemble the components of a rapidly changing present. \n \n Fifty years ago he used a fairly minor motorcycle accident as an excuse to step away from the spotlight. But the end of the \u201cperfect\u201d Dylan \u2013 the one who fused what he had learnt from Woody Guthrie and the symbolist poets with the energy of rock\u2019n\u2019roll, and who mocked the world from behind impenetrable shades \u2013 did not mean the end of his creativity. In songs such as Tangled Up in Blue (1975), Blind Willie McTell (1983) and Cross the Green Mountain (2002) he explored ways of playing games with time, voice and perspective, continuing to expand the possibilities of song in ways that disarm all possible criticism of this new and perhaps greatest honour. ||||| Story highlights Jay Parini: Bob Dylan has written songs that speak to our deepest concerns \n \n Other singers have summed up a generation, but Dylan wrote words to his songs, he says \n \n Jay Parini, a poet and novelist, teaches at Middlebury College. His most recent book is \"New and Collected Poems, 1975-2015.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. \n \n (CNN) From the early '60s to today, decade after decade, Bob Dylan, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, has filled our heads with language that both interprets and transforms the realities we confront. I've gone to sleep many nights with stanzas of Dylan floating in my head, the words attached to the haunting notes. \"Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now,\" I often say to myself, taking the line from \"My Back Pages.\" \n \n Popular singers have meant a great deal to generations before: Crosby, Sinatra and Elvis Presley come to mind. But Dylan actually wrote the words he sang. \n \n And not just sweet love poems. Dylan challenged us again and again: \"How many deaths will it take till they know / That too many people have died?\" Those words underscored, even explained, my reaction to the Vietnam War. It brought up echoes of countless deaths in the name of freedom, and has been something of a battle cry for me personally ever since. Too many people have died, and it's worth putting every ounce of energy we have into trying to ease the catastrophe. \n \n One can't even begin to explain the ferocity and magic of \"Desolation Row,\" where he alludes to Eliot and Pound \"fighting in the captain's tower.\" One sensed that Dylan was there with the captains, himself an officer in the poetic ranks, struggling to express the fear and loneliness that besets us all. And he did so in his usual antic style, matching and mixing allusions from a broad range of sources, from fairy tales to science, from the Bible to Shakespeare. \n \n The political strand in his work has often been noted, with so many vivid lines -- as in \"It's Alright, Ma,\" where he cries: \"Even the president of the United States / Sometimes must have to stand naked.\" Can this ever have seemed more relevant? \n \n Read More ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Let's say that Bob Dylan had passed away in his early to mid-thirties, as would have befitted the Christ-like figure his most fanatical admirers consider him to be. He would have released Blood On The Tracks in 1975, and completed Desire, the second masterpiece from his middle period, which appeared the following year. Disciples would never have had to struggle with his distinctive readings of songs such as \"Froggie Went A-Courtin'\", \"The Little Drummer Boy\", or \"Here Comes Santa Claus\". They would have been spared the need to follow him to places like Bournemouth, Limoges and Spokane, to hear him revisit his classic compositions in a voice that, on a bad night, has the timbre of a cracked bell. \n \n The fog of secrecy that surrounds his life would long since have lifted. \n \n There would have been little point in devoted admirers rehearsing, as so many have, questions he might answer concerning his lyrics. \"When you wrote that line, Bob, about 40 red, white and blue shoe strings, did you mean 40 striped laces, or 13 red, 13 white and 14 blue?\" And did you really have a job in the great north woods [as you wrote in 'Tangled Up In Blue'] 'working as a cook for a spell'? What were the specials? Who was your sous chef?\" And - this next question was actually put to him by his former Boswell and occasional collaborator, Larry \"Ratso\" Sloman, concerning Dylan's sublime 1966 love song \"Sad Eyed Lady Of The Lowlands\" - \"In the chorus, 'My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums'... That word, 'eyes'. What is it? A noun, or a verb? \n \n Advertisement \n \n The constant need to explain his work - a curse Bob Dylan has bemoaned for 50 years - would be over, as would the need to avoid the attentions of his more unhinged fans. Gone, too, all those fatiguing enquiries concerning his alleged lovers, opiate use and undignified stories such as those recent reports about neighbours to his main residence, in Malibu, complaining about the odour emanating from his workers' Portaloos, with predictable headlines such as \"Blowin' In The Wind\". On a superficial level, at least, everybody wins. \n \n Dylan, though, remains obstinately fit and industrious, and celebrates his 70th birthday in May. In 2006, after a frustratingly inconsistent run of albums over the previous three decades (disappointing enough at certain points, such as his \"born-again\" period in the early Eighties, to convince some that his talent had deserted him forever) he produced the triumphant Modern Times. It's the best thing he's done, I suggested to one of his compatriots (a household name who, like many I interviewed for this article, insisted on remaining anonymous) since Desire. \"It's the best thing he's done,\" came the reply, \"since Blood On The Tracks.\" That renaissance has been sustained with 2009's \n \n Read next The first... with Kojo Funds The first... with Kojo Funds Kojo Funds talks getting drunk, his first rider and cheating on his barber \n \n Together Through Life.

Everybody who does my job exists in the shadow of Bob Dylan. There are two categories: Dylan and everybody else. It's as simple as that. And it's going to be that way until he dies.\" \n \n It could be that, because you have somehow grown up beyond the reach of English- speaking popular culture - you are now asking: who exactly is Bob Dylan? On a literal level, the question is a straightforward one. Born Robert Zimmerman on 24 May 1941, in Duluth, Minnesota, he first used his new name in 1960 and emerged as an unrivalled talent in the New York folk clubs. Most agree that he has enjoyed three especially brilliant periods: first as an acoustic artist, with protest anthems such as \"The Times They are A-Changin'\", in the early Sixties; then with his great electric trilogy, Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde On Blonde, in the middle years of that decade; and finally the more introspective work of his \n \n Blood On The Tracks period in the mid-Seventies. Fans argue as to just when his current, fourth great flowering began, but there's a broad consensus that, in the studio at least, it is ongoing. \n \n Read next The songs that made 2018 worthwhile type-gallery The songs that made 2018 worthwhile Out of despair came the hits \n \n PA Photos \n \n Advertisement \n \n His voice may, like the Havana cigars and bourbon to which it is often lazily compared, be an acquired taste, but Dylan is responsible, as much as Billie Holiday, for reinventing the whole style of popular singing. The idea that, even now his vocal range has been significantly reduced, Bob Dylan \"can't sing\" is simply wrong. In the words of his friend Bono: \"Almost no one sings like Elvis Presley any more. \n \n Hundreds try to sing like Dylan. To understand his impact as a singer, you have to imagine a world without Tom Waits, Kurt Cobain, Bruce Springsteen, Lucinda Williams or any other vocalist with a cracked voice, dirt-bowl yelp or bluesy street howl.\" \n \n For a journalist, the world of Dylan is not exactly the most comfortable to inhabit. In a landscape famous for its uncertainties, one thing is terribly clear: the subject himself doesn't want you anywhere near him. It's true that there are individuals who are more reclusive - astronaut Neil Armstrong, or author Thomas Pynchon spring to mind - but generally speaking those people have the decency never to go out. Dylan, meanwhile, circles the globe on his so-called Never Ending Tour. While researching this article, travelling across Europe and America, watching his shows and interviewing musicians, one question kept recurring. What kind of hermit is it who won't stay in his cave? \n \n The closer anybody is to Bob Dylan, the less enthusiasm they have for speaking about him. It's no exaggeration to say that something akin to the Mafia tradition of omert\u00e0 surrounds him. Elvis Costello, who has toured with Dylan, agreed to cooperate with this article only if his contribution was drawn from an on-the-record e-mail exchange. One source who's known Bob Dylan for many years was quite happy to tell me, in some detail, about how he'd been arrested for punching his wife. When Bob Dylan's name came up, though, his mood altered. \"You don't talk about Bob,\" he said. \"That's the rule.\" \n \n Read next Ten life lessons from The Rolling Stones Ten life lessons from The Rolling Stones As well as imparting countless rock & roll classics upon the world, The Rolling Stones have taught us plenty too \n \n Dylan's manager Jeff Rosen remained a helpful contact; if I wanted to see a concert in London or Marseille, I knew that when I got to the venue, tickets would be waiting. But he made two things clear from the start, namely that, \"I never talk about Mr Dylan,\" and, \"Mr Dylan doesn't give press interviews.\" \n \n This last statement, as aficionados will know, is only intermittently true, even though the nearest I will get to Dylan is being put through to someone who has him on their other phone line. \n \n In the mid-Nineties, I spent a couple of days interviewing Allen Ginsberg at his apartment in New York. \"You wanna talk to anyone else?\" Ginsberg asked. \"Burroughs? Corso? Dylan?\" \n \n Ginsberg dialled the calls. The first two writers spoke to me, even if, in poet Gregory Corso's case, what he said was barely recognisable as English. The third call rang out. Ginsberg left a message which, he assured me later, was eventually returned. \n \n Bob Dylan has become incrementally trickier to reach in recent years, though he will very rarely emerge, rather in the way that God occasionally appears to Portuguese virgins. Dylan, on the other hand, usually manifests himself in the presence of representatives of Rolling Stone magazine (which judged his 1965 classic \"Like A Rolling Stone\" to be the greatest song of the 20th century). At the time of writing, he last surfaced in its pages two years ago, when he spoke to Hunter S Thompson's authorised biographer, Douglas Brinkley. \n \n Read next Meet Jonas Blue, the DJ behind this year\u2019s biggest pop bangers Meet Jonas Blue, the DJ behind this year\u2019s biggest pop bangers The DJ on his fail-safe formula for pop success and working in a bar with Sam Smith pre-fame. \n \n As is mandatory, that conversation broached none of the more sensitive areas a subject might normally discuss with an interviewer, though the singer did make a few fascinating observations, notably in relation to a meeting with Nicolas Sarkozy. \"It was like looking at my mirror image,\" Bob Dylan said - a surprising remark, given Sarkozy's undistinguished record in certain areas: I'm thinking mainly of things like truth, dignity, tact, aggression towards strangers, intimidation of the media, marital fidelity, connivance with big business and loyalty to friends whose success might impede his own self-advancement. \"I can see,\" Dylan enthused, \"why he is the head of France.\" Sarkozy, he went on, is \"warm and extremely likeable\". (\"In exactly the same way,\" you expect the singer to conclude, \"that I am.\") \n \n In terms of Dylan's recent history with the press, examples of such affability are elusive. The last interviewer who attempted to address Dylan like a normal human being was Andy Kershaw, on The Old Grey Whistle Test in November 1985, a gesture unreciprocated by his guest who terminated what was an excruciating if memorable collision. \n \n Such temerity is rare, as my friend the Portland cartoonist John Callahan once told me. Dylan was one of the few stars with the curiosity to have sought out Callahan's work (the level of taste in the quadriplegic's art is typified by the title of his autobiography: Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far On Foot). \"He met me backstage,\" said Callahan, who died last year. \"I steered my wheelchair towards him. He said, 'Hallo.' And I found myself saying, 'I write songs, too.' That's like meeting Jesus Christ and telling him: 'I, too, have suffered at the hands of mine enemies.'\" \n \n On the whole, trying to talk to Bob Dylan is a bit like trying to talk to Jesus, with the important difference that prayer won't help you. And, as with Jesus, we each have our own personal relationship with Bob. My own is coloured by the fact that I live in Crouch End, an area of north London he used to explore fairly regularly. I've never met Dylan, but the guy who runs my local Indian has. So has the barmaid in my local, and a lady who sold a house two streets away from me. (The eventual purchaser was GQ restaurant reviewer Simon Kelner.) The vendor saw, \"this Jewish guy on the doorstep. He said: 'Don't change the taps.' The fittings were garish, styled in what the less politically correct would call \"Saudi gold\". Dylan pulled out of the deal when he found himself on the front page of the Hornsey Journal. The table opposite me at Banners Cafe, where I'm correcting this on a laptop, has a brass plaque that reads \" Bob Dylan Sat Here, 1993\". \n \n PA Photos \n \n Read next The first... with Sam Fender The first... with Sam Fender From the first time Sam Fender had his heart broken to the first time he threw a punch \n \n His legendary disdain for the media inspired a play by writer Janey Preger, Bobby Wants To Meet Me. Broadcast on BBC2 in 1981, its main character was Neville Morris, a Mancunian journalist and Dylan obsessive who has been hoaxed into believing he has an interview with the singer. It's Neville who invented that question about the multicoloured shoestrings, as part of his rehearsal to impress the artist. \"I'll tell him I'm an orphan,\" Morris says. \"My mother was Spanish. She was knifed by a jealous lover. I never knew my father but I was told he was a piano player. I was brought up by Moldovan horse traders. I travelled across Europe on horseback to Hamburg, where I hung out with a junkie stripper. I went to Greece where I lived on the street...\" \"Hang on,\" his girlfriend asks. \"How did you learn English?\" \"Salford Technical College,\" a friend mutters. \n \n In Marseille, a few days after I began my pilgrimage in June last year, the atmosphere in the lobby of Le D\u00f4me is like Wembley before the FA Cup final. There's a surprising mix of ages; many of the crowd are far too young to have seen Dylan perform in the early Nineties. His live shows weren't at their most consistent back then: one musician who played on those tours told me that he'd twice fallen asleep on stage with Dylan. I went to one London concert around that time with a long-standing fan who left after 20 minutes because Dylan's performance had reduced him to tears. The singer came on looking as if he'd just been hit over the head with a baseball bat. And Dylan, as I told Bucky Baxter (the guitarist credited with reinventing Bob Dylan's sound in the Nineties) appeared to be playing practical jokes on his band for his own amusement. \"He did do that,\" Baxter said. \"One night around that time, at Hammersmith, he was about to go into [his 1963 classic] 'Don't Think Twice, It's Alright'. He said, 'Hey, Bucky! Play mandolin on this.' I am not really a mandolin player; I could only play in certain keys. Halfway through, he stops the band, turns to the audience and points to me. He says: 'He isn't playing, he's miming.' And then: 'Should I fire him?' The whole audience yells, \n \n 'Yeah!' I went to see him afterwards. I was really p***ed off. He said: 'Forget it - I was just foolin' with ya.'\" \n \n Marseille, like the other dates I've seen on this tour, is different. True, Dylan, whose guitar-playing is rumoured to be restricted by arthritis, stands at his keyboard, at an oblique angle to an audience he does not trouble to acknowledge. He looks, as Joan Baez puts it, \"as though he'd rather be in a dark parlour, playing chess; perhaps in a sense he is.\" \n \n These days, Dylan has guitarist Charlie Sexton in the band, and while the singer may radiate indifference, Sexton, always a dynamic and compelling musician, is allowed to take centre stage. As a group performance it's extraordinary, and that, you feel, is how Dylan wants to appear: as a guy in the band. Sexton, who learned the basics of boxing in the Eighties under coach Bruce \"the Mouse\" \n \n Read next 15 not-boring questions with... Miles Kane 15 not-boring questions with...

They punch the air, tweeting the names of songs, four or five bars in. Matt, from County Durham, tells me he's saved up all year in order to spend his holiday following Dylan around. \"What did you think?\" I ask him, on the shuttle bus back into town. \"Great. F***ing great.\" \"Were you at the show last night?\" \"Nice? Yes. F***ing great, wasn't it?\" \"What did you think of Lyon?\" \"Lyon? Lyon was f***ing great. Every night,\" Matt says, \"is f***ing great.\" \n \n The next day I meet Matt at the airport, which is closed. He's looking to hitch a ride. \"I have to get to Barcelona. How long will that take by road?\" \"Barcelona? Why?\" \"What do you mean, why?\" He gives me the kind of look a member of the Inquisition might give someone who's carrying the Koran. \"You mean, you're not going?\" \n \n There is a side to some Bob Dylan fans that can, frankly, be unnerving, as I suggested to Mitch Blank, who I met in his Greenwich Village apartment. Blank, a grey-haired man in his sixties, is the semi-official archivist for Dylan's office. Blank is thanked as \"hypnotist collector\" on credits for things like the 2005 Scorsese Arena documentary No Direction Home (which Dylan maintains he's never seen; his only involvement with the project were the ten hours of interviews he recorded with manager Rosen). Blank's flat is full of Dylan memorabilia and thousands of hours of recordings. He has 9,000 open-reel tapes stored across the state line. Blank has spent recent days rescuing albums from the fire-damaged property of a deceased collector whose body had only recently been removed from the apartment, an exercise that required arc lights, masks and a dozen assistants. The smell, he says, was \"horrendous\". \n \n He shows me part of the case from the piano photographed on the cover of Dylan's 1975 studio album The Basement Tapes. \n \n Read next Glastonbury gives Kylie Minogue the chance to prove she is pop's greatest curator Glastonbury gives Kylie Minogue the chance to prove she is pop's greatest curator Nobody knows a hit better than her \n \n Dylanologists, Blank says, come from all over the world. \"They often ask if they can take a screw from the piano. It has become,\" he explains, \"mythological.\" \"Like the true cross?\" \"Right.\" \"What happens when they take a screw?\" \"I let them.\" \"What if you run out?\" \"I go to the hardware store and buy more. They leave happy.\" \n \n Years ago, Blank received a call from a fan. \"He said: 'Mitch, Bob was here. He smoked a pack of cigarettes. He's left the butts. You want one?'\" \n \n Blank asked why he'd want a cigarette end. \"In the future they say they'll be able to clone people from DNA. That means you can have your own Bob Dylan.\" \n \n There is, Blank tells me, \"a point where you have to draw the line\". \n \n Mark and Colleen Hayward/Redferns/Getty Images \n \n Read next What a GQ Editor might say having just been interrupted by Kurupt FM What a GQ Editor might say having just been interrupted by Kurupt FM The day People Just Do Nothing entered GQ \n \n Blank, who has a day job, is well-balanced.

Well, remember, tell the police that the guy who did it was... [name and address supplied].\" \n \n How on earth, you find yourself asking, did adulation for a Minnesota shopkeeper's son become so intense? Some years ago, at a retirement home in Phoenix, Arizona, I interviewed an elderly lady who'd been a friend of Beatty, Dylan's mother, in Hibbing, Minnesota. \"Such a sweet boy,\" she told me. \"He played in my yard. Well-behaved. A little shy.\" \n \n Back in London, I spoke to Philip Saville, the director responsible for, among other things, Alan Bleasdale's Boys From The Blackstuff. Saville directed The Madhouse On Castle Street, a BBC TV play transmitted in January 1963, now destroyed, itself the subject of an Arena documentary six years ago. \"I was in New York in 1961,\" Saville told me. \"I used to go to this music club; you'd meet WH Auden there, people like that. One night, this young man came on with a mouth organ and guitar. He was relatively unknown, then. I thought he was extraordinary.\" \n \n Back in London, Saville recalls, \"we were working on Madhouse, an Evan Jones play. I said, 'I'd love to get Bob Dylan for this.' I flew back to New York and we brought him over, with his manager Albert Grossman.\" \n \n Saville put Dylan in the May Fair Hotel, where he was thrown out for smoking weed. \"My wife and I had a house in Hampstead. He came to stay with us.\" Saville found Dylan sitting on the landing one day, singing \"Blowin' In The Wind\" to the au pairs. \"This,\" he says, \"was long before it was even recorded.\" \"What was he like back then?\" \"I adored him. He spent a lot of time in art galleries. Very forthright in his beliefs,\" says Saville, referring to Dylan's democratic libertarianism, \"though he wasn't a political animal, even then.\" (Years later, even George W Bush, a man who might have politicised anybody, would fail to elicit condemnation from Dylan.) \"Approachable?\" \"He didn't talk a lot. But people who say very little, especially if they pause, come across as more profound than they really are.\" \n \n Read next Watch the People Just Do Nothing characters hijack GQ Hype Watch the People Just Do Nothing characters hijack GQ Hype Consider this a Kurupt FM takeover \n \n Abram Zimmerman, Bob's father, ran a hardware store. His son adopted his new surname while in college at Minneapolis (almost certainly out of affection for Dylan Thomas). He was just 20 when Saville brought him over to London and still in thrall to his first great influence, Woody Guthrie, the Oklahoma folksinger whose Midwest accent and vagrant history he did his best to mimic. \n \n As late as October 1964, Dylan would be telling the distinguished critic Nat Hentoff - usually nobody's fool - that, as Hentoff wrote in the New Yorker: \"He ran away from home seven times - at ten, at 12, at 13, at 15, at 15-and-a-half, at 17 and at 18. His travels took in South Dakota, New Mexico, Kansas and California.\" \"Did he lie about his past?\" I ask Saville. \"No,\" the director says. \"He never claimed to be anything other than what he was: a nice, polite, middle-class Jewish boy.\" \n \n Philip Saville's recollections are in marked contrast to the tone of others who met him in England around this time. There are more than a thousand books relating solely, or in significant part, to Bob Dylan. One of the best is David Hadju's Positively 4th Street, which follows the young singer's relationship with Joan Baez, as well as with her sister Mimi and her husband, writer Richard Fari\u00f1a, who died in a motorbike accident in April 1966. \n \n Dylan does not emerge as an especially sympathetic figure; the many reverses he experienced in the battle to maintain monogamous relationships are recounted by Hadju and numerous other biographers, and alluded to rather more forgivingly in his own 2004 memoir, Chronicles: Volume One. He is pictured on the cover of The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan arm-in-arm with then girlfriend Suze Rotolo who, Dylan writes, \"had a smile that could light up a street full of people\" [not literally, of course, that would be hazardous]. He left Rotolo for Baez who, already a major star, made Dylan her lover and prot\u00e9g\u00e9. According to Baez, when Dylan told her he was leaving her to marry Sara Lownds,\"I didn't even know there was a Sara.\" \n \n Bob Dylan is known to have been married twice: to Sara (1965-1977) and to backing singer Carolyn Dennis (1986-1992). There have been a number of other significant girlfriends. He has four grown-up children from his marriage to Sara: Jesse, Anna Lea, Samuel and Jakob, and a daughter, Desiree, from his marriage to Carolyn. \n \n Read next Twelve exclusive images of Paul McCartney and Wings from the Seventies type-gallery Twelve exclusive images of Paul McCartney and Wings from the Seventies Pure style \n \n Dylan shared certain failings with fellow dandy Oscar Wilde: a propensity for occasional dissembling, minor plagiarism, reckless intoxication, infidelity and a sometimes cruel edge to his caustic wit, but with Dylan, as with Wilde, these sins are, if not excused, then brilliantly outshone by the work. \n \n There are other songwriters of his age whose legacy will endure: Randy Newman and Leonard Cohen prime among them. But whereas their work - however brilliant - has a polished, fundamentally orthodox quality, Dylan, at his stunning best, seems to be in touch with another reality. \n \n In Venice Beach, Los Angeles, I met Bruce Langhorne. Bruce played guitar for Dylan as early as Freewheelin' and was a regular collaborator up to and including Pat Garrett And Billy The Kid in 1973. He plays on \"Like A Rolling Stone\" and was the inspiration for, and played on, \"Mr Tambourine Man\", which Dylan wrote after seeing Langhorne at a party, playing a large Turkish drum. (\"If you had Bruce with you,\" Dylan remarked, \"that's all you would need to do just about anything.\") \"When I first heard Bobby,\" said Langhorne, \"I wasn't that impressed by his voice. Not at first. But he turned out to be extraordinary. He worked in a way that was very different from anything I'd ever experienced. The connection I had with Bobby was telepathic, and when I use that word, I mean it. I played on every song on Bringing It All Back Home. Some of those numbers were done in one or two takes. Everything with Bob was intuitive.\" \n \n Bruce shows me his copy of Chronicles. It's carefully inscribed, in the author's hand: \"To Bruce. It was better to be in chains with friends than in a garden with strangers. [An ancient Persian proverb.] \"So true, huh?

Mahalia Every week, we ask one rising star a set of quick-fire questions that all start with \u201cthe first\u201d \n \n Given Dylan's secretive nature, hearing that he was going to publish a memoir in 2004 felt a bit like being told that Lord Lucan would be next week's guest on Desert Island Discs. One distinguished British writer reviewed Chronicles as follows: \"If you are not weeping with gratitude by the end, then frankly the age has passed you by.\" I've read Chronicles six times now, and my handkerchief is still dry. I suspect the reviewer delivered this glowing endorsement in order to get his name on the cover of the paperback, and consequently must have been weeping for a second time when that edition finally appeared, and he found he had been out-grovelled by a man from the Daily Telegraph. \n \n Chronicles makes for fascinating reading but is extraordinarily devoid of emotion; very like Scorsese's No Direction Home, it is compelling in terms of musicology and folk history but, biographically speaking, a masterclass in the art of non-disclosure. Even his most fundamental relationships are blurred: Dylan mischievously refers to his spouse throughout Chronicles only as \"my wife\", making it impossible, in some passages, to know which one he's referring to. \n \n But how can you not forgive the man who wrote the following paragraph? \"The waitress came over and said, 'How about eating?' I looked at the menu then I looked at my wife. The one thing about her that I always loved was that she was never one of those people who thinks that someone else is the answer to their happiness. She has always had her own built-in happiness. I valued her opinion, and I trusted her. 'You order,' I said.\" \n \n Even Joan Baez, who was betrayed by Dylan on a number of levels, and who complains that he was \"rarely tender and seldom reached out to anticipate another's needs\", acknowledges that \"his humour was dry and splendid\". Dylan toured Britain in both 1965 and 1966. On the latter tour, ardent traditionalist John Cordwell, enraged by Dylan's second, amplified half of the set at Manchester Free Trade Hall, famously shouted \"Judas!\" at the singer. (This one critical moment in pop history is celebrated in two documentary studies: Like The Night, a tremendous book by CP Lee, and Ghosts Of Electricity, a 1999 BBC Radio 3 documentary made by Andy Kershaw.) \n \n In 1965, Dylan had been greeted by a national press who patronised him on the basis that a pop singer must, by definition, be less intelligent than they were: an assumption which, in Dylan's case, proved dangerous. \n \n One of the many bizarre press conferences on that tour, captured in DA Pennebaker's magnificent documentary, Don't Look Back, is exquisitely reprised by Cate Blanchett, who gives a stunning performance as Dylan in Todd Haynes' 2007 movie, I'm Not There. \n \n Reporter: \"How many people who major in the same musical vineyard in which you toil are protest singers? That is, people who use their music to protest the social state in which we live today?\" \n \n Dylan: \"How many?\" \n \n Reporter: \"Yes. How many?\" \n \n Dylan: \"I think there are about 136.\" \n \n Reporter: \"About 136, or exactly 136?\" \n \n Dylan: \"It's either 136 or 142.\" \n \n You know something?\" Bruce Langhorne had told me. \"I have always believed that fame is a curse. I never envied one of the famous people I've known.\" \"None of them?\" \"Not one.\" \n \n In July 1966, Bob Dylan came off his motorcycle near his family home at Bearsville, close to Woodstock in upstate New York: an accident (three months almost to the day after Fari\u00f1a's) thought to have been exaggerated by the singer in order to escape the pressures of touring. Ever since then, he has struggled to keep his distance from his huge and obsessed fanbase. His elusiveness has, naturally enough, only increased their inquisitiveness. \n \n Dylan moved out of Bearsville after the 1969 Woodstock festival, complaining that his house was besieged by \"druggies\". He moved to Greenwich Village, where he bought a property uncomfortably close to the HQ of his Moriarty, AJ Weberman. Weberman was the embodiment of everything Bob Dylan was striving to avoid: an invasive fan who saw him as an oracle, and was maniacally dedicated to propelling Dylan back into the spotlight. \n \n Weberman, self-proclaimed inventor of the science of \"garbology\", rooted through Dylan's bins in the early Seventies. \n \n For reasons that are still hard to explain, Dylan let himself be taped speaking on the phone to Weberman in January 1971. The bizarre recording is still commercially available. AJ harangues him for his sluggishness in opposing the Vietnam War. One exchange goes as follows... \n \n Dylan: \"I think I'm going to write a song about you.\" \n \n Weberman: \"I could use the publicity. What's it called?\" \n \n Dylan: \"Pig.\" \n \n AJ Weberman now lives in a comfortable apartment in Manhattan, purchased with proceeds whose source he has never sought to conceal. I meet him for tea at the Yippie Museum and Caf\u00e9 in Bleecker Street. For a while we are joined by his fellow counterculture activist, Dana Beal. A few months later, I turn on the news to see that Dana has been apprehended on Highway 6, Ashland, Nebraska, in a van found to contain 186lb of marijuana. AJ will post on Facebook that this cargo (which weighs far more than he does) was for \"Dana's personal use\". \n \n Talking to AJ Weberman, you quickly sense how wrong it is to accuse Dylan of being paranoid about securing his privacy. Many of his fans can be over-defensive of him: the screenwriter Mark Jacobson, reviewing Dylan's interminable 1978 movie Renaldo And Clara, disliked the movie to the point that he actually wished the singer dead in print: a remark which, Jacobson tells me, provoked messages causing him to fear for his safety. \n \n Weberman, you sense, is not so much a man on the road to madness, as someone who has arrived there, bought a property and is renting out rooms. Many of Dylan's songs are, in AJ's opinion, coded attacks on him. Others, as he claims in his incredibly libellous book RightWing Bob, are about Dylan's supposed experience in relation to heroin, HIV and racism. \n \n This is Al on \"Blowin' In The Wind\": \"'How many roads?' That's a reference to Cecil Rhodes [the English-born founder of Rhodesia]. Dylan means how long before you realise blacks are nothing but manservants. Why a white dove? This song asks, 'How long before apartheid is going to work in America?' \n \n The answer is 'blowin' in the wind'. That means, hang the niggers from the trees.\" \n \n The day Dylan beat him up, Weberman says it felt like a privilege. \"I'd been going though his trash. He knocked me down. I was glad to see him, even though he was banging my head against the sidewalk. Afterwards these bums come over and say, 'Did he get much money?' I say, 'Money'? That was Bob Dylan.'\" \n \n At one point I mention a relatively obscure Dylan composition called \"Sign Language\". \"Now that,\" I suggest, \"really is a bad song.\" \n \n Weberman looks appalled. \"Are you crazy? Bob has never written a bad song. Bob Dylan,\" he adds, with some warmth, \"is a genius.\" \n \n REX / Shutterstock \n \n Why would so secretive a man keep touring, and expose himself to huge audiences every year? It's not the money, colleagues say. \n \n Dylan is believed to own around a dozen properties, all over the world. \n \n The singer himself has given various explanations, ranging from the clich\u00e9d (\"It's in my blood\") to the bizarre. In 2005 he appeared on American current-affairs show 60 Minutes with Ed Bradley, who put the question to him. \"It goes back to the destiny thing,\" Dylan replied. \"I made a bargain with it, you know, a long time ago. And I'm holding up my end.\" \"What was your bargain?\" \"To get where I am now.\" \"And who did you made the bargain with?\" \"You know, with the chief commander.\" \"On this earth?\" \"On this earth and in a world we can't see.\" \n \n I spoke to Bradley a few months after he did the interview, and he agreed that, though Dylan smiles occasionally during this encounter, his body language is not that of a man who is joking. \n \n Just taking a flier on this for a moment, and assuming that he has not entered into a pact with Satan, perhaps one advantage to touring is that, these days, the singer appears able to keep his distance just as well when on the road as off it. \n \n This was not always the case. The last writer to get close to Bob Dylan on an everyday basis was Larry \"Ratso\" Sloman, who began by accompanying him as a journalist on the 1975 Rolling Thunder Revue tour and wound up co-producing his video for \"Jokerman\". \n \n Amid the notorious debauchery of the Rolling Thunder Revue, Ratso managed the not inconsiderable feat of standing out as sleazy; he was given his nickname (inspired by Dustin Hoffman's low-life character in 1969's Midnight Cowboy) by Joan Baez. \"I wouldn't do it again,\" Sloman told me. \"I was young and I was broke.\" \n \n Ratso bonded with Dylan after losing his temper in a hotel lobby in Vermont. \"I don't need this humiliation and abuse,\" he complained. \"I can write about other things. I'm going home.\" \"What is it that you need, Ratso?\" Dylan asked. \"Be specific.\" \"I need access.\" \"You need Ex-Lax?\" \n \n There is one thing that never deserted him, I suggest to singer Kinky Friedman, who briefly travelled with the Rolling Thunder Revue, and that is his sense of humour. \n \n Friedman recalls taking a flight when there were no first-class seats left. \"There were only a few seats left in coach and Bob found himself seated next to a young female fan. 'I can't believe I'm sitting next to Bob Dylan!' she screamed. \n \n 'Pinch yourself,' said Bob.\" \n \n There are, according to one well-placed source, widespread misunderstandings about the way Bob Dylan works and lives. First is the notion that he lives permanently on the road. This springs from the title of his Never Ending Tour, a phrase originally invented by a journalist. \"On average,\" a colleague said, \"he spends around a hundred nights on the road.\" This is by no means unique or - in an age where profit is increasingly driven by ticket sales - even exceptional. \"The other thing that might surprise people is that his life when he's travelling is remarkably normal. He stays in relatively modest hotels. When he goes out, though he has security, he isn't accompanied by dozens of bodyguards.\" \"Observation of people and places,\" one musician told me, \"has always been very important to him - whether that means wandering around New York at night, or visiting a new town. Bob Dylan is extremely curious. The great thing about being on the road is that it allows him to be anonymous without being isolated. And he really likes to be anonymous.\" \n \n This view would seem to be confirmed by a few recent incidents involving the singer. \"What kind of alchemy,\" Dylan asks, in Chronicles, \"could create a perfume that would make a reaction to a person lukewarm, indifferent and apathetic?\" If such a scent could be made, he adds, he'd like some. \n \n It seems that the singer must have got his hands on a bottle and applied it with gusto one day in July 2009, when he took a stroll away from his tour buses, which were parked outside a hotel in Long Branch, New Jersey. When he wandered into the garden of a property displaying a For Sale sign, the occupants called 911 complaining that an \"eccentric-looking old man\" was on their land, his hood raised against the heavy rain. \"I asked him what his name was,\" said Officer Kristie Buble, 24, \"and he said, 'Bob Dylan.' Now I'd seen a couple of photographs of Bob Dylan from years ago, and he didn't look like Bob Dylan to me at all. He was wearing black sweatpants tucked into black rain boots, and two raincoats with the hood pulled down over his head. \n \n So I said, 'OK, Bob, what are you doing in Long Branch?' He said he was touring with Willie Nelson and John Mellencamp.\" \n \n The officer took him back to the bus, where she was shown his passport. \"I wasn't sure,\" she explained, \"if he'd come from one of the hospitals.\" Bob Dylan, she added, was courteous throughout. \n \n Creativity, Dylan says in Chronicles, \"has to do with experience, observation and imagination. If any one of those elements is missing, it doesn't work.\" The silent contemplation of other lives seems to have been an important part of his working process from the start. One of the most uncomfortable filmed interviews he ever gave - a title not easily gained - was in Toronto, with documentary director Christopher Skyes, in the star's trailer on the set of the 1987 film Hearts Of Fire. (Reg Presley of the Troggs, who appeared as a guitar-playing extra, told me he was approached on set by Dylan. \"He said, 'How long have you been carrying that instrument around?' So I said, 'All bloody afternoon, mate.'\") \n \n Richard Marquand, director of Hearts Of Fire, told Sykes, who was filming an Omnibus special, that the singer was \"a pussycat\" and \"a joy\" to work with. The director died of a heart attack before the film was released. \n \n Dylan, who is no stranger to using silence to intimidate, sketched Sykes during their brief session. This allowed the singer to be even less voluble than normal, and put the director in the unenviable position of having to supply the bulk of the conversation. \"I read this article,\" Sykes says. \"It was about Schubert.\" \"Yeah?\" says Dylan, with a mutinous glare. \"The guy was saying that, listening to these Schubert songs, you had to think that he was connected to some kind of pipe, down which all this stuff came.\" \n \n PA Photos \n \n A pause. \"A pipe?\" Dylan repeats, scenting blood. \"Yeah,\" Sykes replies. \"Some sort of a pipe, or conduit. He couldn't kinda grasp how this guy Schubert was writing these things. Where do your songs come from?\" \"I can't tell you that 'cause I'm not God.\" \"I think,\" Sykes says, \"I'm going to have to look at my list of questions.\" \"Oh, yeah,\" says Dylan, who has taken it. \"Here's your list.\" \n \n Just as you think the session is going to grind to a humiliating end, Dylan volunteers one of the very few Zimmermanesque reflections ever captured on film. \"Fame,\" Dylan says, \"it's like... When you look through a window, say you pass a little pub, or an inn. You look through the window and you see people talking and carrying on. You,\" he continues, avoiding the intimacy of the first person pronoun, \"can watch outside the window and see them all being very real with each other. But when you walk into the room, it's over. I,\" he continues, repossessed by the spirit of Dylan, \"don't pay any attention to it.\" \n \n On May Day, 2009, Dylan showed up at Mendips, the childhood home of Beatle John Lennon, now a museum (his visit was mentioned in Alexei Sayle's 2010 BBC Radio Four documentary, The Lennon Visitors). \n \n He booked under a pseudonym, travelling, as any visitor is required to, on a shuttle bus that he boarded at Speke Hall. His fellow passengers were three ladies from North Wales. Since he had his hood up on the bus, he went unrecognised, until he met the previous group of visitors coming the other way down the drive. \"He was genuinely interested in the house,\" curator Colin Hall told me. \"He spent most time in rooms where songs might have been written or rehearsed.\" Dylan, he added, was particularly taken by the books in Lennon's bedroom: Alice In Wonderland, which he knew, and Richmal Crompton's Just William, which he didn't. \"The whole experience,\" says Hall, a former teacher, \"felt surreal. It was like meeting Shakespeare.\" \n \n Speaking in the early Eighties, Bob Dylan said: \"I don't think I'm going to be understood until a hundred years from now. When I'm dead, maybe people will realise that, and then figure it out.\" \n \n Even now, it's certain that his reputation as an American legend in the tradition of Mark Twain and Walt Whitman is assured. But is he a poet in the traditional sense? While it's true that Allen Ginsberg or TS Eliot would be anything but ashamed of a line like \"the ghost of electricity howls in the bones of her face\", from \"Visions Of Johanna\", they would most likely not have chosen to rhyme \"kelp\" with \"help\", as he does in his captivating eulogy to his first wife, \"Sara\". The truth is that, however much ink has been spilt on this subject (and, for what it's worth, I write this as a former pupil of the late Stephen Wall, close collaborator of Dylan's chief academic advocate, Christopher Ricks, professor of humanities at Boston University) it doesn't matter. \n \n Dylan is, was and always will be rock'n'roll; the key to how he can get away with a line that looks ghastly on the page is simply the mesmeric power of his voice. \n \n But how about the widely held belief that Dylan's output experienced a hiatus for - depending on your view - two decades or more, from the late Seventies onwards? \"Anyone who wants to ignore particular periods of Bob Dylan's work is entitled to what I would consider their rather ignorant opinion,\" Elvis Costello replied, via e-mail. \"To do so would be to dismiss 'Every Grain Of Sand' and 'Ring Them Bells', two of Dylan's most beautiful songs, and numerous others, such as 'Brownsville Girl' and 'Blind Willie McTell'. Not to mention the performances that came from returning to the folk canon for World Gone Wrong [1993]. Much of the writing of power and worth since that time was predicted by that record.\" \n \n With somebody of Dylan's stature, Costello goes on to suggest, it is also possible for a great song to slip past you. \"If I had to cite just one claim to Bob Dylan's strength as an artist in recent years,\" he wrote, \"it would be 'Cross The Green Mountain',\" a recording made for an unheralded movie about the American Civil War called Gods And Generals, released in 2003. (The song appears on The Bootleg Series Volume 8: Tell Tale Signs.) \"At seven minutes, the composition is on a scale few writers could sustain. Images mount up in a monstrous dream of war; victims are seen as decent men even as they fall. Dylan's singing is subtle and nuanced throughout: sometimes grave, other times cruel and at last shattering, when a death notice is received from the front. It is the closing line: 'We loved each other more than we dared to tell' that is most tenderly sung, and the one that catches the tragedy of a divided Union. Maybe,\" Costello continues, \"this is why a wonderful song such as this may outlast the hall of mirrors and misapprehensions about its writer, as if a person should ever be a riddle to be solved.\" \"Bob Dylan,\" somebody once said, \"has so many sides that he's round.\" It's perhaps inevitable that, as you work through archive footage and listen to other people's recollections, his less sympathetic attributes come to the fore. As a single force in his life, envy has been as powerful as any. But in the course of researching this article, I spoke to two people who consider Bob Dylan to have saved their lives, through the help he gave them to escape narcotic addiction: one a musician dependent on heroin in the early Nineties, the other, singer Cerys Matthews. \"One thing people don't realise,\" says actress and musician Ronee Blakley, \"is that Bob is extremely vulnerable. Once we were staying in a smallish hotel in Massachusetts. Bob and I were alone in a large reception room, waiting for people to greet him. He looked at me and said, 'Ronee - help!' I said, 'Help? Help what?' \n \n Then I realised: he was terrified of the onslaught of strangers.\" \n \n The punishing nature of touring, Ronee goes on, \"is rarely acknowledged. Not just the grind of travel, but the holding of the guitar; over the years, it wears down your back and your neck. He switches to piano for most of the show. You could almost say he has sacrificed himself for his art.\" \n \n Punished or not, Bob shows no sign of letting up. In April there is an Australian tour, and work has begun on a follow-up to No Direction Home, this time dealing with the Rolling Thunder Revue tour. He's rumoured to be working on a movie soundtrack. \n \n Dylan is also committed to deliver two more volumes of Chronicles and four other books. In his spare time, he constructs metal sculptures using an arc welder. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Dylan recently noted that Picasso \"went on till he was 90\". He has not gone on record as stating in what other artistic company he'd like his name to be remembered. But in 1985, dropping his guard in the company of the English journalist and biographer Mick Brown, this most reluctant of interviewees did consent to give a list of the people he himself would like to question for the record. \"Hank Williams,\" Dylan said, \"Apollinaire, Joseph of Arimathea, Marilyn Monroe, John F Kennedy, Mohammed and the Apostle Paul. I'd like to interview people who died leaving an unresolved mess behind. And who left people for ages, to do nothing but speculate.\" \n \n Originally published in the May 2011 issue of British GQ. \n \n Like this? Now read: \n \n The Bob Dylan Nobel lecture: the full transcript and best analysis ||||| Famous, Famous-ish, and Not-at-All Famous Non-American Writers Who Are Not Going to Win \n \n Haruki Murakami (Japanese novelist and jogger; 4/1 odds) \n \n \n \n John Banville (Irish novelist; 20/1 odds) \n \n \n \n Milan Kundera (Czech novelist and playwright; 50/1 odds) \n \n \n \n William Trevor (Irish novelist, short story writer, and playwright; 66/1 odds) \n \n Rohinton Mistry (Indo-Canadian novelist and short story writer; 66/1 odds) \n \n Margaret Atwood (Canadian novelist, poet, and essayist; 66/1 odds) \n \n Paul Muldoon (Irish poet; 66/1 odds) \n \n Salman Rushdie (Indo-British novelist, short story writer, and Facebook user; 66/1 odds) \n \n \n \n Tom Stoppard (English playwright and screenwriter; 66/1 odds) \n \n Colm Toibin (Irish novelist, short story writer, and essayist; 66/1 odds) \n \n Julian Barnes (English novelist and essayist; 66/1 odds) \n \n Don Paterson (Scottish poet; 100/1 odds) \n \n A. S. Byatt (English novelist; 100/1 odds) \n \n \n \n James Kelman (Scottish novelist, short story writer, playwright, and essayist; 100/1 odds) \n \n \n \n Hilary Mantel (English novelist and short story writer; 100/1 odds) \n \n \n \n Mostly these are famous writers who people have bet on because they\u2019re famous. Some have strong claims to being Nobel-ish, but there\u2019s always a \u201cbut.\u201d Trevor is interesting, but he\u2019s too similar to Alice Munro, who won in 2013. Stoppard would be great, but he wrote Shakespeare in Love. Atwood would be cool, but there\u2019s Munro again, which means a Canadian isn\u2019t going to win for a long, long time. Kundera seems like a Nobel contender in a lot of ways, but he isn\u2019t even the best Czech writer of his generation (that\u2019d be Ivan Klima) and he hasn\u2019t done good work in a long, long time. Don Paterson clearly bet on himself to win, which is something I would advise marginal English language writers to do. And then there\u2019s Murakami, who always leads the betting and has a credible claim to being our Dickens\u2014an internationally popular, accessible, and often brilliant writer. But Murakami is not going to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. \n \n \n \n One other interesting thing to note: Last year, the popular British novelists in contention, aka Chris Hitchens\u2019s Former Designated Drivers, were Salman Rushdie and Ian McEwan; this year, Julian Barnes seems to have wrestled the keys away from McEwan, or perhaps McEwan\u2019s Look Who\u2019s Talking novelization was seen as being not Nobel material. \n \n Sorry, but These Americans Are Not Going to Win \n \n Philip Roth (American novelist; 7/1 odds) \n \n Bob Dylan (American songwriter and radio host; 50/1 odds) \n \n Richard Ford (American novelist and short story writer; 66/1 odds) \n \n Cormac McCathy (American novelist and screenwriter; 66/1 odds) \n \n \n \n Joan Didion (American novelist and essayist; 66/1 odds) \n \n \n \n Ursula Le Guin (American novelist and wizard; 66/1 odds) \n \n We\u2019re due! We really are. An American hasn\u2019t won the Nobel since Toni Morrison won in freaking 1993. But 2016 is not America\u2019s year. For one thing, any American who won would probably have to say something about the Age of Trump or whatever in their Nobel lecture. And don\u2019t get me wrong: The Nobel Committee would love nothing more than to send a passive-aggressive signal to America by awarding the prize to someone who stands for everything Donald Trump opposes. But none of these elder statesmen and -women really fits that bill. That none of these Americans can really claim the mantle of The One True Great American Novelist makes it even harder. \n \n Many of these writers are also interested in navel-gazing Great American Male questions, and the Nobel has moved on since it gave the prize to Hemingway. Roth would be the favorite, but retirement should disqualify him. The lede of this Richard Ford review of Bruce Springsteen\u2019s memoir disqualifies him, but the Nobel Committee wouldn\u2019t give him the prize anyway, for fear of being cussed out. Cormac McCarthy won\u2019t win because Darkness implacable would beat down on the man as he spat violently onto the dirt. LeGuin is too popular and too genre, even though that would rule. And a nonfiction writer won last year, making a Didion victory unlikely. Bob Dylan 100 percent is not going to win. Stop saying Bob Dylan should win the Nobel Prize. \n \n But Hey, Maybe These American Writers Will Win (Even Though They Won\u2019t) \n \n Marilynne Robinson (American novelist and essayist; 50/1 odds) \n \n Thomas Pynchon (American novelist and weirdo; 50/1 odds) \n \n Lydia Davis (American short story writer; 50/1 odds) \n \n Don DeLillo (American novelist; 66/1 odds) \n \n John Ashbery (American poet; 100/1 odds) \n \n Charles Portis (American novelist; no Ladbrokes odds) \n \n I mean, we\u2019re due, right? We\u2019re due! It\u2019s been 23 years! Give us the prize or we\u2019ll elect Donald Trump! There are a lot of reasons to believe that none of these writers will win. Robinson\u2019s writing is too fixated on Grace and the peculiarities of American theologies. Lydia Davis has never written a story longer than two sentences. Don DeLillo may as well be retired. Pynchon is too goofy. (That said, seeing what Pynchon would do with the acceptance speech would be amazing and Pynchon really isn\u2019t too goofy and absolutely deserves to win.) Of these writers, only Ashbery can really claim to be the godfather of an entire class of American literature, though something tells me that if the Nobel goes to a poet, it won\u2019t be him. I recently told a colleague that I thought Portis should win and they straight up laughed in my face. (Portis is our Mark Twain.) \n \n Joyce Carol Oates \n \n Joyce Carol Oates (14/1 odds) \n \n I\u2019m of two minds here. Giving Joyce Carol Oates the Nobel would be amazing. The response to it would be amazing, her tweets about it would be amazing. Literary awards are usually dull and often pointless, but Oates winning would set fire to everything we thought we knew about the Nobel Prize. Would we now have to look at, say, William Faulkner\u2019s win differently? Yes, we would. But also, giving Joyce Carol Oates the Nobel would be bad, even if they made a dispensation that said, \u201cThis award does not apply to her tweets, which are bad.\u201d In any case, if you are the person who bets on Joyce Carol Oates every year so she is always near the top of the Ladbrokes Nobel Prize list, my email address is ashephard@tnr.com. \n \n Maybe, Just Maybe, This Year... Or Next Year.... Or, More Accurately, in Five Years \n \n Ismail Kadare (Albanian novelist and poet; 16/1 odds) \n \n \n \n Javier Mar\u00edas (Spanish novelist, short story writer, essayist, and translator; 16/1 odds) \n \n \n \n L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Krasznahorkai (Hungarian novelist and screenwriter; 20/1 odds) \n \n Cesar Aira (Argentine novelist, short story writer, and essayist; 20/1 odds) \n \n \n \n Peter Handke (Austrian novelist and playwright; 25/1 odds) \n \n \n \n P\u00e9ter N\u00e1das (Hungarian novelist, playwright, and essayist; 25/1 odds) \n \n \n \n Amos Oz (Israeli novelist; 25/1 odds) \n \n \n \n Adam Zagajewski (Polish poet and essayist; 33/1 odds) \n \n \n \n Enrique Vila-Matas (Spanish novelist; 66/1 odds) \n \n A lot of men! Specifically, a lot of very serious men who are widely read by very serious men. I went to a Krasznahorkai reading a few years ago and it was what I imagine attending a Rush concert would\u2019ve been like in 1980\u2014upper-middle class single white men between the ages of 18 and 34 as far as the eye could see. These are all deserving candidates, but this is probably not their year, and it may never be. In some cases, it\u2019s that they are on the young side\u2014most are in their 60s or early 70s, practically spring chickens as far the Nobel is concerned. Furthermore, there\u2019s evidence to suggest that an international reputation (i.e. being popular or popular-ish in America) works against authors vying for the Nobel. \n \n Recent history may work against them, too\u2014a European novelist, Patrick Modiano, won in 2014, which is a significant barrier to entry. Albanian novelist and person who maybe deserves the Nobel the most in this group Ismail Kadare faces an additional barrier in that he often writes about the evils of 20th century communism and totalitarianism, a fixation that overlaps significantly with recent winners Alexievich and Modiano and Herta Mueller. But I could see at least two of these writers (my bets: Krasznahorkai and Marias) winning in the next decade. \n \n \n \n Can You Imagine How Annoying Karl Ove Kanusgaard Would Be if He Won? \n \n Karl Ove Knausgaard (Norwegian cigarette smoker; 66/1 odds) \n \n Pretty annoying! \n \n Could One of These Australians Win? \n \n Les Murray (Australian poet and critic; 50/1 odds) \n \n \n \n Gerald Murnane (Australian novelist; 50/1 odds) \n \n David Malouf (Australian novelist; 66/1 odds) \n \n \n \n Peter Carey (Australian novelist; 66/1 odds) \n \n An Australian hasn\u2019t won the Nobel Prize since 1973 (Patrick White), so the continent of Australia is overdue. \n \n Obligatory Elena Ferrante Category \n \n Elena Ferrante (Italian novelist and think piece subject; no Ladbrokes odds) \n \n Sure, why not? \n \n Who the Hell Is That and How Did They Just Win the Nobel Prize for Literature? \n \n Ant\u00f3nio Lobo Antunes (Portugese novelist; 20/1 odds) \n \n Abraham B. Yehoshua (Israeli novelist; 25/1 odds) \n \n Doris Kareva (Estonian poet; 33/1 odds) \n \n Mircea Cartarescu (Romanian novelist, poet and essayist; 33/1 odds) \n \n \n \n Juan Mars\u00e9 (Catalan novelist, journalist, and screenwriter; 33/1 odds) \n \n Kjell Askildsen (Norwegian short story writer; 33/1 odds) \n \n Claudio Magris (Italian novelist and nonfiction writer; 33/1 odds) \n \n \n \n Nawal El Saadawi (Egyptian novelist and nonfiction writer; 50/1 odds) \n \n Cees Nooteboom (Dutch novelist and poet; 50/1 odds) \n \n \n \n Leonard Nolens (Belgian poet and memoirist; 50/1 odds) \n \n \n \n Jaan Kaplinski (Estonian poet and philosopher; 50/1 odds) \n \n Jussi Adler-Olsen (Danish novelist; 50/1 odds) \n \n Olga Tokarczuk (Polish novelist; 50/1 odds) \n \n Yevgeniy Yevtushenko (Russian poet; 50/1 odds) \n \n Karel Schoeman (South African novelist and translator; 66/1 odds) \n \n Yan Lianke (Chinese novelist and short story writer;66/1 odds) \n \n \n \n Bei Dao (Chinese poet; 66/1 odds) \n \n Nuruddin Farah (Somali novelist; 66/1 odds) \n \n Dacia Maraini (Italian novelist, playwright, and essayist; 66/1 odds) \n \n \n \n Juan Goytisolo (Spanish novelist, poet, and essayist; 66/1 odds) \n \n \n \n Mia Couto (Mozambican novelist and short story writer; 66/1) odds \n \n \n \n Eduardo Mendoza-Garriga (Spanish novelist; 66/1 odds) \n \n F. Sionil Jos\u00e9 (Filipino novelist and short story writer; 100/1 odds) \n \n Antonio Mu\u00f1oz Molina (Spanish novelist; no Ladbrokes odds) \n \n Mohammed Dowlatabadi (Iranian novelist; no Ladbrokes odds) \n \n Sergio Pitol (Mexican novelist, short story writer, and essayist; no Ladbrokes odds) \n \n Dubravka Ugresic (Croatian novelist, short story writer, and essayist; no Ladbrokes odds) \n \n Dag Solstad (Norwegian novelist, short story writer, and playwright; no Ladbrokes odds) \n \n Someone You\u2019ve Never Heard of From a Country You\u2019ve Never Visited (2/1 Ladbrokes odds) \n \n With the last three Nobel Prizes having gone to a Canadian international bestselling author who writes in the coveted \u201cpeople looking at lakes\u201d category (Alice Munro), a French guy who writes about remembering stuff that he thought he forgot but actually didn\u2019t (Patrick Modiano), and a Belarusian woman who sort of makes stuff up and calls it oral history (Svetlana Alexievich), this year\u2019s winner is anyone\u2019s guess. But the underdog always has a distinct advantage. The Nobel Prize often goes to writers who have little or no publishing history in the United States, and that includes a whole heck of a lot of the people included above. And even those who have been published in the U.S. are not widely read. \n \n But there are a lot of stellar names in this category. Antunes and Yehoshua are not as widely read in the U.S. as they should be, and both are probably the greatest living writers in their respective countries. Solstad is the Scandanivan most likely to snatch the Nobel from Jon Fosse\u2019s hands. The Romanian writer Mircea Cartarescu will win the award, but probably not until sometime in the mid-2020s. Still, many of these contenders are too similar to recent winners. If an unknown wins the Nobel, it is more likely than not that they won\u2019t come from this list.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 \"Bob Dylan\" was one of the top Twitter trends Thursday thanks to the troubadour taking home the Nobel Prize for Literature. But while most of social media is beaming at his newest honor, Scottish author Irvine Welsh, who wrote the novel Trainspotting, isn't terribly pleased, the AP reports. Welsh spent much of Thursday morning on Twitter retweeting posts that trashed Dylan's win, and tweeting: \"I'm a Dylan fan, but this is an ill conceived nostalgia award wrenched from the rancid prostates of senile, gibbering hippies.\" His main beef appears to be the separation of a metaphorical church and state\u2014in this case, songs and lit\u2014that he thinks should exist, adding, \"If you're a 'music' fan, look it up in the dictionary.

Reading books is hard.\" Jay Perini gives a thumbs-up at CNN, noting how Dylan's songs \"speak to our deepest concerns\" and how he's \"filled our heads with language that both interprets and transforms the realities we confront.\" At the Guardian, Richard Williams looks at whether music and literature can actually be successfully linked (in terms of a Nobel Prize), and he breaks it down line by line to show the \"profound resonance\" of Dylan's lyrics. Robert Chalmers makes the slightly uncomfortable observation for GQ that \"everything would be so much more simple if he were dead,\" as Dylan would have ascended to legendary status. But Chalmers still jumps on the pro-Dylan bandwagon, noting, \"His voice may, like the Havana cigars and bourbon to which it is often lazily compared, be an acquired taste, but Dylan is responsible, as much as Billie Holiday, for reinventing the whole style of popular singing.\" Meanwhile, a naysayer singing the Black \"Eating Crow\" Blues: Alex Shephard, who wrote last week for the New Republic that \"Bob Dylan 100 percent is not going to win.

It changed my life | Jason Hernandez Read more \n \n The unusual protest has been called by inmates angry at being used as unpaid clean-up crews for storm debris in sweltering temperatures last September, after Hurricane Irma struck the state. \n \n But organisers cite a number of other longstanding grievances for the planned month-long action, in which prisoners will refuse to take part in work assignments and forego purchasing \u201coverpriced\u201d luxury items such as snacks and toiletries, in an attempt to hit the state\u2019s department of corrections in the pocket. \n \n \u201cOur goal is to make the governor realise that it will cost the state of Florida millions of dollars daily to contract outside companies to come and cook, clean and handle the maintenance,\u201d the unnamed prisoners said in a statement posted on the website of the inmates\u2019 advocacy group Fight Toxic Prisons. \n \n \u201cThis will cause a total breakdown. We must use everything we have to show that we mean business.\u201d \n \n Florida has the nation\u2019s third-largest prison system with 97,000 inmates, according to state figures. It is also one of the most troubled and violent such systems, with allegations of abuse of inmates rife. \n \n In 2017, officers were cleared of blame for the death of a mentally ill patient they left in a scalding shower for two hours as punishment. In-depth investigations by the Miami Herald uncovered large numbers of rapes, beatings and cover-ups in the state\u2019s non-air-conditioned jails. \n \n The prisoners have dubbed their protest Operation Push, after civil rights leader Jesse Jackson\u2019s 1970s campaign to improve economic conditions for African Americans. Almost a third of Florida inmates are black, compared with fewer than 17% in the general population. \n \n They force them to work at gunpoint and they pay them nothing. There\u2019s a word for that, it\u2019s called slavery Paul Wright, Human Rights Defense Center \n \n One key demand is a reasonable wage for the labour inmates provide. \n \n \u201cThey force them to work at gunpoint and they pay them nothing,\u201d said Paul Wright, executive director of the Florida-based Human Rights Defense Cener. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s a word for that, it\u2019s called slavery. \n \n \u201cFlorida is one of the few states in the country that doesn\u2019t pretend to pay even a nominal wage. Some states might say they pay 10 cents a day, or 15 cents an hour, or whatever, but here they make it pretty clear they don\u2019t pay prisoners anything, they\u2019re not going to, and prisoners are totally enslaved at every level. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s no legal way for Florida\u2019s prisoners to earn money in the prison system.\u201d \n \n The inmates also want the return of parole as an incentive for those with long-term sentences and an end to what they see as price gouging on food and other necessities. \n \n \u201cOne case of soup on the street cost $4, it costs us $17 on the inside,\u201d the prisoners said in their statement. \u201cThis is highway robbery without a gun. It\u2019s not just us that they\u2019re taking from. It\u2019s our families who struggle to make ends meet and send us money, they are the real victims.\u201d \n \n Advocacy groups and friends and families of inmates have organised solidarity rallies outside several prisons and department of corrections offices on Monday, including in Miami and Tallahassee. \n \n According to the Tallahassee Democrat, officials sent an email to employees at department headquarters urging them to lock doors and stay inside during the protests. \n \n Tensions are running high in the Florida prison system. Last August, all facilities were placed on a three-day lockdown after unspecific threats of rioting. \n \n In an emailed statement to the Guardian and other media outlets, department of corrections communications director Michelle Glady did not address detailed questions about the planned response to Monday\u2019s planned protests. \n \n \u201cThe department will continue to ensure the safe operation of our correctional facilities,\u201d she said. ||||| Florida prisoners are calling for a general strike to start this week \u2014 marking the third mass action over the course of a year in protest of inhumane conditions in the state\u2019s detention facilities. Detainees in at least eight prisons have declared their intention to stop all work on Monday \u2014 Martin Luther King Jr. Day \u2014 to demand an end to unpaid labor and price gouging in prison commissaries, as well as the restoration of parole, among other requests. \n \n Coordinated, nonviolent prison protests, as well as spontaneous uprisings amid deteriorating conditions, have escalated in recent years both nationwide and in Florida, which has the third-largest prison system in the country. Prisoners in the state were among the most active during a nationwide strike in September 2016, which was quickly dubbed the \u201clargest prison strike in U.S. history.\u201d At least 10 Florida prisons participated in that action, which was planned to coincide with the 45th anniversary of the Attica prison uprising but started a day early when tensions flared at Holmes Correctional Institution in the Florida Panhandle. Then, in August, in response to prison activists\u2019 calls for another show of dissent, Department of Corrections officials placed the entire state system \u2014 143 facilities and 97,000 people \u2014 on lockdown, an unprecedented move. \n \n Incarcerated organizers of this week\u2019s strike have chosen to remain anonymous to prevent retaliation, but they shared a statement outlining their demands with outside supporters. In an audio message from prison shared with The Intercept, one of the organizers described the action as a \u201cnonviolent protest to get what we deserve from our government.\u201d \n \n \u201cThey use wordplay and deceive the public about what really goes on inside the system, and we want to expose those things,\u201d he said. \n \n Prison officials regularly retaliate against organizers by restricting their visitation rights and contact with other inmates, and sometimes even moving them to different facilities, which makes it harder for reports of protests to reach the public. But despite the challenges, \u201cprisoners are pretty well-organized and coordinated inside the prisons and throughout the prison system,\u201d said Panagioti Tsolkas, an organizer with the prisoners\u2019 rights and environmentalist group Campaign to Fight Toxic Prisons. Tsolkas, who communicates regularly with activists inside, said some of the upcoming strike\u2019s organizers have already been placed in solitary confinement in retaliation for their efforts. \n \n In response to questions about the planned strike, a spokesperson for the Florida Department of Corrections wrote in a statement to The Intercept that \u201cthe department will continue to ensure the safe operation of our correctional institutions.\u201d \n \n \u201cSlave Labor\u201d and Price Gouging \n \n Florida prisoners work both inside the prisons \u2014 doing laundry, cooking, maintaining the facilities, and growing food \u2014 and on outside \u201ccommunity work squads.\u201d According to the corrections department, in 2017 the latter group alone performed 3.15 million hours of work valued at more than $38 million statewide, including cleanup work after Hurricane Irma. \n \n \u201cOur goal is to make the governor realize that it will cost the state of Florida millions of dollars daily to contract outside companies to come and cook, clean, and handle the maintenance,\u201d the prisoners wrote in their statement. \u201cThis will cause a total BREAK DOWN.\u201d \n \n Prisoners are demanding compensation for their work as opposed to \u201cthe current slave arrangement,\u201d they wrote, in which they are paid in time deducted from their sentences. \u201cA lot of times people will work in order to get time deducted, and then the prison guards and officials will find ways to punish someone for what the prisoners are saying are made up reasons that then extend the person\u2019s time,\u201d Jacqueline Azis, an attorney with the Florida chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, told The Intercept. \n \n \u201cWe want to be paid for the work we do, so that somebody doesn\u2019t end up spending 10, 15, 20 years not being paid, and sent home with a bus ticket and a $50 check,\u201d the prisoner speaking in the recording said. \u201cWe want to create an environment where someone can do their time, be rehabilitated, and enter into society with some type of hope.\u201d \n \n \u201cThat would be helpful for society instead of creating a revolving door where you lock people up and just set them up for failure so that they keep coming back.\u201d \n \n Prisoners are also calling for fairer pricing of goods they can purchase in prison \u2014 claiming, for example, that a case of soup that costs $4 on the outside is sold for $17 by prison commissaries (the DOC disputed that claim and provided the following list of canteen prices). \n \n \u201cThis is highway robbery without a gun,\u201d the prisoners wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s not just us that they\u2019re taking from. It\u2019s our families who struggle to make ends meet and send us money \u2014 they are the real victims that the state of Florida is taking advantage of.\u201d \n \n Strike organizers are also calling on Florida to restore parole \u2014 which the state eliminated for non-capital felonies in 1984. \u201cWhen someone is sentenced to life in prison, it means life in prison in Florida,\u201d said Azis. \u201cThere is no chance that good behavior in prison will get someone out earlier.\u201d \n \n The lack of parole has compounded the system\u2019s colossal overcrowding, which in turn has contributed to some of the harshest and most violent prison conditions in the country. \u201cThere are so many unexplained deaths,\u201d Lisa Graybill, deputy legal director for criminal justice reform at the Southern Poverty Law Center, told The Intercept. \u201cThey\u2019re just appalling.\u201d \n \n A prisoner works on the lawn at Dade Correctional Institution, where mentally ill prisoner Darren Rainey died in 2012, in Florida City, Florida, July 10, 2014. Photo:Lynne Sladky/AP \n \n Unexplained Deaths in Custody \n \n Deaths in Florida state prisons \u2014 including homicides and a spate of suicides \u2014 have skyrocketed in recent years, soaring from 191 in 2000 to 356 in 2016. \n \n Among those killed in custody was Darren Rainey, a mentally ill prisoner who was scalded to death at Dade Correctional Institution in 2012 when guards locked him in a hot shower for two hours. The water reached temperatures as high as 180 degrees, according to witnesses, including a nurse on duty that night who said that the heat controls were in a neighboring room controlled by guards. \n \n Following Rainey\u2019s death, a devastating investigation by the Miami Herald detailed more unexplained and brutal deaths, as well as system-wide neglect and abuse and efforts to cover up prison officials\u2019 wrongdoing. Randall Jordan-Aparo, an inmate with disabilities at Franklin Correctional Institution, was killed in 2010 when guards beat him and gassed him with a chemical agent after he begged for medical help for days (prison guards later took to Facebook to mock his death). Another prisoner allegedly hanged herself while her hands were tied. \n \n The corrections department has also been sued over its treatment of prisoners with disabilities and its failure to treat prisoners with hepatitis C, and rights groups have called on the Department of Justice \u2014 twice \u2014 to open a federal civil rights investigation into the state\u2019s prisons. \u201cThese problems are chronic,\u201d Graybill said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t been addressed and they\u2019re not going away.\u201d \n \n Like most other states, Florida went on an \u201cincarceration binge\u201d in the 1990s, Graybill said. But unlike most other states \u2014 some 36 of which have undertaken some kind of criminal justice reform \u2014 the state has consistently refused to reconsider its policies. \n \n \u201cThe solution for Florida is clear,\u201d she said. \u201cIt needs to improve the conditions of confinement in its facilities, and one way it can afford to do that is by ensuring that it is only incarcerating the people who truly need to be incarcerated.\u201d \n \n \u201cThe question becomes, Why has the legislature been so unwilling or unable to do that?\u201d \n \n \u201cThis Is Florida \u2026 We\u2019ll Beat Your Ass!\u201d \n \n In addition to denouncing brutal conditions of confinement, the prisoners are demanding broader criminal justice reform in Florida \u2014 including restored voting rights and a moratorium on executions. \n \n Florida is one of four states in the country \u2014 with Kentucky, Iowa, and Virginia \u2014 that imposes lifetime disenfranchisement for people convicted of felonies. That means 1.5 million state residents can\u2019t vote because of their criminal history. \u201cPeople who have already paid their debt to society are essentially prevented from being active citizens,\u201d said Azis, the ACLU lawyer. \n \n A proposed constitutional amendment could change that \u2014 if it can garner enough support to get on the ballot \u2014 but until that passes, the only potential path to the vote is for each disenfranchised individual to personally appeal to the governor, Rick Scott. Scott grants only 8 percent of those appeals, with little transparency on the decision-making process and a backlog of 10,000 applications awaiting review, the New York Times recently reported. The process leaves restoration of the right to vote dependent on the governor\u2019s personal convictions. In a hearing on the voting rights of a man who had been convicted of manslaughter in a drunken driving incident, for instance, Scott said he would need to think about it \u2014 then noted, with his mic accidentally still on, \u201cThat\u2019s how my uncle died.\u201d \n \n Scott also wields disproportionate power when it comes to the state\u2019s death penalty. After newly elected prosecutor Aramis Ayala \u2014 Florida\u2019s first black state attorney \u2013 said she would not seek the death penalty in her district, which includes Orlando, Scott moved 29 potential capital cases to a different jurisdiction. Ayala appealed, but the state\u2019s Supreme Court ruled in the governor\u2019s favor, forcing her to walk back her ban. Last year, Florida moved to tighten its death penalty laws by requiring a unanimous jury verdict after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the previous sentencing protocol was unconstitutional. The move made dozens of people eligible for re-sentencing, but the state limited retroactive application to those sentenced after 2002 \u2014 leaving approximately 200 on death row with sentences ineligible for review. \n \n Finally, prisoners planning the strike are joining the local community\u2019s protest against a phosphate mine set to surround the Reception and Medical Center near Lake Butler, where new arrivals and inmates with medical conditions are housed. Residents and prisoners fear the health consequences of water contamination and exposure to potential carcinogens linked to phosphate mining. \n \n Kevin \u201cRashid\u201d Johnson arrived at the Reception and Medical Center last spring. \n \n Johnson, a well-known prison activist, jailhouse lawyer, and prolific writer and critic of prison abuse, had already been moved from Virginia to Texas under an interstate agreement that allows for the transfer of prisoners \u2014 ostensibly for public safety reasons, but often as a punitive measure. \n \n That Johnson would be transferred to Florida \u201cis a piece of evidence of how the Florida prison system is viewed even by the prison industry itself,\u201d said Tsolkas, who has been communicating with him ahead of the upcoming strike. \u201cAppalachia wasn\u2019t bad enough. Texas wasn\u2019t bad enough. Well, you\u2019re going to the swamps.\u201d \n \n At the RMC, Johnson wrote in July, a guard told him that he was \u201cnot in Virginia, or wherever else\u201d he might have been previously. \u201cYou will answer us only as \u2018no sir\u2019 and \u2018yessir,\u2019 \u2018no ma\u2019am\u2019 and \u2018yes ma\u2019am.\u2019 You forget this and we\u2019ll kick your fucking teeth out,\u201d the guard said, according to Johnson. \u201cThis is Florida, and we\u2019ll beat your ass! We\u2019ll kill you!\u201d \n \n That didn\u2019t stop Johnson from continuing to expose prison abuse in Florida, or from joining the state prisoners\u2019 organizing efforts, including ahead of Monday\u2019s strike. \n \n \u201cWhat the prisoners are asking for is not only completely reasonable, but should be the bare minimum of how we treat an individual that the state is in charge of caring for,\u201d said Azis. \u201cI would hope that whatever the DOC\u2019s response is, it is an ethical and responsible way of addressing these real concerns.\u201d",

She added, \u201cWe should be blessed to have Robin\u2019s financial status.\u201d \n \n Shortly after Williams\u2019 death was confirmed Monday, online gossip publications jumped to potential money issues of the late actor, something that his publicist said simply do not exist. \n \n \u201cI understand the desire to understand the \u2018Why,'\u201d Buxbaum continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen. The better thing to do is to try to understand severe depression. That isn\u2019t going to be answered, and you can speculate all you want.\u201d \n \n Also read: Robin Williams\u2019 Children Mourn Father, Remember Him As Warm, Gentle Soul \n \n Still last year, Williams told Parade magazine that part of the reason for his return to TV via CBS\u2019 \u201cThe Crazy Ones\u201d was to have a steady gig and pay the bills: \u201cThe idea of having a steady job is appealing. I have two [other] choices: go on the road doing stand-up, or do small, independent movies working almost for scale [minimum union pay].\u201d \n \n \u201cThe movies are good, but a lot of times they don\u2019t even have distribution,\u201d he added. \u201cThere are bills to pay.\u201d \n \n \u201cMy life has downsized, in a good way,\u201d Williams continued. \u201cI\u2019m selling the ranch up in Napa. I just can\u2019t afford it anymore.\u201d \n \n \u201cThe Crazy Ones\u201d was canceled after just one season; Williams earned an estimated $165,000 per episode. \n \n Also read: Robin Williams\u2019 Final Photo, Social Media Moments \n \n Buxbaum says that in that interview her client was expressing his appreciation for stability, and was otherwise joking about a comfortable financial status. \n \n \u201cRobin often said things in jest, and sometimes it just doesn\u2019t translate in print,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were plenty of times over the years that Robin was offered to do TV,\u201d Buxbaum told us. \u201cRobin wanted to do \u2018The Crazy Ones\u2019 because of (show creator) David Kelley and the material. That\u2019s why he took the show \u2026 not because he needed the money.\u201d \n \n Also read: Robin Williams Leaves Behind Four Movies Including \u2018Night at the Museum 3\u2019 \n \n Another topic that he often cracked wise about were his divorces, Buxbaum said. \n \n When asked by Parade if he lost all of his money in the two splits, Williams said: \u201cWell, not all. Lost enough. Divorce is expensive. I used to joke they were going to call it \u2018all the money,\u2019 but they changed it to \u2018alimony.\u2019 It\u2019s ripping your heart out through your wallet. Are things good with my exes? Yes. But do I need that lifestyle? No.\u201d \n \n Also read: Robin Williams Found in Bedroom \u2018With a Belt Secured Around His Neck,\u2019 Coroner Says \n \n On reported trust funds and the financial status the late comic and actor leaves behind, she concluded, \u201cWe will not comment on specifics other than to say Robin\u2019s family is amply taken care of.\u201d \n \n According to Forbes, Williams\u2019 net worth was an estimated $50 million. Public real estate records show that Williams\u2019 Napa Valley mansion, which rests on 653 acres and is named Villa Sorriso, has been on the market since April for $29.9 million. Williams also leaves behind a 6,500-square-fo ot waterfront home in Tiburon, Calif., valued at roughly $6 million. \n \n The two properties have mortgages that totaled $7.25 million as of 2011. Doing some math, that means Williams left behind real estate with equity of around $25 million, subject to a Villa Sorriso sale. \n \n See video: Robin Williams on Battling Depression, Addiction: \u2018I Get Bummed\u2019 \n \n \u201cPresumably there are no probate issues because he had good legal advice and had a fully funded living trust,\u201d legal trust expert Bruce Givner said, adding: \u201cPresumably there will be no interesting legal issues because his trust provided that the assets would be held for his wife and children.\u201d \n \n \u201cWhether there was estate tax planning we probably won\u2019t know because his estate planning documents will never become public,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe only way they will become public is if he died without a will or trust; with only a will and not a living trust; or if there is litigation.\u201d \n \n Givner is no stranger to high profile Hollywood clients, having represented Phil Spector all the way through jail and probating Robert Blake\u2019s estate, among many others. \n \n See video: \u2018Peter Pan Live!\u2019 Star Allison Williams Pays Tribute to Robin Williams During Flying Lesson: \u2018Big Shoes to Fill\u2019 \n \n While Givner doesn\u2019t know Williams\u2019 specific bequeathment situation, he can make a fairly reasonable assumption, he said. \u201cNo one with any type of wealth will have a will as their main dispositive document,\u201d Givner told TheWrap. \n \n Plus, California is the home of the alternative living trust, a substitute for a will, Givner said. And the living trust has many advantages over a will \u2014 the main one being privacy. \n \n While a probated will goes to probate court and is public, a living trust doesn\u2019t, unless there is a dispute. In 98 percent of cases there are no fights and living trusts are never made public. \n \n Also read: Robin Williams, Oscar-Winning Actor, Dead at 63 of Suicide \n \n On Monday, Williams was found dead in his residence \u201cwith a belt secured around his neck, with the other end of the belt wedged between the closed closet door and door frame,\u201d according to the coroner.

The recording session came just weeks before Williams entered rehab. In the movie, Robin voiced the character of a dog. \n \n \"It was a magical experience working with Robin,\" said screenwriter Gavin Scott. \"He bounced into the studio and he was like, 'Yes, let's do this!'\" \n \n In Tuesday's press conference, authorities revealed that Williams' wife Susan spent the night in a different bedroom, which raised the question of whether they usually slept in separate rooms. \n \n NEWS: Latest on the Death of Robin Williams \n \n As Susan didn't see Robin before she left in the morning, Dr. Phil McGraw told us that the family should be wary of blaming themselves. \n \n \"What I hope they don't do is play the 'What if?' game,\" said Dr. Phil. \"Let me tell you something if someone really wants to take their own life they can get it done.\" \n \n Williams died at his Marin County home on Monday due to asphyxia caused by the late actor hanging himself with a belt. \n \n According to Williams' rep, the actor had been battling \"severe depression as of late.\" ||||| But, like any major movie star with such a long career, Williams accumulated his share of bombs along with the hits, including much-maligned critical and commercial duds like \"Fathers' Day\" and \"Bicentennial Man.\" In recent years, he would sometimes joke self-deprecatingly about what he seemed to view as a downturn in his career. On his 2009 stand-up tour, he imagined a conversation with his car's GPS, in which the navigation system was trying to steer him off the Golden Gate Bridge. \"I said, 'Why? Have you seen my movies recently?'\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 In the days before his death, Robin Williams \"would often sleep a majority of the day and night,\" a source tells Radar. He was so depressed, \"he wasn't eating and was just having problems getting out of bed,\" the source continues. \"He would often complain that he was just so tired, even after sleeping 20 hours.\" Friends who will actually allow their names to be used tell the Los Angeles Times similar, though not as dramatic, stories. \"He started to disconnect,\" fellow comedian and longtime friend Rick Overton says. \"He wasn't returning calls as much. He would send texts and things like that, but they would get shorter and shorter.\" He was last photographed in public on Saturday night, with his wife at an art gallery reception near his home, TMZ reports, noting that he looked \"frail\" but seemed happy and was not drinking. He was found dead Monday morning. \"You could just tell something was off,\" says Steven Pearl, another comedian and longtime friend, about the last time he saw Williams last month. \"He seemed detached. It's hard to explain. He didn't seem like his usual self. My fiancee and I were like, 'Is he OK?' I didn't know it would get this dark.\" He also took a hit with the cancellation of his TV show, The Crazy Ones, after just one season, Overton says. And since Williams had spoken last year about needing to take on that gig in the first place thanks to all the money coughed up in his two divorces, some speculated financial problems contributed to his suicide, leading his publicist to explain to The Wrap that the actor \"had no financial problems. ... Robin often said things in jest, and sometimes it just doesn't translate in print.\" He took the job \"because of (show creator) David Kelley and the material ... not because he needed the money,\" she says. The current speculation, ETOnline notes, is whether Williams and his wife frequently slept in separate rooms, as they did on the last night of Williams' life.",

En route to the hospital, they were stopped at a Customs and Border Patrol checkpoint. Immigration agents then proceeded to follow the two to the hospital and remained there throughout the night. \n \n Once she was discharged, Rosa Maria, who suffers from cerebral palsy, was escorted via ambulance to the Bexar County Juvenile Detention Center in San Antonio, Texas, by officers with Customs and Border Protection. \n \n In a statement, the agency said it \"is committed to enforcing the immigration laws of this nation,\" which include detaining undocumented immigrants. \n \n \"Due to the juvenile\u2019s medical condition, Border Patrol agents escorted her and her cousin to a Corpus Christi hospital where she could receive appropriate medical care,\" the statement continued. \n \n \"Per the immigration laws of the United States, once medically cleared she will be processed accordingly,\" the statement concluded. \n \n That process was expected to begin Thursday with a hearing to ultimately determine what will happen to Rosa Maria, who has brought to the United States without proper authorization by her mother when she was three months old. \n \n Rosa Maria\u2019s story highlights the newfound relentlessness in immigration arrests and detentions. Schools, churches, courthouses and hospitals\u2014once \u201csafe zones\u201d from immigrant detention\u2014are now open to arrests. \n \n \u201cThis wouldn\u2019t have happened during the [Barack] Obama administration,\u201d one of Rosa Maria\u2019s lawyers, Alex Galvez, told Newsweek. \u201cThis current administration wants to send a clear message to all undocumented immigrants\u2014that if you want to go to [a] hospital, you better think twice about it because you might be deported.\u201d \n \n For years, Hernandez and her mother have lived in Laredo, Texas, a small city of 250,000 residents on the U.S.-Mexico border. Rosa Maria suffered from gallstones and was in need of emergency surgery. Doctors in Laredo informed her mother, Felipa De La Cruz, who is also undocumented, that the nearest children\u2019s hospital capable of doing the operation was in Corpus Christi, a port city two and half hours away by car. \n \n That presented a problem for De La Cruz: She would have to drive through a Border Patrol checkpoint near Freer, Texas. Instead of taking the risk of being detained and delaying her daughter\u2019s operation, De La Cruz asked one of Rosa Maria\u2019s cousins, Aurora Cantu, to take her instead. Rosa Maria\u2019s doctors in Laredo gave Cantu a notarized letter to present at the checkpoint notifying the officers that she was transporting an undocumented person to receive emergency medical services. \n \n When she arrived at the checkpoint, Border Patrol officers informed her that she was allowed to drive her cousin to the hospital, but they also told her that two agents would be driving right behind them straight to Corpus Christi. \n \n After the operation was complete, Rosa Maria was taken to a hospital room where the two Border Patrol officers who followed them there stood waiting. That same night, Leticia Gonzalez, an immigration attorney from San Antonio, was informed about Rosa Maria\u2019s case and rushed over to Driscoll. \n \n By the time the lawyer arrived, there were five armed and fully uniformed Border Patrol agents waiting outside Rosa Maria's door, she said, adding that hospital staff did not allow her to go into Rosa Maria's room. She then threatened the agents and the hospital staff that she would go on one of the city\u2019s popular Spanish radio stations and tell the public that she wasn\u2019t allowed to see her client. The hospital and the agents obliged. \n \n Newsweek contacted Driscoll Children\u2019s Hospital, but officials refused to discuss the hospital\u2019s policy regarding immigration agents on the premises. They also did not confirm Hernandez\u2019s account due to privacy laws with respect to their patients. The hospital was embroiled in controversy in September when NPR reported that the undocumented parents of a two-month-old infant receiving treatment were detained by immigration officials upon arrival in May. \n \n As her attorney, Gonzalez was informed by the agents that they were taking Rosa Maria to a detention center in Houston. Then, about an hour later, the agents told her that the 10-year-old would instead be taken by an ambulance to a detention center in San Antonio later Wednesday afternoon. Gonzalez petitioned the agents to allow Rosa Maria to be discharged from the custody of her grandfather, a U.S. permanent resident, who was on his way to the hospital from Laredo. They refused. \n \n As the time approached for Rosa Maria\u2019s removal, Gonzalez was shocked to see that an immigration officer was preparing to ride in the back of the ambulance with Rosa Maria and her cousin. Gonzalez successfully petitioned that the officer instead ride in the front. \n \n \u201cThis 10-year-old child has cerebral palsy\u2014she has the mental capacity closer to a 5- or 6-year old,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat good does it do to have an armed immigration officer riding with her in the back of an ambulance?\u201d \n \n According to Galvez, who is based in Los Angeles, California, the Department of Homeland Security will now determine whether or not it's best to allow Rosa Maria to go back home to her mother. The process usually takes longer than two months, but Galvez has been assured by Homeland Security that they will expedite the process given the circumstances. \n \n \n \n \"They told me we should expect to hear back in about two to three weeks,\" he said. \n \n \n \n In the meantime, Rosa Maria will live at the Bexar County Juvenile Detention Center, where visitors are allowed to come and check up on her\u2014only if said visitors are U.S. citizens. \n \n \n \n \"As we were taking out of the hospital, [Rosa Maria] looked visibly shaken,\" Gonzalez said. \"The only thing this child wants is her mom.\" \n \n \n \n For her part, De La Cruz is glad is doing well\u2014Hernandez told Newsweek that Rosa Maria was released in stable condition\u2014but worries about what awaits her at Bexar. \n \n \n \n \"I've always been at her side, and now that she needs me I'm not,\" she told Telemundo on Wednesday. \"I have no idea how they're going to treat her. I'm scared.\" \n \n Correction: An earlier version of this story misidentified which Homeland Security agency was involved in the case. It was the Customs and Border Protection, not Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The story was also updated to include a comment from Customs and Border Protection on Thursday afternoon. Also, an earlier version misidentified the name of Rosa Maria's lawyer. Her name is Leticia Gonzalez. ||||| A 10-year-old girl with cerebral palsy has been detained by federal immigration authorities in Texas after she passed through a Border Patrol checkpoint on her way to a hospital to undergo emergency gall bladder surgery. \n \n The girl, Rosamaria Hernandez, who was brought over the border illegally to live in Laredo, Tex., when she was three months old, was being transferred from a medical center in Laredo to a hospital in Corpus Christi around 2 a.m. on Tuesday when Border Patrol agents stopped the ambulance she was riding in, her family said. The agents allowed her to continue to Driscoll Children\u2019s Hospital, the family said, but followed the ambulance the rest of the way there, then waited outside her room until she was released from the hospital. \n \n By Wednesday evening, according to family members and advocates involved in her case, immigration agents had taken her to a facility in San Antonio where migrant children who arrive alone in the United States from Central America are usually held, even though her parents, who both lack legal status, live 150 miles away in Laredo. \n \n Her placement there highlighted the unusual circumstances of her case: The federal government maintains detention centers for adult immigrants it plans to deport, facilities for families who arrive at the border together and shelters for children who come by themselves, known as unaccompanied minors. But it is rare, if not unheard-of, for a child already living in the United States to be arrested \u2014 particularly one with a serious medical condition.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 An ICE \"sensitive locations\" directive says federal agents shouldn't try to enforce the law at such locations except under \"exigent circumstances.\" But the family of Rosamaria Hernandez, a 10-year-old girl with cerebral palsy who had gallbladder surgery at a hospital in Corpus Christi, Texas, says ICE agents stalked her at the hospital, then took her to a San Antonio detention center for migrant kids\u2014all while her parents, also illegal immigrants, are at their home in Laredo 150 miles away. Arresting a minor already living in the US, especially one with a medical issue, is a move the New York Times is calling \"rare, if not unheard-of.\" It's also one that's prompted Rep. Joaquin Castro to issue a challenge to President Trump and Elaine Duke, the acting secretary of Homeland Security. \"Show that this enforcement operation is prioritizing a dangerous criminal,\" Castro says in a statement. This all started when Rosamaria\u2014brought to the US from Mexico as an infant by her parents, who hoped to get better treatment for her cerebral palsy\u2014was rushed by ambulance from a Laredo medical center to Driscoll Children's Hospital for the emergency procedure. The Corpus Christi Caller-Times notes Rosamaria was with her cousin, a US citizen. The trip Tuesday meant the ambulance passed a Border Patrol checkpoint, and while agents let the ambulance go, they followed it, her family says. ICE agents hovered outside Rosamaria's room until she was released, then took her to the San Antonio detention center, Leticia Hernandez, an attorney for the family, tells Newsweek. Now, while Rosamaria's family and lawyers vie for her release from the center, only US citizens can visit her, per Newsweek. \"The only thing this child wants is her mom,\" Hernandez says.",

    "document": "How do I know him? Where have I seen him? The Man in the Hat looked familiar, I thought, as I peered over at him a second time. It was Christmas Eve 2017. My family and I were about to be seated at a quaint restaurant in Manhattan\u2019s West Village. We had just come from Gramercy Park\u2014on the one night each year when the exclusive park (accessible only to nearby residents with special keys) opens its gates to outsiders. There had been carols. People had sung with abandon. In short, it was a magical night. I was happy. Amid the glow of candles and soft lighting, I strained to look again at the Man in the Hat. He was part of a small group that had just exited the main dining room. They were now gathering their belongings, likely vacating what was to be our table. And then it clicked. He looks just like . . . no, couldn\u2019t be. Could it? A student of Karma, I found myself seizing the moment. Whereas a decade ago I would have turned and fled the restaurant at the prospect of being in the same place as this man, many years of personal-counseling work (both trauma-specific and spiritual) had led me to a place where I now embrace opportunities to move into spaces that allow me to break out of old patterns of retreat or denial. At the same moment I stepped toward the Man in the Hat and began to ask, \u201cYou\u2019re not . . . ?,\u201d he stepped toward me with a warm, incongruous smile and said, \u201cLet me introduce myself. I\u2019m Ken Starr.\u201d An introduction was indeed necessary. This was, in fact, the first time I had met him. I found myself shaking his hand even as I struggled to decipher the warmth he evinced. After all, in 1998, this was the independent prosecutor who had investigated me, a former White House intern; the man whose staff, accompanied by a group of F.B.I. agents (Starr himself was not there), had hustled me into a hotel room near the Pentagon and informed me that unless I cooperated with them I could face 27 years in prison. This was the man who had turned my 24-year-old life into a living hell in his effort to investigate and prosecute President Bill Clinton on charges that would eventually include obstruction of justice and lying under oath\u2014lying about having maintained a long-term extramarital relationship with me. Ken Starr asked me several times if I was \u201cdoing O.K.\u201d A stranger might have surmised from his tone that he had actually worried about me over the years. His demeanor, almost pastoral, was somewhere between avuncular and creepy. He kept touching my arm and elbow, which made me uncomfortable. I turned and introduced him to my family. Bizarre as it may sound, I felt determined, then and there, to remind him that, 20 years before, he and his team of prosecutors hadn\u2019t hounded and terrorized just me but also my family\u2014threatening to prosecute my mom (if she didn\u2019t disclose the private confidences I had shared with her), hinting that they would investigate my dad\u2019s medical practice, and even deposing my aunt, with whom I was eating dinner that night. And all because the Man in the Hat, standing in front of me, had decided that a frightened young woman could be useful in his larger case against the president of the United States. Understandably, I was a bit thrown. (It was also confusing for me to see \u201cKen Starr\u201d as a human being. He was there, after all, with what appeared to be his family.) I finally gathered my wits about me\u2014after an internal command of Get it together. \u201cThough I wish I had made different choices back then,\u201d I stammered, \u201cI wish that you and your office had made different choices, too.\u201d In hindsight, I later realized, I was paving the way for him to apologize. But he didn\u2019t. He merely said, with the same inscrutable smile, \u201cI know. It was unfortunate.\u201d It had been nearly 20 years since 1998. The next month would mark the 20th anniversary of the Starr investigation expanding to include me. The 20th anniversary of my name becoming public for the first time. And the 20th anniversary of an annus horribilis that would almost end Clinton\u2019s presidency, consume the nation\u2019s attention, and alter the course of my life. By Jeffrey Markowitz/Sygma/Getty Images. \n \n If I have learned anything since then, it is that you cannot run away from who you are or from how you\u2019ve been shaped by your experiences. Instead, you must integrate your past and pres\u00adent. As Salman Rushdie observed after the fatwa was issued against him, \u201cThose who do not have power over the story that dominates their lives, power to retell it, rethink it, deconstruct it, joke about it, and change it as times change, truly are powerless, because they cannot think new thoughts.\u201d I have been working toward this realization for years. I have been trying to find that power\u2014a particularly Sisyphean task for a person who has been gaslighted. To be blunt, I was diagnosed several years ago with post-traumatic stress disorder, mainly from the ordeal of having been publicly outed and ostracized back then. My trauma expedition has been long, arduous, painful, and expensive. And it\u2019s not over. (I like to joke that my tombstone will read, MUTATIS MUTANDIS\u2014\u201cWith Changes Being Made.\u201d) I\u2019ve lived for so long in the House of Gaslight, clinging to my experiences as they unfolded in my 20s. But as I find myself reflecting on what happened, I\u2019ve also come to understand how my trauma has been, in a way, a microcosm of a larger, national one. Both clinically and observationally, something fundamental changed in our society in 1998, and it is changing again as we enter the second year of the Trump presidency in a post-Cosby-Ailes-O\u2019Reilly-Weinstein-Spacey-Whoever-Is-Next world. The Starr investigation and the subsequent impeachment trial of Bill Clinton amounted to a crisis that Americans arguably endured collectively\u2014some of us, obviously, more than others. It was a shambolic morass of a scandal that dragged on for 13 months, and many politicians and citizens became collateral damage\u2014along with the nation\u2019s capacity for mercy, measure, and perspective. Certainly, the events of that year did not constitute a war or a terrorist attack or a financial recession. They didn\u2019t constitute a natural catastrophe or a medical pandemic or what experts refer to as \u201cBig T\u201d traumas. But something had shifted nonetheless. And even after the Senate voted in 1999 to acquit President Clinton on two articles of impeachment, we could not escape the sense of upheaval and partisan division that lingered, settled in, and stayed. Maybe you remember or have heard stories about how \u201cthe scandal\u201d saturated television and radio; newspapers, magazines, and the Internet; Saturday Night Live and the Sunday-morning opinion programs; dinner-party conversation and watercooler discussions; late-night monologues and political talk shows (definitely the talk shows). In The Washington Post alone, there were 125 articles written about this crisis\u2014in just the first 10 days. Many parents felt compelled to discuss sexual issues with their children earlier than they might have wanted to. They had to explain why \u201clying\u201d\u2014even if the president did it\u2014was not acceptable behavior. The press was navigating unexplored terrain, too. Anonymous sources seemed to emerge almost daily with new (and often false or meaningless) revelations. There was a new commingling of traditional news, talk radio, tabloid television, and online rumor mills (fake news, anyone?). With the introduction of the World Wide Web (in 1992-93) and two new cable news networks (Fox News and MSNBC in 1996), the lines began to blur between fact and opinion, news and gossip, private lives and public shaming. The Internet had become such a propulsive force driving the flow of information that when the Republican-led Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives decided to publish Ken Starr\u2019s commission\u2019s \u201cfindings\u201d online\u2014just two days after he had delivered them\u2014it meant that (for me personally) every adult with a modem could instantaneously peruse a copy and learn about my private conversations, my personal musings (lifted from my home computer), and, worse yet, my sex life. Americans young and old, red and blue, watched day and night. We watched a beleaguered president and the embattled and often disenchanted members of his administration as they protected him. We watched a First Lady and First Daughter move through the year with grit and grace. We watched a special prosecutor get pilloried (though some thought he deserved it). We watched an American family\u2014my family\u2014as a mother was forced to testify against her child and as a father was forced to take his daughter to be fingerprinted at the Federal Building. We watched the wholesale dissection of a young, unknown woman\u2014me\u2014who, due to legal quarantine, was unable to speak out on her own behalf. How, then, to get a handle, today, on what exactly happened back then? \n \n One useful viewpoint is that of cognitive linguist George Lakoff. In his book Moral Politics: What Conservatives Know That Liberals Don\u2019t, Lakoff observes that the connective fiber of our country is often best represented through the metaphor of family: e.g., \u201cour Founding Fathers,\u201d \u201cUncle Sam,\u201d the concept of sending our sons and daughters to war. Lakoff goes on to argue that, \u201cfor conservatives, the nation is conceptualized (implicitly and unconsciously) as a Strict Father family and, for liberals, as a Nurturant Parent family.\u201d Addressing the scandal itself, he asserts that Clinton was widely perceived as \u201cthe naughty child\u201d and that, in line with the filial metaphor, \u201ca family matter [had turned] into an affair of state.\u201d Thus, in many ways, the crack in the foundation of the presidency was also a crack in our foundation at home. Moreover, the nature of the violation\u2014an extramarital relationship\u2014struck at the heart of one of humanity\u2019s most complicated moral issues: infidelity. (You\u2019ll forgive me if I leave that topic right there.) The result, I believe, was that in 1998 the person to whom we would typically turn for reassurance and comfort during a national crisis was remote and unavailable. The country, at that stage, had no consistent, Rooseveltian voice of calm or reason or empathy to make sense of the chaos. Instead, our Nurturer in Chief, because of his own actions as much as the subterfuge of his enemies, was a figurative \u201cabsent father.\u201d As a society, we went through this together. And ever since, the scandal has had an epigenetic quality, as if our cultural DNA has slowly been altered to ensure its longevity. If you can believe it, there has been at least one significant reference in the press to that unfortunate spell in our history every day for the past 20 years. Every. Single. Day. The fog of 1998 has lodged in our consciousness for many reasons. The Clintons have remained pivotal political figures on the global stage. Their disparagement has been vigorously abetted by \u201cthis vast right-wing conspiracy,\u201d as Hil\u00adla\u00adry Clinton famously put it. And the Clinton presidency segued into a bitter electoral deadlock: the contested Bush v. Gore showdown, which would usher in an era so turbulent that it would leave the lessons of the Clinton years altogether murky. In succession came the unthinkable (the attacks of September 11, 2001), protracted conflicts (the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan), the Great Recession, a state of perpetual gridlock in Washington, and then the daily bedlam central to Trumpism. No matter how these subsequent events dwarfed the impeachment and subsumed our attention, maybe, just maybe, the long, unimpeded derivation of this drama, ever since, is partly the result of 1998 having been a year of unremitting crisis that we all endured but never actually resolved\u2014a low-grade collective trauma, perhaps? I discussed this idea with psychologist Jack Saul, founding director of New York\u2019s International Trauma Studies Program and author of Collective Trauma, Collective Healing. \u201cCollective trauma,\u201d he told me, \u201cusually refers to the shared injuries to a population\u2019s social ecology due to a major catastrophe or chronic oppression, poverty, and disease. While the events of 1998 in the United States do not fit neatly into such a definition, they may have led to some of the features we often associate with collective traumas: social rupturing and a profound sense of distress, the challenging of long-held assumptions about the world and national identity, a constricted public narrative, and a process of scapegoating and dehumanization.\u201d Until recently (thank you, Harvey Weinstein), historians hadn\u2019t really had the perspective to fully process and acknowledge that year of shame and spectacle. And as a culture, we still haven\u2019t properly examined it. Re-framed it. Integrated it. And transformed it. My hope, given the two dec\u00adades that have passed, is that we are now at a stage where we can untangle the complexities and context (maybe even with a little compassion), which might help lead to an eventual healing\u2014and a systemic transformation. As Haruki Murakami has written, \u201cWhen you come out of the storm you won\u2019t be the same person who walked in. That\u2019s what this storm\u2019s all about.\u201d Who were we then? Who are we now? \n \n \u2018I\u2019m so sorry you were so alone.\u201d Those seven words undid me. They were written in a recent private exchange I had with one of the brave women leading the #MeToo movement. Somehow, coming from her\u2014a recognition of sorts on a deep, soulful level\u2014they landed in a way that cracked me open and brought me to tears. Yes, I had received many letters of support in 1998. And, yes (thank God!), I had my family and friends to support me. But by and large I had been alone. So. Very. Alone. Publicly Alone\u2014abandoned most of all by the key figure in the crisis, who actually knew me well and intimately. That I had made mistakes, on that we can all agree. But swimming in that sea of Aloneness was terrifying. Isolation is such a powerful tool to the subjugator. And yet I don\u2019t believe I would have felt so isolated had it all happened today. One of the most inspiring aspects of this newly energized movement is the sheer number of women who have spoken up in support of one another. And the volume in numbers has translated into volume of public voice. Historically, he who shapes the story (and it is so often a he) creates \u201cthe truth.\u201d But this collective rise in decibel level has provided a resonance for women\u2019s narratives. If the Internet was a b\u00eate noire to me in 1998, its stepchild\u2014social media\u2014has been a savior for millions of women today (notwithstanding all the cyberbullying, online harassment, doxing, and slut-shaming). Virtually anyone can share her or his #MeToo story and be instantly welcomed into a tribe. In addition, the democratizing potential of the Internet to open up support networks and penetrate what used to be closed circles of power is something that was unavailable to me back then. Power, in that case, remained in the hands of the president and his minions, the Congress, the prosecutors, and the press. There are many more women and men whose voices and stories need to be heard before mine. (There are even some people who feel my White House experiences don\u2019t have a place in this movement, as what transpired between Bill Clinton and myself was not sexual assault, although we now recognize that it constituted a gross abuse of power.) And yet, everywhere I have gone for the past few months, I\u2019ve been asked about it. My response has been the same: I am in awe of the sheer courage of the women who have stood up and begun to confront entrenched beliefs and institutions. But as for me, my history, and how I fit in personally? I\u2019m sorry to say I don\u2019t have a definitive answer yet on the meaning of all of the events that led to the 1998 investigation; I am unpacking and reprocessing what happened to me. Over and over and over again. For two dec\u00adades, I have been working on myself, my trauma, and my healing. And, naturally, I have grappled with the rest of the world\u2019s interpretations and Bill Clinton\u2019s re-interpretations of what happened. But in truth, I have done this at arm\u2019s length. There have been so many barriers to this place of self-reckoning. The reason this is difficult is that I\u2019ve lived for such a long time in the House of Gaslight, clinging to my experiences as they unfolded in my 20s and railing against the untruths that painted me as an unstable stalker and Servicer in Chief. An inability to deviate from the internal script of what I actually experienced left little room for re-evaluation; I cleaved to what I \u201cknew.\u201d So often have I struggled with my own sense of agency versus victimhood. (In 1998, we were living in times in which women\u2019s sexuality was a marker of their agency\u2014\u201cowning desire.\u201d And yet, I felt that if I saw myself as in any way a victim, it would open the door to choruses of: \u201cSee, you did merely service him.\u201d) What it means to confront a long-held belief (one clung to like a life raft in the middle of the ocean) is to challenge your own perceptions and allow the pentimento painting that is hidden beneath the surface to emerge and be seen in the light of a new day. ||||| How do I know him? Where have I seen him? The Man in the Hat looked familiar, I thought, as I peered over at him a second time. It was Christmas Eve 2017. My family and I were about to be seated at a quaint restaurant in Manhattan\u2019s West Village. We had just come from Gramercy Park\u2014on the one night each year when the exclusive park (accessible only to nearby residents with special keys) opens its gates to outsiders. There had been carols. People had sung with abandon. In short, it was a magical night. I was happy. Amid the glow of candles and soft lighting, I strained to look again at the Man in the Hat. He was part of a small group that had just exited the main dining room. They were now gathering their belongings, likely vacating what was to be our table. And then it clicked. He looks just like . . . no, couldn\u2019t be. Could it? A student of Karma, I found myself seizing the moment. Whereas a decade ago I would have turned and fled the restaurant at the prospect of being in the same place as this man, many years of personal-counseling work (both trauma-specific and spiritual) had led me to a place where I now embrace opportunities to move into spaces that allow me to break out of old patterns of retreat or denial. At the same moment I stepped toward the Man in the Hat and began to ask, \u201cYou\u2019re not . . . ?,\u201d he stepped toward me with a warm, incongruous smile and said, \u201cLet me introduce myself. I\u2019m Ken Starr.\u201d An introduction was indeed necessary. This was, in fact, the first time I had met him. I found myself shaking his hand even as I struggled to decipher the warmth he evinced. After all, in 1998, this was the independent prosecutor who had investigated me, a former White House intern; the man whose staff, accompanied by a group of F.B.I. agents (Starr himself was not there), had hustled me into a hotel room near the Pentagon and informed me that unless I cooperated with them I could face 27 years in prison. This was the man who had turned my 24-year-old life into a living hell in his effort to investigate and prosecute President Bill Clinton on charges that would eventually include obstruction of justice and lying under oath\u2014lying about having maintained a long-term extramarital relationship with me. Ken Starr asked me several times if I was \u201cdoing O.K.\u201d A stranger might have surmised from his tone that he had actually worried about me over the years. His demeanor, almost pastoral, was somewhere between avuncular and creepy. He kept touching my arm and elbow, which made me uncomfortable. I turned and introduced him to my family. Bizarre as it may sound, I felt determined, then and there, to remind him that, 20 years before, he and his team of prosecutors hadn\u2019t hounded and terrorized just me but also my family\u2014threatening to prosecute my mom (if she didn\u2019t disclose the private confidences I had shared with her), hinting that they would investigate my dad\u2019s medical practice, and even deposing my aunt, with whom I was eating dinner that night.

My response has been the same: I am in awe of the sheer courage of the women who have stood up and begun to confront entrenched beliefs and institutions. But as for me, my history, and how I fit in personally? I\u2019m sorry to say I don\u2019t have a definitive answer yet on the meaning of all of the events that led to the 1998 investigation; I am unpacking and reprocessing what happened to me. Over and over and over again. For two dec\u00adades, I have been working on myself, my trauma, and my healing. And, naturally, I have grappled with the rest of the world\u2019s interpretations and Bill Clinton\u2019s re-interpretations of what happened. But in truth, I have done this at arm\u2019s length. There have been so many barriers to this place of self-reckoning. The reason this is difficult is that I\u2019ve lived for such a long time in the House of Gaslight, clinging to my experiences as they unfolded in my 20s and railing against the untruths that painted me as an unstable stalker and Servicer in Chief. An inability to deviate from the internal script of what I actually experienced left little room for re-evaluation; I cleaved to what I \u201cknew.\u201d So often have I struggled with my own sense of agency versus victimhood. (In 1998, we were living in times in which women\u2019s sexuality was a marker of their agency\u2014\u201cowning desire.\u201d And yet, I felt that if I saw myself as in any way a victim, it would open the door to choruses of: \u201cSee, you did merely service him.\u201d) What it means to confront a long-held belief (one clung to like a life raft in the middle of the ocean) is to challenge your own perceptions and allow the pentimento painting that is hidden beneath the surface to emerge and be seen in the light of a new day.",

While at a Manhattan restaurant, she ran into none other than Kenneth Starr, the special investigator who turned her into a household name in 1998. This, surprisingly, was the first time Lewinsky had ever met him, and she describes his demeanor as \"somewhere between avuncular and creepy.\" He asked multiple times if she was \"doing OK\" and kept touching her arm and elbow, \"which made me uncomfortable.\" Then Lewinsky told him, in what she later realized was an attempt to elicit an apology, \u201cThough I wish I had made different choices back then, I wish that you and your office had made different choices, too.\" Starr didn't apologize, however. He merely said, \"I know. It was unfortunate.\" The anecdote precedes Lewinsky's revelation that she was diagnosed with PTSD several years ago, and she suggests the nation suffered a similar kind of trauma. \"Both clinically and observationally, something fundamental changed in our society in 1998, and it is changing again as we enter the second year of the Trump presidency in a post-Cosby-Ailes-O\u2019Reilly-Weinstein-Spacey-Whoever-Is-Next world,\" she writes. The nation lost its \"capacity for mercy, measure, and perspective,\" and bitter partisan differences \"settled in.\" Lewinsky adds that while she has previously described her relations with Clinton as consensual, she has come to realize that assessment is \"complicated,\" given the \"power imbalances\" at play. She also reveals that a leader of the #MeToo movement expressed a sentiment in a private exchange that \"undid\" her: \"I'm sorry you were so alone.\" (Read the full essay.)",

At about 11:45 a.m. Aug. 11, Williams' assistant grew concerned. He slipped a note under the door, then picked the lock. He found the comedian dressed in a long black T-shirt and belted black jeans hanging by a nylon belt in a closet door frame. The actor, who was being treated for severe depression, also had cuts on his wrist.

Susan told investigators Williams often received gifts from his USO tours with the military, and that the knife was likely from her husband's collection. \n \n A pair of black sneakers were next to the chair.

His pill dispenser had been refilled the day before, but the medications remained undisturbed in their appointed daily slots, Sunday through Saturday. The investigator asked Susan if Robin had ever mentioned suicide \"as a solution to a significant health issue.\" After searching through Williams' iPad, which was near his body, Investigator D. Harris found only web browsers open to information about medications. A sweep of his iPhone revealed no texts or messages that indicated he was suicidal. \n \n \"There were no reflective devices or pornography near the body\" the report says. The investigator says he \"frankly asked\" if Williams had any \"history of autoerotic asphyxia. Mrs. Williams stated that he did not.\" However, one person interviewed said Williams had worked on a movie years earlier in which his character's son accidentally died by autoerotic asphyxiation. That person added that \"the scene was very difficult and emotional for Williams\" and he may have researched hanging during filming. \n \n A search of Williams' iPhone, iPad and home computer revealed no search histories for suicide or hanging. However, the investigator writes that he later watched the movie in question \u2014 the dark comedy World's Greatest Dad \u2014 and said the character's son was found \"seated on the floor, learning forward with a ligature around the neck secured by a belt\" \u2014 very similar to the scene of Williams' death. \n \n The Marin Sheriff's Office previously drew criticism for releasing candid details about Williams' death but said the disclosure was necessary under the California Public Records Act.

    "document": "Churchill described the German battleship Tirpitz as \"the beast\" Throughout most of World War II, Allied bombers tried repeatedly to sink the Tirpitz, Germany's biggest battleship and a bete noir of Britain's wartime leader Winston Churchill, who took to calling it 'the beast'. \n \n On Wednesday, tree experts at the annual meeting of the European Geosciences Union showed why they failed to do so until late 1944 \n \n \"The story was in the tree rings,\" said Claudia Hartl, a researcher at Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany. \n \n The unlikely evidence of WWII battles was uncovered during the summer of 2016, when Hartl led students on a routine survey of forests around Kafjord, one of dozens of fjords along the northern coast of Norway. \n \n \"We got back to the lab and measured the tree rings, and saw that they were very narrow\u2014in some cases nearly absent\u2014for 1945,\" she told AFP. \n \n The forests, in other words, had been hit by an environmental cataclysm. \n \n \"Of course we wondered, why is that?\" \n \n The first suspect was insect infestation, which can come suddenly and have severe impacts, especially in high-latitude boreal forests. \n \n Driven north of their historic range by climate change, mountain pine beetles, for example, have recently devastated large swathes of forests in Canada, sometimes in a single year. \n \n But there were no known insect in northern Scandinavia that could have delivered that kind of environmental shock in the middle of the 20th century. \n \n \"It wasn't until we spoke to a local scientist based in Tromso that we made the connection to the Tirpitz,\" said Scott St. George, a geographer at The University of Minnesota's Institute on the Environment who took part in the research. \n \n The Tirpitz and its crew of 2500, it turned out, had retreated into northern Norway's watery labyrinth to escape detection. In the pre-satellite era, even a 250-metre (820-foot) behemoth wasn't that easy to spot. \n \n But Allied aerial scouts finally found it, and the attacks began. \n \n The Germans, however, had a counter-plan: producing vast quantities of artificial fog, enough to hide the ship and surrounding area from aerial view. \n \n And that's where the tree rings come in. \n \n A 1944 picture shows smoke rising from the Tirpitz following an attack by allied bombers in a Norwegian fjord \n \n Arboreal casualties \n \n \"The smoke drifted into the forests surrounding the fjord and damaged nearby pine and birch trees, leaving behind a distinctive and unusual 'fingerprint',\" St. George told AFP. \n \n The study of tree rings\u2014called dendrochronology, literally, \"timeline of trees\"\u2014is used by climate scientists to trace changes in temperature, rainfall or river flows reaching back hundreds, even thousands, of years. \n \n The concentric circles found in temperate zone tree trunks can also date the age of buildings, shipwrecks, musical instruments, painting frames or anything else made from temperate-zone wood. \n \n Because trees in the tropics grow continually, they generally do not produce rings, which show growth spurts during spring and summer. \n \n To investigate further, Hartl returned last summer to the scene of the battle, to see how far the damage had spread. \n \n She established five test sites ranging in distance from a few hundred meters from the fjord where the Tirpitz was berthed, to about ten kilometres. \n \n Near where the ship once lay, more than 60 percent of the trees showed virtually no growth in 1945. All of them were affected to some degree. \n \n Gaps in the forest where young trees sprouted up in the 1950s suggest the chemical fog caused arboreal fatalities too. \n \n As far as four kilometres away, more than half the tree were severely affected, taking eight years on average to fully recover. \n \n Pine trees\u2014which keep their needles for up to seven years\u2014were hit hardest. \"Being stripped bare would have been a more difficult challenge for that species,\" St. George explained. \n \n The artificial fog that denuded the trees was likely made from chlorosulphuric acid which, when mixed with water, produces a thick, white vapour. \n \n German ships has special teams equipped with gas masks to generate the smoky shroud. \n \n Despite its firepower, the Tirpitz never saw much action. \n \n In October 1944, the German naval command moved it to Tromso, where it served as a moble artillery platform until a squadron of 32 British Lancaster bombers sent it to the bottom of the harbour the following month. \n \n Explore further: Tropical trees maintain high carbon accumulation rates into old age ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Claudia Hartl: \"You don't normally see trees in this region without rings\" \n \n The relentless campaign to find and sink Germany's WWII battleship, the Tirpitz, left its mark on the landscape that is evident even today. \n \n The largest vessel in Hitler's Kriegsmarine, it was stationed for much of the war along the Norwegian coast to deter an Allied invasion. \n \n The German navy would hide the ship in fjords and screen it with chemical fog. \n \n This \"smoke\" did enormous damage to the surrounding trees which is recorded in their growth rings. \n \n Claudia Hartl, from the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany, stumbled across the impact while examining pines at K\u00e5fjord near Alta. \n \n The dendrochronologist was collecting wood cores to build up a picture of past climate in the area. Severe cold and even infestation from insects can severely stunt annual growth in a stand, but neither of these causes could explain the total absence of rings seen in some trees dated to 1945. \n \n Image copyright Claudia Hartl Image caption Some had a ring but you would hardly see it \n \n A colleague suggested it could have something to do with the Tirpitz, which was anchored the previous year at K\u00e5fjord where it was attacked by Allied bombers. \n \n Archive documents show the ship released chlorosulphuric acid to camouflage its position. \n \n \"We think this artificial smoke damaged the needles on the trees,\" Dr Hartl told BBC News. \n \n \"If trees don't have needles they can't photosynthesise and they can't produce biomass. In pine trees, needles usually last from three to seven years because they're evergreens. So, if the trees lose their needles, it can take a very long time for them to recover.\" \n \n Image copyright Imperial War Museums Image caption The Tirpitz pictured in K\u00e5fjord with the smokescreen seen drifting across the water \n \n In one tree, there is no growth seen for nine years from 1945. \"Afterwards, it recovered but it took 30 years to get back to normal growth. It's still there; it's still alive, and it's a very impressive tree,\" Dr Hartl said. \n \n In other pines, rings are present but they are extremely thin - easy to miss. As expected, sampling shows the impacts falling off with distance. But it is only at 4km that trees start to display no effects. \n \n The Tirpitz sustained some damage at K\u00e5fjord. However, a continuous seek-and-destroy campaign eventually caught up with the battleship and it was sunk by RAF Lancasters in late 1944 in Tromso fjord further to the west. \n \n Dr Hartl believes her \"warfare dendrochronology\" will find similar cases elsewhere. \n \n \"I think it's really interesting that the effects of one engagement are still evident in the forests of northern Norway more than 70 years later. In other places in Europe, they also used this artificial smoke and maybe also other chemicals. So perhaps you can find similar patterns and effects from WWII.\" \n \n The Mainz researcher presented her research here at the European Geosciences Union (EGU) General Assembly in Vienna, Austria. \n \n Image copyright Claudia Hartl Image caption Sampling shows the impacts falling off with distance \n \n Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",

A local scientist had a theory, she explained Wednesday at the annual meeting of the European Geosciences Union: that it had something to do with the Tirpitz. The 820-foot battleship was the largest in Hitler's navy, and the BBC reports it spent much of WWII anchored and hiding along Norway's coast, including in K\u00e5fjord, where Hartl observed the tree-ring anomaly. But then Allied forces found it, and that's when the trees suffered, believes Hartl. The Nazi ship released chlorosulphuric acid as a sort of \"chemical fog\" to try to cloak it from aerial enemy forces, and Hartl now believes the acid caused damage to the trees' needles. \"If trees don't have needles they can't photosynthesize and they can't produce biomass,\" she explains, noting recovery can be a multi-year process as pine trees can retain their needles for as long as seven years. And that jibes with what she found: In one case, a tree had no growth for nine years and took three decades to revert to \"normal growth.\" Near where the ship was stationed all the trees she studied were affected, with more than 60% not growing at all in 1945. She found the impact on the rings diminished with distance, with trees about 2.5 miles away starting to be unaffected. As for the Tirpitz's ploy, it didn't work: It was ultimately sunk.

The search continued on Friday for missing EgyptAir flight 804, which disappeared from the radar while carrying... (Associated Press) \n \n CAIRO (AP) \u2014 Smoke was detected in multiple places on EgyptAir flight 804 moments before it plummeted into the Mediterranean, but the cause of the crash that killed all 66 on board remains unclear, the French air accident investigation agency said on Saturday. \n \n Agency spokesman Sebastien Barthe told The Associated Press in Paris that the plane's automatic detection system sent messages indicating smoke a few minutes before the plane disappeared from radar while flying over the east Mediterranean early on Thursday morning. \n \n The messages, he explained, \"generally mean the start of a fire,\" but he added: \"We are drawing no conclusions from this. Everything else is pure conjecture.\" \n \n Looking for clues to whether terrorists may have brought down the Airbus A320, investigators have been poring over the passenger list and questioned ground crew members at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, from which the plane took off. \n \n The aircraft had been cruising normally in clear skies on a nighttime flight to Cairo early Thursday when it suddenly lurched left, then right, spun all the way around and plummeted 38,000 feet (11,582.4 meters) into the sea, never issuing a distress signal. \n \n Search crews are scouring for further wreckage of the aircraft. Experts said answers will come only with an examination of the wreckage and the plane's cockpit voice and flight data recorders, commonly known as black boxes. \n \n Planes and vessels from Egypt and five other countries \u2014 Greece, Britain, France, the United States and Cyprus \u2014 continued searching a wide area of the eastern Mediterranean on Saturday, a day after the Egyptian military found debris from the passenger jet in the sea 180 miles (290 kilometers) north of the Egyptian port city of Alexandria. \n \n The waters in the area are 8,000 to 10,000 feet deep (2,440 to 3,050 meters), and the pings from the black boxes can be detected up to a depth of 20,000 feet (6 kilometers). \n \n On Saturday, the Egyptian military released photographs of the debris from EgyptAir flight 804. The photos were posted on the Facebook page of the chief military spokesman. They appear to show the heavily-damaged remains of plane seats, life jackets \u2014 one of which was seemingly undamaged \u2014 and a scrap of cloth that looks to be part of a baby's purple and pink blanket or sleeping bag. \n \n The spokesman's Facebook page later posted a brief video that showed more debris, including what appeared to be a piece of blue carpet, seat belts, a shoe and what looked like a woman's white handbag. The short clip opened with aerial footage of an unidentified navy ship followed by a speed boat with five service members aboard heading toward floating debris. \n \n Egyptian authorities said they believe terrorism is a more likely explanation than equipment failure, and some aviation experts have said the erratic flight suggests a bomb blast or a struggle in the cockpit. But so far no hard evidence has emerged. \n \n No militant group has claimed to have brought down the aircraft. That is a contrast to the downing of a Russian jet in October over Egypt's Sinai Peninsula that killed all 224 on board. In that case, the Islamic State group's branch in Sinai issued a claim of responsibility within hours. On Friday, IS issued a statement on clashes with the Egyptian military in Sinai, but said nothing about the plane crash. \n \n Three European security officials said on Friday that the passenger manifest for Flight 804 contained no names on terrorism watch lists. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the investigation. The manifest was leaked online and has not been verified by the airline. \n \n Further checks are being conducted on relatives of the passengers. \n \n French aviation investigators have begun to check and question all baggage handlers, maintenance workers, gate agents and other ground crew members at Charles de Gaulle Airport who had a direct or indirect link to the plane before it took off, according to a French judicial official. The official was not authorized to discuss the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity. \n \n Whatever caused the aircraft to crash, the tragedy will most likely deepen Egypt's difficult predicament as it struggles to revive a battered economy and contain an increasingly resilient insurgency by Islamic militants. \n \n In the five years since the country was first mired in turmoil caused by a popular uprising against longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak, the lucrative tourism sector has been decimated, the value of the local currency has progressively fallen and domestic debt has mushroomed. \n \n While the latest tragedy may not reflect directly on security at Egypt's airports, as the Russian jet crash did in October, the country's association with another air disaster will impact negatively on tourism and the flow of foreign investment. \n \n In Paris, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said Saturday that he and other officials \u2014 including representatives of Paris Aeroport, the French prosecutor, EgyptAir, and the Egyptian ambassador to Paris \u2014 had met with about 100 family members to express \"our profound compassion\" over the crash. \n \n In a statement delivered to reporters following the meeting, he said: \"All the hypotheses are being examined \u2014 none are being favored.\" \n \n \"In the name of France, once more, I am expressing my solidarity, but also our affection ... for all those people who learned that a loved one, or even an entire family, have drowned in the sea \u2014 and who want to know, to know to be able to grieve. It's a difficult moment, a painful moment. I wanted to say it again: We're on their side.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Satter reported from Paris.

The end. \n \n And that\u2019s Beauty And The Beast in a nutshell, too \u2014 a story that\u2019s being pushed in our face again, with the caveat that Belle is now supposedly an \u2018inventor\u2019 who doesn\u2019t wear a corset. What a revolutionary step forward in the 21st century. \n \n Emma would argue, and has argued, that Disney\u2019s becoming more progressive. \n \n Watson said of the \u2018new\u2019 princess she plays: \n \n In the animated movie, it\u2019s her father who is the inventor, and we actually co-opted that for Belle\u2026. We created a backstory for her, which was that she had invented a kind of washing machine, so that, instead of doing laundry, she could sit and use that time to read instead. \n \n \n \n Again, Belle is clearly light years ahead. Cue derisive snort. \n \n Disney is clearly trying to rebrand itself with movies like Tangled, Brave and Frozen, neatly editing the word \u2018princess\u2019 out of the titles while placing a female character in the main role. \n \n But nothing has actually changed. The princesses are still rakishly thin, with pixie-like faces that stretch wider than their waists. \n \n Call that a normal-sized waist, Moana? (Picture: Disney) \n \n The women still play second fiddle to their more active, assertive male counterparts (particularly the hero Flynn Rider in Tangled). \n \n They speak far, far less than them, too (the two female protagonists and other women characters in Frozen spoke less than half the dialogue). \n \n Women actually speak LESS now in Disney cartoons than they did between 1930 and 1960 \u2014 plus there\u2019s also the fact that the three blockbusters with the least female dialogue from 2016 were made by Disney. \n \n Percentage of female dialogue in female-led Disney movies Brave (2012) 74 Sleeping Beauty (1959) 71 Cinderella (1950) 60 Tangled (2010) 52 Snow White (1937) 50 Frozen (2013) 41 The Little Mermaid (1989) 32 Beauty And The Beast (1991) 29 Princess And The Frog (2009) 25 Pochahontas (1995) 24 Mulan (1998) 23 Share \n \n Frozen is Disney\u2019s most popular princess-led movie of late, boasting two sister lead characters, but if that\u2019s a pro-women film then I\u2019m the bloomin\u2019 Pope. \n \n Putting on heels and a sparkly dress (or a gold one *cough, Emma*) and sashaying through a glass palace as Frozen\u2019s Elsa does doesn\u2019t make you a powerful woman, nor does falling in love with a beast as Belle does. \n \n Anyone who buys this rubbish about Emma Watson influencing Disney to make a more feminist movie needs their head examining. \n \n She\u2019ll still be sharing a True Love\u2019s Kiss\u2122 with the Beast who\u2019s been lusting after her for an hour and a half, as has Gaston, because she\u2019s so hot. \n \n No, it\u2019s not the actress\u2019s fault she\u2019s the perfect casting for a princess. \n \n But if Emma wanted little girls to stop buying dolls and start taking control of their lives, she wouldn\u2019t have signed up for a Disney movie.

Well, apparently, the very last thing you should do is ask her for a picture. \n \n While most people are still drooling over the 26-year-old star's sexy Vanity Fair photos (the underboob is REAL), some fans are stuck on one little detail from her interview with the magazine. \n \n It turns out the \"Beauty and the Beast\" star isn't big on taking selfies with her fans.

I just can't give that tracking data. \n \n Can you even blame her? People are crazy AF these days. Just ask Kendall Jenner's stalker. \n \n But don't worry, Emma doesn't brush passed her fans and disappear into thin air. She's not mean, she's just protective of herself.

I have to carefully pick and choose my moment to interact. \n \n She does make one exception, though, and it's for the little people. \n \n When am I a celebrity sighting versus when am I going to make someone's freakin' week?

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images) \n \n It was not unusual for the two alligators to lurk in the pond behind Fire Station 3 in Reedy Creek, Fla. Neither reptile was full-grown \u2014 one was a young juvenile and the other was about four or five feet long, whereas an adult male American alligator can stretch to about 11 feet. \n \n Perhaps it was the gators\u2019 smallish size. Perhaps it was ignorance about the dangers of feeding alligators. Whatever the reason, two Reedy Creek firefighters were spotted giving the predators food. \n \n Reedy Creek is the tax district, the equivalent of a county government, for Walt Disney World Resort. Fire Station 3 sits just outside the Magic Kingdom, to the west of Splash Mountain. It is about half a mile from Seven Seas Lagoon, which curves around Disney\u2019s Grand Floridian Resort and Spa. \n \n There, two months after the firefighters were admonished for feeding the animals, a gator \u2014 thought to be between four and seven feet long \u2014 fatally attacked a boy wading in the lagoon. \n \n [Disney\u2019s Magic Kingdom has made its gator and crocodile characters disappear] \n \n Claude Rogers, a communications captain, had warned that staff needed to stop giving food to the animals, in an email obtained by the Orlando Sentinel. \n \n \u201cIt was brought to our attention firefighters are feeding the alligators (this is illegal),\u201d Rogers wrote on April 20. \u201cThe communicators have found [one alligator] by the station, near the dumpster, and where they park their cars. As you can imagine this is making the communicators nervous because they are fearful of walking to their car and their leg becoming dinner. We have notified Animal Control to remove the alligator. In the interim could you ask your crews to stop feeding the gator.\u201d \n \n Here are tips for dealing with \"nuisance alligators\" in this PSA from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission) \n \n This was on the heels of another email from Dan Lewis, a Fire Station 3 dispatcher, who complained that the animals were scampering into the parking lot. \u201cWE are the ones who have to walk in that parking lot every day and in the dark,\u201d said Lewis in an email, per the Sentinel. \u201cThey are not docile gators, they are mean and they are out looking for food because people are feeding them. It\u2019s getting uncomfortable,\u201d he wrote. \n \n Two months later, for the first time in Disney World history \u2014 and a rare event in all of Florida \u2014 an alligator killed a child, a Nebraskan boy visiting with his family. \n \n On a Tuesday night in June, an alligator ambushed a 2-year-old boy, Lane Graves, who was wading in the artificial lagoon very close to shore. Matt Graves, Lane\u2019s father, attempted to save his son from the animal, believed to be between four and seven feet long. But it succeeded in pulling Lane into the dark water. During the attempted rescue in the lagoon, Matt was bitten by a second alligator, requiring antibiotics and stitches. \n \n In the wake of the tragedy, Disney installed warning signs about the presence of alligators and snakes, and removed crocodilian characters. Lane\u2019s parents sought privacy. \n \n [\u2018We are devastated,\u2019 family says of toddler killed in alligator attack at Disney resort] \n \n It is not apparent if the firefighter feedings in the station pond, which is an isolated body of water, are connected to the June attack. But avoiding attacks like this are one reason it is illegal to feed alligators in Florida. \u201cNo person shall intentionally feed, or entice with feed, any crocodilian unless held in captivity under a permit issued by the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission \u2026,\u201d according to a Florida rule. \n \n Crocodilians, which include alligators, are instinctively wary of people. When people feed gators, however, the animals may lose their fear of humans. So-called nuisance gators can in turn become aggressive, including biting off the hand that feeds them. Throughout Florida, environmental activists warn that feeding wild gators, particularly as a tourist attraction, has become too common. \n \n Should an alligator be spotted on park premises, Disney World told the AP in June its policy was to relocate small gators and call in a licensed trapper for larger animals. \n \n In an interview with the Sentinel, John Classe, the district administrator for Reedy Creek, said that he did not know if the larger gator behind the fire station had been removed. But he was skeptical the fire station animal was the killer. \n \n \u201cThe gator would have to travel across a couple roadways \u2026 to get over to the Seven Seas water body system, so it\u2019s not likely,\u201d he said. \n \n A half-mile is a feasible travel distance for an alligator, though the creatures spend the vast majority of time in water. And the wanderlust of any given gator can vary. A 2013 study tracking alligators as they moved through western Florida Everglades found quite a bit of diversity in river ranges. Many alligators were unable to be tracked either because they did not move far enough or their acoustic tags broke. \n \n [Alligators found eating human remains in Florida Everglades, police say] \n \n Of those that were tracked, some barely shifted in location, staying within a third of a mile. Others were roamers, using 40 miles as a home range over the course of the study. The average gator stuck to about a 10-mile stretch of river. \n \n A Disney representative said Wednesday she did not know if the larger alligator had been relocated, according to the Associated Press. Disney World\u2019s security team, when contacted late Wednesday night by The Washington Post, declined to comment as the public relations department had gone home for the day. ||||| Two months before an alligator killed a toddler at Walt Disney World, firefighters were warned to stop feeding the reptiles at one of the resort's fire stations. \n \n The admonitions were in emails from employees at Reedy Creek Emergency Services. Reedy Creek is the Disney-controlled taxing district that provides government services to the theme parks and surrounding areas. \n \n The emails were obtained through a public-records request made after an alligator snatched 2-year-old Lane Graves from the shore of the Seven Seas Lagoon on June 14 and drowned him while he was on vacation with family from Nebraska. The attack took place at Grand Floridian Resort & Spa. \n \n After that, many tourists came forward with their own stories of alligator sightings at Disney. One employee at the resort said at the time there was a problem with guests feeding the animals. \n \n According to the emails, firefighters were feeding at least one of two alligators hanging around Fire Station 3, located off Floridian Way on Maple Road less than a half mile from Seven Seas Lagoon and less than a mile from Grand Floridian. One gator was a baby. The second was estimated to be between 4 and 5 feet long. \n \n Reedy Creek District Administrator John Classe said he believes the feedings were not widespread throughout the resort. \n \n Feeding alligators is illegal because it causes the animals to lose their natural fear of humans. \n \n \"You would think that the firefighters would be a little bit more in tune with the trouble that could cause and not do it,\" said David Hitzig, executive director of the Busch Wildlife Center, a refuge and nature center in Jupiter. \"You would figure they would have more common sense than that. \u2026 When you feed an alligator, you're attracting it to people.\" \n \n On April 20, communications captain Claude Rogers sent an email to Reedy Creek's fire command staff. \n \n \"It was brought to our attention firefighters are feeding the alligators (this is illegal),\" Rogers' email said. \"The communicators have found [one alligator] by the station, near the dumpster, and where they park their cars. As you can imagine this is making the communicators nervous because they are fearful of walking to their car and their leg becoming dinner. We have notified Animal Control to remove the alligator. In the interim could you ask your crews to stop feeding the gator.\" \n \n Classe said Disney's animal-control department was contacted but he did not know whether either alligator was ever removed. Classe said the firefighters received \"just a talking to and reminding \u2014 `Guys and gals, we know this isn't right, so just don't.'\" \n \n A Disney spokeswoman did not know Wednesday afternoon whether the gator had been removed. \n \n Typically nuisance gators under 4 feet are relocated. Larger ones are trapped and killed by the state. The alligator that attacked Lane was estimated to be between 4 and 7 feet. \n \n After Rogers' initial email, he sent another one to Reedy Creek communications employees. \"Several people have expressed concern of becoming alligator food because the alligator is seen out of the pond near the building, by the dumpster, and near the cars,\" he wrote. \"The firefighters feeding the alligator only aggravates the situation..... Animal Control has been notified and I have spoken to B/C Brown requesting they tell the firefighters to stop feeding the alligator.

Obviously it was by word of mouth.\" \n \n A few days before Rogers' emails, Reedy Creek dispatcher Dan Lewis alerted Rogers and another official about a problem with the gators. \n \n \"Could yall tell the ops side to stop feeding these alligators, we think we have 2,\" Lewis wrote in an email. \"They are coming out in the parking lot much more than others in the past and WE are the ones who have to walk in that parking lot every day and in the dark. They are not docile gators, they are mean and they are out looking for food because people are feeding them. It's getting uncomfortable\" \n \n Classe said he doubts the larger gator would have been involved in the attack on Lane Graves. \"The gator would have to travel across a couple roadways \u2026 to get over to the Seven Seas water body system, so it's not likely\" it got over there, Classe said. \n \n There is a pond behind the fire station that does not appear connected to other waterways. \n \n Tim Stromsnes, president of the Reedy Creek firefighters' union, said he had heard in the past about a small alligator \u2014 about 4 feet \u2014 in that pond. \n \n \"I've never seen anybody or heard of anybody feeding it,\" he said. \"I think he's been in there forever in that little retention pond there.\" \n \n spedicini@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5240",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Firefighters at Disney World were warned to stop feeding alligators two months before a gator killed 2-year-old Lane Graves, according to employee emails. Emails from employees of Reedy Creek Emergency Services\u2014which operates inside the park\u2014show firefighters had been feeding at least one of two gators apparently living in a pond near their fire station, less than a mile from where Lane was killed, reports the Orlando Sentinel. One alligator was believed to be four or five feet long, and the other was a juvenile. In one email to the fire station's commanders, a communications rep said an alligator had been spotted near the station where communications staff parked their cars, and some \"expressed concern of becoming alligator food. ... (C)ould you ask your crews to stop feeding the gator.\" A Reedy Creek dispatcher later complained about two gators in the parking lot. \"They are not docile gators, they are mean and they are out looking for food because people are feeding them,\" he wrote. \"It's getting uncomfortable.\" A Reedy Creek district administrator says firefighters received \"just a talking to\"\u2014though feeding gators is illegal in Florida. It's not clear whether these gators have any connection to Lane's death. The administrator is skeptical because they would have had \"to travel across a couple roadways\" to get to the Seven Seas Lagoon near the Grand Floridian Resort & Spa, where the June 14 incident took place. Still, notes the Washington Post, trying to avoid such attacks is \"one reason it is illegal to feed alligators in Florida.\" The resort area has since added signs warning people about feeding them, reports People. (The June attack was the result of a \"perfect storm\" of circumstances.)",
    "generated_summary": "Two months after firefighters were admonished for feeding the animals, a gator \u2014 thought to be between four and seven feet long \u2014 fatally attacked a boy wading in the lagoon. It is not apparent if the firefighter feedings in the station pond, which is an isolated body of water, are connected to the June attack. In the wake of the tragedy, Disney installed warning signs about the presence of alligators and snakes, and removed crocodilian characters. Crocodilians, which include alligators, are instinctively wary of people. When people feed gators, however, they may lose their fear of humans and become aggressive.",

MegHasken22 Way better than the other moms. more ||||| At a glance, the two websites look virtually indistinguishable. Both feature a photo of Donald Trump, in a suit and red tie, in front of a giant American flag. Both seemingly offer a chance for two to win dinner with Donald Trump. \n \n One is at donaldjtrump.com; the other is at dinnerwithtrump.org. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n The first belongs to Trump\u2019s campaign. The second is a scheme run by Ian Hawes, a 25-year-old Maryland man who has no affiliation with Trump or his campaign and who has preyed on more than 20,000 unsuspecting donors, collecting more than $1 million in the process. \n \n In just its first three weeks of operation, Hawes\u2019 PAC spent more than $108,000 on Facebook ads, offering an opportunity to win \u201cDinner with Donald Trump\u201d \u2014 and netted itself nearly $350,000 in donations, according to federal records. \n \n The biggest chunk of the money raised \u2014 $133,000 \u2014 went to a company that Hawes founded and owns, CartSoft LLC. The purpose of the payments is described on federal records as \u201cmedia\u201d and \u201cmedia purchasing,\u201d though CartSoft\u2019s website describes itself as an online payment-processing platform. \n \n Since its launch, the PAC has collected more than $1 million, Hawes told POLITICO. It has reportedly spent $0 on behalf of Trump. \n \n \u201cI feel ripped off and taken advantage of. This is horrible. That was not my intent,\u201d said Mary Pat Kulina, who owns a paper-shredding company in Maryland and gave $265 to Hawes\u2019 group. Kulina thought she had given to Trump\u2019s campaign until told otherwise by POLITICO. \u201cThis is robbery,\u201d she said. \u201cI want my money back and I want them to add up what they stole from people and give it to Donald Trump.\u201d \n \n Of the 156 donors who gave more than $200 to Hawes\u2019 group in June \u2014 the threshold for names to be included in federal filings \u2014 POLITICO contacted dozens and spoke with 11. Everyone interviewed said they believed they had given to Trump\u2019s campaign, not an unconnected PAC. \n \n \u201cI would say, unfortunately, that\u2019s simply a matter of pure chance,\u201d Hawes said in an interview defending his group and denying it is a scam. \n \n Hours after POLITICO published this story, Trump\u2019s campaign sent a letter to Hawes accusing him of \u201cdefrauding\u201d his donors and asking him to cease-and-desist. \n \n But the dinner scheme is just the beginning. By late July, Hawes \u2014 who in his Twitter bio calls himself a \u201cregistered genius, board certified hacker, and grape soda connoisseur\u201d \u2014 had launched another website, crookedhillary2016.org, according to Internet domain registration records, and began promoting a contest to revoke her security clearance. The group\u2019s Facebook page copies the \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d logo that is used on Trump\u2019s official LyingCrookedHillary.com site. \n \n \u201cWe're raising $1 million dollars from small donors to fight Crooked Hillary's campaign of lies,\u201d reads Hawes\u2019 site. Hawes also registered imwithtrump.org in late June, records show, though that site remains dormant. \n \n As of Sunday, Hawes\u2019 group had raised $1.1 million from 21,253 donors, he said. More than 410,000 people had signed up for the dinner contest \u2014 giving him a massive email list he can leverage for more money for years to come. \n \n Internet-based scam PACs are hardly new to 2016. In the past, some have made look-alike campaign sites and bought Google ads to lure unsuspecting donors. Facebook, with its vast audience and ability to target users by political ideology, has proved an alluring tool this cycle, and Trump, with legions of passionate fans, has become an appealing target. Facebook declined to comment for this story. \n \n Because Hawes\u2019 PAC has zero ties to Trump\u2019s campaign, the dinner it is dangling won\u2019t be very intimate. The fine print \u2014 in gray, size 8.5-font on a black background at the bottom of the website \u2014 discloses that this \u201cdinner\u201d actually amounts to the PAC buying two tickets \u201cat a Sponsor-selected fundraising evening event held with Donald Trump and other attendees.\u201d \n \n David Easlick, a lawyer in Virginia, gave more than $1,000 to American Horizons PAC. \u201cI assumed it was coming from Trump and we donated $1,000 because you might have a better chance than if you\u2019d given $100,\u201d Easlick said. \n \n He asked with more than a hint of resignation, \u201cIs it a fraud or something?\u201d \n \n Hawes\u2019 site doesn\u2019t initially ask for money. First, one can enter the dinner contest simply by providing an email address. But it quickly offers a chance to \u201cdouble your chances\u201d by donating, even though the fine print states, \u201cContributing will not improve chances of winning.\u201d \n \n One person, Jared Peavler of Indiana, posted screenshots of his correspondence with Hawes\u2019 group on Facebook after he complained it was a scam. \u201cI\u2019d like to point out that it clearly states that contributing does NOT increase chances of winning both in the rules within the link and at the bottom of the email,\u201d Peavler wrote, adding in all-caps, \u201cEAT SHIT!\u201d \n \n An email signed by Hawes replied. \u201cMonetary contributions don\u2019t increase your chance of winning, but we do multiply your entries. We\u2019re also a political action committee, so it\u2019s our job to collect contributions. So you can eat your own shit.\u201d \n \n Peavler told POLITICO: \u201cThat was when I knew it was fake. Professionals don't allow themselves to be drawn into an unprofessional conversation like that.\u201d (Hawes said he did not recall writing such an email and that his records did not show any such correspondence. \u201cThat\u2019s not something we would say,\u201d he said. \u201cPissing people off is not something that we\u2019re trying to do.\u201d) \n \n Another donor, Jeanie Boro, an insurance broker in California, gave $1,015 to the group before she saw in the fine print that it wasn\u2019t actually affiliated with Trump. \u201cI thought it was very deceiving. I was very upset,\u201d Boro said. She demanded and received a refund. \n \n If people complain, Hawes said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be happy to return your donations right away.\u201d They had processed 110 refunds to date, he said. (Those who want their money back can email help@americanhorizons.org.) \n \n American Horizons PAC, which Hawes registered with the Federal Election Commission on June 10, is actually the second incarnation of a \u201cDinner with Donald Trump\u201d scheme \u2014 though both have ties to Hawes. \n \n The top screen, bearing the Trump-Pence logo, is the official campaign \"Dinner with Trump\" fundraising raffle. The bottom screen is from a scam PAC. | Screengrabs \n \n An earlier group called the Recover America PAC was created in late November and registered by Michael Williams, a friend of Hawes\u2019, who listed the same website \u2014 dinnerwithtrump.org \u2014 that the current dinner-promoting PAC is using. The contact number provided to the FEC on that filing was affiliated online with a company called Glexia, where both Williams (CEO and president) and Hawes (executive vice president) are listed as employees. That first effort, however, never reported any further activity, despite three subsequent letters from FEC attorneys demanding additional paperwork. \n \n Then, in June, Hawes revived the idea. The new PAC immediately began buying Facebook ads, starting with $750 per day on June 10 and building up to more than $15,000 on June 29. In three weeks, the group had raised $349,958. \n \n Hawes took advantage of a vacuum left by a skeletal Trump operation that had failed to activate supporters online and protect its digital turf; Hawes noted he bought Facebook ads and solicited money via email before Trump ever did, and created the dinner contest first. \n \n He said Trump\u2019s campaign has never contacted the PAC to request that it stop using his name, even though the campaign did so to the FEC last fall about some other groups. The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment for this story. \n \n \u201cI applaud anyone that wants to dig into our financials, but they\u2019re looking at the wrong political organization,\u201d Hawes said. \n \n So far, his group\u2019s biggest expenditure was to his company CartSoft. The next report is due in mid-October. Hawes declined to say what his personal cut has been. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t want to say the number is zero, because that\u2019s not true,\u201d he said, calling any CartSoft profits \u201ca standard mark-up.\u201d \n \n FEC commissioner Ann Ravel declined to discuss any specific potential cases but said that, in general, the FEC is too powerless when it comes to combating fraud. \n \n \u201cThat\u2019s the frustration I have, that there\u2019s very little recourse,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople give money thinking it\u2019s going to go to a particular person or a particular cause, and it\u2019s a consumer protection issue as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d \n \n John McQueen, a funeral home owner in Florida, remembered seeing the ad in his Facebook feed. \u201cI had planned to give a thousand bucks to his campaign, and when my wife saw it also on her Facebook feed she said, \u2018Why not do this?\u2019\u201d he recalled. \n \n He gave $1,015 in late June. \n \n \u201cWho really reads the fine print?\u201d he lamented. \u201cIf he wants to refund me my thousand bucks, I\u2019m happy to turn around and give it to Mr. Trump.\u201d \n \n Hawes\u2019 PAC ended June with $88,197 cash on hand. It is not clear what activities he has planned on Trump\u2019s behalf this fall. \u201cWe use the money that we collect in a way that we feel best creates value for the people who have donated to us,\u201d he said. \n \n Hawes\u2019 most recent activity online was posting publicly on his personal Facebook page that he got engaged in mid-August \u201con the bow of the yacht overlooking Miami.\u201d \n \n \u201cCouldn't be more perfect!\u201d he wrote, as he posted pictures of himself sipping champagne with his fianc\u00e9 and of her glittering oval engagement ring.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 More than $1 million has been raised in the name of Donald Trump by a PAC\u2014but zero dollars appear to have gone to help the GOP nominee, and donors are furious with the \"registered genius\" and \"grape soda connoisseur\" behind the setup, Politico reports. Ian Hawes is the 25-year-old behind dinnerwithtrump.org, a site not affiliated with Trump's campaign and that offers an exciting opportunity, if you're a Trump fan: a chance to win tickets to a Trump \"fundraising event,\" complete with flight and hotel stay. That contest site, in addition to other fundraising efforts Hawes has made\u2014including nearly $110,000 in Facebook ads, per federal records\u2014has so far brought in $1.1 million from more than 21,000 donors, Hawes says. The issue: Donors say they thought this fundraising effort was part of Trump's campaign, though the fine print on the site notes it's simply giving away two tickets to a \"Sponsor-selected fundraising evening event\" with Trump in attendance. \"I feel ripped off and taken advantage of. \u2026 This is robbery,\" says one donor who ponied up $256 to Hawes' American Horizons PAC, thinking she was donating directly to Trump's camp. Hawes denies he's pulling one over on anyone, noting that interested parties can enter the dinner contest without donating\u2014though Politico notes a \"double your chances\" promotion is offered via multiple entries if someone contributes\u2014and that the PAC will refund donations to anyone who asks for one. Plus, he adds, Trump's campaign has never told him to cease and desist using Trump's name. The \"dinner with the Donald\" site isn't Hawes' only moneymaker scheme: He's also launched crookedhillary2016.org\u2014\"to fight Crooked Hillary's campaign of lies\"\u2014and has registered imwithtrump.org, though that's not live yet.

    "document": "The Washington State man accused of killing three people at a party on Friday night with an AR-15 read the rifle's instruction manual just moments before opening fire, court records show. \n \n Allen Ivanov, 19, told detectives he bought the semi-automatic rifle a week ago for target practice and had even scheduled a safety class for August, according to a probable cause form released Monday. \n \n But Ivanov instead brought the gun with him to a party that his ex-girlfriend was attending in Mukilteo, a Seattle suburb, investigators say. \n \n Mukilteo shooting suspect Allen Ivanov made a brief first court appearance August 1, in Snohomish County. A judge ordered Ivanov be held without bail and that he have no contact with the victims' families.

It wasn't immediately clear if he had a lawyer. ||||| Allen Christopher Ivanov told detectives he viewed the AR-15 \u201cas a symbol of power,\u201d according to an affidavit of probable cause. \n \n EVERETT \u2014 After spotting his ex-girlfriend with another guy through the window of a Mukilteo house where a party was under way, Allen Christopher Ivanov returned to his car Friday night to study the owner\u2019s manual for his new AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, police wrote in court documents. \n \n Two hours apparently passed before Ivanov walked back to the home around 12:07 a.m., Saturday, opened fire and killed three young people, including his ex, and wounded a fourth, according to the affidavit of probable cause outlining the police case against the 19-year-old. \n \n Like Ivanov, all of the victims were recent graduates of Kamiak High School. \n \n On Monday, Snohomish County District Court Judge Anthony Howard affirmed a finding of probable cause to hold Ivanov on investigation of one count of aggravated first-degree-murder domestic violence, two counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted first-degree murder. On Sunday, a court commissioner had also found probable cause to hold Ivanov on the same allegations. \n \n Howard ordered Ivanov \u2014 who appeared via video feed from the Snohomish County Jail \u2014 to be held without bail. \n \n Prosecutors are expected to formally charge Ivanov on Tuesday or Wednesday, Deputy Prosecutor Adam Cornell said. \n \n Killed were Ivanov\u2019s ex-girlfriend, Anna Bui, Jake Long and Jordan Ebner, all 19. Will Kramer, 18, was wounded and was in serious condition Monday in the intensive-care unit at Harborview Medical Center, a hospital spokesman said. \n \n Also Monday, a vigil was held for Bui at the University of Washington\u2019s Bothell campus, where she and Ivanov were students. Recently returned from a monthlong trip to Europe, Bui was remembered as a \u201cbright light\u201d who was considering a career in medicine. \n \n The mass shooting has rocked a tight-knit group of friends who attended Mukilteo\u2019s Kamiak High School. \n \n Sultan Akbar, 18, had classes with Ivanov and the victims. He wasn\u2019t at the party where the shootings happened, but showed up at court with three friends Monday to express support for the victims\u2019 families. \n \n \u201cI just feel shook up,\u201d Akbar said. \u201cI\u2019m shocked \u2026 those guys aren\u2019t here anymore.\u201d \n \n He was friends with Ivanov, who he said seemed to have an explosive temper, once threatening to get Akbar kicked out of school after Akbar reported to a teacher that Ivanov had copied his work. \n \n \u201cHe was always wanting to be in control of the situation\u201d and at times displayed \u201cillogical anger,\u201d Akbar said. \n \n Seattle defense attorneys Tim Leary and Zach Wagnild were retained by Ivanov\u2019s parents over the weekend and said the couple are devastated for the victims\u2019 families as well as their own. Ivanov\u2019s mother told them Bui \u201cwas essentially like a daughter to them,\u201d Wagnild said. \n \n Leary said he was troubled that Ivanov was able to buy an assault-style rifle but was too young to buy a six-pack of beer. He underscored the police contention that Ivanov read the weapon\u2019s instruction manual just before the shooting. \n \n \u201cI think it speaks volumes to his youth and inexperience and highlights the lethality of the weapon involved,\u201d Leary said. \n \n Mukilteo police say Ivanov told detectives he broke up with Bui two months ago but then decided he wanted her back, according to the affidavit. He told police he began spending time with Bui last week. \n \n After his arrest, \u201cIvanov stated that everything that went on tonight was about a girl,\u201d police wrote in the affidavit. \n \n Ivanov became jealous after he said he saw photos of Bui on Snapchat with other young men \u2014 evidence \u201cshe was getting on with her life without him,\u201d the document says. He told police he realized she was his \u201cdream girl,\u201d \u201cand wanted to get back together,\u201d the affidavit says. \n \n Ivanov said he became angry when he heard from others that Bui \u201cwas seeing other guys while the two of them were talking and that made him angry,\u201d police wrote. \n \n The affidavit says Ivanov claimed he purchased the Ruger AR-15 rifle about a week ago, intent on using it for target practice. He signed up for a firearms-safety class, which was to begin early this month. \n \n He told police he viewed \u201cthe rifle as a symbol of power,\u201d the affidavit said. \n \n On Friday night, Ivanov left work early because he \u201cwasn\u2019t feeling well,\u201d then went to the Cabela\u2019s store in Marysville to buy a second magazine for the rifle because he had been told he would need it for the firearms class, the affidavit says. \n \n Ivanov told police he arrived at the party in the 10000 block of 64th Place West at 10 p.m. Friday but parked across the street and watched the house, the affidavit says. He crept up toward the house, looked inside and saw Bui \u201cwith another male and got angry,\u201d it says. \n \n Ivanov then returned to his car, where he read the owner\u2019s manual for the rifle, loaded the magazine and inserted it into the AR-15, the affidavit says. \n \n Around midnight, he crept to the back of the house, hiding \u201calong the west wall near the living room windows,\u201d it says. He was discovered by a male partygoer, who said, \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d before Ivanov opened fire, shooting the male, according to the affidavit. \n \n Ivanov told police \u201cit was too late to turn back, and once he had pulled the trigger, his adrenaline kicked in.\u201d He entered the house through a side door, found Bui and shot her twice, it says. He continued through the house, then shot another male \u201crunning toward the house,\u201d police wrote. \n \n Ivanov went upstairs and onto the balcony off the master bedroom and fired at two more males in the driveway, police wrote. \u201cHe then went up on the roof and realized his magazine was empty,\u201d so returned to his car and drove away. He was arrested about 90 minutes later on Interstate 5 near Chehalis. \n \n As part of the investigation into the killings, a detective spoke by phone with a person described as a \u201cwitness from Kentucky,\u201d who said that two or three days earlier, Ivanov had sent him text messages \u201cregarding committing a mass shooting,\u201d the affidavit says. \n \n Detectives say Ivanov\u2019s recent social-media posts suggest he \u201cwas considering the murders \u2026 he later committed.\u201d \n \n Vicki Bratvold, whose teenage son hosted the house party where the shootings occurred, texted a Seattle Times reporter Monday, writing \u201cthere are no words to express our sorrow.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe have always tried to make our house a loving, safe, happy place that the kids could always come. Our hearts are broken for the parents of Jake, Anna, and Jordan. We are praying for Will\u2019s recovery,\u201d she wrote. ||||| EVERETT, Wash. -- Allen Ivanov, the 19-year-old accused in the mass shooting in Mukilteo, said that it was about his \"dream girl,\" court documents say. \n \n The documents, written by Mukilteo police Detective John Ernst, say Ivanov crept outside the home in the Chennault Beach neighborhood with an AR-15 rifle he had bought a week earlier. The rifle was so new that he had to read its instruction manual to operate it as he sat in his car outside the home where a party was going on. \n \n As he was hiding outside the home, a male who was at the party discovered him, Ivanov told police. \"No, no,\" the party goer said. \n \n He told police he was scared and opened fire. \"He stated at that point that it was too late to turn back, and once he had pulled the trigger his adrenaline kicked in,\" Ernst wrote. \n \n Ivanov went into the house and found his former girlfriend, Anna Bui, and shot her twice, court documents say. \n \n He saw a male running toward the house and shot him. He went to a balcony off the master bedroom and shot two more males, court documents say. Ivanov went to the roof, but realized that he was out of ammunition. \n \n Ivanov returned to his car. \n \n He had another magazine in his car. He had bought it hours earlier after he left his job at the Apple Store at Alderwood Mall. He said he was sick. \n \n Ivanov said he was loading the magazine in the call and intended to go back into the party and use the AR-15 rifle more. Instead, he drove away. \n \n In addition to Bui, Jordan Ebner, and Jake Long were also killed. All were 19. A fourth shooting victim, identified by friends as Will Kramer, is at Harborview Medical Center. \n \n His lawyers expected charges to be Tuesday and say it could be a capital case in which the death penalty could be a punishment option. At a brief court hearing Monday afternoon, he was ordered to be held without bail and to have no contact with the families of the victims. \n \n The documents portray a distraught Ivanov who was jealous that Bui had moved on with her life and had begun dating other men. \n \n Ivanov, questioned by police after he had been arrested in Chehalis on Saturday morning, told investigators that he had broken up with Bui two months earlier, but realized it had been a mistake. He wanted to resume his relationship with her. \n \n She was the first girl he had kissed, he told police. \n \n He told police that he bought the rifle the week before for target practice and intended to take gun-safety classes. He told police that he saw the gun \"as a symbol of power.\" \n \n \n \n \"He was a nice guy when I knew him. Nice guy, funny guy. Hyper guy. He got excited, like happy,\" said Sultan Akbar, a high school friend who last spoke to Ivanov on graduation day in 2015. \"On some situations, he did get extremely, profusely angry.\" \n \n \"It\u2019s just shocking, shocking that he did it and they\u2019re not here anymore,\" Akbar added. \n \n Police report that someone from Kentucky told officers that Ivanov had sent him text messages about committing a mass shooting. \n \n Ivanov's attorneys told KOMO News' Jennifer Sullivan on Monday that Ivanov's family is grief-stricken. He is their only child, and they considered Bui a daughter. \n \n \n \n Ivanov is \"very quiet .. he's having some trouble right now,\" said one of the lawyers, Zachary Wagnild. \n \n \u201cThey obviously didn\u2019t see this coming and are grieving along with many others in this community over what happened,\u201d said Tim Leary, who is also representing Ivanov. \n \n \n \n Ivanov, who is being held for investigation of three counts of first degree murder, including one count of aggravated first degree murder, and a fourth count of attempted murder made his first court appearance by video link Monday from the Snohomish County Jail. Prosecutors asked Ivanov be held without bail, and the judge agreed. Ivanov is also barred from having contact with any victims or their families. \n \n On Monday KOMO News obtained a note that Ivanov's former attorney says was written by the suspect and given to him by Ivanov's mother. It contains messages to family and friends, including several that mention \"the next life.\" \n \n \n \n Prosecutors have until Wednesday to file formal charges and Ivanov's formal arraignment has not yet been scheduled.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The teenager accused of killing three people at a house party near Seattle bought his AR-15-style rifle so recently he had to study the instruction manual before the rampage, police say. According to court documents, 19-year-old Allen Ivanov has told police that he bought the Ruger firearm just a week ago and carried out the shooting because he was angry that the \"dream girl\" he split up with two months ago didn't want to get back together with him, NBC News reports. Investigators say Ivanov has told them that on Friday night, he bought another magazine for the gun after leaving his job at an Apple Store early. He drove to the party in the suburb of Mukilteo around 10pm and looked through a window. After spotting his ex with another man, he returned to the car to study the rifle's instructions. Around midnight, he allegedly returned to the party and opened fire. Cops say Ivanov killed his ex-girlfriend, Anna Bui, as well as partygoers Jake Long and Jordan Ebner, all 19 years old. An 18-year-old victim was seriously injured. Ivanov, who fled after the shooting and was arrested more than 100 miles away, is being held without bail on charges including first-degree murder, KOMO reports. Investigators say the teen's recent posts on social media suggest the murders were planned. Tim Leary, a lawyer hired by his parents, tells the Seattle Times it worries him that Ivanov could buy the AR-15 when he is too young to buy beer. The fact that he had to read the manual \"speaks volumes to his youth and inexperience and highlights the lethality of the weapon involved,\" he says. (The family of the AR-15's inventor says he'd be \"sickened\" by his gun's use.)",

    "document": "It focuses on a notorious act of white police brutality against mostly Black citizens, in a July 1967, siege at the Motor City\u2019s Algiers Motel, where racism met frustration and blood was wantonly shed. Three young Black men were left dead and many questions were left unanswered. The mostly white Detroit Police Department emerged officially exonerated but not blameless. \n \n The incident is set against the larger story of the Detroit riots of the same year, which left 43 people dead, nearly 1,200 injured and 7,200 arrested, as the National Guard along with city and state police combined to enforce law and order in a city literally burning from racial tensions. \n \n No one would accuse the cops in Detroit of being \u201ctoo nice,\u201d although Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal \u2014 who previously teamed for Zero Dark Thirty and Oscar-winning The Hurt Locker \u2014 are careful not to demonize every authority figure. Many of the police and soldiers in the film are appalled by the acts of racism and violence they\u2019re witnessing, among them the commanding officer of trigger-happy young patrol officer Philip Krauss, who is played by cherry-cheeked Will Poulter (The Revenant). \n \n Despite civil-rights advances and eight years of an African-American U.S. president, the colour of a person\u2019s skin can still determine everything from employment opportunities to treatment by police \u2014 who were recently encouraged by President Donald Trump to \u201cplease don\u2019t be too nice\u201d when dealing with crime suspects, wink, wink. \n \n The injustice and anger behind it all feels like current reality, even a half-century on, making Detroit urgent viewing regardless of its character-development flaws. \n \n Being appalled, however, isn\u2019t the same as taking full ownership. The commander severely reprimands Krauss for fatally shooting a fleeing looter. He then allows the unrepentant patrolman to return to the streets. \n \n Krauss later becomes the central antagonist of the Algiers Motel siege, which is sparked by a teen\u2019s reckless firing of a starter\u2019s pistol at a passing group of National Guardsmen. As cops and soldiers converge on the seedy establishment, seeking the sniper they believe hides inside, fate has also drawn in multiple unlucky bystanders, who thought they\u2019d escaped the riots. \n \n Among them are rising R&B singer Larry Reed (Algee Smith) and his friend Fred Simple (Jacob Latimore); private security guard Melvin Dismukes (John Boyega); a Vietnam vet named Greene (Anthony Mackie); and two white visitors from Ohio (Hannah Murray and Kaitlyn Dever), who picked a bad time and place to party. \n \n That\u2019s a lot of characters, and there are more, and here you have the central deficiency of Boal\u2019s script: it tries to tell us everything about the circumstances without telling us much about the people. The film is less a character study and more of a situational one; a post-script notes that the Algiers Motel incident has never been fully explained. \n \n Detroit opens with a roughly animated history lesson about how poor southern Blacks moved to white-dominated northern cities while affluent whites fled to the suburbs, taking the best jobs with them. The resulting powder keg of inequities exploded not just in Detroit, but across America. \n \n And it led to situations like the motel standoff, which Bigelow and cinematographer Barry Ackroyd powerfully depict cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 style as a cascading series of bad choices, evil intentions and escalating violence. \n \n Krauss and his fellow racist cops torture the rounded-up motel guests by beating them and threatening to shoot them one by one until the identity of the alleged sniper is disclosed. \n \n Watching it unfold over the bulk of the film\u2019s 143-minute running time makes for a grim sit, made all the more so by James Newton Howard\u2019s minimalist score, which at times disappears altogether. Bigelow deserves credit for not trivializing the drama with a soundtrack packed with driving Motown tunes, although a version of Martha and the Vandellas\u2019 \u201cNowhere To Run\u201d is briefly heard in the film at one point. \n \n You don\u2019t need a big backbeat to drive images like these home; Detroit\u2019s deep fury and essential message sears the eye and brain. ||||| There is no nice or pretty way to tell a story about the systemic oppression and mistreatment of black people in the United States. It's fitting then that Kathryn Bigelow's \" Detroit ,\" an account of the murders of three unarmed black men that took place in the Algiers Motel in late July 1967, is neither \u2014 it is an all-out assault on your senses and soul. \n \n It's hard to overstate just how visceral and harrowing an experience it is. \"Detroit\" is a well-made and evocative film that is also numbingly brutal with little to no reprieve. And while it might be the only true way to tell this story, it's also one that is not going to be for everyone. The stomach-churning horror begins immediately and does not let up for 2 hours and 23 minutes. \n \n To set the stage for the Algiers Motel, Bigelow begins by speeding through the history of black people in United States with animated acrylics and pounding music \u2014 emancipation, the great migration, white flight and the racist zoning practices that led to the overcrowding of black residents in urban pockets. Tensions have already reached a tipping point, and then in the summer of 1967, Detroit police bust an after-hours club in what would become the inciting incident for the riots. \n \n Three days after the riots begin, a local singing group called The Dramatics are about to go on stage at a big, crowded theater hoping to get their big break, but are interrupted and sent home due to the events outside. The men exit the theater in their sparkly suits into what looks like a war zone. As they run through the streets they assure every cop who isn't already beating someone with a night stick that they're just on their way home. Bigelow shows all of this with handheld, ground level docudrama realism. There is no orienting yourself to the bigger picture, only what is right in front of you. \n \n The charismatic lead singer Larry (Algee Smith) and his buddy Fred (Jacob Latimore) decide to peel off and get an $11 room at the Algiers and wait out the night. There they meet two white party girls, a veteran, Greene (a terrific Anthony Mackie), and a provocateur, Carl (Jason Mitchell), who plays around with a starter pistol that eventually catches the attention of the police in the area. The officers, who we've already learned are rotten, storm the motel on the hunt for the sniper they presume is there. \n \n The local police, led by a maniacal, hotheaded racist, Krauss (played by the English actor Will Poulter), kills Carl immediately and then continue to terrorize the guests relentlessly with inhuman torture tactics in what seems like an endless sequence of horror upon horror until two more end up dead and they call it a night. \n \n Bigelow collaborated again with screenwriter Mark Boal on \"Detroit,\" which is perfectly evocative of this specific time and place, but lacking the perspective and illumination that one might hope a 50-year-old event would warrant. Perhaps they wanted to leave conclusions and interpreting to the audience, and as the film notes at the end, no one knows for certain what happened in the Algiers Motel and some of the scenes were pieced together and imagined by the filmmakers. \n \n There is some nuance \u2014 in the National Guard officer who is horrified by the situation and the local security officer (John Boyega) who only wanted to ease tensions \u2014 but not nearly as much as Bigelow and Boal have previously achieved in \"Zero Dark Thirty\" and \"The Hurt Locker.\" \n \n Also very little insight is given to the victims' lives outside of this event. Maybe that's not the point, though. Maybe anger is all you're supposed to feel when you step outside the theater. Maybe not feeling satisfied with \"Detroit\" is the point. \n \n This was America, you think. This is still America. And the movies can't offer a resolution that history hasn't. \n \n \"Detroit,\" an Annapurna Pictures release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for \"strong violence and pervasive language.\" Running time: 143 minutes. Three stars out of four. \n \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \n MPAA Definition of R: Restricted.

Inspired in part by the 1992 Los Angeles riots \u2014 which were sparked by the acquittal of the LAPD officers who'd beaten Rodney King near to death \u2014 the movie's plot involved the murder of black hip-hop artist \"Jeriko One\" by a pair of white Los Angeles cops. \n \n As ambitious as it was unwieldy, Strange Days flopped so hard that Bigelow's career took years to recover. But she landed on her feet, becoming the first and so far only woman to win the Academy Award for best director, for the Iraq war movie The Hurt Locker, which also won best picture. Her follow-up, Zero Dark Thirty, got a Best Picture nod, too. And that's how a sexagenarian woman in Hollywood earns the juice to make a movie like the incendiary new Detroit \u2014 Bigelow's vivid, inevitably divisive reenactment of a real 1967 incident wherein three Motor City police officers were charged in the killings of three adolescent black men while the city was under martial law following riots. \n \n Seemingly in a position to make any movie she wanted, she chose a lightly fictionalized historical drama that bares a striking resemblance to her little-seen Angela Bassett-starring sci-fi flick from 1995. (Strange Days even climaxes in a riot touched off by white police using excessive force on a black suspect, which is where Detroit begins.) \n \n Until now, the highest-profile accounting of what happened that night was John Hersey's 1968 book The Algiers Motel Incident. (Hersey's estate declined to sell Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal the rights, The New York Times reported.) Detroit isn't as dispassionate as that. Just as the movie Hidden Figures buffed and polished the story told in the eponymous nonfiction book for maximum uplift, Detroit heats and sharpens the facts that formed it for maximum outrage. \n \n Not that those facts weren't outrageous already: In the case Detroit revisits, the cops were acquitted after the confessions they gave and then recanted were ruled inadmissible in court. That's a cruel irony, because it was in their attempt to coerce confessions from the young men they'd confined in Detroit's Algiers Motel \u2014 a $6-a-night flophouse that the law considered a den of sin \u2014that those out-of-control cops resorted to intimidation, torture, and finally murder. (The presence of two white girls from Ohio among all those black men appeared to inflame the cops' further \u2014 they accused the women of prostitution, stripping and beating them.) The police claimed a sniper had fired upon them from inside the motel, but they never recovered a rifle from the scene. Detroit subscribes to accounts from several witnesses that the shots that summoned the police came from a starter pistol fired first as a stupid prank, then as an impotent and costly gesture of defiance. Carl Cooper, the 17-year-old who'd allegedly fired it, was the first to die that night. \n \n One of the witnesses who testified for the prosecution, and who said he was assaulted by the accused policemen himself at the Algiers, was a musician. Singer Larry Reed quit his vocal group The Dramatics after that hellish night in 1967; the group broke out a few years later and had a long career without him. (They're still touring.) Reed was one of the incident's key figures that frequent Bigelow collaborator Boal interviewed while working on the movie. And though Boal's research team included Pulitzer Prize-winning Detroit Free Press reporter David Zeman, he has used his artistic license to plug some gaps in the legal record. (Other limits on the film's authenticity were merely budgetary, like the fact that tax incentives resulted in most of Detroit being filmed on location in... Boston.) \n \n Boal's script commingles real and fictional people: Real-life witnesses Melvin Dismukes, Julie Hysell, and Larry Reed (played onscreen by John Boyega, Hannah Murray, and Algee Smith, respectively), are represented, but the brutal cops in the movie have different names than the officers who were eventually acquitted of the Algiers Motel killings. Their ringleader is played by Will Poulter, a redheaded, freckled 24-year-old English actor whose permanently right-angled eyebrows make him look like the satanic cousin of MAD magazine mascot Alfred E. Neuman. \"We've failed these people,\" he says early in the film, sounding like a peace-loving Hubert Humphrey voter moments before he fatally shoots one of \"these people\" in the back on suspicion of stealing groceries. A detective tells him he's recommending that the District Attorney file murder charges against him, but Poulter's character is sent right back out to active duty in the meantime. Did this really happen? Well, there was a riot on. \n \n Other credulity-straining aspects of Detroit appear to be factual: For one thing, Dismukes, a private security guard called in to protect a store near the Algiers from looters, was allowed to enter the Algiers with a weird coalition of Detroit cops and National Guardsmen and remain at a crime scene for hours while trying, ineffectually, to prevent the cops from brutalizing their suspects. (Boyega radiates Denzel-like calm in the face of the storm, proving that the way he livened the The Force Awakens was no fluke \u2014 he's a bonafide movie star. And to see him in a role where he's essentially helpless is unusual, and compelling.) In real life, Dismukes was charged with the felonious assault of two of the suspects and tried before any of the three cops accused of more serious offenses were; an all-white jury acquitted him. To the extent Detroit addresses this, it implies an unsuccessful attempt by the police to frame Dismukes for their own wrongdoing. \n \n I'm also curious to know whether another one of its plot points is historical or invented: When Michigan State Police arrive at the Algiers, the ranking officer among them decides he wants no part of the \"civil rights mix-up\" the Detroit P.D. has already created, so the state troopers just drive away. What's the expression? Huge if true. \n \n Bigelow and Boal's recreation of a 50-year-old police brutality case seems bound to be as controversial as their last project, 2012's Zero Dark Thirty. Accused in some quarters of defending the C.I.A.'s use of torture in its decade-long hunt for Osama Bin Laden, Zero Dark Thirty was really more of a high-tone Rorshach blot for each viewer's opinion of the endless War on Terror. Bigelow has always gone for immersion before reflection or judgment. \n \n \"I don't think it's up to the filmmaker to judge,\" the director told Washington Post chief film critic Ann Hornaday in a profile published last week. And it's not as though she's only just become interested in identity politics or policing: Long before her metamorphosis into an Oscar-winning maker of Important Films, she made 1990's Blue Steel, a sordid thriller that starred Jamie Lee Curtis as a rookie patrol officer who comes under suspicion after she kills a robbery suspect whose weapon can't be found. It's not a particularly good movie, nor one that would remotely satisfy any 2017 test of its wokeness, but it is at least more evidence that Bigelow was thinking about the problems of policing even when she was just making pulp films. \n \n Bigelow's quasi-journalistic style has long alienated some viewers; now it's infuriating them, too. Chicago critic Angelica Jade Bastien slammed Detroit as \"soulless,\" claiming it isn't harsh enough in its condemnation of the misconduct it depicts so mercilessly. Some of her specific complaints about Boal's screenplay \u2014 that it makes Melvin Dismukes \"too passive a character,\" or that \"there are also brief, disconcerting moments that present some white cops in a great light\" \u2014 come from the moments where Boal hews closest to the firsthand accounts Dismukes and Reed shared with him. Dismukes says he did all he could to prevent the bloodshed, which wasn't much, and Reed says that after he fled the Algiers he was picked up and taken to the hospital by a cop\u2014one who wasn't involved in the nightmare at the hotel. Molding facts into the emotional construct we refer to when use the word story is messy work, even when it's done in good faith. \n \n I've seen Detroit only once, but I'm of the option that Bigelow and Boal have done that good but messy work, resulting in a movie that is maddeningly imperfect but still honorable. The movie opens with a semi-animated sequence that fashions Jacob Lawrence's \"Migration Series\" of paintings into a primer on the mass movement of African-Americans from the rural south to the urban north and west after World War I, and the subsequent white flight to the suburbs. That meant that by the 1960s, Detroit was a majority-black city with a majority-white police force. \n \n It's to Bigelow's credit that she doesn't survey the worlds in which she sets her movies in schematic screenwriting terms: Detroit's early scenes, wherein a police raid on an unlicensed nightclub that's hosting a party for returning veterans sparks a riot, includes a few left turns \u2014 one of the black party guests who mouths off to the \"pigs\" turns out to be a narc, for example. This detail serves no narrative purpose; it only serves to underscore the absence of trust between the police and the citizens they're sworn to protect and serve. Editor Billy Goldenberg splices in documentary footage with the newly-shot material in this section of the movie, creating a panorama of the climate of mortal fear and volcanic anger between the citizens and the police. \n \n We begin to get our bearings when Reed (Algee Smith) and The Dramatics prepare to perform on a revue at the Fox Theatre where they know a Motown A&R; scout will be in the audience. When the police order the performance stopped and the Fox evacuated, and then their bus home is set upon by rioters, Reed and his friend Fred Temple (Jacob Latimore) make the ill-fated decision to wait out the curfew poolside at the Algiers. \n \n The police occupation of the Algiers forms the film's harrowing, quite long centerpiece. Bigelow uses all her gifts as a communicator of visceral sensation to summon the horror of spending a night under these vicious cops' bootheels. It's nauseating. By the time Anthony Mackie \u2014 playing an out-of-work Vietnam vet who gets thanked for his service by being beaten and spat on by cops \u2014 agrees never to speak of what he's witnessed, Bigelow and Boal have said all they have to say. \n \n But Detroit continues on to depict the trial of the three officers, leaking tension as it does. If the intent of this section of the film is to illustrate that these cops are not bad apples but rather the functioning-as-designed armature of an inherently racist justice system, it's only partially successful. The tactics their lawyer (John Krasinski, weirdly) uses to discredit the prosecution's witnesses are as familiar as the Algiers scenes are revolting, and our rage circuits have already blown. \n \n Maybe it's just impossible for even a scene-setter as skilled as Bigelow to do anything new in a courtroom. The coda she chooses, showing Larry Reed's resolution to continue his musical career in a far more modest fashion than before, has nothing to do with consoling the audience after 135 minutes of trauma. It's about Reed becoming a militant for peace. It's about him making a choice to survive. If nothing else, Detroit gets you thinking about how those might be the same thing. ||||| \u00d7 Close What is the Tomatometer\u00ae? \n \n The Tomatometer score \u2014 based on the opinions of hundreds of film and television critics \u2014 is a trusted measurement of critical recommendation for millions of fans.

    "document": "Original Contribution \n \n JAMA. doi: 10.1001/jama.2011.90 \n \n Axillary Dissection vs No Axillary Dissection in Women With Invasive Breast Cancer and Sentinel Node Metastasis \n \n A Randomized Clinical Trial \n \n Next Section Abstract Context Sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) accurately identifies nodal metastasis of early breast cancer, but it is not clear whether further nodal dissection affects survival. Objective To determine the effects of complete axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) on survival of patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis of breast cancer. Design, Setting, and Patients The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 trial, a phase 3 noninferiority trial conducted at 115 sites and enrolling patients from May 1999 to December 2004. Patients were women with clinical T1-T2 invasive breast cancer, no palpable adenopathy, and 1 to 2 SLNs containing metastases identified by frozen section, touch preparation, or hematoxylin-eosin staining on permanent section. Targeted enrollment was 1900 women with final analysis after 500 deaths, but the trial closed early because mortality rate was lower than expected. Interventions All patients underwent lumpectomy and tangential whole-breast irradiation. Those with SLN metastases identified by SLND were randomized to undergo ALND or no further axillary treatment. Those randomized to ALND underwent dissection of 10 or more nodes. Systemic therapy was at the discretion of the treating physician. Main Outcome Measures Overall survival was the primary end point, with a noninferiority margin of a 1-sided hazard ratio of less than 1.3 indicating that SLND alone is noninferior to ALND. Disease-free survival was a secondary end point. Results Clinical and tumor characteristics were similar between 445 patients randomized to ALND and 446 randomized to SLND alone. However, the median number of nodes removed was 17 with ALND and 2 with SLND alone. At a median follow-up of 6.3 years (last follow-up, March 4, 2010), 5-year overall survival was 91.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 89.1%-94.5%) with ALND and 92.5% (95% CI, 90.0%-95.1%) with SLND alone; 5-year disease-free survival was 82.2% (95% CI, 78.3%-86.3%) with ALND and 83.9% (95% CI, 80.2%-87.9%) with SLND alone. The hazard ratio for treatment-related overall survival was 0.79 (90% CI, 0.56-1.11) without adjustment and 0.87 (90% CI, 0.62-1.23) after adjusting for age and adjuvant therapy. Conclusion Among patients with limited SLN metastatic breast cancer treated with breast conservation and systemic therapy, the use of SLND alone compared with ALND did not result in inferior survival. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00003855 \n \n Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) has been part of breast cancer surgery since the description of the radical mastectomy.1 ALND reliably identifies nodal metastases and maintains regional control,2,3 but the contribution of local therapy to breast cancer survival is controversial.4,5 The Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group synthesized findings from 78 randomized controlled trials, concluding that local control of breast cancer was associated with improved disease-specific survival.6 \n \n ALND, as a means for achieving local disease control, carries an indisputable and often unacceptable risk of complications such as seroma, infection, and lymphedema.7,8,9 Sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) was therefore developed to accurately stage tumor-draining axillary nodes with less morbidity than ALND.10 SLND alone is the accepted management for patients whose sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) are histologically free of tumor, while ALND remains the standard of care for patients whose SLNs contain metastases.11 \n \n Cancer biology is much better understood now than it was when ALND was introduced. Biological factors may affect the predilection of some malignant cells to selectively invade lymph nodes rather than visceral organs, just as certain tumor types metastasize to certain organs and not others.12 Recognition of the complexity of tumor biology has changed cancer treatment, with more liberal use of systemic therapy to treat occult cancer cells wherever they may be in the body. Consequently, the decision to administer systemic therapy is influenced by a variety of patient- and tumor-related factors, with lymph node tumor status influencing13,14 but not necessarily dictating the use of chemotherapy.15,16,17,18 Other factors, such as early cancer detection by screening mammography, have led to earlier intervention in breast cancer, reducing the incidence of nodal metastases and even the number of tumor-involved lymph nodes.19 \n \n These evolving concepts have called into question the need for ALND.20,21 A variety of algorithms have been developed to help clinicians decide which patients would benefit from ALND.22,23,24 Review of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data has shown that the use of ALND for SLN metastases has decreased in recent years.25 No study has conclusively demonstrated a survival benefit or detriment for omitting ALND when metastatic breast cancer is identified by SLND. In the late 1990s, the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group designed and began the multicenter Z0011 trial. The primary aim of this study was to determine the effects of ALND on overall survival in patients with SLN metastases treated in the contemporary era with lumpectomy, adjuvant systemic therapy, and tangential-field radiation therapy. \n \n Previous Section Next Section METHODS Patient Characteristics This multicenter, randomized phase 3 trial was registered with the National Cancer Institute and approved by the institutional review boards of participating centers. All patients provided written informed consent. Adult women with histologically confirmed invasive breast carcinoma clinically 5 cm or less, no palpable adenopathy, and an SLN containing metastatic breast cancer documented by frozen section, touch preparation, or hematoxylin-eosin staining on permanent section were eligible for participation. Patients with metastases identified initially or solely with immunohistochemical staining were ineligible. Treatment with lumpectomy to negative margins (no tumor at ink) was required. Women were ineligible if they had 3 or more positive SLNs, matted nodes, or gross extranodal disease, or if they had received neoadjuvant hormonal therapy or chemotherapy. Study Design and Treatment Before randomization, all women underwent SLND and were stratified according to age (\u226450 and >50 years), estrogen-receptor status, and tumor size (\u22641 cm, >1 cm and \u22642 cm, or >2 cm). Eligible women were randomly assigned to ALND or no further axillary-specific intervention\u2014specifically, no third-field nodal irradiation. ALND was defined as an anatomical level I and II dissection including at least 10 nodes. All women were to receive whole-breast opposing tangential-field radiation therapy. The use of adjuvant systemic therapy was determined by the treating physician and was not specified in the protocol. Patients most commonly entered the study post-SLND following identification of metastases on final pathology report. However, of the 891 registered patients, 287 were registered pre-SLND and assigned to treatment after intraoperative documentation of SLN metastases. Patients in this group subsequently found to have 3 or more tumor-involved lymph nodes were included in the analysis. Patients were assessed for disease recurrence according to standard clinical practice. History and physical examination were performed every 6 months for the first 36 months and yearly thereafter. Annual mammography was required; other testing was based on symptoms and investigator preference. Study End Points The primary end point was overall survival, defined as the time from randomization until death from any cause. A short-term primary end point was occurrence of surgical morbidities. The study plan was to report surgical morbidities following the completion of accrual and prior to overall survival reporting after receiving permission from the data and safety monitoring committee. These morbidities have been reported.10 A secondary end point was disease-free survival, defined as the time from randomization to death or first documented recurrence of breast cancer. Breast cancer recurrence was categorized as locoregional disease (tumor in the breast or ipsilateral supraclavicular, subclavicular, internal mammary, or axillary nodes) or distant metastases. Disease-free survival and its components (locoregional disease and distant metastases) are reported instead of the protocol-specified secondary end point (eg, distant disease\u2013free survival) to facilitate comparison with other studies. Statistical Analysis The primary end point was overall survival as a measure of noninferiority of no further axillary specified interventions (SLND-alone group) compared with the ALND group. Based on the literature at the time of study design, we hypothesized that overall survival was 80% at 5 years for optimally treated women with positive nodes.26,27,28 Clinical noninferiority was defined as the SLND-alone group having a 5-year survival of not less than 75% of that observed in the ALND group. Noninferiority of the SLND-alone treatment was also considered if the hazard ratio (HR) for mortality was less than 1.3 when compared with ALND. An estimated 500 deaths were needed for the study to have 90% power to confirm noninferiority of SLND alone compared with ALND, with the use of a 2-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) for the HR from a Cox regression model.29 Specifically, if the 90% CI for the HR was below 1.3, this would indicate that patients undergoing SLND alone do not have an unacceptably worse overall survival than patients undergoing SLND plus ALND. The use of a 2-sided 90% CI corresponds to a 1-sided significance level of .05.30 The enrollment of 1900 patients in 4 years with a minimum follow-up period of 5 years was initially planned. Four formal interim analyses and 1 final analysis were planned for overall survival, and the O\u2019Brien-Flemming \u03b1-spending strategy was used to generate stopping boundaries for each planned analysis. The overall study significance was maintained at .05. However, none of the planned interim analyses were performed before the study was closed based on the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring committee. Because of this, a single terminal hypothesis test with an \u03b1 of .05 is applied to the data, which makes it consistent with the planned overall significance level of .05 in the original study plan. Ineligible patients were retained in all analyses (ie, both the intent-to-treat analyses and the treatment-received analyses). Kaplan-Meier survival curves for overall survival were compared by log-rank test. The unadjusted HR (and 90% CI) was calculated using a Cox regression analysis, and noninferiority P values are reported. As a secondary analysis, known prognostic factors including adjuvant treatment were included in the Cox regression model to generate an adjusted HR for overall survival (with a 90% CI and noninferiority P values). Disease-free survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses with 95% CIs. The fact that there were only 94 deaths limited the number of variables that could be used in a multivariable model without affecting model stability. We created a base model that included the treatment group (SLND alone vs ALND), age (\u226450 vs >50 years), and whether the patient received adjuvant therapy (yes vs no) and added prognostic variables to this model individually. Only variables obtained on 90% or more of the patients were included in the multivariable analysis. Locoregional recurrence rates were compared with the Fisher exact test. Each analysis, other than analysis for the primary end point of overall survival, was performed with 2-sided P values, 5% significance, and a 95% CI; all analyses were performed using SAS release 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina). \n \n Previous Section Next Section RESULTS Patient Characteristics The first patient was enrolled in May 1999, and accrual closed in December 2004 based on a recommendation of the independent data and safety monitoring committee because of concerns regarding the extremely low mortality rate. Even if the trial had accrued the targeted 1900 patients, it would have taken more than 20 years of follow-up to observe 500 deaths at the realized event rate. At the time of the decision to terminate the study there had been no formal analysis comparing the survival experience between the 2 groups; the decision was based solely on the observed mortality rate for pooled data from the 2 groups. The date of last follow-up for this analysis was March 4, 2010. Patients were enrolled from 115 institutions, which included affiliates of the Cancer Trials Support Unit and the North Central Cancer Treatment Group. Of 891 patients, 445 were randomly assigned to the ALND group and 446 to the SLND-alone group (Figure 1). Thirty-five patients were excluded after withdrawing consent prior to surgery. The 103 ineligible patients were included in the analyses reported here. Because this was a noninferiority trial, a more conservative analysis was performed on the treatment-received sample (n = 813 patients); 32 patients in the ALND group did not have ALND, and 11 patients in the SLND-alone group had ALND. No qualitative differences were observed between treatment-received sample and intent-to-treat sample analyses, so only intent-to-treat results are reported. Disease characteristics at baseline were well balanced between the 2 groups (Table 1). View larger version: Download as PowerPoint Slide Figure 1.

Baseline Patient and Tumor Characteristics by Study Group Treatment Results There was an expected difference between ALND and SLND-alone treatment groups in total number of removed lymph nodes and total number of tumor-involved nodes; the median total number of nodes removed was 17 (interquartile range [IQR], 13-22) in the ALND group and 2 (IQR, 1-4) in the SLND-alone group.31 The median total number of nodes with histologically demonstrated tumor involvement (including SLNs) in the ALND group and SLND-alone group was equal (1 [IQR, 1-2] for both groups). Hematoxylin-eosin\u2013stained tumor deposits no larger than 2 mm were defined as micrometastases and were identified in SLNs of 137 of 365 patients (37.5%) in the ALND group compared with 164 of 366 (44.8%) in the SLND-alone group (P = .05). In the ALND group, 97 of 355 patients (27.3%) had additional metastasis in lymph nodes removed by ALND, including 10% of patients with SLN micrometastasis who had macroscopically involved non-SLNs removed. Total nodal involvement is summarized in Table 1; 21.0% of patients undergoing ALND had 3 or more involved nodes compared with 3.7% undergoing SLND alone. Four or more involved nodes were seen in 13.7% of patients receiving ALND and 1.0% of those receiving SLND alone. Adjuvant systemic therapy was delivered to 403 women (96.0%) in the ALND group and 423 women (97.0%) in the SLND-alone group.31 No differences in the proportion of women receiving endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, or both were observed. The type of chemotherapy administered was similar in the 2 groups; anthracycline- and taxane-based combination regimens were the most common. The majority of the women (n = 605) received whole-breast radiation therapy: 263 of 296 (88.9%) in the ALND group and 277 of 309 (89.6%) in the SLND-alone group. Overall Survival At a median follow-up of 6.3 years (IQR, 5.2-7.7), there were 94 deaths (SLND-alone group, 42; ALND group, 52). The use of SLND alone compared with ALND did not appear to result in statistically inferior survival (Figure 2) (P = .008 for noninferiority). The unadjusted HR comparing overall survival between the SLND-alone group and the ALND group was 0.79 (90% CI, 0.56-1.10), which did not cross the specified boundary of 1.3 (Figure 3). The 5-year overall survival rates were 92.5% (95% CI, 90.0%-95.1%) in the SLND-alone group and 91.8% (95% CI, 89.1%-94.5%) in the ALND group. This was substantially greater than the 80% anticipated at protocol design. The HR for overall survival adjusting for adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and/or radiation therapy) and age for the SLND-alone group compared with the ALND group was 0.87 (90% CI, 0.62-1.23). The adjusted HRs comparing the SLND-alone group with the ALND group in the other multivariable models ranged from 0.86 to 0.92 (Table 2), all similar to the unadjusted rate of 0.79. An exploratory analysis revealed that treatment with ALND vs SLND alone produced no statistically significant difference in outcome among patients grouped by receptor status of the primary tumor (ER+/PR+ or ER\u2212/PR\u2212).

Adjusted Hazard Ratios for Overall Survival Comparing SLND-Alone vs ALND Groups Disease-Free Survival Disease-free survival (Figure 2) did not differ significantly between treatment groups. The 5-year disease-free survival was 83.9% (95% CI, 80.2%-87.9%) for the SLND-alone group and 82.2% (95% CI, 78.3%-86.3%) for the ALND group (P = .14). The unadjusted HR comparing the SLND-alone group with the ALND group was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.58-1.17), and the HR adjusted for adjuvant treatment and age was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.62-1.25) (Table 3). The adjusted HRs comparing the SLND-alone group with the ALND group in the other multivariable models ranged from 0.84 to 0.89 (Table 3), all similar to the unadjusted rate of 0.82. Locoregional recurrence and its correlates have been previously reported.31 The 5-year rates of local recurrence were 1.6% (95% CI, 0.7%-3.3%) in the SLND-alone group and 3.1% (95% CI, 1.7%-5.2%) in the ALND group (P = .11). Locoregional recurrence\u2013free survival at 5 years was 96.7% (95% CI, 94.7%-98.6%) in the SLND-alone group and 95.7% (95% CI, 93.6%-97.9%) in the ALND group (P = .28). View this table: Download as PowerPoint Slide Table 3. Adjusted Hazard Ratios for Disease-Free Survival Comparing SLND-Alone vs ALND Groups Surgical Morbidities Paresthesias, shoulder pain, weakness, lymphedema, and axillary web syndrome are recognized morbidities of ALND.7,8,9 As previously reported,10 the rate of wound infections, axillary seromas, and paresthesias among patients in the Z0011 trial was higher for the ALND group than for the SLND-alone group (70% vs 25%, P < .001). Lymphedema in the ALND group was significantly more common by subjective report (P < .001) and also tended to be higher by objective assessment of arm circumference. These findings are in accordance with other randomized comparisons of SLND with vs without ALND.32,33 \n \n Previous Section Next Section COMMENT In the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 randomized trial, ALND did not significantly affect overall or disease-free survival of patients with clinical T1-T2 breast cancer and a positive SLN who were treated with lumpectomy, adjuvant systemic therapy, and tangential-field whole-breast radiation therapy. These survival findings are consistent with those of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B04 trial, in which women with clinically negative nodes were randomized to treatment by radical mastectomy, total mastectomy plus nodal irradiation, or total mastectomy with delayed ALND if nodal recurrence was observed.4 Initially and at each interim analysis for up to 25 years of follow-up, no statistically significant survival differences were observed between any of the groups. For patients treated in the modern era, the relevance of the B04 study, which included patients with larger tumors undergoing mastectomy without adjuvant systemic therapy, is uncertain, because an axillary recurrence after SLND in patients with a lower risk of death from distant disease might negatively affect survival. The findings from Z0011 document the high rate of locoregional control achieved with modern multimodality therapy, even without ALND. In contrast to B04, in which about 40% of patients in the radical mastectomy group were node-positive and the same number in the total mastectomy group were assumed to be node-positive and 5-year overall survival was only about 60%, 100% of patients in Z0011 had nodal involvement; yet the 5-year overall survival was more than 90%. Furthermore, a 19% rate of axillary first failure was observed in B04,4 whereas the axillary nodal recurrence rate was only 0.9% in the SLND-alone group in Z0011.31 The excellent local and distant outcomes in this study highlight the effects of multiple changes in breast cancer management during the interval between the 2 studies. These changes, which include improved imaging, more detailed pathological evaluation, improved planning of surgical and radiation approaches, and more effective systemic therapy, emphasize the need for ongoing reevaluation of \u201cstandard\u201d local therapy. The well-documented morbidity from ALND has led other investigators to explore alternative methods of axillary treatment in patients with clinically negative nodes, including radiation, systemic therapy, and axillary observation. These have consistently demonstrated low axillary failure rates, with no significant differences in survival.34,35 The International Breast Cancer Study Group trial of ALND vs observation is noteworthy because more than half of the patients did not receive breast or axillary radiotherapy. In women 60 years and older receiving adjuvant tamoxifen but no axillary treatment, the rate of axillary recurrence was only 3%, and overall survival was 73% at a median follow-up of 6.6 years.36 The low rates of locoregional recurrence at 5 years and the nearly identical overall and disease-free survival between treatment groups in Z0011 would suggest that differences in survival between study groups are unlikely to emerge with longer follow-up, because ALND would only affect survival by virtue of improved locoregional control. In the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group overview, statistically significant survival differences between treatments at 15 years were seen only when differences in locoregional recurrence between treatments were greater than 10% at 5 years.6 Axillary recurrence is usually an early event, occurring at a median of 14.8 months in B04; in that trial, only 7 of 68 axillary recurrences occurred more than 5 years after study entry.4 Greco et al37 reported that median time to axillary recurrence was 30.6 months for 401 patients who underwent breast-conserving procedures and radiation therapy with no axillary surgery. Recent reports of long-term follow-up in randomized trials confirm these findings.38,39 Because the total locoregional recurrence rate in the Z0011 SLND-alone group at 5 years is only 2.5% compared with 3.6% in the ALND group, it is unlikely that further follow-up would result in enough additional recurrences to generate a clinically meaningful survival difference between groups. The absolute difference in 5-year overall survival between the treatment groups in Z0011 is 0.7%, numerically favoring the SLND-alone group. The HR for overall survival comparing the SLND-alone group with the ALND group was 0.79 (90% CI, 0.56-1.10). The worst HR (1.10) is less than 1.3, which was hypothesized as the inferiority margin threshold. In essence, this means that the 5-year overall survival for the SLND-alone group might be as low as 90.3% if the true 5-year overall survival for the ALND group was 91.8% and the HR as high as 1.10. Most importantly, there is no suggestion that rates of locoregional recurrence, the mechanism by which variations in local therapy result in survival differences, differ between groups to the extent needed to produce survival differences or are likely to do so in the future. Taken together, this suggests that contemporary women may sustain the morbidity of ALND without any meaningful improvement in survival rates. Limitations of the study, such as failure to achieve target accrual and possible randomization imbalance favoring the SLND-alone group, must be considered. However, even in high-risk women (ER\u2212/PR\u2212) in Z0011, preliminary analysis suggests no effect of elimination of ALND on survival. Despite limitations of the Z0011 trial, its findings could have important implications for clinical practice. Examination of the regional nodes with SLND can identify hematoxylin-eosin\u2013detected metastases that would indicate a higher risk for systemic disease and the need for systemic therapy to reduce that risk. Results from Z0011 indicate that women with a positive SLN and clinical T1-T2 tumors undergoing lumpectomy with radiation therapy followed by systemic therapy do not benefit from the addition of ALND in terms of local control, disease-free survival, or overall survival. The only additional information gained from ALND is the number of nodes containing metastases. This prognostic information is unlikely to change systemic therapy decisions and is obtained at the cost of a significant increase in morbidity.10 The only rationale for ALND in these patients would be if the finding of additional nodal metastases would result in changes in systemic therapy. Because current guidelines do not support differences in adjuvant systemic therapy based on the number of positive lymph nodes, except in some uncommon select subgroups,40 ALND does not appear to be warranted in this patient population. The Z0011 trial did not include patients undergoing mastectomy, those undergoing lumpectomy without radiotherapy, those treated with partial-breast irradiation, those receiving neoadjuvant therapy, and those receiving whole-breast irradiation in the prone position, in which the low axilla is not treated. In those patients, ALND remains standard practice when SLND identifies a positive SLN. However, ALND may no longer be justified for women who have clinical T1-T2 breast cancer and hematoxylin-eosin\u2013detected metastasis in the SLN and who are treated with breast-conserving surgery, whole-breast irradiation, and adjuvant systemic therapy. Implementation of this practice change would improve clinical outcomes in thousands of women each year by reducing the complications associated with ALND and improving quality of life with no diminution in survival. \n \n Previous Section Next Section Author Information Author Affiliations: John Wayne Cancer Institute at Saint John\u2019s Health Center, Santa Monica, California (Dr Giuliano); M.

Surgeons have been removing lymph nodes from under the arms of breast cancer patients for 100 years, believing it would prolong women\u2019s lives by keeping the cancer from spreading or coming back. \n \n Now, researchers report that for women who meet certain criteria \u2014 about 20 percent of patients, or 40,000 women a year in the United States \u2014 taking out cancerous nodes has no advantage. It does not change the treatment plan, improve survival or make the cancer less likely to recur. And it can cause complications like infection and lymphedema, a chronic swelling in the arm that ranges from mild to disabling. \n \n Removing the cancerous lymph nodes proved unnecessary because the women in the study had chemotherapy and radiation, which probably wiped out any disease in the nodes, the researchers said. Those treatments are now standard for women with breast cancer in the lymph nodes, based on the realization that once the disease reaches the nodes, it has the potential to spread to vital organs and cannot be eliminated by surgery alone. \n \n Experts say that the new findings, combined with similar ones from earlier studies, should change medical practice for many patients. Some centers have already acted on the new information. Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan changed its practice in September, because doctors knew the study results before they were published. But more widespread change may take time, experts say, because the belief in removing nodes is so deeply ingrained. \n \n \u201cThis is such a radical change in thought that it\u2019s been hard for many people to get their heads around it,\u201d said Dr. Monica Morrow, chief of the breast service at Sloan-Kettering and an author of the study, which is being published Wednesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association. The National Cancer Institute paid for the study. \n \n Doctors and patients alike find it easy to accept more cancer treatment on the basis of a study, Dr. Morrow said, but get scared when the data favor less treatment. \n \n The new findings are part of a trend to move away from radical surgery for breast cancer. Rates of mastectomy, removal of the whole breast, began declining in the 1980s after studies found that for many patients, survival rates after lumpectomy and radiation were just as good as those after mastectomy. \n \n The trend reflects an evolving understanding of breast cancer. In decades past, there was a belief that surgery could \u201cget it all\u201d \u2014 eradicate the cancer before it could spread to organs and bones. But research has found that breast cancer can begin to spread early, even when tumors are small, leaving microscopic traces of the disease after surgery. \n \n The modern approach is to cut out obvious tumors \u2014 because lumps big enough to detect may be too dense for drugs and radiation to destroy \u2014 and to use radiation and chemotherapy to wipe out microscopic disease in other places. \n \n But doctors have continued to think that even microscopic disease in the lymph nodes should be cut out to improve the odds of survival. And until recently, they counted cancerous lymph nodes to gauge the severity of the disease and choose chemotherapy. But now the number is not so often used to determine drug treatment, doctors say. What matters more is whether the disease has reached any nodes at all. If any are positive, the disease could become deadly. Chemotherapy is recommended, and the drugs are the same, no matter how many nodes are involved. \n \n The new results do not apply to all patients, only to women whose disease and treatment meet the criteria in the study. \n \n The tumors were early, at clinical stage T1 or T2, meaning less than two inches across. Biopsies of one or two armpit nodes had found cancer, but the nodes were not enlarged enough to be felt during an exam, and the cancer had not spread anywhere else. The women had lumpectomies, and most also had radiation to the entire breast, and chemotherapy or hormone-blocking drugs, or both. \n \n The study, at 115 medical centers, included 891 patients. Their median age was in the mid-50s, and they were followed for a median of 6.3 years. \n \n After the initial node biopsy, the women were assigned at random to have 10 or more additional nodes removed, or to leave the nodes alone. In 27 percent of the women who had additional nodes removed, those nodes were cancerous. But over time, the two groups had no difference in survival: more than 90 percent survived at least five years. Recurrence rates in the armpit were also similar, less than 1 percent. If breast cancer is going to recur under the arm, it tends to do so early, so the follow-up period was long enough, the researchers said. \n \n One potential weakness in the study is that there was not complete follow-up information on 166 women, about equal numbers from each group. The researchers said that did not affect the results. A statistician who was not part of the study said the missing information should have been discussed further, but probably did not have an important impact. \n \n It is not known whether the findings also apply to women who do not have radiation and chemotherapy, or to those who have only part of the breast irradiated. Nor is it known whether the findings could be applied to other types of cancer. \n \n The results mean that women like those in the study will still have to have at least one lymph node removed, to look for cancer and decide whether they will need more treatment. But taking out just one or a few nodes should be enough. \n \n Dr. Armando E. Giuliano, the lead author of the study and the chief of surgical oncology at the John Wayne Cancer Institute at St. John\u2019s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif., said: \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t come as a big surprise, but it will. It\u2019s hard for us as surgeons and medical oncologists and radiation oncologists to accept that you don\u2019t have to remove the nodes in the armpit.\u201d \n \n Dr. Grant W.

In an interview with ABC News this week, Damon said alleged sexual misconduct by powerful men involved \u201ca spectrum of behaviour\u201d. \n \n Damon said there was \u201ca difference between patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation. Both of those behaviours need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn\u2019t be conflated.\u201d \n \n \n \n He added that society was in a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d and said it was \u201cwonderful that women are feeling empowered to tell their stories and it\u2019s totally necessary\u201d. But he said: \u201cWe live in this culture of outrage and injury, that we\u2019re going to have to correct enough to kind of go, \u2018Wait a minute. None of us came here perfect.\u2019\u201d \n \n In her first response to Damon, Driver wrote on Twitter: \u201cGod God, seriously? \n \n \n \n \u201cGosh it\u2019s so interesting (profoundly unsurprising) how men with all these opinions about women\u2019s differentiation between sexual misconduct, assault and rape reveal themselves to be utterly tone deaf and as a result, systemically part of the problem.\u201d \n \n Driver\u2019s response to Damon was shared widely on social media, alongside that of the actor Alyssa Milano, who said: \u201cThere are different stages of cancer. Some more treatable than others. But it\u2019s still cancer.\u201d \n \n On Saturday, Driver told the Guardian: \u201cI felt I desperately needed to say something. I\u2019ve realised that most men, good men, the men that I love, there is a cut-off in their ability to understand. They simply cannot understand what abuse is like on a daily level. \n \n \u201cI honestly think that until we get on the same page, you can\u2019t tell a woman about their abuse. A man cannot do that. No one can. It is so individual and so personal, it\u2019s galling when a powerful man steps up and starts dictating the terms, whether he intends it or not.\u201d \n \n Driver\u2019s comments come more than two months into a radical national reappraisal of gender relations begun by accusations against Harvey Weinstein, an executive producer of Good Will Hunting who denies allegations including sexual assault and rape. \n \n Speaking to ABC, Damon compared allegations against Weinstein, Al Franken, Kevin Spacey and the comedian Louis CK, whom he commended for his remorseful response. \n \n \u201cThat\u2019s the sign of somebody who \u2013 well, we can work with that,\u201d Damon said, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t know Louis CK. I\u2019ve never met him. I\u2019m a fan of his, but I don\u2019t imagine he\u2019s going to do those things again. You know what I mean? I imagine the price that he\u2019s paid at this point is so beyond anything ... \u201d \n \n Driver said that as accusations, suspensions and firings first swept through Hollywood, she initially refrained from comment. She was now moved to expand her initial response to Damon. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t understand why Matt would defend Louis CK,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seems to me that he thinks that because he didn\u2019t rape somebody \u2013 so far as we know \u2013 that what he did do wasn\u2019t as bad.\u201d \n \n The comedian was accused of misconduct including masturbating in front of a number of women. In response, he said \u201cthese stories are true\u201d but did not specifically apologise. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Matt Damon attends a screening in New York. Photograph: Evan Agostini/Invision/AP \n \n \u201cThat\u2019s a problem,\u201d Driver continued. \u201cIf good men like Matt Damon are thinking like that then we\u2019re in a lot of fucking trouble. We need good intelligent men to say this is all bad across the board, condemn it all and start again.\u201d \n \n Driver argued that men should not be granted the power to interpret abuse inflicted on women without the risk of redoubling an injustice they can scarcely understand. \n \n \u201cI felt that what Matt Damon was saying was an Orwellian idea, we are all equal except that some us are more equal than others,\u201d she said. \u201cPut abuse in there \u2026 that all abuse is equal but some is worse.\u201d \n \n She added: \u201cThere is no hierarchy of abuse \u2013 that if a woman is raped [it] is much worse than if woman has a penis exposed to her that she didn\u2019t want or ask for \u2026 you cannot tell those women that one is supposed to feel worse than the other. \n \n \u201cAnd it certainly can\u2019t be prescribed by a man. The idea of tone deafness is the idea there [is] no equivalency. \n \n Peter Jackson: I blacklisted Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino under pressure from Weinstein Read more \n \n \u201cHow about: it\u2019s all fucking wrong and it\u2019s all bad, and until you start seeing it under one umbrella it\u2019s not your job to compartmentalise or judge what is worse and what is not. Let women do the speaking up right now. The time right now is for men just to listen and not have an opinion about it for once.\u201d \n \n Since the first publication of allegations against Weinstein, a number of women have come forward to detail abuse they have suffered. This week, the actor Salma Hayek wrote a long essay for the New York Times about her treatment by Weinstein. \n \n \u201cThere is not a woman I know,\u201d Driver said, \u201cmyself included, who has not experienced verbal abuse and sexual epithets their whole fucking life, right up to being manhandled and having my career threatened several times by men I wouldn\u2019t sleep with.\u201d \n \n Driver did not elaborate on the persons or circumstances involved. But she expressed optimism that as the culture of harassment and abuse that has existed is exposed, men will find a way to support women. \n \n \u201cIn the same stereotypical way that we see women being supportive of men in their endeavors,\u201d she said, \u201cI feel that\u2019s what women need of men in this moment. They need men to lean on and not question. \n \n \u201cMen can rally and they can support, but I don\u2019t think its appropriate, per se, for men to have an opinion about how women should be metabolising abuse. Ever.\u201d \n \n ||||| Matt Damon addressed the sexual allegations against Harvey Weinstein, saying, \u201cI knew I wouldn\u2019t want him married to anyone close to me.\u201d \n \n Interested in Harvey Weinstein? Add Harvey Weinstein as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Harvey Weinstein news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest \n \n \u201cBut that was the extent of what we knew. I mean, and that wasn\u2019t a surprise to anybody. So when you hear Harvey this, Harvey that \u2014 I mean, look at the guy. Of course he\u2019s a womanizer,\u201d Damon continued in an interview for ABC News\u2019 \u201cPopcorn With Peter Travers.\u201d \n \n Damon, who stars in the upcoming film \u201cDownsizing,\u201d worked with Weinstein on his Oscar-winning film \u201cGood Will Hunting,\u201d which was produced by Weinstein\u2019s production company Miramax. \n \n In the past year, several women have publicly accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct. Weinstein has acknowledged inappropriate behavior but has denied any allegations of nonconsensual sex. \n \n \u201cAny allegations of nonconsensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances,\u201d his spokesman previously said. \n \n In a wide-ranging discussion with Travers on Tuesday, Damon opened up about Weinstein and others inside and outside the entertainment world who have been publicly accused of sexual misconduct this year. \n \n Read part of Damon\u2019s conversation with Travers below. \n \n Maryellen McGrath/ABC \n \n Peter Travers: We live now in a different age, in a political age. There\u2019s a lot of dissidence that goes on in the world that could affect you as an actor. We\u2019re also in the age of people charged with sexual misconduct. This is everywhere. How do you react to that? Especially you, as the father of four girls. \n \n Matt Damon: I think we\u2019re in this watershed moment. I think it\u2019s great. I think it\u2019s wonderful that women are feeling empowered to tell their stories, and it\u2019s totally necessary \u2026 I do believe that there\u2019s a spectrum of behavior, right? And we\u2019re going to have to figure \u2014 you know, there\u2019s a difference between, you know, patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation, right? Both of those behaviors need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn\u2019t be conflated, right? You know, we see somebody like Al Franken, right? \u2014 I personally would have preferred if they had an Ethics Committee investigation, you know what I mean? It\u2019s like at what point \u2014 you know, we\u2019re so energized to kind of get retribution, I think. \n \n And we live in this culture of outrage and injury, and, you know, that we\u2019re going to have to correct enough to kind of go, \u201cWait a minute. None of us came here perfect.\u201d You know what I mean? \u2026 The Louis C.K. thing, I don\u2019t know all the details. I don\u2019t do deep dives on this, but I did see his statement, which kind of, which [was] arresting to me. When he came out and said, \u201cI did this. I did these things. These women are all telling the truth.\u201d And I just remember thinking, \u201cWell, that\u2019s the sign of somebody who \u2014 well, we can work with that\u201d \u2026 Like, when I\u2019m raising my kids, this constant personal responsibility is as important as anything else they learn before they go off in the world. \n \n And the fear for me is that right now, we\u2019re in this moment where at the moment \u2014 and I hope it doesn\u2019t stay this way \u2014 the clearer signal to men and to younger people is, deny it. Because if you take responsibility for what you did, your life\u2019s going to get ruined \u2026 \n \n I mean, look, as I said, all of that behavior needs to be confronted, but there is a continuum. And on this end of the continuum where you have rape and child molestation or whatever, you know, that\u2019s prison. Right? And that\u2019s what needs to happen. OK? And then we can talk about rehabilitation and everything else. That\u2019s criminal behavior, and it needs to be dealt with that way. The other stuff is just kind of shameful and gross, and I just think \u2026 I don\u2019t know Louis C.K.. I\u2019ve never met him. I\u2019m a fan of his, but I don\u2019t imagine he\u2019s going to do those things again. You know what I mean? I imagine the price that he\u2019s paid at this point is so beyond anything that he \u2014 I just think that we have to kind of start delineating between what these behaviors are. \n \n PT: It\u2019s harder, isn\u2019t it, though, when you actually know someone who gets accused? We both know Harvey Weinstein. I\u2019ve worked with him. But I didn\u2019t see any of this. \n \n MD: When you see Al Franken taking a picture putting his hands on that woman\u2019s flak jacket and mugging for the camera, going like that, you know, that is just like a terrible joke, and it\u2019s not funny. It\u2019s wrong, and he shouldn\u2019t have done that \u2026 But when you talk about Harvey and what he\u2019s accused of, there are no pictures of that. He knew he was up to no good. There\u2019s no witnesses. There\u2019s no pictures. There\u2019s no braggadocio \u2026 So they don\u2019t belong in the same category. \n \n PT: I think it becomes for all of us, too, that are in any way around it, even though we\u2019re not seeing it, is, what\u2019s our responsibility to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen? \n \n MD: A lot of people said, \u2018Well, Harvey \u2014 everybody knew.\u2019 As you were saying, that\u2019s not true. Everybody knew what kind of guy he was in the sense that if you took a meeting with him, you knew that he was tough and he was a bully, and that was his reputation. And he enjoyed that reputation, because he was making the best movies out there \u2026 \n \n [With regard to the rape allegations,] nobody who made movies for him knew \u2026 Any human being would have put a stop to that, no matter who he was. They would\u2019ve said absolutely no. You know what I mean? \u2026 I knew I wouldn\u2019t want him married to anyone close to me. But that was the extent of what we knew, you know? And that wasn\u2019t a surprise to anybody. So when you hear Harvey this, Harvey that \u2014 I mean, look at the guy. Of course he\u2019s a womanizer \u2026 I mean, I don\u2019t hang out with him. \n \n PT: But you can\u2019t live his life for him. Or be responsible for his life. \n \n MD: Right. So the question is, at what point does somebody\u2019s behavior that you have a professional relationship with \u2026 away from the profession bother enough that you don\u2019t want to work with them? For me, I\u2019ve always kind of, you know, as long as nobody\u2019s committing a crime \u2014 well, that\u2019s your life, and you go live it. I don\u2019t need to be spending time with you, away from my professional life, at least. \n \n Maryellen McGrath/ABC \n \n PT: [We\u2019ve seen] Ridley Scott, who directed you in \u201cThe Martian,\u201d having to erase Kevin Spacey from \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d and having to replace him with Christopher Plummer. \n \n MD: That was smart. That was a total business decision by Ridley. I haven\u2019t talked to him, but \u2026 it wasn\u2019t a creative choice for Ridley. Ridley has a big movie coming out \u2026 and nobody right now is in the mood to see a Kevin Spacey movie. \n \n And I think he\u2019s right about that. He\u2019s one of the few directors who could just turn on a dime and shoot for a week a month before a movie comes out and, you know, expunge an actor. And I don\u2019t disagree with his decision to do that. I mean, that movie, I think, will do much better without Kevin in it. \n \n [Editor\u2019s note: In response to the allegations against him made by Anthony Rapp, Kevin Spacey released a statement on Oct. 29, saying, in part, \u201cI\u2019m beyond horrified to hear his story. I honestly do not remember the encounter \u2026 But if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior.\u201d In November a spokesperson for Spacey said he was \u201ctaking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment.\u201d] \n \n PT: When it\u2019s in that gray area and it\u2019s friends of yours or people that you do know, do you try to talk to them afterwards and say, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Can I help?\u201d \n \n MD: It depends on what the accusation is. It depends what\u2019s going on. If it\u2019s a friend of mine, I\u2019m always talking to them. I know the real story if it\u2019s my friend. If it\u2019s a colleague \u2026 I don\u2019t know \u2026 I guess it depends on the situation and the allegation and how believable I think it is. \n \n PT: We\u2019re going to see the change in the making of movies now with people being so aware. \n \n MD: I also think the day of the confidentiality agreements is over. I think it\u2019s just completely over. Ten years ago, you made a claim against me and I had a big movie coming out, OK? I have $100 million or I have a movie that is personally important to me coming out, and close to the release of that film, you say, \u201cMatt Damon grabbed my butt and stuck his tongue down my throat.\u201d We would then go to mediation and organize a settlement. I\u2019d go, \u201cI don\u2019t want this out there. Peter\u2019s going to go out and talk to the press and run his mouth, and it\u2019s going to be overshadowing the opening of this movie. How much money do you want?\u201d The lawyers would get together, and they do this cost-benefit analysis, and they\u2019d go, \u201cOh, this is what it\u2019s worth.\u201d And I look at the number and go, \u201cOK, I\u2019ll pay it, but you can never talk about this again. You\u2019re f------ lying about this, but never talk about this again. \n \n Now \u2026 with social media, these stories get \u2014 it\u2019s like they get gasoline poured on them. So the moment a claim is made, if you make that same claim today to me, I would be scorched earth. I\u2019d go, \u201cI don\u2019t care if it costs $10 million to fight this in court with you for 10 years, you are not taking my name from me. You are not taking my name and my reputation from me. I\u2019ve worked too hard for it. And I earned it. You can\u2019t just blow me up like that.\u201d So I think once a claim is made, there will no longer be settlements. That\u2019s just my prediction, I mean, just based on what I\u2019ve seen. \n \n PT: Isn\u2019t that a good thing? Women have been doing it, and they\u2019ve been told they can\u2019t express what happened to them. \n \n MD: One hundred percent \u2026 I think that it\u2019s important, especially in that, you know, we believe every woman who\u2019s coming forward with one of these stories needs to be listened to and heard. I think one of the surprising things for me has been the extent to which my female friends, as, I think, of all the ones I\u2019ve talked to in the last year since all this stuff started happening \u2014 I can\u2019t think of any of them who don\u2019t have a story at some point in their life. And most of them have more than one. \n \n PT: I don\u2019t know how old your daughters are, but how do you deal with them living in this world where even they, whatever ages they are, can\u2019t escape this in the headlines? \n \n MD: You just have to raise children with, like, self-esteem, because you\u2019re not going to be there to make all of their decisions for them. And you have to just hope that they have enough self-respect to make the best decisions they can. I mean, the Harvey situation is particularly horrible, because, you know, those women \u2014 when you say, \u201cHey, let\u2019s take a meeting in a hotel room.\u201d I mean, we auditioned, you know, for \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d in a hotel room. Like, it\u2019s common to take meetings in a hotel room. \n \n And this is the most powerful man in the movie business at the time, like in the \u201990s, like Harvey was. That was the place to be. And if you get a thing from your agent on the letterhead of your agency that says, \u201cGo meet Harvey Weinstein, the rainmaker, the guy that makes these great movies, at the Peninsula Hotel,\u201d you\u2019re going to that meeting \u2026 You don\u2019t go into that meeting thinking something bad is going to happen to you \u2026 I don\u2019t know who\u2019s taking meetings in hotel rooms now. I mean, sometimes you\u2019re in a different city and you just don\u2019t have anywhere to meet. But, so no matter how smart my daughters are, no matter how prepared they are, there\u2019s still those situations that that\u2019s the nightmare kind of scenario. \n \n Play \n \n PT: Do you worry about your daughters less because of the change in the industry? \n \n MD: With social media, you know, and a Twitter account, you have the same platform as The New York Times now, so there aren\u2019t secrets. It\u2019s harder to do this type of thing. I would like to point out, though, that even though it feels like there\u2019s this avalanche of men \u2026 Well here\u2019s my optimistic spin, this is like 1 percent of the guys who are losing their careers. It\u2019s not everybody. It just feels like it. There\u2019s so many great men and women in the movie business. So many great people. It\u2019s such a wonderful collection of people overall. And these rotten horrible apples are getting weeded out right now. \n \n And that\u2019s fine. That\u2019s a good thing. That\u2019s progress. But again, when we go back to talking about our own growth and development as human beings. We have to get to a place where we\u2019re looking at one end of the spectrum and saying, \u201cWell, let\u2019s deal with this with some reflection and dialogue and some reconciliation, and let\u2019s all grow together and move on.\u201d And then I\u2019ll think we\u2019ll be making progress. \n \n Watch part of Matt Damon\u2019s interview in the video above, and tune in for the full ABC News\u2019 \u201cPopcorn With Peter Travers\u201d interview on Dec. 27, on ABCNews.com. \n \n Download the \"Popcorn With Peter Travers\" podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Tunein, Google Play Music and Stitcher. \n \n Editor\u2019s note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity. ||||| I have been a victim of each component of the sexual assault spectrum of which you speak.

His parents told authorities the boy disappeared during a family camping trip near Leadore. Search teams combed the area, but found no trace of the toddler. \n \n MORE: New details released in missing 2-year-old, DeOrr Kunz Jr., case \n \n Bowerman said he believes DeOrr's parents know where he is and whether he is dead or alive. \n \n \"They're not able to tell the same story twice because they've told so many stories, you know, getting changes in the story all the time,\" he said. \n \n \n \n Bowerman says when he confronted the parents, they refused to give any additional information to clear up their inconsistencies. \n \n The pair are not under arrest, and no warrants have been issued. Bowerman said he has met with prosecutors, the FBI and the Bonneville County Sheriff's Office and plans to take his time and make sure the case is solid before bringing charges against Mitchell and Kunz. \n \n \"We don't feel that the arrest is imminent, but we're leaving all options open,\" he said. \"We don't want to jeopardize the investigation and charge them too early, for fear that we might find DeOrr and it might change.\" \n \n Private investigators with Klein Investigations and Consulting hired by the family said earlier this month they had ruled out the possibility of an abduction or attack by a wild animal in DeOrr's disappearance. \n \n Bowerman said he still hopes the public can help investigators by contacting authorities with any information that could help the investigation. \n \n \"We're asking the public at this time to come forward with any information that they might have concerning the parents and their interaction with their son DeOrr that they might have witnessed,\" he said. \n \n The sheriff stressed that the naming of suspects in the case did not mean the hunt for the toddler was being pushed to a back burner. \n \n \"I want to find Deorr. That's my top priority. He's my victim here. That's my goal is to find Deorr Kunz and to solve this investigation,\" said Bowerman. \n \n DeOrr is now three years old. He was two when he disappeared, but he turned three on Dec. 30. \n \n The sheriff says he was holding off naming the parents as suspects because he wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt, and to see if any other information would come out that would prove otherwise. \n \n Sheriff reponds to fundraising questions \n \n Bowerman also says he wanted to release this information because his office has gotten a lot of calls from the public about whether they should donate money to help find DeOrr. \n \n On Jan. 16, the family held a dinner, raffle, auction to help raise money to pay for the private investigator. \n \n Trina Clegg, Jessica Mitchell's mother and DeOrr's grandmother, says the family has raised $15,000, and every penny of that is going to pay for the private investigator out of Texas. \n \n We asked the sheriff about fundraising efforts, here is what he had to say: \n \n \"I'm getting a lot of calls from the public - should we donate money to help find Deorr Kunz? And I can't honestly say yes or no knowing that the family is less than truthful. I think it's only fair that the public knows that they are suspects that we are continuing our investigation and that they aren't being truthful.\" \n \n DeOrr's grandmother says the family is no longer asking for money, but the website -- Miracles For Little Man -- will remain online. \n \n Trina Clegg says someone else is running the website.

The fire department says it still doesn't know what caused so many to get sick at once; the health department is looking into it. In the meantime, the area where most of the patients seemed to fall ill has been cordoned off, and although many children were picked up by family, about 50 or so of the 115 attendees remained, per the New York Daily News. The kids at the camp range in age from 8 to 15.",

    "document": "The good news for Tony Dungy is that once upon a time enough people in power, be it in football \u2026 education \u2026 government \u2026 wherever, decided that they should empower African-Americans with the opportunities they deserved. They did this no matter whether things would go \"totally smooth\" or cause \"things to happen\" with the bigots who wanted to cling to the old days. \n \n At some point they said someone such as Dungy deserved to go to school with white people, play football with white people, even coach football like white people once exclusively did, even at the highest levels of the NFL. They rejected the ancient concept that blacks either weren't deserving/capable of such opportunities. Even more important, they ignored the idiotic idea that until every last racist was completely and wholly comfortable with a black man playing, learning or working alongside them (let alone be the boss) then such opportunity should continue to be withheld. \n \n The smartest people pushed the dumbest aside and decided to just let the best person win. \n \n Michael Sam is trying to make the roster with the Rams as a seventh-round draft pick. (AP) More \n \n And Tony Dungy won. From high school in Jackson, Mich., to college at the University of Minnesota, to the NFL as both a Super Bowl-winning player and coach. It continued as a best-selling author, coveted and highly compensated speaker and now high-profile analyst on NBC, front and center on the No. 1 television show in America. \n \n Despite all of that, Dungy decided to throw gasoline on the training camp story of the year by telling the Tampa Tribune that unlike the St. Louis Rams, he never would have drafted Michael Sam, the NFL's first openly homosexual player, because someone (who, he didn't say) might not handle it so well. \n \n \"I wouldn't have taken him,'' Dungy told the Tribune. \"Not because I don't believe Michael Sam should have a chance to play, but I wouldn't want to deal with all of it \u2026 It's not going to be totally smooth \u2026 things will happen.'' \n \n This thinking is devoid of courage \u2013 in every possible way. And that's what makes this so pathetic. \n \n Dungy has a well-earned reputation as a straight shooter and a stand-up guy. It's almost impossible to play and work in the NFL without self-belief and heart. He is a powerful figure. He says a lot of smart things. He knows tough times and consistently finds time for people going through them. \n \n He should be a lot better than this. \n \n Dungy is an outspoken conservative Christian and if he were to say that he wouldn't have drafted Michael Sam because the Bible that Dungy believes in condemns Sam's lifestyle that would be \u2026 well, that would be ridiculous, hypocritical and wrong also, but at least it would seemingly jibe with Dungy's sometimes expressed beliefs. \n \n Sometimes being the operative word. \n \n Dungy, is, after all, a guy who has drafted, hired, signed, coached, championed and personally mentored scores of players and coaches who routinely engaged in Biblical definitions of sin, let alone behavior that goes against modern societal standards. He was (rightfully) a huge proponent, for instance, of Michael Vick deserving a second chance after incarceration for the operation of a dog-fighting ring. \n \n Still, at least it would be some kind of principled (if misguided) stance. At least it would've been honest. \n \n This is actually worse. This is a complete cop-out. This is Dungy bending to the beliefs that he knows are wrong simply because those who hold them may \u2013 may \u2013 find doing the right thing difficult. \n \n Read More ||||| Uh Oh! Tony Dungy Says He Wouldn\u00c2\u2019t Have Drafted Michael Sam \n \n RUSH: CBS News Pittsburgh. This is the, \u201cUh-oh!\u201d I have it right here. It\u2019s a Pittsburgh.CBSlocal.com report: \u201cFormer Pittsburgh Steeler defensive coordinator, NFL head coach, and NBC analyst Tony Dungy is making headlines after reportedly saying he wouldn\u2019t have drafted Michael Sam because he is gay, and wouldn\u2019t want to \u2018deal with it.\u2019 \n \n \u201cDungy told the Tampa Bay Times that he wouldn\u00c2\u2019t have taken Sam, \u2018Not because I don\u2019t believe Michael Sam should have a chance to play, but I wouldn\u2019t want to deal with all of it.\u2019 Michael Sam is a former Missouri linebacker, SEC player of the year, and openly gay. He was drafted in the 7th round of the NFL draft by the St. Louis [Lambs]. Dungy told the paper, \u2018It\u00c2\u2019s not going to be totally smooth \u2026 things will happen.'\u201d \n \n \n \n Things are getting ready to happen right now, if this is true. I mean, it says the word \u201creport\u201d in here. \u201cAfter reportedly saying,\u201d and it says, \u201cDungy told the Tampa Bay Times that he wouldn\u00c2\u2019t have taken Sam, \u2018Not because I don\u2019t believe Michael Sam should have a chance to play, but I wouldn\u2019t want to deal with all of it,'\u201d meaning the Rams are not a football team this season. \n \n They are a social experiment. \n \n That\u2019s what he means. Well, I don\u2019t want to put words in his mouth. It\u2019s just gonna be a constant\u2026 The media presence is gonna be there, and no matter what decision the coaching staff makes about Sam \u2014 whether he plays or not, whether he gets cut or not \u2014 it\u2019s all gonna be held up through the prism of, \u201cIs it because he\u2019s gay?\u201d Like if he gets cut \u2014 which I don\u2019t think he can be. \n \n I, frankly, just\u2026 I don\u2019t think anything\u2019s in writing but I don\u2019t think he can get cut. Let\u2019s say he is. Can you imagine? Sportswriters are dumber and more liberal than their news counterparts, and they\u2019re gonna be out there. The story is gonna be from, \u201cWas he cut because he\u2019s gay? Was he drafted \u2019cause he\u2019s gay just so the goodwill could accrue to the league, and now they\u2019re saying he can\u2019t play? \n \n \u201cThey knew he shouldn\u2019t play! Should he have never been drafted in the first place? Was it all a publicity stunt?\u201d That will be one angle. Another angle will be related to, \u201cOkay, maybe he can\u2019t play, maybe he\u2019s good as a backup, maybe he can\u2019t start, but why cut him? Why can\u2019t they make the statement of keeping the first openly gay player in the league?\u201d It\u2019s just not gonna end, and there\u2019s no right move that the league or the Lambs can make. \n \n It\u2019s like when there was a dearth of African-American head coaches, and then that was ameliorated somewhat with a number of them being hired. Well, you get hired to get fired in the NFL. So many African-American coaches, after being hired, were then fired. And there was not a cacophony of charges of discrimination against black coaches after they were hired because teams could respond: \n \n \u201cHey, hey, hey, hey! What do you mean discrimination? We hired the guy,\u201d and that pretty much held sway. That ruled the roost. But, now, if Michael Sam gets cut, and the Rams\u2026 Look, I don\u2019t even want to get into this, and I have nothing to do with it. But if he gets cut? Whew! They better have a lot of tape. He better play in all four preseason games. They better have the evidence that he\u2019s cut because he just can\u2019t make it, if that\u2019s the case. \n \n I\u2019m not saying he can\u2019t. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gonna happen. What Dungy is referring to is these eagle eyes that are gonna be on this, and this is no longer about a football team in the NFL. It\u2019s a social experiment. He\u2019s just saying, if the report is accurate, he wouldn\u2019t want to deal with the distraction of it all as a coach. It\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t think Sam should get an opportunity. \n \n Now, Tony Dungy\u2026 Speaking moral authority, Tony Dungy has it. Tony Dungy, in the NFL today, is the go-to guy for the right answer to every controversial question. He has earned that. Everybody wants to know what Tony thinks. You know, \u201cWhat would Jesus do?\u201d What would Dungy do? What does Dungy think? He has achieved that lofty perch in the NFL. That\u2019s why this story is gonna be, \u201cUh-oh!\u201d \n \n BREAK TRANSCRIPT \n \n \n \n RUSH: Anyway, a couple of snarky e-mails. \u201cSo, when are the gay activists going to demand that Tony Dungy be fired at NBC? When do you think that\u2019ll happen, Rush?\u201d Because, if you\u2019re just joining us, and it has now been confirmed, Tony Dungy did tell, and he\u2019s the moral authority of the NFL. When there is a moral dilemma or conundrum, they turn to Tony Dungy, the league does, other players do. They seek Dungy\u2019s counsel on things. He\u2019s achieved that status. He is a man of God. He\u2019s considered incorruptible. \n \n He told the Tampa Bay Times that he would not have drafted Michael Sam if he were head coach in the league precisely because Michael Sam was gay, that he would not want to deal with the mess, meaning the media circus. He said it\u2019s not that I\u2019m opposed to Michael Sam having an opportunity to play; I just wouldn\u2019t have picked him. Which, you people e-mailing me wondering about snark comments, there are. \n \n I have seen, I have found a couple of mini-snark comments in Drive-By sports media. The first half of the stories: Dungy unassailable, Dungy moral authority, Dungy understandable. But then at the end of the story, \u201cBut this is where Coach Dungy runs into trouble, because if it\u2019s okay to discriminate against minorities because of too much trouble, then where would he be in the league?\u201d \n \n So, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gonna happen here. You would think that Dungy would, I don\u2019t know, be immune. But even in some of the Drive-By sports media, they\u2019re gonna have problems with this. (interruption) You want to ask me an NFL marketing question? By all means, ask me the NFL marketing much. What is it? (interruption) Perhaps. Snerdley wants to know, \u201cCould it be that drafting the first openly gay player is a marketing ploy by the Rams \u2019cause you know it\u2019s gonna sell tickets.\u201d \n \n It might attract, it might expand the NFL audience to include gay people who may not be football fans, who might now be converted to football. Is that what you mean? (interruption) Or just want to be supportive? (interruption) Okay. So the Rams might sell more tickets than they otherwise would have because people just want be to supportive of the decision that they made. Anything\u2019s possible. I mean, if you can have the whole month of October as pink month in the NFL, you could have a rainbow day. You know, one Sunday rainbow Sunday. \n \n \n \n You could do a rainbow month as a marketing opportunity. Yeah. I suppose it\u2019s entirely possible. I don\u2019t see why not if they thought it was a marketing opportunity. (interruption) What do you mean if Dungy blames Republicans? Who said he blames Republicans? (interruption) Oh. Oh, well, but he didn\u2019t say that. Let\u2019s not start putting words in his mouth. (interruption) (laughing) Look, any words I put in Dungy\u2019s mouth the media\u2019s gonna write that I said. I\u2019m not gonna do that. Everybody\u2019s asking me, \u201cWell, Rush, what about this? What about this?\u201d \n \n You guys go get your own shows and then you raise those questions. What do you mean, what if Dungy had said, \u201cWell, the Republicans aren\u2019t gonna stay fans anymore.\u201d He didn\u2019t say that. Why bring the Republicans into this? (laughing) Oh, you mean like blame the Tea Party? The Tea Party must have gotten to Dungy or something? Nah. I don\u2019t think \u2014 well, anything is possible, but it is the news, Dungy did say it. It has been confirmed and there is some discomfort and unease out there in the sports Drive-Bys. I\u2019ve already detected some. \n \n It\u2019s very, very carefully worded right now. They\u2019re tiptoeing into the water of this, waiting for media brethren to sign on and support any sentiment that might be opposed to Tony Dungy on this. (interruption) It is. The sports media\u2019s dumber than the regular news media, and it\u2019s more liberal. Hey, I am not the only one who thinks that. I know I\u2019m the only one who said it. That\u2019s true. \n \n I mentioned \u2014 well, I am courageous in that way. I told you I was at a golf tournament over the weekend. I can\u2019t tell you, it was a record number of people on the golf course and at the related social functions, people didn\u2019t even introduce themselves, they kept saying \u201cDon\u2019t stop what you\u2019re doing.\u201d I haven\u2019t heard that in I don\u2019t know how many years. \u201cDon\u2019t stop what you\u2019re doing.\u201d \n \n Most people, \u201cHey, great to meet you. I love listening to your show, blah, blah, blah.\u201d \n \n \u201cDon\u2019t stop what you\u2019re doing.\u201d Well, the staff has always told me that, yes. But I\u2019m talking about members of the audience, as a specific thing to say. I mean, there was a sense of urgency and fear behind it all, and appreciation.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Tony Dungy says he's not prejudiced, despite his comment a couple days ago that he wouldn't have drafted openly gay player Michael Sam, TMZ reports. \"I gave my honest answer, which is that I felt drafting him would bring much distraction to the team,\" Dungy said in a statement. He added that Sam deserves a chance to play, and Dungy would coach him, but said that \"the media attention that comes with it will be a distraction.\" A few reactions to Dungy's initial comments: \"Given Dungy's religious nature, his Indiana Family Institute affiliation and his expressed opposition to gay marriage, I wouldn't expect Dungy to open the door too widely to a gay athlete,\" writes Bob Kravitz at the Indianapolis Star. \"It is, however, disappointing.\" Slate dug up a tweet Dungy posted about President Obama's support for marriage equality: \"What is your take on the President's stance on gay marriage? I was disappointed he veered from biblical view.\" At Yahoo, Dan Wetzel argues that Dungy may be forgetting how blacks overcame prejudices to play pro ball, or how Dungy advocated for Michael Vick's return after Vick served time on dog-fighting charges. Now, Dungy's \"thinking is devoid of courage\u2014in every possible way.\" Enter Rush Limbaugh, who says that if the St. Louis Rams should cut Sam, people will say it's because he's gay\u2014just as people did when the first black coaches were fired.

On a hissing old tape recording, she asks her toddler son who he is. And in the tiniest, helium-pitched voice, he replies, \u201cI\u2019m Kurt Cobain!\u201d It just about breaks your heart. Could the live-fast-die-young god of grunge ever have been so sweet and innocent? \n \n It\u2019s been more than two decades since Cobain was found dead at age 27, the victim of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head\u2014the intimations of which could be found in his lyrics and were known to his closest friends. In the immediate aftermath of his death, the myth-building began, as it tends to do with artists who leave us too soon. Since then, the narrative of Cobain\u2019s life\u2014on and off the stage and in and out of rehab\u2014has become as familiar and ossified as gospel: the troubled Aberdeen, Wash., teen who started a garage band and vaulted to global superstardom, the sensitive soul swept up in a Sid-and-Nancy-like romance with Courtney Love, the battles with addiction, the overwhelming demands of fame, and the decision to check out. But as Morgen\u2019s brilliant film (which also premieres May 4 on HBO) shows, the narrative was never quite that tidy. Normally I\u2019m suspicious when a filmmaker gets into bed with his subject as Morgen has here. He had the cooperation of Cobain\u2019s family, widow, and daughter. But that access merely allows the director to make Cobain\u2019s story feel not only comprehensive and fresh but revelatory. Morgen gives us the man instead of the myth. \n \n Montage of Heck begins at the beginning, showing us the bright, happy kid who sinks into restless depression (the \u201cteenage angst\u201d that later \u201cpaid off well\u201d). He\u2019s shuttled between his divorced parents, never quite fitting in or feeling at home. Through hauntingly animated sequences that bring the young Cobain\u2019s scribbled journals to life, we start to sympathize with the loneliness that eventually led him to form the band that would become his surrogate family. From there, we see Nirvana\u2019s underground success with Bleach, followed by the meteoric, multiplatinum success of Nevermind and all the adulation and attention that followed. Interviews with Love, bandmate Krist Novoselic, and Cobain\u2019s first girlfriend flesh out the portrait and hint at the inevitability of the musician\u2019s tragic path, including the most difficult scene to watch in the film: a home movie where Cobain seemingly nods off on drugs as Love cuts their young daughter\u2019s hair. It\u2019s uncomfortable. It almost feels too private. And some Nirvana fans, who like their icons unblemished, may choose to look away. But it proves that Morgen isn\u2019t interested in hagiography. He wants to show us the real Kurt Cobain, warts and all. A ||||| Frances Bean, who is now 25, was just 20 months old when her father killed himself, far too young to know him. After spending much of her life avoiding his myth and his music, she told Rolling Stone that the movie allowed her to \"know\" him in an unfiltered way. Through it, she discovered that her father truly loved her. ||||| \u201cKurt Cobain: Montage of Heck,\u201d Brett Morgen\u2019s family-approved documentary about the prodigiously talented and troubled leader of Nirvana, opens with a credit for its source material. Mr. Morgen was given access to Cobain\u2019s archives \u2014 \u201cart, music, journals, Super 8 films and audio montages\u201d \u2014 and his exhilarating, exhausting, two-hour-plus film, both an artful mosaic and a hammering barrage, reflects years of rummaging through that trove. \n \n \u201cMontage of Heck\u201d is really a series of montages, both visual (Mr. Morgen and Joe Beshenkovsky were the editors) and aural (Cameron Frankley did the sound design). Swirls of images flash by \u2014 childhood family movies, journal and notebook entries, Cobain\u2019s drawings and paintings, scenes of life on the road, concert footage, magazine articles, the home movies of Cobain and his wife, Courtney Love \u2014 set to an intricately layered soundtrack of Nirvana songs, archival interviews and the semiconfessional audiotapes he made as part of his diverse, constant artistic output. \n \n Continue reading the main story Video \n \n You\u2019re never unaware of this virtuosity \u2014 \u201cMontage\u201d is, more than anything, an editing tour de force \u2014 or of the highly constructed nature of Mr. Morgen\u2019s narrative. The film stops short of Cobain\u2019s suicide in 1994, which is recounted in a one-sentence title card. But a portrait is assembled of Cobain as relentlessly self-aware and self-critical, and a theory is advanced involving insecurity and shame. And Mr. Morgen \u2014 able to choose from the archives \u2014 finds abundant clues and premonitions in Cobain\u2019s writings and uses a full bag of film tricks to make them tell the story he wants told. \n \n Photo \n \n Ultimate answers about the suicide, or about the nature of Cobain\u2019s relationship with Ms. Love, are still elusive, though. When it comes down to it, Mr. Morgen is faced with the opacity and the nondramatic, self-fulfilling nature of the drug addiction story. This is partly why the first hour, with its home-movie footage of an angelic, hyperactive Cobain as a child and its animated sequences of his adolescence, set to his own taped narration, is the best part of the film. (Though the later scenes of Cobain and Ms. Love living in comfortable, generally cheerful rock-star squalor have their own fascination.) \n \n Mr. Morgen\u2019s reliance on Cobain\u2019s personal material goes along with an unusual sparseness of interview subjects for a biographical documentary \u2014 just seven, including his mother, father and sister, his bandmate Krist Novoselic and Ms. Love. (The Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl was interviewed but not included in the film.) You can speculate about how complete a picture we\u2019re getting, given that Ms. Love\u2019s and Cobain\u2019s daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, was an executive producer of the film, but that\u2019s all you can do. \n \n Cobain\u2019s and Nirvana\u2019s music is heard throughout, and there are unusual bonuses, like a shot of Cobain fiercely running through \u201cDrain You\u201d at a sound check or a poignant tape of him singing the Beatles\u2019 \u201cAnd I Love Her.\u201d Oddly, we don\u2019t really see Cobain\u2019s development as a musician \u2014 he seems to appear fully formed, while the film concentrates on Cobain the writer, draftsman and personality. You\u2019re not likely to mind, though, for the duration of Mr. Morgen\u2019s seamless mystery ride.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It's pretty much unanimous: Critics are in love with Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck, the documentary produced by Cobain's daughter, which hits theaters today before premiering on HBO next month.

Here's what critics are saying: Director Brett Morgen \"gives us the man instead of the myth\" in a documentary that makes \"Cobain's story feel not only comprehensive and fresh but revelatory,\" Chris Nashawaty writes at Entertainment Weekly. Some parts, including a home video of Cobain nodding off on drugs, are \"uncomfortable,\" but \"Morgen isn't interested in hagiography.

It \"downplays commentary to stress raw evidence drawn from Cobain's deep archives.\" Viewers will see \"a strung-out Cobain struggling to hold his infant daughter,\" Farber writes, and hear him speak about a high school suicide attempt. The film as a whole leaves \"questions, frustrations, and a chill.\" \"Edited from thousands of photographs, home movies, and audio clips\" the \"source materials alone [make] this film a must-see for any hard-core Nirvana fan,\" Charles R. Cross writes at the Seattle Times. The highlights come in \"segments where noirish animations dramatize stories Cobain himself narrates in audio.\" Though the \"many powerful images on screen ... begin to overwhelm the viewer,\" most will be left \"cheering.\" Mike Hale describes the film as a \"seamless mystery ride\" that \"concentrates on Cobain the writer, draftsman, and personality.\" Morgen \"finds abundant clues and premonitions in Cobain\u2019s writings\" to suggest that \"insecurity and shame\" played a role in his suicide, though the truth remains elusive, Hale writes at the New York Times. His favorite part? Seeing an \"angelic\" Cobain as a child in the first half of the two-hour-plus film. Frances Bean Cobain recently spoke publicly about her dad.",

    "document": "New research shows that for women who eat apples, there might be more to that old adage about the forbidden fruit's health effects than previously thought. According to a recent study in Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics, women who consume apples on a regular basis tend to experience greater overall sexual function, reporting higher levels of arousal and satisfaction. \n \n Researchers analyzed the apple-eating habits of 731 sexually active Italian women over the course of seven months, polling participants between the ages of 18 and 43 with no history of sexual dysfunction. The women were classified into two groups -- those who ate one to two apples daily and those who ate none -- and asked to fill out the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), which includes more than a dozen questions regarding desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction and pain. All in all, Group A (the apple-eaters) totaled higher FSFI scores than their non-apple-eating counterparts, indicating increased lubrication and general sexual function. \n \n The researchers are quick to point out that while their results are \"intriguing,\" they should be taken with caution. The study's small sample size makes it difficult to categorize too broadly, although the positive correlation between apples and better sex they found seems to speak for itself. Possible explanations for the link include the multiple antioxidants and other pharmacologically active substances (like phytoestrogens and polyphenols) present in apples, which have been associated with positive sexual effects before. The fruit shows similar sexual benefits as red wine and chocolate, but with other added health effects as well. \n \n It's also possible that the sexual health benefits come more from apple peels -- which have high concentrations of helpful phenolic compound -- than from the apples themselves. This study included only women who did not peel their apples before eating them, but the researchers speculate that it \"might be interesting to evaluate\" whether apple peels play a more specific role in female sexuality. We'll wait for that future study -- while snacking on some unpeeled apples. \n \n (h/t Huffington Post) ||||| It's been said that an apple a day keeps the doctor away, but new research suggests it can do a lot more than that. \n \n A new study published in Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics suggests that eating more apples leads to better sex for women. \n \n Researchers analyzed 731 sexually active Italian women aged 18 to 43 with no history or complaint of sexual disorder. Women taking prescription drugs or suffering from depression were excluded from the study as well. \n \n Participants were separated into two groups: regular apple consumption (one to two apples a day) and no apple consumption (0 to 0.5 apples per day). The women then filled out the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), which is comprised of 19 questions about sexual function, sexual frequency, orgasm, lubrication and overall sexual satisfaction. \n \n Researchers found that \"daily apple use is associated with higher FSFI scores in sexually active female patients, thus increasing their lubrication and overall sexual function.\" \n \n So why apples? \n \n The researchers hypothesize that apples may improve sexual function because, like red wine and chocolate, they contain polyphenols and antioxidants that can stimulate blood flow to the genitalia and vagina, thus helping with arousal. \n \n Not only that, researchers says apples contain phloridzin, a common phytoestrogen that is structurally similar to estradiol -- a female sex hormone -- and plays a huge role in vaginal lubrication and female sexuality. \n \n Of course, the study has its limitations. It's a relatively small sample size and it's difficult to separate correlation from causation. However, the researchers note the results are \"intriguing,\" to say the least. \n \n Now excuse us while we go eat some apples. \n \n Keep in touch!

We aim to assess whether there is a tie between daily apple intake and sexual function in a sample of healthy young sexually active Italian women, not complaining of any sexual disorders. \n \n MATERIALS AND METHODS: \n \n Seven hundred and thirty-one women (mean age 31.9, range 18-43) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study (from September 2011 to April 2012). All participants completed anonymously the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and were asked to report on their amount of daily apple consumption and their eating habits. On the basis of apple consumption all women were split into two groups: Group A--regular daily apple consumption, Group B--no regular apple consumption (<1 apple/day). The main outcome measure was the FSFI questionnaire result. \n \n RESULTS: \n \n Three hundred and forty-three women reported a regular daily apple intake and were classified in Group A, while 388 were included in Group B. Group A had a significantly higher total (p = 0.001; Cohen's d = 3.39) and lubrication domain (p = 0.001; Cohen's d = 3.02) FSFI scores than participants in Group B. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that daily apple intake must be considered as an independent parameter (p = 0.002) in predicting a better score at questionnaire examination. \n \n DISCUSSION:",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Eating the forbidden fruit of an apple tree may be even racier than the Bible says.

    "document": "George Pataki speaks during the CNN Republican presidential debate at the in Las Vegas earlier this month. (John Locher/AP) \n \n Former New York governor George Pataki suspended his bid for the Republican presidential nomination Tuesday, after a campaign that appeared doomed almost from the start by both his long stretch out of the national spotlight and the mismatch between his moderate politics and a party turning harder to the right. \n \n Pataki announced the suspension of his campaign in a two-minute message that aired on NBC affiliates in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. He secured the free air time through an \u201cequal time\u201d request made after GOP front-runner Donald Trump hosted the network\u2019s popular \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d program. \n \n Seated in front of a fireplace, Pataki said that the country needs to elect a president who can do three things: \u201cconfront and defeat radical Islam, shrink the size and power of Washington, and unite us again in our belief in this great country.\u201d \n \n \u201cI\u2019m confident we can elect the right person. Someone who will bring us together and who understands that politicians \u2014 including the president \u2014 must be the people\u2019s servant and not their master,\u201d he said. \n \n Pataki, 70, once was an impressive figure in Republican politics: He upset a Democratic legend, then-New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, in 1994 and won reelection twice in a famously liberal state. Pataki flirted with a presidential run three times before, in 2000, 2008 and 2012. \n \n But each time, he withdrew. For one reason or another, Pataki said, the moment wasn\u2019t right. \n \n Then this year, he flirted again \u2014 and actually ran. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m ready. I know that the need to change Washington is as big as [it has] been in my lifetime. I know the need to have a vision for the future of this country is absolutely essential. I have that vision. My life has prepared me for this moment,\u201d he told The Washington Post and the TV station NH1 when he announced his candidacy May 28. \n \n But, as it turned out, his moment had already passed. \n \n Pataki has not held office since 2006, and his name recognition has eroded sharply since then; when \u201cJeopardy!\u201d contestants were shown his picture earlier this year, none of them could supply his name. The key moments of Pataki\u2019s political biography were even further in the past: the trying days after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the stupendous defeat of Cuomo in 1994. \n \n At times, too, Pataki\u2019s platform seemed out of a different time and aimed at a different Republican Party. Pataki supports abortion rights and had signed a strict gun-control measure in New York. He also told voters that true governance required compromise and that he\u2019d learned how to share power with Democrats in Albany. \n \n \u201cI understand that to change Washington you have to understand government as well. You can\u2019t just be an outsider. You can\u2019t just be someone who throws stones at Washington,\u201d Pataki said in the Oct. 28 \u201cundercard\u201d debate. \u201cYou have to be someone who can actually bring people together across party lines.\u201d \n \n That was the wrong message for this year\u2019s GOP, in which many primary voters believe their leaders already turn to compromise far too eagerly, and far too soon. They blame Republican leaders in Washington for capitulating to President Obama and for being unable to deliver victories like sharp cutbacks in spending and the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. This year, in fact, compromise was getting even longtime leaders like House Speaker John A. Boehner (Ohio) pushed out of Washington. \n \n It was certainly not any Republican\u2019s ticket in. \n \n At times, Pataki seemed bewildered by the campaign he\u2019d entered, led by outsiders who portrayed themselves as insurgents, with theatrical gestures of disdain for Washington and its current occupants. \n \n \u201cIt is turning the American presidency into a reality gong show, and that\u2019s not right,\u201d Pataki said last month, lamenting the influence of Donald Trump on the campaign. So even his jokes were old: The original \u201cGong Show,\u201d an absurdist TV variety show, broadcast its last new episode in 1980. \n \n In national polls, Pataki rarely made it above 1 percent. Even in New Hampshire \u2014 the key moderate-leaning state that Pataki visited dozens of times \u2014 his best showing was 2 percent. And that was back in July. In more recent months, Pataki was polling at 1 or zero percent even in the Granite State, where he was overshadowed by better-known politicians like Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who are aiming at the same bloc of moderate voters. \n \n Pataki never made the main stage at any GOP debate. Once, he even failed to make the undercard event. \n \n Over the summer, Pataki tried a gambit that others \u2014 including Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal \u2014 had attempted and failed. He attacked GOP front-runner Donald Trump, calling the bombastic billionaire \u201cidiotic\u201d for his plan to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country now. \n \n But Pataki had brought a knife to an artillery barrage. \n \n Trump blasted Pataki on social media and in speeches, lambasting the former governor \u2014 someone Trump had once praised \u2014 as a terrible politician. \n \n \u201cHe\u2019s got nothing. He was a terrible governor of New York. He couldn\u2019t have been elected dogcatcher,\u201d Trump said in a rant in Iowa in November. \u201cThen he didn\u2019t even make the child\u2019s stage [at the debate] two days ago! And I hear he\u2019s still not quitting! He\u2019s got zero chance.\u201d \n \n For Pataki, this tactic didn\u2019t work. Trump stayed up. He stayed down. \n \n By late August, it was clear that the prize Pataki had flirted with for so long would elude him \u2014 even Pataki\u2019s own political mentor and closest ally in politics, former New York senator Alfonse D\u2019Amato (R), gave up on him. \n \n D\u2019Amato endorsed another presidential candidate instead: Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R). \n \n \u201cHe\u2019s a friend. He\u2019s bright. He\u2019s articulate,\u201d D\u2019Amato said of Pataki, according to Newsday. \u201cBut there is no way he can carry Ohio.\u201d \n \n Ed O\u2019Keefe in Keene, N.H., contributed to this report. ||||| \"Tonight is the end of my journey for the White House,\" former New York Gov.

Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the panel. \n \n The favorable recommendation comes after Haspel told Congress, in a letter sent to Warner on Monday, that she now feels the spy agency should not have employed the harsh interrogations program used on al Qaeda detainees that included waterboarding. \n \n In the letter, Haspel also acknowledged that it was \"a mistake\" for the CIA not to have briefed Congress about the program at its inception. \n \n \"With the benefit of hindsight and my experience as a senior agency leader, the enhanced interrogation program is not one the CIA should have undertaken,\" she wrote in the letter to Warner. \n \n \"While I won't condemn those that made these hard calls, and I have noted the valuable intelligence collected, the program ultimately did damage to our officers and our standing in the world,\" Haspel continued. \n \n She had not expressed those feelings publicly, during her contentious confirmation hearing last week.

She joined the CIA in 1985 and has held a series of high-ranking positions at the intelligence agency throughout her lengthy career, including senior leadership positions within the agency's National Clandestine Service, which oversees the agency's spy operations overseas and its most covert operations programs. \n \n At the request of Congress, the CIA has declassified documents shedding light on Haspel's career in covert operations, particularly in her reported role at the agency's \"black site\" in Thailand. \n \n The committee's report on the CIA's rendition program said senior al Qaeda operatives Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri were detained at that location. \n \n The report said that while at the black site in Thailand in 2002, Zubaydah was subjected to the controversial practice of waterboarding 83 times and to other \"stress\" techniques such as being slammed against walls, deprived of sleep and placed in a coffin-sized box for up to 226 hours. \n \n Two Republicans, Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and John McCain of Arizona, are opposed to Haspel's nomination. McCain is not expected to be in Washington for Haspel's confirmation vote. \n \n In March, McCain noted that Haspel's CIA career \"has intersected with the program of so-called 'enhanced interrogation techniques' on a number of occasions.\" \n \n \"The torture of detainees in U.S. custody during the last decade was one of the darkest chapters in American history,\" McCain said in a statement. \"Ms. Haspel needs to explain the nature and extent of her involvement in the CIA's interrogation program during the confirmation process.\" \n \n Republican Sen.

(Associated Press) \n \n Supporters at left of a tax on large companies such as Amazon and Starbucks that was intended to combat a growing homelessness crisis stand in Seattle City Council Chambers and face off against people at right supporting the repeal of the tax, Tuesday, June 12, 2018, at City Hall in Seattle. Seattle... (Associated Press) \n \n SEATTLE (AP) \u2014 A tax on large companies such as Amazon that was meant to fight a growing homelessness crisis got rolled back during a raucous Seattle City Council meeting that exposed divisions over how much companies that have fueled booming economies should help pay to alleviate the downsides of success. \n \n A divided crowd chanted, jeered and booed at the meeting, drowning out city leaders as they cast a 7-2 vote Tuesday. People shouted, \"Stop the repeal,\" as others unfurled a large red banner that read, \"Tax Amazon.\" An opposing group held \"No tax on jobs\" signs. \n \n The vote showed Amazon's ability to aggressively push back on government taxes, especially in its affluent hometown where it's the largest employer with more than 45,000 workers and where it has been criticized for contributing to a widening income gap. \n \n It remains to be seen whether Seattle's retreat will have a chilling effect on other cities considering taxes on big tech companies to help mitigate the effects of growth. \n \n The City Council in Mountain View, California, where Google is based, will vote June 26 on whether to put a similar measure before voters in November. The \"Google tax,\" which has unanimous support from the council, aims to alleviate transportation woes and high housing costs in the Silicon Valley city south of San Francisco. \n \n Mountain View Mayor Lenny Siegel said Seattle's about-face hasn't changed his support for the tax, the details of which the council and city administrators have been working on for several months. \n \n \"It appears that we have a better relationship with our business than Seattle does,\" Siegel said. \n \n He said Google hasn't taken a position on the proposal and that no \"groundswell\" of opposition has materialized from the Internet search giant and other companies. \n \n \"That doesn't mean they support it,\" Siegel said. \"Our chamber of commerce has not been excited by it.\" \n \n In Seattle, the tax was proposed as a progressive revenue source aimed at tackling one of the nation's highest homelessness numbers, a problem that hasn't eased even as city spending on the issue grew. \n \n Businesses and residents demanded more accountability in how Seattle funds homelessness and housing and said the city should take a regional approach to the problem. Many worried that Amazon and others would leave the city as the companies sharply criticized the tax. \n \n Amazon called Tuesday's vote \"the right decision for the region's economic prosperity.\" \n \n The company is \"deeply committed to being part of the solution to end homelessness in Seattle,\" Drew Herdener, an Amazon vice president, said in a statement. \n \n City leaders underestimated the frustration and anger from residents, businesses and others over not just a tax increase but also a growing sense that homelessness appears to have gotten worse, not better, despite Seattle spending millions to fight it. \n \n It poured $68 million into the effort last year and plans to spend more this year. The tax would have raised roughly $48 million annually. \n \n But a one-night count in January found more than 12,000 homeless people in the Seattle and surrounding region, a 4 percent increase from the previous year. The region saw 169 homeless deaths last year. \n \n Many supporters called the repeal a betrayal and said the tax was a step toward building badly needed affordable housing. They booed council members, imploring them to keep it and fight a coalition of businesses trying to get a referendum overturning the tax on the November ballot. \n \n \"It's frustrating to see the council be so spineless when the city has so much leverage for businesses to come here despite the tax,\" said Jake Lindsay, 25, a musician and Lyft driver who supported the tax. \n \n Several council members, including three who sponsored the legislation but voted to repeal it, lamented the reversal and conceded they didn't have the resources or time to fight the referendum. \n \n Councilwoman Lisa Herbold said it \"was truly our best option\" and that she repealed it with a heavy heart. She lashed out at business interests for blaming the problems on government inefficiencies. \n \n Seattle's so-called head tax would have charged companies about $275 per full-time worker each year for affordable housing and homeless services. It targeted nearly 600 businesses making at least $20 million in gross revenue and would have taken effect next year. \n \n Days after it passed, the business-backed No Tax On Jobs campaign began gathering signatures for the ballot and raised more than $280,000 in cash contributions in just weeks. \n \n In Silicon Valley, Siegel, the Mountain View mayor, said Google and other companies such as LinkedIn that are based in the California city acknowledge that soaring housing costs and long commutes make it harder to recruit and retain workers. \n \n He said city officials estimate the tax would raise about $10 million annually once it's completely phased in after three years. Google is expected to pay half. \n \n Siegel said public meetings that touched on the issue were \"moderately\" attended, and the proposal does not appear to be as contentious in Mountain View as in Seattle. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press reporter Paul Elias in San Francisco contributed to this report. ||||| Seattle Repeals Tax On Big Business After Opposition From Amazon, Starbucks \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Ted S. Warren/AP Ted S. Warren/AP \n \n In a victory for Amazon, the Seattle City Council voted to repeal a tax on the city's biggest businesses Tuesday, a measure designed to fund efforts to combat Seattle's large homeless population. \n \n In a meeting punctured with shouting from activists, council members voted 7-2 to repeal the so-called \"head tax,\" which would have raised about $47 million per year to fund affordable housing projects and to help the city's homeless population. \n \n It was a sharp reversal from just last month, when the council voted unanimously to pass the tax and the city's mayor signed it into law. \n \n Amazon, Starbucks and other companies then funded a campaign against the tax and to put it on a referendum to voters in November. \n \n Council member Lisa Herbold said the groups opposing the tax had \"unlimited resources\" and that her vote to repeal was \"counter to my values as a person.\" \n \n However, a campaign from business groups including the Chamber of Commerce had convinced most Seattle residents to oppose the tax and \"we don't have the time and we don't have the resources necessary to change enough minds,\" Herbold said. \n \n \"This is not a winnable battle at this time,\" she added. \n \n Seattle's government said the tax would only affect about 3 percent of the city's employers \u2014 those grossing at least $20 million each year. About 585 employers would have paid about $275 per employee per year, according to the city council. \n \n Amazon has about 45,000 employees in Seattle and is the city's largest private employer. It would have paid about $12 million per year. \n \n Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos was named the world's richest man by Forbes in March, with a worth of $112 billion. \n \n The company said the vote \"to repeal the tax on job creation is the right decision for the region's economic prosperity.\" \n \n Amazon, Starbucks and investment company Vulcan each paid $25,000 toward the referendum effort, KUOW reports. The No Tax on Jobs campaign raised $350,000. \n \n After the session to consider repealing the law was announced a day earlier, Seattle's Chamber of Commerce said it was a \"breath of fresh air.\" The Chamber echoed language from Amazon that it was a \"tax on jobs.\" \n \n \"From day one, the Seattle Metro Chamber has been clear that a tax on jobs is not the way to address the regional homelessness crisis,\" President and CEO Marilyn Strickland said in a statement Monday. \n \n The law passed in May was itself a watered-down version of the original plan, to tax companies $500 per employee. Amazon temporarily halted construction of a tower in downtown Seattle in opposition. \n \n Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan said she would sign the repeal into law. \"Instead of engaging in a prolonged, expensive political fight, the City and I will continue to move forward on building real partnerships that align our strategies from business, advocates, philanthropy,\" she said in a statement. \n \n Council members Teresa Mosqueda and Kshama Sawant both voted against the repeal. Sawant called it a \"cowardly betrayal of the needs of working people,\" saying it was \"capitulation and it's a betrayal.\" \n \n Critics of the tax reportedly saw the city's homeless problem growing, despite large amounts of spending by the city already. Seattle spent $68 million on fighting homelessness in 2017, according to The Associated Press. \n \n The city council said 8,522 people were counted as \"experiencing homelessness\" in Seattle in 2017. Including nearby areas, that number went up to 12,000 during a one-night count in January, the AP says, which is up 4 percent from the year before.

By the latest count, King County was home to more than 12,000 people experiencing homelessness, most of them in Seattle. \n \n \"We have reached the conclusion that this is not a winnable battle at this time,\" Councilwoman Lisa Herbold said before the vote. \"I am not someone who walks away from what looks like a losing fight, but ... there is so much more to lose between today and November.\" \n \n Pressure from Amazon had already cut the original tax nearly in half, but then the company joined Starbucks and others in backing a campaign to put the tax to a referendum vote this fall. The No Head Tax campaign had raised more than $285,000 through the end of May, according to filings with the city. \n \n RELATED: Seattle council approves smaller $48 million head tax for homelessness \n \n On Monday, the council and Mayor Jenny Durkan formally caved to the opposition, announcing Tuesday's special meeting and indicating they would largely support repeal. \n \n Against the din of protesters chanting in city council chambers, the council struggled to complete its vote on the measure, with Councilwoman Kshama Sawant holding out her vote until the crowd acknowledged the vote was happening behind them. The final tally was seven in favor, with just Sawant and Councilwoman Teresa Mosqueda dissenting. \n \n The decision to repeal the tax was blamed on the bottomless coffers of the opposition, a nod to Amazon's stunning wealth, and thus, influence in local politics. \n \n \"I have been unable to find a way forward that we could out-fund and out-resource the opposition campaign by November,\" said Councilwoman Lorena Gonzalez ahead of the vote. \"Money has funded this campaign that put us in a position where we have to repeal this law.\" \n \n During public comment on Tuesday, which ran 50 minutes before the council considered the measure, many called the moved to repeal with such little notice a \"betrayal\" and a \"backroom deal\" that put corporate interests above people. \n \n Now Playing: \n \n \"I wonder about the homeless state of emergency, I wonder if it's just that here we are in the city of Seattle paying lip service to a state of emergency but we're not actually fixing anything,\" said Matthew Lang, with the Hope Coalition. \n \n In a statement from seven members of the council and Durkan on Monday, they argued that the political fight to keep the tax would prove too costly and wouldn't help the homelessness crisis. Instead, they pointed to a need for the city to find a solution everyone could agree on. \n \n During comments before the vote Sawant pushed back on the idea that the council would come out ahead in backing down on the issue so soon. \n \n \"Do council members actually believe that by completely capitulating to big business today, that somehow we'll be in a better position to win this next year?\" she asked. \n \n Gonzalez ultimately backed the repeal effort, but hedged her support in a statement Monday. \n \n \"I am deeply troubled and disappointed by the political tactics utilized by a powerful faction of corporations that seem to prioritize corporations over people,\" she wrote in Monday's statement. \n \n Opponents to the tax have argued that the city hasn't properly handled the money it already has for dealing with the homelessness crisis, something that was officially declared a city emergency in November 2015 by then-mayor Ed Murray. \n \n Seattle has doubled its spending on homeless services in the last few years, with $63 million earmarked for the crisis in 2018. Countywide, about $195 million was spent in 2017, according to a Seattle Times analysis of funds that included state and federal sources. By comparison, San Francisco, where around 10,000 people are living without stable housing, will spend about $305 million this year on the crisis. \n \n Durkan recently said the city would launch a website detailing how it spends its homelessness funding, but the site hasn't appeared yet. Credit rating company Moody's gives Seattle an Aa2 credit rating, the third-highest rating, and found the head tax to be a credit positive move, while it warned of the impact Amazon may have on the local government of its HQ2 city, wherever that will be. \n \n Amazon had a big influence over what the head tax that did pass looked like. After the original proposal was released, the e-commerce company halted planning on two tower projects in Seattle pending a vote on the deal. Durkan struck a compromise deal that was just over half the original amount of the tax in response, a deal that Amazon approved enough to resume work on its tower projects. \n \n RELATED: Report: Amazon halts planning for new Seattle towers over head tax \n \n Neither council members or Mayor Durkan had offered up alternatives to generate the same funding that was expected from the head tax. \n \n Senior editor Daniel DeMay covers Seattle culture, city hall, and transportation for seattlepi.com.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 What does defeat sound like? This: \"We have reached the conclusion that this is not a winnable battle at this time.\" That was the pronouncement of Seattle Councilwoman Lisa Herbold Tuesday in advance of what ended up being a 7-2 vote to reverse a new tax the council had unanimously approved only a month prior. The so-called \"head tax\" would have generated just shy of $50 million annually to put toward homelessness and affordable housing by charging businesses that generate more than $20 million in revenue a year about $275 per employee. That would have hit about 3% of businesses in the city, one of which is Amazon, which would have contributed about 25% of the expected total, reports NPR. The company was vocal in its opposition. And per SeattlePI.com, the \"stunning wealth\" of Amazon, Starbucks, and the rest of the opposition drove the reversal. As Councilwoman Lorena Gonzalez explains, \"I have been unable to find a way forward that we could out-fund and out-resource the opposition campaign by November\" (the opposition was campaigning for a referendum on the tax in the fall). \"Money has funded this campaign that put us in a position where we have to repeal this law.\" The AP characterizes city leaders as having \"underestimated the frustration\" over not just the tax but the fact that while $68 million was spent on homelessness last year, a January count found the homeless population in the Seattle area up 4%, to 12,000, suggesting to some that the city's current resources weren't being used appropriately.",

I could feel myself losing consciousness and there was nothing I could do about it. I was pretty much dying. \n \n \u201cBut everyone was on the ball and the crew was well-drilled. They knew pretty much where I would be under the soil and after the digger had moved in behind me, the team were hand-balling the soil until they could reach me.\u201d \n \n WATCH: Buried Alive stunt goes wrong: 1949 video shows Manchester escapologist dug up by rescuers \n \n Alan Alan had to be pulled from the ground \n \n Antony said his biggest disappointment was to discover that he was just two feet from the surface when he had to be rescued. \n \n \u201cI gave it my all, but it just wasn\u2019t my day,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m in the best company going.\u201d \n \n Antony is only the third person in 100-years to attempt the Buried Alive escape. Legendary escapologist Harry Houdini attempted the feat in 1915 while British master of the craft Alan Alan tried it in 1949.

The escape bid was the highlight of an event which also featured magicians, bands and circus acts and held to raise funds for charity Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research, which is changing its name to Bloodwise this month. \n \n Antony, who heads not-for-profit company Escape for Life, had been due to undertake the escape bid outside the Traveller\u2019s Rest in Meltham in March, but called off the event due to unexpected snowfall. \n \n Saturday\u2019s event was also in the balance following rain earlier in the week, but after consulting experts Antony was given the all-clear. \n \n However, he won\u2019t be attempting the Buried Alive escape bid again.

But his team were forced to dig him out and pull him to the surface unconscious after he failed to emerge within nine minutes. \n \n Some in the audience at Slaithwaite Spa, near Huddersfield, were in tears as helpers cleared soil from Britton\u2019s mouth and throat before paramedics administered oxygen. \n \n He came around after several minutes, and later said he would think very carefully before making another attempt the challenge, despite nearly reaching the surface. \n \n Britton, who is recovering from a cracked rib, scratching and bruises, told the Guardian: \u201cAll I remember is, literally your life goes before your eyes. Really. And then I just passed out. \n \n \u201cIt was really weird because I\u2019m not saying I heard noises but my family was talking to me. Just before I passed out I could see both my grandfathers talking to me as if I was a kid. It\u2019s quite emotional when I think back what I went through. It fills me up. \n \n \u201cThen I just passed out and the next thing I know they dug me up and dragged me out.\u201d \n \n The stunt was the climax of the Buried Alive festival, hosted by Escape For Life, a non-profit started by Britton and his friends to raise money for charity with affordable events for the public. \n \n Britton attempted to perform the classic version of the escape, in which the escape artist is handcuffed and buried beneath six feet of soil without a casket. His job was to free himself from the cuffs and scrabble out through tons of heavy dirt. However, things quickly began to go wrong. \n \n \u201cThe soil was landing on top of me and around the side of me. It was compacting and crushing me. Every single time another bucket came it was getting worse. \n \n \u201cI managed to get an air hole. I remember exhaling and because I collapsed my lungs the soil compacted into that space which meant that when I went to inhale I couldn\u2019t. \n \n \u201cIt was not a problem, but I remember then getting my right arm stuck in the soil and I started passing out. At that point all sorts went through my head and I just remember thinking it\u2019s up to the ground crew to do their job.\u201d \n \n Assistants on the ground used a mechanical digger and their bare hands to disentomb Britton after they were no longer able to hear him breathing. \u201cThe digger driver was absolutely so skilful, I couldn\u2019t have got anybody better in the digger,\u201d Britton said. \u201cWhen he got the blade in he could have quite easily cut me in two with the pressure.\u201d \n \n Britton is believed to be only the third person in 100 years to attempt the escape. In 1915, Houdini made it as far as breaking the surface with his hand before assistants were forced to dig him up. Twenty-five years later, in 1940, a British escapologist, Alan Alan, attempted the challenge, and he too had to be rescued. \n \n In 1992 a 32-year-old American magician, Joe Burrus, died in his attempt at a variation of the stunt.

The prime minister urged citizens to \"get through this\" and strolled through the streets of the capital to chat with residents. \n \n Swedes flew flags at half-staff Saturday to commemorate the four people killed and 15 wounded when the hijacked truck plowed into a crowd of shoppers Friday afternoon in Stockholm. Prime Minister Stefan Lofven declared Monday a national day of mourning, with a minute of silence at noon. \n \n Sweden's police chief said authorities were confident they had detained the man who carried out the attack. \n \n \"There is nothing that tells us that we have the wrong person,\" Dan Eliason told a news conference Saturday, but added he did not know whether others were involved in the attack. \"We cannot exclude this.\" \n \n Eliason also said police found something in the truck that \"could be a bomb or an incendiary object, we are still investigating it.\" \n \n Prosecutor Hans Ihrman said the suspect has not yet spoken to authorities and could not confirm whether he was a legal resident of Sweden. Anders Thornberg, head of the Swedish Security Service, said security services were working with other nations' security agencies to investigate the attack, but declined to elaborate. \n \n Police declined to comment on media reports about overnight police raids around Stockholm or if they were hunting any more suspects in the case. They said the suspect had been on their radar before but not recently, and did not explain why authorities apparently had not considered him a serious threat. \n \n Eliason told reporters the suspect was \"a more marginal character.\" \n \n Sweden's health service said 10 people were still hospitalized for wounds from the attack and four of them were seriously injured. \n \n Many in Sweden were shocked by the attack, questioning whether Swedish society \u2014 considered democratic and egalitarian \u2014 had failed in some way. \n \n Visiting the attack site at an upscale department store, Sweden's Crown Princess Victoria laid roses on the ground Saturday and wiped away a tear. \n \n \"We must show a huge force, we must go against this,\" she told reporters. \n \n The stolen beer truck traveled for more than 500 yards (meters) along Drottninggatan, a main pedestrian street, before smashing into a crowd outside the popular Ahlens department store. \n \n The crash was near the site of a December 2010 attack in which Taimour Abdulwahab, a Swedish citizen who lived in Britain, detonated a suicide bomb, killing himself and injuring two others. He had rigged a car with explosives but the car bomb never went off. Abdulwahab died when one of his devices exploded among panicked Christmas shoppers. \n \n Steve Eklund, 35, who works in an office nearby, said \"maniacs can't be stopped.\" \n \n \"It's very simple. Things like this will always happen in an open society,\" Eklund said. \"Sweden is not a totalitarian society.\" \n \n In February, U.S. President Donald Trump suggested that Sweden could be the next European country to suffer the kind of extremist attacks that have devastated France, Belgium and Germany. Two days after his remarks, a riot broke out in predominantly immigrant suburb of Stockholm where police opened fire on rioters, a surprise to many Swedes who aren't used to officers using guns. \n \n \"We must get through this. Life must go on,\" Lofven said Saturday after again laying flowers near the crash site. \"We in Sweden want an open society.\" \n \n Lofven also made a point of walking around Stockholm, including along the Drottninggatan, chatting with people having coffee outside a cafe. \n \n The prime minister says said the aim of terrorism is to undermine democracy. \n \n \"But such a goal will never be achieved in Sweden,\" he said. \n \n ___ \n \n AP reporters Pietro DeCristofaro in Stockholm, and Jan M.

Police said they were maintaining a heightened presence, fearing copycat attacks. \n \n FLOWERS, DEFIANCE \n \n A gaping hole in the wall of the store showed the force of the impact from the truck, which was removed overnight for examination by forensics experts, and people gathered to pay their respects and leave flowers. \n \n Ahlens said it would open part of the store on Sunday. \n \n STOCKHOLM 2017-04-08 Police in central Stockholm near the crime scene on April 08, 2017, the day after a hijacked beer truck plowed into pedestrians on Drottninggatan and crashed into Ahlens department store on Friday, killing four people, injuring 15 others.

But some Swedes are having second thoughts after more than 160,000 people, many from Syria, applied for asylum in 2015 in a nation of just 10 million. \n \n Sweden has since tightened its borders and asylum numbers have slowed to a trickle.

We took care of everyone lying on the ground,\u201d he told Aftonbladet. \n \n Hasan Sidi, another passerby, told Aftonbladet he saw two elderly women lying on the ground. He said people at the scene urged him to help one of the women who was \u201cbleeding to death\u201d. Sidi said: \u201cOne of them died ... I don\u2019t know if the other one made it.\u201d \n \n Friday\u2019s attack was the latest in a string of similar assaults with vehicles in Europe, including in London, Berlin and Nice. \n \n The British prime minister, Theresa May, spoke with her Swedish counterpart on Saturday and offered to work together against extremist attacks. A Downing Street statement said May expressed her condolences on behalf of the British people in a telephone call to L\u00f6fven. \n \n The statement said the leaders agreed on the importance of working together to tackle such threats. In a similar attack on Westminster last month, Khalid Masood drove a rented SUV into pedestrians before running into the grounds of parliament where he stabbed a police officer to death.

Life must go on,\" Lofven said. \"We in Sweden want an open society.\" \"Terrorists want us to be afraid, want us to change our behaviour, want us to not live our lives normally, but that is what we're going to do,\" Lofven said. \"So terrorists can never defeat Sweden, never.\" There has been no claim of responsibility for the attack, though ISIS claimed similar attacks in cities including London and Nice, reports Reuters.",

    "document": "Papa John's isn't pulling any punches with its first new advertisement since its founder John Schnatter was ousted as chairman last month. \n \n On Friday, the beleaguered pizza chain published a video on social media that addressed outrage customers expressed following comments made by Schnatter in November about the National Football League and, more recently, his use of the N-word on a conference call that came to light in July. \n \n \"You expected better from Papa John's,\" says the video, which was posted on Facebook and Twitter Friday afternoon. \"So did we.\" \n \n The video contains actual customer Tweets that call out the pizza chain over Schnatter's remarks and demand Papa John's change its policies if it wants their business back. \n \n \"Right now, we're reviewing our culture from top to bottom and meeting with our communities to learn how we can be better,\" the company wrote on Twitter. \"We fully intend to earn back your trust through action.\" ||||| Papa John's is confronting its crisis: Customers think it has a racism problem. \n \n In a new ad, the pizza chain shows some of the furious messages it received after its founder blamed NFL protests for poor sales and later admitted using the N-word. \n \n \"Racism is disgusting and I won't support it,\" one person wrote. Another said that \"blaming players for poor sales with dog whistle racism was a hack move.\" \n \n Between the messages, words from the company appear on the screen. \n \n \"You expected better from Papa John's. So did we,\" the company writes. \"Thank you for your honesty ... It is making us better.\" \n \n Papa John's is struggling with declining sales, especially since founder John Schnatter was forced to resign as chairman in July, after his use of the slur came to light. \n \n Schnatter has since said it was a mistake to resign, and is now attacking CEO Steve Ritchie in an apparent bid to regain control. \n \n The ads recall those put out by Facebook (FB), Uber and Wells Fargo (WFC) after PR crises at those companies. All of those ads acknowledged customer concerns, although with varying degrees of directness. \n \n The company has taken great pains to distance itself from Schnatter, removing his image from marketing materials, kicking him out of his office and trying to stop him from gaining more control of the company. \n \n \"The video produced by the Company represents another example of the Company attempting to hide the true facts,\" a spokesman for Schnatter said in a statement. He added that fans have called for Schnatter's return to the company. \n \n Papa John's also announced Friday that it will roll out mandatory bias training for its workers. \n \n Training will start in October at the corporate office and at corporate-owned stores, which make up about 20% of its the chain's US restaurants. The Papa John's leadership team finished their own training two weeks ago. \n \n The program will include conversations about unconscious bias, racial and cultural sensitivity and managing bias. \n \n In an open letter, Ritchie said Papa John's is also conducting an internal audit on diversity and inclusion practices, launching a program to support minority-owned franchises and starting a foundation focused on local communities. \n \n Ritchie said he was \"personally committed to adding more diversity to the leadership team of Papa John's.\" \n \n Papa John's has hired Bank of America and Lazard to help stabilize the business, a source told CNNMoney on Friday. The source declined to give further details, and Bank of America and Lazard declined to comment. The news was reported earlier by Reuters. \n \n Papa John's also seems to be following a similar playbook to that of Starbucks (SBUX), which mandated anti-bias training after two black men were arrested while waiting for a friend at a Philadelphia location. \n \n Starbucks closed about 8,000 stores for an afternoon to conduct the elaborate training, which tapped the musician and activist Common as a virtual session leader and relied on the guidance of more than 30 experts. ||||| Tweet with a location \n \n You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

As the new CEO, I want to share the values that will drive the transformation of Papa John\u2019s. \n \n I started my career in the pizza business 25 years ago because pizza brings people together. I found a home at Papa John\u2019s where people from all backgrounds work side-by-side every day. Papa John\u2019s is 120,000 corporate and franchise team members around the world. We stand for equity, fairness, respect and opportunity. Our most important ingredient is our people. \n \n When I became CEO in January, diversity, equity and inclusion became one of my top priorities. What began as a committee of passionate team members has grown into a company-wide effort to realize our values. Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve done so far: \n \n An independent cultural audit and investigation of our diversity and inclusion practices is underway, with actionable recommendations to follow. \n \n I, along with other Papa John\u2019s leaders, visited Atlanta, Los Angeles, Dallas, Detroit and Chicago as part of a listening tour to get feedback from team members and franchisees on how we can do better. \n \n Recently, the Papa John\u2019s leadership team completed unconscious bias training. We will be rolling out the program across the company. \n \n I am personally committed to adding more diversity to the leadership team of Papa John\u2019s. \n \n We\u2019re assembling a special advisory group comprised of nationally-respected diversity, equity and inclusion experts to help guide us. \n \n We\u2019re kicking off the development of two key long-term initiatives: The Papa John\u2019s minority-owned franchise expansion and development program; and Formation of a new foundation that will be focused on making a positive impact in communities where our team members live and work.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 \"I'd rather have frozen pizza than racist pizza.\" So reads a customer tweet about Papa John's, and it's not one the pizza company is shying away from. Quite the contrary, the message is highlighted in the chain's first new ad since John Schnatter was forced to resign last month over his use of the n-word. In the 65-second ad posted to social media Friday, a series of angry tweets are displayed, then the words, \"You expected better from Papa John's. So did we.\" Then, after showing more tweets, the words \"Thank you for your anger\" appear. That last word is subsequently replaced with \"criticism\" and \"honesty.\" \"It is making us better.\" CEO Steve Ritchie also posted extensive comments on Twitter, which you can read here, and a letter to customers, which you can read here. CNN reports the company plans to hold mandatory bias training sessions beginning in October at its company-owned stores and is going live with a minority-owned franchise expansion and development program. The ad certainly hasn't abated Schnatter's anger.

    "document": "Muhummad Iqbal, who is demanding justice after his pregnant second wife was killed by her family, admits his own crime \n \n A Pakistani man demanding justice after his pregnant wife was murdered outside Lahore's high court this week admitted on Thursday to strangling his first wife, in an admission that is likely to focus even more attention on the prevalence of so-called \"honour\" killings in the country. \n \n Muhummad Iqbal, the 45-year-old husband of Farzana Parveen, who was beaten to death by 20 male relatives on Tuesday, said he strangled his first wife in order to marry Parveen. \n \n He avoided a prison sentence after his family used Islamic provisions of Pakistan's legal system to forgive him, precisely those he has insisted should not be available to his wife's killers. \n \n \"I was in love with Farzana and killed my first wife because of this love,\" he told Agence France-Presse. \n \n Police confirmed that the killing had happened six years ago and that he was released after a \"compromise\" with his family. \n \n Iqbal has also claimed that Parveen's family killed another one of their daughters some years ago. Speaking to a researcher from the Aurat Foundation, a women's rights organisation, he claimed that Parveen's father, Muhammad Azeem, had poisoned the other woman after falling out with her husband-in-law. \n \n The foundation has been unable to confirm Iqbal's claim about a second killing. \n \n The extraordinary twists to the affair came after Pakistan's prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, ordered an urgent investigation into the killing of Parveen, a woman who had enraged her family after marrying without their consent. \n \n In a statement he said the crime was \"totally unacceptable and must be dealt with in accordance with the law promptly\". \n \n He also ordered the chief minister of Punjab province, his younger brother Shahbaz Sharif, to take immediate action and launch an urgent investigation. \n \n The deadly attack on Parveen, which reportedly lasted for around 15 minutes, began soon after she and Iqbal arrived at the court where she was due to testify against her father's claim that she had been kidnapped and coerced into marriage. \n \n Her father, who is the only one of the group to be have been arrested so far, told police that his daughter had been killed because he had dishonoured her family. \n \n Iqbal has claimed that Parveen's father only withdrew his support for their marriage after demanding more money than had initially been agreed at the start of a long engagement. Sharif's intervention followed international uproar, including a lengthy and stinging condemnation from the UN high commissioner for human rights, Navi Pillay, who said Pakistan must take \"urgent and strong measures to put an end to the continuous stream of so-called 'honour killings' and other forms of violence against women\". \n \n She said: \"The fact that she was killed on her way to court shows a serious failure by the state to provide security for someone who \u2013 given how common such killings are in Pakistan \u2013 was obviously at risk.\" \n \n The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said that the media had reported that nearly 900 women had been killed in \"honour\" crimes in 2013 alone, but the actual figure is likely to be far higher. \n \n Until Thursday there had been little comment on the case domestically, with newspapers and television stations focussing on other stories. \n \n One journalist, an editor of an Urdu national paper who did not want to be named, said the country's media reflected its audience. \n \n \"Although we have some educated people, most are still living in semi-tribal societies in far-flung rural areas,\" he said. \"In a country where people are being killed every day by miscreants and militants it is not so important when one woman is killed by one husband.\" \n \n Some members of the public in Lahore clearly share the media's ambivalence. \n \n Muhammad Yaqub, a student at a private university in the city, said he understood the loss of honour for the family but disliked the brutal way the woman had been killed. \n \n \"He did some right and some wrong,\" he said. ||||| Story highlights Husband of slain woman says he killed his first wife \n \n Pakistani Prime Minister orders full report on the killing \n \n Farzana Parveen, 3 months pregnant, was stoned Tuesday in a public area of a big city \n \n Her father, brothers and cousins participated in the stoning \n \n The husband of Farzana Parveen, the Pakistani woman stoned to death for refusing to participate in an arranged marriage, told CNN he killed his first wife so he could marry Parveen. \n \n Authorities said the first wife was killed six years ago. \n \n \"I wanted to send a proposal to Farzana, so I killed my wife,\" Mohammad Iqbal said Thursday in an interview with CNN. \n \n Zulfiqar Hameed, district inspector general for the Punjab police, said Iqbal's son from the first marriage alerted police to the slaying six years ago. \n \n Iqbal was arrested but later released on bail because his son forgave him, Hameed said. \n \n JUST WATCHED Fighting honor killings in Muslim world Replay More Videos ...

MUST WATCH Human rights activist speaks on violence 01:20 \n \n The son, Aurengzeb, who is in his 20s, confirmed his father's statements to CNN. He said his father served a year in jail. \n \n Parveen, who was three months pregnant, was beaten to death with bricks Tuesday in the eastern city of Lahore by a group of about 20 people, including her brothers, father and cousin, police said. Police have arrested Parveen's father and are searching for the other killers in this all-too-common crime. \n \n Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has requested that Punjab's chief minister, Shahbaz Sharif, submit a report on the incident. \n \n The United Nations estimates 5,000 women are murdered worldwide by family members each year in \"honor killings,\" so named because the woman's actions are considered to have brought shame on her family. But women's advocacy groups say the crime is underreported and the figure could be around 20,000 a year. \n \n \"Most 'honor' crimes can be traced to inflexible and discriminatory attitudes about women's roles, especially around sexuality,\" said Rothna Begum of Human Rights Watch. \"Women or couples seen as having brought 'dishonor' on the community face violence, which is then held out as a chilling example for others.\" \n \n Most honor killings in the Middle East and Central Asia occur in rural areas. Tuesday's attack was unusual because it happened in a public area of a big city. \n \n Iqbal, a neighbor of Parveen's family, said he and Parveen were supposed to marry, with the family's approval, last year. As part of the arrangement, Iqbal said, he'd given Parveen's father 80,000 rupees and gold jewelry. \n \n Last December, Parveen's mother died and her father and brothers changed their minds about the marriage, Iqbal said. \n \n The family decided Parveen, who came from a village in Punjab, should marry a cousin, police said. \n \n Parveen, 25, and Iqbal eloped and were married January 7 in a court ceremony. He said she liked the color white and that she was a \"beautiful and good wife.\" \n \n \"We were happy,\" he said, though they were constantly worried about their safety. \n \n \"She loved us,\" said Aurengzeb, Parveen's stepson. \"She always made the most delicious meat stew for us.\" \n \n The marriage enraged her family, Iqbal said, and they demanded he pay them 100,000 rupees (about $1,000) to let the couple stay alive. \n \n Iqbal, a farmer in the village in Jurranwala, Punjab, didn't have the money. \n \n The family had challenged Parveen's marriage to Iqbal in the courts, accusing him of abducting her. \n \n \"They left my office around 7:40 a.m.,\" the lawyer, Rai Ghulam Mustafa, said. \"They arrived at the main gate of the High Court around 7:45 a.m. The opposite party, the family members of Farzana Parveen, had been lying in wait for her among the cars. They suddenly attacked her, repeatedly hit her with bricks and killed her.\" \n \n One family member made a noose of rough cloth around her neck while her brothers smashed bricks into her skull, said Mushtaq Ahmed, a police official, citing the preliminary report on the killing. \n \n Iqbal witnessed the attack and tried to protest, but was held back. \n \n Police said they had arrested Parveen's father, whose name they gave only as Azeem. They said he had admitted to the killing and expressed no regret. \n \n Senior Police Officer Umar Cheema told CNN that law enforcement agents are conducting raids in areas near the village to find the other killers. \n \n Iqbal said nobody helped when the stoning began. People just stood around and watched. \n \n Farzana Bari, a human rights activist based in Islamabad, said in many cases people outside the family don't step in to protect the victim \"because it's a private matter.\" \n \n Bari said the number of honor killings is probably much higher than studies show because many families don't report the killings, and the killers often avoid prosecution. \n \n Under an Islamic element of Pakistani law, known as the law of Diyat, the family of a victim is allowed to forgive the perpetrator, according to the human rights commission's report. \n \n Lawyer Maliha Zia told CNN that \"blood money\" is also part of criminal law in Pakistan. \n \n In certain cases, when both parties agree to reach a financial settlement, the court can take the settlement into consideration instead of jail time. Also, the courts can order financial reparations instead of imprisonment, Zia said. \n \n Honor-based violence has been reported in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, Ecuador, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Iraq, Iran, Italy, Jordan, Morocco, Pakistan, Sweden, Turkey, Uganda, the United Kingdom and the United States, the U.N. said in a report titled \"Global Violence Against Women in the Name of 'Honour.'\" \n \n Hameed said Iqbal was on the run for several weeks after killing his first wife and eluded arrest, and those facts would be incorporated into the report on Parveen's killing.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The macabre story of the pregnant woman who was stoned to death by her own family on Tuesday in Pakistan just got far more twisted: Mohammad Iqbal has revealed to CNN that he murdered his first wife so he could wed Farzana Parveen. Officials confirm that his first wife was indeed killed, some six years ago; the Guardian reports she was strangled. Iqbal's 20-something son reportedly went to police after the killing, and Iqbal spent a number of weeks on the run before being arrested. The son says his father served a year in jail; police say he was freed after reaching a \"compromise\" with his family as allowed by Pakistani law. Iqbal says, \"I wanted to send a proposal to Farzana so I killed my wife.\" The timeline of the events remains a bit murky in terms of when Iqbal met Parveen, with the Guardian previously reporting the two were engaged for nearly two years before marrying this January. CNN does clarify some details about Iqbal and Parveen's involvement, per Iqbal: He says that the woman's mother died in December, and her father and brothers then changed their mind about the agreed-upon marriage, preferring she wed a cousin instead. The two opted to elope on Jan. 7, and her furious family demanded more money on top of what Iqbal had initially paid in exchange for their lives. Iqbal says his refusal to pay led to an abduction charge against him, and Parveen was planning to testify when she was attacked outside the court. According to a preliminary police report, her own brothers bashed her head with bricks.",

(Willow is Jaden\u2019s 12-year-old sister.) \n \n Jaden: She just knows who she is, so she just is. \n \n Will: She has a magic power in the family. She absolutely demands the most attention, and there\u2019s \u00adsomething really incendiary about a 12-year-old girl who says and does what she wants. \n \n You and Jaden have acted in two movies together, including After Earth. Are you planning on a third? \n \n Will: If you were a student of the pattern, you\u2019d have to say we\u2019re going to do another one. \n \n Jaden: I definitely would do another one, absolutely. You know, how Johnny Depp and Tim Burton always do movies together, Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio? We\u2019ll have a relationship like that. \n \n Do you think of that as a separate relationship from your father-son relationship? \n \n Jaden: It\u2019s kind of like father and son, except that we\u2019re both going to work together. [Points to his dad.] Like you worked in your family business with your dad. I\u2019m just working in my family business with my dad. Patterns, boom. \n \n \n \n Jaden, how was working with your father this time around different from before? \n \n Jaden: Well, with the first movie [Pursuit of Happyness], he was teaching me along the way. This is how the camera works. You do several takes. Like, literally everything you need to know about movies. And then, in Karate Kid, he was kind of holding my hand and watching me distill those rules. And then on After Earth, he was like, All right, you\u2019re an actor, I\u2019m an actor, let\u2019s make a movie together. So it was like a collaboration, you know what I\u2019m saying? \n \n What is your dynamic when the whole family is on the set? \n \n Jaden: Willow basically does her thing. [They both laugh.] Dad kind of just is there. He has to feel his own vibe. And my mom is probably like, \u201cUh-uh. Tell Jaden he needs to do this.\u201d \n \n Will: Yeah, Jada [Pinkett Smith] has really powerful insights and opinions about everything. \n \n You guys aren\u2019t that way? \n \n Jaden: If we\u2019re at a six, she\u2019s like at an eight and a half. Like, when she comes on set and she sees something that\u2019s not right, she says, \u201cThis needs to change, this needs to leave, this needs to happen.\u201d \n \n Will: Yeah, I probably had a couple of poor parenting moments on this movie. Do you know what a fer-de-lance is? \n \n Jaden: It\u2019s one of the most poisonous snakes in all of Costa Rica. \n \n Will: There were a couple of days where there was a high concentration of snakes [on the set]. \n \n Jaden: Fer-de-lances, not snakes! I was doing a scene, going through some tall grasses, and they said, \u201cHey, we caught some fer-de-lances around there, and there seems to be a lot more, and I think we should move the scene.\u201d I was like, \u201cHow many fer-de-lances did you catch?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cEight.\u201d \n \n Will: I said, \u201cWell, you got them all, so it\u2019s fine. Let\u2019s just shoot it.\u201d Yeah, if Mommy was there, that wouldn\u2019t have gone down. As an actor, I felt like it was an authentic experience of actually being in Costa Rica. I learned it in Ali, man, when you actually have to go to the place and you take the flight and you are actually in the authentic space, it adds to your performance. \n \n Jaden, how does it feel to be famous? \n \n Jaden: I think it\u2019s fun, except when people make up stuff about you. Then it\u2019s not so much fun. But besides that, I enjoy it. \n \n It\u2019s been reported that you might be dating Kylie Jenner. The Kardashians have treated their fame as the family business. Do you guys see yourselves as similar or different? [Will, laughing, holds up his hand for Jaden not to speak.] \n \n Jaden: I\u2019m trying to understand. \n \n Will: Don\u2019t. You know, he\u2019s never had to, to deal with those kinds of questions. \n \n Well, forget the Kardashians \u2026 maybe you could just \u2026 \n \n Will: [Mimicking] \u201cSo how do you think your life is similar or un-similar to people\u2019s names in Calabasas?\u201d For our family, the entire structure of our life, our home, our business relationships\u2014the entire purpose is for everyone to be able to create in a way that makes them happy. Fame is almost an inconsequential by-product of what we\u2019re really trying to accomplish. We are trying to put great things into the world, we\u2019re trying to have fun, and we\u2019re trying to become the greatest versions of ourselves in the process of doing things we love. So the idea of fame or exploitation or orchestrating the media is sometimes even less than desirable for us. \n \n Do you think Jaden could have been a dentist? \n \n Will: It may seem like we have pushed our kids into the business, but that is absolutely insane. I would never, ever, push somebody to have their face on a poster that\u2019s going be everywhere in the world. He is making a choice from the informed. It\u2019s less scary to me than if he wanted to be a dentist in that I couldn\u2019t help with what he\u2019d chosen. I have relationships with some of the biggest filmmakers and actors and producers on Earth. So I can be a huge help. \n \n Willow chose singing and then un-chose it. She said, \u201cDaddy, I want to go to school with my friends during the week, and I want to hang out with them on the weekends.\u201d At the peak of \u201cWhip My Hair,\u201d she\u2019s like, \u201cDaddy, I\u2019m done.\u201d I was like, \u201cWow, wow, wow. No, baby, I got Annie [the upcoming movie remake, co-produced by Jay-Z], you know. It\u2019ll be New York, you\u2019ll be with Beyonc\u00e9. You can bring your friends.\u201d And she said, \u201cDaddy, I got a better idea. How about I just be 12?\u201d At the end of the day, it has to be their choice. \n \n So maybe Jaden could have been a dentist, but he probably couldn\u2019t sit in his room doing nothing all day. \n \n Jaden: Probably not. \n \n Will: I think it was in Edward \u00adKennedy\u2019s autobiography, he said that he hadn\u2019t found his way in his life, and his father sat down with him and said, We are a family that are trying to have valuable lives. You are allowed to decide whether or not you want your life to be valuable to the world, and I respect that decision. I\u2019m just not going to have a lot of time for you. Essentially that is my position with my children. You can choose anything that you want to do, anything you want to be, and you can decide you want to act crazy and run around. I respect your ability to choose a life for yourself that does not have value to the world. I respect that. I\u2019m just not going have a lot of time for you. \n \n In the past, Jada has described the family as transparent. Do you think that\u2019s true? \n \n Jaden: Definitely. \n \n Will: Let me see. Are we transparent? \n \n Jaden: You can argue that we\u2019re extremely un-transparent. Everybody knows where we live, but nobody really knows what our house looks like. \n \n Will: That\u2019s true. \n \n Jaden: We kind of live in a fortress. \n \n Will: I think for the most part we are transparent in the sense that there\u2019s very few big family secrets. I think that if Jaden or Trey [Will\u2019s son from his first marriage] or Willow were to write a book ten years from now, it will be very similar to what people think. And, the things about our family that are mysteries or seem strange, when they\u2019re explained, it\u2019ll be obvious. You know, the forum of media that we\u2019re in can\u2019t really handle the complexity of things that we say all the time. \n \n What would be an example? \n \n Will: I did an interview where the only quote that everybody ran was \u201cWill Smith doesn\u2019t believe in punishment.\u201d Well, that\u2019s actually ridiculous. That\u2019s not what I said, but the sound bite can\u2019t actually hold the complexity of what I\u2019m trying to say, you know. That there is a destructive aspect to corporal punishment that I don\u2019t agree with. There are concepts and ideas about punishment that I think run counter to healthy growth and psychological stability in this world. But they just take one blurb. \n \n Jaden: They\u2019re always gonna do that. \n \n Will: Yeah. What\u2019s the blurb gonna be from this one? [Laughs] But for the most part I think we are very transparent, or maybe not transparent, but boring. \n \n You think you\u2019re boring? \n \n Will: I think that if you were to come to the house, people would really be \u00adsurprised at how simple and basic it is. Our whole dream for our home was for it to be an artist\u2019s haven. So there are paint supplies; there\u2019s a piano with a microphone and a recorder right there to capture things right in the second. There\u2019s editing equipment. There are cameras. I think the only thing in our house that people would be surprised by is the efficiency. \n \n Like staffing? \n \n Will: No, just how serious we are about how the microphone at the piano has to be on and the recorder has to be ready to go for when somebody gets an idea. The paint supplies have got to be kept up\u2014you know, you cannot go to paint something and a color\u2019s empty. \n \n Is it true that you alphabetized your laser discs? \n \n Will: Yeah, I\u2019m very, very serious about systems supporting creative inspiration. \n \n In the movie, Jaden, your character calls his dad \u201cSir.\u201d Is that the dynamic with you guys? \n \n Jaden: In real life, no. It\u2019s like how it is right now. \n \n How is it right now? \n \n Jaden: It\u2019s hard for me to explain because it\u2019s so normal to me. It\u2019s like \u00adasking, \u201cSo, Jaden, how do you breathe?\u201d He\u2019s, like, really just cool. He lets us have our freedom as long as we can control our freedom. \n \n In After Earth, the father is a general who is injured and has to watch his son fight for his life. Was this a metaphor for what it\u2019s like sending your kid into Hollywood? \n \n Will: Absolutely. That\u2019s what I wanted the metaphor of this movie to be. A father having to watch as his son makes mistakes in the world, and in an extreme place of life or death. It is the excruciating parental pain of having to let your kids go, and you just have to hope that the lessons you\u2019ve instilled will kick in at the right time. \n \n Will, what kind of relationship did you have with your father? \n \n Will: You know, I grew up where you got the hospital corners on the beds. I grew up with old-school rules where you speak when you\u2019re spoken to. There were hugely powerful ideas about discipline and spirituality. \n \n You were baptized. \n \n Will: Baptized. Went to a Catholic school. Lived in a Jewish neighborhood. \n \n My mother worked on the school board, so she was very serious about education, and my grandmother was in the church. So there was a huge amount of discipline, and I\u2019m trying to maintain some of the old ideals, minus the ownership. We don\u2019t own our children, you know. They own themselves. Not to go too far into that, talking about slavery concepts and how the black community is carrying those \u2026 \n \n Jaden: If we started going down that road, Mommy would, like, burst into this room. \n \n In terms of mistakes, Will, early on in your career you had a period of years where most of your wages were garnished for not paying taxes. Have you educated Jaden about all the money he\u2019s making? \n \n Will: Yeah, you know, we met with \u00adRobert Kiyosaki, the author of Rich Dad, Poor Dad, and we\u2019re trying to design a \u00adcurriculum for children to understand even the basic connection between a bank and capitalism. I mean, I\u2019m very serious with my kids about them comprehending the intricacies of global finance. \n \n Is it hard to educate your kids to be responsible about money when they grew up with wealth? \n \n Will: It\u2019s funny. Willow and Trey went in completely the opposite direction. Like, Willow only shops at Target. Jaden is really the only one of my kids that has a little bit of a taste for, uh \u2026 \n \n Jaden: I like Cartier. \n \n Will: That\u2019s a little new. \n \n Jaden: The Cartier is new, but before that it was Louis [Vuitton]. \n \n Will: Yes, he has a little bit of a taste. But he connects his responsibility to working and creating to the fun that he enjoys with the finer things. \n \n So, Jaden, you like spending the money you earn? \n \n Jaden: Well, when you say it like that, not really. There was a time in my life when I\u2019d go to Cartier, like, every weekend for like a month. But, now I\u2019m \u2026 \n \n What would you buy? \n \n Jaden: I have four rings I\u2019m not wearing today. I haven\u2019t bought anything that expensive in a really long time. The only thing I buy is, like, food and skateboards. \n \n Will: Once he started approving his own bank statements and credit cards and all, yeah, he changed. \n \n I heard that you and Jada were going to write a book together? \n \n Will: It feels like you can\u2019t write books in progress. \n \n Jaden: Give them ten years. They\u2019ll drop a book every year. \n \n You feel like they have a lot to say? \n \n Jaden: Yes, like 900 pages, both of them, so it\u2019ll be like two books a year. He drops his book, she drops her book. \n \n Will: Our kids get an earful around the house just on every topic, every subject. \n \n Jaden: If I\u2019m with my friends, and they\u2019ll be like, \u201cOh, hey, where\u2019s your dad? Let\u2019s go say hi.\u201d And I\u2019ll be like, \u201cOh, no. He\u2019s watching hours and hours of TED Talks just \u2026 Dude, don\u2019t go in there.\u201d Last time I went in there, he said, \u201cJaden, so the art of telling stories is an art that you really have to learn. I want you to read Aesop\u2019s Fables.\u201d \u201cDad, I\u2019ve read Aesop\u2019s Fables three times.\u201d \u201cHonestly, you can\u2019t read it enough.\u201d But when you\u2019re on your way to see a 9:15 movie and it\u2019s nine o\u2019clock, he\u2019s like, \u201cWait, wait, Jaden, I need to tell you something about life, man.\u201d \n \n *This article originally appeared in the June 3, 2013 issue of New York Magazine. ||||| Everyone knows you rarely learn much by reading interviews with movie stars. It's a less commonplace experience, though, to feel yourself becoming actively less well-informed as you read, as if the celebrity's words were eliminating your brain-cells, one by one, like bubble-wrap being popped. Yet take a look, if you dare, at this Q&A, in the current edition of New York magazine, with Will Smith and his son Jaden, to promote their forthcoming film After Earth. It should definitely win some kind of award, though I'm not sure the relevant Pulitzer category has been created yet. \n \n Smith senior is, of course, one half of the uber-powerful Hollywood couple who insist they're not Scientologists but who do give money to groups affiliated with Scientology and who did set up a private elementary school that deploys teaching methods formulated by L Ron Hubbard. Here, he claims not to be religious (though a few years ago he described himself as a Christian) and explains that, anyway, his real worldview is all about \"patterns\": \n \n I'm a student of patterns. At heart, I'm a physicist. I look at everything in my life as trying to find the single equation, the theory of everything. \n \n It's just a tiny bit unclear what Smith means by a \"pattern\": the two examples he endorses in the interview are a) that the sun rises every morning and b) that the Best Actor Oscar tends to be awarded to people portraying historical figures or characters with mental illness. One can also use patterns, Smith informs the interviewer, Claire Hoffman, to predict whether he will make another movie alongside his son: \n \n \n \n If you were a student of the pattern, you'd have to say we were going to do another one. \n \n \n \n Wait: \"the pattern\"? Is there one pattern, or are there many? I'm confused, but that's probably because mainstream media like New York magazine can't fully accommodate the profundity of Smith's thought: \n \n You know, the forum of media that we're in can't really handle the complexity of things that we say all the time. \n \n One feels inclined to cut Jaden Smith some slack, since he's only 14 and has been raised by Will Smith. But it ought to be noted that his contributions to the emerging Smith theory of everything are in many ways more mindwarping than his father's: \n \n Jaden: I think that there is that special equation for everything, but I don't think our mathematics have evolved enough for us to even \u2013 I think there's, like, a whole new mathematics that we'd have to learn to get that equation. \n \n Will: I agree with that. \n \n Jaden: It's beyond mathematical. It's, like, multidimensional mathematical, if you can sort of understand what I'm saying. \n \n \n \n I sort of can't, actually! But never mind. As Jaden \u2013 who has reportedly announced his desire to become an emancipated minor, free of parental control, when he turns 15 \u2013 explains about his mother, Jada Pinkett Smith: \n \n If we're at a six, she's like at an eight and a half. \n \n \u2026whereas I'm probably more like a one or a two, so my confusion is understandable. (On what scale, you ask? We never learn.) \n \n What to make of all this? It certainly demonstrates just how loopy your uncontrolled speculations can become when you're insulated, through fame and wealth, from people pointing out that they make no sense. Other than that, I'm fairly certain there are absolutely no conclusions to be drawn from it whatsoever. Sorry. Our mathematics just hasn't evolved sufficiently yet. \n \n If you wonder where Smith is getting all this from, by the way, Jaden gives a hint at the end: \n \n He's watching hours and hours of TED talks\u2026 \n \n Ah, well, there you go.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Here's how Guardian writer Oliver Burkeman describes a recent interview given by Will and Jaden Smith: \"the most bizarre interview in Hollywood history,\" and one that \"will make your brain hurt.\" The Q&A in question appeared in New York a few days ago, as the father and son promoted their new movie After Earth. Here's a relevant excerpt: Will: \"I\u2019m a student of patterns. At heart, I\u2019m a physicist. I look at everything in my life as trying to find the single equation, the theory of everything.\" Jaden: \"There's definitely a theory to everything. ...

It\u2019s, like, multidimensional mathematical, if you can sort of understand what I\u2019m saying.\" Will, later: \"And, the things about our family that are mysteries or seem strange, when they\u2019re explained, it\u2019ll be obvious. You know, the forum of media that we\u2019re in can\u2019t really handle the complexity of things that we say all the time.\" If you're thinking, \"Well, what do you expect, they're Scientologists,\" not so fast. In the same interview, the elder Smith says they're not religious, but are \"students of world religion\" and \"respect all [religions].\" He has flat-out denied being a Scientologist in the past. (As for After Earth ... it got hilariously terrible reviews.)",

But any real notions of democracy end with the name. \n \n North Koreans headed to the polls at the weekend to cast their ballots in elections for local representatives on provincial, city, and county People's Assemblies. \n \n Citizens were not asked to make a choice -- the results had already been decided by Kim Jong Un's central government. \n \n Voters were handed ballot papers but didn't mark them. They would have instead deposited them in a ballot box, signifying their support for the pre-approved candidates. \n \n Defector Kim Kwang-jin explained that their most important job is to show up. \n \n Read More ||||| North Korea's state-controlled elections saw a 99.97% voter turnout on Sunday, with only those absent from the country not participating, state media reported. \n \n Almost the entire country reportedly made it to the polls, including the elderly and ill, who cast their votes through \"mobile ballot boxes\" for uncontested candidates carefully selected by the ruling party. \n \n North Korea's Supreme Leader Kim Jong-Un, who exercises complete control over the country's 24.9 million citizens, was also seen casting his ballot in the capital, Pyongyang. \n \n The elections were Mr Kim's first at a local level since he inherited the position in 2011, with voters reportedly \"singing and dancing\" as they cast their vote at polling stations \"clad in a festive atmosphere\". \n \n Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency said: \"All participants took part in the elections with extraordinary enthusiasm to cement the revolutionary power through the elections of deputies to the local people's assemblies\". \n \n Play video \"North Korea: Single Party State\" Video: North Korea: Single Party State \n \n Local elections are held every four years and voters choose mayors, local assemblies and governors, who meet twice a year to approve budgets and endorse leaders that have been approved by the ruling party. \n \n In the 2011 elections, which also saw a 99.97% voter participation rate, 28,116 representatives were elected as deputies without a single vote of opposition. \n \n Ballot papers only present one candidate to choose from, which has been overseen by Mr Kim's Workers' Party, and any dissenting votes are considered acts of treason. \n \n The elections have been denounced as an effort by North Korea to appear democratic, but are also an opportunity for the government to see if any established names are absent and to oust any dissident behaviour. \n \n South Korean intelligence says that dozens of North Korean officials have been purged since Mr Kim took power in 2011, including his once powerful uncle, Jang Song-Thaek, who was condemned as \"factionalist scum\" following his execution in 2013. \n \n The results of the election are expected to be officially announced early next week. ||||| VOTERS in North Korea will go to the polls on March 9th to elect deputies to the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly (SPA), whose members are chosen every five years. Yes, that\u2019s right\u2014the totalitarian communist dynasty of North Korea holds elections. But they are, like a lot of things in North Korea, rather unusual. In fact they are not really elections at all. \n \n For one thing, \u201cvoters\u201d do not have much choice. They are presented with a single candidate in the district where they live. These candidates are chosen by the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland, the governing coalition, which is controlled by the Workers' Party. There is only one box to tick. Abstaining or voting no would be a dangerous act of treason, given that voting takes place in booths that do not provide any secrecy, and dissenting votes must be posted into a separate ballot box. In this way the population (everyone over 17 is obliged to vote) endorses the 687 deputies in the SPA, a body that, in any case, is merely a rubber-stamp parliament that is rarely convened. In practice the supreme leader, Kim Jong Un, calls the shots, supported by the Presidium, a smaller group of senior officials. \n \n Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mr Kim, who became supreme leader in 2011 after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, is standing as a candidate in this year\u2019s SPA elections. North Korea\u2019s news agency says his selection as a candidate was an expression of \u201cabsolute support and profound trust\u201d in his leadership. But Mr Kim may use the election to reshape the SPA more widely. Previous elections have been used as opportunities to change North Korea\u2019s constitution and adjust its power structure, something Mr Kim may be particularly keen to do having executed his uncle, Jang Sung Taek, long the country\u2019s number two, in December. At the same time, elections serve as a form of census, because voting is organised by residential unit. Updating its electoral records gives the government an opportunity to check up on the populace and make sure they are living where they are supposed to (and have not, say, defected to China). \n \n The whole process highlights an odd thing about sham or rigged elections held in autocratic countries. It seems that even the most despotic leaders (and they do not come much more despotic than Mr Kim) feel the need to pay democracy the back-handed compliment of imitating its outward appearance, if not its underlying political model. North Korea's leaders seem to take their pantomime polls seriously. Mr Kim is standing in constituency number 111, whereas his father stood in number 333; both numbers are said to bring luck. Based on past experience, the Kims tend not to need it. \n \n Dig deeper: \n \n The day The Economist was invited to North Korea to explain the Big Mac Index (June 2013) \n \n How democracy ran into trouble, and how it can be revived (March 2014) \n \n Parallel worlds: a special report on North and South Korea (October 2013) ||||| If you\u2019re a North Korean citizen trying to make an (underground) living in China, there\u2019s one event that will certainly bring you back home: election day in the DRPK, when many flood back into the country to have their votes counted whenever they are called. \n \n Why? According to defector Mina Yoon, who left North Korea in 2011, elections function mainly as a means for the state to keep track of its population\u2019s whereabouts and to keep track of defectors. \n \n \u201cThe government checks the list of voters and if your name is not on the list, they will investigate it\u201d, she told NK News. \u201cIt is often during election that the government finds out about defectors and people who have been missed\u201d. \n \n Since the collapse of the state\u2019s public distribution system during the famine of the mid-1990s, Yoon said, old ways of keeping track of citizens no longer work. While before citizens\u2019 movements were monitored and reported on by the head of their local inminban (North Korea\u2019s official neighborhood busybodies, who keep watch over their communities), now \u201cpeople move to other areas to do businesses without pass, there is no way for the head to check them\u201d. \n \n However, when election day rolls around, everything changes: \u201cSince people have to register one month before the election starts, those who left town for the business should come back\u201d, Yoon said. \n \n If the state realises you did not turn up to vote, you and your family are in trouble. \n \n \u201cDefectors in China come back to North Korea risking their lives because they are afraid of possible damages to their family or loved ones left in North Korea when the government figures out that they are missing\u201d, Yoon said. \n \n \u201cIf the state realises you did not turn up to vote, you and your family are in trouble\u201d \n \n Many, she said, return to China after the election and will come back yet again for the next election, saying, \u201cThose who got used to the life in China, which is better than the one in North Korea, they tend to escape again\u201d. \n \n Yoon, who participated in elections in North Korea, told NK News that most people aren\u2019t even aware of who their local candidate is, but are obligated vote or \u201cthere will be consequences such as being politically criticized or restricted\u201d. \n \n North Koreans also vote to be perceived as loyal citizens, pointing out that \u201cthey will be considered as rebellions otherwise. People tend to be more cautious about their behavior during election because when you\u2019re caught on any kind of illegal activity during an election, there will be additional punishment\u201d. \n \n A STACKED DECK \n \n Only one candidate may appear on the ballot in North Korean elections: the candidate endorsed by the local branch of the Workers\u2019 Party at mass meetings across the country. It is indeed possible for voters to vote \u201cno\u201d, crossing out a candidates name on the ballot paper. But this act of defiance is unthinkable, requiring the voter to go a special booth to cross out the name. Since, as Yoon said, elections are when North Koreans monitor each other the closest and are tested for their loyalty, not endorsing the official candidate makes you a prime candidate for a concentration camp. \n \n To understand how, and why North Korea votes, one must understand how the North Korean political system functions and the structure of its leadership. \n \n \u201cMany people don\u2019t know that North Korea actually has three other political factions sitting in its legislature\u201d \n \n While it is often said that the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea is the only party in North Korea\u2019s one-party state, many people don\u2019t know that North Korea actually has three other political factions sitting in its legislature, all making up the ruling \u201cDemocratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland\u201d. \n \n The first is the Korean Social Democratic Party, founded in 1945, \u201cout of the masses\u2019 anti-imperialist, anti-feudal aspirations and demands to eliminate the aftermath of the Japanese imperialist military rule and build a new democratic society\u201d \u2013 it boasts 50 seats in the Supreme Assembly. \n \n The second is the Chondoist Chongu Party, which holds 22 seats, and is a faction representing followers of the Cheondoist religious sect \u2013 an unusual synthesis of Taoist, Buddhist and Confucian thought with roots in 19th century and Korea\u2019s peasantry. An article on the Naenara website, an information service run by the North Korea government, said its goal is to \u201cestablish harmony among all members of society\u201d. \n \n Another faction with seats in the Supreme Assembly is the mysterious General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, a strange group based in Tokyo with strong connections with the DPRK, even serving as the country\u2019s de facto embassy for Japan. Five officials of the organisation sit in the Supreme Assembly. \n \n How much power does the North Korean Supreme Assembly actually have? Not much. While it is North Korea\u2019s primary legislative body, it largely delegated power to the much more influential Presidium, the highest organ of power in North Korea. The Presidium is designed to take legislative responsibility when the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly is not in session \u2013 which is almost every day of the year. \n \n Andrei Lankov, a professor of Asian Studies at Kookmin University, tells NK News that elections in the DPRK are largely the product of an electoral system transplanted from the Soviet Union during the Cold War, with the North Korean system being close to identical to the system introduced in the USSR: one candidate per ballot, endorsed by a coalition of the Communist Party and subservient \u201cnon-party\u201d members. \n \n As in North Korea, Lankov said, the authorities \u201cclaimed improbably high levels of participation (always above 99 percent), as well as improbably high levels of approval for official candidates (99.8 percent in 1984 Supreme Soviet election, for example)\u201d. \n \n \u201cThe North Korean electoral system was copied from the Soviet Union\u201d, he continues, \u201cbut some comic (or rather tragicomic) features of the Soviet system were taken to extremes. After the 1957 elections North Korea made the system still more peculiar: they began to claim 100 percent participation rates and 100 percent approval rates. People used to joke that on the day of elections that no one would dare to die in North Korea, let alone lose consciousness\u201d. \n \n THE BIG DAY \n \n A North Korean election day itself has a strict itinerary. Eligible voters are herded along to their local polling station by the head of their inminban, which has a list of all those registered in the district. \n \n The voters then arrive in voting booths, with posters saying, \u201clet\u2019s all vote for the candidate\u201d, and watched over by portraits of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. Next, Lankov said, \u201cVoters pay a deep bow to the latter (this is of course obligatory), and then they take a ballot (every ballot has only one name of course)\u201d. \n \n Perhaps unsurprisingly, elections in North Korea are not seen as an opportunity for the populace to express their views, and North Koreans know next to nothing about what they actually mean. \n \n \u201cElections in North Korea are not seen as an opportunity for the populace to express their views\u201d \n \n \u201cThe North does not teach students about the importance of the election when they were in the middle school or high school\u201d, defector Jihoon Park told NK News. \u201cTherefore, we can say North Korean people have no idea about the right to vote\u201d. \n \n With the absence of liberal conceptions of how an election works, elections in North Korea seem much more an opportunity for the regime to flex its patriotic muscles, with Yoon describing elections rallies as \u201cpropaganda advertisement\u201d. \u201cThe government\u201d, she said \u201cmakes people gather at a plaza and shout slogans such as \u2018let\u2019s drive out U.S. armies from South Korea\u2019\u201d. \n \n While it\u2019s impossible to know what North Koreans think while they\u2019re in the voting booth, it\u2019s likely that they see it either a great patriotic duty or just another mundane duty among the endless duties required of them by the state. \n \n NORTH KOREAN\u2026ELECTIONS? \n \n To outside observers, the idea of a North Korean election is nothing short of bizarre. But on January 9, 2009, the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly \u2013 the highest legislative body of the North Korean state \u2013 was dissolved, and elections to choose its lawmakers were called. \n \n Election day came on March 8, with newspapers full of editorials compelling the people of North Korea to vote. State news agency KCNA implored North Koreans to \u201cparticipate in the election of deputies as one and vote for the candidates\u201d, remarking that voter participation would mean \u201cthe government of the DPRK will grow remarkably stronger\u201d. \n \n The votes were counted the next day, with turnout at 99.98 percent \u2013 and the Workers\u2019 Party won by a landslide, winning 606 of the 687 seats, and all of the seats in the parliament going to members of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland, the electoral coalition which props up the government. In district 333, where the late Kim Jong Il ran, the Dear Leader was unanimously re-elected. \n \n \u201cAll the voters of constituency no. 333 participated in the election and voted for Supreme Commander of the Korean People\u2019s Army Kim Jong Il\u201d, KCNA reported, saying that \u201cthis is the expression of all servicepersons\u2019 and people\u2019s absolute support and profound trust in Kim Jong Il\u201d. \n \n There\u2019s an election this year, too, on March 9, and leader of the country Kim Jong Un will stand for parliament, for the Mount Paektu constituency (the \u2018divine\u2019 mountain where his father is said to have been born). Judging from past experience, it is safe to assume that, once again, the Workers\u2019 Party will win by a landslide. \n \n Main picture: Eric Lafforgue ||||| The turnout rate among registered eligible voters was an equally implausible 99.7 percent. KCNA added that those who were unable to vote either live abroad or work on the high seas. \n \n Candidates in local elections in North Korea were elected with 100 percent of the vote, the North's official Korean Central News Agency reported Wednesday. \n \n Voters in North Korea are given a choice of either voting for or against a single candidate endorsed by the state in the constituency. To vote yes, they simply post a blank bal lot paper, but to vote no they have to cross out the name of the candidate. \n \n \"It's difficult to vote against the candidate because there are people watching right behind the voters,\" as a North Korean defector said. \n \n The news agency said 28,116 \"laborers, farmers and intellectuals\" were elected to people's assemblies at provincial and city levels. ||||| Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Sunday is a national holiday in North Korea to allow people to vote in local elections \n \n Local elections are being held in North Korea - the first since ruler Kim Jong-un came to power in 2011. \n \n It is the joint-most corrupt country in the world with Somalia, according to Transparency International, and the same family has ruled since 1948. \n \n So why is it holding elections? And how reliable are they? \n \n Image copyright AFP/KCNA \n \n What will be decided? \n \n Local elections have been held in North Korea since 1999 - let's not forget that the country's full name is, technically, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). \n \n Sunday's elections are to decide provincial governors, mayors and local assemblies in the country of almost 25m people. \n \n The number of seats is determined by each district's population. \n \n In the second provincial elections in 2003, one report said 26,650 \"officials, workers, peasants and intellectuals\" were elected. \n \n Image copyright Instagram/@simonkoryo Image caption An Instagram image by Simon Cockerell, of Beijing-based North Korea tour operator Koryo Tours, shows a 2015 election poster in Pyongyang \n \n What options do voters have? \n \n The choice is limited - there is only one candidate on the ballot in each district, and while the selection of candidates is made by the governing coalition, they are closely overseen by Kim Jong-un's Workers' Party. \n \n Ahead of last year's elections to name deputies for the country's assembly, The Economist reported that voting did not take place in secret, and any dissenting votes must be placed in a separate ballot box. \n \n Abstaining or voting no are considered acts of treason. \n \n Image copyright Reuters Image caption Many North Koreans will return to vote - though mainly from China, not at the South Korean border (above) \n \n Is there more to the election than meets the eye? \n \n In the last local election, in 2011, there was a turnout of 99.7%, with the state news agency saying those unable to vote were abroad or on the high seas. \n \n Having such a high reported turnout has its advantages for the state, observers say, in that it acts as an informal census. \n \n \"The government checks the list of voters and if your name is not on the list, they will investigate it\", one North Korean defector told the NK News website. \n \n \"It is often during election that the government finds out about defectors and people who have been missed.\" \n \n If the state works out you did not vote, NK News says, \"you and your family are in trouble\". \n \n Image copyright Reuters \n \n What about Kim Jong-un? \n \n Sunday's elections do not decide the leadership of the country. \n \n Parliamentary elections are also held in North Korea, and they decide who rules the country - which is always a foregone conclusion. \n \n Kim Jong-un won in the last parliamentary election in 2014 - gaining 100% of the vote in his Mount Paektu constituency.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 To say North Koreans turned out in droves to vote in state elections yesterday would be an understatement, because state media are reporting 99.7% voter turnout, Sky News reports. That's only the first eyebrow-raiser about the country's electoral process, held every four years so voters can \"choose\" mayors, governors, and local assemblies. North Koreans over age 17 are not only required to show, they're also told which preapproved candidates to vote for by placing already prepared ballots in the ballot boxes, CNN notes. And according to Sky, it was a \"festive atmosphere,\" with voters \"singing and dancing\" as they cast votes. \"All participants took part in the elections with extraordinary enthusiasm to cement the revolutionary power,\" the Korean Central News Agency proclaimed. Voting is simple: To vote \"yes\" for the candidate predetermined by Kim Jong Un's Workers' Party, participants just place their ballot in the correct box; those who vote \"no\" place their ballot in a separate box, all within view of elections officials, the Economist explained in 2014. Abstaining or voting no is viewed as treason, the BBC notes. The real reason for even having the vote is basically to serve as a census of sorts and to keep track of no-show defectors, NK News notes. A professor of Asian studies explains that this election system makes even more extreme the one used in the Soviet Union during the Cold War, including the ridiculously high turnout rates. \"People used to joke that on the day of elections that no one would dare to die in North Korea, let alone lose consciousness,\" he says. As for that 0.3% who didn't vote this time? KCNA says those individuals either live abroad or work \"on the high seas,\" per Chosun Ilbo.",
    "generated_summary": "North Korea's state-controlled elections saw a 99.97% voter turnout on Sunday. Almost the entire country reportedly made it to the polls, including the elderly and ill. Voters were handed ballot papers but didn't mark them. They would have instead deposited them in a ballot box, signifying their support for the pre-approved candidates. There is only one box to tick. Abstaining or voting no would be a dangerous act of treason, given that voting takes place in booths that do not provide any secrecy and dissenting votes are posted into a separate ballot box. The results of the election are expected to be officially announced early next week.",

    "document": "Amazon declined to give police any of the information that the Echo logged on its servers, but it did hand over Bates' account details and purchases. Police say they were able to pull data off of the speaker, but it's unclear what info they were able to access. Due to the so-called always on nature of the connected device, the authorities are after any audio the speaker may have picked up that night. Sure, the Echo is activated by certain words, but it's not uncommon for the IoT gadget to be alerted to listen by accident. \n \n Police say Bates had several other smart home devices, including a water meter. That piece of tech shows that 140 gallons of water were used between 1AM and 3AM the night Collins was found dead in Bates' hot tub. Investigators allege the water was used to wash away evidence of what happened off of the patio. The examination of the water meter and the request for stored Echo information raises a bigger question about privacy. At a time when we have any number of devices tracking and automating our habits at home, should that information be used against us in criminal cases? \n \n Bates' attorney argues that it shouldn't. \"You have an expectation of privacy in your home, and I have a big problem that law enforcement can use the technology that advances our quality of life against us,\" defense attorney Kimberly Weber said. Of course, there's also the question of how reliable information is from smart home devices. Accuracy can be an issue for any number of IoT gadgets. However, an audio recording would seemingly be a solid piece of evidence, if released. \n \n Just as we saw with the quest to unlock an iPhone in the San Bernardino case, it will be interesting to see how authorities and the companies who make smart home devices work out the tension between serving customers, maintaining privacy and pursuing justice. \n \n Update: An Amazon spokesperson gave Engadget the following statement on the matter: \n \n \"Amazon will not release customer information without a valid and binding legal demand properly served on us. Amazon objects to overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands as a matter of course.\" \n \n As a refresher, Echo only captures audio and streams it to the cloud when the device hears the wake word \"Alexa.\" A ring on the top of the device turns blue to give a visual indication that audio is being recorded. Those clips, or \"utterances\" as the company calls them, are stored in the cloud until a customer deletes them either individually or all at once. When that's done, the \"utterances\" are permanently deleted. What's more, the microphones on an Echo device can be manually turned off at any time. ||||| Please enable Javascript to watch this video \n \n BENTONVILLE (KFSM) -- Bentonville police arrested a suspect Monday (Feb. 22) in connection to a death investigation that began in November 2015. \n \n James Andrew Bates, 31, of Bentonville was taken into custody on suspicion of first-degree murder in the death of Victor Parris Collins, 47, of Centerton, according to a probable cause affidavit released by the Benton County prosecutor. \n \n The affidavit states the Arkansas State Crime Lab ruled Collins death a homicide by strangulation with a contributing cause of drowning. \n \n Bates called 911 at about 9:30 a.m. on Nov. 22, 2015 and notified dispatchers Collins was dead in his hot tub on the back patio at his home on SW Elm Manor Avenue, the affidavit states. \n \n Bates told officers he had invited Collins and two other friends, Owen McDonald and Sean Henry, to his home the night before to watch a Razorback football game during which they drank beer and took several shots of vodka, according to the affidavit. \n \n After Henry left, the suspect, the victim and McDonald decided to get in the hot tub where they continued to drink until about 1 a.m. when Bates went to bed for the night leaving Collins and McDonald in the hot tub, the affidavit states. \n \n Bates said he found Collins floating face down in the hot tub when he woke up several hours later, according to the affidavit. \n \n After getting consent to search Bates\u2019 home, detectives found Collins floating face up in the hot tub and noticed the water was tinted red and appeared to contain bodily fluids and blood, the affidavit states. They also noticed Collins had a black eye, a cut on his eyelid, his lips were swollen and bruised, and he was bleeding from his mouth and nose, according to the affidavit. \n \n Detectives observed the rim of the hot tub and the patio had been sprayed down with water and two hot tub head cushions and three hot tub knobs were lying on the ground nearby, the affidavit states. One of the head cushions appeared to have diluted blood spots on it, according to the affidavit. Investigators also found watered down blood spots on the sides of the hot tub and another large area of blood spatter on the hot tub cover, the affidavit states. \n \n The crime lab later determined the blood belonged to Collins, according to the affidavit. \n \n Detectives also noticed the hose had been used, which they noted was unusual given the freezing temperatures, the affidavit states. They determined the evidence pointed to a struggle and a cover-up, according to the affidavit. \n \n Over the course of the next several days, detectives interviewed Bates and several witnesses and collected more evidence, the affidavit states. \n \n Phone records show Bates had texted a woman throughout the evening, then placed several calls to his father, friends, including McDonald, and the Flying Fish restaurant overnight, according to the affidavit. All of the calls were cancelled before they had a chance to go through, the affidavit states. \n \n Bates told investigators he didn\u2019t remember making the calls and claimed they had been so-called butt dials, according to the affidavit. Detectives discredited that claim since Bates kept his phone locked by pass code or finger print ID and noted the call times were not consistent with his statement that he had gone to bed at 1 a.m., the affidavit states. \n \n During one of their interviews with Bates, investigators took photos of small cuts and scratches on his hands, which Bates claimed were caused by his cats and Crossfit workouts, according to the affidavit. \n \n Police then interviewed McDonald who told them Collins was alive when he left Bates\u2019 house and McDonald\u2019s wife confirmed her husband returned home at around 12:30 a.m., the affidavit states. \n \n Detectives determined McDonald also got a ride from a concerned neighbor who saw him walking through the neighborhood while intoxicated. Investigators note there was no physical indication that McDonald had been in a struggle with someone. \n \n Detectives then went back to Bates\u2019 home and did a more extensive search of his hot tub where they found a broke pair of glasses belonging to Collins, Collins\u2019 wedding ring and a broken shot glass at the bottom of the spa, according to the affidavit. \n \n They also took photographs of Bates\u2019 whole body and discovered he had a large bruise, as well as several deep scratches on his abdomen, back and arms, the affidavit states. \n \n In December, detectives obtained water and electrical usage data from the Bentonville Utilities Department for the hours Bates said he was in bed the morning Collins died, according to the affidavit. The data showed the residence used 50 gallons of water between 1 to 2 a.m. on Nov. 22 and an additional 90 gallons of water between 2 and 3 a.m. In comparison, the residence only used 10 gallons of water when the men were together earlier that evening. \n \n Detectives determined the extra water usage between 1 and 3 a.m. was consistent with the patio being sprayed down, the affidavit states. They also determined that much water usage had never occurred at the residence since October 2013, according to the affidavit. \n \n Investigators concluded Bates was the only person with Collins at his home after midnight, the affidavit states. \n \n Bates is currently being held at the Benton County Jail without bond. \n \n People who said they've known Bates for years told 5NEWS everything in the probable cause affidavit is completely out of character. \n \n According to a Go Fund Me page set up for the Collins family, memorial services for Collins were held in Bentonville and in his native Georgia. \n \n Jamie Gianfala, a long-time friend of Collins', said he was shocked to hear his friend had been murdered. \n \n \"For him to die this way, and for it to be a homicide, it really does bother me,\" Gianfala said. \"Because, he was the kind of guy who prevented that kind of stuff.\" \n \n Collins was a former law enforcement officer before moving to Arkansas with his family. The Canton Police Department in Canton, Georgia confirmed Collins was a police officer there from 1998 until 2010. Prior to that he had worked as a deputy at the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office in Georgia. \n \n A lieutenant with the Canton Police Department said Collins had had several knee surgeries and moved to Louisiana and then Arkansas after his wife, Kristine, was transferred to those states for her job with Walmart. \n \n The Go Fund Me page states Victor and his wife were married for more than 18 years and had five children.",

The device listens for voice commands but is often triggered into \"listen\" mode by accident and could, thus, have \"overheard\" something useful, Engadget reports. Authorities have issued a warrant asking Amazon.com to turn over audio and other records from the device in what The Information says \"may be the first case of its kind.\" Bates says he had Collins and two other friends over to watch a football game and drink on the evening of Nov. 21, 2015, 5 News reported in February, when Bates was arrested. Bates says one friend left, but Collins and the other friend got in the hot tub and kept drinking. He says he left them there when he went to bed, and found Collins floating face down in the hot tub the next morning. (The other friend is not a suspect.) Authorities found the hot tub water tinted red and Collins with a black eye, swollen and bruised lips, a cut on his eyelid, and blood coming from his nose and mouth; it was ultimately ruled that Collins died by strangulation, with drowning as a contributing cause. Detectives learned that 140 gallons of water were used between 1am and 3am on the morning Collins died, and a hose was used.

Records showed he used that name in 1998 to obtain a license from the state of Florida for his construction business called Atlantic Development Corporation. \n \n There is no statute of limitations for desertion, and Michels will stand trial in a military court. \n \n However, the military rarely enforces the highest sentences for desertion. This ranges from a dishonourable discharge, a prison term typically between two to three years, up to the death penalty. But soldiers are only executed for desertion during wartime, and even then, it has to be demonstrated that their action left serving personnel in danger. \n \n For instance, even at the height of the Iraq war fewer than one per cent of deserters served prison time, according to New York magazine. \n \n Also, this week Bowe Bergdahl, the US soldier held as a Taliban captive in Afghanistan for five years, pleaded guilty to desertion and misbehaviour before the enemy. \n \n The 31-year-old Army sergeant entered his plea on Monday (16 October) before a military judge at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. \n \n The Idaho native's lawyers have argued he cannot get a fair trial following criticism from Donald Trump during last year's presidential campaign. Trump had called him \"a no-good traitor who should have been executed\". \n \n The military does not keep strict records for servicemen and women who have deserted, but the outstanding number is estimated to be around 50,000 based on internal military data, according to New York magazine. ||||| An Airman who disappeared from an Air Force Base in North Dakota 40 years ago is in custody of the U.S. Air Force after he was discovered last week living in Florida. \n \n Jeffrey Michels, 64, was arrested Thursday on charges of desertion after he failed to report for duty at North Dakota\u2019s Minot Air Force Base on July 6, 1977, WFTV reported. \n \n WHAT KIND OF SENTENCING COULD BERGDAHL FACE? \n \n Michels, originally from East Liverpool, Ohio, was found living a double life in Sanford, Fla. \u2014 under the name \u201cJeffrey Lantz,\u201d according to a police report. \n \n The man reportedly used the fake name to obtain a business license in Florida in 1998.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Jeffrey Michels disappeared from an Air Force base in northern North Dakota on a summer day in 1977\u2014and was found last week in Florida living a double life, Fox News reports. Michels, 64, was arrested Oct. 12 on desertion charges filed against him after he went missing from Minot Air Force Base near the Canadian border. Police say the former airman had taken the name Jeffrey Lantz, married, and had kids, per WFTV. In 1998, \"Lantz\" applied for a business license and started a construction company, Atlantic Development Corporation. Michels, originally from Ohio, was nabbed after the Facebook group Veteran Doe posted his photo in July, nearly 40 years to the day after he failed to report for duty. (That photo has since been taken down.) The site calls \"attention to the many missing veteran/active duty cases and unidentified person cases where there is a possible military connection.\" The Air Force hasn't explained how Michels was found, per the Miami Herald. But Seminole County authorities identified him by a scar on his left leg near the ankle. There's no statute of limitations on desertion, so Michels will stand trial in a military court, per the IB Times. He was turned over to the custody of the Air Force's Office of Special Investigations. Why Michels walked away from the remote base is unknown, but the Herald notes it's known for its nuclear missile silos and hard winters. (One of the first women Army combat engineers was accused of desertion.)",

Thankfully we are not closing our doors but we are opening a new chapter. \n \n \u201cIsis\u201d is the name we carefully selected over ten years ago. \n \n I still remember when Hughan and I were sitting on the floor of our apartment surrounded by ideas, spreadsheets and options. We wanted to build the best practice we could and that included picking a name with meaning. Hughan\u2019s brother was the one to ultimately pitch the winner. \n \n The practice started with one full-time employee in a sub-leased space across from North Fulton Hospital. Even today, Hughan shudders at how nervous he was when he asked her to join him. He says, \u201cFor the first time I was going to be responsible for paying for someone\u2019s livelihood.\u201d It was a very small start but it was where Dr. Frederick realized his dream and hung his shingle. \n \n Today, ten years later, the Isis Women\u2019s Health Care organization employs nearly 30 people in three offices.

It\u2019s a name that we have all become proud to be associated with. \n \n Until now. \n \n One morning we woke up to news of a beheading by a terrorist organization the media chose to refer to as ISIS. It was tragic. But then it happened again, and again, and this group gained strength. Everyone called them something different; ISIS, ISIL, Islamic State\u2026we weren\u2019t sure what to call them. CNN, Fox News, Donald Trump and countless others seem to have settled on ISIS. That meant bad news for us. \n \n Initially we planned to stay the course. Surely, no one would confuse our ob/gyn practice for a terrorist organization?! We were wrong. \n \n People are mad. People are upset. People are confused. And they have let us know in some very unkind ways. \n \n And just like that, we are being forced to erase a decade\u2019s worth of work. We have taken the first step and removed the name from the building. But what name could possibly be a strong enough replacement? \n \n I\u2019m not going to lie. This is hard. But instead of being sad, we want to turn this into something positive and fun. Isis clients are some of the smartest, most creative and opinionated people in Atlanta. \n \n This time around, we\u2019re going to open up the process to all of you and ask if you have any ideas for a name. \n \n I can\u2019t think of a better way to move into the next decade together with a new name and a better way to practice. \n \n Let the brainstorming begin!",

They think ideology is something squished down on their heads from on high, something imposed on them by big thinkers who create systems we're all supposed to conform to.

They rarely have any. \n \n They haven\u2019t had a decisive influence since Lyndon Johnson carried Texas for John Kennedy in 1960. (That and Illinois put Kennedy over the top.) This time, however, the effect could be significant. The Democrats\u2019 Mediscare barrage is already in full swing. Paul Ryan, it seems, is determined to dispossess Grandmother, then toss her over a cliff. If the charge is not successfully countered, good-bye Florida. \n \n Republicans have a twofold answer. First, hammer home that their Medicare plan affects no one over 55, let alone 65. Second, go on offense. Point out that President Obama cuts Medicare by $700 billion to finance Obamacare. \n \n It\u2019s a sweet judo throw: Want to bring up Medicare, supposedly our weakness? Fine. But now you\u2019ve got to debate Obamacare, your weakness \u2014 and explain why you are robbing Granny\u2019s health care to pay for your pet project. \n \n If Mitt Romney and Ryan can successfully counterattack Mediscare, the Ryan effect becomes a major plus. Because: \n \n (a) Ryan nationalizes the election and makes it ideological, reprising the 2010 dynamic that delivered a \u201cshellacking\u201d to the Democrats. \n \n (b) If the conversation is about big issues, Obama cannot hide from his dismal economic record and complete failure of vision. In Obama\u2019s own on-camera commercial \u2014 \u201cthe choice . . . couldn\u2019t be bigger\u201d \u2014 what\u2019s his big idea? A 4.6-point increase in the marginal tax rate of 2 percent of the population. \n \n That\u2019s it? That\u2019s his program? For a country with stagnant growth, ruinous debt and structural problems crying out for major entitlement and tax reform? Obama\u2019s \u201cplan\u201d would cut the deficit from $1.20 trillion to $1.12 trillion. It\u2019s a joke. \n \n (c) Image. Ryan, fresh and 42, brings youth, energy and vitality \u2014 the very qualities Obama projected in 2008 and has by now depleted. \u201cHope and change\u201d has become \u201cthe other guy killed a steelworker\u2019s wife.\u201d From transcendence to the political gutter in under four years. A new Olympic record. \n \n While Ryan\u2019s effect on 2012 is as yet undetermined \u2014 it depends on the success or failure of Mediscare \u2014 there is less doubt about the meaning of Ryan\u2019s selection for beyond 2012. He could well become the face of Republicanism for a generation. \n \n There\u2019s a history here. By choosing George H.W. Bush in 1980, Ronald Reagan gave birth to a father-son dynasty that dominated the presidential scene for three decades. The Bush name was on six of seven consecutive national tickets. \n \n When Dwight Eisenhower picked Richard Nixon in 1952, he turned a relatively obscure senator into a dominant national figure for a quarter-century, appearing on the presidential ticket in five of six consecutive elections. \n \n Even losing VP candidates can ascend to party leader and presumptive presidential nominee. Ed Muskie so emerged in 1968, until he melted down in New Hampshire in 1972. Walter Mondale so emerged in 1980 and won the presidential nomination four years later. (The general election was another story.) \n \n Winning is even better. Forty percent of 20th-century presidents were former VPs: Theodore Roosevelt, Coolidge, Truman, Johnson, Nixon, Ford and Bush (41). \n \n Before Aug. 11, Ryan already was the party\u2019s intellectual leader and de facto parliamentary leader \u2014 youngest-ever House Budget Committee chairman whose fiscal blueprint has driven congressional debate for two years. Now, however, he is second only to Romney as the party\u2019s undisputed political leader. \n \n And while Romney is the present, Ryan is the future. Romney\u2019s fate will be determined on Nov. 6. Ryan\u2019s presence, assuming he acquits himself well in the campaign, will extend for decades. \n \n Ryan\u2019s importance is enhanced by his identity as a movement conservative. Reagan was the first movement leader in modern times to achieve the presidency. Like him, Ryan represents a new kind of conservatism for his time. \n \n Reagan rejected the moderate accommodationism represented by Gerald Ford, the sitting president Reagan nearly overthrew in 1976. Ryan represents a new constitutional conservatism of limited government and individual opportunity that carried Republicans to victory in 2010, not just as a rejection of Obama\u2019s big-government hyper-liberalism but also as a significant departure from the philosophically undisciplined, idiosyncratically free-spending \u201ccompassionate conservatism\u201d of Obama\u2019s Republican predecessor. \n \n Ryan\u2019s role is to make the case for a serious approach to structural problems \u2014 a hardheaded, sober-hearted conservatism that puts to shame a reactionary liberalism that, with Greece in our future, offers handouts, bromides and a 4.6 percent increase in tax rates. \n \n If Ryan does it well, win or lose in 2012, he becomes a dominant national force. Mild and moderate Mitt Romney will have shaped the conservative future for years to come. \n \n The cunning of history. Or if you prefer, its sheer capriciousness. \n \n letters@charleskrauthammer.com",

The Catholic church in the Castro district has arguably the largest gay parish in the nation, and controversial new decisions have members worried about leadership, policies - even that the church might be shut down. \n \n And it all began with drag queens. \n \n When the archdiocese refused to allow drag queens to serve as emcees for charity events at the church's community hall, it fed rampant paranoia about antigay sentiment. The decision was initially blamed on incoming Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone, an outspoken opponent of same-sex marriage who has been championed by extreme conservative Catholic groups. Some read the drag-queen ban as a calculated slap in the face. \n \n Cordileone doesn't start his new job until October, but clearly the issue is bigger than drag queens at a fundraiser. The decision calls into question the responsibility of a church in the community, of the acceptance of all walks of life and the tenets of religion. \n \n \"Paranoia is very high,\" said Supervisor Scott Wiener, who represents the district. \"There are a lot of gay people for whom this religion is very important. It's just very, very sad.\" \n \n Even the possibility of closing the church, despite its illustrious San Francisco history, seems real. \n \n \"The (incoming) archbishop holds the keys to this building,\" said church business manager Mike Poma. \"He could close us any time.\" \n \n And for some, the move to quell the drag-queen decision by declaring that Ellard Hall would be closed to community events only made things worse. \n \n Most Holy Redeemer's new pastor, the Rev. Brian Costello, who did not return a phone call, arrived in July from a church in the Richmond District. But he made a point in his first official message to welcome \"old, young, married, gay, lesbian, transgender, affluent, home-cradle Catholics, radical, traditional, questioning and fervent.\" \n \n So, while he was initially opposed to having drag queens as entertainment for two fundraisers for sobriety and wellness groups at Ellard Hall, he listened when Poma asked him to reconsider. \n \n \"I told him, this is just dinner. It's not a strip show,\" Poma said. \"I told him it was going to be a powder keg.\" \n \n Poma says Costello responded by making two calls to the archdiocese, where the idea was turned down flat. \n \n \"We have to give (Costello) a break,\" Poma said. \"He's got a boss, you know. And he's never been immersed in gay culture in his life. He's learning.\" \n \n What he's learning is that what might seem very strange in Middle America is everyday life in the Castro. Drag queens may not be mainstream, except at Most Holy Redeemer, where they regularly attend Mass. \n \n \"We had some boys in miniskirts last Sunday,\" Poma said. \"And Father Costello met with them.\" \n \n It should also be said that some of the gay groups that have been using the hall have gone way over the top. Several years ago the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence featured a drag queen known as Peaches Christ, who waved a crucifix shaped like a dildo. Even longtime gay parishioners thought that was too much. \n \n The odd part of this manufactured controversy is how well the church has been working. A robust congregation of 450 to 550 members, more than 80 percent of whom are gay or lesbian, consider themselves practicing Catholics. For a religion that doesn't always seem welcoming to gays, that's impressive. \n \n So are services. Poma says he brought his mother to Mass and she couldn't get over the warm sound of \"all those men's voices.\" Poma says the music at Most Holy Redeemer is so renowned that visitors come from all over the country. \n \n \"We had some the other day,\" he said. \"Afterward they said, 'You've renewed my faith.' \" \n \n Hopefully, incoming Archbishop Cordileone will also attend with an open mind. And leave with the same feeling. ||||| SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The announcement by Pope Benedict XVI has been dubbed the \"Bombshell by the Bay.\" \n \n Next week, a key player in the passage of Proposition 8 \u2014 a man who has decried the \"contraceptive mentality\" of modern life \u2014 will become the leader of the Catholic Church here in the city that thrust same-sex marriage onto the national stage, the birthplace of the Summer of Love. \n \n Supporters view Archbishop-designate Salvatore Cordileone, the 56-year-old son of a commercial fisherman, as a charming and brilliant defender of the faith. He is fluent in Spanish and Italian, has been known to sing vintage TV theme songs in Latin and is a deep believer in a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. \n \n But many gay and lesbian Catholics worry that they will be marginalized after Cordileone's arrival. Oasis California, the Episcopal Church's gay ministry, convened a meeting recently at a Castro District bar to discuss how spiritual people should respond to the \"architect of Prop. 8\" coming to town. \n \n Cordileone's appointment \"re-emphasizes the Vatican's concern, and the U.S. bishops' concern, about gay marriage,\" said Father Thomas J. Reese, a senior fellow at Georgetown University's Woodstock Theological Center. \"Even in a city like San Francisco, they're willing to appoint someone who \u2026 has a high state and national profile on this issue. \n \n \"They're serious,\" Reese said, \"and they're not going to back down.\" \n \n During a July news conference, Cordileone was circumspect when discussing the \"cultural challenges\" his new diocese would present \u2014 which he said revolved around \"issues of family life and, essentially, come down to our understanding of the human person, the purpose of our human sexuality, what God calls us to do and how he calls us to live and how he calls us to love.\" \n \n But in a recent interview at the headquarters of the Oakland diocese, where he has served as bishop for three years, Cordileone was more direct: Gays and lesbians who are in sexual relationships of any kind, he said, should not receive the sacrament of Holy Communion, the central ritual of Catholic life. \n \n \"If we misuse the gift of sexuality, we're going to suffer the consequences,\" he said, \"and I firmly believe we are suffering the consequences.\" \n \n The prelate's light-filled office overlooks Oakland's Lake Merritt. Just beyond the graceful urban estuary, he said, are \"100 blocks of inner-city neighborhoods. Those are fatherless children.\" \n \n Cordileone will lead a flock of more than 500,000 Catholics spread over 91 parishes in three counties \u2014 San Francisco, San Mateo and Marin. Although it is not as influential as the country's largest dioceses, New York and Los Angeles among them, it is a high-profile destination for a fast-rising archbishop. \n \n And though he strives to deliver Catholicism's absolutes in as nuanced a fashion as possible, Cordileone said, people need to understand that \"the church is not going to change its teaching. ... The solution isn't to say, 'Well, I'm just going to disagree and continue being a Catholic.' That's not how we arrive at holiness.\" \n \n Unlike secular organizations, however, the church cannot just slam the door on dissenters, he said. Instead, the Catholic Church must reach out, support people, \"move them along to understand.\" \n \n Cordileone, who heads up the subcommittee for the promotion and defense of marriage of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, came early to the Proposition 8 battle. \n \n In 2007, the California Supreme Court was considering the constitutionality of a voter initiative that changed the state family code to say that \"only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.\" \n \n That September, the San Diego City Council was poised to join a friend-of-the-court brief in support of legalizing same-sex marriage in California. Cordileone \u2014 who grew up in San Diego and was its auxiliary bishop at the time \u2014 wrote a heartfelt letter to the lawmakers: \n \n \"We believe that marriage, by its very definition, can exist only between a man and a woman,\" Cordileone wrote. \"Moreover, study after study \u2014 not to mention common sense \u2014 show that children fare better in life when raised in a home with a loving father and mother in a stable, committed relationship.\" \n \n Society and its governing bodies should do everything in their power to \"encourage healthy and stable marriages,\" he added, while treating \"persons with same-sex attraction\" with \"respect, compassion and sensitivity.\" \n \n The council voted to act in support of gay marriage. But Mayor Jerry Sanders, who had been expected to veto the measure, called a last-minute news conference. Facing reporters, he choked up. One of his daughters is gay, he said. He could not tell her that she did not have the right to wed. \n \n A few weeks later, a small group of traditional-marriage backers gathered in a San Diego living room to strategize about how to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot in case the state Supreme Court overturned Proposition 22, which ultimately it did.",

Salvatore Cordileone, who officially takes charge next week, is considered an \"architect\" of Proposition 8, notes the Los Angeles Times. He helped develop the proposition to shoot down the state's gay marriage measure when he was an auxiliary bishop in San Diego. Cordileone's appointment by Pope Benedict \"re-emphasizes the Vatican's concern about gay marriage\" even in a city like San Francisco, Father Thomas J. Reese, a senior fellow at Georgetown University, tells the Times. \"They're serious, and they're not going to back down.\" Cordileone, who heads the \"defense of marriage\" subcommittee for the US Conference of Bishops, has warned that Catholics have to understand the \"church is not going to change its teaching,\" and has said that the sacrament of Communion should be denied to gays and lesbians in a relationship. \"Paranoia is very high,\" says San Francisco Supervisor Scott Wiener, whose district includes Most Holy Redeemer Church in the Castro, which could be the largest gay Catholic congregation in the nation. \"There are a lot of gay people for whom this religion is very important. It's just very, very sad,\" he tells the San Francisco Chronicle. The archdiocese recently banned drag queens from serving as emcees at charity events at the church. In Cordileone's most recent controversy, he was busted for drunk driving last month in San Diego\u2014and apologized.

He was a psychedelic chemist, a visionary, and a cognitive liberty advocate. He was also a dear friend, mentor, and role model to Earth & me (Fire). \n \n \n \n We were lucky to know him. \n \n He spent three decades synthesizing new psychedelic drugs in his California backyard lab, and he was credited with creating more than 100 previously unknown psychoactive compounds, but he was best known for a drug he didn't invent:Ecstasy.Alexander \"Sasha\" Shulgin, who in the 1970s rescued the circa-1912 pharmaceutical from obscurity by suggesting it would be viable for mental therapy, died yesterday at the age of 88, the organization Erowid announced:The former Dow Chemical Co. research chemist synthesized drugs with the approval of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, which gave him a license to analyze narcotics so that he could be an expert witness.He said he invented more than 150 drugs while he also worked a day job as a scientific consultant after leaving Dow.The Bay Area resident was of particular use in cases where the compounds were exotic or rare: Few \"designer drugs\" appeared to be outside his expertise and, often, he was their inventor.\"A lot of the materials in Schedule I are my invention,\" Shulgin once told us. \"I'm not sure if it's a point of pride or a point of shameThe booksandcataloged Shulgin's recipes. But after this reporter profiled Shulgin in the Los Angeles Times the DEA got cold feet about the arrangement.Wife Ann told us back then that the souring had been a few years in the making:The feds' objections were too late, though, and the chemist became an icon just as the rave scene - particularly massive in L.A. - adopted the tactile, feel-good drug as its own.\"I still haven't found anything like it to this day,\" Shulgin told us in '95.Ecstasy was outlawed by the federal government in 1985 , after it had already become somewhat of a club drug in Dallas and beyond.Shulgin moved on to other compounds, trying each one himself or allowing trusted friends to partake for research purposes.\"Inventing new psychoactive drugs,\" Ann said to us, \"is like composing new music.\"One drug that Shulgin called 5-TOM had a paralyzing effect, he said. But he wasn't afraid. He believed it was all worth it in the name of human discovery. And he wanted drugs like ecstasy legalized.Erowid said Shulgin had been \"battling various illnesses\" for several years and was recently diagnosed with terminal liver cancer.

According to one friend, he was spotted offering to teach the head of Boeing \u201ca new way to fly.\u201d \n \n \u03c0 \n \n \u03c0 \n \n \u03c0 \n \n 2 \n \n 2 \u201cFungi,\u201d \u201cfungus,\u201d and \u201cfunguses,\u201d with special attention paid to the variant pronunciations of \u201cfungi\u201d\u2014\u201cfun-gee\u201d and \u201cfun-guy.\u201d It should be noted these questions come from a man who published a two-page editorial in the Journal of Clinical Toxicology dedicated to how irksome it is when people incorrectly pluralize the word \u201camphetamine.\u201d The implication being that this grammatical error is the most heinous amphetamine abuse of all. So please, in the future remember Adderall contains amphetamine, not amphetamines. \n \n A friendly reminder to the DEA should they try to harass Shulgin. \n \n 3 \n \n 3 Shulgin\u2019s first chemical modification to the mescaline molecule was the addition of a single carbon atom to the ethylamine side chain, which produced an amphetamine called TMA. From there he developed TMA-2 through TMA-6. They became moderately popular psychedelics in Japan and the US, and TMA-6 remains an unscheduled substance. Shulgin enjoyed TMA-6, although he felt \u201ctoasting the toast in the toaster was difficult.\u201d \n \n Inside the Pyrex jungle. \n \n 4 \n \n 4 Shulgin created a series of sulfur-containing psychedelic amphetamines named after the Hebrew letter \u05d0 . ALEPH-1 was the first. True to his method of vigilant titration, his first dose was 250 nanograms. Over the course of 18 trials he worked up to a single milligram. It detonated an intellectual hydrogen bomb in his prefrontal cortex. \n \n A shelf of reagents, solvents, and a large jar of piperonal\u2014one precursor for MDA. \n \n 5 \n \n 5 2C-B is the archetypal Shulgin psychedelic. It possesses all the qualities he searched for throughout his carrier. 2C-B is potent, warm, corporeal, associative, shows no signs of physical toxicity, and has a short duration, ideal for psychotherapy. It is also extremely \u201cerotic.\u201d Shulgin said, \u201cIf there is anything ever found to be an effective aphrodisiac, it will probably be patterned after 2C-B in structure.\u201d It was, unfortunately, made illegal after a brief stint as a legal sex enhancer and widespread distribution under the name Ubulawu Nomathotholo by South African shamans (an incredible story for another time). \n \n The author touching a specimen of Trichocereus bridgesii forma monstrose, aka the penis cactus. It was very \u201cerotic.\u201d \n \n It\u2019s never easy to say goodbye. \n \n I love Alexander Shulgin. I\u2019ve loved him from the first moment I read about him. He is my idol, my hero, my sun, my O2. I love each of the 978 pages of his phenethylamine magnum opus,), and every milligram of his 1.13-kilogram tryptamine treatise,). Above my bed I\u2019ve pinned a large picture of Shulgin cuddling with his wife, Ann. I often sleep with a copy ofnot under my pillow, buta pillow. He is the grandfather of Ecstasy, the molecular magician, the atomic conquistador. Over the span of 50 years he has created more new psychedelic drugs than the Amazon jungle ever has. He is more of a mythological creature, a chemical centaur, than he is a real person. But he does exist, as I am about to attest.After years of preparation I called the Shulgin residence, ostensibly for an interview. It was the sort of call that you prepare for by jotting down an index card\u2019s worth of dialogue. The type of event that requires careful pre-call meditative deep breathing, positive affirmation, autohypnotic closed-eye success visualizations, and as many as five throat clears. I somehow managed to dial the number and, while I listened to the ring-back chirp two-second bursts of perfectly overlapping sinusoidal waves followed by four-second stretches of exophthalmic silence and yet another sinusoidal ring-back tone, my nose actually began towith anticipation. The call was answered by Ann.We had a conversation; she called me \u201choney,\u201d which I enjoyed tremendously, and unexpectedly had a New Zealand accent. Ann told me that Sasha (Shulgin\u2019s friends call him this) no longer grants interviews\u2014he\u2019s conserving his limited energy to finish his last book and work in the lab. After hearing this, I carefully explained that I did not specifically require an interview. I just wanted a meeting, an informal conversation. Eventually it was decided that I could visit for a few hours before an electrocardiogram appointment. She reminded me that he really does not give interviews anymore and if my meeting with him were to turn into one, it would be his last. I was elated.Although Alexander Shulgin is not exactly a household name, he is unquestionably the most important psychedelic chemist who has ever lived. Those who do know of him are usually only familiar with his role in the rediscovery and popularization of MDMA. But MDMA is just one of 100-plus unique chemicals that compose Shulgin\u2019s pharmacopeia, which extends so far into the unknown that he often has to invent new terms to describe the effects (\u201ceye romp\u201d is one of my favorites). The drugs are selective auditory and tactile hallucinogens, psychedelics that dilate time or send the user into a state of amnesiac confusion, antidepressants, aphrodisiacs, stimulants, empathogens, entactogens, neurotoxins, and at least one very profitable insecticide. They are also some of the most valuable medicines known to man, and although only a fraction of them have been formally studied, they are the best tools we have for understanding the chemical composition of the human mind.Shulgin\u2019s career started at the Dow Chemical Company, where he made a name for himself synthesizing Zectran, the first biodegradable insecticide. After this success he was given freedom to work on chemicals of his choosing. He chose psychedelics and went on to create an amphetamine called DOM, which at the time was second only to LSD in potency. A single large dose could last a solid 48 hours. In 1967, Brooklynite chemist Nick Sand realized the drug\u2019s market potential. He built an industrial laboratory in San Francisco where he cooked DOM in a 150-gallon soup vessel and sold it by the kilo to the Hells Angels, who rode across America unleashing tens of thousands of excessively potent 20-mg DOM tablets on the public. The influx caused hordes of hippies to freak out at the Golden Gate Park Human Be-In.Meanwhile, less than a block from Tompkins Square Park, the NYPD busted down the door of a psychedelic chapel called the Church of the Mystifying Elation in an early-morning raid. Police seized $8 million worth of psychedelics, including 1,500 doses of DOM, two marijuana plants, and \u201cnumerous mattresses.\u201d Stories of emergency-room DOM freak-outs abounded in the press; one user in Manhattan ingested a dose and ritualistically performed seppuku, disemboweling himself with a samurai sword on Mother\u2019s Day. At this point the drug was still largely unidentified and was alternately reported in theto be a relative of a secret military nerve gas or as the \u201ccaviar of psychedelic drugs.\u201d Eventually it was realized that DOM was the product of legitimate pharmaceutical research conducted by a then-unnamed chemist at Dow. Unsurprisingly, this made Dow very unhappy. Once the source was identified, Shulgin\u2019s ties to the company were severed.Free from Dow, Shulgin set up a personal laboratory in his backyard and began researching drugs with complete independence and with the realization that the chemicals he created had the potential to find their way into the heads of at least 1 million people. He tested each new compound personally and, if he deemed it worthy, on his wife and friends, with a special emphasis on the sex-enhancing properties of psychedelics (or as he calls it, \u201cthe erotic\u201d). Over the course of 50 years, he completed the most exhaustive examination of psychedelic structures ever accomplished and manufactured an array of drugs that rivals the output of many large pharmaceutical companies. All the while he has maintained his sanity and gentlemanly composure by playing the viola, teaching university classes, and attending elite soirees at Bohemian Grove.When I arrived at Shulgin\u2019s home in Lafayette, California, he was peacefully sitting at the kitchen table. I walked through the sliding glass door, greeted him, and then embraced him, which produced a euphoria far greater than that of MDMA and a time dilation more profound than the effects of 2C-T-4. We disengaged and, without pause, he began to riddle me: \u201cCan you name the two words in the English language that begin with two consecutive a\u2019s?\u201dI thought for a moment before answering, \u201cAardvark is one\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, good, and the other?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t think of another.\u201dHe bent down his head and said in a low whisper, \u201c.\u201d\u201cAardwolf?\u201d I asked, and with that he had already risen from his chair and shuffled into the hallway to retrieve a giant yellow dictionary, which he dropped onto the kitchen table and pushed toward me. Sure enough, it\u2019s there, and on his prompt I read the definition aloud:-'wu\u00b7lf\u00b7-lvz [Affric, fr.earth + wolf; akin to OEwolf\u2013more at WOLF]a hyenalike quadruped of South Africa having a striped coat, five-toed forefeet, and a distinct mane, feeds chiefly on carrion and insects (as termites), and is usu. placed in thethough formerly separated in another family ().an (extremely) unexpected nonpsychedelic-related thing, which confuses me [see more at I\u2019M NOT PREPARED FOR THIS].\u201cOK,\u201d Shulgin said, satisfied. \u201cWe\u2019ve solved that problem. But now, for example, do you know what a lowena is?\u201d\u201cNo, what\u2019s that?\u201d I asked credulously.\u201cIt\u2019s the opposite of a highena.\u201d\u201cAha!\u201d I urinated a microliter in my pants and changed the subject. \u201cI brought you a peach pie. Would you like a slice?\u201dHe answered the question with another question: \u201cHow many numbers are to the right of the decimal point in?\u201d\u201cJust one.\u201d I had nervously confused right and left, but Shulgin immediately adjusted his line of questioning.\u201cOK, so what is the value of? 3.14159265\u2026 But how many numbersappear in front of the decimal point inor in any rational number?\u201d\u201cPotentially an infinite amount of numbers.\u201d\u201cRight, and how large is this infinity?\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cHowis this?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a difficult question to answer,\u201d I replied.\u201cI\u2019ll give you another question and let you do a comparison: How many numbers are there to the right of the decimal point? One? An infinite number? Not only an infinite number but an infinitely larger infinite number.\u201d\u201cHow can? OK, wait\u2026\u201dFrom there on our conversation wound through similar territory. We spoke mostly in riddles, including but not limited to numerical palindromes, hyphenated palindromes (or the lack thereof), SI units of mass with an emphasis on the femtogram, words that begin with the letterand words that begin with the sound, the ambiguities of cactus identification, the correct pluralization of the word \u201cfungus\u201d (of which there are three variations and four pronunciations), and an analysis of the peach pie I brought as a hypothetical new psychedelic drug (5-MeO-PEACHPIE). I was asked to calculate an appropriate portion for my first taste. After extrapolating data from its closest analog (5-MeO-APPLEPIE), we decided on a one-femtogram slice (for safety reasons). Then he put his sandals on over his black socks, picked up his silver cane, and asked, \u201cShould we go to the lab?\u201dBefore we left, Ann brought out a large, frosty pitcher of strawberry lemonade. I had to remind myself that this was Ann Shulgin\u2014the woman who pioneered the practice of MDMA psychotherapy\u2014who in this very house, perhaps in this room, used MDMA and 2C-B to treat everything from nitrous-oxide addiction to demonic possession (or, technically, postexorcism demonic harassment), often with patients finding themselves cured in ways that years of conventional talk therapy could have only begun to remedy. I sipped some of her lemonade, gazed past their Huichol yarn paintings through a window that perfectly framed the two-humped Mount Diablo, and sighed. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind my using my bare hands,\u201d Ann said as she dropped additional ice cubes into my glass. \u201cNot at all,\u201d I said. I wouldn\u2019t have minded if the ice cubes were dropped into my cup with her bare feet.After sipping and savoring some lemonade, I took a nystagmic walk down the hall and entered the bathroom. The wallpaper\u2019s lattice of black diamonds is the very same pattern that reached out and shook Shulgin\u2019s hand during the first trials of TMA-6.As I stood over the powder-blue toilet attempting to pee, I pondered the contents of his septic tank\u2014a pharmacokinetic treasure trove, which undoubtedly contains the world\u2019s most diverse collection of psychedelic urinary and fecal metabolites!Even Shulgin\u2019s modestly sized burgundy terrycloth hand towels and wintergreen mouth rinse demanded my attention. I could hardly pee.I left the bathroom to find Shulgin waiting in the backyard. We walked down the glittering stone path to his laboratory. The sun was shining through the leaves, casting shadows on his gargantuan collection of psychedelic cacti, including an enviable(a spineless phalliformic mescaline cactus, also known as the penis plant). We passed a coiled garden hose, which Shulgin once notionally unraveled while testing the effects of ALEPH-1, and crossed over a small metal bridge as the lab became visible. Overgrown with vines, it was a patchwork cottage of corrugated metal and plastic that emanated the sharp, musty scent of DMT. As he opened the door, he exclaimed, \u201cHo-ho-ho!\u201dThe lab was a Pyrex jungle, a barrage of borosilicate, a bevy of beakers, a bouquet of burettes, all manner of vulcanized rubber bung. Desiccation bells, pinned butterflies, and mason jars crammed with a slurry of what I could only guess were pickled mushrooms. Pressed behind a sheet of glass were three blades of ryegrass infected with deep purple fingers of, the fungal precursor to LSD and the mold responsible for the medieval scourge of Saint Anthony\u2019s Fire. On his blackboard was a diagram of a yet-to-be-synthesized molecule, which I recognized as 3,4-MD-4-methylaminorex\u2014a derivative of the highly euphoric psychostimulant 4-methylaminorex that, in the mid-80s, attained cult-drug status under the name U4E-uh. Beneath the molecular diagram was the simple caption \u201cMAKE ME!\u201dThere was a collection of round-bottomed flasks on the table, each containing a small scab of impure tryptamine crust. One flask was labeled 5-MeO-MALT, another 5-MeO-NALT. Shulgin began to explain, \u201cDALT is the first one\u2014it\u2019s the diallyl\u2014and the methylallyl is MALT. Then EALT and then,\u201d he puckered his lips and pushed out a plosive, \u201cPALT and iso-PALT and so forth. 5-MeO-DALT was an active compound, so I\u2019m pursuing that line further. Usually they wait about four years after I get something out that becomes popular, and then they make it illegal. But I sent the synthesis for 5-MeO-DALT to a friend. He put it on the internet, and one month later it was synthesized in China and sent via Europe to this country. Now it\u2019s available on the street!\u201dA bit of background on that statement: On May 24, 2004, Shulgin sent an email to a psychonaut named Murple regarding the synthesis and effects of 5-MeO-DALT. He formatted the description in the style of aentry and said that it would be included in his forthcoming book. That same day, Murple posted the 5-MeO-DALT synthesis on his personal website. On June 25, it became openly available from a gray-market laboratory for $200 per gram. On September 25, 2004, three months after the chemical hit the market, the first-recorded 5-MeO-DALT overdose occurred when a Floridian user accidentally ingested 225 mg (more than 11 times the maximum dose Shulgin tested) in the midst of Hurricane Jeanne. He survived the experience and shared numinous insights such as \u201cOzzy and the like do not mix well at all with this substance.\u201dIf Shulgin whispers even a word of praise about a new drug, it is almost guaranteed to traverse international borders within a few months. If someone dies after taking one of these substances, there will be irresponsible media coverage, public outrage, and hurried scheduling by various drug-enforcement agencies. The UK went so far as to ban the entire roster of drugs presented inin a single act. Despite his detractors, Shulgin firmly believes that his research must remain openly available for educational purposes\u2014whether it\u2019s DEA officers or DXM addicts. But there is one instance where Shulgin deemed his chemical revelations too enlightening for public consumption. While testing an amphetamine he christened ALEPH-1, he wrote in his notebook, \u201cTell NO ONE about this drug so that it can never be identified and there can be no moves made to destroy it\u2026 Persisting in scientific publication in all peripheral areas as subterfuge, diversion. Keep all progressive work in my appendices. Code them \u2018SH\u2019\u2014too informative.\u201d It was \u201ctoo informative\u201d because Shulgin believes ALEPH-1 is the \u201cessence of power\u201dand if the DEA discovered it they would attempt to destroy it. When I asked him whether he has ever felt that way since, he quickly said, \u201cNo, you must publish.\u201d But part of me wonders whether there is in fact a special notebook labeled \u201cSH\u201d stashed away somewhere on a cobwebbed shelf.Later in the day, Paul D., Shulgin\u2019s collaborator, joined us. He has known Shulgin for decades and began assisting him in the lab last year. I asked Paul whether he had tried any of the new tryptamines they were currently working on, and he shook his head, \u201cNo, Sasha isthe first to taste new materials.\u201d The reason Shulgin is always the first to experience his creations is completely altruistic. Should a chemical have an unexpected toxic effect, such as inducing a seizure, he wants to protect his family and friends. Although I suspect there is another reason Shulgin likes to have the first taste: The sensation of synthesizing a completely unknown drug and ingesting it, a sensation that can only happen one time, is clearly druglike in and of itself. It\u2019s the breaking of a transdimensional, neurochemical hymen. In a sense, it\u2019s the one drug he keeps coming back to. Ask Shulgin what his favorite psychedelic is and he will say \u201c2C-B\u201dwithout hesitation. Ask him how many times he has taken it and he\u2019ll say \u201ca few.\u201d This is a guy who has had approximately 10,000 psychedelic experiences. No drug, not even his cherished 2C-B, tastes better than the untasted.Eventually Paul brought in dozens of green cardboard boxes full of chemicals. They contained a physical history of Shulgin\u2019s entire pharmacopeia. A life\u2019s work corked up in three-dram vials. The collection wastantalizing and borderline pornographic. My heart rate increased and my brow began to perspire, as I tried my hardest to avoid undignified Tex Avery-type behaviors like panting, making ansound, or letting my eyeballs fall out of my head. He removed the lid, revealing 100 alphanumerically indexed cells that housed glass vials, with conspicuous lacunae once occupied by Schedule I drugs. Each vial\u2019s gummed label was hand-inscribed with a small molecular diagram. Many of these substances don\u2019t exist anywhere else in the known universe. Shulgin is not only a chemist, he is a collector. Early in his career he ambitiously sought to accumulate every psychoactive drug in the world but eventually realized he couldn\u2019t keep up. According to the index card, the (partial) contents of the single box Paul opened included trichocereine, crude curare, isomescaline, amphetamine, R-DOM, MDMA, DET, DiPT, scopolamine, benz-phetamine, d-methamphetamine, aspirin, berberine, physostigmine, papaverine, pipradol, aconite, thebane, pilocarpine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, several forensic samples of PCP dated and labeled \u201cillicit PCP 1975,\u201d and my dear old friend Ritalin.Outside the lab Paul was sorting through another box of boxes, which contained at least 1,000 additional vials. \u201cThese are mostly chemical intermediates\u2014a trimethoxybenzaldehyde oil,\u201d he said as he uncorked one and held a sample of black goo to his nose for a sniff. \u201cIt has an interesting smell,\u201d he remarked as he passed it to me. I closed one nostril and took a hard whiff. It smelled like Vicks VapoRub and sent a horrific pulse of nausea through my body, which was accompanied by an instantaneous pounding headache. Still, I\u2019m glad to have allowed a few femtograms of chemical from Shulgin\u2019s collection into my bloodstream. Paul continued, \u201cThis is 2-ethoxy-benzaldehyde.\u201d He took another sniff and passed the vial to me as if we were assessing the bouquet of a fine wine. \u201cMore intermediates in the production of amphetamines and phenethylamines\u2026\u201d He pulled out a vial full of canary-yellow crystals and began deciphering the molecular structure on the label. \u201cThis is a diphenyl\u2026\u201d I craned my neck over the vial, totally hypnotized until Shulgin exclaimed, \u201cLet\u2019s go and have some lunch!\u201d Paul stayed behind while we walked back to the house and I enjoyed a piping-hot pizza with Ann, while Shulgin opted for an egg-salad-on-white-bread sandwich. It was a very casual, nervous, and astonishing midsummer lunch with the greatest psychedelic chemist in the world. Suddenly Paul burst into the room, short of breath: \u201cA team of scientists in Japan just discovered a 12-step total synthesis of Salvinorin A!\u201d Everybody began to murmur; Shulgin was impressed. \u201cOh my, that\u2019s a difficult one,\u201d he said. \u201cA real treasure of symmetry. You know, Salvinorin has 128 possible isomers.\u201d I wished the day would never end.I sat looking at (and possibly ogling) Shulgin chewing his egg-salad sandwich and thought about the superhuman influence his work endued on the world. The hundreds of deaths, millions of freak-outs, tens of billions of dollars exchanged of which he has not received a dime, cumulative millennia of prison sentences, trillions of transformative experiences, decaliters of joy tears, decibels of laughter, and so forth. I wanted to tell him how much he has changed my life; I wanted to offer him 1,000 screaming genuflections of gratitude for everything that has happened to me on substances he has created and championed. My bed collapsing while I was on 2C-B. Being cradled like a child by a computer programmer as I lay dying on DOC. Biting a crisp Red Delicious in the seminary on 2C-E. Finding a nippy jug of milk on a stoop and being attacked by a dog on DiPT. The Central Park portrait artist who drew me as if I were Enrique Iglesias on 4-HO-MiPT. Memorizing the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram on 2C-D. Burying my face in a sopping-wet wig I found on the floor of a taxi on 4-HO-MET. These were all holy and wonderful things that I wanted to tell him. I would not be capable of giving him enough thanks.Near the end of our meeting, I asked whether I could look through the lab once more while the Shulgins finished their meal. I was granted permission and went back to touch and smell and examine things in silence. There may be empty slots in the green boxes where the 5-MeO-DiPT, 2C-B, DOB, and DOM once stood\u2014they are the scars that his collection bears\u2014but there is no way to retract a molecule. The fact that he has created these chemicals and published their syntheses ensures their survival. It\u2019s no wonder he is still tripping at 84. In fact, he said that his newest creation, 5-MeO-MALT, is showing activity at 1.8 mg, which suggests it may be quite potent. But he also said that, as he has grown older, the dose required to produce an effect has decreased significantly. \u201cThreshold effects?\u201d I asked. He pauses for a moment. \u201cOh, \u2018effects.\u2019 I thought you said \u2018sex\u2019!\u201dIf, indeed, this non-interview was Shulgin\u2019s last interview, it left me partially unfulfilled. I still have so many questions. But my visit with the Shulgins made me realize that maybe it\u2019s time to answer my own questions. Which is fair and good, a gift even. He has, after all, answered more than enough. Regardless, it was difficult for me to leave his lab. I wanted to hide in the trash can or climb a tree; I really didn\u2019t want this story to end. ||||| It's quite a trip to visit maverick pharmacologist Dr Alexander Shulgin and his collaborator and wife, Ann, at their rustic home in California. It is a warm secluded place far from the UK's current controversy over drugs, fuelled by newspaper campaigns to legalise cannabis backed by Richard Branson, by Kevin Williamson's book Drugs And The Party Line (a scathing attack on drugs policy printed on hemp) and the Scotland Against Drugs campaign. \n \n Sasha Shulgin, as he introduces himself, is the proud godfather of Ecstasy, the hit drug of so many raves. A respected chemist, his relationship with the substance started surprisingly long ago, in the 1970s, when a colleague sent him the 1912 German patent for what was then a little-known drug called methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). He synthesised and tested the orphan compound - Merck, the drug company, had never used it commercially - and has been raving about it ever since. Three years ago, for example, it was Sasha's expert testimony that led Spanish authorities to categorise it as one of the least harmful drugs. \n \n Sasha has invented about a hundred other mind-altering substances, no mean feat since there may only be around 200 synthetics out there, not counting nature's own hallucinogens - magic mushrooms, peyote cacti, toad venom and the red beans of the Arizona and New Mexico Indians, among others. And for decades Sasha, 72, and Ann, a 66-year-old writer and researcher originally from New Zealand, have also imbibed psychedelics. In the name of science, they have taken assiduous notes on their trips, especially the benefits, ranging from increased self-awareness, compassion or spirituality to relaxation and great sex. \n \n Indeed their 'Farm,' as they jokingly call the shambolic place, has been the site of years of radical group research. After they had worked up a new mind-expanding compound, they would bring in eight or so fellow believers - from physicians to psychologists, scientists to businessmen - to test it and record their reactions. Until recently, however, the Shulgins were barely known beyond the world of government-controlled psycho-pharmacology. \n \n Their white wooden home, with a panoramic view to the east, sits atop the dry hills that stretch inland from the college town of Berkeley. Suburban drivers whiz down the four-lane road at the end of narrow Shulgin Road, so named because Sasha's family has owned the land since leaving Russia 50-odd years ago. \n \n For more than 15 years, Sasha held a rare government licence allowing him to study and synthesise illegal drugs. He has testified as an expert on both sides of drug trials and wrote the classic reference book on US law and drugs, Controlled Substances: Chemical And Legal Guide To Federal Drug Laws. Then, six years ago, and to the dismay of the authorities, the Shulgins declared their love of psychedelics and belief that all drugs should be legal. \n \n Adamant that their life's work should never disappear, they published a landmark book, the 1,000-page, oddly-titled Pihkal: A Chemical Love Story. The acronym stands for Phenethylamines I Have Known And Loved, and refers to a drug family that includes Sasha's beloved and already-illegal Ecstasy or MDMA. It contains recipes for 180 mind-bending chemicals and notes on the 'highs', often with artistic references and Ann's Jungian take on experience. Pihkal gained a cult readership, although the recipes are gobbledygook for amateurs. In its third print run, it has sold more than 21,000 copies, which is remarkable for a self-published book. \n \n The Shulgins are now in the news again. To the fury of drug officials on both sides of the Atlantic, they have just published a second book, Tihkal: The Continuation, which covers the 'tryptamines' from toad venom and magic mushrooms to LSD. In the first month, they sold 3,500 copies through their Transform Press in Berkeley, a figure boosted by a rave review in New York's Village Voice. At a certain point, they say they will simply publish it on the Internet as they did with Pihkal. Their aim is not to make money but to release the psychedelic genie from the bottle by disseminating their know-how irreversibly. They give copies out, only asking you to pass them on to others who might be interested. 'It can't be exterminated now,' says Sasha. \n \n Perhaps it's not surprising that the late Timothy Leary said the Shulgins are among the century's most important scientists. And Albert Hofmann, the inventor of LSD, is a friend with whom Sasha co-wrote the introduction to a 1977 book on hallucinogens by Aldous Huxley entitled Moksha, from the Hindu term for spiritual awakening. \n \n Drug-induced states, argue Sasha and Ann, are so intrinsic to human nature that the use of intoxicants such as tobacco, opium, cannabis, coffee or alcohol can be traced back to the dawn of time. They advocate legalising all drugs, addictive or not. It should be a matter for personal choice, they say, something that is taxed but as available as tobacco and booze. Drug-related crime would drop, drug-fighting money would be saved and drug use might even fall without the attraction of illicitness. The only laws needed, Sasha says, would be to prevent people driving when high, drugging someone else without their permission, or giving substances to children. Drug users who get into trouble should be helped, not treated like criminals, adds Ann, as are people addicted to valium or alcohol. \n \n Shulgin with his wife Ann at their home in Lafayette, California, USA in 2002. Photograph: Anthony Pidgeon/Redferns \n \n Has this argument become truly prophetic, a much-needed scientifically-informed salvo in a one-sided debate? Perhaps spiritual awakening, relaxation and chemical freedom should be within everyone's grasp, especially since life is so harsh. Or is the Shulgins' view well-intentioned but irresponsible - a sort of heroin chic for middle-class libertarians, another take on Andre Breton's 'derangement of the senses' from two utterly charming but idiosyncratic advocates? After all William Burroughs, trying to kick junk, tracked down the psychedelic 'ayahuasca' in South America in the hopes of substituting a new addiction. The 'yage' ceremonies were like night-long raves. But he later asked if dropping acid is like opening a door: once you've found it why keep reopening it over and over again? On a sunny afternoon, Sasha and Ann serve sandwiches and cake on their patio. In the middle of the table, next to the potato salad, is a Bolivian cactus growing in a pot. It's hallucinogenic rather than decorative, something you learn is true of almost every plant within a stone's throw of their house. \n \n Sasha's pharmaceutical calling came in, of all places, Liverpool. Two decades before the psychedelia of the 1960s, his epiphany was nothing to do with the Beatles' Yellow Submarine or Lucy In The Sky with Diamonds. He was in the US navy and had been whisked to hospital for an emergency operation. 'Goofed up' on Royal Navy rum, morphine and a barbiturates, he says he was given orange juice and was so convinced he was being re-drugged, he fell unconsciousness for too long. 'It was the ultimate placebo effect,' he recalls excitedly. 'I got interested in how you can modify the mind, how you can find out what's going on.' For years, Sasha worked as a scientist at Dow Chemical, although he had taken a psychedelic, mescaline, back in the 1950s. 'I saw colours I had never seen before,' he says. \n \n Ann, who experimented with mescaline-laced peyote at around the same time, adds: 'It opens up doors you wouldn't even know were there otherwise. It was a very extraordinary, sacred experience - everything you look at is infused with light.' On the way to Sasha's laboratory, he points out an acacia tree with psycho-active bark - DMT, often the source for an intoxicating snuff in the Caribbean and South America - and a mint used by Mexican Indians that he says often gives the user an 'out of body' or astral experience. \n \n His lab is cobweb-entangled and autumn leaves are piled in the corners. Drawers are crammed with beakers and test-tubes. On the wall near an old fireplace is a Voodoo doll Sasha says he uses to invoke a certain copper reaction. \n \n What about bad trips? I ask 'Oh, they're real,' he replies. 'Even in the research group, we'd have idiosyncratically-sensitive people.' Once, a friend became temporarily paralysed on one of Sasha's creations, 5-TOM. 'A pretty heavy-duty experience,' says PIHKAL. 'The consensus is that it wasn't worth the struggle.' The war on drugs, he says, is a waste of money, more to do with political control, profit-making and fear of the unknown than medical or social concerns. 'Is MDMA a dangerous drug?' he fumes. 'It's been used so much in the UK, and there's been one death in a million.' 'Recreational' heroin at your local off-licence? 'It's highly addictive, but perhaps not quite as much as tobacco,' he says. \n \n Think about recreation, says Ann. 'Re-creation. Young people grow up in big cities, they have to be so street-wise and untrusting. At a rave, that can drop away, leaving a sense of sharing and commitment with people they just met.' As if on cue, one of their fellow researchers drops by. Tony Sargent is a retired chemist who used to run radiology experiments at the respected Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. He's now a wine-maker, and is dressed with a casual conservatism- quite a contrast to Sasha with his Einstein hair and baggy ethnic-patterned shirt. They talk about psychedelics and how pharmacologists used to describe them as creating a temporary psychosis. Sasha is recalling a scan on the brain activity of schizophrenics, or 'schitzies' as he calls them. But surely you can't liken taking a drug voluntarily to a psychosis that can condemn someone to a life of isolation? Later, Ann will announce that a new crate of cacti has arrived. One of the Shulgins' means of staying ahead of the authorities is to work with psycho-active substances that are not yet categorised or outlawed. They are preparing their third book, tentatively called Qihkal, the 'Q' standing for quinolines, the hallucinogenic substance in cacti. Since many of the plants originate in Central or South America, they are not properly classified by Western botanists let alone pharmacologists. \n \n A few days later, we talk on the phone. The Shulgins are excited about reports from a forum for police on 'more pragmatic approaches' to substance abuse at the conservative Hoover Institution, at Stanford University. Former Secretary of State George Shultz and Nobel economist Milton Friedman had told the police that America's war on drugs is a failure that has led to massive, cruel imprisonment, inner-city destruction and widespread drug gangs that thrive on high profits and violence. \n \n For all their shamanistic talk, the Shulgins have experienced the war on drugs first-hand. Twice in 1994, US agents searched their home and lab, in part because drug officials were livid about the publication of Pihkal. Unable to halt the Shulgins' books because of the First Amendment, the authorities instead fined them Dollars 25,000 and made Sasha relinquish his drug-handling licence. \n \n They might have had cold feet sooner had they known his dedication. Sasha estimates he has popped 200 or so psychedelics not of his own invention. And he has invented 100 or so psychedelics, some potent enough to get street credibility or to be used by maverick psychotherapists - 2C-B, DOM or STP, the now-illegal DOB and DOI. Ethical and sincere in his beliefs, Sasha tried them first on himself, as did Hofmann with LSD and Salk with the polio vaccine. With a subversive-sounding chuckle, he makes a final charming quip: 'Oh, so many drugs and so little time.' So little time indeed, and there must quite a few out there who wish his calling were inventing a vaccine for Aids. ||||| Alexander \"Sasha\" Shulgin, psychedelic pioneer, RIP \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Alexander \"Sasha\" Shulgin, maverick chemist, psychedelic pioneer, and inspiring human being, died yesterday at 88 years old.

    "document": "cable news news Keith Olbermann Has Reportedly Been Negotiating His Exit for a While \n \n After Keith Olbermann suddenly announced his departure last night, some speculated that the impending NBC-Comcast merger played a role. NBC executives quickly denied any Comcast involvement in the decision. But how did it all really go down? Details are trickling in, and early anonymous sources say Olbermann was not flat-out fired. However, most outlets are also reporting that Olbermann and network brass have long been butting heads. \n \n According to TMZ, the exit was partially about money: \"Olbermann's agent went to NBC complaining that Keith was underpaid,\" the site reports. \"NBC execs told Olbermann's agent they would not cough up more money. Network execs were well aware that Comcast wanted Keith gone because he was 'a loose cannon that could not be controlled.' It became clear to both sides that Olbermann's days were numbered and they began negotiating an exit, completed just before airtime Friday night.\" Under the deal, Olbermann is allegedly barred from appearing on television for a certain period of time, but he will reappear soon with \"a presence on the Internet,\" where all fugitives of the television end up. \n \n Deadline reports a similar story: \"This was all Keith's choice. He has said several times over the years said that he wants out of his contract.\" The site says he began negotiating his out a few months ago, but, \"because of all the false threats in the past, it was impossible for the network to know if he was really going to sign the final document.\" Even his own staff learned he was quitting when they heard him say it on TV. \n \n And the New York Times concurs that NBC and Olbermann have been in negotiations to end Olbermann's run for weeks. The Times notes: \"Mr. Olbermann had butted heads with his superiors long before the Comcast deal, including Phil Griffin, the top MSNBC executive ... and NBC\u2019s management had been close to firing Mr. Olbermann before.\" One executive said Comcast \"dreaded the prospect\" of being blamed if Olbermann were to quit soon after the takeover. \n \n Only the New York Post reported that Olberamnn was \"unceremoniously dumped,\" but the paper also repeatedly refers to him as \"a garrulous gasbag.\" So. ||||| The ball was chopped slowly and to get the out the first baseman would have to pick it up barehanded in the grass corner between the foul line and the infield dirt. The pitcher would have to hustle over but as the game\u2019s most abused cliche reminds us every 43 minutes, that\u2019s why they have PFP in spring training. With a speedy runner it would still be close but this was the majors and he who executes best laughs last. \n \n The fans at Yankee Stadium didn\u2019t think twice about it when it happened in the top of the fourth yesterday. The play was difficult, but the pitcher was CC Sabathia and his hustle and athleticism have been one of the under-publicized aspects of the franchise\u2019s success since 2009. And of course, the New York first baseman for exactly the same length of time has been Mark Teixeira and the goaltender-like whip-lash catches he makes at the bag and his other defensive wizardry obscures the fact that if that comparatively ordinary slow chopper is hit to him 500 times over a decade he\u2019s going to pick it cleanly at least 499 times. \n \n Except the Yankee first baseman yesterday wasn\u2019t Teixeira, it was Kevin Youkilis. And no offense to Kevin Youkilis, but when he reached down to scoop up the Jose Iglesias chop and toss it to Sabathia for the out he got nothing but grass and air. \n \n An inning later Jarrod Saltalamacchia shot one into the corner in left, where Brett Gardner should have made an adroit pick-up of the ball as it rattled around. Except Gardner was in center because like Teixeira, Curtis Granderson is hurt and it was Vernon Wells. And no offense to Vernon Wells, but when he waited for the straight bounce off the fence that never comes out there, it didn\u2019t come, and he was left to play \u2018go chase\u2019 for awhile. All things considered Saltalamacchia probably would\u2019ve gotten a double out of it anyway but there would have been a play and every tenth or twentieth time \u2013 an out. \n \n In neither case did the Red Sox score. But those two plays alone added ten pitches or more to Sabathia\u2019s count and send him packing after five innings down 4-to-2, which opened things for the Yankee bullpen, which may be the least recognized problem among the cascade of them that started yesterday, and soon it would 5-to-2 and then 8-to-2 and then just as in \u201cYoung Frankenstein,\u201d it got worse \u2013 it started raining. \n \n The effect on the offense of the subtraction of Teixeira, Granderson, Derek Jeter, and even Alex Rodriguez is obvious. What will kill the Yankees \u2013 and I mean last place kill the Yankees; this is not the collapse of 1965, that was last year in the ALCS, this is 1966 \u2013 will be its effect on the defense. Bad defense is not only its own punishment but it makes bums out of the best of the pitchers. And to re-use yet another old joke, kid, these aren\u2019t the best of them. \n \n And much of this mess will never show up in the box score. The Iglesias and Saltalamacchia plays were both clearly to be scored base hits. Unfortunately this Yankee team \u2013 the Muddlers\u2019 Row of Brennan Boesch, Ben Francisco, Travis Hafner, Lyle Overbay, Wells, and Youkilis \u2013 has been assembled through (in the memorable phrase of the equally memorable San Francisco baseball writer Hank Schulman) dumpster-diving. And defensively they\u2019re just bad enough to not make the plays, but just good enough to not get the errors. \n \n It\u2019s hard to say how this impending disaster will be received in the Bronx. The Yankees haven\u2019t had a losing season since 1992 and they\u2019ve either won or been in contention every year since 1993. Hal Steinbrenner was still at the University of Florida Business School then, and the Yankees could and often did draw half of what they draw these days. A front office with no memory of the Bad Old Days never mind experience with alleviating them is likely to panic and throw some babies out with the bathwater (heck, the Yankees began panicking about mild media criticism more than a year ago). And the front-running fans who have filled the place during these later glory years will not know what that they were seeing, and never fully realize the implications of the fact that their new platoon third baseman was guy who had been released by the Red Sox exactly a week ago today. \n \n Toronto: I\u2019m not one of those stick-in-the-muds who looked at the Dodgers last year and tut-tutted \u201cyou can\u2019t parachute in four new guys in mid-season and expect to form a team.\u201d I mean, for one thing I\u2019m an entirely different kind of stick-in-the-mud. But more importantly, that conclusion ignores the reality that the Giants have won two World Series while parachuting in four guys (last year) and five guys (2010). \n \n So my refusal to jump on the Bandwagon going doing Blue Jay Way is nothing about team chemistry or parachuting or trying to meld a team while competing or Jose Reyes\u2019s hamstrings on turf. I just think that the laudable effort to rebuild a once-great franchise has somewhat obscured some remaining problems \u2013 like a very average bullpen, very average production out of the DH spot, and trouble at third base until Brett Lawrie returns. \n \n Plus there\u2019s this little scandal from last year that sneaked in under everybody\u2019s radar. The big trade for the noble Cy Young Award winner R.A. Dickey? It came less than a year after Dickey became one of a handful of major league pitchers to admit to taking painkiller injections during the season (Jonathan Papelbon, Jon Lester, and Clay Buchholz were among the others). In Dickey\u2019s case this was 2011; I\u2019ve seen no reporting about him and the drug \u2013 Toradol \u2013 in 2012: \n \n Dickey is among the players who believe Toradol is more effective than taking over-the-counter pain pills. He said he believed the injections helped keep him on the field to pitch 2082/3 innings last season (2011), despite his injured foot. Some doctors, though, said athletes might believe Toradol to be more effective only because of the way it is commonly administered. \n \n The emphasis there was mine. \n \n Giving your starting pitcher a series of anti-inflammatory pain-dulling injections all seasons long is ok because the drug, while requiring a prescription, supposedly only has a slightly greater impact than a couple of Advil (injected directly into the source of your pain). Except, oh by the way, that pesky drug insert sheet references limiting its use to five days in pill form and two days for injections, and oh by the way in England physicians are instructed to start patients on Toradol only in a hospital, and oh by the way when Clay Buchholz was in a hospital with internal bleeding last June he said he thought his use of the drug contributed to his crisis and the fact that doctors had to transfuse him with three or four pints of blood. \n \n Dickey is hardly deserving of being the only one with a finger pointed at him. My understanding is there isn\u2019t a rotation in the majors that doesn\u2019t have at least one regular Toradol, and that some of them may be in new uniforms this year in part because of their teams\u2019 fears that the painkiller could mask necessary pain, the kind that warns you of impending injury. For as with any drug that dulls pain, or covers up muscular damage or exhaustion, or which neutralizes tiredness, the possibility is increased of sudden serious injury. You don\u2019t know you\u2019re hurting and you push it to far \u2013 and something snaps. \n \n In short, if a Toradol scandal, or a Prescription Drug scandal, breaks in baseball this year the guys on the record as (past) users are few and far between. And only one of them is a defending Cy Young Winner. \n \n Almost as an aside I also have doubts about the efficacy of Toronto\u2019s rotation. Dickey went from 8-13 in 2011 to 20-6 last year. His strikeouts soared from 134 to 230 in only 25 more innings. His offensive support went up 8/10ths of a run. I don\u2019t know if any of that is sustainable or repeatable this year \u2013 especially without the joy of facing pitchers every ninth batter. Tell me how much you\u2019re willing to rely on Mark Buehrle and Josh Johnson, to say nothing of Ricky Romero, currently of the Dunedin Blue Jays. \n \n Boston: The gift of Jackie Bradley being ready as much as a year early \u2013 and it is a gift, his at bats are those of a 10-year veteran who draws 100 walks every year \u2013 may hide some dubious free agent signings. When your key acquisition does so poorly on his physical that you (and he) agree to cut the deal from three years to one, that\u2019s a problem. When you are hoping that Jonny Gomes, Shane Victorino, and Ryan Dempster all had \u2018blips\u2019 last year, that\u2019s a lot of high-odds wagering. \n \n The Red Sox probably did themselves a favor by sacrificing the stability that was Adrian Gonzalez in order to offload the franchise-sinking contracts of Josh Beckett and Carl Crawford. But as has been noted elsewhere, they were left with a lot of contract room and not that many people to spend it on. Instead of a Josh Hamilton they went for \u201cClubhouse Guys\u201d \u2013 which is great for long road trips, flights, bus rides in traffic, rain delays, etc. \u2013 but rarely seems to be the corrective folks assume insomuch as the last time I checked the game was still played out on the field and very rarely in the clubhouse. \n \n Bradley, of course, is the real deal (though I\u2019ve never seen a player whose Dad didn\u2019t reach the majors use the \u201cjunior\u201d on his uni \u2013 his reads \u201cBRADLEY JR.\u201d). Will Middlebrooks is legit too. If Jacoby Ellsbury and Dustin Pedroia stay healthy that\u2019s four of nine positions that will excel offensively and defensively. But with David Ortiz hurt and presumably waning there is no longer a feared hitter in this line-up and given the depth of this division that\u2019s a serious impediment to contention. \n \n Baltimore: As mentioned in the AL Central preview the Orioles could\u2019ve easily offed the Yankees in the ALDS last year even though they were relying on two outfielders \u2013 Lew Ford and Nate McLouth \u2013 who had been released earlier in the same season (Ford, by a team in an independent league). The O\u2019s were reshaped by two guys who were largely viewed as having been bypassed by the proverbial parade, Buck Showalter and Dan Duquette, and featured the contributions of only a couple of homegrown guys (Markakis, Machado, Wieters, Jim Johnson). \n \n What becomes of the Orioles when the revivified farm system begins to contribute? Dylan Bundy was arguably the game\u2019s top pitching prospect, until this spring when he was bypassed by his teammate Kevin Gausman. Will they step into the rotation or be used out of the bullpen a la David Price? Could WBC-tested infielder Jonathan Schoop help out? Or outfielder L.J. Hoes? Could any American League team add more key parts from its own farm system as 2013 rolls along? \n \n Tampa Bay: Well, yeah, actually. \n \n Even while trading off Wade Davis and James Shields, the Rays still have a complete back-up rotation (Jeff Niemann in the bullpen, Chris Archer, Jake Odorizzi, Mike Montgomery, and Alex Colome in the minors) to say nothing of a Cy Young Winner (David Price) and two possible future candidates (Jeremy Hellickson and Matt Moore) at the front of Plan A. \n \n And if the primary bounty in the Shields trade, Wil Myers, is not summoned into the Tampa line-up it will only be because of injury, or because the traditional small-ball line-up is producing satisfactorily and there\u2019s no need to squeeze out James Loney or the platooners at second or DH. \n \n The key Tampa weakness would seem to be behind the plate. They kept Jose Molina intact enough to appear in 102 games last year and one wonders if that can be done again, or if Jose Lobaton is a satisfactory alternative. There isn\u2019t a catching prospect in the system and despite the sense that the Rays hit the bullseye with every one of their very few economic darts, the minors are thin generally in terms of position players (2009 was a bad draft, and every year that passes makes the 2008 selection of Tim Beckham as the overall number one pick instead of some kid named Posey look that much sillier). But the arms keep appearing, the down-market free agent signings keep producing (you realize that Loney could out-hit his predecessor Carlos Pena by a hundred points and still not hit .300?), and the veterans get transformed either into more draft choices (or guys like Wil Myers. Good grief, the team with the thinnest tightrope in the sport was somehow able to trade for Wil Myers). Marc Topkin has a superb and concise explanation of how the Rays keep the machine turning here and I offer the usual disclaimer here that I went to college with the future Mrs. Stuart Sternberg and their oldest son was an intern for me one summer. \n \n The Division: I know this is viewed as a three, four, or even five team race. I just don\u2019t see anybody seriously challenging the Rays, especially when Myers comes up. I\u2019m not certain on whether the Orioles\u2019 Tampa-like structuring and youth flood can overcome the value of Toronto\u2019s mass additions in the race for second place; either way it\u2019ll be close. The Red Sox are not likely to compete but also not likely to be challenged by the Yankees who \u2013 even in the disaster of last place \u2013 will still be the division\u2019s lead story. \n \n Tomorrow we\u2019ll finish it up with the Tarot Card reading that those one-game wild cards make trying to predict the playoffs six months in advance. ||||| Keith Olbermann -- The Rich Get Richer \n \n Keith Olbermann -- The Rich Get Richer \n \n scored an even sweeter exit package than previously reported.

The Golden Globe-winning scribe behind The Social Network has long had a pilot script in the works about a cable news show, and Olbermann could be tapped to contribute rants, says a source familiar with the project. \n \n Sorkin spent time on Olbermann\u2019s set while penning the behind-the-scenes script (think Sports Night meets Countdown), something he did while juggling The Social Network and working on an early draft of the upcoming film Moneyball (starring Brad Pitt). Sorkin recently told BBC News that he also shadowed Chris Matthews and Fox News and that he\u2019s working with HBO on the project. (Unfortunately, the pay cabler is not confirming anything.) \n \n Any network giving serious consideration to Sorkin\u2019s next series may want to wait until Tuesday\u2019s Oscar nominations to make a bigger publicity splash since it seems all but guaranteed that Hollywood\u2019s premier scribe will snag a screenplay nod for The Social Network. Sorkin already won a Golden Globe for writing the movie, which was also recognized as the year\u2019s best drama flick by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. In addition, Sorkin scored a BATFTA nomination. \n \n Should the behind-the-scenes script become a series, it\u2019s practically a given that Sorkin would call upon his trusted allies to help carry out his vision. Besides Olbermann\u2019s potential contribution, Emmy-winning scribes like Kevin Falls (Franklin & Bash) and Eli Attie (House M.D.) \u2014 both of whom worked on The West Wing \u2013 could help Sorkin run the show, while Thomas Schlamme would be a natural to direct. And what do you say, Sorkin; how about Bradley Whitford as Olbermann\u2019s doppelganger? Stay tuned. ||||| Since joining Twitter early last year, now-former Countdown host Keith Olbermann has become one of the platform\u2019s most loquacious users, tweeting more frequently than a meth-tweaked canary. All of that came to an abrupt end in the hour before his Friday announcement that he, and his show, were leaving MSNBC. \n \n Saturday night, though, Olbermann-watchers saw the first sign of post-Countdown life from his Twitter feed: an update to his profile which read \u201cWATCHTHISSPACE MLB.com Baseball Nerd blog returns 2/14.\u201d \n \n At this point, very little should be read into this, but that won\u2019t stop people from trying. The New York Daily News speculates that maybe the update signifies a return to sports for the former Sportscenter co-anchor: \n \n Since his sudden split with MSNBC, Keith Olbermann could be going back to his roots \u2013 at least on Twitter. \u201cW A T C H T H I S S P A C E MLB.Com Baseball Nerd blog returns 2/14,\u201d he wrote on his biography line\u2013 the only update he\u2019s written on his usually prolific account since Friday evening. \n \n They go on to note that a return to ESPN is unlikely, for a variety of reasons that Sportsgrid details here. \n \n The problem here is that promoting the Baseball Nerd blog is nothing new to Olbermann\u2019s Twitter feed, and so \u201cWatch this space\u201d isn\u2019t necessarily related to it. If Olbermann does remain silent until February 14, though, you can bet that will be the most widely-read edition to date. \n \n In any case, those watching Olbermann\u2019s feed for dirty laundry, or laundry of any kind, regarding his departure from MSNBC are likely in for a big disappointment. As much as it\u2019s probably killing the normally-outspoken Olbermann, news accounts from respected journalists generally concur that the terms of his exit include some kind of gag order. \n \n Much more likely is the prospect that Olbermann will share, in fairly short order, some level of detail about his future plans. Ironically, his departure has elevated his Twitter feed to near-Sarah Palin status, anticipation-wise. The parallel has been noted by some conservatives on Twitter, who wondered if Olbermann could continue to slam Palin for resigning the Alaska Governorship, which caused Olbermann to dub Palin the \u201cformer Half-Governor.\u201d (This says more about their attitudes about the gravity of elected office than anything else.) \n \n In that vein, it would be a satirical masterstroke if Olbermann emerged from Twitter exile to tweet about \u201cDeath Panels,\u201d as they relate to cuts to transplant funding in Arizona. \n \n Either way, Olbermann has to be aware that his status as a Palin-level Twitter celebrity has a short shelf-life, and if he wants to use the platform to promote his next move, sooner is better than later. \n \n Update: On Sunday, perhaps in response to the Daily News\u2019 speculation, the message on Olbermann\u2019s Twitter profile was tweaked to more clearly separate the messages. It now reads \u201cW A T C H__________T H I S__________S P A C E (Also: MLB.Com Baseball Nerd blog returns 2/14)\u201d",

(Associated Press) \n \n The waters left behind tractor-trailers snapped in half, concrete slabs where houses used to be and a car hanging from a tree. \n \n The slow-motion inundation of Brisbane overnight _ played out live on television before a nation transfixed _ was a critical moment in flooding that has built for weeks as rain fell incessantly across Australia's tropical northeast. \n \n The emergency is not over, but Brisbane's escape from what forecasters had predicted would be a flood worse than one that laid waste to much of the city 37 years ago triggered relief nationwide. \n \n The death toll stood at 25, including a 24-year-old man who drowned Thursday when he was sucked into a storm drain as he tried to check on his father's home in a swamped Brisbane neighborhood. Officials said they expect to find more bodies farther upstream as they finally got access to hamlets struck by flash flooding on Monday. \n \n The deadly floodwaters began to recede Thursday after cresting about three feet (one meter) below the depth of 1974 floods that swept through Brisbane and set a benchmark for disaster. Still, 30,000 homes and business were swamped _ many all the way up to their terra-cotta roof tiles. Skyscrapers stood empty as downtown closed for a for a second day, and thousands remained huddled in evacuation centers or with friends and family on higher ground. \n \n \"Queensland is reeling this morning from the worst natural disaster in our history and possibly in the history of our nation,\" a visibly shaken state Premier Anna Bligh told reporters. \"We've seen three-quarters of our state having experienced the devastation of raging floodwaters and we now face a reconstruction task of postwar proportions.\" \n \n The flooding across Queensland has submerged dozens of towns _ some three times _ and left an area the size of Germany and France combined under water. Highways and rail lines have been washed away in the disaster, which is shaping up to be Australia's costliest. Damage estimates were already at $5 billion before the floodwaters swamped Brisbane. \n \n At least 61 people are still missing, most of them from around Toowoomba, a city west of Brisbane that saw massive flash floods on Monday. Fourteen died in that flood alone, including two whose bodies were found on Thursday. Deputy Police Commissioner Ian Stewart warned that number was likely to rise as search and rescue teams are able to move into more devastated areas. \n \n \"We've got to brace ourselves for more bad news,\" Stewart said. \n \n With decent access to the region between Brisbane and Toowoomba for the first time, more than 200 police and soldiers fanned out across the stricken Lockyer Valley in buses, helicopters and amphibious military vehicles on Thursday. \n \n At Postmans Ridge, about 55 miles (90 kilometers) west of Brisbane, about two dozen soldiers wearing jungle camouflage uniforms and police in dark coveralls picked their way methodically through large trees flattened along a creek banks and a floodplain strewn with debris. Tractor-trailers lay broken in two, boats were crushed and the body of a horse was wedged between a downed tree and the sodden ground. \n \n Nearby, Barry and Catherine Bull boiled potatoes and cooked rump steak given to them by a neighbor over a gas-fired camp stove set up outside their house, built of brick and one of few left standing around them. All that remains of the neighbor's wood-framed house is the concrete slab. A car was suspended in the sagging branches of a tree. \n \n They fear the elderly woman across the street is one of the people for whom the soldiers are searching. \n \n \"One of the neighbors went to get her, got her out of the house, but she went back for the dog,\" Catherine Bull said. \"That was the last anyone saw of her. If you'd seen the torrent and the way the water was moving, I think you know the rest.\" \n \n Officials told evacuated Brisbane residents it could be days before it was safe to return to inundated neighborhoods, though no bans were in place preventing people from surveying the damage. Some homes would never be habitable again. \n \n Mayor Campbell Newman said 11,900 homes and 2,500 businesses had been completely inundated, with another 14,700 houses and 2,500 businesses at least partially covered in water. \n \n Roads were flooded, railway lines were cut and sewage spilled into the floodwaters. People moved about in kayaks, rowboats and even on surfboards. \n \n Police officers were patrolling Brisbane's flooded streets around the clock. Three men were charged with looting after police said they tried to steal dinghies from the swollen river. \n \n Despite the devastation, many in Brisbane were thankful the river running through the city had spared them the worst of its fury. \n \n Lisa Sully, who lives in the nearby suburb of Sherwood, did have some water in her home _ but she still felt lucky on Thursday. \n \n \"I can handle this,\" she said. \"Mentally, I was prepared for worse.\" \n \n The death toll has shocked Australians, no strangers to deadly natural disasters such as the wildfires that killed 173 in a single day two years ago. \n \n Though the full extent of the damage won't be known until the water is gone, even before Brisbane was threatened, Bligh estimated a cleanup and rebuilding to total about $5 billion. \n \n Add to that, the damage to economy: Queensland's coal industry has virtually shut down, costing millions in deferred exports and sending global prices higher. Vegetables, fruit and sugarcane crops in the rich agricultural region have been wiped out, and prices are due to skyrocket as a result. ||||| Clive Palmer, the billionaire owner of mining company Mineralogy, initially ordered the helicopter to go to the aid of three staff members who were stuck on the roof of his horse stud farm in Kilcoy, 70 miles northwest of Brisbane. \n \n The remote property was inundated by flash floods and the emergency services had not yet responded to calls for help. \n \n The group had been unable to escape when a wall of water hit the property and were in danger of being swept away, he said. \n \n \"An extra metre and it would have got them. They were very lucky - they should have got a quicker response,\" he told the Courier Mail newspaper. \"The important lesson is we need fast reaction times and not slow ones.\" \n \n Mr Palmer said the group had called the emergency services, but 12 hours later when they had still not arrived, he decided to act. \n \n \"I made the call at four in the morning to get our guys in because we were worried they'd drown,\" he said. \n \n On the way back from picking up the employees, the helicopter passed over another 16 people, including several children, stranded on the roof of a local school. \n \n \"They'd been waiting for a day for an evacuation too, so our chopper went back and shuttled them all off,\" Mr Palmer said. \n \n By the end of the crisis, the helicopter had saved 60 people, employees said. \n \n Murray Sullivan, who was plucked from the roof of the horse stud, said he owed his life to Mr Palmer. \n \n \"I will never, ever forget what Clive did for me,\" he told racing website harnesslink.com. \n \n \"I will definitely be returning to work for him but for now I can't face what is there. The water has subsided but the thought of cleaning up the carcasses of horses I loved so much would be too much for me to take right now.\" \n \n Mr Palmer said he had lost around $1.8 million of farm equipment and about 20 horses had drowned in the flash flood. ||||| Web wide crawl with initial seedlist and crawler configuration from March 2011.

Sarah Ryley, the reporter on the series, who left The News last year, said it had taken three years to complete because she and the rest of the staff were stretched thin after the layoffs under Mr. Zuckerman. \n \n \u201cYou used to go into the office and feel the energy,\u201d said Frank Isola, a sports columnist at The News for nearly 25 years, who was among those laid off on Monday. \u201cI\u2019ve probably been in the office, I would say, maybe three times in the last three years.

It said the moves were necessary to seize the opportunities of digital news and financial challenges ahead. A Tronc spokeswoman confirmed the veracity of the memo. \n \n Tronc said in the memo that the Daily News would be \"re-focusing much of our talent on breaking news \u2014 especially in areas of crime, civil justice and public responsibility.\" \n \n Tronc purchased the famed New York City tabloid last fall for $1 in a reunion of sorts; the paper was founded by Tronc's corporate predecessor, the Tribune Co., in 1919 and sold off in 1991. The Daily News endured waves of cuts under subsequent owners and declining paid circulation in recent years though it has remained on most lists of top 10 circulation papers in the U.S. \n \n Tronc is the owner of other papers in Chicago, Baltimore, Hartford, Florida, and Virginia, among others. Tronc's continuing cuts and shift in emphasizing quick-turn pieces for digital audiences led to successful unionization drives at both the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune, then its two largest papers, earlier this year. Tronc subsequently sold the LA Times. \n \n Last fall, the Chicago Tribune called Tronc's acquisition of the Daily News \"a stunning and bold bet on the future of newspapers.\" Tronc's CEO (and now chairman) Justin Dearborn said at the time, \"We expect it to benefit greatly from becoming part of the Tronc ecosystem.\" \n \n The move now to gut the Daily News's newsroom will be a blow to local watchdog journalism in the nation's largest city. It has retained a punch in local news at a time when the The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal have retreated from metro coverage. \n \n The Daily News won a Pulitzer Prize last year, its 11th, with ProPublica, for its exposure of how the New York Police Department used an obscure civil enforcement law to evict hundreds of poor people from their homes without their being able to challenge the move first. The paper has also made a meal of the Donald Trump presidency from the populist left, depicting the New York-based real estate developer, long familiar to readers of its gossip pages, as a malevolent, autocratic and cartoonish figure. \n \n Former Daily News editor-in-chief Jim Rich was rehired as the tabloid's editor after Tronc acquired it last September. Rich and Managing Editor Kristen Lee are out as part of the cuts. Rich made his anger toward the cuts known on Twitter, first by tweeting early Monday morning: \"If you hate democracy and think local governments should operate unchecked and in the dark, then today is a good day for you.\" \n \n He subsequently changed his Twitter bio to this: \"Just a guy sitting at home watching journalism being choked into extinction.\" \n \n Tronc has appointed a new editor-in-chief, Robert York, previously editor and publisher of the smaller Tronc sister paper, the Allentown (Pa.) Morning Call. \n \n Below is the Tronc memo: ||||| To put a twist on one of the most famous front pages in history: \u201cTronc to New York Daily News: Drop Dead!\u201d \n \n That\u2019s what it feels like today in the wake of the publisher\u2019s decision to lay off half the editorial staff at the storied tabloid, leaving a skeleton crew to run a newspaper that covers national news, issues, and events impacting the biggest city in the country.

Kaepernick\u2019s stance inspired a team meeting this morning in which Kaepernick and team leaders spoke. Based on what players said, the meeting prompted thoughtful discussion and provided a better understanding for some of what Kaepernick is attempting to accomplish. \n \n 49ERS STRUGGLING: Tickets going for half price \n \n It\u2019s probably safe to say many players don\u2019t agree with Kaepernick\u2019s anthem stance. That said, they respect his desire to highlight issues of police brutality and racial inequality, and his willingness to absorb the resulting avalanche of critcism. \n \n Here is a sampling of what players said: \n \n WR Torrey Smith \n \n \u201cI know he\u2019s taking a lot of heat for it. And he understands that when you do something like that, it does offend a lot of people. When I think of the national anthem, I think of soldiers. Soldiers that have died for our rights, and a right that he exercised. So I get why people are mad. I\u2019m not (as) focused on how he did it, but the message he\u2019s trying to send is important. We have real issues in society that need to be addressed. That was his way of standing up for it. I respect his right. Again, whether I agree with what he did or not - that\u2019s not something I would do, but he did it.\u201d \n \n ********************* \n \n \u201cWhen I think of the national anthem, I think of soldiers who have passed away for our freedom. So that\u2019s not something that I would do. But I understand that Kap has absolutely nothing against soldiers. It\u2019s about the state of where we are as a country. Standing up for that. I don\u2019t think he meant to offend any soldiers. I don\u2019t mean to speak for him, but just knowing him, and how he\u2019s been with soldiers and the appreciation he\u2019s shown for them, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not what he meant by it.\u201d \n \n ********************* \n \n \u201cI think everyone has a right to stand up for what they believe in. I respect that, first and foremost, whether I agree with what he did and the way he did it, that\u2019s not for me. He has that right. Solders will die for his right to do exactly what he did.\u201d \n \n ********************* \n \n \u201cOftentimes people want athletes to take a stand.

I believe enough is enough. I do see where people think it\u2019s bad with the national anthem and the military. For me, personally, I\u2019m going to stand there every time. I\u2019m going to think about and honor those who are fighting. Those who have fought: my family members, my friends.

It was impressive.\u201d \n \n Twitter: @Eric_Branch ||||| SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick sat during the national anthem in each of the team's three preseason games and said he plans to continue to do so until he sees real change when it comes to racial oppression in the United States. \n \n \"Yes, I'll continue to sit,\" Kaepernick said. \"I'm going to continue to stand with the people that are being oppressed. To me this is something that has to change. When there's significant change and I feel like that flag represents what it's supposed to represent, this country is representing people the way that it's supposed to, I'll stand.\" \n \n On Sunday afternoon, Kaepernick spent nearly 20 minutes addressing reporters for the first time since he was spotted sitting between two Gatorade jugs during the national anthem before Friday's game against the Green Bay Packers. \n \n Clearly aware of the backlash he's received since his stance became public, Kaepernick made it a point to clarify that he has nothing against the military. \n \n \"I do think that the talk has been more about me, more about I know a lot of people's initial reactions thought it was bashing the military, which it wasn't,\" Kaepernick said. \"That wasn't my intention at all. I think now that we have those things cleared up, we can get to the root of what I was saying and really address those issues.\" \n \n During the extensive interview, Kaepernick covered a variety of subjects, ranging from his reasoning behind sitting to whether he'll fear for his safety on the road this year to the presidential election. \n \n Kaepernick said his decision to make his stance has been a long time coming and was born of years of both witnessing and being a part of racial oppression. \n \n \"It's something that I've seen, I've felt, wasn't quite sure how to deal with originally,\" Kaepernick said. \"And it is something that's evolved. It's something that as I've gained more knowledge about, what's gone on in this country in the past, what's going on currently. These aren't new situations. This isn't new ground. There are things that have gone on in this country for years and years and have never been addressed, and they need to be.\" \n \n Asked to offer some specifics, Kaepernick cited police brutality in a number of cities that have resulted in the deaths of black men. \n \n Kaepernick recounted a story of one of his college roommates moving out of their house, and because he and his roommates were the only black people in the neighborhood, the police came and drew guns on them. \n \n \"I do think that the talk has been more about me, more about I know a lot of people's initial reactions thought it was bashing the military, which it wasn't. That wasn't my intention at all. I think now that we have those things cleared up, we can get to the root of what I was saying and really address those issues.\" 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick \n \n \"I have experienced this,\" Kaepernick said. \"People close to me have experienced this. This isn't something that's a one-off case here or a one-off case there. This has become habitual. This has become a habit. So this is something that needs to be addressed.\" \n \n Kaepernick said his decision to sit also wasn't made spur of the moment. He cited conversations with other players and influential people, such as Dr. Harry Edwards, as taking place in the time before taking action. \n \n Dr. Edwards, who was instrumental in the protest by U.S. Olympians Tommie Smith and John Carlos at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, is a 49ers team consultant and shared a hug and brief conversation with Kaepernick before Sunday's practice. \n \n Kaepernick also addressed the team at a players-only meeting that took place Sunday morning. \n \n \"They asked me to talk and just explain why I did what I did,\" Kaepernick said. \"And why I felt the way I felt. I had an open conversation with them. I told them why I felt that way and looked at things the way I do. A lot of it has to do with the history of the country and where we're currently at. I opened it up to all my teammates. Come talk to me if you have any questions. If you want to understand what I'm thinking further, come talk to me. It shouldn't be something that should be hidden. These conversations need to happen and can bring everybody closer.\" \n \n Kaepernick said he has no plans to try to get other players to join him in his protest, citing the attention that goes with making such a move. \n \n \"This isn't something I'm going to ask other people to put their necks out for what I'm doing,\" Kaepernick said. \"If they agree with me and feel strongly about it, then by all means I hope they stand with me. But I'm not going to go and try to recruit people and be like 'Hey, come do this with me' because I know the consequences that come with that, and they need to make that decision for themselves.\" \n \n As for the timing of the protest, Kaepernick said he didn't choose now simply because it's an election year, but he did voice his displeasure with the two presidential candidates. \n \n \"You have Hillary [Clinton], who has called black teens or black kids superpredators,\" Kaepernick said. \"You have Donald Trump, who is openly racist. We have a presidential candidate [Clinton] who has deleted emails and done things illegally and is a presidential candidate. That doesn't make sense to me. If that was any other person, you'd be in prison. So what is this country really standing for?\" \n \n From a football perspective, Kaepernick said he wants the team focus to be on winning games, but that there's also a time to discuss social issues. Asked whether he thought he could be cut for taking this stance, Kaepernick didn't seem concerned. \n \n \"I don't know,\" Kaepernick said. \"But if I do, I know I did what's right. And I can live with that at the end of the day.\" \n \n Kaepernick also said he has no concerns about potential backlash when he plays in road games this year. \n \n \"At the end of the day, if something happens, that's only proving my point,\" Kaepernick said. \n \n As to where he goes from here, while Kaepernick continues to sit during the anthem, he says there are also plans to do more than symbolically protest. \n \n \"There are things that I have in the works right now that I'm working on to put together in the future and have come to fruition soon,\" Kaepernick said. \"Those are things that I'll talk about as we get closer to those days.\"",

    "document": "Alan Dershowitz may not want to jump aboard Donald Trump's legal team, but apparently, he has no qualms with advising Harvey Weinstein's legal team. \n \n On Thursday, Weinstein continued his bid in Delaware Bankruptcy Court to obtain personal and business records kept by The Weinstein Co. The movie mogul is currently facing investigation by law enforcement authorities over allegations of sexual misconduct. For months, he's been in court and in arbitration without success in an effort to obtain old emails. He believes the material will allow him to \"exonerate himself.\" \n \n In new court papers, Weinstein's attorneys repeat their claims that due process rights are being violated. Plus, it's argued that Weinstein should get the benefit of discovery to see if any property for sale belongs to him. \n \n What's substantively new here is a declaration from Dershowitz, a Harvard Law professor who is a frequent legal commentator on CNN and Fox News. The former O.J. Simpson defense attorney has been especially vocal of late on the investigation into Russian collusion in the election and sat down to dinner with Trump recently. He was reportedly asked to join the president's team. That didn't happen, but he's interested in Weinstein too. \n \n \"I have been retained to consult with Benjamin Brafman, Esquire who is representing Harvey Weinstein,\" he states in a declaration. \"I have agreed to consult on the specific issue of Mr. Brafman\u2019s access to his client\u2019s personal and business emails. On information and belief, it is my professional opinion that Mr. Brafman has the right to see and review these emails in order to prepare his constitutionally-mandated role as counsel to Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Brafman has the right to defend his client in the courts of law, in negotiations with prosecutors, in resolving civil claims in negotiation with civil lawyers and in the court of public opinion. On information and belief these emails contain information which is exculpatory of Mr. Brafman\u2019s client and places the allegations against him in a truthful context.\" \n \n Although Dershowitz says he is only a consultant, he also tells the judge he is prepared to offer a memorandum in support of Weinstein's bid for documents. ||||| Having never met a camera he didn\u2019t like nor a high-profile case that he couldn\u2019t contribute to, it should be no surprise that Alan Dershowitz has joined the cast of characters in The Weinstein Company bankruptcy case. \n \n Perhaps hoping to see another reversal of fortune, disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein has brought the cable new regular onboard as a consultant in the proceeding in U.S. Court in Delaware. \n \n \u201cIf Mr. Weinstein were ever to be charged with a crime, he would of course have a constitutional right to all of his emails and other exculpatory materials, under Brady, Giglio and their progeny,\u201d the Harvard Law professor said in a declaration submitted today with other material by Weinstein\u2019s lawyers (read it here). \n \n As he has in other cases, the much accused and investigated Weinstein is trying to grab ahold of his TWC correspondence and files as the company he co-founded goes through a death spiral of sorts. Following an expose by the New York Times in early October, Weinstein has been accused by dozens and dozens of women of sexual harassment and assault. He is presently being investigated by the NYPD, UK police and has seen the LAPD and the Beverley Hills Police submit findings to the LA County D.A. Earlier this week, Ashley Judd sued Weinstein on claims that he tried to torpedo her career because she wouldn\u2019t submit to his sexual advances. \n \n In that context and the straining bankruptcy, contrarian and once O.J. lawyer Dershowitz has leaped in \u2013 even as TWC said last month that Weinstein\u2019s document request has zero to do with the bankruptcy. A POV that Dershowitz rejects. \n \n \u201cI believe that his lawyer also has a constitutional right to these materials while there are ongoing criminal investigations in order to present prosecutors with exculpatory information that could persuade them not to bring charges,\u201d Dershowitz adds in his declaration Thursday. \u201cMoreover, basic fairness dictates that Mr. Brafman be given exculpatory information now rather than later, since such information could prevent false charges from being filed,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe exculpatory emails have no legitimate commercial value to the bankrupt company. Their only value \u2013 and it is not commercial \u2013 is to Mr. Brafman and his client in their efforts to achieve justice.\u201d \n \n \u201cIf helpful to the Court, at the appropriate time I will prepare a memorandum of law providing legal support for the claims made above,\u201d Dershowitz declares, already casting a bigger role for himself, unsurprisingly. \n \n And the circus goes on.",

    "document": "Summary \n \n Investigative Highlights \n \n State employees and agencies engaged in various improper governmental activities, including the following: \n \n \u00bb Four employees at several agencies misused state time and cost the State approximately $160,000. \n \n Two employees either took extended breaks or left the premises over a five\u2011year period. \n \n \n \n One employee regularly left early from work over two years. \n \n \n \n One employee slept at her desk for extended periods of time during work hours. \n \n \u00bb A nursing director removed an LVN, who was her personal friend, from her assigned nursing position to perform duties typically performed by an office technician. \n \n \u00bb An official built an unauthorized structure on state property with the help of on\u2011duty staff under his command. \n \n Results in Brief \n \n The California Whistleblower Protection Act (Whistleblower Act) empowers the California State Auditor's Office (State Auditor) to investigate and report on improper governmental activities by agencies and employees of the State. Under the Whistleblower Act, an improper governmental activity includes any action by a state agency or employee related to state government that violates a law; is economically wasteful; or involves gross misconduct, incompetence, or inefficiency. \n \n From July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2018, the State Auditor conducted investigative work on 1,481 cases. This report contains seven examples of investigations that substantiated improper governmental activities, including misuse of state time and inaccurate attendance records, economically wasteful activities, and misuse of government property. In addition, during the past year, the State Auditor issued nonpublic reports regarding nepotism, bad-faith hires, improper promotions, and other misconduct by executive management within two state entities. It provided these reports to those who could remediate the problems and ensure that the management teams involved did not retaliate against perceived whistleblowers. \n \n California State University, Fresno \n \n Two facilities operations employees at California State University, Fresno engaged in egregious and continued time and attendance abuse by taking extended breaks or leaving campus without accounting for their time. From 2013 through 2017, two employees failed to account for more than 5,100 hours of work, costing the State more than $111,000 in salary paid for work not performed. Furthermore, the employees were dishonest in their attempts to conceal their time and attendance abuse. \n \n California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Kern Valley State Prison \n \n For about two years, an employee at Kern Valley State Prison misused state time by regularly leaving work up to 45 minutes early as a result of inadequate supervision. We estimated that the employee failed to account for 312 hours of missed work time, costing the State nearly $9,000. \n \n Department of Motor Vehicles \n \n A key data operator at the Department of Motor Vehicles failed to perform her essential duties over a period of nearly four years because she slept at her desk for extended periods of time during work hours. From February 2014 through December 2017, the employee misused more than 2,200 hours of work time as a result of sleeping on the job, costing the State more than $40,000. \n \n California Correctional Health Care Services \n \n From May 2015 through July 2016, a director of nursing (nursing director) at a Southern California adult prison removed a licensed vocational nurse (LVN), who was her personal friend, from her assigned nursing position\u2014or post\u2014providing patient care and reassigned her to perform nurse scheduling duties typically performed by an office technician. During this period, the LVN continued to receive her pay as a nurse even though she provided patient care only when she worked occasional overtime shifts, causing California Correctional Health Care Services (Correctional Health Care) to waste $10,500 in unnecessary salary payments. Furthermore, the nursing director's decision cost the State an additional $18,700 in unnecessary overtime payments that Correctional Health Care paid to other nurses to cover the LVN's originally assigned post, resulting in total waste of nearly $30,000. \n \n California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation \n \n The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) overpaid a staff services analyst (analyst) at one of its prisons nearly $3,000 from July 2016 through March 2017. The analyst, her manager, an associate warden, and a personnel specialist all failed to follow CDCR procedure and the California Department of Human Resources' policy regarding inmate supervision pay, which resulted in the overpayments. In addition, the associate warden violated state law by choosing not to initiate any collection efforts after two internal audits in 2017 documented the error in pay and recommended the recovery of the overpayments. \n \n California State University, Dominguez Hills \n \n In March 2013, a manager at California State University, Dominguez Hills directed a member of his staff to purchase a Nissan-manufactured electric vehicle quick charger for nearly $7,000 before the manager had performed the due diligence necessary to ensure that the equipment was compatible with the energy resource plan for the campus. The quick charger has remained unused for five years, its warranty lapsed in 2014, and Nissan is no longer manufacturing replacement parts. As of February 2018, the campus told us it will be unable to install the quick charger before 2020 or 2021, if at all. \n \n California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection \n \n A California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) assistant chief misused state resources when he violated his rental agreement by building an unauthorized structure on state property using on-duty staff under his command. In 2016 the assistant chief built a 16-foot-by-20-foot structure with plumbing, electrical, and sewer connections in the backyard of the state residence he rented from CAL FIRE without written approval from CAL FIRE to build the structure as his rental agreement required. He also did not have approval from the Office of the State Fire Marshal, which is responsible for inspecting state\u2011owned buildings. \n \n Footnote \n \n For more information about the State Auditor's investigations program, please refer to the Appendix.

It says the work the employee did complete \"was often so inaccurate\" that coworkers wouldn't trust her to correctly enter their address or vehicle ownership change. \n \n Supervisors suspected a medical issue was contributing to the employee's problems, which led them to be \"reluctant to take further steps to address the employee\u2019s sleeping and poor production.\" \n \n The employee's doctor told the DMV she was unable to perform the duties associated with her job. Subsequently, the employee obtained a physician's release saying she was able to perform her job's duties, the report says. \n \n Earlier this year, the DMV said it was unable to proceed with disciplinary action because the issues had not been adequately documented.

    "document": "A supporter of Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump, wears a Trump mask as he dances in the aisle before a town hall Saturday, April 2, 2016, in Rothschild, Wis. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast) (Associated Press) \n \n RACINE, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Following one of the worst weeks of his campaign, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was on defense Saturday as he kicked off a three-day sprint to Wisconsin's primary. \n \n Trump began the afternoon with a rally in the Milwaukee suburb of Racine, where he defended a series of controversial comments in recent days on NATO, abortion and nuclear weapons. \n \n \"This politics is a tough business,\" said Trump, whose performance in Tuesday's contest will help determine whether he can seize the Republican nomination without a fight at the convention. \"Because you can say things one way and the press will criticize you horribly. You say it another way and the press will criticize you horribly.\" \n \n Offstage, Trump expressed regret that he had retweeted an unflattering photo of rival Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi, paired with a glamorous photo of his own wife, Melania, as part of a bitter feud between the two men. \n \n \"Yeah, it was a mistake,\" he told New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd. \"If I had to do it again, I wouldn't have sent it.\" \n \n Among his biggest missteps have been Trump's recent comments on abortion, which have managed to unite both abortion rights activists and opponents in their criticism. \n \n During a taping of \"Face The Nation\" on Friday, Trump said he believed that, when it comes to abortion: \"The laws are set. And I think we have to leave it that way.\" His spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, quickly issued a clarification that Trump meant that laws won't change until he's president and appoints judges who can interpret them differently. \n \n It was the second time in days that he'd stepped in hot water over the issue.

Icahn knocking on its front door, Netflix has put up the traditional first line of defense against a corporate takeover. \n \n The company announced on Monday that its board had adopted a shareholder rights plan, or poison pill, just days after Mr. Icahn disclosed he had acquired a 9.98 percent stake. \n \n Netflix said the plan was meant to protect the company and shareholders from \u201cefforts to obtain control of Netflix that the board of directors determines are not in the best interests of Netflix and its stockholders.\u201d \n \n In a statement on Monday, Icahn Capital said that \u201cany poison pill without a shareholder vote is an example of poor corporate governance, and find the pill Netflix just adopted is particularly troubling due to its remarkably low and discriminatory 10 percent threshold.\u201d \n \n \u201cAs one of the company\u2019s largest shareholders we are concerned about the poor corporate governance at Netflix that these and other actions reflect,\u201d the statement added. \n \n The poison pill is intended to make it more expensive for Mr. Icahn to accumulate more Netflix shares. \n \n Under the plan, the company is issuing one right for every common share. Each right enables a shareholder to buy one one-thousandth of a new preferred share at the exercise price of $350 per right. But these rights can be exercised only if an investor acquires 10 percent of the company without the approval of the company\u2019s board. (Institutional investors can acquire up to 20 percent.) \n \n In its statement, Netflix added: \n \n In addition, if after a person or group acquires 10 percent (or 20 percent in the case of 13G institutional investors) or more of Netflix\u2019s outstanding common stock, Netflix merges into another company, an acquiring entity merges into Netflix or Netflix sells or transfers more than 50 percent of its assets, cash flow or earning power, then each right will entitle the holder thereof to purchase, for the exercise price, a number of shares of common stock of the person engaging in the transaction having a then-current market value of twice the exercise price. The acquiring person will not be entitled to exercise these rights. \n \n The rights plan will expire on Nov. 2, 2015. ||||| Netflix Inc. said Monday its board adopted an antitakeover plan intended to block activist investor Carl Icahn from expanding his nearly 10% stake in the streaming video and DVD-by-mail company. \n \n Video From the Archive \n \n Netflix shot up in the market when billionaire investor Carl Icahn purchased 10% of the company's shares on Wednesday, Oct. 31.

The company said its board members weren't available for comment. \n \n In a securities filing Monday, Mr. Icahn called Netflix's poison pill \"an example of poor corporate governance\" because the company didn't seek a shareholder vote. He also called on Netflix to allow for its full slate of directors to stand for election each year, rather than the staggered system it has today where only a portion of the board stands for election in a given year. Mr. Icahn didn't return requests for further comment. \n \n \"Our board continuously reviews our governance structure,\" said the Netflix spokesman. \"Its goal is to maximize long-term value for shareholders.\" \n \n Mr. Icahn on Oct. 31 disclosed he had acquired a 9.98% stake \u2013 roughly 1% directly and the rest in options\u2014calling the company's shares \"undervalued.\" In an interview with The Wall Street Journal at the time, he suggested he might seek buyers for the Los Gatos, Calif.-based company. \n \n Investors welcomed Mr. Icahn's move, sending Netflix's shares up 14% last Wednesday. Netflix had lost nearly three-quarters of its value following several missteps last year, including a jacked-up price for its subscribers in July 2011 and an ill-fated plan to split the company's DVD-by-mail rental business from its Internet video-streaming business. \n \n Enlarge Image Close Annie Tritt for The Wall Street Journal Netflix CEO Reed Hastings \n \n Netflix lost roughly a million of its customers following the announcements and said last month it was behind schedule toward a previous goal of boosting its subscriber base by seven million U.S. streaming-video subscribers this year. \n \n \"If Icahn has a great deal of support from other shareholders, he may press ahead for policy changes or board members of his choosing,\" said Charles Elson, director of the John L.

    "document": "Egypt has been hit by another wave of major violence ahead of parliamentary elections after security forces opened fire on thousands of protesters demonstrating against the military junta. \n \n Two people were reported dead and more than 600 injured in central Cairo after riot police sent volleys of tear gas, rubber bullets and \"birdshot\" pellet cartridges into the crowds. The clashes put further pressure on the ruling generals and cast doubt on the ability of police to secure the poll, scheduled to begin on 28 November. \n \n \"All options are on the table, but right now \u2013 given the state Egypt is in \u2013 nobody can see how the military council can pull off these elections,\" said Mahmoud Salem, a prominent blogger who is running for parliament but who has now frozen his campaign. \"I'm at the international eye hospital at the moment with my friend Malek Mustafa, who has been shot in the head by police with a pellet cartridge and looks likely to lose his eye. How can I continue?\" \n \n Mustafa was one of dozens of demonstrators left with serious head wounds during the police assault on Tahrir Square. Trouble began after riot police moved to disperse tents set up after a large rally calling on Egypt's Supreme Council of Armed Forces (Scaf) to return the country to civilian rule. \n \n Protesters succeeded in driving the security forces from the square and captured one of their trucks. Crowds jumped up and down on the vehicle, chanting \"The interior ministry are thugs\" and calling for the downfall of Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, the country's de facto leader since the toppling of Hosni Mubarak in February. It was later set ablaze. \n \n By mid-afternoon police had returned to Tahrir in far larger numbers and began firing from armoured vehicles. Pro-change activists sent out calls for solidarity and as darkness fell police and the protesters saw their ranks swell. As the night wore on and control of Tahrir shifted back and forth between the security forces and demonstrators, running battles spilled down side streets and along several of downtown Cairo's most important thoroughfares. \n \n The Observer saw heavy fighting along Talaat Harb street, a key shopping district and one of the main roads running into Tahrir Square. Street lighting was cut and amid the gloom hundreds of protesters tore up paving stones to throw at police lines, sporadically falling back as clouds of tear gas filled the air. \n \n \"The scenes are reminiscent of the Friday of Anger,\" said journalist and pro-change activist Hossam el-Hamalawy, referring to 28 January, the day protesters beat Mubarak's security forces off the streets during the uprising against his regime. \"We are being hit with showers of US-made tear gas canisters, and I've watched with my own eyes at least five people being struck by rubber bullets.\" \n \n A military police car which at one point approached the centre of the unrest was chased away by protesters, another sign of public support for the junta apparently waning. \"Ordinary people are making a stronger link than ever between Scaf and the hated troops of the interior ministry,\" added el-Hamalawy. \"The police and Scaf are revealing their true colours with this brutal attack on Egyptians. They have succeeded in only one thing today, and that is mobilising even more of Egyptian society against them.\" \n \n By late evening the number of demonstrators had grown to several thousand with the arrival of the ultras \u2013 hardcore fans of Cairo's main football teams, some of whom played a significant role in the anti-regime uprising earlier this year \u2013 and some Islamist political groups, forcing police units to fall back from Tahrir where protesters quickly built barricades and fires continued to burn. \n \n The retreat marked a significant blow to the security forces, which over the past few months have generally avoided attacking large protests, preferring to wait instead until numbers dwindle and the remaining activists can be isolated and labelled as hardcore troublemakers. On Saturday that tactic appeared to have backfired, with the police assault provoking a strong public response. \n \n \"Considering the small numbers that we had this morning, it's amazing,\" said Hady Kamar, a 26 year old artist who was hit twice by rubber bullets, once in the foot and once in the head. \"When things looked darkest and the police had pushed us out of Tahrir, we returned in huge numbers. To see this many on the street and feel this much energy, is special. Today it feels like the revolution is back up and running, but we'll see what tomorrow brings. It's always been a day by day struggle.\" \n \n Reprising many of the slogans used during mass protests against Mubarak, demonstrators vented their anger at Scaf and chanted 'Here is the revolution, nothing else'. \n \n Many expressed scepticism about the elections, saying they were designed to entrench military control over the country, but most insisted they still wanted the vote to go ahead. \"The generals want to rule Egypt, but this is our revolution,\" said Ahmed Mohamed, a 24-year-old accountant. \"Look around you \u2013 you don't see different political parties or rival candidates, you just see the Egyptian people. People have come down from their homes to join the fight; we are battling the remnants of Mubarak's regime who remain in power at the moment, and both this and the elections are all part of that same process.\" \n \n Solidarity rallies also erupted in the large cities of Alexandria and Suez. Egypt's interior ministry claimed its forces had acted with restraint, and blamed protesters for escalating tensions so close the parliamentary vote. \n \n On Friday a group of prominent intellectuals, including former UN nuclear weapons chief Mohamed ElBaradei, unveiled an alternative transition plan which would involve postponing the parliamentary ballot and wresting executive control of Egypt away from the armed forces whilst a new constitution is drawn up. \n \n The ruling generals have yet to respond to the proposal. ||||| 1 of 6. Egyptian riot police clash with protesters at Tahrir Square in Cairo November 19, 2011. \n \n CAIRO (Reuters) - At least one person was killed and more than 650 wounded in clashes between riot police and protesters in Cairo's Tahrir square on Saturday, official said, after a protest demanding the ruling military transfer power swiftly to a civilian government. \n \n Protests also erupted in other cities, including Alexandria and Suez, witnesses said. \n \n Egypt holds its first parliamentary election, from November 28, since president Hosni Mubarak was toppled in a popular uprising in February and parties and the ruling military are jostling for position. \n \n Police pulled down the tents of about 100 protesters who had camped in the square overnight after a demonstration on Friday of about 50,000 people, mostly Islamists, against the military leadership. \n \n That prompted around 5,000 protesters to return to the square and clashes erupted. Police fired rubber bullets and buildings and two cars in the square were set on fire, witnesses said. A third vehicle, close to the Arab League's headquarters, was also on fire. \n \n \"The people want to topple the regime!\" hundreds of youths chanted as they rushed toward a line of police. \n \n State news agency MENA cited the health ministry's spokesman as saying 676 people had been hurt and Ahmed Mahmoud, a 23-year-old demonstrator, died in hospital after being shot. \n \n Riot police, who used tear gas to clear the area in the early evening, later fired more tear gas at protesters who had regained control of the square, witnesses said. Police beat protesters with batons while protesters broke off chunks of cement from sidewalks to throw at the police. \n \n \"We are fighting them non-stop,\" shouted one protester. \n \n Egyptian state television said Prime Minister Essam Sharaf called on protesters in Tahrir to clear the square. \n \n The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party said it \"denounced the break-up of the Tahrir sit-in by force. (This is) reminiscent of the practices of the defunct regime's Interior Ministry.\" \n \n The April 6th Youth Movement said it opposed the use of force against peaceful protesters and demanded the interior minister quit. \n \n The demonstrators denounced Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, the head of Egypt's ruling military council, while some criticised the Muslim Brotherhood, whom they accused of working to further their own political ends. \n \n \"We are not political parties and we hate the Brotherhood who gave up on the revolution and the people,\" Medhat Fawzy said. \"We are Egyptian youth,\" he added, flashing victory signs and chanting \"down down Tantawi.\" \n \n In the northern port city of Alexandria demonstrators chanted against the military council: \"This is their understanding of change, they beat our brothers in Tahrir!\" \n \n In the eastern city of Suez, protesters tore down banners of members of Mubarak's disbanded National Democratic Party who are running in the election. \n \n \"TROUBLEMAKERS\" \n \n State television said 40 of the wounded were police officers and said \"18 troublemakers\" had been arrested. \n \n Friday's rally appeared to be the biggest Islamist challenge to military rule since the largely secular uprising that toppled Mubarak. The demonstration was mostly comprised of Brotherhood members and their harder-line Salafi rivals. \n \n Protesters expressed anger at a draft constitution that Deputy Prime Minister Ali al-Silmi showed to political groups earlier this month which would give the army exclusive authority over its internal affairs and budget. \n \n The election could be disrupted if parties and the government fail to resolve the row over the draft constitution that had denied parliamentary oversight of the army, potentially allowing it to defy an elected government. \n \n As clashes raged in Tahrir square, al-Silmi and the Brotherhood appeared to be negotiating, through press statements and the state news agency, on percentages of members of parliament (MPs) needed to approve the assembly that will write the constitution. \n \n MENA reported that al-Silmi had amended some clauses of the constitutional proposal, including one to say Egypt is a \"democratic state\" instead of \"democratic civil state,\" a move likely to anger liberals who fear that a parliamentary majority could seek to turn Egypt into an Islamic state. \n \n Al-Silmi said the committee chosen to write the constitution would not be confined to the larger groups in parliament to ensure \"a constitution that reflects national consensus and receives the consent of all segments of society.\" \n \n Political analyst Ezzedine Fishere said he did not expect the amendments to appease Islamist groups. \n \n \"(Islamists) see that they will get a majority in parliament and hence want total freedom in choosing the constitutional committee and writing the constitution,\" he said. \n \n Analysts say Islamists could win 40 percent of parliament seats, with a big portion going to the Brotherhood. \n \n \"What is happening now is a showdown between the two factions ... an on-the-ground confrontation with each party trying to enforce its will, the military council from one end and the Islamist currents from the other,\" Fishere said. \n \n MENA reported that al-Silmi had amended the constitutional proposal to say members of the constituent assembly writing the constitution would be chosen by a \"majority\" of elected MPs instead of his earlier announcement that they would be chosen by a \"two-thirds majority.\" \n \n (Reporting by Shaimaa Fayed, Marwa Awad, Omar Fahmy, Patrick Werr, Tamim Elyan and Abdel Rahman Youssef; Editing by Janet Lawrence)",

Tom Goralski said a 36-year-old man punched Bieniewicz in the head after the referee indicated he planned to eject the man from the game. Baseel Abdul-Amir Saad of Dearborn was arraigned Monday on a charge of assault with intent to do great bodily harm. The Wayne County prosecutor's office said the charges would be reviewed and possibly amended when it had the necessary documentation. \n \n Bieniewicz, 44, was a dialysis technician at Mott Children's Hospital who lived in the Detroit suburb of Westland with his wife and two sons, said Acho, who was a classmate of Bieniewicz's at Catholic Central High School. \n \n \"I speak for all his friends when I say we are devastated. Crushed. Just a senseless way for a great guy to go out,\" Acho said. \"He deserved better.\" \n \n Bieniewicz, Acho said, was the only student-athlete in the class of 1988 to letter in both football and basketball at the ultra-competitive Detroit-area parochial school. Acho, who ran a basketball camp with Bieniewicz for four years after high school, said his 6-foot-5 friend would \"wow the kids with dunks.\" \n \n But much to the surprise of his friends, Bieniewicz gravitated to soccer. He had been a well-respected referee for two decades. \n \n Another friend, Anthony Arrington, said he would often seek Bieniewicz's advice when coaching his sons' youth soccer teams. \n \n \"We have a special bond,\" said Arrington, who added that Bieniewicz's passion for soccer spurred members of their group of friends to watch the World Cup in Brazil. \n \n \"Just heartbroken. Just a good person, good family man,\" Arrington said. \n \n Bieniewicz was doing what he loved on Sunday when he was attacked, Acho said. \n \n Saad was not at Mies Park when police arrived, but surrendered Monday, Goralski said. At Saad's arraignment in Livonia District Court, bond was set at $500,000 and a probable-cause hearing was set for July 10. \n \n Saad's lawyer, Brian Berry, said his client was cooperating with police and was not guilty of the charge. \n \n \"As the case progresses we expect to learn the cause of the referee's injuries,\" Berry said. \n \n Acho said a fund was being set up to help pay for his friend's funeral and burial expenses as well as his children's futures.

Mott Children\u2019s Hospital in Ann Arbor, described him as family man and a huge fan of the University of Michigan who was always in a good mood. \n \n \u201cHe\u2019s a fantastic human being,\u201d Acho said. \u201cA guy who lives life to the fullest.\u201d \n \n \u25a0 Audio: Listen to the 911 call \n \n Witnesses told the Free Press that Bieniewicz was punched when he was about to eject a player, who had been complaining about a call made during the match in Livonia, resulting in a second violation to be issued against him. Several people playing on the opposing team of Bassel Abdul-Amir Saad, the man accused of throwing the punch, said Bieniewicz was looking down, trying to get a violation card when it happened. \n \n \u201cJohn had no idea it was coming,\u201d said Matt Tunstall, 41, of Ann Arbor, who said he was about 10-15 yards away, waiting to come into the game. \n \n He hit the ground at Mies Park, and stunned players ran onto field and noticed he wasn\u2019t breathing. \n \n \u201cHe turned blue immediately,\u201d said Daniel Winkler, 33, of Lathrup Village. \u201cMy wife called 911.\u201d \n \n Witnesses said Bieniewicz did nothing to provoke the attack and officiated neutrally. They called what happened \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cunfathomable.\u201d The match was being played by men ages 30 and older. \n \n Saad fled, and some players got the license plate number and a description of the vehicle to give to police, players said. \n \n Meanwhile, Dr. Jamal Saleh, a player in the game, performed CPR on the victim until EMS arrived, he said in a comment on freep.com. \n \n \u201cWe are all shocked and deeply saddened by these events,\u201d he wrote. \n \n 'We must keep open minds' \n \n Saad of Dearborn was arraigned Monday on a felony charge of assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder and received a $500,000 cash/surety bond. \n \n \u201cThe charges will be reviewed and amended when appropriate confirmations are made and other necessary documentation is received,\u201d said Maria Miller, a spokeswoman with the Wayne County Prosecutor\u2019s Office. \n \n Saad\u2019s attorney, Brian Berry, said his client cooperated with the police investigation and voluntarily turned himself in. \n \n \u201cOur hearts are saddened to learn of the passing of John Bieniewicz. May God bless him and his family members as they deal with this loss,\u201d Berry said in an e-mail to the Free Press. \n \n \u201cBased on certain witness statements that have not yet been published, it is believed that the facts of this case have been mischaracterized,\u201d the e-mail said. \u201cMr. Saad is presumed innocent unless and until a fact finder determines differently. As tragic as this event is, we must keep open minds and listen and wait for all the facts of this case to unfold.\u201d \n \n A preliminary examination is set for July 10 in 16th District Court in Livonia, authorities said. \n \n Friends, others help \n \n Bieniewicz, who never regained consciousness after being hit, was licensed to referee professional, collegiate, high school and recreation league soccer and often worked up to three matches on a Saturday, friends said. \n \n A memorial site has been created at JohnBieniewiczMemorial.com, which links to a GoFundMe site established to help with funeral and burial expenses and to also help his children, ages 9 and 13, moving forward. As of this evening, more than $17,000 had been raised. \n \n \u201cOne senseless act in the blink of an eye has affected so many,\u201d Acho said. \n \n Assault death wouldn't be first \n \n Bieniewicz was refereeing a match in the Michigan United Soccer League on Sunday between the Metro Rangers and the Bintjbeil Stars, players said. An official with the league did not return messages left Tuesday. \n \n While rare, it\u2019s not the first time a referee has died after being assaulted. In 2013 in Utah, a 17-year-old was accused of punching Ricardo Portillo in the head because he didn\u2019t like the referee\u2019s call during a game. Portillo died, leaving behind three daughters, and the teen pleaded guilty to a charge of homicide by assault in juvenile court. \n \n Metro Detroit players, many who have been playing soccer for decades, say they\u2019ve never seen anything close to what happened in Livonia on Sunday. \n \n \u201cI\u2019ve never ever, ever seen any act like this in any capacity,\u201d said Tunstall, who has played the game for 36 years. \n \n He has seen some players get heated and come chest to chest with a referee or even poke one, or players grab each other when they are upset, but never punch a person. \n \n \u201cAt the end of the day, we have families, we have jobs, we really do it for the love of the game,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery minute it just replays over in my head. It\u2019s just a shock and just so disappointing and sad.\u201d ||||| CHARGED. REPORTING FROM ROSEVILLE, I'M PRIYA MANN, LOCAL 4.

WE'LL TALK TO DR. McGEORGE HOW ONE PUNCH CAN BE SO DEADLY. Carmen: BUT FIRST, LET'S GO TO ROGER WEBER WITH HOW HIS FELLOW REFEREES AND COMMUNITY ARE REMEMBERING HIM TONIGHT. Roger: JOHN BIENIEWICZ WAS GREATLY RESPECTED IN THE SOCCER COMMUNITY. FELLOW REFEREES ARE TAKING THIS SENSELESS TRAGEDY VERY HARD. JOHN BIENIEWICZ MADE A STRONG POSITIVE IMPRESSION IN THE SOCCER COMMUNITY, ESPECIALLY AT HIGH VELOCITY SPORTS IN CANTON AND REFEREED HERE DURING THE WINTER MONTHS DURING THE LAST 8 YEARS. HE WOULD COME TOERL TALK SOCCER. Roger: HE WOULD REFEREE UP TO FIVE GAMES A DAY, WHICH IS LIKE RUNNING A MARATHON. HE WAS ASSIGNED TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL GAMES AND HE SOMETIMES REFEREED WITH HIM. JOHN HAD GREAT CHARACTER AND HE WAS A PHENOMENAL REFEREE, AN EXCELLENT REFEREE. Roger: ON SUNDAY, HE WAS ABOUT TO PULL A RED CARD FROM HIS POCKET, EJECTING A PLAYER, WHO THEN SUCKER PUNCHED HIM. THE HUSBAND AND FATHER OF TWO DIED TODAY. POLICE HAVE CHARGED 36-YEAR-OLD BASEEL SAAD. AND IT'S REALLY, REALLY HARD BECAUSE NOT ONLY DID I LOSE A GREAT REFEREE, BUT I LOST A GREAT FRIEND. Roger: 10,000 TO 15,000 PEOPLE REFEREE SOCCER GAMES IN MICHIGAN AND HE HOPES THAT PEOPLE WILL REMEMBER THEY'RE DOING A DIFFICULT JOB AS BEST THEY CAN. THEY HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, IT'S JUST A GAME! IT'S JUST A GAME! IT'S REALLY NOT NECESSARY TO DISAGREE WITH THE REFEREE. TAKE THE CALL ON MOVE ON. Roger: ASSAULT CHARGES AGAINST THE DEFENDANT ARE GOING TO BE UPGRADED NOW THAT JOHN HAS DIED. A MEMORIAL FUND HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED TO HELP HIS FAMILY. YOU CAN GET MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT ON CLICKONDETROIT.COM. REPORTING LIVE FROM LIVONIA, ROGER WEBER, LOCAL 4. Devin: I KNOW A LOT OF REFEREES WORRY ABOUT THIS THING HAPPENING. HOW DO YOU PREVENT IT? Roger: SOME SUGGEST TOUGHER PENALTIES FOR PLAYERS WHO WOULD PHYSICALLY OR VERBALLY ABUSE REFEREES, BUT IN THIS CASE, NO ONE SAW THIS KIND OF PUNCH COMING. BUT THEY DON'T WANT FANS AND PLAYERS TO FORGET ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO JOHN. THEY HOPE THEY WILL RECALL THIS AND JUST HOLD THEIR TEMPER. REMEMBER, IT'S A GAME AND SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT FUN AND FITNESS. Carmen: AND OFTENTIMES, IT HAPPENS SO QUICKLY, NOT A WHOLE LOT OF TIME THERE. THIS TRAGEDY HAS LEFT MANY WONDERING HOW IT'S POSSIBLE TO DIE FROM A SINGLE BLOW TO THE HEAD. DR. FRANK McGEORGE JOINS US TO EXPLAIN. IT CAN HAPPEN AS WE SAW. Dr. McGeorge: IT CAN HAPPEN. IT'S NOT COMMON FOR PEOPLE TO DIE FROM A SINGLE BLOW TO THE HEAD, BUT IT DOES HAPPEN. IT'S MORE LIKELY IN CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE THIS WHERE SOMEONE IS CAUGHT OFF GUARD BECAUSE THERE'S NO OPPORTUNITY TO REDUCE THE FORCE OF THE BLOW BY SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AND TURNING YOUR HEAD OR TENSING YOUR NECK MUSCLES, LIKE IN A CAR ACCIDENT. IF YOUR HEAD IS STRUCK AND THERE'S NO MUSCLE CONTROL, IT MOVES MUCH FASTER. THE BRAIN ACTUALLY HAS THE CONSISTENCY OF LIKE FIRM JELL-O. SO WHEN YOU'RE HIT, IT'S LIKE SHAKING JELL-O IN A JAR AND CAUSES SMALL TEARS IN THE BRAIN FROM THE RAPID DECELEBRATION AND ACCELERATION. IF THE PLEADING IS SEVERE, IT CAUSES DEATH QUICKLY. EVEN WHEN THERE'S NO BLEEDING, THE SWELLING OF THE BRAIN FROM THE GENERAL DAMAGE INCREASES THE PRESSURE IN THE SKULL WHICH CUTS OFF THE BLOOD FLOW. EVEN WITHOUT BREAKING THE SKULL, THE FORCE CAN KILL SOMEONE. AND THAT'S WHY THINGS LIKE THE KNOCKOUT GAME AND THINGS LIKE THAT ARE SO DANGEROUS. AND IT'S BEING CAUGHT OFF GUARD. Devin: THIS HAS HAPPENED -- IT HAPPENED LAST YEAR IN UTAH, A REFEREE DIED FROM BEING HIT. Dr. McGeorge: I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS ABOUT SOCCER. IT HAPPENED LAST YEAR IN A SOCCER GAME AND HAPPENED IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SPORTS. IT'S NOT COMMON. PEOPLE GET HIT ALL THE TIME IN FIGHTS, BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING ABOUT GETTING CAUGHT OFF GUARD BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT YOURSELF. Carmen: AND NOBODY WANTS TO GET A CARD.",

Major trade unions and landless peasant movements planned bigger, nationwide protests on Sunday, when the debate is set to culminate with a vote that Rousseff is widely expected to lose. \n \n The government lost a last-ditch appeal on Thursday before the Supreme Court to halt the impeachment process, which could bring further instability or even chaos to Latin America\u2019s largest economy after 13 years of rule by the leftist Workers\u2019 Party. \n \n Rousseff is accused of manipulating budget accounts in 2014 to secure her re-election. \n \n She has strongly rejected the accusation and planned to appeal to Brazilians in a televised speech on Friday night. But the increasingly isolated leader canceled the broadcast after an opposition party sought a court injunction to block it, arguing that she was unfairly using resources of the Brazilian state to defend herself. \n \n Rousseff is fighting to survive a political storm fueled by Brazil\u2019s worst recession since the Great Depression in the 1930s and a spiraling corruption scandal that has reached her inner circle. \n \n In a further blow for the president, Minister for Cities Gilberto Kassab resigned his post late on Friday, according to two sources familiar with matter. His Brazil Social Democratic Party (PSD) split from the government on Wednesday and said it would vote for Rousseff\u2019s impeachment. \n \n Police stepped up security in the Brazilian capital where a half-mile-long (1 km) metal fence has been erected on the grass esplanade opposite Congress to avoid clashes between rival demonstrators expected to turn out by the tens of thousands over the weekend. \n \n In Rio de Janeiro, police said they plan to form a cordon on the Copacabana beachfront avenue to separate the pro-impeachment crowd from Rousseff supporters. \n \n \u201cI am very worried that there will be violence, depending on the result of the vote and the number of people who gather in Brasilia,\u201d said Congressman Rogerio Rosso, who chaired the lower house committee that backed Rousseff\u2019s impeachment. \n \n The country\u2019s top network TV Globo plans to broadcast Sunday\u2019s critical roll-call vote from beginning to end, starting at 2 p.m. (1700 GMT), which analysts said will add pressure on lawmakers to vote for impeachment. \n \n Polls show that roughly two-thirds of Brazilians support impeachment. \n \n Jurist Miguel Reale Junior speaks during a session to review the request for Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff's impeachment at the Chamber of Deputies in Brasilia, Brazil April 15, 2016. REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino \n \n \u201cVIOLENT ACT\u201d \n \n As opposition congressmen called for Rousseff\u2019s ouster, Attorney General Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Cardozo addressed Congress in her defense, calling the impeachment process a \u201cviolent act with no parallel against democracy.\u201d \n \n \u201cHistory will never forgive those who broke with democracy,\u201d Cardozo said, as ruling lawmakers shouted: \u201cThere won\u2019t be a coup.\u201d \n \n While the budget violations alleged against Rousseff are serious, she has not been directly implicated in the kickback scandal engulfing state-run oil company Petrobras, though her opponents say that bribe money was used to fund her election campaigns. \n \n Slideshow (15 Images) \n \n The move to impeach her, after months of political deadlock, is widely seen as a vote of no-confidence in a leader blamed for turning once-booming Brazil into the worst performer among the world\u2019s major economies. \n \n Support for unseating Rousseff has gained momentum in recent weeks, with the defection of parties from her ruling coalition. \n \n Nineteen of the 25 parties with seats in the lower house now back impeachment, the Brasilia-based consultancy Arko Advice said on Friday. They will deliver at least 350 votes and maybe 370, exceeding the two-thirds majority in the 513-seat house needed to send impeachment to the Senate, it said. \n \n Former Justice Minister Miguel Reale Jr., a leading supporter of impeachment, opened Friday\u2019s debate by saying the process to oust Rousseff reflected the will of the people. \u201cShe was extremely irresponsible and knocked out the country,\u201d he said. \n \n If her impeachment is approved by the lower house, the Senate must then vote on whether to go ahead with putting Rousseff on trial for disobeying budget laws. \n \n If the Senate approved a trial, in a vote that would likely take place on May 11, Rousseff would automatically be suspended and replaced by Vice President Michel Temer. \n \n Temer, who would serve out Rousseff\u2019s term until 2018 if she is ousted by the Senate, has little popular support. He would face a daunting task restoring confidence in a country where dozens of political leaders, including his close associates, are under investigation for corruption. \n \n Temer is considering the chairman of Goldman Sachs in Brazil, Paulo Leme, and the founder of asset manager Maua Capital, Luiz Fernando Figueiredo, as candidates to join his economic team should he take over the presidency in coming weeks, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday. ||||| A majority of Brazil's Supreme Court have rejected a last-ditch attempt by President Dilma Rousseff to halt an impeachment process against her in advance of a vote in Congress. \n \n Justices denied a request on Thursday for an injunction against proceedings that Brazil's attorney general - the government lawyer - called \"Kafkaesque\" and said amounted to denying Rousseff the opportunity to defend herself. \n \n Brazil's lower house of Congress is due to vote on Sunday on sending Rousseff to trial in the Senate. \n \n The move could push Brazil from political paralysis into a chaotic power vacuum by ending the 13-year rule of Rousseff\u2019s Workers' Party. \n \n Earlier on Thursday, Jose Eduardo Cardozo, the attorney general, asked the top court for an injunction to suspend Sunday's lower house vote until the full court can rule on what he called procedural flaws in the impeachment process. \n \n Reporting from Brazil's capital Brasilia, Al Jazeera's Latin America Editor Lucia Newman said: \"The top court decided in a split vote. Two judges agreed with the attorney general that the president had been denied due process. \n \n \"Now nothing can stop the impeachment vote from taking place.\" \n \n The lower house began debating the charges against the president on Friday morning. \n \n \"The debate will go on for at least 48 hours. The voting will start on Sunday afternoon. That's prime time in Brazil,\" Newman said. \n \n Rousseff, already struggling with Brazil's worst economic crisis in decades and a historic corruption scandal, has lost support within her governing coalition. \n \n She faces the growing likelihood of defeat in the lower house vote, which would send her impeachment to the Senate for trial on charges of breaking budget laws. \n \n READ MORE: Poetry and poverty on the margins of Brazil \n \n If the Senate accepts her impeachment, Rousseff would be suspended and replaced by Vice President Michel Temer as soon as early May pending a trial that could last six months. \n \n \"The country's most popular entertainment show has been cancelled in order to broadcast the proceedings,\" Al Jazeera's Newsman said. \n \n \"By Sunday night, we should know whether or not the lower house has agreed to recommend the impeachment to the Senate, which will ultimately be in charge of the impeachment.\" \n \n Rousseff, a former leftist guerrilla, had not been expected to resort to the Supreme Court until after Sunday's vote. Cardozo's request to the court was seen as a sign that her government now expects defeat. \n \n Rousseff's opponents are just nine votes short of victory in the lower house, with 333 politicians backing impeachment, 124 opposed and 56 undecided or declining to respond, according to a survey by the Estado de S Paulo newspaper. \n \n Several of the top court justices recently said that they did not think the court should interfere with the legislature's jurisdiction in the impeachment battle. \n \n Brazil's largest political party, Rousseff's main coalition partner until it broke away two weeks ago, said most of its members in the lower house would back deposing her. \n \n Leonardo Picciani, the lower chamber leader for the party, the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, or PMDB, said 90 percent of the 68 members of his caucus would vote for impeachment.",

    "document": "Renamed the Parker Solar Probe to honour solar astrophysicist who predicted high speed solar wind, the spacecraft will attempt to get close to sun\u2019s surface \n \n Nasa has announced its hotly anticipated mission to send a spacecraft into the sun\u2019s outer atmosphere has a new name. \n \n Formerly known as the Solar Probe Plus mission, the endeavour will now be known as the Parker Solar Probe, honouring the American solar astrophysicist Eugene Parker who predicted a high speed solar wind \u2013 the stream of charged particles, or plasma, that flows from the sun out into space. \n \n Parker, a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago who will turn 90 on 10 June, put forward his theory in 1958. It was initially met with scepticism. \u201cPeople just thought it was crazy,\u201d said Justin Kasper, a space scientist at the University of Michigan and lead investigator for one of the probe\u2019s scientific research projects. But later observations proved the prediction correct. \n \n Esa\u2019s Solar Orbiter mission passes crucial milestone Read more \n \n Parker\u2019s work delved into a longstanding puzzle. While the temperature at the centre of the sun is about 15mC, further out things get complicated. \u201cOne of the mysterious things about our sun\u2019s atmosphere is the [sun\u2019s] surface, which is glowing visible in the yellow and white, is 6,000C, but the corona \u2013 its atmosphere \u2013 is at 1m-5mC,\u201d said Kasper. \n \n The incredible temperatures in the corona, Parker realised, would create an unstable situation, meaning the sun\u2019s atmosphere is no longer pulled back by the star\u2019s gravity but instead escapes into space. \n \n \u201cParker said that by a couple of solar radii, the atmosphere would hit the speed of sound, it would break the sound barrier in the sun\u2019s atmosphere, [and] by 10 solar radii it would be going supersonic,\u201d said Kasper. \u201cWe enter the space age, and one of the first things we discover is this supersonic solar wind.\u201d \n \n With the probe set to investigate the origins of solar wind, including the mysterious heating of the sun\u2019s atmosphere and how the solar wind accelerates to astonishing speeds of up to 400 miles per second, the renaming of the mission is a fitting tribute to Parker. \n \n It is not the first time that Nasa has renamed a mission to honour a scientist. In 2008 the space agency renamed the Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope as the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope in honour of the late Italian physicist Enrico Fermi. In 2012, the space agency announced that it was renaming the Radiation Belt Storm Probes in honour of the late James Van Allen. Van Allen discovered two radiation belts composed of charged particles, known as the Van Allen belts, that encircle the Earth. \n \n \u201cNasa has never named a spacecraft after a researcher during their lifetime. Well, ladies and gentlemen, we are about to make history,\u201d said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of the Nasa science mission directorate, announcing the new name of the mission at the University of Chicago. \n \n Speaking at the press conference Nicola Fox, mission project scientist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, added that a chip would be placed on board the spacecraft carrying pictures of Parker and his scientific papers, as well as a plate with an inscription of his choice. Parker was then presented with a model of the probe. \n \n In addition, Parker was awarded with the Nasa Distinguished Public Service Medal \u2013 the highest award from the space agency for non-governmental personnel \u2013 in honour of his lifetime\u2019s work. \n \n Dressed in a black suit and tie, Parker said that he was privileged that the mission had been named after him. \u201cI am greatly honoured to be associated with such a heroic scientific space mission,\u201d he said, explaining that designing a spacecraft to withstand temperatures so close to the sun is a considerable feat. \n \n \n \n Realising a dream from the beginning of the space age \n \n The size of a car, shaped like the business end of a torch, and built to withstand temperatures of more than 1400C (2552F), the newly named Parker Solar Probe is set to be launched next summer in an unprecedented attempted to get up close to our star, coming within 4m miles of its surface. \n \n \u201cIt is just extraordinary - it is something that people have wanted to do from the beginning of the space age,\u201d said Tim Horbury, professor of physics at Imperial College London. \n \n Scientist say the mission, costing in the region of $1.5bn, could radically change our understanding of the sun, while offering vital insights into space weather - phenomena including coronal mass ejections that trigger geomagnetic storms that not only damage satellite systems but can knock out power grids on Earth. \n \n \u201cIt is just a hugely important and scientifically fascinating mission,\u201d said David McComas, vice president of the Princeton University plasma physics laboratory and principal investigator for the probe\u2019s \u201cIntegrated Science Investigation of the sun\u201d, research that will probe how electrons, protons and other charged particles are accelerated in the sun\u2019s atmosphere. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest An artist\u2019s impression of the Parker Solar Probe spacecraft approaching the sun. Photograph: Johns Hopkins University Applied/PA \n \n \u201cIt is far closer than anything ever built by humanity has ever gotten to the sun,\u201d McComas said. \n \n Instruments for a number of scientific investigations on board the spacecraft will probe myriad solar phenomena from the electric and magnetic properties of the sun\u2019s plasma to counting and catching the components of solar wind. The latter, a project dubbed the Solar Wind Electrons Alphas and Protons Investigation, is led by Kasper. \n \n \u201cThe sun is obviously very hot \u2013 its outer atmosphere is at hundreds of thousands of degrees Kelvin, and as a result it blows a bubble into interstellar space,\u201d said Horbury. \u201cWe live in that bubble, we live in the heliosphere, and it is the solar wind that blows that bubble.\u201d \n \n The goal of the probe is to understand how the sun makes the solar wind, and explore the physical process that are occurring. A member of the science team for the probe\u2019s Fields instrument, Horbury plans to study turbulence within the solar wind. \n \n \u201cWhen we first started [looking at the sun from space] that we realised the sun is not a boring yellow sphere, it is an incredibly dynamic, active plasma object,\u201d he said. \n \n But the challenges have been immense, Horbury adds, describing the mission as \u201cjust on the edge of achievable\u201d. The major difficulty was designing the probe to prevent it being toasted by the sun\u2019s immense heat - as part of the solution the probe boasts a large heat-shield that is actively cooled by radiator systems. \n \n \u201cThere is a tiny spacecraft cowering behind this big heat shield,\u201d Horbury said. \u201cIt is just extreme - everything is different when you are that close in [to the sun].\u201d \n \n The Parker Solar Probe will travel far closer to the sun that any previous probe. While 4m miles might sound like a sizeable distance from the sun, it corresponds to under 10 solar radii. \u201c[The Earth is] about 250-odd solar radii away, so it is really close,\u201d said Horbury. \n \n The distance is crucial. Solar wind accelerates away from the sun, but it is about 10 solar radii that it effectively goes supersonic. \u201cThe point about the probe is it is going to get within that critical point,\u201d said Hornbury. \n \n McComas\u2019s part of the mission will explore in detail how certain particles, ejected by events including coronal mass ejections but not part of the solar wind, end up with very high energies, travelling at speeds of up to 80% of the speed of light. \u201cThey are really interesting and important particles because, for example, they can cause radiation damage in space to spacecraft, they can be a threat to astronauts in space,\u201d he said. \n \n \n \n The mission is not only expected to offer unprecedented insights into the physics of the sun \u2013 an endeavour that will shed light on processes happening in stars across the universe \u2013 but will also yield vital information about space weather, that could help scientists to predict major events before they affect Earth. \n \n The stakes for the mission are high, admits Horbury. \n \n \u201cThe thing about space is everyone has done the easy stuff \u2013 we are only left with the difficult things, so by definition this is risky,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are really pushing the limits of what is possible. But that is the way you make progress.\u201d ||||| NASA is naming its upcoming mission to \u201ctouch the Sun\u201d after Eugene Parker, a prominent astrophysicist who discovered the existence of solar wind \u2014 the charged particles that are constantly streaming from our star. The mission, originally named Solar Probe Plus, will now be called the Parker Solar Probe. It\u2019s the first time NASA has named one of its missions after a scientist who is still alive. Parker discovered solar wind in the 1950s and is about to celebrate his 90th birthday. \n \n The Parker Solar Probe is NASA\u2019s plan to send a spacecraft closer to our Sun than ever before. The probe, which is being developed by Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, is supposed to launch on top of a Delta IV Heavy rocket in either July or August of 2018 and then spend seven years getting into closer and closer orbits around the Sun. To do this, the vehicle will do seven flybys of Venus, which will eventually bring the spacecraft within 3.7 million miles of the Sun. That\u2019s about eight times closer than any other spacecraft has been before, according to NASA. \n \n NASA\u2019s plan to send a spacecraft closer to our Sun than ever before \n \n From this distance, the Parker Solar Probe will analyze the Sun\u2019s atmosphere, mainly to figure out the mechanics of the solar wind that Parker discovered. The Sun is constantly spewing out highly charged particles in the form of plasma \u2014 what is known as solar wind. And it\u2019s all thanks to the Sun\u2019s outer atmosphere, or the corona. Even though the corona extends millions of miles out into space, it is unbelievably hot \u2014 so hot that it heats up particles to such extreme temperatures that they break free of the Sun\u2019s gravity and accelerate outward in all directions. This solar wind, which carries part of the Sun\u2019s magnetic field, travels all the way to Earth and slams into our planet\u2019s own magnetic field. \n \n Fortunately, our field acts like a protective barrier, so usually this process is pretty harmless for us. But every now and then, the Sun burps out an extra helping of charged particles known as a coronal mass ejection. When this mess of particles reaches Earth, it can disturb our magnetic field enough to cause geomagnetic storms. These storms aren\u2019t too serious, but they can mess with our power grids and communications systems, as well as damage our satellites. \n \n We know the basics of how solar wind works, but the processes behind these particle bursts are still not totally understood. That\u2019s what the Parker Solar Probe is going to help us figure out. The spacecraft is designed to \u201ctrace the flow of energy\u201d that\u2019s responsible for heating up the corona and accelerating the solar wind. And the more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen. \n \n Normally, NASA waits to rename its missions after launch, but the space agency decided to break protocol this time since Parker\u2019s work has been so instrumental for the spacecraft\u2019s mission. His discovery of solar wind has essentially changed our understanding of stars and how they interact with the space around them. Apart from getting the mission named after him, a chip with pictures of Parker will also be included on the vehicles, as well as a copy of his original paper on solar wind. ||||| Below is the uncorrected machine-read text of this chapter, intended to provide our own search engines and external engines with highly rich, chapter-representative searchable text of each book.

A complete picture of the socioeconomic impact of severe space weather must include both direct, industry-specific effects (such as power outages and spacecraft anomalies) and the collateral effects of space-weather-driven technology failures on dependent infrastructures and services. Industry-Specific Space Weather Impacts The electric power, spacecraft, and aviation industries are the main industries whose opera- tions can be adversely affected by severe space weather. The effects of space weather can also be experienced by the growing number of users of the Global Positioning System (GPS) such as the oil and gas industry, which relies on GPS positioning data to support offshore drilling operations. Electric Power Industry During intense geomagnetic storms, the auroral oval moves to lower, more densely populated latitudes, where rapidly varying ionospheric currents associated with the aurora can produce direct-current flows in the electrical power grid. Such geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) can overload the grid, causing severe voltage regulation problems and, potentially, widespread power outages. Moreover, GICs can cause intense internal heating in extra-high-voltage (EHV) transformers, putting them at risk of failure or even permanent damage. The March 1989 Quebec blackout referred to above remains the classic example of the impact of a severe space weather event\u00e2\u0080\u0094the most intense storm of the space age1\u00e2\u0080\u0094on the electric power industry. Storm-related GICs caused a voltage depression in the Hydro-Qu\u00c3\u00a9bec grid that Hydro-Qu\u00c3\u00a9bec\u00e2\u0080\u0099s automatic voltage compensation equipment could not mitigate, resulting in a precipitous voltage collapse over a wide area. Specifically, five transmission lines from the James Bay hydroelectric power generation stations were tripped, causing a generation loss of 9,450 MW. With a load of about 21,350 MW, the system was unable to withstand the loss and collapsed within a minute and a half, blacking out the province of Quebec for approximately 9 hours. The effects of the storm were felt in the United States as well, in the Northeast, the upper-Midwest, the mid-Atlantic region, and even as far south as southern California. Approximately 200 storm- related events were reported to have affected power systems in North America; of these events the most severe was the failure of a large step-up transformer at the Salem Nuclear Power Plant in New Jersey. Other events ranged from generators tripping out of service, to voltage swings at major substations, to other, lesser equipment failures. Following the 1989 collapse of the Hydro-Qu\u00c3\u00a9bec grid, electric power companies developed operational procedures to protect power grids against disruption and damage by severe space weather. Grid operators receive space weather forecasts from the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and from commercial and other space weather services. They also monitor voltages and ground currents in real time. During the geomagnetic storms of October and November 2003, for example, power grid opera- \n \n EXTENDED SUMMARY tors in New England responded to severe space weather alerts and to real-time data from GIC monitors by modifying power grid operations in order to maintain adequate power quality for customers and reserve capacity to counteract the effects of the storms. Despite severe GICs, the power transmission equipment was protected, and the grid maintained continuous operation. Spacecraft Operations In late October 2003, powerful solar flares and fast Earthward-directed coronal mass ejections (CMEs) originating in an unusually large sunspot region (see p. 2) triggered especially intense geo- magnetic and radiation storms during which more than half the spacecraft anomalies reported for that year occurred (Figure 1). The impact of space weather on spacecraft systems is not limited to dramatic CME-driven space weather events such as the 2003 \u00e2\u0080\u009cHalloween\u00e2\u0080\u009d storms and the March 1989 storm. Of major concern to the spacecraft industry are the periodic enhancements of the magnetospheric energetic electron environment associated with high-speed solar wind streams emanating from coronal holes during the declining phase of the solar cycle as well the injection of energetic plasma into the inner magnetosphere during magnetic substorms, which can occur during nonstorm times as well as storm times. The effect of space weather on spacecraft operations is illustrated by the outage in January 1994 of two Canadian telecommunications satellites in geostationary orbit.2 On January 20, 1994, Telesat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Anik E1 was disabled for about 7 hours as a result of damage to its control electronics by the discharge of electric charge deposited in the interior of the spacecraft by penetrating high- energy electrons. The outage occurred during an energetic electron storm that had begun a week earlier as a high-speed solar wind stream swept past Earth. During the E1 outage, the Canadian press was unable to deliver news to 100 newspapers and 450 radio stations. In addition, tele- phone service to 40 communities was interrupted. Shortly after E1 was restored to service, its sister satellite, Anik E2, went off the air, resulting in the loss of television and data services to more than 1,600 remote communities. Backup systems were also damaged, making the $290 million satellite useless. Approximately 100,000 home satellite dish owners were required to re-point their dishes manually to E1 and other satellites. It took Telesat operators 6 months to restore Anik E2 to service. The E2 failure is estimated to have cost Telesat $50 million to $70 million (U.S. dollars) in recovery costs and lost business. The principal cause of space-weather-related spacecraft anomalies and failures is radiation in the form of solar energetic particles, galactic cosmic rays, and energetic particles trapped within Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s radiation belts or accelerated during magnetospheric substorms. In order to design spacecraft that can withstand the effects of continuous exposure to space radiation and operate 24/7 for 10 to 15 years, spacecraft designers need accurate long-term models of the radiation environment and information about the statistical distribution of extreme events (e.g., the space weather equivalent of the \u00e2\u0080\u009c100-year storm\u00e2\u0080\u009d). Designers are thus concerned primarily with space climatology rather than with specific space weather events. Spacecraft operators, however, require real-time knowledge of the space environment as well as short-term forecasts (\u00e2\u0080\u009cnowcasts\u00e2\u0080\u009d) in order to make operational decisions (e.g., with respect to thruster firing to reposition a spacecraft) that can reduce risks to spacecraft during disturbed conditions. (Such information is also used to support launch go/no-go decisions.) In the event of a spacecraft anomaly, knowledge of the \n \n EXTENDED SUMMARY 70 Average # of events/yr = 24.3 Average # of failures/yr = 2.5 60 Most events/failures are not attributed to space weather, but 46 of 70 in 2003 occurred during Halloween storms 50 Number of Reports 40 30 Ave Events 20 Events SC Failures 10 Ave Failures 0 1993* 1994* 1995* 1996* 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Figure 1. Telecommunication satellite anomalies and failures over a 14-year period. (Data for the years 1993-1996 2.9 Bodeau.eps are less extensive than for the period from 1997 on). The annual probability of an anomaly is around 10 percent, and the annual probability of a failure is about 1 percent. The big spike in 2003 reflects the anomalies that oc- curred during the October-November 2003 \u00e2\u0080\u009cHalloween\u00e2\u0080\u009d storms, which did not produce a significant rise in satellite failures. Around 250 commercial telecommunications satellites are operating in geosynchronous orbit. At a cost of roughly $300 million each, this fleet represents a $75 billion investment and generates an estimated annual revenue stream of more than $250 billion ($100 million per satellite per year). (Image courtesy of Michael Bodeau, Northrop Grumman.) environment where the anomaly occurred as well as climatological information helps operators determine whether or not the anomaly was caused by space weather. Airline Operations In the late 1990s, airline companies began to fly polar routes between North America and Asia in order to avoid strong wintertime headwinds and thus to reduce travel time (Figure 2). Decreased travel time makes it possible to carry less fuel, thus saving costs, and allows the air- lines to transport more passengers and cargo, increasing revenues. Because of the clear economic benefits, the use of polar routes has grown dramatically over the last decade. In 2007, thirteen carriers flew polar routes for a combined total of almost 7300 polar flights, an increase of nearly 2000 flights from the prior year. The transpolar routes take aircraft to latitudes where satellite communication cannot be used, and flight crews must rely instead on high-frequency (HF) radio to maintain communication \n \n EXTENDED SUMMARY WASHINGTON 82 N CHICAGO ABERI DEVID RAMEL NIKIN ORVIT BEIJING SHANGHAI HONG KONG Figure 2. Routes flown by transpolar flights between North America and Asia. Originally designated Polar 1, 2, 3, and 4, the routes were re-named after the waypoints ABERI, DEVID, RAMEL, and ORVIT. A fifth route, NIKIN 5.1 Stills.eps (shown in red), was added in 2007. At latitudes above 82\u00c2\u00b0 (yellow & typeflight crews cannot use satellite commu- bitmap w vector rules circle), nications and must rely instead on high-frequency (HF) radio to remain in contact with air traffic control. Changes in the polar ionosphere caused by solar energetic particle precipitation can degrade or totally black out HF radio communication. Transpolar flights must therefore be re-routed during intense solar radiation storms (solar energetic particle events). Timely space weather forecasts are important both for short-term (3-4 hour) operational planning and for longer-term (1 day) infrastructure planning (e.g., regarding air crew and aircraft assignments). (Image cour- tesy of Michael Stills, United Airlines.) with the airline company and air traffic control, as required by federal regulation. During certain severe space weather events (referred to by the SWPC as \u00e2\u0080\u009csolar radiation storms\u00e2\u0080\u009d), solar energetic particles\u00e2\u0080\u0094primarily protons accelerated by CME-driven shocks\u00e2\u0080\u0094spiral down geomagnetic field lines into the polar ionosphere, where they increase the density of the ionized gas, which in turn affects the ability of the radio waves to propagate and can result in a complete radio blackout. Such polar cap absorption (PCA) events can last for several days, during which time aircraft must be diverted to latitudes where satellite communication links can be used. During several days of \n \n EXTENDED SUMMARY disturbed space weather in January 2005, for example, 26 United Airlines flights were diverted to nonpolar or less-than-optimum polar routes to avoid the risk of HF radio blackouts during PCA events. The increased flight time and extra landings and take-offs required by such route changes increased fuel consumption and raised cost, while the delays disrupted connections to other flights. Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing The 24 Global Positioning System satellites operated by the United States Air Force provide accurate positioning and timing information to a variety of military, government, and civilian users. In addition, \u00e2\u0080\u009caugmentations\u00e2\u0080\u009d by both commercial services and government agencies improve the accuracy, integrity, and availability of GPS data. For example, as part of the transi- tion to space-based navigation as the primary means of navigation used by the National Airspace System, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has implemented the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), which provides precision horizontal and vertical navigation service over the continental United States, Alaska, and most of Canada and Mexico. WAAS effectively increases the capacity of the aviation system by allowing for reduced horizontal and vertical separation standards between planes without additional risk and by providing highly accurate vertical posi- tioning that enables precision approaches and landings. Current GPS-based navigation and positioning systems are vulnerable to space weather\u00e2\u0080\u0094 specifically, to ionospheric density irregularities that affect the propagation of the signals from the GPS satellites to the receivers on the ground. Such irregularities are a routine occurrence near the equator; during magnetic storms, however, they occur in the midlatitude ionosphere as well. Degradation of the GPS signal by ionospheric irregularities produces ranging errors and can result in the temporary loss of GPS reception. Solar radio bursts have recently been found to be an additional source of interference with GPS reception in Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sunlit hemisphere. Systems that use single-frequency receivers without augmentation are vulnerable even to minor ionospheric disturbances. Augmented systems are less susceptible to disruption by minor and moderate ionospheric disturbances but still can be adversely affected by scintillation, solar radio bursts, and major ionospheric disturbances. Thus, when WAAS detects ionospheric distur- bances, it disables the use of precision navigation in the affected areas so that safety is never compromised. When large areas of disturbance are detected, precision navigation is disabled for all areas until 8 hours after disturbances cease. During the October 2003 magnetic storms, for example, WAAS vertical navigation service was disabled for approximately 30 hours, although horizontal navigation guidance was continuously available (Figures 3 and 4). To mitigate the effects of space weather on the GPS, new signals and codes are being imple- mented that will allow GPS receivers to remove ionospheric ranging errors. This capability is expected to make augmentation systems unnecessary. In addition, the new signals and codes will be more resistant to fades caused by scintillation or solar radio bursts. The implementation of the new codes and signals, including the L5 signal dedicated to aviation, will take place incre- mentally over the next decade. \n \n EXTENDED SUMMARY Figure 3.

In addition to its use in aviation, GPS positioning and timing information is widely used in a number of other applications, including precision farming, surveying and mapping, marine navigation, offshore drilling rig positioning, and transportation. Future Vulnerabilities: The Specter of Extreme Space Weather Past With increasing awareness and understanding of space weather and its effects on modern technological systems, vulnerable industries have adopted procedures and technologies designed to mitigate the impacts of space weather on their operations and customers. As noted above, airlines re-route flights scheduled for polar routes during intense solar energetic particle events in order to preserve reliable communications. Alerted to an impending geomagnetic storm and monitoring ground currents in real-time, power grid operators take defensive measures to protect the grid against GICs. Similarly, under adverse space weather conditions, launch personnel may \n \n 10 EXTENDED SUMMARY Figure 4.

(Image adapted from material supplied by Leo Eldredge, Federal Avia- tion Adminstration.) delay a launch, and satellite operators may postpone certain operations. For the spacecraft indus- try, however, the primary approach to mitigating space weather effects remains designing satellites to operate under extreme environmental conditions to the maximum extent possible within cost and resource constraints. GPS modernization through the addition of the new navigation signals and new codes will help mitigate space weather effects, although to what degree is not known. The FAA will therefore maintain \u00e2\u0080\u009clegacy\u00e2\u0080\u009d non-GPS-based navigation systems as a backup. Our understanding of the vulnerabilities of modern technologies to severe space weather and the protective measures that have been developed are based largely on lessons learned during the past 20 or 30 years, during such episodes of severe space weather as the geomagnetic storms of March 1989 and October-November 2003. As severe as these recent events have been, the historical record reveals that space weather of even greater severity has occurred in the past (e.g., the \u00e2\u0080\u009cCarrington Event\u00e2\u0080\u009d of 1859 and the great magnetic storm of May 1921) and suggests that such extreme events, although rare, are likely to occur again some time in the future (see \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Great Magnetic Storms of August-September 1859,\u00e2\u0080\u009d pp. 14-15). \n \n EXTENDED SUMMARY 11 It is not known how a severe space weather event far more intense than any experienced during the space age might impact our modern technological systems. Of particular concern is the degree to which the electric power grid, which lies at the heart of our national infrastructure, might be affected by such an event. A study by the Metatech Corporation suggests that, despite the protective procedures developed since the Hydro-Qu\u00c3\u00a9bec collapse, an unusually powerful magnetic storm could result in widespread outages and possible long-term damage to the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s power grid. The Metatech study uses the great magnetic storm of May 1921 (\u00e2\u0080\u009cone of the great- est storms of the past ~130 years\u00e2\u0080\u009d3) to estimate the impact of an extreme space weather event on today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s electric power grid. Using the rate of change in Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s magnetic field measured in nanoteslas (nT) per minute as a proxy for GIC intensity, Metatech estimates that GICs during the 1921 storm would have been ten times more intense than those responsible for the March 1989 event. A storm of this magnitude today could result in large-scale blackouts affecting more than 130 million people (Figure 5). Moreover, according to the Metatech analysis, the intense GIC flows produced by the storm would place more than 300 large extra-high-voltage transformers at risk of failure or permanent damage, likely requiring a prolonged recovery period with long-term shortages of electric power to the affected areas (Figure 6). Collateral Impacts of Severe Space Weather An assessment of the societal and economic impacts of severe space weather must look beyond such direct space weather effects as spacecraft anomalies and power grid outages and consider how disruptions of vulnerable technological systems can affect the various sectors of society that are dependent on the functioning of these systems. Given the state of technology in the mid-19th century, the societal and economic impacts of the 1859 Carrington Event were limited to the disruptions of telegraph service \u00e2\u0080\u009cat the busy season when the telegraph is more than usually required,\u00e2\u0080\u009d4 the telegraph companies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 associated loss of income, and whatever the attendant effects on commerce might have been. Should an event of the magnitude of the Car- rington Event occur today, the story could be quite different because of the central role that technology\u00e2\u0080\u0094in particular, electric power\u00e2\u0080\u0094plays in our society and because of the dependencies and interdependencies that characterize our critical infrastructures, rendering them vulnerable to failures cascading from one system to another. Some of the indirect or collateral effects of a severe space weather event are vividly described in the following account of the 1989 Hydro-Qu\u00c3\u00a9bec blackout as it was experienced by the citi- zens of Montreal. The blackout closed schools and businesses, kept the Montreal Metro shut down during the morning rush hour, and paralyzed Dorval Airport, delaying flights. Without their navigation radar, no flight could land or take off until power had been restored. People ate their cold breakfast in the dark and left for work. They soon found themselves stuck in traffic that attempted to navigate darkened intersections without any streetlights or traffic control systems operating. . . . All these buildings [in downtown Montreal] were now pitch dark, stranding workers in offices, stairwells, and elevators. By some accounts, the blackout cost businesses tens of millions of dollars as it stalled production, idled workers, and spoiled products.5 \n \n 12 EXTENDED SUMMARY Figure 5.

The severity of the impacts depends on a number of variables, including the duration of the outage. The socioeconomic impacts of a long-term outage, requiring replacement of permanently dam- aged transformers, could be extensive and serious. According to an estimate by the Metatech Corporation, the total cost of a long-term, wide-area blackout caused by an extreme space weather event could be as much as $1 trillion to $2 trillion during the first year, with full recovery requir- ing 4 to 10 years depending on the extent of the damage. (For comparison, the total cost for the United States of the August 2003 blackout\u00e2\u0080\u0094a major non-space-weather-related blackout that affected 50 million people in the northeastern United States and Ontario\u00e2\u0080\u0094is estimated to have been between $4 billion and $10 billion.6) Figure 7.

Perkins, a respected physician in Newburyport, Massachusetts, observed \u00e2\u0080\u009ca perfect dome of alternate red and green streamers\u00e2\u0080\u009d over New England. To the citizens of Havana, Cuba, the sky that night \u00e2\u0080\u009cappeared stained with blood and in a state of general confla- gration.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dramatic auroral displays had been seen five nights before as well, on the night of August 28/29, when (again in the words of Dr. Perkins) \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe whole celestial vault was glowing with streamers, crimson, yellow, and white, gathered into waving brilliant folds.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In New York City, thousands gathered on sidewalks and rooftops to watch \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe heavens . . . arrayed in a drapery more gorgeous than they have been for years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The aurora that New Yorkers witnessed that Sunday night, the New York Times assured its readers, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill be referred to hereafter among the events which occur but once or twice in a lifetime.\u00e2\u0080\u009d8 Low-latitude red auroras, such as those widely reported to have been observed during the Carrington Event, are a characteristic feature of major geomagnetic storms. The aurora shown here was photographed over Napa Valley, Cali- fornia, during the magnetic storm of November 5, 2001. (Image courtesy D. Obudzinski, \u00c2\u00a9 Dirk Obudzinski 2001, www. borealis2000.com.) \n \n EXTENDED SUMMARY 15 From August 28 through September 4, auroral displays of extraordinary brilliance were observed throughout North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, and were seen as far south as Hawaii, the Caribbean, and Central America in the Northern Hemisphere and in the Southern Hemisphere as far north as Santiago, Chile. Even after daybreak, when the aurora was no longer visible, its presence contin- ued to be felt through the effect of the auroral currents. Magnetic observatories recorded disturbances in Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s field so extreme that magnetometer traces were driven off scale, and telegraph networks around the world\u00e2\u0080\u0094the \u00e2\u0080\u009cVictorian Internet\u00e2\u0080\u009d9\u00e2\u0080\u0094experienced major disruptions and outages. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe electricity which attended this beautiful phenomenon took possession of the magnetic wires throughout the country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin reported, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand there were numerous side displays in the telegraph offices where fantastical and unreadable messages came through the instruments, and where the atmospheric fireworks assumed shape and substance in brilliant sparks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d10 In several locations, operators disconnected their systems from the batteries and sent messages using only the current induced by the aurora.11 The auroras were the visible manifestation of two powerful magnetic storms that occurred near the peak of the sunspot cycle. The two storms, which occurred in rapid succession, are referred as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cCarrington Event\u00e2\u0080\u009d in honor of Richard Carrington, a British amateur astronomer. On September 1, the day before the onset of the second storm, Carrington had observed an outburst of \u00e2\u0080\u009ctwo patches of intensely bright and white light\u00e2\u0080\u009d12 from a large and complex group of sunspots near the center of the Sun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disk. Although the connection was not understood at the time, Carrington\u00e2\u0080\u0099s observation provided the first evidence that erup- tive activity on the Sun is the ultimate cause of geomagnetic storms. We know today that what Carrington observed was an extraordinarily intense white-light flare that was associated with a powerful, fast-moving coronal mass ejection (CME). The CME and the shock wave that preceded it impacted Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s magnetosphere some 17.5 hours after Carrington\u00e2\u0080\u0099s observation, triggering an unusually severe geomagnetic storm. In addition to the low-latitude auroras and intense auroral currents responsible for the telegraph outages, all of the phenomena known today to be characteristic of a major magnetic storm occurred as well, although the mid-19th century lacked the means to detect and measure them, and its most sophisticated technologies were unaffected by them: an increased Earthward flow of magnetospheric plasma, creating or intensifying the ring current; the explosive release of stored magnetic energy in multiple magnetospheric substorms; an increase in the energy content of the radiation belts as well as the possible creation of temporary new belts; and changes in the ionospheric and thermospheric density at midlatitudes. Recent analysis of ice core data indicates that the geomagnetic storm was also ac- companied by a solar energetic particle event four times more intense than the most severe solar energetic particle event of the space age. By this as well as other measures, the Carrington Event ranks as one of the most severe space weather events\u00e2\u0080\u0094and by some measures the most severe\u00e2\u0080\u0094on record.13 Locations of reported auroral observations during the first ~1.5 hours of the September 2, 1859, magnetic 1.2 Green.eps storm (orange dots).

But managing the effects of severe space weather is not just a technical problem: it is also, importantly, a problem of institutions and of society. A key issue affecting our ability to prevent disruption of large technical systems is the difficulty of developing the appropriate institutions to deal with the problem on a long-term basis. Institutional devel- opment occurs most often under conditions of frequent accidents or errors. When nothing bad appears to happen from one year to another, sustaining preparedness and planning in out-years is extraordinarily challenging. Consequently, space weather is not on the radar screen of many people outside the small technical community and some affected businesses. Dependency creep, risk migration, and new technologies are potential problems for operators of large technical systems. As systems become more complex, and as they grow in size, understanding and over- sight become more difficult. Subsystems and dependencies may evolve that escape the close scrutiny of organization operators. Dependencies allow risk present in one part the other overall system to \u00e2\u0080\u009cmigrate\u00e2\u0080\u009d to others, with potentially damaging results. GPS and electric power systems have clearly accelerated dependency creep, and consequent risk migration. New technologies, such as nanoscale components, may not be adequately understood in the context of 11-year solar cycles. One of the most fundamental concerns for operators of large technical systems is the efficiency-vul- nerability tradeoff\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, the question of how much reserve capacity is available to deal with uncertainty and contingencies. In stable protected environments, systems operate with excess capacity: costs are passed on to users and the society. In competitive-market but benign environments, however, systems operate at close to their efficiency frontiers. Slack resources are consumed, buffers shrink, costs fall, and profits rise. But in competitive-market and \u00e2\u0080\u009chostile\u00e2\u0080\u009d environments where unexpected developments perturb the system, finely tuned technical systems become brittle and have trouble operating outside relatively narrow parameters. Vulnerability can be the consequence of increased efficiency. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSecurity externalities\u00e2\u0080\u009d emerge due to interdependencies, lack of knowledge, lack of slack, lack of trust, and lack of ways to overcome coordination problems. Space storms of the magnitude of the Carrington Event are fortunately very rare, and the risk that such an event might cause a long-term catastrophic power grid collapse with major socio- economic disruptions, while real, is low. In the field of risk analysis, such an extreme event is termed a low-frequency/high-consequence (LF/HC) event. In terms of their potential broader, col- lateral impacts, LF/HC events present a unique set of problems for public (and private) institutions and governance, different from the problems raised by conventional, expected, and frequently experienced events. As a consequence, dealing with the collateral impacts of LF/HC events requires different types of budgeting and management capabilities and consequently challenges the basis for conventional policies and risk management strategies, which assume a universe of constant or reliable conditions. Moreover, because systems can quickly become dependent on new technologies in ways that are unknown and unexpected by both developers and users, vulnerabilities in one part of the broader system have a tendency to spread to other parts of the system. Consequently, it is difficult to understand, much less to predict, the consequences of future LF/HC events. Sustaining preparedness and planning for such events in future years is equally difficult (Box 1). ||||| Don't call it Solar Probe Plus anymore. \n \n NASA's upcoming sun-studying mission, which will come much closer to Earth's star than any spacecraft in history, has been renamed the Parker Solar Probe, agency officials announced today (May 31). \n \n The new moniker honors pioneering University of Chicago astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who predicted the existence of the solar wind \u2014 the stream of charged particles flowing constantly from the sun \u2014 back in 1958. [Solar Quiz: How Well Do You Know Our Sun?] \n \n NASA has named about 20 space missions after people; the Hubble Space Telescope is perhaps the most famous example. But the 89-year-old Parker is the first researcher to be celebrated in this manner while still alive, agency officials said. \n \n \"I'm certainly greatly honored to be associated with such a heroic scientific space mission,\" Parker said during a press conference at the University of Chicago today. \n \n An artist's illustration of NASA's Parker Solar Probe spacecraft, formerly known as Solar Probe Plus, studying the sun. The mission is scheduled to launch in July 2018. Credit: Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory \n \n The ambitious $1.5 billion Parker Solar Probe mission is scheduled to soar to solar orbit atop a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on July 31, 2018. \n \n Over the course of the next seven years, the spacecraft will perform 24 close flybys of the sun, some of which will bring it within just 3.9 million miles (6.2 million kilometers) of the solar surface. That's well inside the orbit of Mercury, and seven times closer than any other probe has ever gotten to the sun, NASA officials said. \n \n The environment in this region is extreme, to say the least: During its closest encounters, the 10-foot-long (3 meters) Parker Solar Probe is expected to experience temperatures of up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit (1,370 degrees Celsius) and solar radiation intensities 475 times greater than we're used to on Earth. \n \n Mission controllers will therefore retract the Parker Solar Probe's solar arrays as it approaches the sun and extend them as the spacecraft retreats, to keep panel power levels and temperatures from fluctuating too much. And the probe will be outfitted with a 7.5-foot-wide (2.3 m), 4.5-inch-thick (11.4 centimeters) heat shield made of advanced carbon-composite material, which will allow its four science instruments to operate at about room temperature, NASA officials said. \n \n The Parker Solar Probe will perform a number of tasks with this science gear, such as measure the sun's electric and magnetic fields, photograph solar structure and study the solar wind. \n \n If all goes according to plan, the Parker Solar Probe's observations will help mission scientists solve two long-standing puzzles: How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the sun's outer atmosphere, known as the corona, so much hotter than the solar surface (3 million degrees F, or 1.7 million degrees C, compared with 10,000 degrees F, or 5,500 degrees C)? \n \n This latter situation is akin to water flowing uphill, said Parker Solar Probe mission scientist Nicola Fox, of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland: \"It shouldn't happen.\" \n \n These two big questions can be answered only by getting up-close observations of the sun, Fox added. And the answers are not just of academic interest. \n \n \"One recent study by the National Academy of Sciences estimated that, without advance warning, a huge solar event could cause $2 trillion in damage in the U.S. alone, and the Eastern Seaboard of the U.S. could be without power for a year,\" researchers at APL, which manages the mission for NASA, wrote in an online description. \n \n \"In order to unlock the mysteries of the corona, but also to protect a society that is increasingly dependent on technology from the threats of space weather, we will send [the Parker Solar Probe] to touch the sun,\" they added. \n \n The Parker Solar Probe will carry a chip loaded with photographs of Eugene Parker and a copy of his seminal 1958 solar-wind paper, Fox said. NASA has also invited Parker to come up with an inscription for a plate that will be installed on the spacecraft, she added. \n \n Follow Mike Wall on Twitter @michaeldwall and Google+.

Understanding the sun in greater detail can also shed light on Earth and its place in the solar system, researchers said. \n \n This is NASA's first mission to the sun and its outermost atmosphere, called the corona. \n \n On Wednesday, the craft -- initially called the Solar Probe Plus -- was renamed the Parker Solar Probe in honor of astrophysicist Eugene Parker. \n \n \"This is the first time NASA has named a spacecraft for a living individual,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for the agency's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. \"It's a testament to the importance of his body of work, founding a new field of science that also inspired my own research and many important science questions NASA continues to study and further understand every day. I'm very excited to be personally involved honoring a great man and his unprecedented legacy.\" \n \n Parker published research predicting the existence of solar wind in 1958, when he was a young professor at the University of Chicago's Enrico Fermi institute. At the time, astronomers believed that the space between planets was a vacuum. Parker's first paper was rejected, but it was saved by a colleague, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, an astrophysicist who would be awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize for Physics. \n \n Less than two years after Parker's paper was published, his theory of solar wind was confirmed by satellite observations. His work revolutionized our understanding of the sun and interplanetary space. \n \n Parker is now the S. Chandrasekhar Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus at the University of Chicago. Zurbuchen and Nicola Fox, the mission project scientist for Parker Solar Probe, also presented Parker with the first scale model of the probe and NASA's distinguished public service medal. \n \n \"I'm greatly honored to be associated with such a heroic scientific space mission,\" Parker said. \n \n The Parker Solar Probe will carry a chip with photos of Parker and his revolutionary paper, as well as a plate carrying whatever inscription Parker wishes to provide -- his message to the sun. \n \n The probe will eventually orbit within 3.7 million miles of the sun's surface. The observations and data could provide insight about the physics of stars, change what we know about the mysterious corona, increase understanding of solar wind and help improve forecasting of major space weather events. Those events can impact satellites and astronauts as well as the Earth -- including the power grid and radiation exposure on airline flights, NASA said. \n \n The mission's objectives include \"tracing the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the sun's corona and solar wind, determining the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind and explore mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic particles.\" \n \n \"We've been inside the orbit of Mercury and done amazing things, but until you go and touch the sun, you can't answer these questions,\" Fox said. \"Why has it taken us 60 years? The materials didn't exist to allow us to do it. We had to make a heat shield, and we love it. Something that can withstand the extreme hot and cold temperature shifts of its 24 orbits is revolutionary.\" \n \n Solar wind is the flow of charged gases from the sun that is present in most of the solar system. That wind screams past Earth at a million miles per hour, and disturbances of the solar wind cause disruptive space weather that impacts our planet. \n \n Space weather may not sound like something that concerns Earth, but surveys by the National Academy of Sciences have estimated that a solar event without warning could cause $2 trillion in damage in the United States and leave parts of the country without power for a year. \n \n In order to reach an orbit around the sun, the Parker Solar Probe will take seven flybys of Venus that will essentially give the probe a gravity assist, shrinking its orbit around the sun over the course of nearly seven years. \n \n The probe will eventually be closer to the sun than Mercury. It will be close enough to watch solar wind whip up from subsonic to supersonic. \n \n When closest to the sun, the probe's 4\u00bd-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shields will have to withstand temperatures close to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. Due to its design, the inside of the spacecraft and its instruments will remain at a comfortable room temperature. \n \n The probe will reach a speed of 450,000 mph around the sun. On Earth, this speed would enable someone to get from Philadelphia to Washington in one second, the agency said. The mission will also pass through the origin of the solar particles with the highest energy. \n \n The mission is scheduled to end in June 2025. \n \n \"The solar probe is going to a region of space that has never been explored before,\" Parker said. \"It's very exciting that we'll finally get a look. One would like to have some more detailed measurements of what's going on in the solar wind. I'm sure that there will be some surprises. There always are.\" ||||| A future solar exploring spacecraft will change the understanding of the sun by aiming straight for our solar system's star. NASA revealed new details Wednesday about the first mission to visit the sun. \n \n During a news conference at the University of Chicago, NASA officials announced that the spacecraft would be called the Parker Solar Probe in honor of astrophysicist Eugene Parker, credited with discovering solar wind. \n \n On track for a summer 2018 launch, the spacecraft will rely on incredible feats of engineering that will allow the probe to touch the sun. A 4.5-inch thick carbon-composite solar shield will protect the probe from temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit while keeping the science instruments at room temperature. \n \n Join us at 11am ET to learn more about humanity's first mission to visit a star: https://t.co/ECEIXnuSer pic.twitter.com/7R4GZOm5w0 \u2014 NASA Sun & Space (@NASASun) May 31, 2017 \n \n The spacecraft will be equipped with a thermal protection system and a solar array cooling system to protect it from the blazing sun. \n \n \n \n The arrays, or panels, will retract and extend as the spacecraft moves around the sun, keeping it at a safe temperature and also powering it with the sun. \n \n \n \n Parker Solar Probe's science objects include tracing the energy behind solar wind, understand the heating of the solar corona and to determine what accelerates the solar wind, according to the mission website. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star, including finding out why the sun\u2019s corona is so much hotter than its surface,\u201d said mission scientist Nicola Fox, with Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. \n \n The findings will help answer questions about how stars work and improve space weather forecasting. \n \n \n \n After launch, Parker Solar Probe will make a Venus flyby before reaching its first perihelion or the closest point to the sun. The spacecraft will then repeat that flyby of the perihelion routine 23 more times over its lifetime until 2025. \n \n \n \n On the final orbits Parker Solar Probe will fly within 9 solar radii, or nine times the radius of the sun, of the sun\u2019s \u201csurface,\u201d seven times closer than any other spacecraft has been to the sun before. \n \n \n \n The 20-day launch window opens July 31, 2018.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 NASA is going to the sun. More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge.",

Whether it's in the street or in rap, the Atlanta representative has held his own when things got troublesome, so what's a couple of baby mothers to him? \n \n The premise of Lo's upcoming reality show \"All My Babies' Mamas\" got critics in a tizzy, but it doesn't seem like the \"Dey Know\" rapper is sweating things very much. \n \n In an exclusive interview with MTV News, L-O made it clear that he was not at liberty to discuss the upcoming Oxygen show, but he did spell out his life story for us, including his role as a father of 11 and the balancing act he must maintain among his 10 baby mamas. \n \n \"You can hate all you want to, I didn't ask for it. It just happened. Now that it happened, I'm supposed to turn my back against it?\" Shawty Lo told MTV News about his 11 children and untraditional family structure. \"If I wasn't taking care of my kids then you would really dog me out, but I'm taking care of my kids, providing for my family. I don't know what else to say.\" \n \n Growing up, the ATL trap rapper faced many hardships. His mother was hooked on drugs, his dad wasn't around and his grandmother who raised him died from cancer by the time he turned 17. Having to fend for himself, Shawty Lo turned to the streets to make ends meet. \n \n \"I came to be one of the largest drug dealers to come from Atlanta, Bankhead area and I started havin' kids. When the money came, a lot of women came,\" he said, estimating he was a millionaire by the time he turned 21. \"Once you feel like a girl was your girlfriend or whatever, the rubber probably came off,\" he said candidly. \"They wouldn't have an abortion. They used to take the money and run with it, and they'd have a baby by the most popular guy in the street, and that's how I had all them kids.\" \n \n After the pilot for \"All My Babies' Mamas\" hit the Net in late December, Lo and show producers came under a ton of scrutiny, with some even calling for a boycott. But Shawty Lo insists he is a good dad, and contrary to what people may feel, he doesn't have as much baby-mama drama as folks think. \n \n \"I take care of all my kids. ... Outta all the 10 baby mamas, I just have problems outta one. That's it,\" he said. \"She has two kids by me, and she feel like I'm supposed to do more for her kids, and she don't wanna work. She just want me to straight take care of them, but it's all love. I handle it.\" \n \n The proud papa doesn't want people to focus on the amount of kids he has, but the fact that he takes care of all of his offspring. \"It's a lot of fathers don't take care of one; I gotta deal with 11. I gotta deal with nine girls and two boys,\" he said. \n \n It isn't just about spending money either, Shawty Lo advises all fathers to spend time with their children. \n \n \"Even if you ain't got the money, you gotta be a father to your child. You need to be in your child's life, 'cause that means a lot to them,\" he said. \"Comin' up, we didn't have Thanksgiving, we didn't have Christmas, but if I had my father there, if I even had my mother there, I probably wouldn't have been that person I was in the streets.\" \n \n Do you agree with Shawty Lo's take on fatherhood?

    "document": "Ford Motor Co., the second-largest U.S. automaker, said it will protect its Ford script and oval logo from use by supporters of embattled Toronto Mayor Rob Ford. \n \n Rob Ford, 44, yesterday signed shirts emblazoned with \ufffdFord Nation\ufffd incorporating the automaker\ufffds logo at a United Way charity event, the National Post newspaper reported. The mayor said for the first time Wednesday he bought illegal drugs while in office after admitting last week to using crack cocaine and being drunk in public. \n \n \ufffdFord did not grant permission for use of its logo,\ufffd Jay Cooney, a company spokesman, said Wednesday by telephone. \ufffdWe view it as an unauthorized use of our trademark and have asked it to be stopped.\ufffd \n \n Ford reclaimed control of its blue oval logo last year after using it and other assets as collateral to borrow $23.4 billion in 2006 which allowed the company to weather the global financial crisis. The Dearborn-based company regained control after Moody\ufffds Investors Service became the second major ratings company to upgrade the carmaker to investment grade. \n \n Rob Ford\ufffds revelation Wednesday that he purchased illegal drugs while in office came amid questioning at a city hall meeting in which a majority of city councilors asked him to take a leave of absence to address his \ufffdchallenges.\ufffd \n \n Ford rose 2.3 percent to $17.10 at the close in New York.

Drinking and driving. A hooker visiting City Hall. Showing up impaired at a military charity ball for injured soldiers. Connections to criminals. \n \n The Toronto Police Service has built a huge file of allegations on Mayor Rob Ford\u2019s improper activities, new court documents reveal. Much of it coming from Ford staffers who bought the mayor booze, say they knew of his substance abuse problems and stood by while the mayor lied to the city, saying he had no problems and there was no crack video. \n \n Those same staffers knew the mayor avoided \u201cethnic events\u201d he was asked to attend, and kept light hours, typically working 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., and frequently disappeared for lengthy stretches of time, the document states. An earlier Star story revealed police surveillance caught Ford calling or meeting an alleged drug dealer and his pals many times during regular business hours. \n \n And, tucked amidst a sad collection of binge drinking and repulsive behaviour (Ford, married with two children, allegedly told a young female security guard at city hall he \u201cwas going to eat her box\u201d) is a window into the world of Rob and Doug, the brothers Ford, who police learned have an intense rivalry with each other. \n \n \u201cDoug Ford and Mayor Ford have a very interesting relationship,\u201d detectives were told when they interviewed Mark Towhey, the mayor\u2019s former chief of staff. \u201cDoug Ford believes that Mayor Ford owes everything he has to him and vice versa.\u201d \n \n As Ford defended himself at city hall Wednesday, Justice Ian Nordheimer released a second batch of allegations against Ford, contained in a search warrant application used in the police case against Ford friend and occasional driver Alexander \u201cSandro\u201d Lisi. Lisi, who was previously convicted of threatening to kill a woman, is facing charges of drug trafficking and extortion, the latter in connection with an alleged attempt to retrieve the crack video. None of the allegations have been proven in court and the mayor has not been charged. The documents \u2014 parts are still blacked out \u2014 do not say who allegedly instructed Lisi to retrieve the video of Ford smoking crack cocaine and making racial and homophobic slurs. \n \n The newly revealed documents raised the temperature of the Fords, already warmed by a day that saw fellow city politicians urge the mayor to take a leave of absence. \u201cBe very careful on what you write,\u201d Mayor Ford warned reporters repeatedly as the day drew to a close. \n \n Long before the May 16 news of the crack video\u2019s existence, Ford staffers had allegedly endured physical violence and abuse from Mayor Ford, and witnessed a municipal politician more at home drinking vodka in a schoolyard than attending committee meetings at city hall. \n \n When detectives, following revelations in the Star and on Gawker.com, went on the hunt for Ford information they quickly learned that staffers had a serious concern that Ford was drinking and driving, sometimes in a school zone. One former staffer, Chris Fickel, told police he frequently had to buy vodka \u2014 it was always the Iceberg brand \u2014 for Ford. Fickel said other staffers including Nico Fidani, Kia Nejatian, Michael Prempeh, Amin Massoudi and Isaac Shirokoff also purchased vodka for Ford when the mayor asked. \n \n Fickel said on one occasion, in the fall of 2012, he was a passenger in Ford\u2019s Escalade and the mayor was driving and talking football. On hand was Payman Aboodowleh, a friend and assistant football coach on Ford\u2019s team. Aboodowleh has a criminal record for theft and assaulting a police officer. According to Fickel, \u201cthe mayor pulled his car over (likely at a high school, was Fickel\u2019s recollection) and grabbed an LCBO paper bag from in front of the passenger seat which contained a fresh bottle of vodka and drank the 11 or 12 oz. mickey in one-two minutes going back and forth with a Gatorade.\u201d \n \n Fickel said he got out of the Escalade soon after and Ford kept driving. Fickel noted to detectives that Ford quickly became \u201crambling and incoherent\u201d after drinking. There is no indication that any of these staffers contacted police with concerns Ford was drinking and driving. \n \n In two videos the Toronto Star has seen \u2014 the video where Ford rants he is going to kill someone and the crack video \u2014 Ford is incoherent and rambling. \n \n The police document has numerous references to times when Ford appeared severely impaired. There are other points when, usually at a time when Ford is under the influence of something (staff are never sure what, but in interviews with police some say it may be cocaine) Ford allegedly tries to hurt one of his young staffers. These alleged assaults have been the subject of police inquiry, but no charges have been laid. \n \n One night at a strip club, the police document states, \u201cthe Mayor assaulted (Isaac) Shirokoff,\u201d a special assistant to Ford who is now a graduate student at Queen\u2019s University. \u201cThis happened one night when they were out at a strip club and the mayor was doing cocaine.\u201d The information was relayed to police by former staffer Chris Fickel. Shirokoff has been asked to comment on this allegation previously, but has denied it to the Star. Shirokoff refused to give a statement to police. \n \n Other people allegedly assaulted by Ford include current chief of staff Earl Provost and former staffer Brooks Barnett, according to the police document, which records the allegations but does not say if they are pursuing charges. \n \n In one section, the document describes how Ford called three staffers \u201cLiberal bitches\u201d and \u201cLiberal hacks\u201d and how he pushed one of them, roughly into the wall at city hall. That night, the now infamous Bier Markt night that included a drunken romp at city hall, Ford drank heavily from a 40 ounce bottle of vodka, the police document states. A woman present that night at city hall was rumoured to be a prostitute that Ford had previously been seen with at a stag. \n \n The account of the night, as told to detectives, includes a description of how a drunken Ford began crying about his father. Ford crying is mentioned several times in the document, with staffers saying Ford cried when he lost his job coaching Don Bosco\u2019s football team, and was at his father\u2019s grave (his late father was a provincial MPP) late one night, sounding impaired, and calling them in tears from his cellular phone. \n \n The document paints a picture of a mayor\u2019s office out of control, mostly staffed by young, inexperienced people drawn, from time to time, from Ford\u2019s football world. Among the few older people were Dave Price, Ford\u2019s former football coach from high school days, George Christopoulos, once a public relations officer for the Toronto police and Towhey, who had a military and consulting background. The youngsters ran errands, buying vodka for the mayor or picking up his drycleaning. One former staffer, Jennifer Dwyer, had serious concerns that Ford was driving impaired, police were told. \n \n Dwyer and fellow staffer Kia Nejatian had arrived in the spring of 2012 to collect Ford from his house and take him to an event. \u201cFord appeared to be under the influence and impaired. He looked red faced, sweating and was talking quickly,\u201d Nejatian told police. Ford told Dwyer, a young woman, to hop in his Escalade and they drove off. Nejatian told police that Dwyer was concerned because Ford seemed to be driving impaired and because he made her accompany him to a \u201crough neighbourhood\u201d to give money to a football player Ford knew. \n \n Some of the frustration the detectives on the case have faced is clear. When detectives went to talk to Dwyer, she did not corroborate Nejatian\u2019s story. \n \n On the Bier Markt night in 2012, St. Patrick\u2019s Day, Ford was intent on going out on the town, Ford took a taxi with some of his staffers. According to what staffers later told police investigating allegations involving Ford, the mayor \u201cstarted calling the taxi driver a \u201cPaki,\u201d threw business cards at him and made mocking fake language sounds. \n \n The Bier Markt incident included, staff told police, a woman they believed was a prostitute or \u201cescort\u201d who knew Ford. She is described by staff as young, petite, and blonde. The woman knew Ford from a stag he had attended and Ford was concerned that his staff be \u201cdiscreet\u201d around her. Former staffer Isaac Ransom told police there have long been \u201crumours\u201d that Ford uses \u201cescorts or prostitutes.\u201d That night, which included a visit from Ford friend and former TTC employee Peter Kordas, Ford said he wanted to \u201cget laid\u201d and smoke hashish or marijuana, according to the police document. In one section it describes Ford allegedly doing a \u201cbump\u201d of cocaine off his own wrist. \n \n The document also sheds more light on the Garrison Ball in 2013, a story reported by the Star prior to the crack video story. \n \n According to the police document, Ford had been away on vacation and was returning to attend the military ball. Staffers told police Ford showed up with his kids and he was \u201cout of it.\u201d At one point, detectives were told, Ford tried to put chief of staff Mark Towhey in a \u201cheadlock.\u201d \n \n Prior to the ball, Towhey was trying to reach Ford and called Ford friend Lisi, which led to him speaking with the mayor by phone. Lisi was driving, police were told. \n \n According to the police document: \u201cThe mayor was talking very quickly and was almost incoherent. He had his children with him. Towhey did not feel the mayor was in a presentable state so he told him to not bother attending.\u201d \n \n But Ford was determined to attend. Towhey, the police document states, warned Ford it would not go well for him if he attended, telling him if he attended impaired \u201chis career as a politician would be over.\u201d \n \n Ford did attend, driven by Lisi, with friend Bruno Bellissimo, a crack addict, in the Escalade with the Ford children. A Ford staffer was delegated to take the two young children to McDonald\u2019s while Ford, stumbling, made his way around the important military ball. After the ball (the Star has reported that Ford was asked to leave) Towhey took all evening events off the calendar for Ford. \n \n The document also describes Ford\u2019s response on May 17, the day a front page story in the Star detailed the crack video. \n \n Towhey told police he advised Ford to take one of three suggested courses of action: Fight and try and \u201cbulldoze\u201d his way through the controversy; Resign; or take a leave of absence. \n \n Shortly after he presented these options, Ford fired Towhey. Staffers told police that Ford enjoyed when staffers who left his employ had to do the \u201cwalk of shame\u201d as they publicly left the office. \n \n According to former press secretary Christopoulos, who spoke to police, Ford came up with his own unscripted response. \n \n \u201cI do not do crack cocaine, I do not do this and the Star sucks,\u201d Christopolous told detectives.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 For your average big city mayor, admitting that you bought illegal drugs while in office would be the most damaging thing to happen in a day\u2014but Rob Ford's not your average mayor. Soon after a press conference in which the crack-smoking, binge-drinking Toronto mayor claimed his closet was empty of skeletons, a judge released evidence from witnesses\u2014mainly Ford staffers\u2014who alleged he had abused drugs including cocaine and OxyContin, partied with prostitutes at City Hall, racially abused a taxi driver, and attacked several staff members, reports the Globe and Mail, the Toronto Star, and the National Post. Among the partially redacted allegations included in a huge police dossier on Ford's activities: Ford staffers worried about how their boss often drove drunk, sometimes in school zones. One staffer told police he was in the car with Ford when the mayor downed a 12-ounce bottle of vodka in a few swigs, chasing it with Gatorade. He says Ford was frequently so drunk he was \"rambling and incoherent\"\u2014and he and other junior staff members were often sent to buy alcohol. Staff members told police that some women came to the mayor's office saying Ford had told them they could have a job after they smoked joints with him outside of bars. St. Patrick's Day last year appears to have been a wild night even by Rob Ford standards, the police documents reveal. During celebrations, staffers say Ford drank heavily from a bottle of vodka and was seen at City Hall with a woman believed to be an escort. Against staffers' advice, Ford\u2014who talked about \"going out then getting laid\"\u2014then took a taxi to a bar, calling the driver a \"Paki\" and throwing a handful of business cards at him. He later moved on to a second bar, where a waiter says he saw Ford and an unknown woman apparently snorting cocaine. After an intoxicated Ford stormed the dance floor, he was asked to leave. He then returned to City Hall, where he continued to drink, attacked two staffers, and made lewd remarks to a female security guard before staffers managed to get him into a taxi home, according to witness statements. Upon arrival at the residence, a staffer who accompanied Ford says the drunken mayor got in his own car and sped off. Toronto's city council has voted 37 to 5 to ask Ford to step down, at least temporarily, but the increasingly isolated mayor is adamant about staying on. Meanwhile, Ford Motor Co. has told the mayor and his supporters to stop using its logo on T-shirts and other items, reports the Detroit News, and organizers of this year's Santa Claus Parade have asked Ford to stay away.

(Associated Press) \n \n Sierra Club executive director Michael Brune also was arrested _ the first time in the group's 120-year history that a club leader was arrested in an act of civil disobedience. The club's board of directors approved the action as a sign of its opposition to the $7 billion pipeline, which would carry oil derived from tar sands in western Canada to refineries along the Texas Gulf Coast. \n \n Activist Bill McKibben, actress Daryl Hannah and NASA climate scientist James Hansen also were arrested, along with more than 40 others. They were charged with failure to disperse and obey lawful orders, and released on $100 bond each. \n \n The protesters are demanding that President Barack Obama reject the pipeline, which they say would carry \"dirty oil\" that contributes to global warming. They also worry about a spill. \n \n Many business and labor groups support the 1,700-mile pipeline as a source of jobs and a step toward North American energy independence. \n \n The 4-year-old project has become a flashpoint in the debate over climate change, with opponents labeling it a \"carbon bomb\" that could trigger global warming. Supporters call that rhetoric overblown and say Obama should approve the pipeline as part of his \"all of the above\" energy policy, which encourages a wide range of domestic energy development. \n \n In an interview before his arrest, Brune said civil disobedience was justified because of the threat posed by tar sands oil, which is difficult to produce and emits significantly more greenhouse gases than conventional oil. The Sierra Club is the nation's oldest and largest environmental group and generally shies away from extreme tactics. \n \n \"We want to send a strong message that we expect the president's ambitions to meet the scale of the challenge and reject a pipeline that carries dirty, thick oil\" that contributes to global warming, Brune said. The president's supporters want Obama to \"fight with both fists\" against climate change, Brune said. \n \n The made-for-media protest came ahead of a rally planned for Sunday on the National Mall, where organizers are expecting at least 20,000 people to protest the tar sands pipeline and urge Obama to act forcefully on climate change. \n \n Kennedy, president of the Waterkeeper Alliance, a New York-based environmental group, said he was being arrested \"with regret,\" noting that he would prefer to contest the pipeline in court _ and may eventually do so. \n \n Kennedy, whose father was an attorney general and U.S. senator, called the pipeline \"a boondoggle of monumental proportions\" that will \"ruin the lives of millions of people,\" through increased carbon pollution and likely spills. \n \n Obama was visiting a manufacturing plant in North Carolina when the demonstration occurred. As he made his way to a factory in Asheville, protesters held signs saying \"Stop coal\" and \"No to Keystone.\" \n \n Obama has called climate change a serious threat and in his State of the Union speech Tuesday night urged Congress to combat the phenomenon. If Congress fails to act, he will use executive authority to take steps to cut greenhouse gas pollution and encourage increased use of cleaner sources of energy, Obama said. \n \n Obama has twice thwarted the Keystone XL pipeline because of concerns over its route through sensitive land in Nebraska, but has not indicated how he will decide on the pipeline now that Nebraska's governor has approved a new route. The State Department has authority over the project, because it crosses an international border, but most observers expect Obama to make the final decision. \n \n Bond, former chairman of the NAACP, said he participated in the pipeline protest \"because I'm an American and I'm worried about the planet.\" He called the pipeline a human-rights issue, since many landowners in the six states where it will travel have been unable to resist Calgary-based TransCanada, the pipeline operator, as it seizes their property. \n \n Bond also said the pipeline will exacerbate pollution problems near the Houston refineries where it will be processed, including neighborhoods where minorities predominate. The pipeline will travel through Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma before reaching Texas. \n \n Bond, 73, said he was unhappy at the prospect of being arrested. \"My mother told me I'd never get a job\" if he got arrested, he said. \n \n As Bond and others were being arrested, the American Petroleum Institute, the largest lobbying group for the oil industry, again urged Obama to approve the project. The group said it will pay for ads supporting the pipeline and will mobilize grassroots events across the country urging Obama's approval. \n \n API President Jack Gerard called Keystone XL \"the most thoroughly vetted major infrastructure project in the nation's history\" and noted that TransCanada has agreed to 57 special conditions sought by the U.S. government to ensure environmental safety. \n \n With the unemployment rate hovering near 8 percent, \"getting people into these new jobs is critical,\" Gerard said. \n \n In the past week, nine people have been arrested in attempts to disrupt the pipeline's construction through Oklahoma. One of the eight people arrested Monday near Schoolton, Okla., had attached himself to a crane and was freed by a firefighter using bolt cutters. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writer Josh Lederman in Asheville, N.C., contributed to this report. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Matthew Daly on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MatthewDalyWDC ||||| Holy geez, we can't wait to hear Swift sing about this one! \n \n Conor Kennedy was arrested this afternoon at the White House!! \n \n Po-Po slapped cuffs on his pretty little wrists and hauled his famous behind off to the slammer! \n \n Conor, Robert F.

Yards Eslami, 25, a student at nearby Touro University, said she hoped police would \"do more patrols on the island.... Hopefully they'll find her. Our prayers are with the family.\" \n \n The FBI and the Solano County Office of Emergency Services are helping in the search, Vallejo police said. Anyone with information on Huskins\u2019 whereabouts are asked to call Vallejo police at (800) 488-9383 or Crime Stoppers at (707) 644-STOP. \n \n Twitter: @leeromney \n \n For breaking California news, follow @JosephSerna. ||||| VALLEJO (CBS13) \u2014 A Vallejo woman may the victim of a kidnapping and may be behind held for ransom. \n \n Vallejo Police continued its search for Denise Huskins, 30, and is releasing little information about her disappearance.

He told police that Huskins was forcibly taken against her will from her Mare Island home early Monday morning and that a ransom demand had been made.He called police several hours after she disappeared, but police have not explained why it took him so long to report the crime. Police are interviewing her boyfriend, 30-year-old Aaron Quinn, but they don't consider him a suspect or a person of interest.Police say they found Huskins' car, a white 2000 Toyota Camry with California license plate No. 4GQA436, at an undisclosed location in Vallejo. Investigators believe her car was taken from the block where she was abducted.Huskins was employed as a physical therapist at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Vallejo and had previously worked at Southern California Orthopedic Institute in Valencia, according to her Facebook page. The Southern California native moved to Vallejo from Toluca Lake in June 2014.Her parents live in Huntington Beach, where Huskins grew up, but were not home when Eyewitness News tried to get in touch with them.

That's my biggest fear, is that she's going through such horror. She doesn't deserve that,\" Mike Huskins said.At a news conference in Vallejo Monday night, police said they are focusing their search for her on the straits surrounding Mare Island because an object was found.\"The intention is for the dive team to go into the water and discover, or I should say to look at what this object that they've discovered to be. And at this point we have no idea what that is,\" said Vallejo Police Department Lt. Kenny Park.Authorities did not give a reason as to why her boyfriend waited so long to report her disappearance, but did say he is cooperating with investigators.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The details of Denise Huskins' kidnapping are sketchy, but scary: At some point between midnight and 5am Monday, boyfriend Aaron Quinn says he saw her being \"forcibly taken against her will\" from a Vallejo, Calif., home. He was given a ransom demand; it's not clear when or how it was delivered. About 12 hours after her abduction, at around 2pm Monday, he reported her missing to police. But police say the 30-year-old Quinn has not been identified as a suspect in the disappearance of Huskins, a 29-year-old physical therapist from Vallejo, the Los Angeles Times reports. Many details are fuzzy, but CBS Sacramento reports that the home from which Huskins was taken is Quinn's, though some outlets reported it was hers. The station also notes that a 2000 Toyota Camry believed to have been used in the kidnapping belongs to Quinn, though some outlets reported it as belonging to Huskins. The Camry was found elsewhere in the city; police believe it was taken from the block where Huskins was abducted, ABC7 reports. The Times says Huskins has lived at her own place in Vallejo since June, while NBC Bay Area speaks to others who also clarify that she didn't live with Quinn, but happened to be there when she was abducted. Both she and Quinn work at Kaiser Permanente. Police are releasing few other details other than noting that they do consider this a \"kidnapping for ransom\" case, but they say a mysterious \"object\" was spotted in a nearby waterway; a dive team will investigate, KCRA reports. All police will say regarding Quinn is that he's cooperating and \"hopefully we can extract information from him in a way that we can resolve this in a positive manner.\" The FBI is assisting with the search.",

    "document": "This is a basic principle: until it is proven otherwise, beyond a reasonable doubt, it\u2019s important to extend the presumption of innocence to Dylan Farrow, and presume that she is not guilty of the crime of lying about what Woody Allen did to her. \n \n If you are saying things like \u201cWe can\u2019t really know what happened\u201d and extra-specially pleading on behalf of the extra-special Woody AllenHi, The Daily Beast!, then you are saying that his innocence is more presumptive than hers. You are saying that he is on trial, not her: he deserves judicial safeguards in the court of public opinion, but she does not. \n \n The damnably difficult thing about all of this, of course, is that you can\u2019t presume that both are innocent at the same time. One of them must be saying something that is not true. But \u201che said, she said\u201d doesn\u2019t resolve to \u201clet\u2019s start by assuming she\u2019s lying,\u201d except in a rape culture, and if you are presuming his innocence by presuming her mendacity, you are rape cultured. It works both ways, or should: if one of them has to be lying for the other to be telling the truth, then presuming the innocence of one produces a presumption of the other\u2019s guilt. And Woody Allen cannot be presumed to be innocent of molesting a child unless she is presumed to be lying to us. His presumption of innocence can only be built on the presumption that her words have no credibility, independent of other (real) evidence, which is to say, the presumption that her words are not evidence. If you want to vigorously claim ignorance\u2013to assert that we can never know what happened, in that attic\u2013then you must ground that lack of knowledge in the presumption that what she has said doesn\u2019t count, and we cannot believe her story. \n \n To be blunt: I think Woody Allen probably did it, though, of course, I could be wrong. But it\u2019s okay if I\u2019m wrong. For two reasons. First, because my opinion is not attached to a juridical apparatus\u2014because I have not been empowered by jails and electric chairs and states of exception to destroy people\u2019s lives\u2014it isn\u2019t necessary for me to err heavily on the side of \u201cwe need to be really fucking sure that the accused did it.\u201d It\u2019s a good thing, generally, that juries are empowered to say \u201cWe think the accused is probably guilty, but we\u2019re not sure beyond a reasonable doubt, so we will not convict.\u201d That bar is set high for a reason; if you\u2019re going to lock a person in a cage for a long time, you need to be really sure. But we are also empowered to say the same thing. We are also empowered to say \u201cWe think Woody Allen probably molested a seven year old.\u201d And because we are not in a court of law, we don\u2019t even need to say the second part. The fact that we will not convict him doesn\u2019t even need to be implied. He is not, after all, on trial. \n \n The second reason it\u2019s okay if I\u2019m wrong is that I\u2019m probably not wrong. It\u2019s much more likely that I\u2019m right. Because I am not on Woody Allen\u2019s jury, I can be swayed by the fact that sexual violence is incredibly, horrifically common, much more common than it is for women to make up stories about sexual violence in pursuit of their own petty, vindictive need to destroy a great man\u2019s reputation. We are in the midst of an ongoing, quiet epidemic of sexual violence, now as always. We are not in the midst of an epidemic of false rape charges, and that fact is important here. All things being equal, it\u2019s more likely that the man who has spent a lifetime and a cinematic career walking the line of pedophilia (to put it mildly) is a likely candidate. All things being equal, the explanation that doesn\u2019t require you to imagine a conspiracy of angry women telling lies for no reason is probably the right one. It\u2019s a good thing that juries can\u2019t think this way, that they can\u2019t take account of Occam\u2019s Razor, because\u2014in theory\u2014the juridical system needs to get it right every single time (or at least hold tenaciously to that ambition). But you and I can recognize the bigger picture, because we aren\u2019t holding a person\u2019s life in our hands. Especially in situations like this one, the overwhelmingly more likely thing is that he did it. The overwhelmingly less likely thing is that a pair of bitter females\u2014driven by jealousy or by the sheer malignity of the gender\u2014have been lying about him for decades. \n \n What is the burden of proof for assuming that a person is lying? If you are a famous film director, it turns out to be quite high. You don\u2019t have to say a word in your defense, in fact, and people who have directed documentaries about you will write lengthy essays in the Daily Beast tearing down the testimony of your accusers. You can just go about your life making movie after movie, and it\u2019s fine. But if you are a woman who has accused a great film director of molesting you when you were seven, the starting point is the presumption that, without real evidence, you are not telling the truth. In the court of public opinion, a woman accusing a great film director of raping her has no credibility which his fans are bound to respect. He has something to lose, his good name. She does not, because she does not have a good name. She is living in hiding, under an assumed name. And when she is silent, the Daily Beast does not rise to her defense. \n \n In a rape culture, there is no burden on us to presume that she is not a liar, no necessary imperative to treat her like a person whose account of herself can be taken seriously. It is important that we presume he is innocent. It is not important that we presume she is not making it all up out of female malice. In a rape culture, you can say things like \u201cWe can\u2019t really know what really happened, so let\u2019s all act as if Woody Allen is innocent (and she is lying).\u201d In a rape culture, you can use your ignorance to cast doubt on her knowledge; you can admit that you have no basis for casting doubt on Dylan\u2019s statement, and then you can ignore her account of herself. A famous man is not speaking, so her testimony is not admissible evidence. His name is Woody Allen, and in a rape culture, that good name must be shielded and protected. What is her name? ||||| What is the burden of proof for assuming that a person is lying? If you are a famous film director, it turns out to be quite high.

Countless people have weighed in on this, many of them without the slightest idea of what the facts are in this matter. I consider myself allergic to gossip and tabloids, and go out of my way to avoid them. So when a celebrity is being devoured by the two-headed piranha of gossip and innuendo, I usually have minimal understanding of what they did, or were alleged to have done. Woody Allen is an exception. \n \n I produced and directed the two-part PBS special, Woody Allen: A Documentary , that premiered in the U.S. on the \u201cAmerican Masters\u201d series. I also supervised and consulted on the brief clip montage that aired as part of the recent Golden Globes telecast, when Allen received the Cecil B. DeMille Award for Lifetime Achievement. \n \n When I went online the morning after the Globes broadcast, I found more than one email asking if I had seen the previous night\u2019s tweets from Mia Farrow and her son, Ronan. A quick search led me not only to the accusatory tweets, but to the explosion of internet chatter that followed in their wake. The more benevolent comments suggested Woody should rot in jail. Others were demanding his head on a pike. \n \n Last fall, Vanity Fair magazine ran an article about Mia and her family, which included an interview with the 28-year-old Malone (n\u00e9e Dylan), who, at the age of seven, was at the center of Mia\u2019s allegations that made headlines during the brutal custody battle between her and Woody. In the recent interview, Malone stands behind her mother\u2019s accusation. It was the one-two punch of the Vanity Fair piece and the Farrow tweets that stirred up the hornet\u2019s nest that had remained somewhat dormant over the past 20 years. \n \n My documentary covered Allen\u2019s relationship with Soon-Yi Previn (Mia\u2019s adopted daughter and Woody\u2019s wife of 16 years) and the ensuing fall-out, but I chose not to go down the rabbit hole detailing the custody case, as my film was primarily about his work, and I had no interest in allowing it to turn into a courtroom drama. I did, however, thoroughly research the entire episode in order to reach my own conclusions about what did or didn\u2019t take place. \n \n My association with Woody is primarily a professional one, though we\u2019ve remained friendly since the documentary and still occasionally correspond by email via his assistant (since Woody still types on a 60-year old manual typewriter) . When I wrote him the day after the ceremony, he was vaguely aware that Mia and Ronan had badmouthed him (again), but he wasn\u2019t certain what Twitter was. (He\u2019s heard of blogging and always confuses the two.) Because he doesn\u2019t go online, he was blissfully unaware of how much ink (sorry, bandwidth) the story was getting. If he had known, he still wouldn\u2019t have cared. Mia\u2019s accusations were old business, and the fact that Ronan was publicly chiming in meant nothing to Woody, who hadn\u2019t even seen his (alleged) son for 20 years. I also knew Woody would never publicly respond to any of this. His indifference to the gossip has always struck me not as a decision so much as an involuntary and organic reaction. In fact, during a written exchange that day in which I mentioned the tweet attack, he was more focused on giving me advice about a stye I had on my eyelid that I joked was probably a brain tumor: \u201cI agree, you probably do have a brain tumor. You should get your affairs in order quickly as those things can move rather rapidly. You\u2019ll probably start to have some problems with your balance\u2014don\u2019t panic\u2014it\u2019s quite natural for a brain tumor.\u201d He then counseled me not to use up my \u201cremaining days\u201d fretting over Mia. \n \n As the day progressed, it seemed the misinformation on the internet was growing exponentially spurious by the minute. The more even-keeled bloggers and pundits were asking, \u201cIs it possible to separate the art from the artist?\u201d or \u201cIs America ready to forgive Woody Allen?\u201d The very phrasing of these questions presumed that Woody had done something terrible, and we had to decide how much we would let it bother us. My wife suggested that in absence of a response by Woody, he was being swiftboated. His silence created a vacuum that everybody with a keyboard was going to fill with whatever they believed or thought they believed or heard from someone else who heard from someone who linked to the Vanity Fair article. \n \n I considered whether to enter the fray, since my credentials were in order, so to speak. I had researched these events, I knew Woody\u2014was friendly with him, but we weren\u2019t so close that anyone could rightfully accuse me of being in his pocket. Quite the opposite in fact, as Woody had already advised me not to get involved. But as I came across more and more articles and blogs filled with misinformation, my wife said something to me that struck a chord: \u201cYou have just as much right to weigh in on this as anyone else, regardless of what Woody thinks.\u201d \n \n So here I go\u2014contributing to the very noise I\u2019ve been complaining about. \n \n ****************** \n \n There are basically two issues at play here. One is Woody\u2019s starting a romantic/sexual relationship with Mia\u2019s adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn, in 1991. The other is Mia\u2019s accusation\u2014used during their custody battle for their three shared children\u2014that Woody molested their 7-year-old adopted daughter Dylan. People tend to confuse these two issues, so let\u2019s examine them separately. \n \n First, the Soon-Yi situation: \n \n Every time I stumble upon this topic on the internet, it seems the people who are most outraged are also the most ignorant of the facts. Following are the top ten misconceptions, followed by my response in italics: \n \n #1: Soon-Yi was Woody\u2019s daughter. False. \n \n #2: Soon-Yi was Woody\u2019s step-daughter. False. \n \n #3: Soon-Yi was Woody and Mia\u2019s adopted daughter. False. Soon-Yi was the adopted daughter of Mia Farrow and Andr\u00e9 Previn. Her full name was Soon-Yi Farrow Previn. \n \n #4: Woody and Mia were married. False. \n \n #5: Woody and Mia lived together. False. Woody lived in his apartment on Fifth Ave. Mia and her kids lived on Central Park West. In fact, Woody never once stayed over night at Mia\u2019s apartment in 12 years. \n \n Get The Beast In Your Inbox! Daily Digest Start and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason. \n \n #6: Woody and Mia had a common-law marriage. False. New York State does not recognize common law marriage. Even in states that do, a couple has to cohabitate for a certain number of years. \n \n #7: Soon-Yi viewed Woody as a father figure. False. Soon-Yi saw Woody as her mother\u2019s boyfriend. Her father figure was her adoptive father, Andr\u00e9 Previn. \n \n #8: Soon-Yi was underage when she and Woody started having relations. False. She was either 19 or 21. (Her year of birth in Korea was undocumented, but believed to be either 1970 or \u201972.) \n \n #9: Soon-Yi was borderline retarded. Ha! She\u2019s smart as a whip, has a degree from Columbia University and speaks more languages than you. \n \n #10: Woody was grooming Soon-Yi from an early age to be his child bride. Oh, come on! According to court documents and Mia\u2019s own memoir, until 1990 (when Soon-Yi was 18 or 20), Woody \u201chad little to do with any of the Previn children, (but) had the least to do with Soon-Yi\u201d so Mia encouraged him to spend more time with her. Woody started taking her to basketball games, and the rest is tabloid history. So he hardly \u201chad his eye on her\u201d from the time she was a child. \n \n Let me add this: If anyone is creeped out by the notion of a 55-year old man becoming involved with his girlfriend\u2019s 19-year old adopted daughter, I understand. That makes perfect sense. But why not get the facts straight? If the actual facts are so repugnant to you, then why embellish them? \n \n It\u2019s understandable that Mia would remain furious with Woody for the rest of her life. If I were in Mia\u2019s position, I\u2019m sure I\u2019d feel the same way. (Though I\u2019d likely handle it as a private matter and not be tweeting about him being a pedophile, just before tweeting, \u201comfg look at this baby panda.\u201d) I also understand the simmering anger of Ronan Farrow (n\u00e9e Satchel), who has famously said of Allen, \u201cHe\u2019s my father married to my sister. That makes me his son and his brother-in-law. That is such a moral transgression.\u201d However, this particular dilemma might be resolved by Mia\u2019s recent revelations that Ronan\u2019s biological father may \u201cpossibly\u201d be Frank Sinatra, whom Farrow married in 1966, when she was 21 and the crooner was 50. \n \n While we\u2019re on the subject, a word about this Sinatra business: To even say that Ronan is \u201cpossibly\u201d Sinatra\u2019s son implies that Mia was fooling around with her ex-husband decades after their divorce. Backdating from Ronan\u2019s birthdate, it means that Farrow and Sinatra \u201chooked up\u201d in March of 1987 when Mia was 42 and Old Blue Eyes was 71. This sort of dispels the myth that Woody and Mia had this idyllic, loving, monogamous relationship until Woody threw it all away in 1992, since Mia was apparently diddling her ex, five years earlier. If Mia was \u201cjust kidding\u201d about the Sinatra scenario, it was an awfully insensitive thing to say, considering the fact that Sinatra\u2019s wife, Barbara, is still very much alive. Did Mia stop to think how her coy tease might be perceived by the widow Sinatra? One can only wonder if this also fits Ronan\u2019s definition of a \u201cmoral transgression.\u201d (One may also wonder whether Woody is owed a fortune in reimbursement for child support.) \n \n I am not here to slam Mia. I think she\u2019s an exceptional actress and I seriously admire her political activism. (I even follow her on Twitter.) But those who hate Woody \u201cfor what he did to Mia,\u201d should be reminded that if Sinatra was indeed Ronan\u2019s biological father, it\u2019s not the first time Mia had a child by a married man. In 1969, at the age of 24, she became pregnant by musician/composer Andr\u00e9 Previn, 40, who was still married to singer/songwriter Dory Previn. The betrayal is said to have led to Dory Previn\u2019s mental breakdown and institutionalization, during which she received electroconvulsive therapy. She would later write a song called, \u201cBeware of Young Girls\u201d about Mia. Maybe sleeping with your friend\u2019s husband doesn\u2019t earn as many demerits as sleeping with your girlfriend\u2019s adopted daughter, but if you\u2019re waving the \u201cNever Forget\u201d banner in Mia\u2019s honor, let\u2019s be consistent and take a moment to also remember the late Dory Previn. (Or better yet, let\u2019s forget the whole damn thing, considering it\u2019s none of our business.) \n \n ****************** \n \n Now, on to the more delicate issue of Mia\u2019s accusations during the custody case that Woody sexually abused Dylan/Malone. \n \n A brief but chilling synopsis of the accusation is as follows: On August 4, 1992, almost four months after the revelation about Woody and Soon-Yi\u2019s relationship understandably ignited a firestorm within the Farrow household, Woody was visiting Frog Hollow, the Farrow country home in Bridgewater, Connecticut, where Mia and several of her kids were staying. During an unsupervised moment, Woody allegedly took Dylan into the attic and, shall we say, \u201ctouched her inappropriately.\u201d Later in the day, it was alleged that the child was wearing her sundress, but that her underpants were missing. The following day, Mia\u2019s daughter allegedly told her mother what had happened, and Mia put the child\u2019s recounting of the story on videotape as evidence. \n \n Did this event actually occur? If we\u2019re inclined to give it a second thought, we can each believe what we want, but none of us know. Why does the adult Malone say it happened? Because she obviously believes it did, so good for her for speaking out about it in Vanity Fair. Her brother Ronan believes it happened, so good for him for sticking up for his sister in 140 characters or less. They\u2019ve both grown up in a household where this scenario has been accepted as indisputable fact, so why shouldn\u2019t they believe it? \n \n I know I\u2019m treading a delicate path here, and opening myself up to accusations of \u201cblaming the victim.\u201d However, I\u2019m merely floating scenarios to consider, and you can think what you will. But if Mia\u2019s account is true, it means that in the middle of custody and support negotiations, during which Woody needed to be on his best behavior, in a house belonging to his furious ex-girlfriend, and filled with people seething mad at him, Woody, who is a well-known claustrophobic, decided this would be the ideal time and place to take his daughter into an attic and molest her, quickly, before a house full of children and nannies noticed they were both missing. \n \n Even people who give Woody the benefit of the doubt and defend him on the internet are often confused on a few points. Some mistakenly say that the court found him \u201cnot guilty\u201d of the molestation charges. The fact is there was never such a ruling because he was never charged with a crime, since investigative authorities never found credible evidence to support Mia\u2019s (and Dylan\u2019s) claim. \n \n Let\u2019s back up a bit: Mia\u2019s allegations of molestation automatically triggered a criminal investigation by the Connecticut State Police, who brought in an investigative team from the Yale-New Haven Hospital, whose six-month long inquiry (which included medical examinations) concluded that Dylan had not been molested. I\u2019ve since read a recurring canard that Woody \u201cchose\u201d the investigative team. Yet nobody has suggested how or why Mia\u2019s team would ever outsource the investigation to a team \u201cchosen\u201d by Woody. Others have said that the investigators talked to psychiatrists \u201con Allen\u2019s payroll\u201d before letting him off the hook. The only way I can explain this is that the investigators, naturally, would have spoken with Woody\u2019s shrinks before giving him a clean bill of health. So technically, yeah, Woody\u2019s shrinks would have been paid a lot of money by Woody over the years. (Let\u2019s even call it an annuity.) The same would be true of his dentist, his eye doctor, and his internist. \n \n As for the evidentiary videotape of young Dylan\u2019s claims, it\u2019s been noted that there were several starts and stops in the recording, essentially creating in-camera \u201cedits\u201d to the young girl\u2019s commentary. This raises questions as to what was happening when the tape wasn\u2019t running. Was Mia \u201ccoaching\u201d her daughter off-camera, as suggested by the investigators? Mia says no\u2014she merely turned the camera on whenever Dylan starting talking about what Daddy did. Maybe we should take Mia at her word on this. Since I wasn\u2019t there, I think it\u2019s good policy not to presume what took place. \n \n The videotape and the medical exams weren\u2019t the only problems Mia faced in bringing abuse charges against her former lover. There were problems with inconsistencies in her daughter\u2019s off-camera narrative as well. A New York Times article dated March 26, 1993 , quotes from Mia\u2019s own testimony, during which she recalled taking the child to a doctor on the same day as the alleged incident. Farrow recalled, \u201cI think (Dylan) said (Allen) touched her, but when asked where, she just looked around and went like this,\u201d at which point Mia patted her shoulders. Farrow recalls she took Dylan to another doctor, four days later. On the stand, Allen\u2019s attorney asked Mia about the second doctor\u2019s findings: \u201cThere was no evidence of injury to the anal or vaginal area, is that correct?\u201d Farrow answered, \u201cYes.\u201d \n \n In the midst of the proceedings, on February 2, 1993, a revealing article appeared in the Los Angeles Times, headlined: \u201cNanny Casts Doubt on Farrow Charges,\u201d in which former nanny Monica Thompson (whose salary was paid by Allen, since three of the brood were also his) swore in a deposition to Allen\u2019s attorneys that she was pressured by Farrow to support the molestation charges, and the pressure led her to resign her position. Thompson had this to say about the videotape: \u201c\u201cI know that the tape was made over the course of at least two and perhaps three days. I recall Ms. Farrow saying to Dylan at that time, \u2018Dylan, what did daddy do\u2026 and what did he do next?\u2019 Dylan appeared not to be interested, and Ms. Farrow would stop taping for a while and then continue.\u201d \n \n Thompson further revealed a conversation she had with Kristie Groteke, another nanny. \u201cShe told me that she felt guilty allowing Ms. Farrow to say those things about Mr. Allen. (Groteke) said the day Mr. Allen spent with the kids, she did not have Dylan out of her sight for longer than five minutes. She did not remember Dylan being without her underwear.\u201d \n \n On April 20, 1993, a sworn statement was entered into evidence by Dr. John M. Leventhal, who headed the Yale-New Haven Hospital investigative team looking into the abuse charges. An article from the New York Times dated May 4, 1993, includes some interesting excerpts of their findings. As to why the team felt the charges didn\u2019t hold water, Leventhal states: \u201cWe had two hypotheses: one, that these were statements made by an emotionally disturbed child and then became fixed in her mind. And the other hypothesis was that she was coached or influenced by her mother. We did not come to a firm conclusion. We think that it was probably a combination.\u201d \n \n Leventhal further swears Dylan\u2019s statements at the hospital contradicted each other as well as the story she told on the videotape. \u201cThose were not minor inconsistencies. She told us initially that she hadn\u2019t been touched in the vaginal area, and she then told us that she had, then she told us that she hadn\u2019t.\u201d He also said the child\u2019s accounts had \u201ca rehearsed quality.\u201d At one point, she told him, \u201cI like to cheat on my stories.\u201d The sworn statement further concludes: \u201cEven before the claim of abuse was made last August, the view of Mr. Allen as an evil and awful and terrible man permeated the household. The view that he had molested Soon-Yi and was a potential molester of Dylan permeated the household\u2026 It\u2019s quite possible \u2014as a matter of fact, we think it\u2019s medically probable\u2014that (Dylan) stuck to that story over time because of the intense relationship she had with her mother.\u201d Leventhal further notes it was \u201cvery striking\u201d that each time Dylan spoke of the abuse, she coupled it with \u201cone, her father\u2019s relationship with Soon-Yi, and two, the fact that it was her poor mother, her poor mother,\u201d who had lost a career in Mr. Allen\u2019s films. \n \n Much is made by Mia\u2019s supporters over the fact that the investigative team destroyed their collective notes prior to their submission of the report. Also, the three doctors who made up the team did not testify in court, other than through the sworn deposition of team leader Leventhal. I have no idea if this is common practice or highly unusual. I won\u2019t wager a guess as to what was behind the destruction of the notes any more than I\u2019ll claim to know why Mia stopped and started her video camera while filming her daughter\u2019s recollections over a few days, or who was alleged to have leaked the tape of Dylan to others, or why Mia wouldn't take a lie detector test. (Woody took one and passed.) In any event, destruction of the notes may have been part of the reason that, despite the very conclusive position taken by the investigators that Dylan was not abused, presiding Judge Elliot Wilk found their report \u201cinconclusive.\u201d \n \n Judge Wilk would ultimately grant Mia custody of Satchel and Dylan. 15-year-old Moses chose not to see Woody, which was his right. It was a hard-won victory for Mia who returned home with eight of her nine children intact. She would go on to adopt six more, including Thaddeus Wilk Farrow, named in honor of the Honorable Judge Wilk. \n \n Woody was granted supervised visitation of Satchel, but his request for immediate visitation with Dylan was denied until the young girl underwent a period of therapy, after which a further review of visitation would be considered. As a legal matter, the investigation of possible criminal abuse would continue. \n \n Almost four months after Wilk\u2019s decision, the Connecticut authorities abandoned the criminal investigation, resulting in an unusual statement from Litchfield, Connecticut County Prosecutor Frank Maco, who dismissed the abuse charges against Woody, but still maintained that he had \u201cprobable cause\u201d to believe Dylan. In the minds of many, the decision would leave Woody in a kind of moral limbo. Legally, he was cleared of everything\u2014except a dark cloud of suspicion. Woody was furious, and called a press conference in which he referred to the state\u2019s attorney office as \u201ccowardly, dishonest and irresponsible. Even today, as they squirm, lie, sweat, and tap-dance, pathetically trying to save face and justify their moral squalor\u2026 there was no evidence against me. There is none now. I promise you, smear as they may, they will always claim to have evidence; but notice that somehow they will manage to find reasons why they can\u2019t quite show it to you.\u201d \n \n Woody\u2019s ad-hoc press conference made for good television and was widely covered in the press. Less widely disseminated was a news item that appeared in the New York Times five months later (Feb. 24, 1994), which reported that a disciplinary panel found the actions of County Prosecutor Frank Maco (the \u201cprobable cause\u201d guy) were cause for \u201cgrave concern\u201d and may have prejudiced the case. It winds up that Maco sent his \u201cprobable cause\u201d statement to the Surrogate\u2019s Court judge in Manhattan who was still deciding on Allen\u2019s adoption status of Dylan and Moses, which Mia was trying to annul. The panel wrote, \u201cIn most circumstances, [Maco\u2019s comments] would have violated the prosecutor\u2019s obligation to the accused. [His actions were] inappropriate, unsolicited, and potentially prejudicial.\u201d The article states that the agency could have voted sanctions against Maco ranging from censure to disbarment. Though the decision was quite damning, Maco got what amounted to a slap on the wrist. Two years later, the reprimand was overturned, but Mia was unsuccessful in her bid to annul the adoptions. Legally, Woody remains the adoptive father of Dylan and Moses. \n \n Moses Farrow, now 36, and an accomplished photographer, has been estranged from Mia for several years. During a recent conversation, he spoke of \u201cfinally seeing the reality\u201d of Frog Hollow and used the term \u201cbrainwashing\u201d without hesitation. He recently reestablished contact with Allen and is currently enjoying a renewed relationship with him and Soon-Yi. \n \n ****************** \n \n Life would go on for both Woody and Mia, respectively. Aside from tending to her growing family, Farrow would come to be recognized as a leading human rights advocate, with special concern for the plight of children in conflict-torn regions. She has worked diligently to bring attention to the Sudanese genocide in Darfur, and has made many trips to the region, receiving several awards for her humanitarian efforts in the process. Woody Allen would continue his ritual of writing and producing a film per-year\u2014an unprecedented pace he\u2019s maintained since 1969. The accolades and awards continue to pour in, and no one is less impressed than Allen, who has traditionally stayed away from all awards shows. \n \n In 1997, Woody and Soon-Yi would marry in Venice, Italy, and over the next few years adopt two daughters. Anyone who has adopted is familiar with the vetting process conducted by social workers and licensed government agencies charged with looking out for the child\u2019s welfare. Suffice it to say, the case of Woody and Soon-Yi was no exception, especially considering the highly-publicized events of 1992-93. Both adoptions, in two different states, were thoroughly reviewed by state court judges who found no reason why Woody and his wife shouldn\u2019t be allowed to adopt. The girls, now aged 15 and 13, are named Bechet (after jazz saxophonist/clarinetist Sidney Bechet) and Manzie (after jazz drummer Manzie Johnson). \n \n It took me little more than two years to complete my film, Woody Allen: A Documentary. I conducted hours of filmed interviews with Woody, who put forward no ground rules about questions I could ask, or topics to avoid. Although I shot some film on location with Woody in London and Cannes, most of our filming took place in New York City. On more than one occasion, when I was planning to interview Woody, I found I had to schedule around mornings when he\u2019d walk his kids to school, or attend parent-teacher conferences. The normalcy of his domestic life was somehow surprising to me. I\u2019ve not spent a lot of time with his kids, but I\u2019ve met them on a few occasions where I\u2019ve received the cursory \u201chello,\u201d as they went about their business doing girl stuff with their friends. The only parent-child tensions I\u2019ve been privy to are that his girls think their father\u2019s mean for not letting them have a dog, and that he\u2019s an idiot for not knowing how to work a computer. Lest anyone accuse me of being in Woody\u2019s pocket, I\u2019ll confess that I side with his kids on both counts. \n \n My more recent professional association with Woody took place last month, when I was asked to work on the Allen clip montage for the Golden Globes. The montage editor, Nicholas Goodman, and I wanted to include a brief moment from The Purple Rose of Cairo, in which Mia appeared. The producers were concerned about whether she would sign a release for the clip. (The Screen Actors Guild maintains very strict rules about obtaining authorization from any actor who appears in a clip excised for compilations.) I thought it unlikely that Mia would object, as I had obtained a signed release for my documentary, in which she granted permission for her appearance in many lengthy clips from several Allen films. At the time, I was extremely grateful for her cooperation, for without it, I would have had a 12-year gap in my film, and Mia would have been extremely conspicuous by her absence. I even took it as a possible sign that 20 years after the fact, perhaps the healing process had begun to take hold. As a further sign of good will, Mia agreed to the use of her \u201cPurple Rose\u201d clip in the Golden Globe montage. The producers of the show were grateful. Everyone agreed it would have been a shame not to acknowledge Mia\u2019s contribution to so many of Allen\u2019s best films. \n \n At the ceremony in Beverly Hills, actress Emma Stone, having just worked with Woody on his latest film Magic in the Moonlight, introduced the montage, followed by Diane Keaton\u2019s surrogate acceptance speech, which was typically sentimental, loopy, and very Keatonesque. Woody, who would have never stopped throwing up had he been there, was instead in New York at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre for the opening of Beautiful: The Carole King Musical, whose book was written by Woody\u2019s friend Doug McGrath. Woody had already told me that if the show let out early enough, he was hoping to get home in time to catch the last quarter of the football playoffs. \n \n Apparently, Mia and Ronan assigned more significance to the festivities than did Woody, seeing the televised occasion as a perfect opportunity to bring him down a few pegs. The first of Mia\u2019s tweets, issued as the Woody segment commenced, was restrained and kind of cute: \u201cTime to grab some icecream & switch over to #GIRLS.\u201d I smiled when I read it, and thought, \u201cWhy not? You already saw the montage when you approved the use of your clip.\u201d Her second tweet, referencing the recent Vanity Fair article, was nastier: \u201cA woman has publicly detailed Woody Allen\u2019s molestation of her at age 7. GoldenGlobe tribute showed contempt for her & all abuse survivors.\u201d \n \n This one puzzled me. I thought it was odd to say the Globe tribute showed contempt for abuse survivors when Mia willfully participated in the festivities by expressly agreeing to the use of her clip, when she had every opportunity to decline. She certainly wasn\u2019t pressured, and we had an alternative version of the montage (sans Mia) all ready to go in case she passed. It seemed Mia either wanted it both ways, or simply assumed no one would ever learn that she was complicit in the tribute. By the time I saw her third tweet, asking, \u201cIs he a pedophile?\u201d and linking to the Vanity Fair article, my most charitable thought was that this woman needs to get over herself. A more mischievous part of me wanted to repost her tweet, but swap out her link for one leading to an article about the recent 10-year jail sentence received by her brother, John Charles Villiers-Farrow, for multiple counts of child molestation\u2014a topic she\u2019s been unusually quiet about, considering her penchant for calling out alleged (let alone, convicted) molesters to whom she\u2019s exposed her children. \n \n I was actually somewhat impressed with Ronan Farrow\u2019s now-famous tweet from the summer of 2012: \u201cHappy father\u2019s day\u2014or as they call it in my family, happy brother-in-law\u2019s day.\u201d The target was fair game, and I remember thinking Ronan had inherited his father\u2019s wit\u2014before his actual paternity came into question. (A good sense of humor and the ability to think on his feet will serve him well on his own show on MSNBC.) But his tweet the night of the Globes was a bit more vicious: \u201cMissed the Woody Allen tribute\u2014did they put the part where a woman publicly confirmed he molested her at age 7 before or after Annie Hall?\u201d Brevity may be the soul of wit, if not nuanced accuracy. Had he stated that a woman publicly \u201calleged\u201d molestation, it probably wouldn\u2019t have triggered quite the reaction Ronan was looking for, just weeks before his show debuts. To remind readers that the woman is recalling memories from the age of seven, when a six-month investigation characterized her as being \u201cemotionally disturbed,\u201d and making statements that were likely \u201ccoached or influenced by her mother,\u201d takes a little more than 140 characters. \n \n I\u2019ve already said this, but it bears repeating: I know Dylan/Malone believes these events took place, and I know Ronan believes so too. I am not in a position to say they didn\u2019t, any more than all the people on the internet calling for Woody\u2019s head can say they did. The point is that accusations make headlines; retractions are buried on page twelve, and coerced accusations are as much a reality as coerced confessions. Since Woody literally pays no mind to this stuff, and he continues to work and have a happy home life, I would never suggest he\u2019s a victim in this case. The real victim has always been Malone. For me, however, the real questions are: who\u2019s doing the victimizing, and does pain really heal better in the public spotlight? I don\u2019t pretend to have answers for either question. \n \n Malone, who is now a writer and artist, and happily married to an information-technology specialist, had been living a seemingly quiet life out of the spotlight. Obviously, if she feels that an interview with Vanity Fair is a necessary part of her healing process, that\u2019s her right. I can only hope it brought her some closure, and I sincerely wish her all the happiness and peace she\u2019s been looking for. I can even clear up one tiny mystery for her, of which I have personal knowledge. In the Vanity Fair article, Malone says that while a senior in college, she received in the mail a stuffed, manila envelope from Woody, filled with old photos of the two of them. She didn\u2019t recognize the handwriting, but \u201c(the envelope) had a fake return name: Lehman.\u201d When I was working on my documentary, I\u2019d occasionally request material from Woody\u2019s office, which would be mailed to me by his assistant whose name would appear on the return address. During Malone\u2019s senior year in college, Woody had an assistant whose surname was Lehman. So there\u2019s one mystery solved. If only all the others were so easy. \n \n As to the overall reliability or objectivity of Vanity Fair, I can\u2019t really take a position. I do know that the publication was sued for libel in 2005 by director Roman Polanski who, in 1977, pled guilty to unlawful intercourse with a thirteen-year-old girl in Los Angeles that year. The magazine published an article stating that in 1969, Polanski was seen fondling and hitting on a young model at Elaine\u2019s restaurant in New York City on his way to the funeral of his late wife Sharon Tate, who had been brutally slain by the Manson family. One of the witnesses who testified on Polanski\u2019s behalf was Mia Farrow, who, I\u2019m told, remains friendly with the director to this day. I commend her for standing by her friend and going on record as a character witness. That\u2019s what friends do. In fact, her support of Polanski is so steadfast that when he won the Oscar for best director for his 2002 masterpiece, The Pianist, Mia never even suggested that the Motion Picture Academy showed contempt for all abuse survivors in so honoring him. But then again, those were the days before Twitter. \n \n Polanski won his libel suit against Vanity Fair. It was proven that the director wasn\u2019t even in New York on his way to his wife\u2019s funeral, which took place in Los Angeles. \n \n * * * * Editor's note: Subsequent to publishing the above piece, an open letter from Dylan Farrow appeared in Nicholas Kristof\u2019s column in the New York Times. When asked for comment, Weide sent this reply: \u201cThis continues to be a very sad story from every angle. I can only say I found nothing in Dylan\u2019s letter that hasn\u2019t previously been alleged in the two previous Vanity Fair articles, which I\u2019ve already addressed. I also see nothing that contradicts what I wrote for The Daily Beast. If I wrote it today, it would be exactly the same piece.

I see now that this was a vengeful way to pay him back for falling in love with Soon-Yi.\"Moses and Dylan, 28, both adopted by Allen and Farrow, and their brother Ronan, 26, were in the center of a 1993 custody battle in which both sides testified about Allen's affair with Farrow's adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn, whom Allen went on to marry in 1997. Farrow was awarded custody of the couple's three children. (In total, she has 14 kids from her marriages and solo adoptions.) Allen, 78, who was investigated but not charged with molestation, has for decades denied abusing Dylan, maintaining that Farrow, 69, coached Dylan, an accusation Farrow has always denied.\"Of course Woody did not molest my sister,\" says Moses, who is estranged from Farrow and many of his siblings and is close to Allen and Soon-Yi. \"She loved him and looked forward to seeing him when he would visit. She never hid from him until our mother succeeded in creating the atmosphere of fear and hate towards him. The day in question, there were six or seven of us in the house. We were all in public rooms and no one, not my father or sister, was off in any private spaces. My mother was conveniently out shopping. I don\u2019t know if my sister really believes she was molested or is trying to please her mother. Pleasing my mother was very powerful motivation because to be on her wrong side was horrible.\"Dylan insists that she is telling the truth.\"This is such a betrayal to me and my whole family,\" she tells PEOPLE in response to her brother's comments. \"My memories are the truth and they are mine and I will live with that for the rest of my life.\"\"My mother never coached me,\" Dylan says. \"She never planted false memories in my brain. My memories are mine. I remember them. She was distraught when I told her. When I came forward with my story she was hoping against hope that I had made it up. In one of the most heartbreaking conversations I have ever had, she sat me down and asked me if I was telling the truth. She said that Dad said he didn\u2019t do anything. and I said, 'He's lying.' \"Moses accuses Farrow of bullying him as well. \"Our mother has misled the public into believing it was a happy household of both biological and adopted children,\" he says. \"From an early age, my mother demanded obedience and I was often hit as a child. She went into unbridled rages if we angered her, which was intimidating at the very least and often horrifying, leaving us not knowing what she would do.\"\"I don't know where he gets this about getting beaten,\" counters Dylan. \"We were sent to our rooms sometimes.\"\"I will not see my family dragged down like this,\" she adds. \"I can't stay silent when my family needs me and I will not abandon them like Soon-Yi and Moses. My brother is dead to me. My mother is so brave and so courageous and taught me what it means to be strong and brave and tell the truth even in the face of these monstrous lies.\"Farrow, who declined to respond to Moses's accusations, Tweeted , \"I love my daughter. I will always protect her. A lot of ugliness is going to be aimed at me. But this is not about me, it's about her truth.\"Moses, a family therapist, says that his own life has been made better by spending time with Allen.\"I think my sister is missing a great deal in life in not reconnecting with her father, who had always adored her,\" he says. \"It\u2019s important that she assert her independence from our mother and not go through life with the false impression that she has been molested by my father. I am very happy I have come into my own power, separating from my mother, which has led to a positive reunion with my father.\"Allen's family says that the director is devastated by Dylan's letter.\"This is a horrible, horrible tragedy,\" Allen's sister Letty Aronson tells PEOPLE. \"He feels very badly for Dylan, that she has been so poisoned by her mother.\"Dylan, of course, feels very differently.\"I have a wonderful family,\" she says. \"We are brave and we are truthful and anyone who says anything otherwise does not know us.\"For much more on this story, including details of Dylan's and Woody Allen's lives now and an update on all of Farrow's children, look for this week's issue of People on newsstands Friday",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Moses Farrow, brother to Dylan Farrow and adopted son of Woody Allen, minces no words when it comes to his sister's allegations of sexual abuse at the hands of their father: \"Of course Woody did not molest my sister,\" Moses, 36, tells People. \"She loved him and looked forward to seeing him when he would visit. She never hid from him until our mother succeeded in creating the atmosphere of fear and hate towards him.\" He goes on to say that on the day in question, everyone who was in the house was in public, and neither Woody nor Dylan ever went off privately. \"I don\u2019t know if my sister really believes she was molested or is trying to please her mother,\" Moses says, claiming that Mia Farrow often hit him when he was a child and went into rages if she was not obeyed. Moses is now estranged from his mother and many of his siblings, but is close to Allen and his wife, Moses' adopted half-sister Soon-Yi Previn. Moses calls the whole fiasco Mia's \"vengeful way to pay [Allen] back for falling in love with Soon-Yi.\" In a piece written last month, Allen documentarian Robert B. Weide noted that while Moses, 15 at the time Dylan accused Allen, initially refused contact with his father, he recently told Weide he's now \"finally seeing the reality\" of what happened and used the term \"brainwashing.\" Dylan was quick to respond to her brother's public change of heart: She tells People, \"My brother is dead to me,\" adding, \"My mother never coached me. She never planted false memories in my brain. My memories are mine. I remember them.\" She also denies her mother hit anyone. Moses isn't the only one publicly doubting Dylan's story: Stephen King made waves Monday when he responded to a New Inquiry piece on the allegations by saying, \"Boy, I\u2019m stumped on that one. I don\u2019t like to think it\u2019s true, and there\u2019s an element of palpable bitchery there, but...\" Of course, Salon reports, he followed that up with a tweet: \"Have no opinion on the accusations; hope they're not true. Probably used the wrong word.\"",
    "generated_summary": "This is a basic principle: until it is proven otherwise, beyond a reasonable doubt, it\u2019s important to extend the presumption of innocence to Dylan Farrow, and presume that she is not guilty of the crime of lying about what Woody Allen did to her. The damnably difficult thing about all of this, of course, is that you can\u2019t presume that both are innocent at the same time. If you want to vigorously claim ignorance\u2013to assert that we can never know what happened, in that attic\u2013then you must ground that lack of knowledge in the presumption that what she has said doesn't count, and we cannot believe her story.",

(So far, Brooklyn has starred in Just Go With It with, and has both Battleship and What to Expect When You\u2019re Expecting hitting theaters in May.) \n \n Check out the Stooges trailer below. \n \n For more on Kate, click through the gallery! \n \n Also, look back on last year\u2019s cover girl below. ||||| There was a time, not long ago, when the surest path to modeling stardom was down the runway of a top designer\u2019s show, when it would have been unthinkable to find among the industry\u2019s top ranks a swimsuit girl whose main claims to fame were ad campaigns for Guess jeans and Beach Bunny Swimwear. \n \n But that was before social media altered the paths to fame. \n \n Unlike the many little-known beauties now on view at New York Fashion Week \u2014 women seldom identified by more than one name (Agata, Hanaa, Frida, Joan) \u2014 Kate Upton, just 19 and resembling a 1950s pinup, but with the legs of a W.N.B.A. point guard, has arrived on the scene as a largely self-created Internet phenomenon. \n \n It is not just that she has a respectable Twitter following (170,000 people at last count), or a YouTube video with over 3 million viewers, or marketing potential perhaps best measured by her rocketing from obscurity to No. 2 on a list of the world\u2019s 99 \u201ctop\u201d women compiled by AskMen.com, an online magazine with 15 million readers. (Sofia Vergara, of the ABC sitcom \u201cModern Family,\u201d is No. 1.) \n \n Less than a year after Ms. Upton, curvaceous and rambunctious, posted a video of herself at a Los Angeles Clippers game doing the Dougie, a dance popularized in a hip-hop tune by Cali Swag District, she finds herself in one of the most coveted positions in the modeling business. \n \n Joining an elite club of modeling powerhouses \u2014 brand names like Cheryl Tiegs, Tyra Banks and Heidi Klum \u2014 Ms. Upton was announced Monday night on David Letterman\u2019s show as the latest cover girl for Sports Illustrated\u2019s annual swimsuit issue, the circulation and advertising behemoth that has long been equally the dream book of adolescent males and the bane of feminists. \n \n In modeling, as in movies (see: \u201cChronicle,\u201d the film that hit No. 1 at the box office this month after relying on social media outlets like Twitter and YouTube for its marketing), music (the band Fun. and its inescapable viral hit \u201cWe Are Young\u201d) and most other cultural endeavors, it is increasingly clear that there is no longer a single path to success. \n \n \u201cWe all know that social media now creates its own reality,\u201d said Wayne Sterling, the publisher of Models.com, an industry Web site. \u201cIf you become a YouTube star among teenagers, you have even more recognizability than a TV star,\u201d he said. \u201cKate Upton is the perfect example of that.\u201d \n \n It was soon after the Dougie video went viral that a seasoned scout, David Cunningham, brought Ms. Upton to the attention of Ivan Bart of IMG Models, the company behind the multimillion-dollar careers of women like Gisele B\u00fcndchen, Ms. Klum and Kate Moss. \n \n \u201cWhen Kate first came in, everyone at the agency thought I was crazy,\u201d Mr. Bart, the \u201csuperagent\u201d who heads IMG Models, said of Ms. Upton. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t \u2018fashion\u2019 enough.\u201d \n \n Mr. Bart signed her anyway. And soon, to the surprise of some in the industry, Ms. Upton was being sought out for editorial sittings with people like Carine Roitfeld, the French fashion eminence known for her prophetic eye, and by Katie Grand, the influential stylist and editor of the fashion-forward British magazine Love. \n \n Wholesomely proportioned at 5 feet 11 inches with a 36-25-34 figure, Ms. Upton was a long way from the coolly robotic Eastern European beauty ideal that has dominated the catwalks for many seasons. \u201cKate is bigger than fashion,\u201d Mr. Bart said. \u201cShe\u2019s the Jayne Mansfield of the Internet.\u201d \n \n Though the catwalks of New York, Paris and Milan, traditionally a pathway to magazine covers and the lavish cosmetic and fragrance advertising campaigns that are the grail of every modeling hopeful, will continue to exert influence, it is increasingly difficult for the industry to ignore the world outside the Fashion Week tents, particularly the one that is virtual. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s not just enough to cast such-and-such a girl that opened Prada or Vuitton or whatever,\u201d said Trey Laird, the creative director of Laird & Partners, the advertising agency behind brands like Tommy Hilfiger, Juicy Couture and the Gap. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge help if a girl already has a platform and followers, and Kate Upton is a great example of that.\u201d \n \n Those dubious about Ms. Upton\u2019s crossover potential, or of any career driven toward the stony heart of fashion from the do-it-yourself fringes of the blogosphere, include Sophia Neophitou, editor of the English style bible 10 and a creative force behind the casting of the Victoria\u2019s Secret shows. \n \n \u201cWe would never use\u201d Ms. Upton for a Victoria\u2019s Secret show, Ms. Neophitou said by telephone last week from London. And, while Ms. Upton has, in fact, modeled on occasion for the company\u2019s catalog, her look, said Ms. Neophitou, is \u201ctoo obvious\u201d to be featured in what has become the most widely viewed runway show in the world.",

    "document": "It seemed like a stealthy, albeit disgusting, plan. \n \n A Wisconsin man thought he had come up with a way to creep under the skirts of women and take invasive and, perhaps, to him, titillating video, according to police in Madison, Wis. Unlike other \u201cupskirting\u201d instances, in which people have been caught using cellphones to record invasive photos of women, this 32-year-old thought he\u2019d try a different approach: a shoe camera. \n \n It\u2019s unclear what a \u201cshoe camera\u201d entails, but this unidentified man found a camera he could attach to his shoe and purchased it with the intention of taking videos under women\u2019s skirts, according to a Tuesday report from Madison Police Chief Michael Koval. \n \n But before capturing any footage, the man decided to test out the camera at home, Officer David Dexheimer told the Wisconsin State Journal. \n \n Just then, the device\u2019s battery blew up, injuring the man\u2019s foot and derailing his scheme, Koval wrote. \n \n He sought out medical treatment for minor burns, Dexheimer told the Wisconsin State Journal. As it turns out, the explosion hurt not only his foot but also his conscience. \n \n The man opened up about what happened to a clergyman, Dexheimer said. The clergyman suggested that the man turn himself in to the authorities and accompanied him to the police station. \n \n At about 5:30 p.m. Tuesday, police officers at a Madison station were contacted by the man, who admitted to his failed upskirting plans. The man was \u201ccounseled on his actions,\u201d Koval wrote, but ultimately released because he had not taken any illegal videos. \n \n It appears that the explosion, and the advice from the clergyman, worked out in the man\u2019s favor \u2014 for the time being. Authorities are continuing to investigate, Koval said. \n \n Upskirting, in its various forms, is not uncommon. Some reports in places like Washington have even found a spike in upskirting incidents in recent years, as phone cameras and other recording devices have become ubiquitous. Upskirting has been reported in Metro stations, Walmarts and grocery stores across the country. \n \n Upskirting is illegal in many places, including Wisconsin. Under a 2015 Wisconsin law, anyone who uses a device to record \u201cunder the outer clothing\u201d of a person without their consent can be found guilty of a felony. \n \n In other places, however, the law has been murkier. In Georgia, for example, a court in 2016 ruled that \u201cupskirting\u201d was legal in public places, such as a Publix grocery store. ||||| Close Get email notifications on Bill Novak | Wisconsin State Journal daily! \n \n Your notification has been saved. \n \n There was a problem saving your notification. \n \n Whenever Bill Novak | Wisconsin State Journal posts new content, you'll get an email delivered to your inbox with a link. \n \n Email notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items. ||||| Date of enactment: November 11, 2015 \n \n 2015 Assembly Bill 8 Date of publication*: November 12, 2015 Date of enactment:Date of publication*: \n \n 2015 WISCONSIN ACT 80 \n \n An Act to amend 301.45 (1p) (a), 938.355 (4m) (b) and 973.015 (1m) (a) 2.; and to create 942.08 (3) of the statutes; relating to: invading an individual's privacy by viewing under or through clothing and providing a penalty. \n \n The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows: \n \n 80,1 Section 1 . 301.45 (1p) (a) of the statutes is amended to read: 301.45 (1p) (a) of the statutes is amended to read: \n \n 301.45 (1p) (a) If a person is covered under sub.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 An attempt at \"upskirting,\" an exploding camera, and a guilty conscience led to \u2026 no arrest in Wisconsin, but the story is still attracting attention nationwide. The Wisconsin State Journal reports on the unidentified 32-year-old man at the center of it all, showing up Tuesday at a Madison police station to turn himself in for what he'd intended to do: take pictures up women's skirts by using a shoe camera. The Washington Post notes it's not exactly clear what a \"shoe camera\" is, but the man apparently was able to attach some kind of photographic device to his shoe and was testing it at home when the battery exploded, injuring his foot, Officer David Dexheimer tells the Journal. After getting treatment for the minor burns he received from the mini-blast, the man confessed his unsavory intentions to a clergyman, who encouraged him to turn himself in to police, Dexheimer says. There's a Wisconsin law on the books that outlaws anyone from purposely installing a device to photograph or otherwise record under a person's clothes without that person's consent, but the man in this case caught a lucky break: Per Madison Police Chief Mike Koval's daily \"significant calls\" blog, \"the subject was counseled on his actions and released from the scene as no illicit video had been taken.\" Koval notes there is an ongoing investigation, however.

    "document": "It\u2019s certainly rare to hear a comeback effort that not only reflects an artist\u2019s own best work, but stands alongside it in terms of quality, as The Next Day does. The fact that producer Tony Visconti has worked with Bowie since the Seventies undoubtedly helps cement the connection with his earlier work \u2013 there are constant frissons of recognition while listening to these songs, as if Bowie is deliberately mining memories. That notion is reinforced by the typically artful cover, which takes the original sleeve for the \u201cHeroes\u201d album and partly obscures its image with a simple sans-serif font title panel and, on the rear, a similarly blunt track listing, making the new album a sort of palimpsest of history. \n \n But if the design and sound suggest a link with the past, the songs \u2013 save for \u201cWhere Are We Now?\u201d \u2013 are all about today, as might be expected from such an astute barometer of societal and cultural mores as Bowie. Visconti has suggested in interviews that some songs, notably the title track, were prompted by the singer\u2019s recent immersion in books about medieval history; but whatever their origins, the songs seem to refract elements of the modern day, offering sometimes brutal commentaries on contemporary events. \n \n And there\u2019s a sleek, muscular modernity about the arrangements, mostly recorded with such Bowie stalwarts as guitarist Gerry Leonard, bassist Gail Anne Dorsey and drummer Zachary Alford, with telling contributions from rock guitarist Earl Slick and avant-rock soundscape guitarist David Torn. The result is an album that conveys, with apt anxiety or disgust, the fears and troubles of a world riven by conflict and distracted by superficial celebrity. \n \n Track-by-track verdicts \n \n The Next Day \n \n Supposedly written about some medieval tyrant, the title track employs a stalking funk-rock groove striated with angular, trebly guitars and bound to marching strings to depict a figure pursued by a baying mob who \u201ccan\u2019t get enough of that doomsday song\u201d and who can \u201cwork with Satan while they dance like saints\u201d. The trace of Johnny Rotten in Bowie\u2019s delivery reveals the underlying bitterness of a situation which, inevitably, doesn\u2019t end well: \u201cHere I am, not quite dying, my body left to rot in a hollow tree.\u201d \n \n Dirty Boys \n \n A slow, jerky trudge of brusque, visceral guitars and rudely honking baritone sax, this finds Bowie musing about living \u201csomething like Tobacco Road\u201d and heading off to \u201cFinchley Fair\u201d in search of excitement, however guttersnipe-low: \u201cWhen the die is cast and we have no choice, we will run with dirty boys.\u201d \n \n The Stars (Are Out Tonight) \n \n The second single from the album features another nervy, angst-ridden vocal, as Bowie reflects on the eternal status of celebrity, noting, \u201cThe stars are never sleeping/Dead ones and the living.\u201d The gently scudding groove is one of the album\u2019s most absorbing, laced with strings, clarinet and Visconti\u2019s descending recorder line lurking behind the guitars. Contains some of Bowie\u2019s best lines in ages, particularly his warning of the dangerous magnetism of stars who \u201cburn you with their radium smiles and trap you with their beautiful eyes\u201d. \n \n Love Is Lost \n \n \u201cOh what have you done, what have you done?\u201d wails an abject Bowie over a soundbed whose bitter guitar, organ and plodding bass lend a fatalistic slant to a broadside at someone whose possessions are new, \u201c...but your fear is as old as the world.\u201d \n \n Where Are We Now? \n \n The acclaimed single stands apart from the rest of The Next Day: rather than brusque and angry in tone, it\u2019s a piece of almost oceanic melancholy. An enervated reflection on Bowie\u2019s Berlin days, it\u2019s full of references to his favourite haunts, viewed through a veil of watery, reverbed guitars like misted eyes, while the subtle touches of autotuning give the voice a delicate fragility appropriate to the ruminations of \u201ca man lost in time... just walking the dead.\u201d \n \n Valentine\u2019s Day \n \n The earliest track recorded for The Next Day, this has nothing to do with 14 February, but rather offers a mocking depiction of a bitter nobody who may well have \u201cgone postal\u201d against the more popular kids at school, couched in one of the album\u2019s most engaging pop arrangements. \n \n If You Can See Me \n \n From one of its most appealing songs to its most antagonistic, a hurried bustle of noise featuring a piercing keyboard monotone at nerve-shredding pitch. Another song seemingly inspired by Bowie\u2019s recent fascination with medieval history, this bowls along pell-mell, a torrent of impressionistic lines and threats from an invader who \u201cwill take your lands...slaughter your beasts...I am the spirit Greed\u201d. \n \n I\u2019d Rather Be High \n \n Set to a jazzy shuffle bound with a sinuous guitar line, this finds one of the poor bloody infantry regretting the youthful wrong turn that led him to his embattled foxhole: \u201cI\u2019d rather be flying, I\u2019d rather be dead, than out of my head and training these guns on those men in the sand.\u201d \n \n Boss Of Me \n \n The honking baritone sax from \u201cDirty Boys\u201d reappears in bathetic-ironic mode to underscore the plight of a hapless lad stuck on the spike of feminism: Who\u2019d have ever dreamed,\u201d he marvels plaintively, \u201cthat a smalltown girl like you would be the boss of me?\u201d \n \n Dancing Out In Space \n \n David Torn\u2019s interweaving guitar whines lend a miasmic, psychedelic flavour to the prancing, Motown-style funk-rock groove of one of the album\u2019s hookiest, catchiest trifles, a celebration of dance: \u201cNo one here can beat you/Dancing out in space.\u201d An obvious future single. \n \n How Does The Grass Grow? \n \n A phrase apparently used to assist in bayonet practice \u2013 \u201cHow does the grass grow? Blood, blood, blood!\u201d \u2013 is given an absurdist makeover by the addition of the hook motif from The Shadows\u2019 \u201cApache\u201d, sung as a falsetto \u201cyah-yah-yah-yah\u201d. Weird doesn\u2019t quite cover it. \n \n (You Will) Set The World On Fire \n \n A terse guitar riff in the style of early Kinks carries this song about ambition and fame, sung as if by a manager flattering his client: \u201cI can hear the nation cry!\u201d Period references set it firmly in the Sixties, notably the claim that \u201cKennedy would kill for the lines that she\u2019s written/Van Ronk says to Bobby, \u2018She\u2019s the next real thing!\u2019\u201d Another obvious potential single. \n \n You Feel So Lonely You Could Die \n \n As the album cruises to its close, the tone becomes more melancholy with this melodramatic, epic evocation of someone\u2019s loneliness and suicidal depression. \u201cI can see you as a corpse, hanging from a beam... Oh, see if I care, Oh please make it soon,\u201d sings Bowie with exquisite, beautiful poise. \u201cOblivion shall own you, death alone shall love you.\u201d \n \n Heat \n \n The album closes with the Scott Walkeresque vocal portents and apocalyptic tone and imagery of \u201cHeat\u201d, in which acoustic guitar, strings and guitar noise track the protagonist\u2019s search for his own identity through intimations of guilt and shame, finally resolving into a duality that might stand as the motto for the album as a whole: \u201cI am a seer, but I am a liar.\u201d Which of course, is equivalent to saying \u201cI am a storyteller.\u201d \n \n 'The Next Day' is set for release on 11 March in standard and deluxe versions ||||| It is an enormous pleasure to report that the new David Bowie album is an absolute wonder: urgent, sharp-edged, bold, beautiful and baffling, an intellectually stimulating, emotionally charged, musically jagged, electric bolt through his own mythos and the mixed-up, celebrity-obsessed, war-torn world of the 21st century. \n \n Musically, it is stripped and to the point, painted in the primal colours of rock : hard drums, fluid bass, fizzing guitars, shaded by splashes of keyboard and dirty rasps of horns. The 14 songs are short and spiky, often contrasting that kind of patent Bowie one-note declarative drawl with sweet bursts of melodic escape that hit you like a sugar rush. Bowie\u2019s return from a decade\u2019s absence feels very present, although full of sneaky backward glances. \n \n Hints, references and echoes of the past abound. Touches of jangling Sixties pop lift the flying melody of I\u2019d Rather Be High, the poised soul of the Thin White Duke haunts the sax strut of Dirty Boys and Boss of Me, and epic Eighties Goth rears its imperious head amid the dramatic descending chords of Love Is Lost. \n \n You might detect the wonky sound-clashes of Berlin-era Bowie in the dissonant chords of Dancing Out In Space, albeit crossed with the dynamic grooves of Let\u2019s Dance, opening out to the drum\u2019n\u2019bass jazz fusion of Earthling on If You Can See Me. \n \n There\u2019s a surprising blast of the heavy rocking excess of Tin Machine on the power-chord stomp of (You Will Set) The World On Fire and even a welcome dash of Ziggy Stardust about the glam-rocking Valentine\u2019s Day, which spirals off towards the heavens with Earl Slick\u2019s guitar solo pursuing the elusive spirit of the late Mick Ronson. \n \n Yet The Next Day never feels like a museum piece, deftly filtering signature references through a lean, snappy New York rock distortion that is something quite new for Bowie. Discounting the failed experiment of Tin Machine, this is his rockiest album since the days of Aladdin Sane. \n \n The Next Day was produced secretly over two years with long-serving collaborator Tony Visconti and a small unit of session players familiar from late-period Bowie, including bassist Gail Ann Dorsey, drummer Zachary Alford and Irish ambient guitarist Gerry Leonard, with Bowie on keyboards. \n \n \n \n David Bowie - Where Are We Now? on MUZU.TV. \n \n \n \n The title track opens with a snare slam and see-saw guitar riff appropriated from Fashion but ramped up with a Sonic Youth attack. Imagistic lyrics conjure a fallen idol betrayed and punished by \u201cthe gormless and baying crowd\u201d who \u201ccan\u2019t get enough of that doomsday song\u201d. \u201cHere I am, not quite dying,\u201d chants Bowie, while his band punch and howl. \n \n Here he is, indeed. With its dense, oblique imagery, \u201csoggy paper bodies\u201d and \u201cpurple-headed priest\u201d, it could (as producer Visconti has suggested) be about some obscure medieval tyrant, but it could equally be a comment on the fickleness and dangers of the fame from which Bowie retreated. \u201cAt first they give you everything that you want,\u201d Bowie snaps, \u201cthen they take back everything that you need.\u201d \n \n Stars are a repeated, ambiguous motif, sometimes appearing as celestial bodies, sometimes in the back of stretch limos with tinted windows. \n \n \u201cBrigitte, Jack, Kate and Brad\u201d have a playful cameo on The Stars (Are Out Tonight), in which Bowie recasts celebrities as tragic minor gods of a secular age, \u201csexless and unaroused\u201d. With his cut-and-paste methodology, Bowie is never easy to interpret, but his new album bubbles and fizzes with lyrical energy, panning out from intensely personal close-ups to horrified widescreen shots of a chaotic world. \n \n \n \n David Bowie - The Stars (Are Out Tonight) on MUZU.TV. Warning: contains scenes of nudity \n \n On the extraordinary How Does The Grass Grow he contemplates ethnic genocide with a nightmarish despair made all the more disorienting by the off-kilter exuberance of a \u201cla la la\u201d chorus appropriated from The Shadows\u2019 Apache. \n \n The album\u2019s epic climax, You Feel So Lonely You Could Die, is fantastic, a lush companion piece to Ziggy\u2019s Rock\u2019n\u2019roll Suicide that drips vitriol in place of compassion (\u201cOblivion shall own you / Death alone shall love you\u201d), the warmth of the setting contrasting with the cold rage of the sentiment. \n \n It feels highly personal but lends itself to political interpretation, an attack on shadowy figures who engineer conflict, the power behind the power. But why does Bowie shift gear at the end to ride out on the stately, resonant drum pattern of Ziggy\u2019s Five Years? \n \n What can it all mean? Who knows? I\u2019m still scratching my head over an album cover that looks as if he just stuck a Post-it note on Heroes. You don\u2019t come to Bowie for easy answers, and The Next Day is both immediately rewarding and mystifyingly opaque. It closes on the ominous, despairing, jazzily introspective Heat, with the tremulous refrain \u201cAnd I tell myself, I don\u2019t know who I am.\u201d \n \n Bowie provides his own tantalising answer to the ultimate question of his chameleonic identity by signing off from the most compelling comeback in rock history with \u201cI am a seer\u2026 but I am a liar.\u201d \n \n Welcome back, David. \n \n The Next Day is released on Sony on March 11 \n \n Follow Telegraph Music on Twitter ||||| When David Bowie chose to break a decade's silence by releasing a single, Where Are We Now?, on his 66th birthday, dissenting voices were hard to find amid the clamour made by people eager to welcome him back. Some argued that the clamour was part of the problem: it drowned out the music, which perhaps wasn't worthy of the noisy excitement it had caused. The reason people were so thrilled Bowie was back, they suggested, was founded in the music he made in the 1970s, a decade when almost every new album he released was an astonishingly sure-footed leap forward into uncharted territory. But Where Are We Now? was no Heroes or Sound and Vision. Rather, it was a charming, fragile ballad. Indeed, it was not unlike the stuff he had been knocking out immediately before his retirement, when \u2013 presumably burned by the mixed response to his spirited 1990s attempts to seize the zeitgeist or dabble in the avant garde in the way he'd done so effortlessly two decades previously \u2013 Bowie settled on a more straightforward and comfortable kind of classicism. Had Where Are We Now? been released in 2004, they suggested, its reception would have been far more muted. People were welcoming back an exhilarating, distant memory of Bowie, rather than the reality. \n \n They had a point, but Where Are We Now? still carried with it some intriguing possibilities for the subsequent album. The song found Bowie drifting nostalgically around his former adopted hometown, Berlin, suggesting that The Next Day might be that rarest of things, an autobiographical work from an artist whose nakedly autobiographical songs can be numbered on the fingers of one hand. Such speculation was bolstered by the self-referential artwork of both the single and album: the former offering an inverted photo of a skeletal Bowie onstage in 1974, the latter featuring the cover of 1977's Heroes with the title redacted and a white square covering the famous image of the singer in a pose modelled on a painting by Erich Heckel. Perhaps, came the excited suggestion, Bowie had spent the past decade ruminating on his past and was now issuing an album in lieu of a memoir. \n \n Perhaps not. There are certainly a smattering of knowing sonic references to Bowie's past works. If You Can See Me features the eerie sped-up vocal effect found on 1970's After All and the climax of Hunky Dory's The Bewlay Brothers, while You Feel So Lonely You Could Die ends with a reprise of the drum beat that introduced Five Years, the opening track of The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. And there are moments when you wonder whether some of the characters in The Next Day's songs aren't founded in personal experience: certainly, the protagonist of Love Is Lost \u2013 appointed \"the voice of youth\", marooned abroad, cosseted by luxury but fearful and paranoid, \"thinking like mad\" \u2013 feels remarkably like a pen portrait of the poor, cocaine-ravaged soul in that inverted photo. But elsewhere The Next Day offers what you might call an index of Bowiean obsessions. \n \n Reading this on mobile? Click here to view video \n \n In the first 10 minutes alone, you get the terror of life in a dystopian dictatorship teetering on the brink of apocalypse; a feral gang of vaguely homoerotic juvenile delinquents smashing things up; the numbing isolation of stardom and the suggestion that stars themselves may actually be some kind of alien lifeforms \"soaking up our primitive world\". The mutual respect between Bowie and Scott Walker is well-documented \u2013 an effusive 50th birthday tribute from the elusive former Scott Engel famously reduced Bowie to tears live on Radio 1 \u2013 and it's Walker's latterday work that much of The Next Day resembles, at least in that the lyrics are so dense and allusive you occasionally feel in need of a set of York Notes to get through them. \n \n The present writer spent an alternately illuminating and rather trying few hours attempting to unpick the lyrics of I'd Rather Be High. Perhaps the mention of \"Clare and Lady Manners\" drinking and gossiping about politics during wartime was a reference to The Coterie, the 1910s' equivalent of the subsequent decade's bright young things \u2013 its male membership ultimately decimated in the trenches \u2013 in which Lady Diana Manners played a leading role. Or perhaps it was a reference to Officers and Gentlemen, the second novel in Evelyn Waugh's Sword of Honour trilogy, in which a character based on Lady Diana Cooper (nee Manners) attempts to pull strings for Ivor Clare, a character facing desertion charges. That seems more likely \u2013 amid the subsequent lyrical references to the futility of conflict, there's a mention of Egypt, where Officers and Gentlemen is partially set \u2013 in which case, the song's overall message might be summarised as: Waugh \u2013 huh! \u2013 what is it good for? But what does Officers and Gentlemen \u2013 or, for that matter, The Coterie \u2013 have to do with the opening line's reference to Vladimir Nabokov's life in 1920s and 30s Berlin? Pausing only to wonder whether there's a certain cultural richness here that you just don't find in, say, the oeuvre of the Vaccines, or whether Bowie has earned himself the exalted position where one takes for cultural richness the kind of thing you'd ordinarily dismiss as agonising pretention \u2013 and to note that either is deeply impressive \u2013 the present writer gave up and decided to just enjoy the music. \n \n This, it has to be said, is a relative doddle. Producer Tony Visconti has suggested that The Next Day is of a piece with 1979's Lodger and, as on that record, Bowie spends a lot of The Next Day experimenting with his vocal delivery, offering, among other things, a peculiar nasal drone on the title track and a doomy, tortured lowing that recalls Walker \u2013 him again \u2013 on the closing Heat. The dense web of screaming feedback that ends Where Does the Grass Grow? recalls the climax of Boys Keep Swinging, while the fantastic If You Can See Me has some of the relentless propulsion of Move On, although it's perhaps worth noting that the latter track was about the joyous freedom of travel, while the characters here are unable to escape the shadowy forces controlling their lives however far they run: \"if you can see me, I can see you,\" reiterates the chorus, Big Brother-ishly. That aside, the comparison with Lodger might be pitching it a bit high. It's perhaps the least well-regarded album of original material Bowie released in the 70s, but that tells you more about the astonishing quality of the records that preceded it than it does Lodger itself. If there are some intriguing musical decisions on The Next Day \u2013 the honking baritone sax that gives the feral gang of Dirty Boys a curiously lurching, ungainly gait; the vocal rendering of the Shadows' Apache that constitutes Where Does the Grass Grow?'s hook, the ominous, fretless-bass-decorated shudder of Heat \u2013 there's none of Lodger's unfettered experimentalism, nothing as authentically bizarre as Yassassin or African Night Flight. \n \n What The Next Day has that perhaps Lodger didn't is something more prosaic. Whatever else he's been doing, clearly at least some of the last decade has been spent carefully crafting inarguable tunes. Its melody shifting from weary sigh to frantic angst, I'd Rather Be High is utterly beautiful; The Stars (Are Out Tonight) supports its Brad-Pitt-is-an-alien thesis with a fantastic chorus, all the more potent for the fact that it takes an age to arrive; Valentine's Day is so deceptively sweet that the bleakness of its subject matter \u2013 another tyrant, bent on crushing the world beneath his heels \u2013 doesn't initially register. \n \n Despite the lyrical density, The Next Day's success rests on simple pleasures, not a phrase you'd ever use to describe Lodger or Station to Station. You could argue that means the naysayers still have a point. For all the pointers it offers in that direction, The Next Day isn't the equal of Bowie's 70s work: but then, the man himself might reasonably argue, what is? Perhaps it's destined to be remembered more for the unexpected manner in which it was announced than its contents. That doesn't seem a fair fate for an album that's thought-provoking, strange and filled with great songs. Listening to The Next Day makes you hope it's not a one-off, that his return continues apace: no mean feat, given that listening to a new album by most of his peers makes you wish they'd stick to playing the greatest hits. \n \n \u2022 The Next Day is released on 11 March",

    "document": "Once they sense danger, fruit flies can pitch their bodies like a fighter jet during flight, rolling almost upside down in order to shift momentum and speed to avoid a oncoming threat, new research shows. \n \n \u201cWe discovered that fruit flies alter course in less than one one-hundredth of a second, 50 times faster than we blink our eyes, which is faster than we ever imagined.\u201d Michael Dickinson, UW professor of biology and co-author of the paper about these findings, said in a news release. \n \n In his lab, Dickinson and other researchers have found that evasive maneuvers performed by fruit flies, also known as Drosophila hydei, are very similar to those of a fighter jet. His research will be published in the April 11 issue of Science. \n \n Escape Maneuver in a Flying Fly from Michael Dickinson on Vimeo. \n \n More like a plane than a boat \n \n \u201cOne of the fastest things a fruit fly does is take information from its eyes and react accordingly,\u201d Dickinson said. \n \n Previous research suggested that flies would turn like a boat would, Dickinson said, but this new research has shown that they can pitch their body and perform banked turns much like a plane would. \n \n \u201cThey do this with remarkably subtle changes in wing movement,\u201d Dickinson told us. \n \n Florian Muijres, lead author of the paper and postdoctoral researcher, said that it\u2019s both the speed and accuracy of the flies that they have found impressive. \n \n \u201cWhat we have found is that these flies are fast and accurate in their response,\u201d Muijres said. \n \n According to Muijres, the flies can roll almost completely upside down while flying thanks to the incredible speed at which they flap their wings. \n \n \u201cThese flies normally flap their wings 200 times a second and, in almost a single wing beat, the animal can reorient its body to generate a force away from the threatening stimulus and then continues to accelerate,\u201d Muijres said in the UW release. \n \n The fly\u2019s brain may be small, but it\u2019s very dense with neurons. Muijres said a fly\u2019s brain is actually more dense than a human brain. The mystery of how these little creatures are able to perform such amazing feats is still pushing the researchers at UW forward with their research. \n \n \u201cWe have the input and the output and now we are looking at how the input translates into the output,\u201d Muijres said. \n \n Using tech to slow down time \n \n UW researchers used three high speed cameras to accurately capture the flies\u2019 movements in a 20-by-20 centimeter flight arena. They used an expanding shadow effect to make the fly take evasive action, and the cameras recorded the action at 7,500 frames per second. \n \n Escape Maneuver Fly SetupNrobofly from Michael Dickinson on Vimeo. \n \n Because the camera shutters were opening and closing every one thirty-thousandth of a second, they need to light the flight arena so the cameras would be able to get the footage. Dickinson said they used infra-red light in order to light the space for the cameras without blinding the flies in the process. \n \n \u201cWhen the flies would go through the focus of all three cameras is when we would start recording,\u201d Dickinson said. \n \n Once the measurements and video were recorded, the scientists were able to replicate the fly\u2019s movement on a robot fly model. \n \n \u201cWe are able to take the measurements and replay them on the robot and directly measure the forces the wings were generating,\u201d Dickinson said. \n \n Amazing brains \n \n Dickinson said a fruit fly\u2019s brain performs very complicated calculations in a split second, an amazing level of calculation for something so small. \n \n \u201cHow can such a small brain generate so many remarkable behaviors? A fly with a brain the size of a salt grain has the behavioral repertoire nearly as complex as a much larger animal such as a mouse. That\u2019s a super interesting problem from an engineering perspective,\u201d Dickinson said in a news release. \n \n Check out some more videos of the fruit fly in action: \n \n Escape Maneuver FlyModel from Michael Dickinson on Vimeo. \n \n Escape Maneuver Fly Topview from Michael Dickinson on Vimeo. \n \n Escape Maneuver in Fly #2 from Michael Dickinson on Vimeo. \n \n Break out your 3D glasses for this one: \n \n Escape Maneuver FlyModel 3D from Michael Dickinson on Vimeo. ||||| Fruit flies could make some talented fighter pilots. Scientists who had the insects wing it through two laser beams watched the bugs make hairpin turns at blazing fast speeds, by banking in the same way that fighter jet planes do. The findings, published in the journal Science, shed light on these tiny critters\u2019 remarkable ability to evade predators (and fly swatters). \n \n [Updated at 5:15 p.m. PDT April 10: Tracking how these insects fly in response to a threat should help researchers understand the fruit fly's inner life, said Cornell University physicist Jane Wang, who was not involved in the research. \n \n \"The insects turn because they have some internal control circuitry, just like a pilot [who's] turning a plane,\" Wang said. \"And by looking how the insects turn, we might be able to say what the 'pilot' is thinking.\"] \n \n When trying to escape from a threat, the Drosophila hydei flies turn at a speed that\u2019s five times faster than their normal turning speed, according to researchers from the University of Washington. Instead of turning right or left on the \"yaw\" axis, like a boat in the water, the flies execute banked turns, by rolling and pitching their bodies at the same time, which supercharges their turns. They can execute one of these within less than one hundredth of a second after seeing a threat, the scientists said. That\u2019s 50 times faster than the blink of an eye. \n \n \u201cA lot of other people working in the field \u2026 would not have predicted the fly could rotate itself so quickly,\u201d said study coauthor Michael Dickinson, a neurobiologist at the University of Washington in Seattle. \n \n Dickinson and his colleagues captured 3,566 wing beats involved in 92 separate fruit fly escapes, which was no easy task. To capture such infinitesimally tiny movements, the scientists had to use high-speed cameras that took 7,500 frames per second -- that\u2019s nearly 40 frames for each wing beat. They also needed flood the flight area with light to capture the motions in high detail -- but all that light would blind the flies, which wouldn\u2019t be able to maneuver. \n \n Instead, they had to use infrared light, whose wavelength is too long for human or fly eyes to pick up on. All the circuitry in those lights generated so much heat that the scientists had to run an air conditioner in the laboratory, forcing the researchers to dress warmly in already chilly Seattle weather. \n \n There were, Dickinson said, \u201ca whole lot of wool hats worn in the lab.\u201d \n \n The scientists watched the flies fly through two crossing laser beams, causing their own shadow to loom large like an impending threat. In response, the flies quickly executed their escape maneuvers, which the scientists were able to capture on camera. \n \n The videos showed that the flies could roll to one side by 90 degrees or even more as they made these turns, almost bringing them upside down. And they could make these turns in less than two wing beats -- which is pretty remarkable, given that they typically flap their wings at 200 times per second, the scientists said. \n \n \u201cSo it\u2019d kind of be like a jet fighter pilot with a stick in his or her hand, only had to make a little bit of tiny change in the stick and pshooo, the plane goes off,\u201d Dickinson said. \u201cSo we\u2019re very interested in how the brain can control motion on such a fine scale.\u201d \n \n With all this high quality data, the scientists were able to pull out mathematical rules that governed the flies\u2019 decisions on how to make a banked turn, and they then programmed them into a robotic fly that they tested in flowing mineral oil. (Because the robot was much bigger than the flies, the scientists had to adjust the viscosity of the fluid they were \"flying\" through so the physics would stay about the same, the scientists said.) \n \n The next step, Dickinson said, is to understand the complex neural circuitry linked to the flight muscles that makes these daring maneuvers possible. \n \n ALSO: \n \n Hallelujah!

This meant that the iTunes retail price of the album automatically increased from \u00a34.99 to \u00a37.99. \n \n Houston's The Ultimate Collection, originally released in 1997, was the second top-selling album on iTunes on Monday morning.

    "document": "In Mr. Avery's home county, Manitowoc, where he was convicted in 1985, his release prompted apologies, even from the sexual assault victim, and a welcoming home for Mr. Avery. Elsewhere, the case became Wisconsin's most noted exoneration, leading to an \"Avery task force,\" which drew up a package of law enforcement changes known as the Avery Bill, adopted by state lawmakers just weeks ago. \n \n Mr. Avery, meanwhile, became a spokesman for how a system could harm an innocent man, being asked to appear on panels about wrongful conviction, to testify before the State Legislature and to be toured around the Capitol by at least one lawmaker who described him as a hero. \n \n But last week, back in rural Manitowoc County, back at his family's auto salvage yard, back at the trailer he had moved home to, Mr. Avery, 43, was accused once more. This time, he was charged in the death of Teresa Halbach, a 25-year-old photographer who vanished on Oct. 31 after being assigned to take pictures for Auto Trader magazine at Avery's Auto Salvage. \n \n After her family searched for Ms. Halbach for days, investigators said they found bones and teeth in the salvage yard, along with her car. In the car, they found blood from Mr. Avery and Ms. Halbach, they said. They also found her car key in the bedroom of his trailer, they said, and, using the very technology that led to Mr. Avery's release two years earlier, they said they identified Mr. Avery's DNA on the key. \n \n \"This case has blown us away,\" Stephen M. Glynn, a Milwaukee lawyer who has represented Mr. Avery in a $36 million civil lawsuit against the former prosecutor and former sheriff in the original sexual assault case, said of the new charges against Mr. Avery. \"I haven't taken that hard a punch in a long, long time.\" \n \n \"This lets down so many people,\" Mr. Glynn went on. \"This case became something that could have had an enormously positive effect on the criminal justice system in this state, but now that's up in the air.\" \n \n Around the nation, DNA testing has led to the exonerations of 163 people since 1989, including Mr. Avery, said Maddy deLone, executive director of the Innocence Project in New York, where Barry C. Scheck and Peter J. Neufeld were pioneers in the movement. Only one of those exonerated is known to have been convicted of a serious crime since being freed, Ms. deLone said. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Like leaders in similar groups, Ms. deLone said she had recently heard about Mr. Avery's case and had talked to colleagues about it. \"While this is a horrible, horrible crime,\" she said, \"we really don't think that it will have an effect on these efforts or on our responsibilities to vindicate innocent people.\" \n \n At the Wisconsin Innocence Project, leaders said the new accusations against Mr. Avery should not now be linked to his earlier wrongful arrest and release. Keith Findley, co-founder of the Wisconsin group, which describes Mr. Avery's case in its brochure, said the group's intent was not just to release the innocent but to find truth, and properly punish those truly responsible for crimes. \n \n \"This is a very emotional time and a very emotional event,\" Mr. Findley said. \"But this should not affect what we do.\" \n \n Still, for advocates accustomed to being praised as fighting on behalf of the falsely accused, the backlash here has been unavoidable. On talk radio and on Internet Web logs, critics have said that without the Wisconsin Innocence Project's efforts, one young woman might still be alive. Some said Mr. Avery's criminal record revealed telling signs of violence -- with convictions, for example, for burglary and cruelty to animals -- long before his 1985 sexual assault conviction. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She identified Mr. Avery as the man who had attacked her as she jogged on a beach. She had seen his face just 8 to 10 inches from her own, she said, and had noted his height, his broad hands with stubby fingers, his hair. The first thing that had raced through her mind in the attack, she told the jury, was that she needed to \"get a look at this guy.\" \n \n Years after the jury found Mr. Avery guilty, his lawyers pressed to have new DNA testing done on pubic hair found on the victim after the attack. The tests revealed not only that the hair did not belong to Mr. Avery, but found that it matched another man, who had lived in the area and who had since been sent to prison for a sexual assault. The case was held up as a perfect example of how eyewitness testimony, even the best intentioned, could simply be wrong. \n \n Even before the sexual assault conviction, Fred Hazlewood, the judge, now retired, who presided over Mr. Avery's case, said Mr. Avery's criminal record showed that he \"had a real potential\" for violence. \"But he served his time,\" Judge Hazlewood said, \"and you can't convict someone for what he might do.\" \n \n Family members said last week that they were certain Mr. Avery was not guilty of the new charges of first-degree intentional homicide and mutilating a corpse. The authorities were wrong before, Mr. Avery's father, Al, said, and they are wrong again. The evidence, Al Avery said, was planted. \n \n When Steven Avery finally got out of prison, his father said, he had lost his wife and family and found himself living in a tiny ice shanty once meant for winter fishing. Just surviving after so many years in prison was hard enough, Al Avery said. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n \"Now it's starting all over again,\" Mr. Avery's father said as he looked around the salvage yard that law officers had searched for days. \n \n Mr. Avery's mother, Dolores, said she could see the way people were looking at her, again, in the grocery store and on the streets here near Lake Michigan. \n \n \"He's innocent,\" Ms. Avery said. \"I know it in my heart.\" \n \n Soon, she said, she plans to call the Wisconsin Innocence Project, the lawyers who helped her son once before. \n \n \"There are 36 million reasons why they should be doing this to him,\" Mr. Avery's brother, Chuck, said, referring to the award his brother was seeking in his lawsuit. \n \n The future of that suit now appears in question. Depositions have been postponed. Mr. Glynn said that he still believed that his client had a strong case, but he acknowledged that the case had grown complicated. What will potential jurors think now? \n \n The arrest has changed other plans, too. Lawmakers who had pushed to have the state pay Mr. Avery more than $420,000 for his wrongful arrest have grown quiet. And the bill of changes -- to the way the police draw up eyewitness identification procedures, conduct interrogations and hold onto DNA evidence -- is no longer called the Avery Bill. \n \n \"The legislation is very important and very sound for our justice system as a whole,\" said Representative Mark Gundrum, a Republican who helped organize what was then called the \"Avery task force.\" \n \n \"But this does detract a little bit,\" Mr. Gundrum said. \"Obviously, we're not talking about Steven Avery anymore, not highlighting his conviction.\" \n \n And plans for a \"grand, glorious\" signing ceremony for what is now simply called the \"criminal justice reforms\" package, he said, seem remote. ||||| \u201cWe made our judgment, and the trial came to an end, and locally most people were in support of that,\u201d Mr. Ring said. \u201cNow it\u2019s back \u2014 by no choosing or no doing of anyone in this community.\u201d \n \n \u201cSo that\u2019s the first point of injustice,\u201d he added. \u201cThat we have to live through it again.\u201d \n \n In downtown Manitowoc, the county seat, the talkative, curious people I had come upon a decade earlier were no longer surprised \u2014 or the least bit pleased \u2014 to see yet another reporter. Many avoided any talk about \u201cMaking a Murderer,\u201d or simply spotted my notebook and walked away. The mayor declined to be interviewed. Business owners refused to discuss it: One said she had read online about a call for a protest in the town, and she was worried about safety. \n \n \u201cLook, we lived this whole thing like a juror,\u201d Suszanne Fox, who lives not far from here, told me as she ate a burger at the Fat Seagull. \u201cHe was guilty as sin.\u201d \n \n Many viewers of \u201cMaking a Murderer\u201d do not agree. Hundreds of thousands of people signed petitions asking President Obama to pardon Mr. Avery and Mr. Dassey, to which the White House has responded that the president cannot issue pardons in state cases. And Gov. Scott Walker has long pledged to issue no pardons while in office. \n \n The series left viewers with unrelenting questions: Did Mr. Avery\u2019s civil lawsuit for his wrongful sexual assault conviction motivate the Manitowoc County authorities to plant evidence against him in the second case, for murder? How was it that an old sample of Mr. Avery\u2019s blood, which was found in the victim\u2019s car, appeared to be tampered with while in the care of the authorities? Should Mr. Dassey, at his young age and with a limited intellect, have been questioned alone by investigators? Was his appointed lawyer working against his cause?",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Ten years before Making a Murderer fans started debating Steven Avery's case at just about every water cooler in the country, Monica Davey was just another reporter covering Avery's arrest on suspicion of the 2005 murder of Teresa Halbach in Manitowoc, Wis. The news came just as Avery was pursuing a $36 million civil lawsuit against a former prosecutor and sheriff, having recently been acquitted of a sexual assault for which he spent 18 years in prison. \"There are 36 million reasons why they should be doing this to him,\" Davey quoted Avery's brother as saying in a 2005 New York Times article. It caught the eye of two graduate student filmmakers, who would spend the next decade creating Making a Murderer. The series has forced Manitowoc to relive its darkest history and has left the county transformed, Davey writes at the Times following a return visit. While the county tourism office used to field calls about jogging paths and beaches, callers now question why the office would want to draw visitors to such a town. The local police and sheriff's departments, city hall, and even the Manitowoc County Historical Society are forced to listen to \"yelling, cussing, and swearing,\" says an official.

They hope her story will help end bullying. \n \n Children in an east Fort Collins neighborhood spent their Sunday evening holding a candlelight vigil and balloon launch in memory of classmate Ariana Cordova. The 11-year-old Lincoln Middle School student committed suicide last week. \n \n \u201cShe started being bullied when she was in second grade,\u201d her older sister Isabella Cordova said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until she came home with a broken arm that we had to figure out what happened.\u201d \n \n The girl\u2019s family said she showed signs of bullying and depression in the past. She was put through counseling and programs. Her sister said Ariana was not showing any signs of suicide before her death. \n \n \u201cThere are people on her bus that said she was counting down days but she never let any of us know. She acted like everything was fine,\u201d Isabella said. \n \n Cordova is not the only one. A second Fort Collins middle school student also took his own life during the weekend. The11-year-old Blevins Middle School student died Saturday night. His family has asked to keep his identity private. \n \n The two deaths are raising new questions about the way schools handle bullying. \n \n Cordova\u2019s family said Lincoln Middle School was very good at handling situations where Ariana did not feel comfortable, including allowing her to take a course online. Isabella said more still needs to be done though. \n \n \u201cI feel like it\u2019s really bad, but it kind of goes unnoticed because there are all these signs and slogans saying no bullying, this is a no bully school, but overall nothing has changed.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 These are troubling times for parents in Fort Collins, Colo., where two 11-year-old children took their own lives within days of each other. The suicide of a girl in sixth grade at Lincoln Middle School last Monday was followed by the Saturday night suicide of a boy who attended Blevins Middle School. Both schools are in the Poudre School District, and authorities are investigating whether the two deaths are linked, reports the Coloradoan. The girl's family says she suffered from bullying and depression, but one of the boy's friends tells the Coloradoan that he was a well-liked prankster; the classmate doesn't believe the boy was bullied. A police spokeswoman tells the Coloradoan that they have \"not received any information that bullying was a contributing factor in either incident.\" But the girl's older sister tells KDVR that the 11-year-old had been bullied since the second grade and the family didn't discover it until she came home with a broken arm. She says the family wants the death to bring about changes in how schools deal with bullying\u2014and to send the message to bullied children that they should always ask for help. \"If they're not going to listen to me, then imagine my little sister dancing in the sky wherever she is looking down on you saying that it's going to be OK. You can make it through this,\" she says. The Denver Post reports that Larimer County has logged 77 suicides year-to-date, including these two and one more of a child under age 18. The year prior, there were two under-18 suicides in the county. (Read about how a mother survived her son's high-profile suicide.)",
