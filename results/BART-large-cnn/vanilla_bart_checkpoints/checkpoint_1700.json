Two students in the hallway immediately detained the intruder until police arrived. \n \n Students in the class itself were slow to react, because the course in session was on law and literature, and they were in the middle of a unit about vigilante justice, so the students assumed that the arrest was part of the class. \n \n Cowen refused medical treatment, and tweeted the following shortly after the attack: \n \n Back to work!

    "document": "Mayor Rahm Emanuel on Monday won praise from some representatives of Chicago's immigrant community for going to court to block President Donald Trump's Department of Justice from withholding some police grant funding from so-called sanctuary cities. \n \n Some of those same activists, though, contend Emanuel should do even more to prevent police from helping federal officials deport Chicago immigrants who entered the country without the required legal documentation. The mayor also caught more flak from U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who in stepping up his rhetoric said \"no amount of federal taxpayer dollars will help a city that refuses to help its own residents.\" \n \n The wide array of views coming from Emanuel's City Hall, the White House and immigrant protection groups is a sign of the complex debate the mayor has entered by filing the lawsuit. It's all further complicated by differing views on whether sanctuary city status fosters or hinders crime \u2014 as reflected in Sessions' harsh words and the city's contention that the Trump \"administration's rhetoric is divorced from reality.\" \n \n Emanuel's lawsuit, filed Monday in federal court, asks a judge to block the Trump administration from enforcing three new conditions it included last week in applications for Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant money. The city uses the grant to help buy police cars, purchase other equipment and fund an anti-violence program. Those applications are due Sept. 5, and the city wants a court order before the deadline, said Corporation Counsel Ed Siskel, the city's top attorney. \n \n The new conditions outlined by Sessions' Justice Department: sharing immigration status information with federal officials enforcing deportation laws, providing unlimited police station access to those officials and giving them 48-hours notice of an arrested person's release in cases of potential immigration violations. \n \n City officials contend in the lawsuit that they do share immigration status information when they have it, but that's rare because the city doesn't keep it in the normal course of business. \n \n Providing unfettered station access would interfere with police department practices, delay release of people being held and violate the 10th Amendment by \"commandeering\" local government functions, the lawsuit states. And holding people for 48 hours without a warrant or probable cause that they have committed a crime would violate 4th Amendment search and seizure limitations, it adds. \n \n The suit also contends that the Justice Department has no authority to set conditions on the Byrne grant funding and is attempting to usurp the Congressional power of the purse. In short, the suit deems the conditions \"unlawful and unconstitutional.\" \n \n This year, the city was counting on receiving $3.2 million from the grants in question, a relatively miniscule portion of the city's overall $9.8 billion budget. \n \n \"We are at a time when every bit counts and every resource matters in this fight,\" Siskel said. \"In addition, we are bringing this legal challenge because the rhetoric and the threats from this administration, embodied in these new restrictions placed on public safety grant funds, are breeding a culture and a climate of fear within the communities in our city.\" \n \n City corporation counsel Ed Siskel talks at Dirksen Federal Building about the Emanuel administration lawsuit against the Donald Trump Justice Department about sanctuary city rules. Aug. 7, 2017 (John Byrne / Chicago Tribune) City corporation counsel Ed Siskel talks at Dirksen Federal Building about the Emanuel administration lawsuit against the Donald Trump Justice Department about sanctuary city rules. Aug. 7, 2017 (John Byrne / Chicago Tribune) SEE MORE VIDEOS \n \n Plus, the fate of Chicago's grant application also would affect other local Illinois governments that include their funding requests in Chicago's application, according to the lawsuit. They are Cook County, Bellwood, Calumet City, Chicago Heights, Cicero, Dolton, Evanston, Harvey, Maywood, Riverdale and Skokie. \n \n And the outcome of the suit could have ramifications for far-flung local and state governments with sanctuary laws on the books. They include New York, Philadelphia, Miami and the state of California. \n \n So it was no surprise that groups like Illinois Coalition for Immigration and Refugee Rights backed the mayor's move. \"We are all for defending Chicago's policy with respect to immigration,\" said Fred Tsao, the group's senior policy counsel. He also said \"the law is on the side of the city.\" \n \n Yet Tsao's group is part of a broader coalition that for months has been pushing Emanuel to remove four exemptions from the city's Welcoming City Ordinance, which sets its status as a sanctuary city. \n \n That ordinance bars police from providing federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials access to people in local custody. It also prohibits allowing ICE agents to use police facilities for interviews or investigations, and bars on-duty officers from responding to ICE questions or talking to ICE officials prior to a person's release from custody. \n \n But it does allow police to provide ICE officials access to immigrants suspected of entering the country illegally who are wanted on a criminal warrant, face criminal charges, have serious criminal convictions or are listed on Chicago gang databases. \n \n The American Civil Liberties Union maintains those exemptions, which could result in holding in custody someone not guilty of a recent crime, \"expose the city to liability for violations of the 4th Amendment,\" according to a letter the ACLU sent to the mayor and aldermen last month. \n \n Ald. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, 35th, has been pushing to get Chicago to join other cities that have eliminated similar exemptions, but the Emanuel administration so far has rebuffed his efforts, as recently as Friday by canceling a meeting on the issue. \n \n \"It's quite funny and hypocritical that at the same time as (Emanuel is) putting forward this lawsuit saying that we want to defend the Constitution, here the ACLU has said that our own sanctuary city policy is in violation of the supreme law of the land,\" said Ramirez-Rosa, who also stressed that he supports the lawsuit. \n \n Ramirez-Rosa's view runs counter to the image Emanuel has tried to portray on the issue in mostly Democratic Chicago, which has a significant Latino population that's become increasingly politically active. ||||| Attorney General Jeff Sessions' combative statement, which accused Chicago officials of adopting \"an official policy of protecting criminal aliens,\" is likely to be well received by President Donald Trump. | Andrew Harnik/AP Sessions blasts Rahm Emanuel over sanctuary suit \n \n Attorney General Jeff Sessions lashed out at Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel on Monday, delivering an unusually caustic reaction to a new lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's plans to crack down on so-called sanctuary cities. \n \n Emanuel announced the filing of the suit earlier in the day, complaining about a new Justice Department policy attempting to cut off grants to police departments that decline to cooperate with federal immigration officials. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Sessions' barbed reply argued that record numbers of murders in Chicago in recent years were attributable at least in part to Emanuel's decision to stick with a sanctuary policy that encourages police to ignore the immigration status of those they encounter. \n \n \"No amount of federal taxpayer dollars will help a city that refuses to help its own residents,\" Sessions said. \"To a degree perhaps unsurpassed by any other jurisdiction, the political leadership of Chicago has chosen deliberately and intentionally to adopt a policy that obstructs this country\u2019s lawful immigration system.\" \n \n The attorney general's combative statement, which accused Chicago officials of adopting \"an official policy of protecting criminal aliens,\" is likely to be well received by President Donald Trump. He has regularly blasted Chicago over crime, accusing it of being too lax in its response to the surge in violence there. \n \n Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson pushed back against the attorney general's portrayal. \n \n \"Undocumented immigrants are not driving violence in Chicago, and that's why I want our officers focused on community policing and not trying to be the immigration police,\" he said. \n \n He also said that \"the federal government's plans will hamper community policing and public safety.\" \n \n Sessions' statement comes amid what appears to be his concerted effort to curry favor with Trump after the president made a series of comments last month expressing dissatisfaction with Sessions and said he regretted picking him as attorney general. \n \n The most reliable politics newsletter.

No law obliges local governments to actively assist immigration officers or to notify them when illegal immigrants are released from jail. \n \n The Trump administration is trying to add such requirements to certain law-enforcement grants issued in the future, but Chicago's suit contends that Justice Department officials lack the authority to add anti-sanctuary-city requirements beyond a single provision barring grant recipients from policies that punish officers for contacting federal officials about a suspected undocumented immigrant. \n \n Other cities are considering similar lawsuits. Indeed, localities in California and Massachusetts have filed legal challenges to an early Trump executive order that many saw as threatening a broad crackdown on sanctuary cities. Emanuel and many law enforcement leaders argue that the policies benefit public safety by encouraging undocumented immigrants to cooperate and communicate with police. \n \n \u201cChicago is a welcoming city and always will be, and we will not be blackmailed by President Trump's Justice Department,\" Emanuel said as he announced the suit. \"Forcing us to choose between our values and our police department\u2019s philosophy of community policing is a false choice, and it is a choice that would ultimately undermine our public safety agenda.\" ||||| After Rahm sues feds, A.G.

Danny Davis (right) announces a federal lawsuit challenging the Justice Department's threats to withhold federal funding from sanctuary cities and states. | Nader Issa/Sun-Times \n \n Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Monday blasted the \u201cpolitical leadership of Chicago\u201d and \u201cthe culture of lawlessness that has beset the city\u201d just hours after Mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s administration sued Sessions to bar him from cutting federal crimefighting funds to sanctuary cities. \n \n Rather than take a hands-off approach to the now-pending litigation, Sessions stepped up attacks on Chicago, the city that has been repeatedly bashed by President Donald Trump because of its ongoing problems with controlling crime. \n \n \u201cTo a degree perhaps unsurpassed by any other jurisdiction, the political leadership of Chicago has chosen deliberately and intentionally to adopt a policy that obstructs this country\u2019s lawful immigration system,\u201d Sessions said in a prepared statement. \u201cThey have demonstrated an open hostility to enforcing laws designed to protect law enforcement \u2014 federal, state, and local \u2014 and reduce crime, and instead have adopted an official policy of protecting criminal aliens who prey on their own residents. \n \n \u201cThis is astounding given the unprecedented violent crime surge in Chicago, with the number of murders in 2016 surpassing both New York and Los Angeles combined. The city\u2019s leaders cannot follow some laws and ignore others and reasonably expect this horrific situation to improve. \n \n \u201cThe mayor complains that the federal government\u2019s focus on enforcing the law would require a \u2018reordering of law enforcement practice in Chicago.\u2019 But that\u2019s just what Chicago needs: a recommitment to the rule of law and to policies that roll back the culture of lawlessness that has beset the city.\u201d \n \n Though the Trump administration has attempted to link sanctuary-city status to the city\u2019s crime problem, the Chicago Sun-Times has reported that illegal immigrants have played no role in the overwhelming majority of the murders that have put the city in the national spotlight. \n \n \u201cI have been a police officer for more than 30 years, and the federal government\u2019s plans will hamper community policing and public safety,\u201d Chicago Police Supt. Eddie Johnson said in response to Sessions. \u201cUndocumented immigrants are not driving violence in Chicago, and that\u2019s why I want our officers focused on community policing and not trying to be the immigration police.\u201d \n \n With the filing of the lawsuit against Sessions, Chicago becomes the fourth city to wage a legal battle against the Trump administration bid to cut the crimefighting grants to sanctuary local governments. \n \n Other lawsuits to block the Justice Department from punishing cities shielding illegal immigrants from federal immigration agents have been filed in federal courts in Seattle, and in California: Santa Clara and San Francisco. \n \n And while each has its own unique facts and circumstances, Chicago\u2019s legal team is tapped in to the loose network of lawyers that has formed for many of these sanctuary cities. \n \n \u201cWe are in regular contact with lawyers in cities and counties around the country related to these issues,\u201d city Corporation Counsel Ed Siskel said \u2013 including from New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New Orleans and Philadelphia. \n \n Chicago\u2019s 46-page complaint asks U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber \u2014 assigned to the case Monday \u2014 to stop the Justice Department from enforcing new conditions it has attached to the grant funds. \n \n The city appears to be making a solid legal case, according to two experts from the University of Chicago Law School: Professor Aziz Huq and Assistant Professor Daniel Hemel. Both pointed out that, according to the city\u2019s lawsuit, Congress did not give the Justice Department the power to create new conditions when it created the grant program. \n \n The Justice Department in recent days detailed the new rule and conditions sanctuary jurisdictions must follow. The first condition would require the city to give the feds, when they ask for it, a 48-hour heads up of the scheduled release date and time \u201cof an alien in the jurisdiction\u2019s custody.\u201d \n \n The second would require the city to give the feds access to \u201cany correctional or detention facility in order to meet with an alien . . . and inquire as to his or her right to be or remain in the United States.\u201d However, the city points out in its lawsuit that Chicago does not have a jail \u2014 only 18 temporary police \u201clockup\u201d facilities. \n \n The city claims the Justice Department is also asking it to again certify its compliance with a federal law barring local governments from not sharing immigration status information with the feds. It is asking to the city to do so \u201cunder the cloud of confusion\u201d created by the new grant conditions, the city is alleging.",

    "document": "Astronauts who have gone on spacewalks consistently speak of space's extraordinarily peculiar odor. \n \n They can't smell it while they're actually bobbing in it, because the interiors of their space suits just smell plastic-y. But upon stepping back into the space station and removing their helmets, they get a strong, distinctive whiff of the final frontier. The odor clings to their suit, helmet, gloves and tools. \n \n Fugitives from the near-vacuum \u2014 probably atomic oxygen, among other things \u2014 the clinging particles have the acrid aroma of seared steak, hot metal and welding fumes. Steven Pearce, a chemist asked by NASA to recreate the space odor on Earth for astronaut training purposes, said the metallic aspect of the scent may come from high-energy vibrations of ions. \n \n \"It's like something I haven't ever smelled before, but I'll never forget it,\" NASA astronaut Kevin Ford said from orbit in 2009. [Space Sights and Smells Surprise Rookie Astronauts] \n \n But astronauts don't dislike the sharp smell of space, necessarily. After a 2003 mission, astronaut Don Pettit described it this way on a NASA blog: \n \n \"It is hard to describe this smell; it is definitely not the olfactory equivalent to describing the palette sensations of some new food as 'tastes like chicken.' The best description I can come up with is metallic; a rather pleasant sweet metallic sensation. It reminded me of my college summers where I labored for many hours with an arc welding torch repairing heavy equipment for a small logging outfit. It reminded me of pleasant sweet smelling welding fumes. That is the smell of space.\" \n \n The interior of the International Space Station smells a little more mundane. Pettit, who recently returned from a second six-month-long mission on the ISS, told SPACE.com, \"[The space station] smells like half machine-shop-engine-room-laboratory, and then when you're cooking dinner and you rip open a pouch of stew or something, you can smell a little roast beef.\" \n \n Editor's note: This story has been corrected to state that Pearce was not hired, but was merely asked, by NASA to recreate the odor of space. \n \n Follow Life's Little Mysteries on Twitter @llmysteries.

Discovery shuttle pilot Kevin Ford, a first-time spaceflyer, said from orbit late Friday. \n \n One of things Ford wasn?t ready for is the weird smell. \n \n ?From the [spacewalks] there really is a distinct smell of space when they come back in,? Ford said from the station in a Friday night news conference. ?It?s like?something I haven?t ever smelled before, but I?ll never forget it. You know how those things stick with you.? \n \n In the past, astronauts have described the smell of space as something akin to gunpowder or ozone. \n \n The sounds of spaceflight have also been surprising, especially when Discovery fires up its large maneuvering thrusters, Ford said. \n \n ?It definitely gives the shuttle a kick and you just feel a little twang throughout the whole orbiter when they?re firing to keep you in position,? he added. \n \n Of the 13 astronauts aboard the International Space Station and docked shuttle, nearly half are taking their first trip to space. For some, it?s a short trip aboard the shuttle, which blasted off last week with three rookies aboard. \n \n Other first-time spaceflyers are on the station for the long haul. Some have already been there for months, so the term ?rookie? barely applies. \n \n ?The food is wonderful,? said rookie astronaut Nicole Stott, who arrived at the station Sunday on Discovery to begin a three-month stay. ?Of course we have a mix from all the partners now.? \n \n The result, she said, is a sort of orbital smorgasbord that includes food from the United States, Russia, Canada, Japan and Europe. \n \n ?I think you can find something for everyone,? Stott said. \n \n Discovery?s seven-astronaut crew is in the middle of a 13-day mission to deliver fresh supplies and new science gear to the space station. The astronauts ferried Stott to the outpost to replace another NASA astronaut who will come home on the shuttle. \n \n They also delivered a $5 million treadmill named after comedian Stephen Colbert. \n \n Even some of Discovery?s grizzled veterans were surprised by the life aboard the station, which is the $100 billion product of 16 different countries. \n \n ?It?s really awesome to see all the work that?s been achieved up here since our last flight,? said Discovery commander Rick Sturckow, who is making his fourth flight to the station. ?They?ve added a new solar array and some new modules.

    "document": "(CNN) A woman killed three people and wounded three others before fatally shooting herself at a drugstore distribution center Thursday in Harford County, Maryland, officials said. \n \n A source close to the investigation said the woman was a disgruntled employee. Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler told reporters the woman was a temporary employee and showed up for work at her normal time at the facility near Aberdeen. \n \n She shot people outside the building and on the warehouse floor, he said. The woman died at a nearby hospital after shooting herself in the head, he said. \n \n She was identified by the sheriff's office as Snochia Moseley, 26, from Baltimore County. \n \n Police are still searching for a motive, he added. \n \n A law enforcement official briefed on the incident said the suspect was at some point a security guard at the Rite Aid support facility where the shooting occurred. \n \n The suspect used a 9 mm Glock pistol and brought several magazines for the gun, Gahler said at a news conference. The gun was hers and was purchased legally, he said. \n \n The sheriff wouldn't release any details about the six victims or the shooter, saying that their next of kin were still being notified. \n \n No law enforcement officers fired shots during their response, he said. Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center received four patients with \"priority one gunshot wounds,\" said spokeswoman Kristin Mears. \n \n At a news conference, Ray Fang, the hospital's trauma medical director, said two of the victims were stable and doing well, while two remain seriously injured. All the victims were out of surgery, he said. \n \n Fang declined to provide additional information until he was sure all the victims' families had been notified. \n \n Rite Aid spokeswoman Susan Henderson said roughly 1,000 employees work at the distribution center, where products are received and processed for delivery. \n \n \"The shooting happened adjacent to the primary building,\" she said. \n \n Neighbor: 'It's right on the doorstep' \n \n Colleen Hendrickson, who lives and works in the area, said she was waiting on the bus when someone told her there had been a shooting nearby. \n \n \"I, of course, thought it was far off or, that's like down the road or something, right?\" she told CNN affiliate WJZ . \"No, it's right outside. It's right on the doorstep.\" \n \n She saw emergency vehicles, including ambulances, and helicopters, which were out of place for the \"sleepy\" part of the county, she said. The area is home to many warehouses and plants, some belonging to major brands, including makeup and bleach companies. \n \n \"It's really just usually very calm, and this is the most chaotic I've ever seen it,\" she told the station. \"It's very scary when it's just right there on your doorstep because you can see a billion news reports about shooters, about emergency instances, and it still doesn't make it real to you.\" \n \n People were being asked to avoid the area just outside the city of Perryman, roughly 30 miles northeast of Baltimore.

Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler declined to release the names the victims, saying families were still being notified of their deaths. \n \n The gun used in the shooting, a 9 mm Glock handgun, was registered and owned by Moseley, he said. \n \n Employees were shot both inside and outside the distribution center, Gahler said. The motive for the shooting is not yet known. \n \n Dispatchers received a report of shots fired at the distribution center at 9:06 a.m., Gahler said, and police and emergency personnel arrived just over five minutes later. \n \n As reports of the shooting circulated, relatives of workers rushed to the area or tried to reach them by phone. Those who were successful said workers told them gunfire suddenly rang out, sending many diving for cover even as they saw their fellow employees struck and falling to the ground. \n \n Others couldn\u2019t reach their loved ones, and only learned later in the afternoon that they had not been hurt when buses brought them to a makeshift reunification center at the Level Volunteer Fire Co. in Havre de Grace. \n \n A temporary employee at a Rite Aid distribution center in Harford County fatally shot three co-workers and injured three others before killing herself Thursday morning, police said. \n \n Andre Cedeno had rushed from his own workplace 25 minutes away to try to see his sister, who was in her second week on the job at the Rite Aid center. Cedeno said she told him she ran inside and hid in a bathroom. \n \n \u201cShe had a panic,\u201d Cedeno said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy that people don\u2019t respect life.\u201d \n \n Rite Aid employs 1,000 full-time, 300 temporary and 30 part-time employees between two distribution facilities in Perryman. \n \n The drug store chain is the largest tenant in its building at Enterprise Business Park where the shooting occurred. Other tenants in the building include Maines Paper & Food, a New York-based food service distributor, and Zenith Global Logistics, a trucking company.

Clorox also halted its operations. \n \n \u201cOur thoughts and prayers go out to all those involved in this tragic incident, as well as their loved ones,\u201d Strella said in an email. \n \n Gahler said multiple agencies responded, and no law enforcement officers fired shots.

Four people were taken to Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in Baltimore and one to Christiana Hospital in Newark, Del. Two died, including the shooter, at Bayview. The other three had non-life-threatening injuries, officials said. \n \n The shootings mark the latest spasm of gun violence to beset Maryland and other parts of the country. In June, a gunman stormed the Capital Gazette newsroom in Annapolis, killing five staff members. Jarrod Ramos, a Laurel man with a grudge against The Capital, is awaiting trial on 23 charges. In March, a student at Great Mills High School in Southern Maryland shot and killed a 16-year-old classmate and injured a 14-year old boy. \n \n And Thursday\u2019s shootings come just 11 months after three co-workers were killed at a kitchen countertop company in Edgewood, less than 10 miles away. Two fellow employees were also injured in the October 2017 attack. \n \n \u201cWe stand here yet again,\u201d Gahler said Thursday as he updated the media. \n \n The Edgewood victims\u2019 co-worker, Radee L. Prince, is awaiting trial in Maryland on murder and firearm charges; he was convicted of attempted manslaughter and other charges for the shooting of a business owner in Wilmington, Del., following the killings in Edgewood. He was sentenced to 40 years in prison for the Delaware shooting. \n \n On Thursday, the Rite Aid center became the third U.S. workplace to erupt in gunfire in the past 24 hours. \n \n \u201cThree workplace active shooting attacks in just the last 24 hours should spark outrage in every American,\u201d former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords said in a statement Thursday. Giffords was shot in the head at a \u201cCongress on Your Corner\u201d event outside a grocery store in the Tucson area in 2011 and has become an anti-gun violence activist. \n \n \u201cIf gun violence feels like it's become an everyday occurrence, that's because it is,\u201d she said. \u201cBut every time you hear news of another shooting, remind yourself that this level of gun violence is not normal. No other developed nation experiences this kind of daily heartbreak and horror.\u201d \n \n Around 11:30 a.m. Wednesday, four people were shot at a software company, WTS Paradigm, in Middleton, Wis., by a 43-year-old co-worker, police said. The gunman was shot and killed by police. Three of the injured were in serious condition as of Thursday morning, one suffered a graze wound. \n \n Then, around 2 p.m., four people including a police officer were shot after a man opened fire outside a judge\u2019s office in a municipal building in Masontown, Pa. The suspect, Patrick Dowdell, 61, was shot and killed by police. Dowdell had a preliminary hearing scheduled for Wednesday on domestic charges of strangulation, aggravated assault and terroristic threats from an incident several weeks ago, according to news reports. \n \n Gov. Larry Hogan said he had been \u201cclosely monitoring\u201d the Harford County situation during the day. \n \n \u201cThe First Lady and I are grieving for the loss of life in today's shooting in Harford County, and praying that those who were injured fully recover,\u201d he said in a tweet. \u201cI remain in close contact with Harford County officials and state and local law enforcement as they continue to investigate.\u201d \n \n Church Creek Elementary School, a few miles away from the shooting scene, had been placed on a modified lockdown Thursday. \n \n When a bus pulled up to the reunification center with Rite Aid workers on board, joy broke out as those waiting outside spotted familiar faces. One woman ran forward with outstretched arms and shouted in glee. ||||| Officials: Woman Kills 3, Injures 3 Before Taking Her Own Life In Aberdeen Shooting \n \n A woman shot and killed three people, and wounded three others before taking her own life at a Rite Aid warehouse in Aberdeen on Thursday. \n \n Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey R. Gahler wasn't ready to identify the 26-year-old in a Thursday afternoon press conference, but said she was a temporary employee whose last known address was in Baltimore County. Authorities do not yet have a motive. \n \n Authorities later confirmed the 26-year-old woman is Snochia Moseley. Prior to that, the 11 News I-Team's Lisa Robinson reached a woman believed to be related to the suspect via telephone. The woman hung up saying, \"I just lost my daughter.\" \n \n Moseley has no prior criminal record. Online court records only show a slew of unresolved traffic cases and a civil case related to an unpaid Baltimore County tax bill. \n \n Investigators believe the shooting began outside Rite Aid's Perryman Distribution Center in the business park at 1501 Perryman Road, then moved inside, Gahler said.

Some patients needed surgery, Fang said, with two in stable condition as of 2:39 p.m. and two \"very seriously injured.\" \n \n One other victim is in serious condition at Christiana Hospital in Newark, Delaware. \n \n County Executive Barry Glassman said Gov.

She said her mother texted her that there is a shooter inside the building. \n \n \"Everybody there is so tight-knit. There's not that many people that work there. Everybody is so nice over there, that's why it's a shock,\" Scharmann said. \n \n While there is security and metal detectors in an adjacent building, Scharmann said the Liberty building where her mother works does not have the same safeguards. \n \n Scharmann said she heard from her mother in a text at 10:33 a.m., saying \"I am outside and safe. I love you.\" \n \n Witnesses and survivors are being taken to a community center in Havre de Grace, Scharmann said. \n \n Bo, who said he lives on Aberdeen Proving Ground, said the area is wooded and has nearby schools. \n \n \"This happened inside the warehouse (on Perryman Road),\" Bo said. \"They called a bunch of EMS and they told us they were carrying out another five victims.\" \n \n Bo said the response from police and paramedics was swift. \n \n \"We didn't know what to do. They were coming in groups of 10. I am not joking, and they were running people off the road. There was even an accident and a head-on collision dead in front of us at a stoplight because they were literally throwing people off the road.

In addition to the alleged hair loss and scalp injuries, court papers claim that Guthy-Renker blocked comments about hair loss from Wen's Facebook page and removed negative online reviews about the products. \n \n In nightmare-fueling fashion, BuzzFeed compiled images from women showing their bald spots and toupee-size hair clumps in the drain, allegedly from using celebrity stylist Chaz Dean's sulfate-free cleanser. \n \n If you haven't heard of Wen, you must've somehow missed Dean's ubiquitous infomercials and marketing promising that his cleanser can replace ordinary shampoo and conditioner.

Posted by Tracie Hashton on Monday, December 7, 2015 \n \n The images are shocking, but The Daily Beast notes that it could be tough for the plaintiffs to prove that Wen is responsible for their hair loss, which could stem from many factors. The first four ingredients in many Wen cleansers are water, glycerin, cetyl alcohol, and cetearyl alcohol, which are commonly used in hair products. Wen does contain a chemical banned in the EU, hydroxycitronella. \n \n Amy Davis, the Dallas-based attorney and lead counsel for the plaintiffs, said that her firm hired chemists to test Wen. \"What we understand about the product and how it causes hair loss is it contains virtually no cleanser,\" she told told a local CBS station. \"It\u2019s like using lotion to wash your hair, so instead of removing the product, when you rinse it off, it just becomes impacted in your hair follicle.\" \n \n In between complaints about customer service, auto shipments and inaccurate charges, Facebook comments on Wen's page have been posted by loyal customers and outraged users alike. There's love for Wen \u2014 \"i use the pomegranate cleansing conditioner. and kid u not, every time i use it and go to the salon for haircut, they tell me that my hair is so healthy,\" one Facebook commenter wrote \u2014 to outright warnings to other consumers \u2014 \"Went from very thick long hair that would break a pony tail holder to extremely thin brittle hair! \u202a#\u200eScam\u202c I Used it for 1 year with nothing else but their products! Pleeeeease Don't buy this Product if u love your hair like I did!!!\" \n \n The Daily Beast reports that both sides are heading to mediation. \"The parties are attempting to settle their differences outside of court and we have agreed to refrain from any extrajudicial statements about the case in the meantime,\" Davis told The Daily Beast. \n \n Here's the statement gave BuzzFeed: ||||| DOWN THE DRAIN \n \n Chaz Dean\u2019s sulfate-free hair-care products have a cult following. But a new lawsuit alleges they also caused hair loss, scalp damage, and more. \n \n Anyone who has channel-surfed at 3 a.m. and watched celebrity hair stylist Chaz Dean work his magic on the manes of Brooke Shields and Alyssa Milano will be familiar with the WEN hair care range. \n \n Billed as a sulfate-free alternative to shampoo, WEN promises to \u201ctake the place of your shampoo, conditioner, deep conditioner, detangler, and leave-in conditioner.\u201d \n \n But the cult favorite products have also attracted controversy. Over the years, horror stories from customers have circulated online\u2014on WEN product forums and sites including Pissed Consumer and Amazon\u2014about WEN\u2019s 5-in-1 Cleansing Conditioners causing hair to come out in handfuls, as well as clogged drains and bald spots. \n \n Now, more than 200 women in 40 states have joined a class action lawsuit against WEN by Chaz Dean and infomercial giant Guthy-Renker in California Federal Court. They claim that the WEN products can cause severe and possibly permanent damage to hair, including significant hair loss to the point of visible bald spots, hair breakage, scalp irritation, and rash. \n \n According to court papers, nurse practitioner Amy Friedman bought the WEN Sweet Almond Mint basic kit in January of 2014 for $29.95, and within two weeks \u201cbegan losing substantial and abnormal amounts of hair.\u201d The shedding continued, she said, for approximately three weeks after she stopped using WEN, and eventually resulted in her losing \u201cone quarter to one third\u201d of the hair on her head. In an attempt to regrow her hair, she claims that she was forced to spend a substantial amount money on vitamins and extensions to mask the loss. \n \n The suit alleges that Friedman\u2019s complaint is only the tip of the iceberg\u2014and states that the number of potential plaintiffs in the class suit could number \u201cin the thousands or tens of thousands.\u201d \n \n Indeed, a Google search brings up hundreds of negative reviews. \u201cI was a professional model with beautiful long natural hair. After using this product my scalp and face broke out in boils and my hair fell out in chunks,\u201d one woman wrote. \u201cThis shampoo destroyed my life.\u201d \n \n Another user said that she loved the product at first\u2014but after five months \u201cI noticed a bald spot the size of a half dollar at the crown of my head.\u201d \n \n Yet just as many five-star WEN fans claim that the products have been the best thing that has ever happened to their hair\u2014and five-star reviews have led to the products repeatedly ranking #1 under hair care on Amazon. \n \n WEN has been a huge cash cow for Guthy-Renker, reportedly raking $100 million in only its second year, and has made Chaz Dean as famous as many of his celebrity clients. The suit has been shocking for many customers due to the holistic lifestyle and organic philosophy that Dean espouses in his salon, infomercials, and on Instagram. \n \n According to the bio on his website, Dean started out as a hairdresser in Los Angeles and created the formula that became WEN by mixing the ingredients in his sink. His celebrity-to-the-stars status was cemented after he used Sweet Almond Mint cleansing conditioner on Alanis Morrissette for her Grammy appearance in 1999. \n \n Dean has remained down-to-earth and likable in spite of his fame, and is a regular on reality shows including Flipping Out and Celebrity Apprentice, has purchased properties including a Greenwich Village townhouse for $10 million, and flies his four rescue Labradors on a private jet in between their WEN grooming sessions and twice-daily hikes. \n \n According to court papers, the company\u2019s website makes statements such as \u201cWEN\u00ae is gentle enough to use every day,\u201d and \u201cWEN\u00ae isn\u2019t like an ordinary shampoo so you want to use more of it, not less,\u201d and \u201cYou can never use too much! The more you use, the better the results.\u201d \n \n Not only did the company fail to warn customers of the dangers, the suit alleges, but Guthy-Renker also apparently removed negative online reviews about the products, and blocked or erased comments about hair loss from the WEN Facebook page. \n \n Despite this, many are still available: \u201cNot only did it not clean my hair, it made it look like I combed it out with a pork chop,\u201d one woman wrote on the WEN product forum. Another said that she was distressed at having to explain that her hair loss was \u201cnot from chemo.\u201d \n \n Exactly which ingredients may be causing hair loss remains a mystery. The complaint alleges that \u201cthe WEN products at issue contain a caustic ingredient that causes a chemical reaction and damages hair and follicles,\u201d as well as \u201cnumerous harsh chemicals and known human allergens.\u201d \n \n But the first four ingredients on many of the cleansing conditioners are listed as \u201cwater, glycerin, cetyl alcohol, and cetearyl alcohol.\u201d Alcohol can be drying, but it is widely used in hair care products. Another ingredient, hydroxycitronella, is banned in the EU because it is known to be a human immune system toxin. \n \n In the complaint, Guthy-Renker categorically denies that its products are in any way defective or responsible for hair loss. But over the years, many stylists have swapped their own theories over the shampoo bowl. \u201cWEN seems to be good for certain hair types, especially those that are coarse or frizzy,\u201d says Kelsey Smart, a stylist at Fox & Jane salon in New York. \u201cBut for women with fine hair, it becomes more important for the scalp to stay really clean\u2014otherwise, product can build up and lead to breakage.\u201d Ironically, women who need a squeaky-clean scalp may be in most need of the sulfates that Dean has tried so diligently to avoid. \n \n Get The Beast In Your Inbox!

According to the American Dermatological Society, it can be caused by a number of factors from genetics, hair dryer and flat iron use, to hormonal changes from pregnancy. Dermatologists often have to turn detective and perform a series of tests in order to determine the cause. \n \n Narrowing down the offending ingredient(s) becomes even more complicated due to the fact that WEN is sold all over the world, so there are multiple formulas available\u2014as well as various knock-offs. \u201cOfficial\u201d WEN products are sold through www.chazdean.com, Guthy-Renker, Sephora, and QVC. \n \n Tara Bell, who describes herself as a 52-year-old former hairdresser, wrote on the WEN message board that she loved the Lavender Cleansing Conditioner that she bought from QVC but had an extreme reaction to a bottle that was ordered from Amazon. (Amazon is meant for international buyers, but many U.S. customers buy from the site in order to avoid the monthly billing of buying direct from WEN.) \n \n \u201cAfter I rinsed it I noticed some of the bleached hair in the front was \u2018sticky\u2019 like glue and actually breaking off. I am in shock,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI have now been super paranoid about the hair I find in the drain and have been researching and seeing all the horror stories about lawsuits. There are different formulas depending on who you buy it from,\u201d she added. \n \n Jillian, a WEN customer service representative who posted on the company\u2019s website, confirms that Guthy-Renker\u2019s version of WEN is slightly different than the one sold via www.chazdean.com and QVC. \n \n \u201cBecause of regulations on products sold internationally, the ingredients through Guthy-Renker have had to be changed slightly. Chaz worked very hard to make sure that the quality and philosophy behind WEN is still upheld, and that product performance would be identical,\u201d she wrote. \n \n For now, the parties are heading to mediation\u2014so the reasons for hair loss may remain a mystery. \n \n \u201cThe parties are attempting to settle their differences outside of court and we have agreed to refrain from any extrajudicial statements about the case in the meantime,\u201d Davis told The Daily Beast.",

    "document": "Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Nine former professional hockey players have filed a lawsuit against the N.H.L. that says the league \u201cintentionally created, fostered and promoted a culture of extreme violence.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The suit, which was filed Wednesday in federal court in Manhattan, is the latest in a growing string of challenges to the N.H.L. Similar to suits brought by retired N.F.L. players, the complaint said that the N.H.L. failed to take adequate steps to warn the players of the dangers of the sport and deliberately promoted violence for profit. \n \n The complaint is more graphic than other suits brought by former hockey players, highlighting the role of enforcers in the N.H.L. over many years and mentioning movies that celebrated fighting in hockey. \n \n \u201cThrough the sophisticated use of extreme violence as a commodity, from which the N.H.L. has generated billions of dollars, the N.H.L. has subjected and continues to subject its players to the imminent risk of head trauma and, as a result, devastating and long-term negative health consequences,\u201d the lawsuit said. \n \n The plaintiffs in the suit are the former players Dan LaCouture, 36; Dan Keczmer, 45; Jack Carlson, 59; Richard Brennan, 41; Brad Maxwell, 56; Michael Peluso, 48; Tom Younghans, 61; Allan Rourke, 34; and Scott Bailey, 41. \n \n Some of the players were brawlers, like Carlson, who racked up 1,111 penalty minutes in the N.H.L. and the World Hockey Association. \n \n Peluso, who played in the N.H.L. from 1990 to 1998, led the league with 408 penalty minutes in 1991-92 and fought, according to the suit, 179 times in his nine-year career. In a 2011 interview with juniorhockey.com, Peluso said he was suffering concussion-related seizures and depression in retirement and complained about poor pension benefits and health insurance from the N.H.L. and the N.H.L. Players\u2019 Association. \n \n \u201cThere is no question in my mind that brain injuries and depression are linked,\u201d Peluso told the website. \u201cHowever, I find it has more to do with low self-esteem. Former skilled guys suffered head injuries, and they don\u2019t appear to be suicidal.\u201d \n \n LaCouture, who retired in 2009, was involved in 52 fights. The lawsuit said he sustained a concussion at the hands of Robyn Regehr in 2004 and suffered from headaches, irritability, depression and other ailments. \n \n Other players in the lawsuit were journeymen who rarely fought, like Rourke, who, according to hockeyfights.com, had 17 fights in his 14-year major junior and professional career. Keczmer never accumulated more than 75 minutes in penalties in a season during his 10-year professional career and, according to the suit, had one N.H.L. fight. \n \n The case will be heard by Judge Shira A. Scheindlin of Federal District Court in Manhattan. \n \n This is the latest lawsuit involving violence in the N.H.L. In May, the family of Derek Boogaard filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against the N.H.L., saying the league was responsible for the physical trauma and brain damage Boogaard sustained in six seasons as one of the league\u2019s top enforcers. Boogaard died of an accidental overdose of prescription painkillers and alcohol in 2011. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n In November, a group of players who were in the league in the 1970s, \u201980s and \u201990s filed a lawsuit in federal court in Washington, saying N.H.L. officials should have done more to address head injuries but instead celebrated a culture of speed and violence. \n \n Photo \n \n The civil suit of the former Colorado Avalanche player Steve Moore against Todd Bertuzzi and the Vancouver Canucks is scheduled to be heard in an Ontario court in September. Bertuzzi attacked Moore during a game in March 2004, breaking three of Moore\u2019s neck vertebrae and ending his career. \n \n Bill Daly, deputy commissioner of the N.H.L., said that this week\u2019s suit did not appear to be substantively different from the one filed in November. \n \n \u201cIn short, we are completely satisfied with our record on player safety, including as it relates to head injuries and brain trauma,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe do not believe the new complaint provides any valid basis for liability or damages as against the National Hockey League, and we intend to defend the case and others that may follow it vigorously.\u201d \n \n The N.H.L. set up a concussion study program in 1997, the first in North American major league sports, and has in recent years modified rules to address head trauma. But the lawsuit calls those moves \u201cuntimely and ineffective.\u201d \n \n Lawyers representing the players did not return calls for comment, though their complaint includes mentions of the Broad Street Bullies of the 1970s Philadelphia Flyers and movies like \u201cThe Last Gladiators\u201d and \u201cMystery, Alaska.\u201d (The complaint also mistakenly said that Gordie Howe, who is still alive, died in 2009.) \n \n While the complaint seeks a jury trial, experts said the players would prefer to settle out of court, no doubt aware of the $765 million proposed settlement between the N.F.L. and retired football players. \n \n The suits brought by thousands of retired N.F.L. players were filed in states over many months. They were eventually consolidated and heard in federal court in Philadelphia. That is a possible course of action for the N.H.L. cases, which so far involve only a few dozen players. \n \n The two most recent complaints allege that the league was negligent in not doing more to warn players about concussions and committed fraud by hiding information it had about the dangers. \n \n Proving those allegations, though, could be as difficult as it has been for the retired N.F.L. players. The N.H.L. players will have to provide evidence that the league hid information about the dangers of fighting. The players will also have to show that injuries they received in the N.H.L. led to their current ailments. \n \n The plaintiffs \u201cwould like to have a settlement within the contours of what you\u2019ve found in the attempted settlement with the N.F.L.,\u201d said Mark Conrad, the director of the sports business program at Fordham University. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t underestimate the league\u2019s ability to fight this.\u201d ||||| Nine former players filed a class action lawsuit against the NHL on Thursday, alleging that the league subjected players to \"the imminent risk of head trauma\" leading to long-term negative health consequences. \n \n The lawsuit, filed in a U.S. District Court in New York, is the second filed against the National Hockey League in less than five months to claim the league did not do enough to prevent concussions. \n \n The latest complaint alleges that, \"the NHL has failed and continues to fail to warn its players of these risks and consequences of head trauma.\" \n \n The suit also claims the NHL concealed material scientific and anecdotal information from players. \n \n \"The NHL has failed to institute policies and protocols that could have and will protect its players from suffering or exacerbating head trauma sustained during practice or in games,\" read the complaint. \n \n Among the plaintiffs, Dan LaCouture, Jack Carlson, Mike Peluso and Tom Younghans spent their careers as enforcers and piled up more minutes in fighting penalties than points. \n \n The other players named in the lawsuit were Dan Keczmer, Richard Brennan, Brad Maxwell, Allan Rourke and Scott Bailey. \n \n \"Through enclosed rink designs and lax rules for fighting, the NHL vectored a culture of extreme violence and packaged the spoils to adoring fans.\" continued the suit. \n \n The NHL did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n \n A lawsuit filed last year that started with 10 plaintiffs but has since grown to over 200, said it was time for the NHL to elevate player safety over profit and tradition. \n \n Concussions have been in the NHL spotlight for years. \n \n Pittsburgh Penguins captain Sidney Crosby, the game's most popular player and face of the NHL, missed large chunks of two seasons as he slowly recovered from concussion symptoms. \n \n Several other players, including former All-Stars Eric Lindros, Pat LaFontaine and Keith Primeau, were all forced to prematurely end their careers due to concussion issues. \n \n In 2011, three former NHL enforcers, Derek Boogaard, Rick Rypien and Wade Belak died tragically raising concerns about a possible link between the deaths and the players' tough guy roles and concussions. \n \n Last year the National Football League paid $765 million to settle a similar lawsuit brought by thousands of former players, many suffering from dementia and health problems. \n \n (Reporting by Steve Keating in Toronto; Editing by Frank Pingue) ||||| In seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, the players said in their complaint that the N.H.L. \u201cknew or should have been aware\u201d of the effects of head hits but \u201ctook no remedial action to prevent its players from unnecessary harm\u201d until 1997, when the league created a program to research and study brain injuries. Even then, the suit said, \u201cthe N.H.L. took no action to reduce the number and severity of concussions among its players during that period and Plaintiffs relied on the N.H.L.\u2019s silence to their detriment.\u201d \n \n Owens and other lawyers said in a statement, \u201cThe N.H.L. continues to glorify and empower players known as \u2018enforcers\u2019 \u2014 players with the singular intention of injuring the opposing team.\u201d \n \n Bill Daly, the N.H.L.\u2019s deputy commissioner, said in a statement: \u201cWhile the subject matter is very serious, we are completely satisfied with the responsible manner in which the league and the players association have managed player safety over time, including with respect to head injuries and concussions. We intend to defend the case vigorously and have no further comment at this time.\u201d \n \n Though hockey players have sustained concussions and other head injuries for generations, the N.H.L. faced less scrutiny about its policies than the N.F.L. The N.H.L. set up a concussion study program in 1997, the first in North American major league sports, and has in recent years modified rules in response to increased concern about head trauma. \n \n In May, the family of Derek Boogaard filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against the N.H.L., saying the league was responsible for the physical trauma and brain damage Boogaard sustained in six seasons as one of the league\u2019s top enforcers. Boogaard was found dead of an accidental overdose of prescription painkillers and alcohol in 2011. He was posthumously found to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., a brain disease thought to be caused by repeated blows to the head.",

The suit also claims the league stayed mum on the risks of head trauma and kept scientific evidence on that subject from players, Reuters reports. \"The NHL has subjected and continues to subject its players to the imminent risk of head trauma and, as a result, devastating and long-term negative health consequences,\" the suit continues. It also notes recent head trauma-minded rule changes have been \"untimely and ineffective.\" The NHL's deputy commissioner, however, says, \"we are completely satisfied with our record on player safety, including as it relates to head injuries and brain trauma.\" Experts say the players likely want an out-of-court settlement.",

    "document": "There\u2019s been a bunch of internet uproar (which to be fair translates to a low hum) over Gabourey Sidibe\u2019s Elle cover. The magazine\u2019s 25th-anniversary October issue features 25 women in their 20s who are really goin\u2019 for it! Sidibe, Megan Fox, Lauren Conrad, and Amanda Seyfried get separate covers, and Gabby\u2019s is the only one that\u2019s framed close-up. People can\u2019t handle it! Among the criticisms: She should do the same pose as everyone else. Her skin seems lighter. Her weave is bad. Sidibe\u2019s inclusion \u201cfeels like a weird fetishization that borders on patronizing,\u201d says Salon. \n \n I don\u2019t see what the problem is here. Elle picked Gabourey Sidibe as a game-changer, so she is on one of the covers. Would people be less upset if Elle had put each of these four women into the same tiny dress and asked \u201cWho\u2019s wearin\u2019 it best?\u201d They constructed the Sidibe cover in a specific way so that she would look her best, and she looks beautiful. Is it really so jarring to see someone heavy on a magazine cover that people need to freak out over how it \u201cshould look\u201d instead? This is how it looks. \n \n \u201cWe have four separate covers this month, and Gabby\u2019s cover was not retouched any more or less than the others,\u201d said Elle in a statement. \u201cWe had 25 cover-worthy subjects in our portfolio and we chose Gabby because of who she is\u2026.We shot this as a story of exuberant young women changing the world. If you take a look at the portfolio, each of the women were shot in different ways and for different reasons.\u201d \n \n Fair enough? \n \n Annie on Twitter: @EWAnnieBarrett ||||| Gabourey Sidibe has landed her first fashion magazine cover, kind of. The 25-year-old ingenue is the solo cover for the October issue of Elle magazine. Starting next month, you can pick up a copy of Elle with Sidibe flashing her pearly whites and glamming it up for the cameras in an emerald green Tadashi Shoji dress. \n \n Except look closely, and you\u2019ll notice there\u2019s something off in Sidibe\u2019s cover photo. Sidibe\u2019s skin is noticeably lighter than usual. Elle clearly couldn\u2019t handle Sidibe\u2019s real skin color, and traded away her actual color for something dramatically lighter. \n \n It\u2019s a common, tired practice, and the routine is well-practiced: beauty companies and fashion magazines regularly lighten women\u2019s skin (and darken the faces of black men), pissed off consumers shout back, and sometimes an apology is issued. But come the next fall collection or election season, photo retouchers are inevitably back to trying to make women of color more attractive by lightening them, and darkening the skin of men of color to make them seem more dangerous and suspect. Color, still, is everything. \n \n And that\u2019s just one thing Elle got wrong with its Sidibe cover. By cropping Sidibe\u2019s cover photo so close, Elle may have been trying to hide her full-figured body\u2014its own travesty\u2014but they only made her seem bigger. Sidibe doesn\u2019t get the standard female cover photo treatment: three-quarters of the woman\u2019s body centered with strong margins of white space on either side of the woman. She gets a uniquely awkward cropped shot. \n \n And I\u2019ll just say what I know you\u2019re thinking: the weave Elle gave her is not doing Sidibe any favors. It\u2019s the kind of unflattering and embarrassingly obvious weave that a fashion magazine should be ashamed to put on anyone. (And Elle\u2019s done it to Beyonce in the past, too.) \n \n Landing a cover is a big deal for any star, more so for Sidibe, whose skin color and wise-cracking smarts and body type make her something of an obvious outsider in Hollywood. Sidibe\u2019s also been famously snubbed by fashion magazines. She was reportedly passed over by Vogue, because she was too big. And in March, Sidibe was left off a Vanity Fair cover of nine young actresses for the magazine\u2019s \u201cYoung Hollywood 2010!\u201d spread. The women who made the cut were, you guessed it, all white. \n \n At the time, Access Hollywood asked her about how it felt to be sidelined in favor of five nearly identical pale white female actresses. Sidibe, with her characteristically tough mettle, shrugged it off: \n \n \u201cWas I satisfied? Yeah, well\u2026 I mean, I come from a world where I\u2019m not on covers and I\u2019m not in magazines at all,\u201d Gabourey said. \u201cAnd so I was happy to be in the magazine. \u201cAt first I thought, \u2018Hmm, should I be there?\u201d she continued, about the cover shoot. \u201cThen I very quickly got over it. I think if I were a part of that shoot I would have felt a little left out anyway.\u201d \n \n And judging from October\u2019s Elle, it may have been just as well that Sidibe was left off the Vanity Fair cover. The fashion industry clearly gets flummoxed by any woman whose body and skin color are outside American society\u2019s narrow definitions of beauty. In 2007, Vogue also ran an unflattering photo of Jennifer Hudson when they gave her a cover. It\u2019s illustrative of all the ways that when it comes to full-figured women of color, landing a fashion magazine cover isn\u2019t always a compliment. Too bad for the fashion industry; it pays time and again for its racial faux pas with ridicule from the rest of the world. But unfortunately for us, fashion magazines don\u2019t operate in a vacuum. If only the fashion and beauty industries were not a reflection of our culture and our society, our own ignorance. It\u2019d be so much easier to make fun of. \n \n \n \n \n \n h/t Womanist Musings ||||| Airbrushing Controversy Surrounds Gabourey Sidibe Elle Cover \n \n Email This \n \n \n \n Elle magazine is denying accusations that it digitally lightened the skin of Oscar-nominated actress Gabourey Sidibe, who is appearing on one of the October issue's four celebrity covers. \n \n \n \n The controversy is the second magazine swirl Sidibe's name has been tied to in 2010.

The network announced Wednesday a new series titled Born in the Wild that chronicles pregnant women giving birth outdoors, unassisted by doctors. \u201cWhat happens when the craziest experience of a woman\u2019s life becomes truly wild, and soon-to-be parents decide to take on an unassisted birth in the outdoors?\u201d asks the press release. \u201cBorn in the Wild will document the journeys of young, expectant parents who have chosen to give birth \u2018in the wild.'\u201d \n \n It\u2019s certainly a head-turning TV hook. But one obstetrician says we already know what happens when women give birth in the wild, and it isn\u2019t good. \u201cI understand everybody wants to believe we overmedicalize pregnancy and that it\u2019s a natural process. But it\u2019s a natural process that historically has caused an extraordinary loss of life,\u201d says Ron Jaekle, MD, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center and the Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Fetal Center. \u201cThere is not a single piece of literature that we had to read growing up that didn\u2019t talk about somebody\u2019s mother or wife dying in childbirth, it was part of the national vocabulary. In the 1900s, a women died for every 1,000 babies born in the United States. Today it\u2019s .1 for every 1,000.\u201d \n \n The Lifetime series is taking precautions to help ensure the safety of the mother and child. No first-time mothers will be allowed to participate on the show and all participants will have a clean bill of health. A trained emergency professional will be on site. And while the couple will choose the birthing location, the production will remain within a certain radius of a hospital should complications arise. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised an OB-GYN would say that [but] we\u2019re taking extreme precautions to make sure the mothers and the babies are safe,\u201d says Eli Lehrer, Lifetime\u2019s senior VP and head of nonfiction programming. \u201cOur presence at these births is going to make them far safer than if they were doing it on their own.\u201d \n \n The series itself was inspired by a viral video showing a birth in a forest that racked up 20 million views (photo above). Lehrer says he has a personal connection to the show\u2019s concept himself as his second child was born at home via midwife. \u201cThis isn\u2019t [Discovery Channel\u2019s] Naked and Afraid and we\u2019re dropping people in the woods and saying \u2018go have the baby,'\u201d he says. \u201cThese are all people who have already had babies in hospitals who had unsatisfying experiences and who are choosing to have different experiences. This is something people are doing and we set out to document it.\u201d \n \n Even with the safety measures in place, however, Jaekle insists Born in the Wild \u201cdoesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d He contends that even with modern medical care, just giving birth at home \u2014 let alone in a forest \u2014 is demonstrably more risky. \u201c[The number of children impacted] is a small number \u2014 until it\u2019s your kid,\u201d Jaekle says of home birth complications. \u201cThey can\u2019t possibly make it safe enough to not [eventually] have a problem that will need a medical intervention to save the day. And then [the producers] won\u2019t interview the docs in the ICU who will say, \u2018This would never have happened if she had been in a hospital.'\u201d \n \n Another possible concern is the show inspiring couples not protected by the production\u2019s safety net to try this more extreme \u201cnatural\u201d route, something that\u2019s particularly unsafe for first-time mothers (which the show will not allow to participate). \u201cI\u2019m not worried this is going to spark a trend,\u201d Lehrer says. \u201cI truly don\u2019t think this is something people would enter into lightly. This is a very specific subset of people doing this.\u201d \n \n The series was one of four new unscripted shows the network announced Wednesday. The network also ordered Girlfriend Intervention, a racial twist on Bravo\u2019s classic Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, about \u201cfour wise, poised and stylish African American women, who, in each episode, help a white sister seeking a complete makeover to restore her confidence and inner glow.\u201d There\u2019s also Threads, a \u201ccompetition series showcasing America\u2019s most talented young fashion designers,\u201d and Kosher Soul, following a stylist and comedian who converts to Judaism to please his wife.",

    "document": "Washington (CNN) Two former friends of Sen. John McCain say his daughter Meghan McCain's pointed criticism of President Donald Trump in her speech at the Arizona Republican's memorial service on Saturday reflected the character of her late father. \n \n \"She is her father's daughter,\" South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"If you say something bad about her dad, you will know it, whether you're the janitor or the President of the United States.

Joe Lieberman, who joined the program with Graham, said he was a \"proud uncle\" watching McCain's speech at the memorial service. \n \n \"She was direct ... the way John was,\" Lieberman said. \n \n In her remarks on Saturday, McCain contrasted her father's legacy with Trump's rhetoric, saying, \"The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again, because America was always great.\" \n \n The comment received applause at the service and highlighted the broad differences between McCain and Trump, who was not invited to attend. \n \n Graham and Lieberman were two of McCain's top allies in the Senate and his close friends -- they were often called the \"three amigos\" -- and their praise for his daughter came after she posted a photo of herself with them online reflecting that bond, calling the two senators her \"uncles forever.\" \n \n During Sunday's interview, the pair looked back fondly on their time with McCain and their travels together. \n \n \"His own attitude, the way he faced death with characteristic fearlessness and perspective, really comforted me,\" Lieberman said. \"But you know, we're going to miss him. He's irreplaceable.\" \n \n Graham, who offered an emotional tribute to McCain last week on the Senate floor, predicted McCain would be remembered as a cornerstone in Senate history. \n \n \"John loved the Senate,\" Graham said. \"He was a man of the Senate. He loved the institution. When you write the history of the Senate, he's going to be in the first chapter.\" \n \n Later in the interview, Graham said the responses to McCain's death showed the appreciation people had for military service, and he outlined a \"formula\" for those who wanted to engage in public service. \n \n \"Work hard, know what you're talking about, and people will listen to you,\" Graham said. \"Pick a cause worthy of a good fight.

    "document": "An orca named J35 has finally dropped her dead calf, which she'd been pushing with her head for at least 17 days and 1,000 miles off the Pacific Northwest coast, in an unprecedented show of mourning that drew international attention. \n \n The sad spectacle was a prime example, and confirmation, of the complex emotional lives of these sophisticated cetaceans, experts say. \n \n Other orcas, and similar animals like dolphins, have been seen apparently mourning their dead, but this is by far the longest recorded example of such behavior. \n \n J35, nicknamed Tahlequah, is a 20-year-old member of the long-studied J Pod of Southern Resident Killer Whales. These orcas, along with their endangered extended family\u2014K and L pods\u2014inhabit a huge territory that includes waters off Seattle, Vancouver, and Victoria, British Columbia. \n \n Researchers worried that this \"tour of grief\" might seriously endanger the health of J35, but luckily, she appears to have made it through physically unharmed. \"Telephoto digital images taken from shore show that this mother whale appears to be in good physical condition,\" the Center for Whale Research noted in an update, \"following her record-setting ordeal. \n \n As J35\u2019s sojourn continued, some experts wondered why she was so attached to the calf. Was it because the calf lived for about 30 minutes after it was born? Jenny Atkinson, executive director of The Whale Museum in Friday Harbor, British Columbi, thinks the grief Tahlequah is feeling is deeper because after 17 months of gestation, she then had the chance to form an emotional connection with her baby before it died. \n \n \u201cI think that\u2019s quite possible,\u201d says John Ford, an orca researcher at the University of British Columbia. \u201cThe whales have a very strong drive to look after their offspring and this evidently extends to neonates that die at birth.\u201d \n \n The death of another calf is a significant blow to J Pod, which hasn\u2019t seen a successful birth in three years. Combined, the three pods have 75 members, and time is running out to maintain its viability.

Unfortunately, Chinook salmon are also endangered,\u201d he adds. \n \n Experts expressed relief that J35 survived. As a 20-year-old in her prime, the pod needs her to reproduce. \n \n \u201cEven without this death, this is a population in crisis,\u201d Atkinson says. \u201cThey need our stewardship and support if they are to survive.\u201d ||||| Please enable Javascript to watch this video \n \n FRIDAY HARBOR, Wash. -- A southern resident orca mother carried her dead calf in the waters off Washington's coast for a 10th straight day Thursday, in what researchers are calling a \"tour of grief.\" \n \n Affiliates of the Center for Whale Research spotted J35 - known as Tahlequah - carrying her dead calf in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, according to Taylor Shedd of Soundwatch. She trailed slightly behind the main J-Pod, but was accompanied by her immediate family. \n \n The whales appeared to be headed west to open waters. \n \n J35 was first spotted July 24 carrying the calf on her nose and in her mouth. The calf was only seen alive briefly. By the time biologists from the Center for Whale Research arrived at her side, the calf was dead. \n \n On Wednesday, the calf was seen decomposing and had lots its rigidity. \n \n Shedd told Q13 News he asked whale watching vessels to keep their distance from J35 and J50, a 4-year-old orca that was seen earlier this month severely emaciated. \n \n Please enable Javascript to watch this video \n \n Michael Weiss, a field biologist with the Center for Whale Research, said whale watching boats were mostly voluntarily keeping their distance from the grieving orca. \n \n Researchers across the field said J35's actions are unprecedented. The traumatic scene unfolding day after day has weighed on scientists who watch the mammals closely. \n \n \"As it's gone on, it's become less shocking,\" Weiss said. \"It's no less sad and I think we're all just tired. Everyone who is on the water with her hopes that she will let it go soon.\" \n \n J35 is in OK shape, and her breathing has grown less labored as the days go on. She is being fed with the help of her close family, Weiss said. And her son, J47, hasn't moved far from her side. \n \n \"I find it very interesting to watch,\" Weiss said of the close relationship between J35 and J47. \n \n An audio recording of what appeared to be J35 making \"mournful and prominent\" calls was given to Q13 News by Michael Harris, a well known marine expert and conservationist. \n \n Please enable Javascript to watch this video \n \n Q13 News will update this story at 4 and 5 p.m. ||||| As an orca mother shoulders her dead calf through the coastal waters of British Columbia and Washington state for a ninth day, government officials, scientists and volunteers are warning off vessels approaching the grieving whale and her pod. \n \n \"We've had enforcement folks out every day to ensure that where there may be boating behaviour that's not appropriate,\u201d Department of Fisheries and Oceans marine mammal co-ordinator Paul Cottrell told CTV News. \u201c[Boaters] are being educated and also dealt with.\" \n \n The sight of the whale, labeled J35, has generated international interest with the poignant photos of the orca gently raising her calf above the water\u2019s surface. This type of grieving ritual is well-documented, but J35 has carried it out much longer than scientists have observed before. \n \n J-pod, the group of 75 related Southern Resident killer whales, has followed J35 through the Salish Sea during the grieving ritual. Scientists believe they\u2019re feeding the mourning mother from their own salmon catch as she remains fixated on the calf. But officials are increasingly concerned she\u2019s exhausting herself by continuing the funereal tour through local waters. \n \n \u201c[It\u2019s a matter of] the sheer amount of effort J35 is expending with maintaining the calf in tow and also diving down as it sinks to pick it back up,\" explains Cottrell. \n \n J35 gave birth off Victoria\u2019s Clover Point on July 24. Officials still aren\u2019t sure if the female calf was stillborn or died shortly after and are counting on a necropsy to determine when she died and why. \n \n A sprawling joint effort between Canadian and American volunteers and federal officials is tracking the pod as they criss-cross through the Gulf and San Juan Islands and even approach populated areas. On Monday, Taylor Shedd documented J35 shepherding the dead calf in the waters near Deltaport with the piles of coal and cranes visible in the background. \n \n Officials aren\u2019t revealing the exact location of the pod at this point out of concern more boaters will want to see the grieving whale for themselves, only saying J35 and her pod are in Canadian waters and under the jurisdiction of DFO. \n \n While the agency is warning mariners to stay away from J-pod, they ask anyone who sees a whale in distress from the water or shore to immediately report it to their incident line at 1-800-465-4335. A quick response could mean the difference between successful intervention and a long, drawn-out search for an injured mammal. \n \n Not only has the calf\u2019s brief life tugged at international heartstrings, it\u2019s triggered more concern among the scientific community. Despite a baby boom three years ago, none of the orca calves born to the resident killer whale group since the start of 2016 has survived and their preferred food source of fatty chinook salmon continues to dwindle. \n \n Researchers such as Victoria marine zoologist Dr. Anna Hall say the salmon will ultimately be their key to survival. \n \n \u201cAll of the actions that have taken place to date are terrific and we need to keep moving forward,\u201d she told CTV News last week. \u201cOne of the important messages is continuing to make sure there are sufficient salmon particularly chinook salmon for the killer whales.\u201d \n \n There are only 75 whales in J-pod, and a four year-old whale known as J-50 is cause for concern as the youngster looks underfed to trained observers tracking the group. Researchers plan to use photogrammetry from a distance in the coming days to see how she\u2019s faring. \n \n That won\u2019t happen until J35 gives up her dead calf and moves on. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a sad situation,\u201d says Cottrell, who\u2019s urging long weekend mariners to steer clear. \n \n \u201cWe want people to respect the rules and the regulations put in place to ensure [the whales] are protected and they're not disturbed and they can do what they need to do. We want this population to thrive and recover.\" ||||| Members of a pod of endangered killer whales now appear to be taking turns floating the body of a newborn calf that died more than week ago. \n \n As It Happens reported on Friday about J-35, a mother orca from B.C.'s endangered killer whale population that has been balancing her dead calf on her nose near San Juan Island, Wash. \n \n It's now been more than a week and the mother whale is still carrying the calf's remains \u2014 sparking concerns among researchers that she'll tire herself out. \n \n \"We do know her family is sharing the responsibility of caring for this calf, that she's not always the one carrying it, that they seem to take turns,\" Jenny Atkinson, director of the Whale Museum on San Juan Island, told As It Happens guest host Piya Chattopadhyay. \n \n \"While we don't have photos of the other whales carrying it, because we've seen her so many times without the calf, we know that somebody else has it.\" \n \n New audio released \n \n The Whale Museum released an audio recording on Monday of the mother communicating with her pod. \n \n \"You're hearing them communicate with one another. They're using a series of calls and whistles to communicate. And then you'll hear a clicking noise. That's echo-location,\" Atkinson said. \n \n \"They use it to pick up their food source as well as map their underwater environment.\" \n \n The Whale Museum recorded the sound of the killer whale pod communicating to each other off San Juan Island, using geo-location to alert each other to potential obstacles and food sources. 0:20 \n \n She said it's possible the sounds are related to their mourning of the calf \u2014 but researchers can't know for sure. \n \n \"We picked up some calls earlier in the week and we hear things that sounded more like a very urgent call,\" she said. \"If you think of going to a wake for a family, things can go on for multiple days and the grief is still deep, but the emotions kind of soften.\" \n \n A whale funeral \n \n That's exactly what Atkinson believes the whales are doing with the calf \u2014 holding their own version of a wake or a funeral. \n \n \"Ceremonies can go on for days to honour and mourn the loss of a loved one,\" she said. \"I think that what you're seeing is the depth of importance of this calf and the grief of the mother and the family.\" \n \n This July 25 photo shows the orca mother, J35, balancing her dead baby on her nose trying to keep it afloat. (Ken Balcomb/Centre for Whale Research) \n \n Anthropologist Barbara King, who studies animal emotion, agrees the whale's behaviour is likely a display of grief. \n \n There is a body of evidence that shows whales and dolphins mark the passing of their dead, King told CBC's On The Coast. \n \n Sometimes they will surround dead companions, showing curiosity or exploration, King said. Other times, it goes further: they keep vigils around the bodies of dead podmates or keep them afloat. \n \n \"It's not anthropomorphic to use this label for them,\" King said. \"Grief and love are not human qualities. They're things we share with some other animals.\" \n \n Population in crisis \n \n The southern resident killer whale population consists of three orca pods that live around the coast of Oregon, Washington and Vancouver Island. \n \n Their numbers are dwindling and they haven't have a successful birth since 2015. \n \n After the death of a 23-year-old orca June, the total number of southern resident killer whales is down to 75, the lowest it's been since the early '80s. The population has dropped by eight since 2016. \n \n This orca mother has been holding her dead calf afloat for more than a week in a \"heartbreaking\" ritual.<br><br>Read more at <a href=\"https://t.co/LPrUsQCzDj\">https://t.co/LPrUsQCzDj</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/FgsHnWrgTw\">pic.twitter.com/FgsHnWrgTw</a> \u2014@CBCNews \n \n Their decline is attributed largely to a lack of available chinook salmon, their primary food source. \n \n Researchers are already worried that another young whale in the pod \u2014 J-50 \u2014 could be the next to die. The four-year-old is becoming increasingly emaciated. \n \n \"I don't see how she can survive,\" Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research, told the Seattle Times. \n \n In May, Canada's federal government announced plans to cut the allowable catch of chinook by 25 to 35 per cent. \n \n In June, it announced further measures to help the endangered population, including reducing underwater vessel noise and better monitoring of pollution. \n \n Human empathy \n \n Atkinson said it's not hard to see why people have had such visceral reactions to images of J-35 and her calf. \n \n \"Watching what she's going through, most people have been through some level of grief and have had some situation that this touches, because they can understand losing a child, losing a calf, and how heart-wrenching that is,\" she said. \n \n \"And then not to be able to do anything when humans like to take action.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 An orca who spent more than a week carrying her calf following its July 24 death now has some help. Other orcas in the pod swimming through Pacific Northwest waters near the US-Canada border are taking turns carrying the corpse after the effort caused the 20-year-old mother known as J35 to fall behind with labored breathing. Trailing the main pod with improved breathing, J35 was seen with the now-decomposing corpse Thursday in the Strait of Juan de Fuca alongside immediate family members who are keeping her fed, per KCPQ. But \"because we've seen her so many times without the calf, we know that somebody else has it,\" Jenny Atkinson of San Juan Island's Whale Museum tells the CBC. The same pod held a similar display 15 years ago, but this is the longest period of orca mourning on record, per National Geographic. Audio recordings indeed suggest the pod is using calls and whistles perhaps related to mourning. They sound \"more like a very urgent call,\" says Atkinson. \"I think that what you're seeing is the depth of importance of this calf and the grief of the mother and the family.\" It's a tight-knit one: There are just 75 orcas in three pods in the southern resident population around Oregon, Washington, and Vancouver Island, down from 83 in 2016. None have seen a successful birth since 2015. Amid indications a 4-year-old orca might be starving, an expert describes \"at most five more years\" in which to try to birth viable offspring. Declines in Chinook salmon have hit the population hard, per Nat Geo. Canada hopes to lend a hand by limiting catches of the fish, while experts hope a necropsy will reveal how J35's calf died, per CTV News. Of course, it must be abandoned first.",
    "generated_summary": "An orca named J35 has finally dropped her dead calf, which she'd been pushing with her head for at least 17 days and 1,000 miles. The sad spectacle was a prime example, and confirmation, of the complex emotional lives of these sophisticated cetaceans, experts say. Researchers worried that this \"tour of grief\" might seriously endanger the health of J35, but luckily, she appears to have made it through physically unharmed. The death of another calf is a significant blow to J Pod, which hasn\u2019t seen a successful birth in three years, and time is running out to maintain its viability.",

She's really interested in graphic novels.\"Cobain was intrigued by Palmer and fellow musician Jason Webley's concept for the album, Evelyn Evelyn, which focuses on twin singer-songwriter duo. Palmer was impressed with Cobain for more than her singing.\"She's really smart, level-headed, motivated, and incredibly funny,\" says Palmer, who met Cobain for the first time while with her fianc\u00e9, graphic novelist Neil Gaiman, of which Cobain is a fan. \"She has her own really strong personal work ethic and she wants to find her own voice and make her own art and she's going to do it by playing by her own rules.\"Cobain's voice was mixed into a chorus with those of \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, Tegan and Sara and Gerard Way from My Chemical Romance. \"We wanted to have a list of really random people on it as a joke,\" explains Palmer. The album dropped Tuesday. ||||| \n \n \n \n Evelyn Evelyn Evelyn Evelyn 11/8ft \n \n Web Exclusive \n \n Somewhere deep in the untamed wilds of MySpace, producers Amanda Palmer and Jason Webley discovered Evelyn Evelyn Neville\u2014a pair of conjoined twins sharing three legs, two arms, three lungs, two hearts, and a single liver. Isolated in a hotel in Walla Walla Washington, the girls developed their obsession with The Andrews Sisters and Joy Divison into a series of lovingly executed ukulele covers. Or so the story goes. I hate to point fingers, but certainly one of twins (as Webley himself pointed out in a blog entry) \"has a conspicuously deep voice for a 24-year-old girl.\" Shockingly, the other Evelyn sounds like a missing member of another punk cabaret twosome. Chalk it up to serendipity. \n \n Webley and Palmer, conjoined-Martha Stewarts of the theatrically macabre, frame Evelyn and Evelyn's album through a series of spoken word segments, where the sisters recount their picaresque tale of woe\u2014a tale that includes flying chickens, sexual abuse, societal marginalization, circus freaks, conjoined elephants, and social networking. Despite such obviously campy origins, the sisters' music often manages to rise above mere spectacle, their back-story flavoring oddball tracks such as \"Chicken Man\" and \"Elephant Elephant\" with surprising gravity, elevating the songs above mere musical curiosity. \n \n Of course it doesn't hurt that the girls are fair musicians in their own right. \"Have You Seen My Sister Evelyn\" is a straight-up cabaret gem, and opening track \"Evelyn Evelyn\" could fit as a bonus cut on 2008's Who Killed Amanda Palmer. The genre-hopping, which the sisters brag about early on, is often jarring\u2014but Palmer and Webley assure their prot\u00e9g\u00e9es acquit themselves nicely on country-tinged \"You Only Want Me 'Cause You Want My Sister\" and the '80s cheese of \"My Space.\" Much has been made about the host of cameos\u2014including Frances Bean Cobain, Andrew WK, and Tegan and Sara\u2014but negated to the role of chorus it's impossible to pick out individual voices. However, the additional star power isn't needed. Closing the album with a stripped-down version of Joy Division's \"Love Will Tear Us Apart,\" Evelyn and Evelyn prove that with or without their friends, they've got personality to spare. (www.evelynevelyn.com) \n \n Author rating: 7/10 ||||| As an admirer of both the work of Amanda Palmer and Jason Webley, I've really been looking forward to this project. The premise is a little confusing- Evelyn Evelyn are a fictional set of conjoined twin sisters (Eva and Lyn Neville) played by Palmer and Webley. The record is the story of Eva and Lyn, intermixed with Andrews Sisters style numbers. It is not unlike listening to a Broadway musical soundtrack, with three tracks devoted to the narration of the sisters' tragic life. \n \n After a few listens, I found myself immersed in the sad and strange world of the Neville sisters. The tale is compelling and the emotion and expression of the songs draws you in, from the show-tune style \"Have You Seen My Sister Evelyn?\" to the folky \"You Only Want Me 'Cause You Want My Sister,\" to the power ballad \"My Space\" (which is indeed about MySpace, which features an impressive guest line up. \n \n Webley and Palmer are in top form. The vocals are impressive and poignant. One of my favorite parts of the album is the closing track, a cover of Joy Division's \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\", one of my favorite songs of all time. Evelyn Evelyn's version is stripped down to just Palmer and Webley trading broken down vocals over soft ukulele accompaniment. \n \n If you haven't already gotten the impression, this album is eccentric. It isn't going to be for everyone, like Webley and Palmer's solo work. However, those who give this project the chance and time will appreciate it immensely. \n \n \n \n Evelyn Evelyn - Have You Seen My Sister Evelyn? \n \n Evelyn Evelyn will be released on 11 Records on March 30th.",

He conceded that Rosier's crimes were serious, \"but when you look at the range of punishments available, that's why they call it juvenile.\" Ultimately, Rosier's sentence resulted from convictions on three felony counts: cruelty to animals with a firearm, burglary of a dwelling with a firearm, and shooting into a building. \"A gun in a 16-year-old's hand can do equally the damage as a gun in an adult's hand,\" said the prosecuting attorney. \"He's not a child.\" The trooper, Boody, cried when testifying about how he came home to find his dog crippled by gunshot wounds.

    "document": "Old Rag is Shenandoah's most popular and most dangerous hike. The number of blogs and websites about this hike attests to its popularity. The number of search and rescue missions each year attests to its danger. There's no doubt that the scramble is great fun and the views are spectacular. A day on Old Rag is one of Shenandoah's premier experiences. We want to be sure that your experience is not marred by an accident or health issue that could be prevented with good planning. \n \n \n \n \n \n Old Rag Mountain Safety Video (object placeholder) Planning Your Visit The most important step to a great hiking experience in Shenandoah National Park is good planning. Many of the points below are applicable to any hike, but there are a few special considerations for Old Rag. Be sure that you are physically able to complete this hike. The circuit hike is about 9 miles. There is a significant elevation change and a strenuous rock scramble that requires good upper body strength. Often, children and shorter adults need assistance navigating the scramble. \n \n Take at least 2 quarts of water per person. Dehydration is one of the most prevalent issues. \n \n Wear sturdy shoes that will support your ankles and allow you to to get a foothold without slipping. \n \n Allow 7 or 8 hours. Yes, people do it in less time but, like all types of travel, you may experience unanticipated delays. It's always a good idea to have a headlamp in case you don't complete your hike before dark. \n \n Be sure you know the forecast and never attempt this hike in wet or icy conditions. \n \n Stay with your group and stay on the trail. Do not allow children to run ahead. \n \n Although you need to be sure you have plenty of water and food, it is a good idea to pack as lightly as possible. Most hikers prefer fanny packs to backpacks which can be difficult to maneuver through the rock scramble. \n \n Planning your hike on a weekday will enhance your experience. Old Rag can become very crowded on weekends. At times, the parking lot will be full and there will be long lines and substantial waits at some of the narrow passages. For current conditions follow us on Twitter: ShenandoahNPS. \n \n Pets are strictly forbidden on Old Rag for their own and hikers' safety. Directions Although Old Rag Mountain is within the boundaries of Shenandoah National Park, most people approach it from the park's eastern boundary. Follow these directions to get to the trailhead: From Sperryville, Route 211: Take Route 522 south for .8 mile. Turn right onto Route 231 and go 8 miles. Turn right onto Route 601 and follow the signs to the parking area (approximately 3 miles). \n \n From Madison, Route 29 Business: TakeRoute 231 for 12.8 miles. Turn left onto Route 602 and follow the signs to the parking area (approximately 3 miles). Parking Especially during busy weekends, parking can be another challenge. All Old Rag hikers must use the large parking area at the Old Rag Fee Station. The small parking area at the Old Rag Trailhead is NOT open to the public. Parking at the lot at the fee station is free. You are required to purchase an entrance permit. Landowners with property adjacent to the Park are charging a fee for parking on their property. Paying a private citizen to park does not affect the entrance fee. Be sure to check the Shenandoah lot for availability before paying to park. \n \n \n \n In an effort to make the Old Rag experience safer, we have increased patrols so the trailhead lot will be reserved for Old Rag staff including Search and Rescue personnel, park staff, trail overseers, and Old Rag Mountain Stewards. The parking lot is about a .8 mile walk along the road to the trailhead \n \n \n \n Parking is prohibited along the road shoulders. Please use the lot to avoid being towed. Fees Visitors hiking Old Rag must have a valid Shenandoah National Park entrance permit. You can purchase permits and yearly passes from Rangers when present, or via self-pay at the Old Rag Fee Station. Please note: We cannot accept pre-loaded gift cards. Learn more about Shenandoah's fees. Overnight Camping in the Old Rag Area Legal overnight camping sites are very limited in the Old Rag area. Camping is prohibited above 2,800'. If you want to make your trip an overnight one, you'll need a Backcountry Camping permit and you'll need to study a map of the area to choose a site. Visit our Backcountry Trip Planning pages for more information. Study the suggested trips for the Old Rag, Corbin Hollow, and Nicholson Hollow areas.

    "document": "Scientist releases guide to surviving a nuclear bomb in your city \n \n By Agence France-Presse \n \n Tuesday, January 14, 2014 20:51 EDT \n \n A scientist published a guide Wednesday to help authorities limit deaths from fallout after a city is hit by a nuclear bomb. \n \n Taking cover in existing buildings is widely accepted as a critical first action after a nuclear blast in a major city. \n \n But how long people should stay there before moving to better shelter is a more complex question. \n \n Buildings that are lightweight or lack a basement are more easily penetrated by radioactive dust. \n \n Writing in a British scientific journal, Michael Dillon of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, has now come up with a mathematical model for the \u201coptimal shelter exit time\u201d to minimise radiation risk. \n \n Based on his calculations, if adequate shelter is 15 minutes away, individuals should remain in their initial, poor-quality shelter no longer than 30 minutes after detonation. \n \n If, however, the better shelter is only five minutes away, individuals should move there immediately and forego the closer but unsafe buildings altogether, he wrote. \n \n Reaching adequate shelter rapidly could save between 10,000 and 100,000 individuals from fatal exposure in the event of a single, low-yield detonation, said the study published in Proceedings of the Royal Society A. \n \n \u201cThese methods are intended to assist emergency planning officials in the development of an optimal low-yield nuclear detonation response strategy,\u201d wrote Dillon. \n \n A low-yield blast is described as 0.1-10 kilotons. \n \n One kiloton (kT) is an explosive force equivalent to that of 1,000 metric tons of TNT. The US bomb that killed more than 200,000 people in Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945 was about 15 kT. \n \n More than a fifth of American households lack basements or are considered too lightweight to offer shelter in the fallout phase of the emergency, the study said. \n \n [Image via Agence France-Presse] ||||| People living within about 20 miles (32 kilometers) of a small-scale nuclear attack have up to half an hour to seek out adequate shelter safely, as long as travel time to that shelter is no more than 15 minutes away, according to a recent report on the optimal escape strategies for small-scale nuclear explosions. \n \n The threats of catastrophic Cold War-style nuclear bombs have subsided since international agreements like the 1970 Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons have taken hold to protect society from the annihilative attacks that flattened Hiroshima and Nagaski, in Japan, during World War II. \n \n Still, the threat of smaller-scale nuclear attacks with explosive energy orders of magnitude less intense has increased in recent years as the technology to build such weapons has become more prevalent. These smaller-scale detonations may not be strong enough to flatten cities, but they do produce harmful radioactive fallout that residents must avoid to reduce the nauseating effects of radiation poisoning and longer-term risks of cancer. [The Top 10 Largest Explosions Ever] \n \n The best way to protect against the radioactive dust and ash of nuclear fallout is to seek shelter underground, but more than 20 percent of U.S. households do not have basements, according to a 2009 survey from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Those people without basements must therefore decide when and how far to travel in search of higher-quality shelter in the event of an attack. \n \n To help simplify this decision process, Michael Dillon of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, Calif., conducted mathematical analyses based on existing data on the threats induced by small-scale nuclear explosions to streamline rules people can abide by to protect themselves from fallout. \n \n \"The principle is trying to figure out the least amount of information you need to make your decisions as fast as possible,\" Dillon told LiveScience. \"In these sorts of situations, you don't have a lot of time, and you need to quickly know what you are looking for to make these decisions.\" \n \n The first order of business is to determine the quality of shelter that one has immediate access to at the time of an attack. Underground concrete shelters are best, as they put the largest amount of mass between a person and fallout, but the core of large buildings \u2014 such as large offices or schools \u2014 can also provide adequate shelter, Dillon said. Thin-walled homes, on the other hand, made of wood or other flimsy materials are considered poor-quality shelters. \n \n Through his analyses, Dillon determined that people within poor-quality shelters can reduce radiation poisoning by staying within those shelters for only up to 30 minutes after the detonation before seeking out adequate shelter, as long as that shelter is reachable within 15 minutes. However, if adequate shelter is reachable within five minutes, then residents should pick up and go to that shelter immediately after a detonation. \n \n People do not need to do much to protect themselves against radiation while in transit, since the fallout can largely be rinsed off once a person seeks refuge. The only thing a person really needs, Dillon half-joked, is a good pair of sneakers that allows them to travel quickly, if they are traveling by foot. \n \n If traveling by car, people must take traffic into consideration when planning their escape strategies, Dillon said, pointing out that his results provide only one piece of a larger response strategy that can become more complicated by unpredictable factors such as traffic flow. \n \n Dillon is working to assess the distribution of adequate shelters across the United States, and says that his preliminary results suggest that, as a whole, the country is well equipped with adequate shelters within 15 minutes of many households. These analyses are still in the works, however, and are not yet conclusive, he said. \n \n The complete report is detailed today (Jan. 14) in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society A. \n \n Follow Laura Poppick on Twitter.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Good news: A mathematical model has been created that could help save your life in the event that your city is hit by a nuclear bomb. Scientist Michael Dillon's model, published Tuesday, is about reducing radiation risk from the bomb's fallout, and calculates \"optimal shelter exit time.\" The longstanding advice has been to immediately seek shelter, ideally underground, if a bomb hits. But there is better and worse shelter\u2014the latter being \"lightweight\" buildings (such as ones made of wood) or ones without basements; the AFP reports more than 20% of US homes fall into the worse category. Here is Dillon's determination for people living within 20 miles of a low-yield nuclear blast, meaning one a bit smaller than Hiroshima: If it would take five minutes or less to reach better shelter (that concrete basement, or the center of a large building, like a big office, reports LiveScience), bypass the more immediate shelter and go there straight away. If better shelter is 15 minutes away, stay in the worse shelter for up to 30 minutes, then head out. As for the transit period, don't waste time worrying about protecting your body from the radiation, he says, which can mostly be rinsed off once you get to your shelter. The findings are actually intended for emergency planning officials, who can make use of the findings when designing \"an optimal low-yield nuclear detonation response strategy,\" writes Dillon, who works at California's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.",

    "document": "CONSIDERING OPTIONS: There's a chance Murkowski could run as a Libertarian if Miller beats her. \n \n The Alaska Division of Elections said Thursday that it has more than 20,000 absentee and questioned ballots left to process from Tuesday's primary election. Most are expected to be Republican primary ballots that will decide the too-close-to-call race between U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Joe Miller. \n \n Miller is currently leading Murkowski by 1,668 votes. \n \n Elections officials on Thursday evening released the first detailed breakdown of the remaining ballots. \n \n The state has received back 11,266 absentee ballots so far out of over 16,000 requested. The ballots had to be postmarked by Tuesday's election but can come in as much as 15 days afterward. \n \n There are also 658 early votes not yet counted and 8,972 questioned ballots. A ballot can be \"questioned\" for several reasons. Often the reason is that the voter cast the ballot in a precinct other than where they live. \n \n Miller said in a Thursday interview that he expects to maintain his lead with the help of military absentee voters. He also said Murkowski shouldn't think about a third-party candidacy or an independent write-in effort if she loses in the primary. \n \n \"If Sen. Murkowski is going to keep her word, she's going to get out -- if the voters decide that in fact I prevail in this primary election. She said at the Kenai forum on Friday that she would respect the will of the Alaskan voter and we're going to hold her to it,\" Miller said by phone from Fairbanks. \n \n Murkowski campaign manager John Bitney responded that Murkowski was focused on the ballots that are left to be counted and \"any speculation about anything else is absolutely premature.\" \n \n There is a possibility that Murkowski could run on the Libertarian ticket in the November general election if she loses the Republican primary. The Alaska Libertarian Party is discussing the possibility and its Senate candidate, David Haase, has said he is open to talking to Murkowski about him stepping aside. \n \n Andrew Halcro, a Murkowski supporter who served with her in the state Legislature, called Haase on Wednesday and discussed the possibility. Halcro said he was acting on his own and not coordinating with the Murkowski campaign. \n \n Halcro said he did bring it up with Murkowski on Thursday morning. \"She said what she's told (the media), that she's considering all the options,\" he said. \n \n Halcro said he thinks Murkowski should pursue the Libertarian route if she doesn't win the primary. She has the campaign cash left and a network in place to run a strong statewide campaign, he said. \n \n THREE MORE COUNTS \n \n The Division of Elections isn't saying how many of the ballots left to count are for the Republican primary and how many are for the Democratic primary. \n \n But three times more Republican than Democratic ballots were cast on Election Day in the Senate race. Murkowski campaign manager Bitney watched absentees being sorted at the Division of Elections Thursday and said a \"very, very high percentage\" of them were Republican. \n \n Anchorage attorney Tom Van Flein was at the Division of Elections observing for the Miller campaign. \n \n Van Flein is best known as the personal lawyer for Sarah Palin, who endorsed Miller. \n \n The Division of Elections plans to count all the absentee ballots on Aug. 31 that it has received by then. Some of the questioned ballots will be disqualified; for example if it turns out the voter really wasn't registered in Alaska. Those that are valid will likely be counted on Sept. 3. Elections officials said they'll do a final count of absentees and any other remaining ballots on Sept. 8. \n \n The number of remaining ballots changes daily as more absentees come in and there's no way to know how many will be disqualified. But if all the current number of 20,896 remaining ballots were counted and three-fourths of them voted in the Republican Senate primary, Murkowski would need the vote on roughly 55 percent to win. \n \n NATIONAL ATTENTION \n \n Both sides are keeping close watch. The Washington Post cited unnamed sources in reporting Thursday that the National Republican Senatorial Committee will be sending lawyer Sean Cairncross to assist Murkowski's campaign during the ballot count. It's not clear what his role will be, but Miller called it questionable. \n \n \"We're just hoping that the lawyering up that's going on with the National Republican Senatorial Committee isn't going to be resulting in any improper meddling in our primary,\" Miller said. \n \n Miller said he's beating Murkowski because of his volunteer network and \"common sense message.\" \n \n \"Alaskans are common sense folk, they recognize our nation is at a bankrupt position right now,\" he said. \n \n Murkowski campaign manager Bitney said people should remember \"he hasn't won yet.\" ||||| Joe Miller, the Republican candidate who is poised to knock off Sen. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) in a primary contest, said Thursday he is concerned she will launch a protracted legal battle to save her seat. \n \n Miller, an Iraq war veteran who received the backing of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R), emerged from the election Tuesday night with a narrow lead over Murkowski, an incumbent who assumed the seat from her father. \n \n \n \n But officials are still counting absentee ballots in the close race, and a lawyer for the GOP Senate campaign committee is heading to Alaska to assist the senator. \n \n \n \n ADVERTISEMENT \n \n \"We are looking right now to make sure that the election \u2014 that the votes \u2014 are accounted for fairly, without any type of game play,\" Miller said in an interview on Fox Business Network. \"It concerns us any time somebody lawyers up and tries to pull an Al Franken, if you will. We are very concerned that there may be some attempt here to skew the results.\" \n \n Alaska officials will start counting absentee ballots next Tuesday, but observers expect a protracted process to determine the winner. \n \n Miller was referring to the 2008 Minnesota Senate contest that pitted now-Sen. Al Franken (D) against then-Sen. Norm Coleman (R). Coleman's razor-thin lead the morning after election night triggered an automatic recount that resulted in an eight-month legal battle. \n \n The candidate expressed concern specifically about the lawyer sent to help Murkowski. \n \n \n \n \"You know we are concerned,\" he said. \"We\u2019ve got, I think, some game play going on here with the national Republican Senatorial Committee meddling in our primary election.\u201d \n \n \n \n Democrats have pounced on the election results, painting them as an example of GOP infighting that could do in the party in the November midterms. \n \n \n \n They have also portrayed the election as another potential victory for a Tea Party-backed candidate, a group which Democrats have said is outside the mainstream. \n \n The primary campaign was contentious and drew national attention in its final days due to Palin's involvement. Murkowski was critical of Palin for writing a Facebook note calling her part of the problem in Washington and referencing the fact that she was appointed to the seat by her father, then-Gov.

    "document": "Standing on their own four feet: New research shows why cats are more independent than dogs \n \n Domestic cats do not generally see their owners as a focus of safety and security in the same way that dogs do, according to new research published today.The study by animal behaviour specialists at the University of Lincoln, UK, shows that while dogs perceive their owners as a safe base, the relationship between people and their feline friends appears to be quite different.While it is increasingly recognised that cats are more social and more capable of shared relationships than traditionally thought, this latest research shows that adult cats appear to be more autonomous \u2013 even in their social relationships \u2013 and not necessarily dependent on others to provide a sense of protection.The research, published in the scientific journal PLOS ONE, was led by Professor Daniel Mills , Professor of Veterinary Behavioural Medicine at the University of Lincoln\u2019s School of Life Sciences , along with Alice Potter \u2013 who studied as a postgraduate at Lincoln and now works with the Companion Animals Science Group at the RSPCA.Professor Mills said: \u201cThe domestic cat has recently passed the dog as the most popular companion animal in Europe, with many seeing a cat as an ideal pet for owners who work long hours. Previous research has suggested that some cats show signs of separation anxiety when left alone by their owners, in the same way that dogs do, but the results of our study show that they are in fact much more independent than canine companions. It seems that what we interpret as separation anxiety might actually be signs of frustration.\u201dThe Lincoln researchers carefully adapted the Ainsworth Strange Situation Test (SST), which has been widely used to demonstrate that the bond between young children or pet dogs with their primary carer can be categorised as a \u2018secure attachment\u2019 \u2013 where the carer is seen as a focus of safety and security in potentially threatening (or unfamiliar) environments.The study observed the relationships between a number of cats and their owners, placing the pets in an unfamiliar environment together with their owner, with a stranger and also on their own. In varying scenarios, it assessed three different characteristics of attachment; the amount of contact sought by the cat, the level of passive behaviour, and signs of distress caused by the absence of the owner.\u201cAlthough our cats were more vocal when the owner rather than the stranger left them with the other individual, we didn\u2019t see any additional evidence to suggest that the bond between a cat and its owner is one of secure attachment. This vocalisation might simply be a sign of frustration or learned response, since no other signs of attachment were reliably seen. In strange situations, attached individuals seek to stay close to their carer, show signs of distress when they are separated and demonstrate pleasure when their attachment figure returns, but these trends weren\u2019t apparent during our research,\u201d said Professor Mills.\u201cFor pet dogs, their owners often represent a specific safe haven; however it is clear that domestic cats are much more autonomous when it comes to coping with unusual situations. Our findings don\u2019t disagree with the notion that cats develop social preferences or close relationships, but they do show that these relationships do not appear to be typically based on a need for safety and security. As far as we could tell, the cats of owners who considered them to be highly attached did not differ from the others in this regard.\u201dThe results of the study reveal that while cats might prefer to interact with their owner, they do not rely on them for reassurance when in an unfamiliar environment, and the researchers believe this is because of the nature of the species as a largely independent and solitary hunter.The paper is now available to view online: http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0135109 ||||| The Ainsworth Strange Situation Test (SST) has been widely used to demonstrate that the bond between both children and dogs to their primary carer typically meets the requirements of a secure attachment (i.e. the carer being perceived as a focus of safety and security in otherwise threatening environments), and has been adapted for cats with a similar claim made. However methodological problems in this latter research make the claim that the cat-owner bond is typically a secure attachment, operationally definable by its behaviour in the SST, questionable. We therefore developed an adapted version of the SST with the necessary methodological controls which include a full counterbalance of the procedure. A cross-over design experiment with 20 cat-owner pairs (10 each undertaking one of the two versions of the SST first) and continuous focal sampling was used to record the duration of a range of behavioural states expressed by the cats that might be useful for assessing secure attachment. Since data were not normally distributed, non-parametric analyses were used on those behaviours shown to be reliable across the two versions of the test (which excluded much cat behaviour). Although cats vocalised more when the owner rather the stranger left the cat with the other individual, there was no other evidence consistent with the interpretation of the bond between a cat and its owner meeting the requirements of a secure attachment. These results are consistent with the view that adult cats are typically quite autonomous, even in their social relationships, and not necessarily dependent on others to provide a sense of security and safety. It is concluded that alternative methods need to be developed to characterise the normal psychological features of the cat-owner bond. \n \n The extent to which cats demonstrate sociality towards humans appears to be influenced by a wide range of factors [ 30 ], [ 31 ]. Kittens are reported to have a sensitive phase of socialisation towards humans between their second and seventh week of life [ 32 ]. During this time exposure to humans, amount of handling, number of handlers and presence of the queen have all been found to influence sociality towards humans [ 32 ], [ 33 ]. A range of human-related factors also influence the development of the social behaviour expressed by cats towards people [ 34 ], [ 35 ]. Given these findings and the tendency of owners to consider pet cats as part of the family [ 36 ], it seems reasonable to examine whether the typical bond shown by pet cats towards their owners also involves a form of secure attachment that provides additional safety and security. Using a modified version of the Ainsworth SST, Edwards et al., [ 7 ] have claimed, on the basis of a preliminary study, that this is indeed the case. They reported that cats only played in the presence of their owner, vocalised more when left alone, engaged in more locomotion/exploration while the owner was present and were more alert in the presence of the stranger [ 7 ]. However their conclusion that their use of a modified SST demonstrates that the cat-owner bond typically meets the requirements of a secure attachment is questionable on several grounds, due to methodological flaws in their study, which might account for the differences observed. Firstly, the experience of the cat within the procedure in relation to the owner and stranger was not equivalent. For example when analysing the cats\u2019 behaviour towards the owners, Edwards et al., [ 7 ] use data from two episodes within the test, neither of which follow an episode of the cat being alone, whereas the assessment of the cats\u2019 behaviour towards the strangers depends on only one episode which follows an episode of isolation. The different conditions applied to the cats in the time preceding the episode when it is alone with the owner and stranger, may therefore explain differences in the cats\u2019 behaviour towards these individuals rather than the relationship the cat has with each of them. Secondly, Edwards et al., [ 7 ] also fail to control for a possible episode-order effect. Episode-order describes the sequence in which the owner and stranger participate in the procedure and this has the potential to affect the cat\u2019s behaviour, as the cat may alter its behaviour in relation to the strange situation over time, regardless of who is present. The use of a counterbalanced procedure in which the sequence is reversed for half of the subjects can control for this potential confound [ 18 ]. Thirdly, Edwards et al., [ 7 ] did not analyse the data from all episodes, but only four of them (episodes 4\u20137). This meant their data came from 6 minutes of observation of the cat with the owner, 3 minutes with the stranger and 3 minutes when the cat was alone. This again confounds the ability to ascribe differences in behaviour towards the two types of human subject involved in the test to the relationship, rather than to the methodological features of the study. Finally, it is also assumed by Edwards et al., [ 7 ] that the cat behaviour observed is reliable, (i.e. that a given cat would consistently show this type of response in this type of situation); given the large number of variables assessed, spurious findings due to Type I statistical errors are a risk. Therefore the study reported here re-examined the issue of secure attachment by cats to their carers, in a way that addresses these concerns by using a cross over design experiment with an improved and counterbalanced modification of the Ainsworth SST. Our first aim was to assess the robustness of potential measures of cat attachment within the SST; our second aim was to assess whether those behaviours found to be suitably robust and relevant indicate that the cat-owner relationship meets the requirements of a secure attachment as defined within the SST. \n \n The domestic cat (Felis silvestris catus) has recently passed the dog as the most popular companion animal within Europe [ 1 ], [ 2 ]. Ease of care, ability to live in a small residence and the capacity to cope with being left alone for long periods of time have been reported as reasons for this popularity [ 1 ], [ 3 ], [ 4 ], [ 5 ]. Indeed, some have suggested that cats are \u2018ideal\u2019 companions for owners who work long hours [ 5 ]. However, there is evidence to indicate that some cats may show signs of separation distress in the absence of their owner [ 6 ] and it has been suggested that the cat-owner bond may be a form of attachment similar to that which exists between a dog or child and its primary carer [ 7 ]. Bowlby [ 8 ] [ 9 ] described attachment as an enduring psychological bond, that serves to improve an infant\u2019s chances of survival by keeping it close to its mother. In this context the term \u201cattachment\u201d has a precise operational definition relating to the provision of safety and security, and is not simply an affectionate bond; it has several objectively definable characteristics: attached individuals seek to maintain proximity and contact with the attachment figure, attached individuals become distressed when involuntarily separated and show signs of pleasure upon their return, attachment figures act as a safe haven to which the attached individual will return when frightened by the environment, attachment figures act as a secure-base from which the attached individual can move off and engage confidently in activities [ 10 ]. None of these alone is sufficient to demonstrate or infer secure attachment, but many of these features are assessed within the Strange Situation Test (SST) developed by Ainsworth [ 11 ] for this purpose. The procedure involves placing a subject in an unfamiliar room (strange situation\u2013to provoke a sense of insecurity) together with its carer (potential attachment figure) and a stranger (social control to which there should be no attachment) followed by a series of episodes of separation from, and reunions with, their carer and the stranger. The normal healthy response in this context involves a differentiation between the carer and the stranger in the support they provide to the subject in this challenging environment. This can be used to imply the type of attachment that exists between the subject and care. In this way a secure attachment style can be operationally defined; other styles of response are considered problematic [ 11 ]. The test was originally developed to investigate mother\u2013infant attachment, but has been used and adapted for studying attachment between other species and their carers e.g. chimpanzees [ 12 ], dogs [ 13 ],[ 14 ], [ 15 ], [ 16 ], [ 17 ], [ 18 ], [ 19 ], [ 20 ] and hand-reared wolves [ 17 ]. Its application to dogs was inspired by the resemblance of the dog-owner bond to that which exists between a child and parent [ 13 ], [ 14 ] and there is now strong evidence to indicate that the typical dog-human bond also includes the requirements of a secure attachment defined in this way [ 18 ]. The well-developed sociality of dogs may be particularly important in this regard [ 14 ]. Nonetheless both cats and dogs appear to show separation related problems, which it has been suggested might be associated with attachment to owners [ 21 ] and it is increasingly recognised that cats (Felis sylvestris catus) are perhaps more social than traditionally thought even with their own species [ 22 ], [ 23 ], [ 24 ], [ 25 ], [ 26 ], [ 27 ], [ 28 ], [ 29 ]. Co-operative colonies of related females arising as a result of the availability of key resources are well documented [ 24 ], [ 25 ], but even male cats, especially those neutered, are known to be social [ 28 ]. Preferred associates may be identified from affiliative behaviours such as allorubbing and allogrooming [ 22 ] and this type of activity may be used to assess the social bond that exists between the individuals involved [ 26 ]. It is therefore clear that cats have the capacity to form social intraspecific relationships, and this may underpin the form of relationship they form with humans, especially those with whom they share a home. \n \n In the first instance it was important to establish the reliability of the behaviour that had the potential to be used to assess attachment by cats. The counterbalancing of the procedure and within subjects design of the experiment, meant that it was possible to systematically analyse the data to detect significant differences in the behaviour within subjects in the same circumstances but at different times. This allowed a rigorous assessment of the robustness of each potential measure, using the following process. Comparable measures of behaviour based on either single episodes (e.g. vocalising during A2 versus B6) or combinations of episode (e.g. vocalising in the two episodes A2 and A8 versus B6 and B4) were identified (see S2 File for a full list). Next, in accordance with Jones and Kenward (2003) [ 38 ], the occurrence of a significant interaction between the order in which subjects were tested (test-order) and the condition on a given behaviour was examined first using a Mann-Whitney test. Only if there was no significant interaction could the behaviour be taken forward for further consideration as a potentially useful measure. The next stage of analysis examined if there was a significant test-order effect on the given behaviour. If a significant test-order effect was found then that behaviour could not be used in any analysis of attachment between the two conditions (A versus B). Next, because each social situation was replicated within a condition, the significance of any episode-order effect on the behaviour was examined (i.e. the effect of time within a test). If a significant episode-order effect was found then that behaviour could not be used in any analysis of the behaviour within episodes occurring at a different time but within the same condition. If the behaviour was affected by both test-order effect and episode order then it could not be used as a potential measure to assess attachment. Only behaviour measures that did not meet any of these exclusion criteria were robust enough to assess whether the cats showed signs of attachment in the modified SST. \n \n Following a pilot study and review of previous research [ 7 ], a list of behaviours was drawn up for recording (See S1 File ). Continuous focal sampling of video recordings of the cat\u2019s behaviour was undertaken using Solomon Coder (Beta 12.07.10) to record the duration of these behaviours [ 37 ] during each episode of each condition. In order to minimise the subsequent risk of error due to multiple statistical testing, some functionally related behavioural categories were grouped. Specifically \u2018passive exploration\u2019, \u2018active exploration\u2019 and \u2018locomotion\u2019 were grouped into \u2018exploration/locomotion\u2019 and \u2018approaching/orientation to a person\u2019 and \u2018following\u2019 were grouped into \u2018proximate owner/stranger\u2019. Behavioural measures were then classified a priori according to their putative relationship to one or more of the operationally definable characteristics of attachment, and only these measures considered for statistical analysis ( Table 2 ). Three characteristics of attachment (proximity/contact seeking, secure-base effect and distress due to separation) could be assessed. Firstly, the owner should be a preferred social companion to the stranger as evidenced by the cat seeking proximity and attempting to maintain proximity/contact more with the owner than with the stranger. Secondly, if the owner acts as a secure base, it was predicted that there should be more passive behaviour, exploration and social play in the presence of the owner compared to the presence of the stranger. Thirdly, cats should be more distressed by the absence of the owner than the stranger, and so it was predicted that cats should vocalise more when separated from the owner compared to the stranger, and show greater vigilance and orientation to the door when the owner is absent compared to the when the stranger is absent. No single measure would be sufficient to conclude that the relationship between the cat and its owner is a secure attachment, rather the evidence from all of these tests would need to be considered overall. \n \n All owner-cat pairs participated in both conditions (A and B) in different rooms set up for the procedure, and were tested within 5 minutes of arrival at the test site. Ten subjects were pseudo-randomly assigned to group 1 (condition A followed by condition B) and the other ten to group 2 (condition B followed by condition A). For all subjects a period of at least two weeks elapsed between participation in the two conditions. Two females of similar height, build and appearance were used as the stranger (one for each condition). Testing was conducted over a seven week period between May and July 2012. To accommodate the schedules of subjects the tests were conducted at a variety of times between 09:30 and 19:00 Monday to Sunday. On average tests on the same subject were conducted within an hour of the same time of day on the two occasions (mean difference 51.75 mins, mode = 0). \n \n The procedure comprised of two conditions: modified (A) and reversed modified (B) version of the Ainsworth SST both consisting of nine 3 minute episodes in which the cat is either alone or with the owner and/or a stranger in order to assess how it responds to a series of procedures designed to alter the level and form of social support available to it, or trigger seeking out of an attachment figure (see Table 1 for details of the procedures and \u201cData collection and analysis plan\u201d below for details of the specific predictions made in different circumstances if a cat is securely attached to its owner). Hereafter the convention of a letter followed by a number is used to refer to conditions and episodes as described in Table 1 . Hence, A2 refers to condition A episode 2. The Ainsworth SST was extended from six to nine episodes in order to allow the owner and stranger to take part in an equal number of episodes, separations and reunions with the cat subjects. As with the original Ainsworth procedure the duration of each episode was three minutes. In condition B the episode-order of condition A was reversed. This reversal of episode sequence balanced the order in which the owner and stranger participated in the procedure across the two tests ( Table 1 ). \n \n Two similar, plain rooms were used for the study ( Fig 1 ), in order to ensure an equivalent strange physical environment in each test. Test rooms were unfamiliar to all cat subjects. Both rooms were equipped with two chairs (for the owner and stranger), three cat toys (two balls and a string and rod toy) and a small area (approx. 80cm by 75cm by 35cm, with a partially occluded entrance) in which cats could hide. Windows in both rooms were covered to avoid any visual distraction from outside. Within both rooms a video camera (Flip Video Ultra HD) mounted on a tripod was set up to record the test period and a web camera connected through a live feed to a monitor located outside the test room was mounted above each doorway. The web camera allowed both the experimenter to follow the procedure and the owners to observe their cat during episodes in which they were not present. The rooms were divided by strips of white tape into four zones: i) region around owner\u2019s chair, ii) region around stranger\u2019s chair, iii) door, iv) play area ( Fig 1 ). In order to control for any effects of spatial location of owner, the owners were pseudo-randomly assigned to one of the two chairs available ( Fig 1 ) in the first test and then allocated the other chair in the repeat test. The test rooms and all equipment were thoroughly cleaned with an enzymatic cleaner (Urine-Off for Cats and Kittens) before and after each test to remove cat related odours, between tests. \n \n A convenience sample of twenty owner-cat dyads was recruited through personal contact and advertisements in local pet related businesses. All participants lived within 5 miles (8km) of the test area. Owners were all adults, with four males and 16 females agreeing to take part. A broad spectrum of ownership lifestyles were represented, with ten of the owners in full-time employment, 3 in part-time employment, 3 students and 2 unemployed. The cat subjects were 13 males and 7 females whose ages ranged between 1\u20139 years old (mean age \u00b1 SD; 5.05 years \u00b1 3.17). One female cat and all males had been neutered, and no entire female was in season. Two cats were pedigree British Shorthairs and the remaining 18 subjects were Domestic shorthairs (15) and Domestic longhairs (3). All cats had been in their current home for a minimum of ten months. Eleven of the cats lived with at least one other cat (range 1\u20134) and two lived with a dog in the home. Nineteen of the cats had regular access to the outside. All cats were free from either overt or known on-going medical conditions. All but one owner provided information relating to the experience of the cats of strange situations. Only two had much experience of strange situations away from the current owner, since being taken in by the current owner (having lived away from the owner for a period of time), eight were known to have moved home with the owner. All except one of the cats were used to being transported in a cat carrier. \n \n No interaction, test-order or episode-order effects were found for the measures \u2018exploration/locomotion\u2019 and \u2018social play\u2019 (with the owner or stranger) and therefore these parameters were used further to assess attachment. No significant differences were found in the duration of time cats spent expressing exploration/locomotion in the presence of the owner compared to the stranger ( Table 3 ). Likewise there were no significant differences in the duration of time cats spent playing with their owner compared to playing with the stranger. In addition there was no significant difference in the amount cats played with the stranger when the owner was present (A1) and when the owner was absent (A2 or A8) ( Table 3 ). \u2018Passive behaviours\u2019 exhibited episode-order effects (A2 vs B6, z = 368.5, p<0.05; A2+A8 vs B6+B4, z = 023.5, p<0.01) but no test order effects. Therefore this parameter was used to assess attachment only in comparisons of the same episode number between conditions. Cats spent significantly more time expressing passive behaviours in the sole presence of the stranger than the owner in one combination of episodes (A4+A6 vs B4+B6, Z = 68.5, N = 18, p\u22640.001), but not the other (A2+A8 vs B2+B8). This significant difference in passive behaviours is evident in both of the individual episode comparisons making up this combination i.e. between A4 and B4 after the cat has been left alone for the first time (Z = 2.0, N = 18, p\u22640.001) and between A6 and B6 \u2013the first departure in the second half of the test when (Z = 33.5, N = 18, p<0.05). \n \n \u2018Marking\u2019 behaviour exhibited an episode-order effect (A2+A8 vs B6+B4, z = 1107.5, p<0.05; A1 vs B5 [marking owner], z = 263.5, p<0.05; A1 vs B5 [marking stranger], z = 251.0, p<0.01), but no test-order effect and so these data were used in comparisons relating to the same episodes in the two conditions where relevant to the assessment of attachment. There was no significant difference in the amount cats marked the owner versus the stranger in the first episode of test A, but they marked the owner more than the stranger in the first episode of test B. Cats were found to mark the stranger significantly more than the owner when comparing the first separation (A2 vs B2) and first reunion after the cat was alone (A4 vs B4), with no significant difference, when both were present in episode 5 and following the second separation in the next episode(A6 vs B6), but significantly more marking was directed towards the owner than the stranger at the second reunion after the cat had been alone (A8 vs B8) (See Table 3 for statistical results). \n \n Full results from the assessment of behavioural reliability can be found in the S3 File , but in the following sections we consider further the value of the various behaviours that could potentially contribute to the assessment of different facets of attachment, starting with their robustness as potential psychometric measures. To be suitable, measures of the same situation should show no significant interaction between the order in which subjects were tested (test-order) and the condition. The occurrence of a significant test-order effect for the same situation within a condition does not preclude the use of that measure within a condition, but it does preclude its use for making comparisons between the conditions due to the order effect. Likewise, any evidence of a significant episode-order effect for the same situation within a condition precludes the use of that measure from any analysis of episodes occurring at different times within a condition, but does not preclude its use between comparable situations occurring at the same time in the two conditions. However, if both a test-order effect and an episode order-effect are present for the same measure when used in similar situations then that measure cannot be used to make any reliable inferences from the test. \n \n Discussion \n \n The aim of this study was to use a fully counterbalanced version of the Ainsworth Strange Situation procedure to explore the extent to which it can be used to infer that the cat-owner bond constitutes a secure attachment [9]. Overall, the response of the cats indicated that the test environment was generally adequate for invoking the typical scenario desired in the ASST for demonstration of a secure base effect. However the specific results indicate that many aspects of the behaviour of cats in this test are not consistent with the characteristics of attachment, for two main reasons. Firstly, relevant aspects of the behaviour of cats are not reliable enough to be used in an evaluation of attachment (i.e. aspects of the test produce unreliable data). Secondly, even among those measures which are temporally robust, the predictions are not met, except in the case of level of vocalisation if it is a proxy of distress, but this alone is not sufficient to imply secure attachment. The additional controls in the current study compared to the previous study [7], which sought to determine whether the cat-owner relationship constituted an attachment as described by Bowlby [8], [9] explains why we reject this hypothesis. Although, we accept it is possible, if unlikely, that the typical relationship between owners and their cats in Mexico is different to that which generally occurs between owners and their cats in the UK., or that there is a difference in the relationship between owners and cats kept indoors (which formed the population tested by Edwards et al., [7]), and cats with outdoor access (which made up the majority of our population). We do not reject that cats may have social preferences, nor that some cats might form this type of attachment in certain circumstances, nor do we wish to imply that cats do not form some form of affectionate social relationship or bond with their owners (a broader sense use of the term \u201cattachment\u201d), only that the relationship with the primary caregiver is not typically characterised by a preference for that individual based on them providing safety and security to the cat. An alternative explanation for these results might be that the modified SST used here is not an appropriate instrument for measuring attachment, and the finding that the behaviour of cats appears to be very variable (and unreliable across time) may have wider implications for those using behavioural assessments to evaluate cats, such as for rehoming. \n \n In relation to proximity/contact seeking, many measures were found not to be robust enough to be used to evaluate this aspect of attachment. However, the data for marking (in the form of body rubbing), which is a specific behaviour that inevitably results in proximity, were useable in this regard despite showing an episode order effect. The results show there was a shift in the focus of marking within a test. Earlier in the test (episodes 2 & 4), cats marked the stranger more than the owner in comparable situations but as the test progressed there was no preference (episode 6) and finally (episode 8) there was a preference for the owner. This suggests that marking preference per se is not indicative of attachment towards the individual being marked, although these results can be explained in another way. It has recently been suggested [39] that marking serves an important function in relation to emotional arousal, with unfamiliar but not overtly threatening objects initially being marked to reduce anxious arousal associated with the uncertainty of the situation, and familiar individuals marked to maintain the social relationship. This allows the efficient allocation of limited attentional capacity. This hypothesis builds on previous suggestions that the purpose of marking between cats is to exchange odours so they become familiarised with one another [23], [29], [40] and laboratory cats have been found to make more direct contacts with an unfamiliar person than with a familiar one [41]. These results are consistent with an expansion of the familiarisation hypothesis that includes a social preference for the owner, as described by Mills et al., [39]. Since the stranger is initially unfamiliar and non-threatening, when the cat is left alone with this individual for the first time (episode 2), due to the departure of the owner, it would be expected that the cat will mark the unfamiliar individual with whom it now finds itself. By contrast in the counterbalanced condition (B), the stranger has just left and the cat finds itself with its owner with whom it is already is familiar. Thus we would predict more marking of the stranger than owner in this episode. Episode 4 represents the first reunion with an individual after the cat has been alone and given the increased familiarity of the owner, the same prediction applies. However, as the test proceeds, the stranger is becoming increasingly familiar to the cat, to the point that by episode 6 the difference that existed in episode 2 is less apparent. Thus in episode 8, which follows the second occasion the cat has been left alone, there is now increased marking of the owner, perhaps because although the two may now both be familiar, the owner is a preferred social contact. Thus the evidence from proximity maintenance/ contact seeking by the cat in support of attachment towards its owner is weak. \n \n The secure-base effect is considered the primary factor in identifying an attachment [10], [42]. However no evidence was found to support the use of owners as a secure-base in the current study. No significant difference was found in the amount of exploration/locomotion in the presence of the owner versus stranger, nor the amount of play with the owner versus stranger. In addition, the absence of the owner did not significantly reduce the time spent playing with the stranger as would be expected if the owner functioned as a secure-base [14]. This might reflect the observation that in cats, unlike humans and dogs, much play is typically associated with solitary predatory type activity, and so may not have a social relevance. Passive behaviours, indicative of relaxation, are suggested as a measure of the secure-base effect in children [10]. However, passive behaviour may not be so easy to interpret in cats [43], [44]. Edwards et al., (2007) [7] found that cats were more inactive in the presence of the stranger in their test, and a similar result was found in the current study. Thus it seems that in the context of SST, passive behaviour by domestic cats, may be associated more with a state of anxiety rather than comfort, as has been found in other studies [43], [44]. However, a difference was only found in half of the comparable episodes, and these were the ones in the middle of the test (episodes 4 and 6). If the owner were acting as a secure base within the strange environment, it would be predicted that the effect of their presence over that of the stranger would be greatest at the first separation (episode 2) but this was not the case, since there was no significant difference in the amount of passive behaviour exhibited by the cat at this time. At best it might be argued that the owner has a small effect on the perceived safety of the environment, and this is not strong enough to impact on the behaviour of the cat when it first enters a strange environment, but perhaps as the cat habituates to the environment, the owner\u2019s may have a small effect over that of the stranger. However, this would also indicate that towards the end of the test the cat was sufficiently habituated to the environment, so as not to need the support of another. An alternative and arguably more parsimonious explanation of the finding would relate to the cat\u2019s independence and habituation to the environment and stranger. The strangeness of the environment inhibits the cat (episode 2), and the return of someone after the cat has been alone (episode 4) has a differential effect depending on the identity of that individual. If it is the stranger, then the situation is still novel, whereas if it is the owner it provides a degree of familiarity. The next occasion when a difference is assessed, is episode 6 when either the stranger or owner leaves after they have both been present. The lack of familiarisation with the stranger at this time, would mean the environment is still strange due to their presence, however, by episode 8 (as indicated by the marking behaviour) the stranger has now become familiar and so there is no difference when the cat is left with the owner compared to the stranger. These results examining a potential secure base effect together with those relating to proximity seeking suggest there is a dynamic between the strangeness of the physical environment and the stranger, and that habituation to them occurs at a different rate, occurring to the environment sooner than the stranger, with familiarisation of the stranger being a function of them being marked. \n \n The data relating to potential stress when separated are consistent with a preference for interaction with the owner over the stranger, but not with secure attachment. Standing by the door is a particularly robust measure of separation distress in dogs [13], but was found to be inconsistent in cats, as was vigilance behaviour. This suggests either that cats do not show distress in this way, or that the cats are not particularly distressed by the departure of the owner. By contrast, vocalisation was found to be a robust measure, but differences in vocalisation depending on whether the owner or stranger was absent, are not necessarily consistent with the bond with the owner providing a secure base. Although there was a difference in vocalisation when the cat was left with either the owner or stranger after the other had left (episodes 6 versus 8), there was no difference in vocalisation following the return of the owner or stranger after the cat had been alone. This would be consistent with vocalisation occurring in response to frustration at the owner\u2019s departure, perhaps as a result of previous reinforcement of the interaction (as often occurs at feeding [45]), rather than the owner providing comfort in the strange environment. From a neurobiological perspective separation from a secure attachment figure results in engagement of a different affective system (PANIC sensu Panksepp [46] compared to separation from an individual who is associated with physical reinforcements (RAGE sensu Panksepp [46]), although both might result in superficially similar behaviour aimed at reinstating contact. In the case of the cat, vocalisation meets the requirement in both situations and so, this measure alone is not sufficient to infer that the cat is attached to its owner as a source of safety and security. \n \n The Ainsworth procedure is suggested to be highly suitable for dogs since it reproduces situations that they are likely to encounter in their everyday lives [14], (potential need for support from their carer). In contrast most cats are unlikely to encounter such situations on a regular basis and it might be argued that this impacts negatively on the validity of the test as it is such an artificial situation. However, in this particular instance and given the theoretical underpinnings of the SST, we suggest that the set-up chosen actually increases the validity of our procedure for the following reasons. The vast majority of cats were home based as is common in the UK and so a novel environment is likely to pose a suitably intimidating challenge to induce the expression of secure attachment related behaviours if they existed [11]. In addition, few of the cats in this study, had much experience of strange situations outside the home. A visit to the vet might be the most likely analogous situation encountered, but none were taken to the vet regularly (for example for treatment of a chronic medical condition); none were reported to be experiencing this type of situation on a regular basis. By contrast, largely outdoor cats who travel a lot to new places, might get used to environmental novelty more readily and this could result in a false negative response. In this regard, it is worth noting that the data from two cat subjects were eliminated from the analysis because their behaviour did not show variation within the test; the hiding and behavioural inhibition observed by these cats are consistent with higher stress levels [43],[44] but it is clear that the presence of the owner was not able to ameliorate these effects, which should be the case if they serve as an attachment figure in the original sense of Bowlby [8], as compared to the wider sense used by some authors [47]. \n \n It might be argued that, the behaviours chosen to assess attachment are not biologically relevant given the nature of the cat as a largely independent, solitary hunter. However, this aspect of the cat may be precisely the reason why the relationship with the owner is not characterised by the safety and security features of a classical attachment bond. Even when accounting for a different function in superficially similar behaviour categories between species (such as passiveness), the evidence from the current study refutes the notion that cats normally show attachment to the owner in the way Bowlby defined attachment [8] and has been found in dogs [13] and claimed to occur in cats [7]. Despite this, there is good evidence that some cats can show separation related problems [6] and there are several possible reasons for this. It may be that a sub-population of cats showing clinical signs do become genuinely attached in the way described by Bowlby, but we consider this unlikely if attachment has a strong biological function and in light of some of our unpublished observations. An alternative explanation is that these problems are perhaps more of a response to frustration at owner absence [39]. This hypothesis lays the foundation for further research and the development of more specific intervention protocols as a result. \n \n Although cats can be social, sociality is likely to exist on a continuum, varying between individuals, but perhaps skewed towards independency. They have been domesticated for a relatively short time in comparison to dogs and have not been selectively bred to live in close contact with people [27], nor is their natural social system highly dependent on the same type of close social bonds [23]. Indeed, within the human-cat relationship the frequency and duration of interactions have been observed to be low in comparison to dogs [35]. These factors are likely to affect the nature of the relationship that typically forms between cat and owner, and make the formation of cat-human attachment unlikely. Nonetheless, some may be capable of forming very strong attachments, but this would not seem to be the norm. However, cats do seem to have a preference for their owner over an unfamiliar individual but the extent to which this is conditioned or the result of an intrinsic psychological tendency to bond remains unclear.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 There are a lot of cats in the United States. Perhaps close to 95 million live with us as pets, reports the Times-Picayune. But does our affection for these feline friends move in just one direction? New research in the journal PLoS One suggests that domesticated cats are more independent than dogs because they have less \"secure attachment\" to their owners. In this case, attachment \"is not simply an affectionate bond,\" the researchers write, but relates to \"the carer being perceived as a focus of safety and security in otherwise threatening environments.\" Past research has indicated that some cats whose owners leave them alone display signs of separation anxiety, as dogs do. \"But the results of our study show that they are in fact much more independent than canine companions,\" says lead researcher Daniel Mills. \"It seems that what we interpret as separation anxiety might actually be signs of frustration.\" Behavioral scientists at the University of Lincoln in the UK tested this by observing cats in unfamiliar environments with their owners, with strangers, and alone. They were looking for three distinct characteristics of attachment: the amount of contact a cat sought, its level of passive behavior, and its distress when the owner was absent. Cats were, it turns out, more vocal when their owners left them than when strangers did, but they demonstrated no other signs of attachment, hence the possibility that the vocalization was not one of longing; the researchers posit it could indicate frustration or just be a \"learned response.\" \"Our findings don\u2019t disagree with the notion that cats develop social preferences or close relationships,\" says Mills, \"but they do show that these relationships do not appear to be typically based on a need for safety and security.\" (One woman's attempt to rescue her cat from a cliff didn't go so well.)",
    "generated_summary": "Study by animal behaviour specialists at the University of Lincoln, UK, shows that while dogs perceive their owners as a safe base, the relationship between people and their feline friends appears to be quite different. Results of the study reveal that while cats might prefer to interact with their owner, they do not rely on them for reassurance when in an unfamiliar environment. Researchers believe this is because of the nature of the species as a largely independent and solitary hunter. The research, published in the scientific journal PLOS ONE, was led by Professor Daniel Mills , Professor of Veterinary Behavioural Medicine at Lincoln\u2019s School of Life Sciences.",

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The driver accused of plowing into a crowd at the South by Southwest Festival, killing two and injuring 23 others, has been identified as 21-year-old Rashad Owens of Killeen, Texas, reports the Austin American-Statesman. Police say the tragedy began about 12:30am when an officer tried to pull over Owens for suspected drunken driving. Owens pulled into a gas station parking lot, then gunned it the wrong way down a one-way street, say police. He eventually turned onto Red River Street, crashed through a barricade and struck festivalgoers, say authorities. Killed were Steven Craenmehr, who was riding a bike, and an Austin woman who was riding a moped. She hasn't been identified. Craenmehr worked for Amsterdam's MassiveMusic. Because he is charged with capital murder, Owens faces the death penalty. \u201cThat vehicle was used as a weapon, and he will be charged with those crimes,\u201d says Austin's police chief. Two people remain in critical condition with head injuries, and six others are still in the hospital with lesser injuries. A soldier at Fort Hood, meanwhile, has reported that his car was stolen, and it appears to be the vehicle driven by Owens, reports MySanAntonio.com. Owens himself is not a Fort Hood soldier. In 2011, he was charged with driving under the influence and leaving the scene of an accident in Fairbanks, Alaska, reports a separate American-Statesman story.",

But then he hummed. Let\u2019s have a listen to the Prime Minister\u2019s self-composed opus: \n \n .@David_Cameron humming a Winnie-the-Pooh style hum as he says goodbye to the cares of office. pic.twitter.com/kcydnLZBg4 \u2014 Robert Peston (@Peston) July 11, 2016 \n \n And this is roughly what we think he was humming: \n \n Understandably, the media have jumped on this surprising musical act, but we\u2019ve investigated further. \n \n \n \n Let\u2019s start with the time signature. A brisk 3/4, with a crotchet roughly equalling 108 a minute, suggests activity. Positivity, even. But 3/4 is not the most immediately stable of signatures. It\u2019s easy to feel secure in 3/4, but for just a couple of bars it\u2019s disconcerting - especially when starting with an anacrusis. \n \n What does Theresa May's taste in music say about her? > \n \n Harmonically, too, it\u2019s ambivalent, confusing. It\u2019s almost fanfare-like in that confident leap of a fourth from G to C, but it quickly loses confidence when it mirrors the ascent later in the bar, plummeting down to D sharp, forming an awkward implied triad. \n \n \n \n And then the percussive spoken \u2018Right\u2019, which lands almost perfectly on the first beat of the next bar, is a strange dip into acted-out recitative - demonstrative of a reasonable knowledge of contemporary composition techniques. \n \n There is a theory that the soon-to-be-former PM is actually humming the opening of Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony \u2013 of which more here. \n \n Conclusion \n \n So, Wagnerian fanfare, Beethoven-esque harmonic doubt and then a strange contemporary flourish at the end. Does this composition demonstrate the unresolved nature of Cameron\u2019s swift departure from office? Is it perhaps a comment on what might be next for 10 Downing Street? \n \n \n \n Other interpretations on this new and invigorating work are welcome. We\u2019re thinking a new fugue arrangement, a cappella choral version, maybe a theme and variations\u2026",

    "document": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Violent crime in the United States increased in 2015 but remained far below peak levels of the 1990s, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Monday as presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump prepared for a debate that is likely to focus on public safety. \n \n Phone banks dedicated to the Federal Bureau of Investigation are shown during a tour of the Multi-Agency Communications Center (MACC) at an undisclosed location in the Chicago suburbs May 17, 2012. REUTERS/Frank Polich \n \n While murder, rape and assault remained far below the peak levels of the 1990s, last year\u2019s increase in the violent crime rate could provide fodder for Trump, a Republican who has portrayed himself as a \u201claw and order\u201d candidate willing to support aggressive policing tactics. Clinton, a Democrat, has said many of his crime-fighting proposals amount to unconstitutional attacks on American freedoms. \n \n The FBI report could \u201cbe turned into political football,\u201d said Harvard Law School research fellow Robert Smith. \n \n At 372.6 incidents per 100,000 people, the 2015 violent-crime rate is higher than the 2014 rate of 361.6 but still well below the 1996 level of 636.6. The increase was most pronounced in big cities, the report found. \n \n On the campaign trail, Trump frequently points to rising crime rates as a reason to support \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d tactics and other police methods that critics say unfairly target minorities. \n \n Clinton has pushed for stricter gun control to help curb violence and has called for national guidelines on the use of force by police officers. \n \n In 2015, there were an estimated 15,696 murders in the United States, compared with an estimated 14,164 the prior year, according to the report. Last year\u2019s crime rate was still lower than in 2012 and earlier years, the FBI found. \n \n Crime was highest in the southern United States, the report found. At 45.9 per 100,000 people, the murder and manslaughter rate in the region was more than twice as high as in the West, the Midwest and the Northeast, according to the FBI. Rates of rape, assault and property crime were dramatically higher as well. \n \n FBI Director James Comey warned last year that violent crime in the United States might rise because increased scrutiny of policing tactics had created a \u201cchill wind\u201d that discouraged officers from using aggressive tactics. \n \n The rise in crime has been concentrated in big cities\u2019 segregated and impoverished neighborhoods. Experts said crime there can best be fought through better community policing and alternatives to incarceration for nonviolent crime. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re just beginning to see a shift in mentality in law enforcement from a warrior mentality... to a guardian mentality,\u201d Carter Stewart, a former prosecutor for the Southern District of Ohio, said on the teleconference. \u201cI don\u2019t want us as a country to go backwards.\u201d \n \n In Chicago, 54 more people were murdered in 2015 than in the previous year, a 13 percent jump in the city\u2019s murder rate, according to an April study by New York University\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice. ||||| Today, the FBI released its annual compilation of crimes reported to its Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program by law enforcement agencies from around the nation. Crime in the United States, 2015 reveals a 3.9 percent increase in the estimated number of violent crimes and a 2.6 percent decrease in the estimated number of property crimes last year when compared to 2014 data. \n \n According to the report, there were an estimated 1,197,704 violent crimes committed around the nation. While that was an increase from 2014 figures, the 2015 violent crime total was 0.7 percent lower than the 2011 level and 16.5 percent below the 2006 level. \n \n Among some of the other statistics contained in Crime in the United States, 2015:",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The number of murders in the US rose 11% last year from 2014, while the number of violent crimes saw a modest increase of 4% after two years of decline, per an FBI press release. Rapes rose 6.3%, aggravated assaults increased 4.6%, and robberies rose by 1.4% during the same period. These stats come from the FBI's latest crime report, though NPR notes it's important to put the figures in context: These violent crimes were still way down compared to other recent years, and especially more than 20 years ago, when figures spiked. For instance, despite its 11% increase this year, the number of murders dropped 9.3% from 2006. \"The number of rapes is less than in 2009, the number of robberies less than in \u2026 2013, and assaults less than in 2010. Still quite safe,\" a Fordham law professor and crime expert notes on Twitter. Not that it's all smooth sailing. US Attorney General Loretta Lynch addressed the increase Monday, noting that violence \"tears at the fabric of our common life\" and that \"we still have so much work to do,\" per the Washington Post. And FBI Director James Comey said in May it doesn't make him feel better that violent crime has risen over the past year, even if it hasn't reached historic low points. In terms of last year's murders, firearms were involved in about 72% of the cases, and seven cities or regions\u2014Chicago, Baltimore, Houston, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Kansas City, and DC\u2014accounted for much of 2015's spurt. Don't be surprised if the crime report comes up in Monday night's debate between Clinton and Trump: A Harvard Law School research fellow said Friday the stats could be turned into a \"political football\" during their faceoff, per Reuters.

(Courtesy of Uber) \n \n Haven't gotten your flu shot yet? On Thursday, you can order one up using Uber. \n \n Customers who normally use the Uber smartphone app to call for a ride will be able to request a flu shot -- and a nurse in an Uber car will show up at their home or office in about three dozen cities across the country. \n \n The charge is $10, but the nurse can give up to 10 flu shots at each location for no additional charge. So work colleagues can split the cost among themselves. \n \n But it's only a one-day offer. \n \n Sorry, kids. There's a nationwide FluMist shortage so you'll probably have to get a shot. \n \n Last year, the company provided flu shots for a day in Boston, New York, Washington and Chicago. The effort was so successful -- with more than 2,000 vaccinations -- that Uber and its partners decided to scale up this winter. \n \n The on-demand flu shots will be available between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. Passport Health, a travel-clinic company with locations across North America, is again providing the registered nurses. \n \n Organizers expect interest to be high. Users will be able to tap an option labeled \"UberHEALTH\" to request a nurse. \n \n \"If you don't get one the first time, you'll get a message that basically says all cars are busy and to please try again,\" said company representative Sarah Maxwell. \n \n \n \n Screenshot of what Uber users will see if they want to request a flu shot. \n \n Organizers plan to have more than 10,000 flu shots available. Hundreds of nurses will be at the ready in Uber vehicles across the country, with the specific number varying by city, Maxwell said. The $10 fee will cover a portion of the total cost; the remainder is being donated by Uber, Passport Health, and Epidemico, a public health data mining company owned by Booz Allen Hamilton. \n \n Another reason the ouch! of a flu shot may be worth it \n \n John Brownstein, an epidemiologist at Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, came up with the idea last year as a strategy for boosting vaccination rates. Though experts say vaccination is the single best way to prevent the spread of influenza, only 30 percent of adults ages 18-49 get inoculated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Convenience and accessibility are often cited as barriers. \n \n But new technology may help address the convenience factor. Brownstein and researchers surveyed consumers who used the service last year to get their flu shots. Nearly 80 percent said they were unlikely to have gotten the vaccine if not for the on-demand delivery, according to a paper released Tuesday in the Annals of Internal Medicine. \n \n \"This is basically a hard-to-reach population,\" Brownstein said in an interview. \"They're not opposed to the vaccine. It's just not part of their routine.\" \n \n Whether such efforts are practical depend on cost-effectiveness and scalability, which the researchers didn't address in their paper. But if such programs are shown to be practical, they could be extremely useful in scenarios \"when near-complete immunization of the population is necessary to prevent circulation of an infectious agent, especially one with severe consequences,\" they noted. \n \n Here are the cities where the on-demand flu shots will be available to Uber users: \n \n Northeast: Baltimore; Boston; Hartford, Conn.; Hoboken, N.J.; Jersey City, N.J.; New York; Philadelphia; Providence, R.I..; Washington, Worcester, Mass. \n \n South: Atlanta; Charleston, S.C.; Charlotte, N.C.; Dallas; Houston; Nashville, Tenn.; New Orleans; Orlando; Raleigh/Durham, N.C.; Richmond; Tampa Bay, Fla. \n \n Midwest: Columbus, Ohio; Des Moines, Iowa; Detroit; Grand Rapids, Mich.; Indianapolis; Kansas City, Mo.; Milwaukee; Pittsburgh \n \n West: Boise, Idaho; Los Angeles; Orange County, Calif.; Phoenix; Portland, Ore.; San Francisco, Seattle. \n \n Read more: \n \n It's 3 a.m. and you're depressed.

Of course, there may be a tussle over who gets to keep the pack, which includes an UberHEALTH-branded water bottle and tote, tissues, hand sanitizer, and a lollipop. Those who select the UberHEALTH option via their app are asked to \"select a suitable indoor location prior to UberHEALTH arriving,\" and the shot may be administered to those ages 4 and up. The nurses will be provided by a company called Passport Health, which will share the costs of the program with Uber and health data-mining firm Epidemico, reports the Chicago Tribune.

    "document": "In the R-rated comedy Rough Night, five friends from college - played by Scarlett Johansson, Kate McKinnon, Jillian Bell, Ilana Glazer, and Zo\u00eb Kravitz - reunite when they rent a beach house in Miami for a wild bachelorette weekend that goes completely off the rails. Just when all hope is lost, they realize there's more to the story than they could've ever imagined. ||||| \u201cRough Night,\u201d a bachelorette-party-from-hell thriller comedy that\u2019s got some push and some laughs, despite its essentially formulaic nature, is a perfect example of why Hollywood needs (many) more women filmmakers. Do we want to see more women directors who have the scalding audacity of a Kathryn Bigelow, or who can turn a tent-pole origin story like \u201cWonder Woman\u201d into a cultural event the way Patty Jenkins did? Duh and duh. That said, we also need more women to direct the MOR entertainment of the week. In the case of a goofy-nasty bad-behavior farce like \u201cRough Night,\u201d directed and co-written by Lucia Aniello, what\u2019s novel isn\u2019t so much the plot as the spin, the female gaze, the inside-the-club sensibility. That, for all the cookie-cutter elements, is what\u2019s fresh about the movie, and why it should find a solid audience. \n \n But first, a word on how derivative it is. In \u201cRough Night,\u201d four college chums reunite for a weekend trip to Miami, where they\u2019ve borrowed a splendid beach house to hold a bachelorette bash for Jess (Scarlett Johansson). A decade ago, they were frat-house-party hellions who could guzzle their way through a night of beer pong. But they\u2019ve grown up \u2014 sort of. Jess, now with clipped conservative hair, is running for state senator, and she and her fianc\u00e9e, Peter (Paul W. Downs), are so respectable and adult that they\u2019re already like an old married couple, too bone-weary for sex. Frankie (Ilana Glazer), a lesbian and full-time activist, organizes protests faster than she can get people to show up for them, and Blair (Zo\u00eb Kravitz), who is Frankie\u2019s former lover, is in the thick of a divorce and child-custody battle. Then there\u2019s Alice (Jillian Bell), the exception who proves the rule \u2014 which is to say, she\u2019s still every bit the needy, arrested drunk-girl narcissist she was in college. \n \n More Reviews San Sebasti\u00e1n Film Review: 'Yuli' TV Review: NBC's 'New Amsterdam' \n \n The four go out to a club, where they do endless shots and too much cocaine, and they\u2019re introduced to Jess\u2019 outside BFF, an Aussie free spirit named Pippa (Kate McKinnon of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d). Then they go back to the house, where the requisite male stripper has been put on order. A dude shows up at the door (he\u2019s sexy, but seems a little too threatening to be a stripper), and moments later, after push quite literally comes to shove, he\u2019s lying on the floor, a pool of blood spreading beneath him. It\u2019s a complete accident, but he is dead. \n \n Ninety-nine percent of the people who see \u201cRough Night\u201d will have no idea that it lifts its premise, and much of its flavor, from an edgy and overlooked 1998 movie called \u201cVery Bad Things,\u201d which starred Christian Slater and was Peter Berg\u2019s first film as a director. It was about a group of guys who accidentally kill a prostitute during a bachelor party in Vegas; what they do to hide the disaster is hideous but \u2014 as Berg staged it \u2014 creepily plausible, and the film, though it never caught on, had a queasy power as a foray into the dark side of the male psyche. \u201cRough Night\u201d is a lighter entertainment. It\u2019s \u201cVery Bad Things\u201d with the sexes reversed, but also with a harmless synthetic dollop of the \u201cHangover\u201d films, a replay of the best-friend-of-the-bride jealousy drama of \u201cBridesmaids,\u201d plus a touch of \u201cWeekend at Bernie\u2019s.\u201d It\u2019s all been mashed together in the comedy compactor, yet the best thing about \u201cRough Night\u201d is the feisty, claws-out spontaneity of its competitive banter between \u201csisters\u201d who love and hate each other. \n \n Lucia Aniello and her co-writer, Paul W. Downs, are two of the forces behind the web-gone-Comedy Central series \u201cBroad City\u201d (which was co-created by Glazer), but this movie is a lot broader. It\u2019s farcical, situational, and over-the-top, yet it gives the actresses room to maneuver. Johansson, who got swallowed up in the \u201cBlade-Runner\u201d-meets-broken-glass cyber doldrums of \u201cGhost in the Shell,\u201d has long avoided this sort of unabashed megaplex comedy, but it\u2019s a pleasure to see her take on a role in which she can coast along on the no-nonsense vibrance of her personality. She makes Jess cautious but fast \u2014 a grown-up trying to let loose even as she keeps her inner desperado in check. Glazer, likewise, creates a lived-in character: a social justice warrior who is spoiled and annoying enough to cue us to the fact that her stridency is compensating for something. \n \n It\u2019s Jillian Bell who\u2019s the film\u2019s comic spark plug. Her Alice, as scripted, may seem like a walking \u201closer,\u201d but Bell has the kind of hostile crack timing that Kathryn Hahn did in \u201cBad Moms.\u201d When she gets a line like \u201cI can\u2019t just go to jail! I couldn\u2019t even make it through the first episode of \u2018Orange Is the New Black,'\u201d she delivers it with dramatic sincerity, digging into the character\u2019s anxiety, and her one-way duel with Pippa says much about the possessiveness of friendship. When Alice glares at her rival, her dark-saucer eyes gleam with a hilariously paranoid desperation that\u2019s almost touching. \n \n What do these five characters do with a corpse on their hands? They figure out ways to get rid of it. They debate the issue of whether they\u2019re guilty of involuntary manslaughter (as long as the body just lies there, no; as soon as they make the mistake of moving it, maybe yes). And when they learn that the wealthy swingers next door, played with a bit too much on-the-nose hambone smarminess by Demi Moore and Ty Burrell, have surveillance cameras that may have recorded their cover-up scheme, they send Blair over to the house to sleep with the couple \u2014 a twist that would have worked better if Zo\u00eb Kravitz had more of a comic angle to play. \n \n There are plenty of gags in \u201cRough Night\u201d that don\u2019t work, like the overly obvious role-reversal stunt of having Jess\u2019 fianc\u00e9e stage a bachelor party that\u2019s an absurdly effete evening of wine-tasting. McKinnon, as Pippa, has an effervescent silliness, but too much of the joke of her performance boils down to her doing an Aussie accent as if that were a bubbly novelty. Yet Peter\u2019s all-night-long drive to Miami to rescue Jess gets funnier as it goes along, and what\u2019s amusing about the movie is the cocky texture of its feminine bonding \u2014 the jokes about home bikini waxing or scarfing pizza over a dead body, delivered with a new style of merciless aggression. It\u2019s hardly the first, or most original, comedy of female outrage to come along, but we\u2019ve had 40 years of men behaving badly on screen, stretching back to \u201cNational Lampoon\u2019s Animal House,\u201d and watching these ladies get their turn generates a slobby low-down kick. ||||| Rough Night \n \n We gave it a C+ \n \n To paraphrase Mel Brooks, \u201cTragedy is when I cut my finger. Comedy is the second time the dead stripper in penis sunglasses falls off a Jet Ski.\u201d Or maybe it\u2019s just Rough Night, a raunchy, wildly off-the-rails farce from the team that more or less brought you Broad City. \n \n Scarlett Johansson is Jess, a 30ish Senate candidate who can barely spare a minute to sit down for Seamless with her fianc\u00e9 (Paul W. Downs, also a co-writer), let alone celebrate their upcoming union. Her college roommate Alice (Jillian Bell) is the one who insists on reuniting the old crew for an elaborate bachelorette weekend in Miami \u2014 including freelance radical Frankie (Ilana Glazer) and Blair (Zo\u00eb Kravitz), now a sleek corporate type \u2014 even if their paths have diverged since their dorm-room days of midnight Doritos and beer pong. (The arrival of Jess\u2019 Australian year-abroad friend Pippa, played with cracked New Age glee by Kate McKinnon, is a cross she\u2019ll have to bear.) \n \n Somewhere between the cocaine, the Weenie Linguine, and the Craigslist gigolo, things somehow begin to go wrong. Director Lucia Aniello stacks her loose cannon of a script with a few truly great bits and some inspired casting \u2014 including Ty Burrell and Demi Moore as a pair of predatory, praline-colored swingers \u2014 but then never quite trusts their gifts, blowing out her Girls Just Wanna Have Hangovers conceit until it feels like the summer-movie equivalent of a fidget spinner: shiny, manic, and spiraling to nowhere. C+ ||||| It\u2019s hard enough being a woman filmmaker these days, but consider the plight of the woman filmgoer. It took years to get a big-budget Wonder Woman vehicle, and if you really must have role models in your movies, she\u2019s probably not a bad one. But comedies in which women behave really badly\u2014like 2016\u2019s Bad Moms or Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie, or the more recent Snatched\u2014have become the happy-hour cosmo of moviegoing. They\u2019re plentiful, and supposedly just the ticket for women looking for a \u201cgirls\u2019 night out\u201d picture, just something fun to see for kicks. But if they\u2019re supposed to be just a diversion, why\u2014one after another\u2014do they torture us with so many questions? Am I supposed to like this? Is this supposed to be funny? Does this really represent what Hollywood thinks most\u2014or even just many or some\u2014women really want from big-screen entertainment? \n \n Rough Night, directed and co-written by Lucia Aniello\u2014who has also written and directed numerous episodes of Broad City\u2014is the latest entry in the \u201cwomen whooping it up\u201d genre, and it doesn\u2019t make any of the above questions easier to answer. The movie\u2014co-written by Paul Downs, Aniello\u2019s boyfriend and writing partner, who also appears in the picture\u2014is at its best when it catches the precise crosscurrent between sleazy and breezy. Scarlett Johansson is Jess, who\u2019s launching a bid for state senator\u2014she\u2019s also about to be married, an adventure that just might be scarier than running for public office. Her old college clique\u2014hoity-toity real-estate diva Blair (Zo\u00eb Kravitz), kooky activist Frankie (Ilana Glazer, of Broad City) and randy, insecure teacher Alice (Jillian Bell)\u2014are spiriting her off to Miami for one last bachelorette weekend. They don\u2019t know that she has also invited Pippa (Kate MacKinnon), a college friend they don\u2019t know\u2014Jess met her while spending a year abroad. Pippa is Australian, a loopy good-time girl with an Earth-mother streak, and her accent is a wild ocean of exaggerated rolling vowels. She barges into the movie in an assortment of tropical-printed rompers and maxi dresses, and she gets the movie\u2019s best lines\u2014or maybe she only makes them the best, unreeling them like crazy-colored party streamers. \n \n The opening third of Rough Night is the best part of the movie and also the most predictable: The women get to Miami and commence partying, hard, immediately. Why is it funny when Frankie scores some coke and the women, at first reluctant to partake (one of them is running for public office, after all), end up descending upon it like gulls fighting for a scrap of fruit on a beach? Somehow the loose, coarse nuttiness of it works. There are props, including funny glasses with a fake penis where the nose should be. There\u2019s a male stripper\u2014make that two male strippers, at least in the literal sense that two brawny guys end up stripping down. But when the movie takes a sort-of dark turn into black-comedy territory, it starts to fall apart. The new, supposedly outrageous scenarios just aren\u2019t as funny as the stock women-gone-wild gags. Ty Burrell and Demi Moore show up in tiny roles, as a kinky, predatory couple, but their oily come-ons are more limp than they are slippery. \n \n The idea behind Rough Night isn\u2019t bad by itself, and it\u2019s fun to watch Johansson cutting loose in a comedy for a change. The picture also offers a few sight gags that are pure, dumb genius: they just work. (The sight of Downs, as Jess\u2019 fiance, gingerly and acrobatically polishing the windshield of an eighteen-wheeler\u2014did I mention he\u2019s wearing a diaper?\u2014isn\u2019t something you\u2019re likely to forget soon.) But Rough Night tries hard to capture the pleasurably profane, uncorked spirit of Broad City and doesn\u2019t quite succeed, maybe because the joys of the show lie in how casual and intimate it is. Its glimpses into believable neurotic behavior among women are larkish and offhand\u2014but blown up for the big screen, they\u2019re not quite enough to fill it. I laughed a few times at Rough Night, often at MacKinnon and at least once at Downs in his diaper. And really, as Hangover-style dumb entertainments go, it\u2019s certainly good enough. Which isn\u2019t to say it\u2019s anything close to what what women want.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A mostly female cast gathers for director Lucia Aniello's Rough Night, which reveals just how bad a bachelorette weekend with college friends can get, especially when male strippers are involved. If this plot seems a bit tired to you, you're not alone. The movie has a lackluster approval rating of about 50% among critics on Rotten Tomatoes, despite big-name stars such as Scarlett Johannson and Kate McKinnon. Samples: Rough Night \"offers a few sight gags that are pure, dumb genius\" and \"is at its best when it catches the precise crosscurrent between sleazy and breezy.\" But when the movie takes a dark turn, \"it starts to fall apart,\" Stephanie Zacharek writes at Time. \"As Hangover-style dumb entertainments go, it's certainly good enough,\" she adds, but she isn't sure this is \"anything close\" to what women want to see. Owen Gleiberman, on the other hand, says Rough Night is \"a perfect example of why Hollywood needs (many) more women filmmakers.\" Though its formula is quite \"derivative,\" its female perspective makes it fresh, he writes at Variety. The best elements: \"the feisty, claws-out spontaneity of its competitive banter between 'sisters' who love and hate each other\" and Jillian Bell, \"the film's comic spark plug.\" Leah Greenblatt was less tickled. Rough Night is \"a raunchy, wildly off-the-rails farce\" that \"feels like the summer-movie equivalent of a fidget spinner: shiny, manic, and spiraling to nowhere,\" she writes at Entertainment Weekly. She does commend the casting\u2014naming Ty Burrell and Demi Moore, who play a swingers couple\u2014but adds the actors have to deal with a \"loose cannon of a script.\" \"Well, at least they got the title right,\" begins Adam Graham at the Detroit News. The rest of his review is no less harsh. \"Rough Night is a dismal, excruciating experience, a tired retread of raunchy comedy tropes that can't be bothered to come up with any funny or original bits,\" he writes. Like one of its characters on cocaine, \"it's frantic, scattered and convinced of its own greatness,\" then \"empty and rather sad.\"",

On it, they saw Zhang entering a storage closet twice in one day, once for 54 minutes and again for 90 minutes later in the day.

He is signing up for time that is also available to others \u2014 if he doesn't take the hours, someone else will.

But according to public records uncovered by Transparent California, his also raked in an additional $162,050 in overtime, bringing his total salary and benefits that year to $271,243. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely outrageous,\u201d said Robert Fellner, with Transparent California. \n \n Fellner has examined public employee salary information for years, and says he has never seen anything like this. \n \n \u201cFor Janitors that\u2019s obscene! It\u2019s unconscionable!\u201d \n \n 2 Investigates obtained Zhang\u2019s timecard data and plotted it out over the calendar year. The results showed the BART paid Zhang every single day in 2015. Most days he worked overtime, clocking in about 17 hours of work. He also used some days of paid vacation and holidays in order to rake in pay for 365 days that year. \n \n In one stretch during July 2015, Zhang worked 17 hour days for 18 days straight, according to timecard records. \n \n \u201cSuper human!\u201d said Fellner. \u201cThe average reaction to that is \u2018How is that possible?'\" \n \n RELATED STORY \n \n BART\u2019s Chief Transportation Officer Roy Aguilera says it\u2019s possible because Zhang never refuses extra work and picks up much of the overtime hours offered. \n \n Aguilera says the population of homeless people who spend time in the Powell Street station means the janitorial staff spends much of their time cleaning up urine, feces, and needles, which he calls \u201ctotally unacceptable.\u201d \n \n \u201cPeople are not raising their hands and saying, \u2018I want some of that overtime.\u2019 Mr. Zhang has said yes, he\u2019s worked hard, he\u2019s completed his assignments, so I stand by the work he\u2019s done,\u201d Aguilera said. \n \n When asked whether he\u2019s check up on Zhang\u2019s performance, time cards, or overtime hours, Aguilera said he personally hasn\u2019t but the supervisors working under him have. \n \n 2 Investigates learned that BART has never conducted an extensive investigation of Zhang\u2019s time cards, despite the janitor earning more than $705,000 in pay and benefits during the four years from 2012 to 2015. \n \n Graph Source: BART Spokesperson Alicia Trost \n \n There have also been 49 other BART janitors who have earned more than $100,000 in 2015, and the agency also confirmed it has not audited or investigated those employees either. \n \n In an email, BART spokesperson Alicia Trost said \u201cThere are multiple management systems in place to ensure hours worked and assignments are completed.\u201d She also confirmed there is no future audit being considering after KTVU\u2019s investigation. \n \n But when 2 Investigates randomly checked on Zhang\u2019s performance and timesheets, discrepancies and questions quickly arose. While inspecting two random days of surveillance video from BART\u2019s own security cameras, KTVU investigators spotted Zhang working, sweeping, mopping on a riding machine, and taking out the trash. But, according to the timestamp on BART\u2019s video, Zhang also appears to have disappeared inside a storage closet for hours at a time. \n \n On the first day that 2 Investigates logged, Zhang appears to go into the closet twice, for 54 minutes and 90 minutes respectively. On the second day of video, he spends 90 minutes in the closet in the afternoon, and another 78 minutes behind the door later that evening. \n \n A BART spokesperson said she cannot be certain that Zhang is the janitor pictured in one of the video clips, but that in other instances it is \u201cobvious.\u201d She said the janitors may be cleaning, repairing equipment, or taking breaks in that closet, but the agency does not track breaks. Earlier, though, Aguilera had said the closet is not a break room and employees eat their lunches in a separate room in a different part of the station. But he wouldn\u2019t allow 2 Investigates to see inside the closet. \n \n 2 Investigates also found questions on Zhang\u2019s timesheet. Over two months, he failed to clock in or out to verify his hours three times. BART General Manager Grace Crunican said she wasn\u2019t aware of those discrepancies. \n \n \u201cWell, this piece is news to me, yes that would be concerning if we had an examination with the supervisor and there wasn\u2019t a good reason for that.\u201d \n \n Crunican also said she has not personally seen the surveillance video of Zhang spending hours inside the Powell Street station closet. She said she does not believe, based on the information she\u2019s seen, that Zhang\u2019s high pay and time sheet warrants an audit. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019ve increased the staffing two years in a row, we\u2019ve reduced the overtime this past year,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019ve reduced the number of hours for overtime.\u201d \n \n 2 Investigates also showed Crunican video of dirty conditions at Powell Street station taken over several days. It shows sticky handrails, trash on the floor, and dirt and dust built up under benches. \n \n \u201cI do agree with you that those levels those standards are not good,\u201d she said. \n \n Aguilera argued that because of the constant need to clean up human waste and drug at Powell Street that janitors do not have time to keep the rest of the station clean. He showed 2 Investigates a list of the janitors\u2019 daily duties and cleaning the elevators was listed as No. 2. Aguilera said the cleaning crew can rarely get past cleaning the elevators because of the constant mess. Cleaning the \u201crestroom, offices, lunch room, and locker rooms\u201d is number 11 on that list, and cleaning the \u201cjanitor\u2019s room\u201d is at the bottom. \n \n BART administration says that Zhang\u2019s direct supervisor approved all his timesheets and overtime, and they insist he is one of their best employees. \n \n But Fellner disagrees, insisting that enough questions exist about how custodians are being managed that BART should have audited their overtime and pay years ago. \u201cI would say a catastrophic management failure there.\u201d \n \n Source: Data compiled from timecard information provided by BART",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 There's quite a difference between making $58,000 a year and $270,000, and that huge gap is why some are now poking around to see how a San Francisco janitor has been pulling in the latter. The San Francisco Chronicle reports on Liang Zhao Zhang, who cleans the BART system's station at Powell Street and has a base salary of $57,945, per public records culled by Transparent California. But thanks to about $162,000 in hefty overtime pay and other compensation and benefits, Zhang raked in what amounts to $271,243 in 2015. Robert Fellner, a research director for the watchdog group, tells KTVU he's been keeping an eye on public employee salaries for years and has never seen a janitor get paid such an \"obscene\" and \"unconscionable\" amount. Nearly 50 other unaudited BART janitors also earned in the six figures in 2015. Fellner wants to know, for instance, how the \"superhuman\" Zhang worked 17-hour days for 18 days in a row during July 2015, a fact found during an analysis of Zhang's timecards, which turned up several \"discrepancies and questions.\" Roy Aguilera, BART's chief transportation officer, says Zhang just grabs extra hours no one wants. But when KTVU gained access to video on BART's security cameras for two random days, it witnessed Zhang head into a storage closet and hole up there for hours (on one day he was in the closet for 90 minutes, then later on for another 78). A BART rep says Zhang may have been fixing equipment or taking a break, though Aguilera tells KTVU there's a dedicated break area elsewhere. Fellner says the situation is a \"catastrophic management failure\" that should've been audited long ago. (The worst-paying jobs you have to go to college for.)",

It is widely reported to possess a large arsenal of chemical weapons, including mustard, phosgene and sarin gas, a United States Congressional Research Service report said last year. \n \n The announcement by Malaysia\u2019s police chief came just a day after North Korea denied any responsibility for Mr. Kim\u2019s death, accusing the Malaysian authorities of fabricating evidence of Pyongyang\u2019s involvement under the influence of South Korea. \n \n With the North\u2019s reclusive government on the defensive about the Feb. 13 killing of Mr. Kim, the estranged half brother of Kim Jong-un, at the airport for the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, a statement attributed to the North Korean Jurists Committee said the greatest share of responsibility for the death \u201crests with the government of Malaysia\u201d because Kim Jong-nam died there. And in what could be seen as a threat to Malaysia, the statement noted that North Korea is a \u201cnuclear weapons state.\u201d \n \n But in a case that has been filled with mysteries and odd plot twists, North Korea still would not acknowledge that the man killed was indeed Kim Jong-nam. And it gave no indication that it would agree to Malaysia\u2019s demands to question a senior staff member at the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur in the investigation into Mr. Kim\u2019s death. \n \n Relatives and acquaintances of the two women Malaysia has accused of carrying out the killing, by applying poison to Kim-Jong-nam\u2019s face as North Korean agents looked on, insisted they must have been duped into doing so, though the Malaysian authorities say otherwise. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t believe Huong did such a thing,\u201d said Doan Van Thanh, father of Doan Thi Huong, 28, a Vietnamese woman being held in Malaysia. \u201cShe was a very timid girl.

Lower doses can cause eye pain, blurred vision, drowsiness and vomiting \n \n It can be disseminated in a spray or vapour when used as a chemical weapon, or used to contaminate water, food, and agricultural products \n \n VX can be absorbed into the body by inhalation, ingestion, skin contact, or eye contact \n \n Clothing can carry VX for about 30 minutes after contact with the vapour, which can expose other people \n \n Banned by the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention \n \n Read more about VX \n \n Who could be behind the attack? \n \n How could it have killed Mr Kim? \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption CCTV footage appears to show the moment Kim Jong-nam is attacked \n \n Bruce Bennett, a weapons expert at the research institute the Rand Corporation, told the BBC it would have taken only a tiny amount of the substance to kill Mr Kim. \n \n He suggests a small quantity of VX - just a drop - was likely to have been put on cloths used by the attackers to touch his face. A separate spray may have been used as a diversion. \n \n Mr Khalid has previously said the fact the woman who accosted Mr Kim immediately went to wash her hands showed she was \"very aware\" that she had been handling a toxin. \n \n It would have begun affecting his nervous system immediately, causing first shaking and then death within minutes. \n \n More from expert Bruce Bennett \n \n Is Kuala Lumpur airport safe? \n \n The authorities say they intend to decontaminate the airport and areas the suspects are known to have visited. \n \n VX is a v-type nerve agent, which means the substance can remain lethal for a long period of time. \n \n \"It's as persistent as motor oil. It's going to stay there for a long time... which means anyone coming in contact with this could be intoxicated from it,\" forensic toxicologist John Trestrail told the Associated Press news agency. \n \n No passengers, airport workers or medical staff who treated Mr Kim were reported to have become ill in the aftermath of the incident, the news agency adds. \n \n Tens of thousands of passengers are believed to have passed through the airport since the attack more than 10 days ago. \n \n Who was Kim Jong-nam? \n \n Image copyright AP Image caption North Korea has not identified the man who died as Kim Jong-nam, only as a North Korean citizen \n \n The well-travelled and multilingual oldest son of late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, he was once considered a potential future leader. He has lived abroad for years and was bypassed in favour of his half-brother, Kim Jong-un. \n \n He had been travelling on a passport under the name Kim Chol. North Korea has yet to confirm that the deceased was actually Kim Jong-nam. \n \n For many years, it was believed Kim Jong-nam was being groomed to succeed his father as the next leader. \n \n But that appears to have come to an end in 2001 when Kim was caught sneaking into Japan on a fake passport. \n \n He later became one of the regime's most high-profile critics, openly questioning the Stalinist policies and dynastic succession his grandfather Kim Il-sung began crafting in 1948. \n \n Kim Jong-nam: North Korea's critic in exile \n \n How did he die? \n \n A woman was seen in CCTV footage approaching Mr Kim and wiping something across his face. He sought medical help at the airport, saying someone had splashed or sprayed him with liquid. \n \n He had a seizure and died on the way to hospital. \n \n His body remains in the hospital's mortuary, amid a diplomatic dispute over who should claim it. \n \n Main players in mysterious killing \n \n Who did it? \n \n Malaysia says it was clearly an attack by North Korean agents. Four people are in custody, including one North Korean and the two women he interacted with at the airport. Seven North Koreans are being sought, including a diplomat. \n \n There are a number of North Korean organisations capable of directing such an attack, including the exclusive Guard Command. \n \n The North hit back at Malaysia on Thursday, saying it was responsible for the death of one of its citizens. \n \n In response, Malaysian Foreign Minister Anifah Aman warned North Korean envoy Kang Chol on Friday that he would be expelled unless he stopped \"spewing lies\" about the attack. \n \n Who in North Korea could organise a VX murder? \n \n North Korea's history of foreign assassinations \n \n Does North Korea have VX? \n \n North Korea is one of just six countries not to have signed the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) arms control treaty banning the production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons. \n \n According to the Nuclear Threat Initiative project, however, North Korea is thought to have the third largest stockpile of chemical weapons, after the US and Russia. \n \n South Korea's defence ministry estimated in 2014 that the North has somewhere between 2,500 and 5,000 tonnes of nerve agents in stock, with VX identified as among them. ||||| FILE - In this May 4, 2001, file photo, a man believed to be Kim Jong Nam, the eldest son of then North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, looks at a battery of photographers as he exits a police van to board...

(Associated Press) \n \n KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) \u2014 The banned chemical weapon VX nerve agent was used to kill Kim Jong Nam, the North Korean ruler's outcast half brother who was poisoned last week at the airport in Kuala Lumpur, police said Friday. The announcement raised serious questions about public safety in a building that authorities went 11 days without decontaminating. \n \n The substance, deadly even in minute amounts, was detected on Kim's eyes and face, Malaysia's inspector general of police said in a written statement, citing a preliminary analysis from the country's Chemistry Department. \n \n \"Our preliminary finding of the chemical that caused the death of Kim Chol was VX nerve,\" said Inspector-General of Police Khalid Abu Bakar. Kim Chol is the name on the passport found on the victim, but a Malaysian official previously confirmed he is North Korea leader Kim Jong Un's older half brother. \n \n Khalid told reporters that one of the two women accused of wiping the toxin on Kim's face was later sickened and suffered from vomiting. He declined to say which of the women \u2014 one Indonesian and one Vietnamese \u2014 had gotten sick. \n \n Khalid said police were still investigating how the lethal agent entered Malaysia. \n \n Police previously said the airport had not been decontaminated. Asked Friday in a text message whether that was still the case, Khalid said, \"We are doing it now.\" Details were not immediately clear. \n \n Malaysian police also previously no one besides Kim Jong Nam had been sickened. \n \n If VX was used, it could have contaminated not only the airport but anyplace else Kim had been, including medical facilities and the ambulance he was transported in. The nerve agent, which has the consistency of motor oil, can take days or even weeks to evaporate. \n \n The death of Kim Jong Nam, whose daylight assassination in a crowded airport terminal seems straight out of a spy novel, has unleashed a diplomatic crisis that escalates by the day. With each new twist in the case, international speculation has grown that Pyongyang dispatched a hit squad to Malaysia to kill the exiled older sibling of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. \n \n North Korea has denounced Malaysia's investigation as full of \"holes and contradictions\" and accused the authorities here of being in cahoots with Pyongyang's enemies. \n \n According to Malaysian investigators, the two female suspects coated their hands with chemicals and wiped them on Kim's face on Feb. 13 as he waited for a flight home to Macau, where he lived with his family. \n \n He sought help from airport staff but he fell into convulsions and died on the way to the hospital within two hours of the attack, police said. \n \n The case has perplexed toxicologists, who question how the two women could have walked away unscathed after handling a powerful poison, even if \u2014 as Malaysian police say \u2014 the women were instructed to wash their hands right after the attack. \n \n Dr. Bruce Goldberger, a leading toxicologist who heads the forensic medicine division at the University of Florida, said even a tiny amount of VX nerve agent \u2014 equal to a few grains of salt \u2014 is capable of killing. It can be administered through the skin, and there is an antidote that can be administered by injection. U.S. medics and military personnel carried kits with them on the battlefield during the Iraq war in case they were exposed to the chemical weapon. \n \n \"It's a very toxic nerve agent. Very, very toxic,\" he said. \"I'm intrigued that these two alleged assassins suffered no ill effect from exposure to VX. It is possible that both of these women were given the antidote.\" \n \n He said symptoms from VX would generally occur within seconds or minutes and could last for hours starting with confusion, possible drowsiness, headache, nausea, vomiting, runny nose and watery eyes. Prior to death, there would likely be convulsions, seizures, loss of consciousness and paralysis. \n \n VX is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention, which North Korea never signed. The country is believed by outside experts to have the capacity to produce up to 4,500 metric tons of chemical weapons during a typical year, which it could increase to 12,000 tons per year during a period of crisis. Its current inventory has been estimated at 2,500 to 5,000 tons. \n \n It is suspected of being particularly focused on mustard, phosgene, sarin and V-type chemical agents \u2014 substances including VX that are designed to poison through contact and remain lethal for long periods of time. The North's development of such agents has been of special concern because of fears it might try to put them in artillery shells for an attack on South Korea's capital, potentially threatening the lives of millions. \n \n Joseph Bermudez, a well-known North Korea analyst, wrote an article for the respected 38 North website in 2013 that said the North is capable of not only employing \"significant quantities and varieties of chemical weapons\" across the Korean Peninsula but also using those weapons worldwide \"using unconventional methods of delivery.\" \n \n He also said there is a \"growing body of evidence\" indicating the North has shared chemical weapons capabilities with Syria, Iran and others. \n \n Malaysia has three people in custody in connection with Kim Jong Nam's death, including the two suspected attackers. Authorities are also seeking several other people, including the second secretary of North Korea's embassy in Kuala Lumpur and an employee of North Korea's state-owned airline, Air Koryo. \n \n The case has marked a serious turnaround in relations between Malaysia and North Korea. While Malaysia isn't one of Pyongyang's key diplomatic partners, it is one of the few places in the world where North Koreans can travel without a visa. As a result, for years, it's been a quiet destination for Northerners looking for jobs, schools and business deals. \n \n ___ \n \n AP writers Margie Mason in Jakarta, Indonesia, and Eric Talmadge in Tokyo contributed to this report.",

The country's police chief said toxicology reports on swabs from the face and eyes of the exiled North Korean found VX nerve agent, which the BBC notes is classed as a weapon of mass destruction by the United Nations. He said that one of two women believed to have rubbed the extremely toxic substance on Kim's face with their hands suffered from vomiting after the attack. The New York Times reports that VX agent can be created by mixing two compounds\u2014and police suspect the two women put the substances on Kim's face, one after the other, to create a deadly dose.

He has been in custody since last month. \n \n \n \n \n \n Samsung Group heir Lee Jae-yong (Yonhap) \n \n The special probe team suspects that Lee gave or promised 43.3 billion won ($38.3 million) in kickbacks to Park's friend Choi Soon-sil in return for the government's backing of a merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015.The business merger was seen as critical to the smooth management succession of the group from ailing Samsung Electronics Chairman Lee Kun-hee to his only son Jae-yong.Special prosecutors viewed Samsung's donation of 20.4 billion won in 2015 to two sports and culture foundations controlled by Choi as bribes.Lee has consistently insisted that Samsung's donations to Mir and K Sport foundations were made customarily in compliance with government requests, while its financial support for Choi and her family was forced by the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae.His lawyers repeated the same claims of innocence throughout the opening hearing.The lawyers said Lee's instructions to group executives following his one-on-one meetings in 2015 and 2016 with President Park remained unclear. They urged special prosecutors from resorting to presumptions in handling Lee's case.Lee's lawyers also raised questions over the participation of former prosecutor members of the special counsel team in the court hearing, saying the tenure of the special prosecutors already expired at the end of last month.The first hearing was finished after one hour amid fierce confrontation between lawyers and prosecutors.The Seoul district court is expected to give its ruling in late May. (Yonhap) ||||| The trial of Samsung Electronics Co. vice chairman Jay Y. Lee began Thursday, as prosecutors try to prove the billionaire conspired to funnel millions of dollars to a confidante of President Park Geun-hye to help secure control of the world\u2019s largest smartphone maker. \n \n Lee is the highest-profile business figure indicted in a sprawling corruption investigation that\u2019s also led to Park\u2019s impeachment and spurred outrage over \u201cchronic corruption\u201d in ties between government and family-run conglomerates. Special Prosecutor Park Young-soo has called the legal contest surrounding Lee South Korea\u2019s \u201ctrial of the century,\u201d given his global profile and the amounts of money involved. \n \n South Korea\u2019s Family-Run Conglomerates \n \n Hearings at Seoul\u2019s Central District Court are set to last up to three months, during which Lee will fight charges from bribery to embezzlement. The biggest point of contention will be whether Samsung\u2019s donations to entities led by Park\u2019s friend, Choi Soon-sil, were intended to win government backing for a controversial 2015 merger that made it easier for Lee to control the Samsung Group chaebol. The 48-year-old executive has denied wrongdoing. \n \n \u201cProving there was an exchange of money for favors is going to be challenging,\u201d said Hong Jung-seok, a lawyer who worked for the special prosecution until the end of last month. \u201cThe trial will draw attention from around the world, not just for the defendant\u2019s fame abroad, but also for the size of the alleged bribe.\u201d \n \n The preliminary hearing Thursday lasted about an hour with Lee\u2019s lawyers and prosecutors appearing before presiding judge Lee Yeong-hun. It\u2019s clear every step will be contentious. Lee\u2019s lawyers tried to show a PowerPoint presentation, but prosecutors objected the hearing was supposed to cover only the basics of the trial and the 47-year-old judge agreed. \n \n Defense lawyers then disputed the legitimacy of their opponents because the special prosecutor was helped during the hearing by regular state prosecutors. An elderly woman interrupted proceedings twice and then was physically removed by guards as she screamed. \n \n What\u2019s Behind the Samsung Bribery Allegations: QuickTake Q&A \n \n These are strange days in Seoul with some of the country\u2019s most powerful figures under scrutiny several miles apart. A constitutional court will decide at 11 a.m. Friday whether to uphold Park\u2019s impeachment and remove her from office, a ruling almost certain to provoke protests whatever the outcome. The scandal has already engulfed the streets of Korea\u2019s capital for months, as protests spring up regularly under the watch of police in riot gear. \n \n In trying to prove the case against Lee, prosecutors will probe the complex web of ties through which the chaebol that control Korea\u2019s economy allegedly trade money for political favors. Park\u2019s investigation has already led to about 30 indictments and ensnared establishment figures from the president of a prestigious university to the head of the country\u2019s horseback-riding association, who\u2019ve been accused of easing Choi\u2019s daughter\u2019s college admission and equestrian lessons. \n \n Lee now faces five years to life in prison if convicted. Under South Korea\u2019s three-tier judiciary system, Lee can turn to an appellate court and then the Supreme Court if he loses, with each court taking up to two months to deliberate. His own father avoided jail time despite two previous criminal convictions, thanks to government pardons. \n \n Lee\u2019s predicament casts uncertainty over the succession at Samsung, which has been in transition since his father suffered a crippling heart attack in 2014. The prolonged absence of its de-facto head may delay major decisions at Samsung Electronics, which is set to unveil the latest version of its flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S8, this month. Still, Samsung has said it has a strong management team in place to run the business, and the company\u2019s shares have risen 11.5 percent this year, more than three times the gain in the benchmark KOSPI index. \n \n Detained outside Seoul since February, Lee must win the trial to resume guiding a $240 billion corporation trying to bounce back from last year\u2019s botched debut of the Note 7, which showed a tendency to burst into flame. \n \n Lee was indicted last month along with four other Samsung executives, but was the only one to have been detained. The prosecutor accuses him of conspiring to transfer 29.8 billion won ($26 million) to Choi\u2019s organizations in return for favors. Those allegedly included currying support from the government-backed National Pension Service for a 2015 merger of Cheil Industries Inc. and Samsung C&T Corp. That deal -- which cemented Lee\u2019s control -- was narrowly approved over the opposition of activist investor Paul Elliott Singer. \n \n Other charges against Lee include hiding assets overseas, perjury and hiding criminal profits. Samsung said Monday it disagrees with Park\u2019s findings. \u201cSamsung has not paid bribes nor made improper requests seeking favors. Future court proceedings will reveal the truth,\u201d it said in a statement. \n \n The special prosecution\u2019s investigation moved much faster than it would have in jurisdictions such as the U.S.: even initial investigations into then-President Bill Clinton\u2019s relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky took the better part of a year. Park had sought, but failed to get, a one-month extension to a 90-day investigation deadline he was given. Wrapping up his investigation, the prosecutor on Monday partly blamed the timeframe for rendering his probe \u201chalf complete.\u201d \n \n Lee was absent from Thursday\u2019s hearing, which is designed to hammer out procedures that govern the trial. He\u2019s hired Bae, Kim & Lee LLC, one of the country\u2019s biggest law firms, for his defense, after having been represented during the investigation by a former judge who specialized in criminal cases and tax lawsuits. Lee\u2019s lawyers declined to speak to reporters after the hearing. \n \n Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. \n \n If South Korea\u2019s constitutional court approves the president\u2019s impeachment, Park will lose her immunity and an election will follow within two months. The president has so far refused to be questioned by prosecutors over suspicions that she asked Lee to support Choi financially. She\u2019s even barred investigators from entering the Blue House, the palatial Korean seat of power.

    "document": "Fidget spinners are one of the hottest new trends of the year, but ahead of the holiday shopping season, a new report by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a consumer advocacy organization, says testing found dangerous levels of lead in some. \n \n The safety group is not aware of any reported cases of kids getting lead poisoning from fidget spinners, but they urge awareness and transparency on the part of the retailers, especially when putting the items in children's toy sections, reports CBS News correspondent Anna Werner. \n \n The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there is no safe level of lead when it comes to children. It can cause serious health problems, including brain damage.

Now, the mother of four helps other parents learn more about products that may contain lead. \n \n Her \"Lead Safe Mama\" Facebook page has more than 15,000 followers. She tests consumer products that concerned parents send to her, including hundreds of fidget spinners. She said many of them had concerning levels of lead. \n \n \"It's on the center, it's the part you're interacting with so it's definitely a hazard for children,\" Rubin said. \n \n Rubin's blog caught the attention of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. They tested 12 fidget spinners found in children's toy aisles in Target stores across the country. \n \n \n \n Two of the products tested with high levels of lead. One contained levels reaching 33,000 parts per million. That's 300 times higher than the legal limit for children's products. \n \n \"They should take these toys off the shelves,\" said Kara Cook Schultz, U.S. PIRG's toxics program director. \n \n \"The reason that lead is a large concern \u2013 especially in children's products \u2013 is that when children are exposed to high levels of lead they can experience things like memory loss, learning disabilities,\" she said. \n \n Tamara Rubin \n \n When the group contacted Target and asked them to take the product off the shelves, Target declined, saying the two products are not designed for children. \n \n According to the packaging, they are marked for ages 14 and up, and Target says, \"They are not defined by the Consumer Product Safety Commission as toys\" and as a result \"are not required to meet children's product standards.\" \n \n The toy's manufacturer, Bulls-i-Toy, similarly stated in a letter to the safety group: \"The products in question are clearly labeled 'ages 14+'\u2026there are no mandatory CPSC (Consumer Product Safety Commission) requirements for it.\" \n \n The CPSC says fidget spinners marketed to children under the age of 12 would be subject to federal testing regulations including lead testing, but those marketed for use over age 12 are considered \"general use products,\" which would not be subject to those same tests. U.S. PIRG is pushing to change the guidelines for these popular gadgets. \n \n CBS News reached out to Bulls-i-Toy for comment but has not heard back. ||||| - High levels of lead have been found in one of the more popular gadgets this year: fidget spinners. \n \n In recent lab results, the U.S. PIRG Education Fund found two fidget spinners sold at Target have \u201cextremely high levels of lead.\u201d The advocacy group requested Target and its developer, Bulls i Toys, LLC to recall the products and investigate the how lead seeped into them. \n \n The two fidget spinners containing the lead are, \u201cFidget Wild Premium Spinner Brass,\u201d and \u201cFidget Wild Premium Spinner Metal.\u201d \n \n According to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, lead's toxicity resulted in its ban in household paints and products marketed to children in 1978. Exposure to children is damaging because it can impact development, and any amount of lead in a child\u2019s blood is unsafe. It can affect nearly every body system. \n \n U.S. PIRG also called on the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to reclassify fidget spinners as toys, rather than its current category of general use products. The organization argues that the two fidget spinners are marketed towards children. On Target\u2019s website, the \u201cFidget Wild Premium Spinner Bass\u201d is recommended for ages 14 and over, as well as, 6 and over. \n \n CPSC could hold the products to federal standards for lead if classified as a toy. Children products must not contain more than 100 parts per million (ppm) of total lead in \"accessible parts,\" according to federal requirements. \n \n In the report, the lab results were tested twice to confirm the results. For the \"Fidget Wild Premium Spinner Brass,\" the center circle tested for 33,000 ppm of lead, and the arm tested for 22,000 ppm of lead. The center circle of the \"Fidget Wild Premium Spinner Metal\" was tested for 1,300 ppm of lead and the arm tested for 520 ppm of lead. \n \n While U.S. PIRG notified the CPSC, the agency held firm that the fidget spinners are not toys. \n \n In the meantime, U.S. PIRG still recommends for adults and children to stop using the fidget spinners. The report did not address whether there have been any injuries after a product purchase. \n \n View the full report here. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

This inexpensive and addictive little toy is already the topic of choking hazard warnings by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. And Thursday morning the US Public Interest Research Group revealed that some of the spinners sold at Target (TGT) contain dangerously high levels of lead. \n \n The Fidget Wild Premium Spinner Brass tested at 33,000 parts per million for lead -- some 300 times the 100 parts per million allowable for children's toys. The lead level in another model, the Fidget Wild Premium Spinner in Metal, tested at 1,300 parts per million. \n \n The response from Target and the manufacturer: These particular spinners are recommended for consumers over the age of 14. That means CPSC lead restrictions for children don't apply, according to the companies. Products marketed to those over the age of 12 have no specific lead-level prohibitions. \n \n \"The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has reviewed and explicitly defined fidget spinners as 'general use products.' They are not defined by the CPSC as toys,\" said Target spokesman Lee Henderson in a prepared statement. \n \n Fidget Spinner craze sweeping the nation \n \n Noting that US PIRG had provided Target with its lead testing results, Henderson added that the retailer's product safety team reviewed the consumer advocacy group's data and decided there was no need to pull the products from its shelves or website. \n \n \"The two fidget spinners cited in their letter are clearly marked on the package as 'appropriate for customers ages 14 and older,' and are not marketed to children,\" Henderson said in an email. \"As a result, the fidget spinners identified are not regulated as toys or children's products and are not required to meet children's product standards.\" \n \n The manufacturer, Bulls-I-Toy, said in a letter to US PIRG that because the product packaging says this spinner model is for youngsters who are at least 14-years-old, \"There are no mandatory CPSC requirements for it.\" \n \n Regardless of how the CPSC classifies these spinners, they're marketed as toys for kids, said Kara Cook-Shultz, toxics director at US PIRG. Not only are they sold in the toy aisles, alongside the spinners sold to 6-year-olds, until Thursday, the description of the brass spinner noted that the gadget has an \"educational focus\" and is appropriate for ages \"6 and up,\" on Target's website. \n \n After publication of this story, Target updated its website to reflect that the toy was appropriate for ages 14 and up, which matches the age range on the product packaging. \n \n \"All fidget spinners have play value as children's toys regardless of labeling,\" said Cook-Schultz. \"We can't sit idly by while children play with these toxic toys. And, yes, they are toys.\" \n \n Lead poisoning is considered most dangerous for young children because their rapidly growing bodies absorb the substance more readily, and they're more likely to put products in their mouths and near their noses, where the lead is most easily ingested. But lead is dangerous for everyone. \n \n In children, lead can lead to hyperactivity, lack of appetite, behavior problems and learning disabilities. In adults, lead poisoning leads to brain and nervous system ailments, stomach and kidney problems, as well as high blood pressure, weakness, muscle problems and headaches, according to WebMD. \n \n Some lead exposure victims facing new threat as adults \n \n Target's spokesman failed to comment about why the retailer would sell a product that could be dangerous for adults. A spokesman for Bulls-I-Toy said the company's products meet CPSC guidelines. When a reporter noted that there are no lead guidelines for adult products, he reiterated: \"As a company, we follow the guidelines issued by the CPSC.\" \n \n Meanwhile, the CPSC has been warning about other spinner hazards. \n \n \"As the agency investigates some reported incidents associated with the popular product, fidget spinner users or potential buyers should take some precautions,\" said CPSC Acting Chairwoman Anne Marie Buerkle in an August statement. \n \n Some of the pieces can break off and create choking hazards, she said. Moreover, light-up spinners often contain lithium coin cell batteries. If swallowed, these batteries can cause severe internal burns. Several reports have also said the devices can catch on fire while charging. \n \n The CPSC noted that the agency classifies most spinners as \"general use\" products, rather than children's toys. Thus, they're not required to meet a variety of toy safety standards, including those that limit lead or phthalates content. \n \n US PIRG's Cook-Schultz said the debate about whether the lead-laced products are a child's toy or an adult \"stress-reliever\" is beside the point: \"These products are not safe,\" she said. \"Let's get them off the shelves.\" ||||| By Dev Gowda and Kara Cook-Schultz, U.S. PIRG Education Fund \n \n Introduction \n \n The negative health effects of lead poisoning are well known. Unfortunately, lead remains a problem in our everyday lives. While much attention has been focused on tainted drinking water, such as the lead crisis in Flint, Mich., lead still remains a problem in toys. While lead in toys has become less prevalent in recent years, U.S. PIRG Education Fund tested several models of one of today\u2019s hottest toys, fidget spinners, for the toxic heavy metal. Laboratory results indicated that two fidget spinners purchased at Target and distributed by Bulls i Toy, L.L.C. contained extremely high levels of lead. \n \n U.S. PIRG Education Fund calls on Target and Bulls i Toy to immediately recall these two fidget spinners and investigate how such high levels of lead were found in these toys. Also, we call on the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to classify these fidget spinners as toys and hold them to federal standards for lead in children\u2019s products. \n \n Background on Lead \n \n Elemental lead is a metal occurring naturally in soils and rocks. It has a variety of commercial uses including in batteries, plastics, and radiation shielding. In the past, lead was also added to gasoline and paint. Because of lead\u2019s toxicity, in 1978 it was banned in household paint, in products marketed to children, and in dishes and cookware in the United States. Lead is not discernible by sight or smell. \n \n Lead exposure is particularly damaging for young children because of its impact on development. Even low levels of lead in blood have been shown to undermine IQ, attentiveness, and academic achievement. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) makes clear that any amount of lead in a child\u2019s blood is unsafe. Moreover, since the effects of lead exposure cannot be reversed, it is especially important to prevent lead exposure to children in the first place. \n \n Unfortunately, toys can pose a risk in part because lead is used in other countries and can be found in imported products. Additionally, lead may be incorporated into plastic. Lead is used to soften plastic and make it more flexible, but when the plastic is exposed to sunlight, air, or detergents, the chemical bond between the lead and plastic breaks down, forming lead dust. Children can inhale or come in contact with this dust when they put toys in or near their mouths. \n \n Federal Standards for Lead \n \n With a few exceptions, federal law requires that all children\u2019s products manufactured after August 2011 contain no more than 100 parts per million (ppm) of total lead content in all accessible parts. The CPSC defines accessible parts as parts that a child could reach through \u201cnormal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of the product.\u201d \n \n Paint or similar surface coatings on all children\u2019s products are subject to a limit of 90 ppm of total lead. (Household paints are also subject to this rule.) \n \n Exceptions to these standards include metal components of bicycles, which cannot contain more than 300 ppm of lead. Components in electronic devices, inaccessible parts, and other items are exempt from the lead standard. \n \n Note that these limits do not meet the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), which recommends that all products intended for use by children contain no more than trace amounts of lead, defined as 40 ppm, the high end of typical lead concentrations in uncontaminated soil. \n \n Lead Found in Fidget Spinners \n \n Several fidget spinners were tested for lead content by a CPSC-accredited laboratory. The fidget spinners were analyzed in accordance with CPSC-CH-E1001-8.3 using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP/MS). The toys that tested for high levels of lead were then re-tested a second time to confirm the results. The results of the second test are included in this report. \n \n The lab results showed two fidget spinners contained extremely high levels of lead: \n \n \n \n Fidget Wild Premium Spinner Brass: \n \n The center circle tested for 33,000 ppm of lead. \n \n The arm tested for 22,000 ppm of lead. \n \n This fidget spinner was purchased at Target and is distributed by Bulls i Toy, LLC, located in Des Moines, Iowa. Although the box says for ages 14+, the Target.com website where it is available for sale says both that it is for children 6+ and 14+ and specifically states that it is \u201cframed as a toy\u201d. See screenshot from Target.com website below. Moreover, it was found in the toy aisles of numerous Target stores throughout the country and is marketed as a toy. Below is a picture of the Fidget Wild Premium Spinner Brass in the toy aisle of a Target store. Therefore, we believe that this product should be treated as a toy since it\u2019s marketed for use by children under 12 years. \n \n Screenshot from Target.com website. \n \n Fidget spinner in Target store. \n \n \n \n Fidget Wild Premium Spinner Metal: \n \n The center circle tested for 1,300 ppm of lead. \n \n The arm tested for 520 ppm of lead. \n \n This fidget spinner was purchased at Target and is distributed by Bulls i Toy, LLC, located in Des Moines, Iowa. Although it says it\u2019s for ages 14+, it was found in the toy aisles of numerous Target stores throughout the country and is marketed as a toy. Therefore, it should be held to federal lead standards for children\u2019s products. \n \n Furthermore, the BullsiToy.com website where Fidget Wild products are found is clearly a website for toys. Below is a screenshot of the Bulls i Toy website. The products they sell are marketed towards children and should, therefore, be classified as toys by the CPSC. \n \n Alarmingly, when U.S. PIRG Education Fund notified the CPSC about the elevated lead levels in the fidget spinners, the CPSC responded in an email (screenshot below) that these fidget spinners are general use products, not toys, so the CPSC will not hold them to federal lead standards. When we alerted Target and the toy's distributor to our findings, they pointed to the same CPSC statement and refused to address the problem. Belying that statement, U.S. PIRG Education Fund staff found these fidget spinners sold in the toy aisle of Target stores and on the Target.com website, which includes a statement that the product is intended for children ages 6 and up. Furthermore, common sense dictates that fidget spinners are meant for kids and therefore should be classified as toys. U.S. PIRG Education Fund calls on the CPSC to classify these fidget spinners as toys and hold them to the federal standard for lead in children\u2019s products. \n \n Recommendations \n \n For consumers: \n \n Adults and children alike should stop using these fidget spinners. \n \n Call on the CPSC to classify all fidget spinners as toys so that they will be held to federal standards for lead in children\u2019s products. \n \n Subscribe to email recall updates from the CPSC and other U.S. government safety agencies available at www.recalls.gov. \n \n For Target, Corp and Bulls I Toy, L.L.C.: \n \n Immediately recall these fidget spinners and remove from store shelves and Target.com website. \n \n Issue a public statement about the recall due to high lead content. \n \n Investigate how these toys came to contain such extremely high levels of lead and make findings public. \n \n Ensure that other fidget spinners sold or manufactured do not contain high levels of lead. \n \n Notify customers who purchased these fidget spinners, where contact information is available, that they should stop using the fidget spinner due to high levels of lead and offer a return for full refund. \n \n For U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission: \n \n Ensure that all fidget spinners are classified as toys and that they must meet federal regulations for children\u2019s products. \n \n Investigate any misleading marketing by Target, Corp. and Bulls i Toy, L.L.C. and take appropriate action. Although the labels on the toy boxes say 14+, they\u2019re clearly being marketed to children under 12 years. \n \n Conduct testing for other fidget spinners, especially those labeled \u201cbrass\u201d or \u201cmetal\u201d, for lead. \n \n U.S. PIRG Education Fund is a consumer and public health non-profit organization. We work to educate the public about dangers in toys, and for more than 30 years we have published an annual report titled Trouble in Toyland. Our survey of toys has led to more than 150 recalls and other enforcement actions.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A maker of one of the hottest products of the year has just found itself in a bucket of hot water. According to a consumer advocacy group, two fidget spinners supplied to Target by Iowa-based Bulls-i-Toy contain lead at up to 330 times the federal legal limit for toys. Inspired by a 15,000-strong Facebook group run by a woman who tests consumer products for lead, the US Public Interest Research Group tested 12 fidget spinners sold by Target and found two with unsafe lead levels, reports CBS News. Fidget Wild Premium Spinner Brass was found to contain 33,000 parts per million at its center, while Fidget Wild Premium Spinner Metal contained 1,300 parts per million, reports the Washington Post. Federal laws limit lead in \"children's products\" to 100 parts per million. The group is now asking Target to remove the products and recall those already sold. But Target isn't complying, arguing the Consumer Product Safety Commission classifies fidget spinners as \"general use products\" marketed to users 14 and up, making them exempt from regulations on toys. Bulls-i-Toy seconds that, noting the products are \"clearly labeled\" for ages 14 and up. But FOX 13 notes the fidget spinners sold in Target toy aisles had actually been listed on its website at one point with a manufacturer's recommendation for users \"6 years and up.\" Given that lead exposure can cause learning disabilities in children, among many other issues, US PIRG's toxics director maintains \"these products are not safe,\" per CBS. (They're also a choking hazard.)",

    "document": "Retired Army Gen. Alexander Haig, who held influential positions in the U.S. military and government and who as White House chief of staff shepherded Richard M. Nixon toward peacefully resigning the presidency, died Saturday at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore of complications from an infection. He was 85. \n \n Presidents Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter sent the four-star general to Europe as supreme commander of NATO. Ronald Reagan made him secretary of state, a brief and stormy appointment in which he famously tried to assert command after the attempted assassination of the president. And Gen. Haig himself, a tall man with blue eyes who kept his chin-up military bearing long after he left the service, ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 1988. \n \n In a statement, President Obama said Gen. Haig \"exemplified our finest warrior-diplomat tradition of those who dedicate their lives to public service.\" \n \n Gen. Haig's influence peaked in his late 40s, during Nixon's last 16 months in office, when brewing developments in the Watergate scandal damaged and increasingly distracted the president. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger famously told Gen. Haig to keep the country together while he held the world together during one of the greatest constitutional crises in the nation's history. Special prosecutor Leon Jaworski, and many others, called Gen. Haig the \"37 1/2 president.\" \n \n Gen. Haig, untainted by the botched break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters, took over as chief of staff in May 1973 from H.R. \"Bob\" Haldeman, who would spend 18 months in prison for his role in the Watergate scandal. When the public learned about the secret Oval Office taping system, which would eventually implicate Nixon in the coverup, Gen. Haig, as he acknowledged later, urged the president to destroy the tapes. \n \n When Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox, Jaworski's predecessor, pursued his investigation too aggressively for Nixon's comfort, the president dispatched Gen. Haig in October 1973 to instruct the acting attorney general, William D. Ruckelshaus, to fire Cox. \"Your commander in chief has given you an order,\" Gen. Haig told him. \n \n Ruckelshaus refused, quitting instead in what became known as the Saturday Night Massacre. \n \n Although Gen. Haig vigorously defended the president, he realized the direness of the mounting evidence and arranged a series of meetings between Nixon, his attorneys and leading members of Congress to make Nixon understand that his position had become untenable in the summer of 1974. \n \n Gen. Haig said he thought Nixon needed to make the final decision, but he \"smoothed the way\" by presenting resignation as the only serious option, according to the account of this period in journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's 1976 book \"The Final Days.\" After the president broached the possibility of suicide, the authors noted, Gen. Haig ordered doctors to take away Nixon's tranquilizers and deny his requests for pills. \n \n Then, on Aug. 1, 1974, Gen. Haig told Vice President Ford that he should prepare to assume the presidency. Critics said later that he brokered a deal that got Nixon a pardon in exchange for stepping down. Gen. Haig maintained that he never implicitly or explicitly made such an offer. \n \n Gen. Haig stood on the White House lawn eight days later, on Aug. 9, when Nixon left town. The chief of staff had his arms folded, but he discreetly gave a thumbs-up to his disgraced boss. \n \n Powerful mentors \n \n \n \n Alexander Meigs Haig Jr. was born on Dec. 2, 1924, in the Philadelphia suburb of Bala Cynwyd, Pa. He was 10 when his father, a lawyer, died of cancer and left the family $5,000 in life insurance money. Gen. Haig was the second of three children, but he assumed an important role in family matters as the oldest male. ||||| Seven years before, Mr. Haig really had been in control. He was widely perceived as the acting president during the final months of the Nixon administration. \n \n He kept the White House running as the distraught and despondent commander in chief was driven from power by the threat of impeachment in 1974. \u201cHe was the president toward the end,\u201d William B. Saxbe, the United States attorney general in 1974, was quoted as saying in \u201cNixon: An Oral History of His Presidency\u201d (HarperCollins, 1994). \u201cHe held that office together.\u201d \n \n Henry A. Kissinger , his mentor and master in the Nixon White House, also said the nation owed Mr. Haig its gratitude for steering the ship of state through dangerous waters in the final days of the Nixon era. \u201cBy sheer willpower, dedication and self-discipline, he held the government together,\u201d Mr. Kissinger wrote in the memoir \u201cYears of Upheaval.\u201d \n \n Mr. Haig took pride in his cool handling of a constitutional crisis without precedent. \n \n \u201cThere were no tanks,\u201d he said during a hearing on his nomination as secretary of state in 1981. \u201cThere were not any sandbags outside the White House.\u201d \n \n Serving the Nixon White House from 1969 to 1974, Mr. Haig went from colonel to four-star general without holding a major battlefield command, an extraordinary rise with few if any precedents in American military history. \n \n But the White House was its own battlefield in those years. He won his stars through his tireless service to President Richard M. Nixon and Mr. Nixon\u2019s national security adviser, Mr. Kissinger. \n \n Mr. Haig never lost his will. But he frequently lost his composure as Mr. Reagan\u2019s secretary of state. As a consequence, he lost both his job and his standing in the American government. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Mr. Nixon had privately suggested to the Reagan transition team that Mr. Haig would make a great secretary of state. Upon his appointment, Mr. Haig declared himself \u201cthe vicar of foreign policy\u201d \u2014 in the Roman Catholic Church , to which he belonged, the pope is the \u201cvicar of Christ\u201d \u2014 but he soon became an apostate in the new administration. \n \n He alienated his affable commander in chief and the vice president, George H. W. Bush , whose national security aide, Donald P. Gregg, described Mr. Haig as \u201ca cobra among garter snakes.\u201d \n \n Mr. Haig served for 17 months before Mr. Reagan dismissed him with a one-page letter on June 24, 1982. \n \n Those months were marked by a largely covert paramilitary campaign against Central American leftists, a heightening of nuclear tensions with the Soviet Union, and dismay among American allies about the lurching course of American foreign policy. \n \n Sixteen months after his departure came the deaths of 241 American Marines , sailors and soldiers in a terrorist bombing in Beirut and, two days later, the American invasion of the Caribbean nation of Grenada . \n \n \u201cHis tenure as secretary of state was very traumatic,\u201d John M. Poindexter , later Mr. Reagan\u2019s national security adviser, recalled in the oral history \u201cReagan: The Man and His Presidency\u201d (Houghton Mifflin, 1998). \u201cAs a result of this constant tension that existed between the White House and the State Department about who was going to be responsible for national security and foreign policy, we got very little done.\u201d \n \n Mr. Haig said the president had assured him that he \u201cwould be the spokesman for the U.S. government.\u201d But he came to believe \u2014 with reason \u2014 that the White House staff had banded together against him. \n \n He blamed in particular the so-called troika of James A. Baker III , Edwin Meese III and Michael K. Deaver. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n \u201cReagan was a cipher,\u201d Mr. Haig said with evident bitterness. \u201cThese men were running the government.\u201d \n \n He reflected: \u201cHaving been a White House chief of staff, and having lived in the White House under great tension, you know that the White House attracts extremely ambitious people. Those who get to the top are usually prepared to go to extraordinary lengths to get there.\u201d \n \n Mr. Haig briefly considered running for president in 1980 and became a candidate in 1988, but his campaign attracted virtually no popular support. \n \n A spokesman for Johns Hopkins, Gary Stephenson, said Mr. Haig\u2019s death was caused by staphylococcal infection that he had before his admission to the hospital. Mr. Haig is survived by his wife, the former Patricia Fox, 81; their three children, Alexander Patrick Haig Sr. and Barbara Haig, both of Washington, and Brian Haig of Hopewell, N.J.; and eight grandchildren, according to the Rev. Frank Haig, 81, his brother and a professor emeritus of physics at Loyola University Maryland in Baltimore. \n \n Photo \n \n Father Haig said the Army was coordinating a Mass at Fort Myer in Washington and an interment at Arlington National Cemetery, but both would be delayed by about two weeks due to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq . \n \n In a statement issued Saturday, President Obama said: \u201cToday we mourn the loss of Alexander Haig, a great American who served our country with distinction. General Haig exemplified our finest warrior-diplomat tradition of those who dedicate their lives to public service.\u201d \n \n Alexander Meigs Haig Jr. was born in Philadelphia on Dec. 2, 1924, the son of a lawyer and a homemaker. At 22, he graduated from West Point , ranking 214th of 310 members of the class of 1947. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Douglas MacArthur, the supreme allied commander and American viceroy of the Far East. \n \n In 1950, Mr. Haig married the general\u2019s daughter. \n \n Introduction to War \n \n Mr. Haig\u2019s first taste of war was brutal. In the first months of the Korean War, he served on the staff of Maj. Gen. Edward M. Almond, chief of staff of the Far Eastern Command. Official Army histories depict General Almond as a terror to his underlings and as one of General MacArthur\u2019s most uncompromising disciples. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Following orders, General Almond sent thousands of American soldiers north toward the Chinese border in November 1950. They met a ferocious surprise counterattack from a far larger Chinese force. \n \n General Almond and Lieutenant Haig flew to the forward outpost of an American task force on Nov. 28, where the general pinned a medal on a lieutenant colonel\u2019s parka, told him the Chinese were only stragglers, and then flew off. Of that task force, once 2,500 strong, some 1,000 were killed, wounded, captured or left to die. In all, within two weeks, American forces in Korea took 12,975 casualties, in one of the worst routs in American military history. \n \n After the Korean War, the young officer served at the Pentagon and eventually become a deputy special assistant to Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara . He served in Vietnam in 1966 and 1967 as a battalion and brigade commander of the First Infantry Division, and received the Distinguished Service Cross. \n \n In 1969, Colonel Haig became a military assistant on the staff of Mr. Kissinger\u2019s National Security Council . He distinguished himself as the hardest worker in an ambitious and talented cohort. Soon he was a brigadier general and Mr. Kissinger\u2019s deputy. \n \n Vietnam consumed General Haig. He made 14 trips to Southeast Asia from 1970 to 1973. He later said that Mr. Kissinger \u201cgot snookered\u201d in negotiations with the enemy, and that he would have chosen to be more forceful. \u201cThat is how Eisenhower settled Korea,\u201d Mr. Haig said. \u201cHe told them he was going to nuke them. In Vietnam, we didn\u2019t have to use nuclear weapons; all we had to do was to act like a nation.\u201d \n \n Then Watergate consumed the White House. In 1973, after a brief stint as the Army\u2019s vice chief of staff, General Haig was summoned back as chief of staff, replacing H. R. Haldeman, who later went to prison. \n \n All this, in the course of a few weeks in the fall of 1973, fell on Mr. Haig\u2019s head: \n \n Vice President Spiro T. Agnew pleaded no contest to taking bribes. The next man in line under the Constitution, House Speaker Carl Albert, was being treated for alcoholism . The president himself, by some accounts, was drinking heavily. War broke out in the Middle East . When the president tried to fire the Watergate special prosecutor, Archibald Cox , rather than surrender his secret White House tapes, the attorney general, Elliot L. Richardson, and his deputy, William D. Ruckelshaus, resigned. Impeachment loomed. \n \n What began with the arrest of several men breaking into Democratic headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington in June 1972 had poisoned the presidency. Days after the break-in, the president and his closest aides had discussed how to cover up their role and how to obtain hush money for the burglars. The discussions, secretly taped by the president, were evidence of obstruction of justice. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n General Haig was one of the first people, if not the very first person, to read transcripts of the tapes the president had withheld from the special prosecutor. \u201cWhen I finished reading it,\u201d he says in \u201cNixon: An Oral History,\u201d \u201cI knew that Nixon would never survive \u2014 no way.\u201d \n \n On Aug. 1, 1974, the general went to Vice President Gerald R. Ford and discussed the possibility of a pardon for the president. Mr. Nixon left office a week later; the pardon came the next month. Public outrage was deep. Mr. Haig soon departed. \n \n After leaving the White House in October 1974, he became supreme allied commander in Europe , the overseer of NATO . In 1979, he resigned and retired from the Army. He served for a year as president of United Technologies . \n \n A \u201cHaig for President\u201d committee was formed but dissolved in 1980. Mr. Haig made a full-fledged run for the Republican nomination in 1988. But he placed last among the six Republican candidates in Iowa , where he barely campaigned, and he withdrew before the New Hampshire primary. He had been, he said, \u201cthe darkest of the dark horses.\u201d \n \n In his 80s, Mr. Haig ran Worldwide Associates, a firm offering \u201cstrategic advice\u201d on global commerce. He also appeared on Fox News as a military and political analyst. \n \n His Way With Words \n \n He had a unique way with words. In a 1981 \u201cOn Language\u201d column, William Safire of The New York Times , a veteran of the Nixon White House, called it \u201chaigravation.\u201d \n \n Nouns became verbs or adverbs: \u201cI\u2019ll have to caveat my response, Senator.\u201d (Caveat is Latin for \u201clet him beware.\u201d In English, it means \u201cwarning.\u201d In Mr. Haig\u2019s lexicon, it meant to say something with a warning that it might or might not be so.) \n \n Haigspeak could be subtle: \u201cThere are nuance-al differences between Henry Kissinger and me on that.\u201d It could be dramatic: \u201cSome sinister force\u201d had erased one of Mr. Nixon\u2019s subpoenaed Watergate tapes, creating an 18 1/2- minute gap. Sometimes it was an emblem of the never-ending battle between politics and the English language: \u201ccareful caution,\u201d \u201cepistemologically-wise,\u201d \u201csaddle myself with a statistical fence.\u201d \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n But he could also speak with clarity and conviction about the presidents he served, and about his own role in government. Mr. Nixon would always be remembered for Watergate, he said, \u201cbecause the event had such major historic consequences for the country: a fundamental discrediting of respect for the office; a new skepticism about politics in general, which every American feels.\u201d \n \n Mr. Reagan, he said, would be remembered for having had \u201cthe good fortune of having been president when the Evil Empire began to unravel.\u201d But, he went on, \u201cto consider that standing tall in Grenada, or building Star Wars, brought the Russians to their knees is a distortion of historic reality. The internal contradictions of Marxism brought it to its knees.\u201d \n \n He was brutally candid about his own run for office and his subsequent distaste for political life. \u201cNot being a politician, I think I can say this: The life of a politician in America is sleaze,\u201d he told the authors of \u201cNixon: An Oral History.\u201d \n \n \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it until I started to run for office,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is hardly a straight guy in the business. As Nixon always said to me \u2014 and he took great pride in it \u2014 \u2018Al, I never took a dollar. I had somebody else do it.\u2019 \u201d",

(Published Saturday, June 15, 2013) \n \n In a final message before taking his life, the lead building inspector responsible for a Center City building that collapsed last week said he was to blame for the deadly disaster. \n \n \"It was my fault. I should have looked at those guys working, and I didn't,\" Ronald Wagenhoffer said in a video recorded on his cell phone. \n \n NBC10 Philadelphia has learned the 52-year-old veteran Philadelphia Licenses & Inspections staffer recorded the one-minute long message for his family. \n \n Wagenhoffer was found dead around 9:30 Wednesday night of an apparent suicide, city officials confirmed at a press conference Thursday. \n \n Reaction to Final Words of Inspector Before Suicide \n \n We have reaction to an NBC10 exclusive report, detailing the final words of an L & I inspector who killed himself following last week's deadly building collapse. Only NBC10 has confirmed that the inspector admitted he never set foot on the construction site before signing off on the project. NBC10's Harry Hairston reports. (Published Friday, June 14, 2013) \n \n Law enforcement sources say Wagenhoffer shot himself once in the chest inside his pickup truck along a wooded section of the 100 block of Shawmont Avenue in the Roxborough neighborhood of Philadelphia. That's less than a mile from his home. \n \n In the video, Wagenhoffer says he couldn't sleep and blamed himself for the building collapse at 2136 Market Streets that killed six and injured 13 when the building collapsed onto a store on June 5. \n \n He admitted he never truly inspected an adjacent work site after a citizen complained about safety concerns, although he reported there were no violations found. \n \n \"When I saw it was too late. I should have parked my truck and went over there but I didn't. I'm sorry,\" Wagenhoffer said in the message. \n \n City officials said Wagenhoffer was sent to the demolition site of 2134 Market Street on May 14 -- that's adjacent to the building that collapsed at 2136 Market Street. \n \n The inspection was set to take place after Center City resident Stephen Field complained to the city's 311 call center about a lack of safety equipment on workers and adequate protection of the sidewalk. The city has been saying for a week that no issues were found. \n \n Building Inspector Admits Fault \n \n The man responsible for inspecting the building that collapsed last week in Center City, admits he was at fault in a cellphone video he left for his family. Ronald Wagenhoffer apparently committed suicide last night. NBC10's Nefertiti Jaquez uncovers new information in the case. (Published Thursday, June 13, 2013) \n \n Last Wednesday, the four-story outer wall of 2136 Market Street crumbled onto the Salvation Army Thrift Store next door. Six people were killed in the collapse -- three employees and three patrons. The wall also buried 13 others who were in different areas throughout the store, including the basement. They were eventually rescued by citizens and first responders. \n \n Excavator operator Kane R. Robert, also known as Sean Benschop, stands charged in the collapse. Investigators with the District Attorney's homicide unit say he tested positive for the pain killer Percocet and marijuana on the day of the collapse. They allege he was in no condition to operate heavy machinery. A grand jury has been convened to investigate the circumstances surrounding the collapse. \n \n L&I records also show Wagenhoffer completed and passed an initial inspection at 2136 Market Street on Feb. 25. \n \n City officials said that fellow employees and L&I Commissioner Carlton Williams reached out to Wagenhoffer in the days after the collapse. \n \n \"This man did nothing wrong,\" Deputy Mayor Everett Gillison said at a press conference Thursday. \"The department did what it was supposed to do under the code that existed at the time.\" \n \n In a tweet posted Friday afternoon, Mayor Nutter's Press Secretary Mark McDonald refuted NBC10's reporting of the video message. \n \n \"NBC10 falsely stated that L&I inspector said of collapse -- \"It was my fault.\" That is a total lie,\" he wrote. \n \n NBC10 Vice President of News Anzio Williams said, \"We have seen the video. We are standing behind our journalism.\" In a phone conversation with Williams, McDonald maintained his belief that the report was inaccurate. \n \n A source close to the investigation who did not want to be named because they aren't authorized to speak publicly about the case, said Wagenhoffer had been grieving for days. They said Wagenhoffer did not take any time off after the collapse because he thought sticking to his work routine might help him deal with the tragedy. \n \n On Thursday, Nutter, who is in Chicago, was asked if Wagenhoffer should have been placed on leave after the building collapse. \n \n \"Each of us deals with our grief and sorrow and any sense of responsibility in a different way. I'm not going to second guess his judgment to keep working,\" Nutter responded. He said Wagenhoffer had been in constant contact with his supervisor and was offered time off, but declined. \n \n Mayor Nutter Responds to Inspector's Suicide \n \n The lead inspector of a Center City building that collapsed last week commits suicide. Ronald Wagenhofferr was the last inspector to examine the building that collapsed, but city officials say he did nothing wrong. NBC10's Daralene Jones caught up with the mayor and asked why the inspector was still working after such a tragedy. (Published Thursday, June 13, 2013) \n \n \"I think what you have here is a 16-year-employee who cared very deeply about his job,\" said Nutter. \"We don't know all the things that may have been going through his mind.\" \n \n Commissioner Williams called Wagenhoffer an outstanding employee. \n \n \u201cHe was a dedicated civil servant who did his job,\" he said. \"He started in the Department of Public Property and moved his way up through the ranks as one of our top code officials in the Department of Licenses & Inspections.\" \n \n Nutter said the city is also encouraging other employees to get emotional support if they need it. \n \n \"Obviously I don't know why this happened, but we've tried to send a message out certainly to all of our public employees who are deeply affected by this, especially those who worked with Ron,\" Nutter said. \n \n Wagenhoffer leaves behind a wife, Michele and a son. \n \n Mayor Nutter Astounded Over Inspector's Suicide \n \n Mayor Michael Nutter said Ron Wagenhoffer was a man who cared deeply about his job and had a great love for the city of Philadelphia. Wagenhoffer shot himself to death last night. He was the lead inspector on the building that was under demolition when it collapsed last week onto a Salvation Army thrift store, killing six people and injuring 13 others.

Wednesday a building under demolition collapsed onto a neighboring thrift store, killing six people and... (Associated Press) \n \n Nadine White, a 54-year-old mother of three, had worked at the thrift store for about eight months. She was in the back of the store when she \"heard a rumble and a wall collapsed on her,\" attorney Larry Bendesky said. \n \n A second plaintiff, Linda Bell, joined the lawsuit. Bell, a 50-year-old mother of three, was shopping when the collapse happened. She fell into the basement and was covered by rubble for more than an hour. \n \n \"She's pretty shook up, in a lot of pain,\" her attorney Joseph Marrone said. \n \n Their lawsuit against demolition contractor Griffin Campbell gained speed as the rescue operation from Wednesday's collapse wound down. \n \n Robert Mongeluzzi, another of White's attorneys, said Campbell violated several federal safety regulations, while building owner Richard Basciano should have picked a more qualified and competent contractor to do the work. \n \n \"This is the most egregious construction accident I think I've ever been involved in,\" said Mongeluzzi, who has represented hundreds of plaintiffs in construction accidents and is considered a top lawyer in the field. \n \n The lawyers received permission Friday from a judge to bring in experts to videotape and photograph the continuing demolition work by the city from a safe distance. Common Pleas Court Judge Ellen Ceisler ruled that once the site is deemed safe, experts for all parties can inspect the remaining debris. \n \n \"From what we can understand, given (Campbell's) checkered past, and what appears to be a total lack of experience and know-how, we believe that was a grossly negligent selection,\" Mongeluzzi said Thursday. \n \n A man who answered the phone Friday at Campbell's home said he was not home, and Campbell's cellphone voicemail box was full. Peter Greiner, attorney for Basciano, was in a meeting Friday and did not immediately return a call. \n \n Campbell has previously been arrested on charges involving drugs, assault and insurance fraud and has had two bankruptcy filings. His daughter, Dominique Lee, who answered the door at his home, said Thursday that he wasn't there but was \"mourning the loss of those people just like everyone else.\" \n \n The four-story building toppled onto the thrift store on Philadelphia's busy Market Street, six people, including a woman working her first day at the store. Thirteen people were injured. \n \n The collapse has brought swift and mounting fallout in a city where demolition contractors are lightly regulated. Officials have begun inspecting hundreds of demolition sites citywide, and a city councilman charged that dangerous, under-the-radar tear-downs are taking place throughout Philadelphia. \n \n The Department of Licenses and Inspections said it had 300 open demolition permits throughout the city; inspectors had visited about 30 of the sites by Thursday afternoon and planned to get to the rest by next week. \n \n The spot inspections included all four construction and demolition sites connected to Campbell. The city found violations at two of the Campbell sites and ordered a halt to the work. \n \n Councilman James Kenney, among others, called for a review of the demolition application and inspection process and demanded a stricter process for demolition companies. \n \n \"This is happening all over the city,\" he said. \"I need to know who the workers are who are there, what they know, what they don't know, how they've been trained.\" \n \n The city does check the condition of buildings to be torn down before demolition can begin _ and inspects them again after the tear-down is finished _ but does not require an inspection during demolition. A pre-demolition inspection at the site on May 14 turned up no issues, said Carlton Williams, head of the city's Department of Licenses and Inspections. \n \n Pennsylvania does not license demolition contractors, nor does the city. Williams said the city code does not require demolition contractors to show any proficiency in tearing down buildings. \n \n \"Buildings get demolished all the time in the city of Philadelphia with active buildings right next to them. ... They're done safely in this city all the time,\" Mayor Michael Nutter said Thursday. \"Something obviously went wrong here yesterday and possibly in the days leading up to it. That's what the investigation is for.\" \n \n Nutter said he was unaware of any complaints about the demolition work done by Campbell in the days before the tragedy. But the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration said it had gotten a complaint May 15 that workers at the site were at risk of falling. The complaint was still open at the time of the disaster, U.S. Labor Department spokeswoman Leni Uddyback-Fortson said. \n \n OSHA regulates the demolition industry and enforces standards meant to ensure worker safety. Among other things, its regulations forbid any wall section exceeding one story to stand alone without bracing, unless the wall was designed that way. Witnesses have said they saw a 30-foot section of unbraced wall before the collapse. \n \n A video of the demolition taken the Sunday before the collapse showed bricks raining down on the sidewalk as a worker used a backhoe and claw to remove a second-story front wall. \n \n The sidewalk and the staircase leading up from a subway stop appeared open to pedestrians despite the falling bricks. Cars and trucks could also be seen going past, just a few feet away. \n \n ___ \n \n Rubinkam reported from northeastern Pennsylvania.

A conservative federal judge in Texas on Friday, Dec. 14, 2018, ruled the Affordable Care Act \u201cinvalid\u201d on the eve of the sign-up deadline for next year. But with appeals... (Associated Press) \n \n WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A federal judge's ruling that the Obama health law is unconstitutional has landed like a stink bomb among Republicans, who've seen the politics of health care flip as Americans increasingly value the overhaul's core parts, including protections for pre-existing medical conditions and Medicaid for more low-income people. \n \n While the decision by the Republican-appointed judge in Texas was sweeping, it has little immediate practical impact because the Affordable Care Act remains in place while the legal battle continues, possibly to the Supreme Court. \n \n HealthCare.gov , the government's site for signing up, was taking applications Saturday, the deadline in most states for enrolling for coverage next year, and those benefits will take effect as scheduled Jan. 1. Medicaid expansion will proceed in Virginia, one of the latest states to accept that option. Employers will still be required to cover the young adult children of workers, and Medicare recipients will still get discounted prescription drugs. \n \n But Republicans, still stinging from their loss of the House in the midterm elections, are facing a fresh political quandary after U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor said the entire 2010 health law was invalid. \n \n Warnings about the Texas lawsuit were part of the political narrative behind Democrats' electoral gains. Health care was the top issue for about one-fourth of voters in the November election, ahead of immigration and jobs and the economy, according to VoteCast, a nationwide survey for The Associated Press. Those most concerned with health care supported Democrats overwhelmingly. \n \n In his ruling, O'Connor reasoned that the body of the law could not be surgically separated from its now-meaningless requirement for people to have health insurance. \n \n \"On the assumption that the Supreme Court upholds, we will get great, great health care for our people,\" President Donald Trump told reporters during a visit Saturday to Arlington National Cemetery. \"We'll have to sit down with the Democrats to do it, but I'm sure they want to do it also.\" \n \n Economist Gail Wilensky, who oversaw the Medicare program for President George H.W. Bush, said the state attorneys general from GOP strongholds who filed the lawsuit really weren't very considerate of their fellow Republicans. \n \n \"The fact that they could cause their fellow Republicans harm did not seem to bother them,\" said Wilensky, a critic of President Barack Obama's signature domestic achievement. \n \n \"The people who raised it are a bunch of guys who don't have serious election issues, mostly from states where saber-rattling against the ACA is fine,\" she added. \"How many elections do you have to get battered before you find another issue?\" \n \n Douglas Holtz-Eakin, top policy adviser to Republican John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign, said he was struck by the relative silence from top Republicans after the ruling issued. \n \n A prominent example: \"The House was not party to this suit, and we are reviewing the ruling and its impact,\" said AshLee Strong, spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. \n \n Republicans are \"going to have to figure out what to do,\" Holtz-Eakin said. \"If it's invalidated by the courts, it's not ... 'We're going to do it our way.' They're going to have to get together with the Democrats in the House.\" \n \n The GOP's failed effort last year to repeal the law showed there's no consensus within the party itself. \n \n Trump tweeted Friday night that \"Congress must pass a STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare and protects pre-existing conditions.\" \n \n \"Get it done!\" he told Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who is expected to be speaker in January. But Trump had no plan of his own to offer in the 2017 \"repeal and replace\" debate. \n \n Two top House Republicans issued diverging statements. \n \n Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California said \"Obamacare is a broken law,\" but added, \"I am committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make sure America's healthcare system works for all Americans.\" \n \n The third-ranking GOP leader, Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise, praised the judge's ruling and made no mention of working with Democrats, whom he accused of \"running a fear-mongering campaign\" to win control of the House last month. \n \n The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, said that if the law is ultimately overturned, then members of Congress from both parties should start over, working together. He urged maintaining provisions such as protections for pre-existing medical conditions, no lifetime dollar limits on insurance coverage, and allowing young adults to stay on parental coverage until age 26. \n \n Democrats were united in condemning the ruling. \n \n Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said voters will remember. \"What will stand is Republican ownership of such a harmful and disastrous lawsuit,\" Schumer tweeted. \n \n The next chapter in the legal case could take months to play out. \n \n A coalition of Democratic state officials led by California Attorney General Xavier Becerra will appeal O'Connor's decision, most likely to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit in New Orleans. \n \n \"The legal merits of the case are frivolous,\" said University of Michigan law professor Nicholas Bagley. \"The notion that the unconstitutionality of an unenforceable mandate somehow requires toppling the entire ACA is bonkers.\" Bagley supports the law generally, but has been critical of how it has been put into effect. ||||| CLOSE A new Reuters/Ipsos poll shows that nearly 60 percent of likely voters across the nation want the Affordable Care Act to remain in place.

(Photo: Reed Saxon, AP) \n \n On Friday, a federal judge fulfilled a wish conservatives have held for more than eight years by ruling the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, unconstitutional. \n \n U.S. District Court Judge Reed O\u2019Connor agreed with a group of 20 states with Republican governors or legislatures that argued the constitutionality of the law's individual mandate dissolved when Congress removed the tax penalty for the uninsured. \n \n In 2012, the Supreme Court upheld the law and its mandate requiring people purchase insurance on the grounds that it fell within Congress' taxation power. O\u2019Connor said when the tax penalty was removed so was the central argument upholding the 2010 law's constitutionality. His ruling declared not only the individual mandate but the entire law unconstitutional. \n \n That decision leaves Republican and Democratic lawmakers, as well as millions of Americans, wondering, \"So, what happens now?\" \n \n For the immediate future, the answer is nothing. The ACA will remain in place while the law's future is handled in the courts, a process could take months or years to resolve. People who bought coverage on the health care exchanges before Saturday's deadline will be insured for 2019. \n \n President Trump: Ruling against Obamacare offers another chance for repeal and replace \n \n 'Republicans will never stop': Obama slams GOP after ruling against Affordable Care Act \n \n The legal battle \n \n The Justice Department under President Donald Trump announced in June that it would not defend ACA's individual mandate and other provisions, such as protections for people with pre-existing conditions, but asked that the law not be struck down in its entirety. \n \n So, the Justice Department seems unlikely to appeal O'Connor's ruling. But after the Trump administration dropped its defense of the ACA, a number of Democratic states, led by California, took it up. Those states intend to appeal Friday's decision. \n \n \"The ACA has already survived more than 70 unsuccessful repeal attempts and withstood scrutiny in the Supreme Court. Today\u2019s misguided ruling will not deter us: our coalition will continue to fight in court for the health and well-being of all Americans,\" California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said Friday in response to the ruling. \n \n House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has vowed that Democrats will intervene and direct House counsel to defend the ACA when they take control of the chamber next month. \n \n The case would go the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, which is dominated 11-5 by judges who were nominated by Republican presidents. Yale Law professor Abbe Gluck said the 5th Circuit will almost certainly grant a stay, keeping O'Connor's ruling on hold pending their decision. \n \n A three-judge panel for the 5th Circuit will then accept briefs and hear oral arguments in the case before giving their decision. From there, it's possible the entire panel of 5th Circuit judges will ask to review the case. \n \n \"You'd be lucky if you had an opinion out of them before June,\" Gluck said. \n \n Whatever the 5th Circuit's decision, one side or the other is almost certain to appeal. But Gluck said she believes the \"current Supreme Court will not accept the case\" if O'Connor's decision is overturned because \"the case is extremely weak on the law and I don't think anyone on the court has the appetite for another politicized Obamacare showdown.\" \n \n If O'Connor's ruling is upheld, on the other hand, the Supreme Court \"will have to take the case.\" Barring a rare special session to hear the case, Gluck said it is most likely the Court will hear arguments in the case in early October. \n \n Severability \n \n Gluck, who called the ruling \"shocking\" in a New York Times op-ed co-authored with Case Western Reserve University School of Law professor Johnathan Adler, expects the case will be overturned and never even make it the Supreme Court. \n \n \"This case turned on a very simple and established legal principle, which conservative and liberal judges alike apply,\" she said. That principle, known as \"severability\" is that when a court rules part of a law unconstitutional, the rest of the law should stand \"unless Congress clearly indicates otherwise.\" \n \n \"Sometimes severability cases are difficult because it is hard to guess how much importance Congress attributed to one provision, especially in a lengthy law like the Affordable Care Act,\" Gluck and Adler wrote in the Times. \"But this is an easy case: It was Congress, not a court, that eliminated the mandate penalty and left the rest of the statute in place. How can a court conclude that Congress never intended the rest of the statute to exist without an operational mandate, when it was the 2017 Congress itself that decided it was fine to eliminate the penalty and leave the rest of the law intact?\" \n \n O'Connor said Republicans in Congress eliminated the tax penalty but left the rest of the law intact because they didn't have the vote for a full repeal. \n \n Gluck and Adler called that argument \"ridiculous\" and said Congress' intent has to be determined by how it votes. \n \n \"Congress thinks the law works without an operational mandate. To believe otherwise is to assume Congress enacts unworkable laws and that is not what courts are allowed to presume,\" they wrote. \n \n Market effect \n \n The legal uncertainty around the law could have negative impacts on the health insurance markets, said UCLA Law professor Jill Horwitz. \n \n \"Insurance markets depend on stability,\" said explained. \"That kind of roiling of the waters leads to an uncertain legal landscape that insurance companies don't like to operate in.\" \n \n The instability makes it difficult for insurance company executives to plan because they don't know if the exchanges will continue to function or how many people are going to be eligible to shop in them, Horwitz said. \n \n \"The rates are set for next year, but I imagine that this kind of uncertainty only is going to lead to higher prices for the year after,\" she said. \n \n \"And if it's difficult for experts to follow all the twists and turns of the state of the ACA, imagine how hard it is for somebody who's working a full-time job, trying to live their lives, not an expert in insurance markets, without the help of outreach because we've cut down on the funding for enrollment counselors,\" Horwitz said. \"Imagine how hard it is for those people just to find insurance.\" \n \n Even if O'Connor's decision is reversed by the 5th Circuit or Supreme Court, Horwitz said markets could still see price increases for three reasons. \n \n \"One is the insurance companies just don't like to live under that kind of uncertainty and so they're going to price that uncertainty into their products,\" she said. \n \n The second risk is that consumers \"are going to get the wrong message\" and, without a major effort at outreach, fewer of them will go to the insurance marketplaces. \n \n Third, it could mean that \"instead of policy makers spending their time improving the health care system for the people who need it, they're spending their time litigating this case.\" \n \n More: Trump administration touts 2019 drop in average Obamacare premiums after big increases this year \n \n Search for a legislative solution \n \n The solution offering the most stability and predictability for both insurance company and consumers would be a legislative one, Horwitz said. \n \n \"On the assumption that the Supreme Court upholds, we will get great, great health care for our people,\" President Donald Trump told reporters Saturday. \"We\u2019ll have to sit down with the Democrats to do it, but I\u2019m sure they want to do it also.\" \n \n Democrats will undoubtedly want to pass health care legislation, but getting them to agree with Trump and Senate Republicans on the specifics will be a challenge. \n \n A call for \"Medicaid for all\" and to expand a public insurance option is popular among Democrats. Health insurance, and retaining coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, was a central campaign issue for Democrats who won a House majority in the midterm election. \n \n And Democrats believe they have a political advantage in the debate. As the likely incoming Speaker Pelosi will be able to order the House counsel to intervene in the ACA without a vote. But she intends to bring one anyway to get Republicans on record, Politico reported. Schumer said Sunday he plans to push for a similar vote in the Senate, for similar reasons. \n \n But those House Democrats will need the Republican-controlled Senate to go along with any measure to make it Trump's desk in the next two years and \"Medicaid for all\" is unlikely to have the same appeal across the aisle. \n \n Republicans have expressed more willingness to keep provisions of the Affordable Care Act in place since their failed efforts to \"repeal and replace\" the law and some have suggested a more step-by-step approach. \n \n For example, keeping insurance for people with pre-existing conditions has been an area where Republicans and Democrats could work together. Other popular provisions such as parents being able to keep their children on their plan until age 26 could also possibly make it through as separate pieces of legislation. \n \n Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said Sunday that O'Connor's ruling was \"far too sweeping\" and that she believes \"it will be overturned.\" \n \n \"There are many good provisions of the law. Those should be retained,\" Collins said. \n \n Law professor Gluck said she is glad Collins and other lawmakers recognize the weak legal standing of O'Connor's ruling but fear it could lead to inaction. \n \n \"It's good that there's so much agreement among legal experts that the decision will likely be overturned, and I'm glad that message is getting out,\" she said. \"I think there's a danger in that message becoming widespread to the extent that it makes the members of Congress and the White House feel that they can just sit back and do nothing.\" \n \n Contributing: Richard Wolf \n \n More: While Republicans tried to end Obamacare, uninsured rate unchanged in Trump's first year \n \n More: Donald Trump \u2018better\u2019 at managing Obamacare than Obama, health secretary says \n \n Read or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/12/17/what-next-affordable-care-act/2330715002/",

We have concluded it is signs of disturbance, of material being dug out and put back again.\" \n \n Shakespeare's grave famously bears the poetic admonition, \"Good friend, for Jesus\u2019 sake forbear, / To dig the dust enclosed here. / Blessed be the man that spares these stones, / And cursed be he that moves my bones.\" \n \n Holy Trinity Church vicar Patrick Taylor told Sky News he is not so sure about the grave robbery theory. \n \n \"We now know much more about how Shakespeare was buried,\" Taylor said. \"We are not convinced, however, that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that his skull has been taken. \n \n \"We shall have to live with the mystery of not knowing fully what lies beneath the stone.\" \n \n Colls' team was permitted to examine the grave at Stratford's Holy Trinity Church because ground-penetrating radar technology permitted them to do so without disturbing the remains of the famous playwright. \n \n The archaeologists have also determined that Shakespeare was not buried standing up, contrary to tradition, and that he was laid to rest wrapped in a shroud rather than in a coffin. \n \n The claim that the skull was stolen was first published in a magazine in 1879. Colls said the team investigated a skull held at a church 15 miles from Stratford and found it could not be Shakespeare's. \n \n Their findings will be part of a television program broadcast in the U.K. Saturday to mark the 400th anniversary of the Bard's death. \n \n Click for more from The Guardian. \n \n Click for more from Sky News. \n \n ||||| William Shakespeare\u2019s skull is likely to have been stolen by trophy hunters, a new documentary claims. \n \n An archaeological survey of the playwright\u2019s grave at Holy Trinity Church in Stratford-upon-Avon appears to give new credence to theories that Shakespeare\u2019s grave was looted in 1794\u2014rumors of which have been debunked as myth until now. The theory was first published in The Argosy magazine in 1879. \n \n Archaeologist Kevin Colls of Staffordshire University led the investigation of Shakespeare\u2019s grave for a new documentary on the U.K.\u2019s Channel 4 to mark the 400th anniversary of the Bard\u2019s death in April. Colls and his team conducted a ground-penetrating radar (GPR) search using state-of-the-art technology. \n \n Key among their discoveries was an apparent repair to the head end of Shakespeare\u2019s burial site, indicating a previous disturbance to his final resting place. \n \n \u201cWe have Shakespeare\u2019s burial with an odd disturbance at the head end and we have a story that suggests that at some point in history someone\u2019s come in and taken the skull of Shakespeare. It\u2019s very, very convincing to me that his skull isn\u2019t at Holy Trinity at all,\u201d said Colls in the documentary. \n \n The televised investigation led Colls and his team to look into another legend: that Shakespeare\u2019s skull was sealed in a crypt inside St. Leonard\u2019s church in Worcestershire, some 15 miles away from his gravesite. However, a forensic anthropological survey conducted by Colls and his team found the skull in the crypt in fact belongs to an unknown woman, thought to be in her 70s when she died. \n \n Colls also discovered that Shakespeare and his wife Anne Hathaway had been buried in one-meter-deep shallow graves beneath the church\u2019s floor, and not further below ground in a family vault as previously thought. \n \n The GPR scan found no indication of metal, such as nails used for coffins, indicating Shakespeare was simply wrapped in a shroud rather than buried in a casket. \n \n \u201cIt was a great honor to be the first researcher to be given permission to undertake non-invasive archaeological investigations at the grave of William Shakespeare,\u201d said Colls. \n \n \u201cThe amazing project team...has produced astonishing results which are much better than I dared hoped for, and these results will undoubtedly spark discussion, scholarly debate and controversial theories for years to come,\u201d he added. \u201cEven now, thinking of the findings sends shivers down my spine.\u201d \n \n Secret History: Shakespeare\u2019s Tomb airs on Saturday at 8 p.m. on Channel 4.",

At the time, trophy hunters believed a person's genius would be apparent in his skull. Rumors also claimed that Shakespeare's skull might be hidden in a sealed crypt at another church nearby, but Colls' team investigated and found the skull there was that of a woman in her 70s. The team also discovered that Shakespeare was buried in a simple shroud, not a coffin, and that he and his wife were buried in shallow graves, not a deeper family vault as had been believed, Newsweek adds.

A r\u00e9sum\u00e9 highlighting stellar professional credentials and experience could pique the interest of a prospective employer, but it's your voice that may actually help you land the job. \n \n A new study by University of Chicago Booth School of Business Professor Nicholas Epley and Ph.D. candidate Juliana Schroeder found that when hypothetical employers and professional recruiters listened to or read job candidates' job qualifications, they rated the candidates as more competent, thoughtful and intelligent when they heard the pitch than when they read it\u2014even when the words used were exactly the same. As a result, they liked the candidate more and were more interested in hiring them. \n \n However, the addition of video did not influence evaluations beyond hearing the candidate's voice, the researchers note. \n \n \"In addition to communicating the contents of one's mind, like specific thoughts and beliefs, a person's speech conveys their fundamental capacity to think\u2014the capacity for reasoning, thoughtfulness and intellect,\" says Epley. \n \n Titled \"The Sound of Intellect: Speech Reveals a Thoughtful Mind, Increasing a Job Candidate's Appeal,\" the study will be published in an upcoming issue of The Journal of Psychological Science, the highest ranked empirical journal in the field of psychology. \n \n In a series of experiments, the researchers asked a group of Chicago Booth MBA student job candidates to develop a short pitch to the company for which they would most like to work. They created written pitches and spoken pitches (videotaped). \n \n In an initial experiment, a separate group of evaluators judged the spoken pitches by either watching and listening to the video recording, listening to the audio only, or reading a transcript of the pitch. \n \n The evaluators who heard the pitch subsequently rated the candidate as more intelligent, thoughtful and competent than the evaluators who only read a transcript of the pitch; the evaluators who watched the video pitch did not rate any differently than those who heard the pitch. In fact, evaluators who heard the pitch reported liking the candidate more and reported being significantly more likely to hire that person. \n \n In another experiment, the evaluators who listened to trained actors reading job candidates' written pitches out loud believed those candidates were more intelligent and wanted to hire them more than the evaluators who read candidates' own written pitches. \n \n Even professional recruiters (who recruit candidates from Chicago Booth) were more likely to hire the candidates whose pitches they could hear than those whose pitches they read. \n \n Epley concludes: \"When conveying intelligence, it's important for one's voice to be heard\u2014literally.\" \n \n Explore further: Employers often more interested in hiring potential playmates than the very best candidates",

(AP) \u2014 Mirroring problems with the federal health care website, people around the nation attempting to navigate the Spanish version have discovered their own set of difficulties. \n \n In this Wednesday, Jan. 8, 2014 photo, Yolanda Madrid of Miami, left, talks with navigator Daniela Campos, right, while signing up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, in Miami. Mirroring... (Associated Press) \n \n The site, CuidadoDeSalud.gov, launched more than two months late. \n \n A Web page with Spanish instructions linked users to an English form. \n \n And the translations were so clunky and full of grammatical mistakes that critics say they must have been computer-generated \u2014 the name of the site itself can literally be read \"for the caution of health.\" \n \n \"When you get into the details of the plans, it's not all written in Spanish. It's written in Spanglish, so we end up having to translate it for them,\" said Adrian Madriz, a health care navigator who helps with enrollment in Miami. \n \n The issues with the site underscore the halting efforts across the nation to get Spanish-speakers enrolled under the federal health care law. Critics say that as a result of various problems, including those related to the website, many people whom the law was designed to help have been left out of the first wave of coverage. \n \n Federal officials say they have been working to make the site better and plan further improvements soon. Also, administrators say they welcome feedback and try to fix typos or other errors quickly. \n \n \"We launched consumer-friendly Spanish online enrollment tools on CuidadoDeSalud.gov in December which represents one more way for Latinos to enroll in Marketplace plans,\" said Health and Human Services Department spokesman Richard Olague in an email to The Associated Press. \"Since the soft-launch, we continue to work closely with key stakeholders to get feedback in order to improve the experience for those consumers that use the website.\" \n \n Still, efforts to enroll Spanish-speakers have fallen short in several states with large Hispanic populations, and critics say the translated version of HealthCare.gov could have helped boost those numbers. \n \n In California, officials have acknowledged the need for improvements, saying fewer than 5,500 people signed up for health care in Spanish in October and November, the most recent period for which records are available. About 4.3 million California residents speak only Spanish, according to census data. It's not clear how many of these residents are without health insurance, but observers say few groups are more vulnerable. \n \n \"Spanish speakers are typically the ones who need to sign up for health insurance,\" said Veronica Plaza, a professor who teaches medical Spanish at the University of New Mexico. \"They are the ones who could use the support.\" \n \n In New Mexico, the state with the nation's highest percentage of Latino residents and where more than 20 percent of the state's population goes without health insurance, fewer than 1,000 people total signed up for coverage in October and November. \n \n In Florida, federal health officials have not said how many of the state's nearly 18,000 enrollees for October and November were Latino, but that group accounts for about one-third of the roughly 3.5 million uninsured people in the state. About 1.2 million people in the state speak only Spanish. \n \n Across the U.S., about 12 percent of the 317 million people in the country speak only Spanish, but federal officials have said less than 4 percent of calls to a national hotline were Spanish-only as of last month. \n \n Many blame at least some of the enrollment problems on the trouble-plagued site. \n \n \"In my opinion, the website doesn't work,\" said Grettl Diaz, a 37-year-old Miami gas station cashier who is originally from Cuba. \n \n Diaz said she tried to sign up at home using CuidadoDeSalud.gov. After she couldn't get the website to accept a scanned document, she called the government's Spanish hotline seeking help. However, she was repeatedly told to call back because the site was down. She got through days later and waited over an hour for an operator before she was ultimately disconnected. \n \n \"I'm very frustrated,\" she said through a translator this month. \"I've spent at least one week on the phone, and I couldn't get it done.\" \n \n Diaz, who speaks very little English, finally went to a counselor for help and is now waiting for an email from health officials saying she can proceed with her application. \n \n Diaz hasn't had insurance since moving to Florida two years ago. She will likely qualify for a tax subsidy to help pay her monthly premiums and has said she wants insurance mostly for peace of mind. \n \n \"Now, I am healthy,\" she said. \"But I don't know what will happen tomorrow.\" \n \n Such stories have frustrated Latino advocates, especially since the problems with the site come after an unprecedented collaboration between competing Spanish-language media outlets and Latino businesses, urging members of their communities to sign up for health care on Oct. 1. But advocates say despite promises from federal officials, the Spanish-language site was not up until Dec. 6. \n \n \"In many states, groups were cooperating and ready to go,\" said Patricia Perez, a partner of the VPE Public Relations, a Pasadena, Calif.-based firm that focuses on U.S. Latinos. \"It was a missed opportunity.\" \n \n Univision Communications Inc., which runs the largest Spanish-language media network, has been airing daily public service announcements about the health care overhaul. It hosted and aired a live town hall meeting out of Los Angeles last month to discuss the law, and another such event has been planned for February. \n \n The network frequently airs segments about the Affordable Care Act on its weekend health shows, and it produced a documentary exploring obstacles Latinos face signing up for health insurance, network spokesman Jose Zamora said. \n \n The film, featuring a 19-year-old Mexican-American whose father suffered three heart attacks with no insurance aired Dec. 1 \u2014 five days before CuidadoDeSalud.gov went live. \n \n Since the site has been active, users have reported disappointment and frustration in both the functionality and language. \n \n For example, links comparing insurance plans took users to the English version of the options. That glitch was fixed last week after The Associated Press contacted Health and Human Services to ask about the problem. \n \n As for the language, Plaza, the New Mexico professor, said a recent examination by her research students concluded that the translations were done \"by a computer-generated process\" and came across as awkward. \n \n \"There are problems with the verbs and word order that make sentences hard to understand,\" said Plaza, who helped develop an audio version to help residents in New Mexico sign up. \n \n \"Sometimes,\" she added, \"it's just the terms they use.\" \n \n The website translates \"premium\" into \"prima,\" but that Spanish word is more commonly used to mean a female cousin, Plaza said. A more accurate translation, she said, would be \"cuotas,\" ''couta mensual\" or \"costo annual.\" \n \n According to Health and Human Services, the website was translated with the same methods and team used to translate content into Spanish for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. \n \n But health care workers in Miami also have reported technical problems that don't exist on the English version of HealthCare.gov. \n \n Nini Hadwen, a health care navigator, said she also prefers to use the English website even when she's enrolling Spanish-language applicants. CuidadoDeSalud.gov \"doesn't navigate as smoothly from page to page,\" she said. \"It takes longer.\" \n \n Also, navigators say Spanish-language applicants must provide income and immigration documentation. Frequently, applicants are required to scan and fax supplemental documents, which can also be challenging, as Diaz's case shows. \n \n However, Jane Delgado, president and CEO of the National Alliance for Hispanic Health in Washington, D.C., defends the site, saying Friday that delays were merely \"part of the process\" and that she was confident federal officials would get it running better soon. \n \n \"Insurance is way complicated. It's not like paying for a cellphone,\" she said. \"Technology is only part of the answer.\" \n \n Overall, Delgado said Spanish-speaking Latinos will benefit from the federal overhaul in the long-term because the population is less likely to be insured compared with other groups. \n \n Still, Gabriel Sanchez, a political science professor at the University of New Mexico, said the problems hurt the credibility of federal officials and reinforce the belief held by some that authorities are indifferent to the plight of Latinos. \n \n Sanchez said, \"They will look at this, and think, 'Man, they really don't care about us.'\" \n \n ___ \n \n Kennedy and Associated Press writer Laura Wides-Munoz contributed to this report from Miami. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Russell Contreras at http://twitter.com/russcontreras . ||||| Health care Many Spanish speakers left behind in first wave of Obamacare Dec. 26, 2013 at 2:18 PM ET \n \n In Silicon Valley, the executives and engineers who\u2019ve helped build the Apple, Google and Facebook empires earn high salaries and enjoy a slew of perks, including stellar health benefits. \n \n The clients of the Ravenswood Family Health Center, a community clinic in East Palo Alto just two miles away from Facebook\u2019s sprawling headquarters, live in a very different Silicon Valley. \n \n They\u2019re the gardeners, nannies, factory workers and service staff who keep Silicon Valley homes and offices humming, the lawns manicured and the families comfortable. \n \n They are also, in many ways, a microcosm of the population the Affordable Care Act was meant to help. \n \n Many earn between $5 and $15 an hour, don\u2019t own or use computers and are more comfortable speaking Spanish than English. Sixty-five percent of East Palo Alto\u2019s population is Latino, a group seen as crucial to the success of the health law. Many lack health insurance and pose a lower financial risk because they are typically younger and healthier than others. \n \n Kaiser Health News \n \n Yet California, with the greatest number of Latinos in the country, is far behind in reaching this population. And across the nation, the picture appears even worse. \n \n Those who primarily speak Spanish are largely being left out of the first wave of coverage under Obamacare. Many missed this week\u2019s deadline for enrollment in plans beginning Jan. 1. People who want to be covered for any part of 2014 must sign up by March 31. \n \n In part, the lag in sign-ups among Spanish speakers reflects a digital \u2212 and a cultural \u2212 divide. Many are hesitant about handing over personal information to strangers over the Internet, advocates say. This group tends to be less educated, and have lower incomes and less access to technology than fluent English-speakers. \n \n When Elizabeth Gonzalez, 31, started getting migraines her doctor prescribed medicine that cost $300. She had health insurance provided through a San Mateo County program for low-income adults, but the medicine wasn\u2019t covered and she couldn\u2019t afford it. \n \n \u201cI guess I don\u2019t need it,\u201d she remembers thinking. Then she started wondering whether the new health law might offer a better plan. \n \n Gonzalez, a part-time library aide, started hunting for resources to help her decipher the Affordable Care Act. Though a Los Angeles native, she was raised in Morelia, Mexico and preferred to have the law explained to her in Spanish. \n \n California\u2019s health insurance marketplace, Covered California, has had a functioning Spanish-language website since Oct. 1 \u2013 which puts it ahead of most of the rest of the country. But Gonzalez couldn\u2019t access the site from home because she doesn\u2019t have Internet service or a smartphone. \n \n \u201cWith my budget, I don\u2019t have access to that,\u201d she said in Spanish. \u201cI have to limit myself to the primordial.\u201d \n \n Instead, she relied on staff at the county\u2019s human services office, two floors up from the library where she works, to guide her. \n \n Staff members there told her she needed to fill out an application and to wait for up to a month to hear whether she was eligible for Medi-Cal \u2212 California\u2019s insurance program for the poor. Discouraged, she made repeated telephone calls to the hotline for Covered California. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s no one picking up, probably because there\u2019s not enough people,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need more information in poor communities and places to help you fill out forms so you know you\u2019re doing it correctly. There\u2019s not enough [information] in Spanish.\u201d \n \n According to the latest data released by the state, less than 5 percent of California\u2019s roughly 110,000 signups in October and November were completed in Spanish. \n \n Statewide, Spanish-speaking operators at Covered California call centers, as well as navigators who can walk people through enrollment, are in short supply. The section on the Spanish version of Covered California for requesting help with enrollment still links to an English website. \n \n In other parts of the country, Spanish speakers are worse off. \n \n In the 36 states that rely on the federally run insurance exchanges, including Texas and Florida, Latinos until recently couldn\u2019t enroll online in Spanish. CuidadoDeSalud.gov \u2212 the Spanish-friendly version of the federal marketplace \u2212 wasn\u2019t fully working until Dec. 6, more than two months after its English counterpart, HealthCare.gov, launched on Oct. 1. \n \n Officials decided to hold off opening enrollment on CuidadoDeSalud.gov until they addressed the technical glitches plaguing the English version. Even now, the Spanish website is rife with grammatical errors. \n \n Federal officials note they have bilingual call centers, but Spanish-only calls to the federal exchange\u2019s call centers barely totaled 180,000, or the equivalent of 3.5 percent of all calls, as of Dec. 10. \n \n Unlike English speakers, Latinos who speak Spanish still don\u2019t have the option to window-shop for plans before creating an account. The section in which customers can consult plans before signing up with a username and password is still non-existent in Spanish. \n \n With many Latinos missing the deadline to be enrolled for coverage in the new marketplaces on Jan. 1, community organizers have shifted their attention to March 31, when the enrollment period for 2014 officially closes. Consumers who don\u2019t enroll by this date will face a penalty. Medi-Cal enrollment will remain open, however. \n \n \u201cMost of our community is going to be focused on that March 31 deadline, and that\u2019s where the big push will be,\u201d Jane Delgado, the president and CEO of the National Alliance for Hispanic Health, an advocacy group based in Washington D.C., said earlier this month. \u201cI\u2019m less concerned about getting everybody enrolled quickly than about getting people enrolled in plans that fit their needs. I have no doubt people will enroll. They just need better information and local navigators they can trust.\u201d \n \n Adding to their worries, Latinos living in households with undocumented relatives often fear that signing up for a government run program will lead to unwanted scrutiny and even deportations. Others are wary of getting cheated or having their personal information hacked online. \n \n Mindful of the mistrust, Ravenswood has been careful to develop a bond with its patients. \n \n The clinic has eight certified enrollment counselors to help clients determine what kind of insurance they need and can afford. \n \n \u201cThe majority of people coming in are people who we have to help 100 percent. We\u2019re both translating and explaining everything, even when they do speak English,\u201d said Ravenswood CEO Luisa Buada. \u201cIn general, everyone really, really wants someone to hold their hand through the whole process.\u201d \n \n Maria Garcia, 51, is among the roughly 200 people Ravenswood has screened or enrolled since October 1. Garcia, whose husband supports the family with his manufacturing job, went for help in part because she was concerned about fraud. \n \n \u201cLatinos \u2212 we don\u2019t trust easily,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wanted to be sure this wasn\u2019t a scam.\u201d \n \n Garcia doesn\u2019t speak English and though she has a computer at home, \u201cI haven\u2019t learned to use it,\u201d she said. She generally relies on her children to search the Web for her and to translate the information she needs. \n \n This time, the staff at Ravenswood helped her. Starting in January, she\u2019ll be paying $36 a month for coverage for her and her husband thanks to a government subsidy. \n \n After her discouraging experiences with the county office and the various hotlines, Gonzalez ended up at Ravenswood as well. It was just across the street from the library. Staffers quickly told her she qualified for Medi-Cal. Her migraine medication will now be covered. \n \n \u201cI was happy,\u201d she said. \n \n Ravenswood\u2019s counselors are booked solid through the end of January. Buada and her staff have set up six enclosed booths, each with a small table, a chair, a Lenovo computer and a wrap-around black-and-white curtain, so that people who don\u2019t have a computer or Internet access at home can feel comfortable coming in. \n \n \u201cWe are very good with cellphones or email, but to use that website, you actually have to have access to a computer. That\u2019s a problem,\u201d said the National Alliance for Hispanic Health\u2019s Jane Delgado. \n \n Even with the possibility of federal subsidies, some Latinos can\u2019t afford coverage and will remain uninsured. \n \n The median income for an East Palo Alto household is roughly $50,000, compared to a median income in the county of nearly $90,000. (On average, East Palo Alto households consist of four people compared to three countywide.) Often, 75 percent to 80 percent of a poor family\u2019s income is spent on housing. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of people come in interested,\u201d Buada says. But when they see how much it\u2019s going to cost, \u201cthey say, \u2018I can\u2019t pay for this,\u2019 and leave.\u201d \n \n Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.

The discovery indicates that life may have begun shortly after the planet formed 4.54 billion years ago. \n \n The research is published today in the online early edition of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \n \n \u201cTwenty years ago, this would have been heretical; finding evidence of life 3.8 billion years ago was shocking,\u201d said Mark Harrison, co-author of the research and a professor of geochemistry at UCLA. \n \n Reed Hutchinson/UCLA. Mark Harrison at UCLA. \n \n \u201cLife on Earth may have started almost instantaneously,\u201d added Harrison, a member of the National Academy of Sciences. \u201cWith the right ingredients, life seems to form very quickly.\u201d \n \n The new research suggests that life existed prior to the massive bombardment of the inner solar system that formed the moon\u2019s large craters 3.9 billion years ago. \n \n \u201cIf all life on Earth died during this bombardment, which some scientists have argued, then life must have restarted quickly,\u201d said Patrick Boehnke, a co-author of the research and a graduate student in Harrison\u2019s laboratory. \n \n Scientists had long believed the Earth was dry and desolate during that time period. Harrison\u2019s research \u2014 including a 2008 study in Nature he co-authored with Craig Manning, a professor of geology and geochemistry at UCLA, and former UCLA graduate student Michelle Hopkins \u2014 is proving otherwise. \n \n \u201cThe early Earth certainly wasn\u2019t a hellish, dry, boiling planet; we see absolutely no evidence for that,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cThe planet was probably much more like it is today than previously thought.\u201d \n \n The researchers, led by Elizabeth Bell \u2014 a postdoctoral scholar in Harrison\u2019s laboratory \u2014 studied more than 10,000 zircons originally formed from molten rocks, or magmas, from Western Australia. Zircons are heavy, durable minerals related to the synthetic cubic zirconium used for imitation diamonds. They capture and preserve their immediate environment, meaning they can serve as time capsules. \n \n The scientists identified 656 zircons containing dark specks that could be revealing and closely analyzed 79 of them with Raman spectroscopy, a technique that shows the molecular and chemical structure of ancient microorganisms in three dimensions. \n \n Bell and Boehnke, who have pioneered chemical and mineralogical tests to determine the condition of ancient zircons, were searching for carbon, the key component for life. \n \n One of the 79 zircons contained graphite \u2014 pure carbon \u2014 in two locations. \n \n \u201cThe first time that the graphite ever got exposed in the last 4.1 billion years is when Beth Ann and Patrick made the measurements this year,\u201d Harrison said. \n \n How confident are they that their zircon represents 4.1 billion-year-old graphite? \n \n \u201cVery confident,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cThere is no better case of a primary inclusion in a mineral ever documented, and nobody has offered a plausible alternative explanation for graphite of non-biological origin into a zircon.\u201d \n \n The graphite is older than the zircon containing it, the researchers said. They know the zircon is 4.1 billion years old, based on its ratio of uranium to lead; they don\u2019t know how much older the graphite is. \n \n The research suggests life in the universe could be abundant, Harrison said. On Earth, simple life appears to have formed quickly, but it likely took many millions of years for very simple life to evolve the ability to photosynthesize. \n \n The carbon contained in the zircon has a characteristic signature \u2014 a specific ratio of carbon-12 to carbon-13 \u2014 that indicates the presence of photosynthetic life. \n \n \u201cWe need to think differently about the early Earth,\u201d Bell said. \n \n Wendy Mao, an associate professor of geological sciences and photon science at Stanford University, is the other co-author of the research. \n \n The research was funded by the National Science Foundation and a Simons Collaboration on the Origin of Life Postdoctoral Fellowship granted to Bell. ||||| Did life have hellish origins? Carbon with an organic-like signature has been discovered sealed within a crystal that formed during an interval of Earth\u2019s history named after Hades, the underworld of Greek mythology. The find predates other evidence of life by 300 million years. \n \n Our planet formed roughly 4.5 billion years ago, but it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess exactly when life first appeared. The oldest reliable fossils are about 3.43 billion years old. Chemical signatures in even older rocks suggest life might have been present 3.8 billion years ago. \n \n All of these early fossil signatures belong to the Archaean, which began 4 billion years ago. It is generally thought that conditions on Earth before then were so extreme that life wouldn\u2019t have stood a chance of survival \u2013 which is why the pre-Archaean stage of Earth\u2019s history has been dubbed the Hadean. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Signs of life \n \n But Elizabeth Bell and Mark Harrison at the University of California, Los Angeles, and their colleagues think life might have existed in the Hadean after all. \n \n They analysed more than 10,000 zircon crystals smaller than a millimetre in length that date from the Archaean and Hadean. In one Hadean crystal they found tiny flecks, or inclusions, of graphite, which must have been incorporated into the zircon crystal when it formed some 4.1 billion years ago. \n \n The researchers analysed the carbon isotopes in two of the graphite flecks, and found both graphite flecks had a high carbon-12 to carbon-13 isotope ratio, a characteristic feature of organic origins as life preferentially absorbs carbon-12. \n \n It\u2019s not the first time that people have claimed the discovery of potentially organic carbon in Hadean zircons \u2013 but the carbon in those earlier claims turned out to be an artefact of the preparation techniques used to study the zircons, says Harrison. \u201cI think there will be little dispute regarding the primary nature of the inclusions,\u201d he says. \n \n What will be up for discussion is whether the isotopic signature is evidence for the presence of life, says Bell. The general chemical make-up of the zircon crystals suggests that the magma they cooled from was generated by the melting of a mud-rich sediment, which is the sort of environment in which organic remains might accumulate. \n \n Lifeless reactions \n \n But the team points out there are also inorganic ways that isotopically light carbon could have accumulated in Hadean environments, for instance, through some of the Fischer-Tropsch chemical reactions that can turn carbon monoxide and hydrogen into liquid hydrocarbons. \n \n Ultimately, carbon isotope data on its own is too ambiguous to decide whether Hadean carbon is evidence of Hadean life, says Thomas McCollom at the University of Colorado, Boulder. \u201cI know a lot of people want to use such data as evidence of life, but this is governed more by what they want the outcome to be rather than scientific principles,\u201d he says. \n \n It\u2019s always going to be tough to convince everyone to accept that Hadean zircons carry proof of life. \u201cProof is a realm better suited to mathematics than the natural sciences,\u201d says Steve Mojzsis also at the University of Colorado, Boulder. \n \n Even so, he thinks the new study is important. \u201cHarrison and his team have challenged us now to think deeply about just how ancient the biosphere could be and to find new ways to explore for a cryptic record of it.\u201d \n \n Journal reference: PNAS, DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1517557112 \n \n Read more: \u201cFirst life: The search for the first replicator\u201d \n \n Image credit: Richard Bizley/SPL \n \n Correction: This article has been updated to clarify that it is the ratio of different carbon isotopes, not just the presence of those isotopes, that is characteristic of organic origin.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Life of one kind or another has been around on this planet for 300 million years longer than thought, according to US researchers who took a close look at some incredibly ancient crystals unearthed in Australia. The scientists say that the zircon crystals from 4.1 billion years ago contain a telltale carbon deposit that appears to have come from something organic, Reuters reports. That's getting closer to the origin of the planet itself, roughly 4.5 billion years ago. Before now, the earliest hint of life was found in rocks 3.8 billion years old. There's no chance the carbon deposit could be any younger than the zircon because the crystal is crack-free and undisturbed, the researchers write in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The zircon crystals were formed during a geological era known as the Hadean, after Hades, because conditions were thought to be so hellish that no life could have existed, the New Scientist notes. The UCLA and Stanford researchers now dispute that, saying life on Earth may have formed \"almost instantaneously\"\u2014and restarted quickly if it were wiped out at some point. \"The early Earth certainly wasn't a hellish, dry, boiling planet; we see absolutely no evidence for that,\" study co-author Mark Harrison says in a UCLA press release. \"The planet was probably much more like it is today than previously thought.\u201d (Earth's first big predator may have been an enormous sea scorpion.)",

    "document": "Amid a national shortage of a critical medicine, US hospitals are hoarding vials, delaying surgeries, and turning away patients, The New York Times reports. The medicine in short supply: solutions of sodium bicarbonate\u2014aka, baking soda. \n \n The simple drug is used in all sorts of treatments, from chemotherapies to those for organ failure. It can help correct the pH of blood and ease the pain of stitches. It is used in open-heart surgery, can help reverse poisonings, and is kept on emergency crash carts. But, however basic and life-saving, the drug has been in short supply since around February. \n \n The country\u2019s two suppliers, Pfizer and Amphastar, ran low following an issue with one of Pfizer\u2019s suppliers\u2014the issue was undisclosed due to confidentiality agreements. Amphastar\u2019s supplies took a hit with a spike in demand from desperate Pfizer customers. Both companies told the NYT that they don\u2019t know when exactly supplies will be restored. They speculate that it will be no earlier than June or August. \n \n As hospitals and pharmacists struggle with the sodium bicarbonate shortage, experts note that it\u2019s just the latest example of stocks of inexpensive, essential generic medicines hitting alarming lows. For example, there was a sodium bicarbonate scarcity in 2012 and a similarly alarming shortage of saline solution in 2014. \n \n Further Reading Dangerous shortage of essential antibiotics is all about $$ Experts blame the shortages on a combination of factors, including problems getting raw materials, issues with aging facilities where many old drugs are manufactured, and consolidation in the industry that reduces the number of potential suppliers. There\u2019s also the concern that because generic drugs are unlikely to drive profits, drug companies may not make necessary investments to maintain supplies. \n \n But when there isn\u2019t a steady supply, patients suffer. With the shortage of sodium bicarbonate, hospitals are postponing surgeries and chemotherapy treatments. A hospital in Mobile, Alabama, for example, postponed seven open-heart surgeries and sent one critically ill patient to another hospital due to the shortage. \n \n The Food and Drug Administration is working with Pfizer and Amphastar to try to mitigate the effects of the scarcity. A spokesperson for the agency said that it is \u201cexploring all possible solutions to this critical shortage, including temporary importation, to help with this shortage until it\u2019s resolved.\u201d \n \n In recent years, the agency has been addressing the problem of shortages and has made progress. In 2011, there were 251 shortages, while there were only 23 in 2016. There are currently 50 drugs listed in short supply. ||||| PEORIA \u2014 A national shortage of a common drug is prompting hospitals to conserve their supply for only the most necessary applications. \n \n While The New York Times has reported that a shortage of sodium bicarbonate has forced some hospitals to delay chemotherapy treatments and operations or send patients across town, both OSF HealthCare and UnityPoint Health-Peoria say that in light of the shortage, the hospitals have been conservative with their supplies without resorting to such drastic measures. \n \n \"Our supply has been trickling in, and we are maintaining critical operations,\" said Rhonda Georgieff, manager of pharmacy supply chain operations at OSF. \"We are just experiencing major delays and back orders, or order that may come in only partially filled.\" \n \n While sodium bicarbonate solution is a simple drug \u2014 sodium bicarbonate in its solid form is known as baking soda \u2014 its use in medicine is more complicated than restocking at the local grocery store. The solution, delivered via IV, must be sterile and of certain chemical composition. Only two suppliers in the United States offer the drug, and one is having production issues and the other isn't able to absorb the increased demand. \n \n While the drug is simple, it's also critical to some hospital operations. It's used to lower the pH of blood that has become too acidic, in emergency and operating rooms, as an antidote to certain poisons, with certain types of chemo and to reduce pain, the Times reported. \n \n But it's limited availability may be due in part to its affordability. Manufacturers don't bother with generic forms of cheap drugs like sodium bicarbonate, Georgeiff said. Combine reduced profit incentive for U.S. manufacturers with increased oversight of overseas manufacturers, and shortages are bound to happen. \n \n Sodium bicarbonate is just one of dozens of drugs listed in shortage by the FDA and American Society of Hospital Pharmacists. Hospitals and pharmacies are well practiced in conserving medications in short supply, often without any noticeable change in operations as far as patients can tell. \n \n \"We expect this situation to continue for another month. Hopefully, not longer,\" Georgieff said. \n \n Laura Nightengale is the Journal Star's health and lifestyle reporter. She can be reached at 686-3181 or lnightengale@pjstar.com.

But the nation's two lone suppliers, Pfizer and Amphastar, are suddenly unable to give medical facilities what they need, causing those facilities to hoard what's left in their own cabinets. \"Does the immediate need of a patient outweigh the expected need of a patient?\" says the head pharmacist at a hospital in Mobile, Ala., calling it a \"medical and ethical question that goes beyond anything I've had to experience before.\" Supply problems can arise when things go wrong at the factory level or when suppliers of the raw ingredients have issues, leaving hospital officials irritated at the short notice they receive about a dearth. Right now on the FDA website, there are dozens of drugs said to be \"currently in shortage,\" many of them critical generic injectables. Some pharmacy officials even harbor suspicions that manufacturers aren't investing enough to ensure adequate supplies since, per Ars Technica, generic drugs aren't the moneymakers. Some hospitals have \"compounding pharmacies\" where they whip up their own generic drugs, but that doesn't solve the larger problem. \"It is unbelievably frustrating,\" a University of Utah drug shortage expert tells the Times, which notes Pfizer and Amphastar can't guarantee more sodium bicarbonate supplies until at least June and maybe not until August in some cases.

    "document": "In the long history of false promises made by trade negotiators, the claim that China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001 would reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China and create good U.S. jobs stands out. The total U.S. goods trade deficit with China reached $324.2 billion in 2013. Between 2001 and 2013, this growing deficit eliminated or displaced 3.2 million U.S. jobs (Kimball and Scott 2014). As the world\u2019s largest retailer, U.S.-based Wal-Mart is a key conduit of Chinese imports into the American market. This paper updates earlier work (Scott 2007) to provide a conservative estimate of how many jobs have likely been displaced by Chinese imports entering the country through Wal-Mart: \n \n Chinese imports entering through Wal-Mart in 2013 likely totaled at least $49.1 billion and the combined effect of imports from and exports to China conducted through Wal-Mart likely accounted for 15.3 percent of the growth of the total U.S. goods trade deficit with China between 2001 and 2013. \n \n The Wal-Mart-based trade deficit with China alone eliminated or displaced over 400,000 U.S. jobs between 2001 and 2013. \n \n The manufacturing sector and its workers have been hardest hit by the growth of Wal-Mart\u2019s imports. Wal-Mart\u2019s increased trade deficit with China between 2001 and 2013 eliminated 314,500 manufacturing jobs, 75.7 percent of the jobs lost from Wal-Mart\u2019s trade deficit. These job losses are particularly destructive because jobs in the manufacturing sector pay higher wages and provide better benefits than most other industries, especially for workers with less than a college education. \n \n Wal-Mart has announced plans to create opportunities for American manufacturing by \u201cinvesting in American jobs.\ufffd? To date, very few actual U.S. jobs have been created by this program, and since 2001, the growing Wal-Mart trade deficit with China has displaced more than 100 U.S. jobs for every actual or promised job created through this program. \n \n China has achieved its rapidly growing trade surpluses by manipulating its currency: it invests hundreds of billions of dollars per year in U.S. Treasury bills, other government securities, and private foreign assets to bid up the value of the dollar and other currencies and thereby lower the cost of its exports to the United States and other countries. China has also repressed the labor rights of its workers and suppressed their wages, making its products artificially cheap and further subsidizing its exports. Wal-Mart has aided China\u2019s abuse of labor rights and its violations of internationally recognized norms of fair trade by providing a vast and ever-expanding conduit for the distribution of artificially cheap and subsidized Chinese exports to the United States. \n \n China trade and U.S. job loss \n \n Exports support jobs in the United States, and imports displace them. Thus, the net effect of trade flows on employment must be based on an analysis of the trade balance. This Briefing Paper calculates the employment effects of growing goods trade deficits by using an input-output model that estimates the direct and indirect labor requirements of producing output in a given domestic industry. The model includes 195 U.S. industries, 77 of which are in the manufacturing sector. \n \n The model estimates the labor that would be required to produce a given volume of exports, and the labor that is displaced when a given volume of imports is substituted for domestic output. The job losses presented here represent an estimate of what total employment levels would have been in the absence of growing trade deficits. \n \n U.S. exports to China in 2001 supported 161,400 jobs, but U.S. imports displaced production that would have supported 1,127,700 jobs, as shown in the bottom half of Table 1. Therefore, the $84.1 billion goods trade deficit in 2001 displaced nearly 1 million jobs in that year. Net job displacement rose to 4,123,400 in 2013. Growth in trade deficits with China has reduced demand for goods produced in every region of the United States and has led to job displacement in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The overall China trade and job loss estimates in this report are based on the findings reported in Kimball and Scott (2014). \n \n Table 1 Wal-Mart \u2013 China goods trade and U.S. job displacement, 2001\u20132013 2001 2013 Change, 2001\u20132013 U.S. total Wal-Mart U.S. total Wal-Mart U.S. total Wal-Mart Goods trade with China ($ billions, nominal) U.S. domestic exports* 18.0 0.1 114.0 1.0 96.0 0.9 U.S. imports for consumption 102.1 11.4 438.2 49.1 336.1 37.6 U.S. trade balance -84.1 -11.4 -324.2 -48.1 -240.1 -36.7 Wal-Mart share of U.S. imports 11.2% U.S. trade-related jobs supported and displaced (thousands of jobs) U.S. domestic exports\u2013jobs supported 161.4 0.5 767.5 6.5 606.1 6.1 U.S. imports for consumption\u2013jobs displaced 1,127.7 126.3 4,890.9 547.8 3,763.2 421.5 U.S. trade balance\u2013net jobs displaced 966.3 125.8 4,123.4 541.3 3,157.1 415.4 Wal-Mart share of U.S. Job loss 13.2% *Domestic exports are goods produced in the United States and exclude foreign exports (re-exports), i.e., goods produced in other countries and shipped through the United States.

Download image \n \n Wal-Mart\u2019s role \n \n Given its enormous size and the fact that it sells manufactured goods, which have been the primary Chinese export to the U.S. in recent years, it is natural to try to estimate the role of Wal-Mart as a conduit for Chinese trade. We find that a conservative estimate is that Wal-Mart accounted for approximately 11.2 percent of total U.S. goods imports from China between 2001 and 2013. This estimate is based on published reports on Wal-Mart trade with China between 2001 and 2004, including Wal-Mart\u2019s own estimates of its imports from China, on more recent published data on ocean trade (by company), and on the relationship between total Wal-Mart sales in the United States and personal consumption expenditures on goods from the GDP accounts (BEA 2015). \n \n Wal-Mart provided its own estimate for the value of imports from China in its fiscal year ending January 31, 2004 (Wal-Mart 2007). Most of these goods were imported in 2003, and the Wal-Mart share of total imports from China in that year was 11.9 percent. Bianco and Zellner (2003) and Bianco (2006) have also attempted to construct estimates of Wal-Mart\u2019s imports from China and have reported imports that yield shares that are similar to Wal-Mart\u2019s own estimates, with the lowest share reported as 11.2 percent in 2004. Since 2007, evidence strongly suggests that this share has not shrunk (and may have risen). For example, The Journal of Commerce produces annual reports of total U.S. imports and exports of goods via ocean container transport. While this is a partial and incomplete accounting, it does show that Wal-Mart was the top U.S. importer of ocean container freight in every year between 2001 and 2013, and its share of top 100 imports remained stable in a range from 12.1 percent to 14.8 percent of total imports of the top 100 importers. \n \n Limited data on total imports by company are also available from shipments data collected by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency. Data on Wal-Mart imports are available for only two comparable months in the study period: November 2007 and 2012. The available information reports total imports in both kilograms and container equivalents (twenty-foot equivalent units or TEUs). The Wal-Mart share of total imports from China increased in both kilograms and TEUs in this period (Panjiva.com 2015). In short, the 2003 share of imports accounted for by Wal-Mart as estimated by the company itself (11.2 percent) has likely only grown since then. However, for this report we make the conservative assumption that it has remained stable. \n \n But a stable share of Wal-Mart imports implies rapid growth in volumes. U.S. goods imports from China increased $336.1 billion between 2001 and 2013, as shown in the top half of Table 1, an increase of 329 percent. If Wal-Mart\u2019s share of U.S. imports from China remained stable in this period at 11.2 percent, this implies that its imports increased from $11.4 billion in 2001 to $49.1 billion in 2013, an increase of $37.6 billion. As it is a retailer and not a manufacturer, Wal-Mart likely exports only a negligible amount to China. Our best estimate is that Wal-Mart accounts (at most) for roughly 1.0 percent of total U.S. exports to China. This in turn implies that Wal-Mart was responsible for a $36.7 billion increase in the U.S. trade deficit with China between 2001 and 2013. \n \n The Wal-Mart trade deficit displaced 125,800 jobs in 2001 and 541,300 jobs in 2013. Thus, Wal-Mart was responsible for displacing at least an additional 415,400 U.S. jobs between 2001 and 2013, as shown in the bottom half of Table 1 and in Figure A. While Wal-Mart was responsible for 11.2 percent of U.S. imports in this period, it was responsible for 13.2 percent of the U.S. job losses due to growing trade deficits with China (Table 1). Since Wal-Mart\u2019s exports to China were negligible, the rapid growth of its imports had a proportionately bigger impact on the U.S. trade deficit and job losses than overall U.S. trade flows with China (since the rest of U.S. trade with China does include significant U.S. exports to that country). On average, each of the 4,835 stores Wal-Mart operated in the United States in fiscal 2014 (Wal-Mart Stores Inc. 2014) was responsible for the loss of about 86 U.S. jobs due to the growth of Wal-Mart\u2019s trade deficit with China between 2001 and 2013. \n \n Figure A Wal-Mart share of jobs lost due to growth of U.S. goods trade deficit with China, 2001\u20132013 Category Jobs Other U.S. trade 2,741,700 Wal-Mart 415,400 Chart Data Download data The data below can be saved or copied directly into Excel.

These are particularly labor-intensive manufacturing industries and support more jobs per $1 billion of imports than more capital-intensive goods such as machine tools, motor vehicles and parts, and aircraft and parts imported by other U.S. firms. \n \n Job losses in manufacturing account for 75.7 percent of total jobs displaced due to the growing U.S. trade deficit with China in this period (Kimball and Scott 2014, Table 3). Jobs in the manufacturing sector pay higher wages and provide better benefits than most other industries, especially for workers with less than a college education. Manufacturing also employs a greater share of such workers than other sectors (Scott 2013). \n \n The job displacement estimates in this study are conservative. They include only the jobs directly or indirectly displaced by trade, and exclude jobs in domestic wholesale and retail trade or advertising; they also exclude re-spending employment. They also do not account for the fact that during the Great Recession of 2007\u20132009, and continuing through 2013, jobs displaced by China trade reduced wages and spending, which led to further job losses. \n \n Further, the labor-market effects of the U.S. trade deficit with China are not limited to job loss and displacement and the associated direct wage losses. Competition with low-wage workers from less-developed countries such as China has driven down wages for workers in U.S. manufacturing and reduced the wages and bargaining power of similar, non-college-educated workers throughout the economy, as previous EPI research has shown (Bivens 2013). The affected population includes essentially all workers with less than a four-year college degree\u2014such workers make up roughly 70 percent of the workforce, or about 100 million workers (U.S. Census Bureau 2015). \n \n The workers affected by this job displacement include millions whose jobs were not lost but whose wages were held down because of increased labor market competition with the job losers. As earlier EPI research has shown, trade with China between 2001 and 2011 displaced 2.7 million workers, who suffered a direct loss of $37.0 billion in reduced wages alone when re-employed in non-traded industries in 2011 (Scott 2013). In addition, the nation\u2019s 100 million non-college educated workers suffered a total loss of roughly $180 billion due to increased trade with low-wage countries. These indirect wage losses were nearly five times greater than the direct losses suffered by workers displaced by China trade, and the pool of affected workers was nearly 40 times larger (100 million non-college-educated workers versus 2.7 million displaced workers). \n \n Wal-Mart\u2019s U.S. manufacturing promises \n \n In 2013 Wal-Mart announced a plan to purchase \u201c$250 billion in products that support the creation of American jobs\ufffd? by 2023 by increasing purchases of U.S. manufactured goods (Loeb 2013, Wal-Mart 2015a). To date, very few actual U.S. manufacturing jobs have been created as a result of this commitment. Wal-Mart remains, by far, the top importer of ocean shipping containers in the United States with total imports of more than 775,000 container-equivalents (TEUs) in 2014, exceeding total imports by Target, the number two importer, by more than 250,000 TEUs (48.7 percent, more than total Target imports) (Journal of Commerce 2015). In addition, about two-thirds of what Wal-Mart calls American-made goods are actually groceries, which support few U.S. manufacturing jobs (Alliance for American Manufacturing 2015). \n \n In 2015, Wal-Mart\u2019s publicly available list of manufacturing jobs that have been or will be created in the United States includes fewer than 4,100 specific U.S. manufacturing jobs, and many of those are promised jobs that firms \u201cwill create\ufffd? up to 10 years in the future (Wal-Mart 2015c). Since 2001, Wal-Mart\u2019s growing trade deficit with China has displaced more than 100 U.S. jobs for every job that Wal-Mart has created in the United States through its \u201cInvest in American Jobs\ufffd? program.\ufffd? Meanwhile, the U.S. goods trade deficit with China increased by $23.9 billion (7.5 percent) in 2014 (Scott 2015). Continuing growth in that trade deficit and in Wal-Mart imports will likely displace many times more manufacturing jobs than Wal-Mart creates in the United States over the next decade. \n \n Conclusion \n \n The growing goods trade deficit with China displaced 3.2 million U.S. jobs in the United States between 2001 and 2013, and it has been a prime contributor to the crisis in manufacturing employment over the past 15 years. Due to its own growing trade deficit with China, Wal-Mart alone was responsible for the loss of more than 400,000 U.S. jobs, 13.2 percent of total U.S. jobs lost in this period. The current unbalanced U.S.-China trade relationship is bad for both countries, and Wal-Mart has played a major role in creating that imbalance. The United States is piling up foreign debt, losing export capacity, and facing a more fragile macroeconomic environment. \n \n Meanwhile, China has become dependent on the U.S. consumer market for employment generation, has suppressed the purchasing power of its own middle class with a weak currency, and, most importantly, has purchased trillions of dollars of hard-currency reserves in low-yielding, government securities and other financial assets, instead of investing these funds in public goods that could benefit Chinese consumers and workers. In order to artificially and illegally hold down the value of its currency, and thereby lower the cost of its exports to the United States and other countries, China has purchased nearly $5 trillion in U.S. Treasury bills and other government securities and private assets (IMF 2015, SWFI 2015) since it entered the WTO in 2001. It has also repressed the labor rights and wages of its workers, making its exports artificially cheap, further subsidizing its exports. Wal-Mart has aided China\u2019s abuse of labor rights and its violations of internationally recognized norms of fair trade behavior by providing a vast and growing conduit for the distribution of artificially cheap and subsidized Chinese exports to the United States. \n \n The U.S. relationship with China needs fundamental change: addressing the exchange rate policies and labor standards issues in the Chinese economy should be important national priorities. Wal-Mart\u2019s huge reliance on Chinese imports illustrates that many powerful economic actors in the United States benefit from China\u2019s unfair trading system. Wal-Mart\u2019s gain, however, is not the country\u2019s gain, as Wal-Mart\u2019s imports have contributed to the ever-growing trade deficit that imperils future economic growth. \n \n \u2014The author thanks Josh Bivens and Ross Eisenbrey for comments; Elizabeth Glass for research assistance; and Molly McGrath, Kevin Rudiger, and Aditya Pande for data analysis. \n \n About the author \n \n Robert E.

Re-exports do not support domestic employment because they are not produced domestically and they are excluded from the model used here. See Table 1 for information about the levels of U.S. re-exports to China in this period. \n \n This model assumes that everything else is held constant; the trade and job loss estimates shown here are based on counterfactual simulations. \n \n The complete list of Journal of Commerce citations for 2004\u20132015, covering calendar year trade between 2003 and 2014, is available on request. \n \n Wal-Mart (2007) reports that it \u201cestimates about $18 billion worth of products were purchased from China [in the fiscal year ending 2004] \u2026 about $9 billion imported from direct sources and about $9 billion from indirect.\ufffd? These data are for Wal-Mart\u2019s fiscal year ending on January 31, 2004, and were 11.9 percent of U.S. consumption imports from China in 2003, when most of those goods were imported. The following estimates all assume that Chinese imports are for Wal-Mart fiscal years (FY), and are compared with total U.S. imports in the preceding calendar years. Bianco and Zellner (2003) report that Wal-Mart imports from China totaled $12 billion (11.8 percent of U.S.-China imports) in FY 2002. Bianco (2006) reports that Wal-Mart imports from China were $22 billion in FY2005 (11.2 percent of China imports). Bianco\u2019s estimates for FY 2004 replicate the estimate provided by Wal-Mart (2007) for its FY2004 imports from China. Based on these estimates, Table 1 assumes, conservatively, that Wal-Mart maintained a stable 11.2 percent share of U.S. goods imports from China between 2001 and 2013. \n \n Between 2003 and 2013, overall Wal-Mart net sales in the United States rose from $208.8 billion to $336.6 billion (Wal-Mart Stores Inc. various years), rising from 7.7 percent of total U.S. personal consumption expenditures on goods in 2003 to 8.8 percent in 2013 (BEA 2015). Thus, Wal-Mart was a major and growing channel for the distribution of both domestic and imported goods in the United States in this period. Wal-Mart was also the single largest U.S. importer of goods imported from all countries via ocean container freight in 2014 (Journal of Commerce 2015), and was responsible for 12.1 percent of the total containers imported by the top 100 companies in that year. These data suggest that Wal-Mart\u2019s share of total China imports likely increased between 2003 and 2013. Thus, the estimate of jobs displaced by Wal-Mart\u2019s China trade in Table 1 likely represent a lower-bound estimate of actual jobs displaced. \n \n Under U.S. rules, companies are allowed to petition Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to avoid disclosure of company names on bills of lading that accompany each shipment. Periodically, gaps appear in these disclosure petitions, making importing companies known for short periods of time. Comparable Wal-Mart data are available only for November 2007 and 2012 from this database. \n \n This calculation is based on the ratio of total Wal-Mart international sales per square foot times an estimate of total Wal-Mart square footage in China, in various Wal-Mart fiscal years (Wal-Mart Stores Inc. 2002, 2006, 2014). Wal-Mart reports state that \u201cover 95 percent of the merchandise in our stores in China is sourced locally\ufffd? (Wal-Mart 2015b). Export estimates in this paper assume that sales per store in China were equal to the average per square foot for all Wal-Mart international stores times estimated total Wal-Mart square footage in China, and that all Wal-Mart imports into China came from the United States (the average Wal-Mart store in China was 2.3 to 2.8 times larger than the average Wal-Mart international store, based on data reported by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (various years)). This is clearly an upper bound on total Wal-Mart exports to China because it assumes that all Wal-Mart imports into China originated in the United States, which is highly unlikely. \n \n Wal-Mart had 6,107 international stores at the end of FY2014 and total international sales of $136.5 billion in 2014, or about $22.3 million per store. Wal-Mart had 405 stores in China, with estimated total sales of $25.6 billion in FY2014, and total imports of $1.0 billion (reported as U.S. exports in 2013 in Table 1). Assuming that all these imports were shipped from the United States, Wal-Mart was responsible for 0.9 percent of total U.S. exports to China in 2013. \n \n These estimates assume that jobs supported and displaced by Wal-Mart\u2019s China trade were directly proportional to total jobs supported and displaced by total U.S. exports to and imports from China in 2001 and 2013, as estimated by Kimball and Scott (2014). \n \n Direct jobs displaced refer to jobs displaced within a given industry, such as motor vehicles and parts. Indirect jobs displaced are those displaced in industries that supply inputs to that industry, such as primary metal (e.g., steel), plastics and rubber products (e.g., tires and hoses), transportation, and information. Re-spending employment results from the spending of wages by employed workers. It is one form of a macroeconomic multiplier. \n \n Author\u2019s calculations from the estimated $1,800 wages lost by a median-wage non-college educated worker per year (Bivens 2013) times the 68.1 percent of the workforce made up of workers with less than a four-year college degree (U.S. Census Bureau 2015) times total number of U.S. workers employed (on average) in 2014 from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS 2015) (yielding roughly 100 million non-college educated workers). \n \n The initial Wal-Mart commitment was to purchase $50 billion in \u201cU.S. products,\ufffd? a figure that was subsequently increased to $250 billion (Loeb 2013, Walmart 2015a). \n \n References \n \n Alliance for American Manufacturing. 2015. \u201cANOTHER Walmart Made in America Infographic Needed Some Work, So We Fixed It.\ufffd?

As the world's largest retailer, it seems to follow that U.S.-based Walmart would be a key contributor to the climbing deficit and subsequent job losses. The EPI estimates that the retailer's Chinese imports account for 15.3% of trade deficit growth in that time period. \n \n The study states that, in total, the U.S. trade deficit resulted in a net job loss of nearly 1 million in 2001; that number rose to over 4 million by 2013. It estimates Walmart alone contributed to over 400,000 job losses over those 12 years, and speculates that about 75% of those were manufacturing jobs which offer better pay and benefits than other affected industries, particularly for workers who lack a college education. \n \n Walmart announced in 2013 its plans to increase sourcing of U.S.-made products by $50 billion in the following 10 years, the New York Times reports . The EPI's study denounces that program claiming that 100 jobs are displaced by the company for every one job created. \n \n The EPI utilized information from a 2007 report to construct these estimates and, since the breakdown of a company's imports aren't publicly released, it relied on guesswork. A spokesperson for the company criticized the study: \n \n We are very proud of our U.S. manufacturing initiative and the results speak for themselves. By investing in products that support American jobs, we are able to bring new products to our shelves while bringing new jobs to local communities in Ohio, Tennessee, California, and many others. Unfortunately, this is an old report with flawed economic analysis that assumed that imports equal job losses and does not take into consideration that countless jobs are added through the global supply chain, distribution and logistics, among other areas of business. \n \n The EPI is headed by chairman Richard L. Trumka who also serves as the president of AFL-CIO, the largest federation of unions in the U.S.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 America's favorite big-box retailer may be responsible for the loss of hundreds of thousands of US jobs since 2001, Fortune reports. According to a new study from the Economic Policy Institute, Walmart's importing of cheap Chinese goods resulted in the elimination of 400,000 American jobs between 2001 and 2013 by increasing the US' trade deficit with China. It's an estimate the EPI calls \"conservative.\" About three-quarters of those lost jobs were likely manufacturing jobs, Fortune reports. \"These job losses are particularly destructive because jobs in the manufacturing sector pay higher wages and provide better benefits than most other industries, especially for workers with less than a college education,\" the study states. The EPI estimates Walmart is responsible for more than 15% of the trade deficit growth from 2001 to 2013, costing 3.2 million US jobs. Fortune reports the EPI's study is based on a 2007 report and\u2014because Walmart doesn't release specifics on its imports\u2014\"guesswork.\" Needless to say, Walmart disagrees with the EPI's findings. \"Unfortunately, this is an old report with flawed economic analysis that assumed that imports equal job losses and does not take into consideration that countless jobs are added,\" Fortune quotes a Walmart statement. Economists agree, pointing to retail and transportation jobs created by importing goods, according to the New York Times. In 2013, Walmart announced it would increase its use of American-made goods by $50 billion over the next decade. But the EPI counters that Walmart's importing of Chinese goods has cost 100 US jobs for every one American job it creates with that program.",

A fuselage rupture and a sudden drop... (Associated Press) \n \n Aboard Southwest Flight 812, Shawna Malvini Redden covered her ears, then felt a brisk wind rush by. Oxygen masks fell, the cabin lost pressure, and Redden, now suddenly lightheaded, fumbled to maneuver the mask in place. \n \n Then she prayed. And, instinctively, reached out to the stranger seated next to her in Row 8 as the pilot of the damaged aircraft began a rapid descent from about 34,400 feet in the sky. \n \n \"I don't know this dude, but I was like, 'I'm going to just hold your hand,'\" Redden, a 28-year-old doctoral student at Arizona State University, recalled Saturday, a day after her Phoenix-to-Sacramento flight was forced into an emergency landing at a military base in Yuma, Ariz., with a hole a few feet long in the roof of the passenger cabin. \n \n No serious injuries were reported among the 118 people aboard, according to Southwest officials. \n \n What caused part of the fuselage to rupture on the 15-year-old Boeing 737-300 was a mystery, and investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board arrived Saturday in Yuma to begin an inquiry. \n \n NTSB board member Robert Sumwalt said investigators were going to cut a piece out of the fuselage, which would be studied for fracture patterns. He said they would also examine the plane's black box and flight recorders, which arrived Saturday at NTSB headquarters in Washington, D.C. \n \n Southwest, meanwhile, grounded about 80 similar planes so that they could be inspected, and said that as a result some 300 flights were being canceled Saturday. Airline spokeswoman Linda Rutherford said it was too soon to estimate the cost of grounding a portion of its fleet. \n \n Southwest operates about 170 of the 737-300s in its fleet of about 540 planes, but it replaced the aluminum skin on many of the 300s in recent years, Rutherford said. The planes that were grounded Saturday have not had their skin replaced, she said. \n \n \"Obviously we're dealing with a skin issue, and we believe that these 80 airplanes are covered by a set of (federal safety rules) that make them candidates to do this additional inspection that Boeing is devising for us,\" Rutherford said. \n \n Julie O'Donnell, an aviation safety spokeswoman for Seattle-based Boeing Commercial Airplanes, confirmed \"a hole in the fuselage and a depressurization event\" in the latest incident but declined to speculate on what caused it. \n \n A total of 288 Boeing 737-300s currently operate in the U.S. fleet, and 931 operate worldwide, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. \"The FAA is working closely with the NTSB, Southwest Airlines and Boeing to determine what actions may be necessary,\" the FAA said Saturday. \n \n Southwest officials said the Arizona plane had undergone all inspections required by the FAA. They said the plane was given a routine inspection Tuesday and underwent its last so-called heavy check, a more costly and extensive overhaul, in March 2010. \n \n An Associated Press review of FAA records of maintenance problems for the plane show that in March 2010 at least eight instances were found of cracking in the aircraft frame, which is part of the fuselage. Those cracks were repaired, the records indicated. \n \n It's not uncommon for fuselage cracks to be found during inspections of planes that age, especially during scheduled heavy maintenance checks in which they are taken apart so that inspectors can see into areas not normally visible. \n \n The 737-300 is the oldest plane in Southwest's fleet, and the Dallas-based company is retiring 300s as it takes deliveries of new models. But the process of replacing all the 300s could take years. \n \n Seated one row from the mid-cabin rupture, Don Nelson said it took about four noisy minutes for the plane to dip to less than 10,000 feet. \"You could tell there was an oxygen deficiency,\" he said. \n \n \"People were dropping,\" said Christine Ziegler, a 44-year-old project manager from Sacramento who watched as a flight attendant and a passenger nearby fainted. Nelson and Ziegler spoke Friday after a substitute flight took them on to Sacramento. \n \n Brenda Reese described the hole as \"at the top of the plane, right up above where you store your luggage.\" \n \n At an altitude above 34,000 feet, the Southwest pilots would have had only 10 to 20 seconds of \"useful consciousness\" to get their oxygen masks on or pass out, said John Gadzinski, an airline pilot and aviation safety consultant. \n \n \"The higher you are the less useful consciousness time you have,\" said Gadzinski, president of Four Winds Consulting in Virginia Beach, Va. \"It's a credit to the pilots that they responded so quickly.\" \n \n A loss of cabin pressure just after takeoff knocked out the pilots of a Helios Airways Boeing 737 in August 2005. The plane flew into a hillside north of Athens in Greece, killing all 121 people aboard. In that case, an investigation found the pilots had failed to heed a warning that the pressurization system wasn't working correctly. \n \n In this case, the hole and subsequent depressurization wouldn't have affected the pilots' ability to control the plane as long as they had their oxygen masks on, Gadzinski said. \n \n \"The fact that you have a breach hole doesn't affect the aerodynamics of the plane. The plane still flies exactly the same,\" he said. \n \n A similar incident happened in July 2009 when a football-sized hole opened up in-flight in the fuselage of another of Southwest's Boeing 737s, depressurizing the cabin. The plane made an emergency landing in Charleston, W.Va. It was later determined that the hole was caused by metal fatigue. \n \n In response to that incident, Southwest changed its maintenance plan to include additional inspections, which FAA reviewed and accepted, said John Goglia, a former NTSB member and an expert on airline maintenance. The details of the plan are considered proprietary and aren't made public, he said. \n \n The latest incident \"certainly makes me think there is something wrong with the maintenance system at Southwest, and it makes me think there is something wrong with the (FAA) principal maintenance inspector down there that after that big event they weren't watching this more closely,\" Goglia said. \n \n There was \"never any danger that the plane would fall out of the sky,\" Goglia said. \"However, anybody on that airplane with any sort of respiratory problems certainly was at risk.\" \n \n Four months before that emergency landing, Southwest had agreed to pay $7.5 million to settle charges that it operated planes that had missed required safety inspections for cracks in the fuselage. The airline inspected nearly 200 of its planes back then, found no cracks and put them back in the sky. \n \n In 1988, cracks caused part of the roof of an Aloha Airlines Boeing 737 to peel open while the jet flew from Hilo to Honolulu. A flight attendant was sucked out of the plane and plunged to her death, and dozens of passengers were injured. \n \n After that incident, Boeing made changes to its designs \"to prevent the airplane from ever coming apart in that way again, by using different materials and manufacturing methods,\" Goglia said. \n \n Three years ago, an exploding oxygen cylinder ripped a hole the fuselage of a Qantas Boeing 747-438 carrying 365 people. The plane descended thousands of feet with the loss of cabin pressure and made a successful emergency landing. \n \n As for Friday's flight, there was obvious relief when it touched down safely. When the pilot emerged after the landing, passengers \"clapped and cheered,\" Redden said. \n \n \"If overhead bins weren't in the way, I'm pretty sure we would've given him a standing ovation,\" she said. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Lien Hoang, Don Thompson and Adam Weintraub contributed to this report from Sacramento, Calif.; David Koenig contributed from Dallas; Joan Lowy from Washington, D.C.; and Mark Evans and Robert Seavey from Phoenix. ||||| (Updates with possible impact on Sunday, other details) \n \n By Alex Dobuzinskis \n \n LOS ANGELES, April 2 (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines (LUV.N) canceled hundreds of flights over the weekend as it inspected 79 aircraft from its Boeing 737 fleet after one of its planes with a gaping hole in the fuselage made an emergency landing, the airline said on Saturday. \n \n The airline said was canceling some 300 flights on Saturday, a day after the emergency landing, and could cancel around that number again on Sunday. \n \n \"We don't at this time know what the impact will be, but it's possible that it could be in the 300-flight range again tomorrow,\" Southwest spokesman Brandy King told Reuters. \n \n Passengers aboard Southwest Flight 812 from Phoenix to Sacramento on Friday heard a loud noise and the hole appeared suddenly at about mid cabin, forcing the pilot landed at a military base in Yuma, Arizona. \n \n The emergency aboard the Boeing (BA.N) 737-300 prompted the airline to examine similar aircraft within its fleet, with a total of 79 inspections planned at five locations over the next several days, Southwest said in a statement. \n \n Southwest normally has about 3,400 flights on Saturday, King said, so the cancellations accounted for nearly 9 percent of that total. \n \n \"We did our best to accommodate those passengers on other Southwest flights,\" King said. \n \n A total of 931 Boeing 737-300s are operated by all airlines worldwide, with 288 of them in the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration said. \n \n The Southwest flight that was forced to make an emergency landing had 118 passengers and five crew members on board. \n \n Southwest and Boeing engineers will inspect the grounded aircraft, and the airline is working with federal authorities to determine the cause of the incident, Southwest said. \n \n The pilot made a rapid descent from about 34,400 feet (10.3 km) to 11,000 feet (3.4 km), following standard practice to reach an altitude where supplemental oxygen is no longer required, the FAA said. \n \n One flight attendant and at least one passenger were treated at the scene for minor injuries, Southwest said. \n \n The Boeing 737 landed at 4:07 p.m. local time after declaring an emergency, said Ian Gregor, an FAA spokesman. \n \n The airline said it arranged for another aircraft to take the passengers from the Yuma Marine Corps Air Station to Sacramento. \n \n Passengers described the harrowing scene to the CBS television affiliate in Sacramento, detailing the damage to the plane. \n \n \"They had just taken drink orders when I heard a huge sound and oxygen masks came down and we started making a rapid descent. They said we'd be making an emergency landing,\" a woman identified as Cindy told the station. \n \n \"There was a hole in the fuselage about three feet (91 cm) long. You could see the insulation and the wiring. You could see a tear the length of one of the ceiling panels.\" (Additional reporting by David Schwartz in Phoenix and Lauren Keiper in Boston; Editing by Greg McCune and Vicki Allen)",

Photo: Michael Macor, The Chronicle S.F. plane crash: Third victim dies 1 / 3 Back to Gallery \n \n A third passenger on the Asiana Airlines jet that crashed at San Francisco International Airport died Friday, the same day police confirmed that another girl killed during the disaster had been run over by a fire truck. \n \n The latest victim, who was described only as a girl under age 18, died Friday morning at San Francisco General Hospital of injuries she suffered when the Boeing 777 crashed last Saturday, said Dr. Margaret Knudson, the hospital's chief of surgery. \n \n The girl, whose name and age were not released, had been in critical condition since the airplane clipped a seawall, spun off the runway and burst into flames. \n \n Hospital officials said the girl's family had requested that no further information about her be revealed. The Chinese consul in San Francisco confirmed that she was a Chinese national. \n \n Earlier Friday, San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr confirmed that Ye Meng Yuan, 16, of China had been run over by firefighters trying to douse the flames engulfing Asiana Flight 214. However, he said, it still isn't clear whether Ye was already dead when she was hit. \n \n Her body was found amid foam that firefighters had sprayed on the burning airplane, Suhr said. \n \n \"We know for sure she was at least run over one time, but at the time she was under foam, so nobody could have seen her,\" Suhr said. \"And the question is whether or not she was still alive at the time.\" \n \n Ye's body was found near Flight 214's left wing, not far from one of the inflatable slides that several passengers used to escape from the plane. Ye, however, was sitting in the back of the plane, near where the tail broke off on landing, and would have been able to get out that way. One of the unanswered questions about her death is how she ended up by the wing. \n \n Spraying foam \n \n Police investigators said Friday that an airport fire rig that ran over Ye apparently hit her after all the passengers had been evacuated. The rig was spraying foam on the fire and was repositioning to get a better angle when Ye was struck, they said. \n \n \"It wasn't going that fast,\" said Officer Gordon Shyy, a police spokesman. \"When the firefighters repositioning the truck stopped, they realized there was a deceased person on the ground. She was lying down, covered in foam. They marked it, continued on to fighting the fire and notified the command chain there was a deceased person there.\" \n \n San Mateo County Coroner Robert Foucrault, whose office performed an autopsy, said Ye had suffered extensive crushing injuries, but does not appear to have been thrown from the airplane at the time of the crash. His investigators have not determined what killed her. \n \n Also killed in the crash was Ye's friend Wang Lin Jia, 16. Both girls had flown to the United States from Shanghai planning to visit Stanford University and attend a three-week summer camp at a Christian school in Southern California. \n \n Wang, who is also believed to have been sitting at the rear of the plane, was found near the seawall that Flight 214 struck at 11:27 a.m. Saturday as it attempted to land at well below its target speed. \n \n Third fatality \n \n The girl who died Friday was one of 31 children and 36 adults who were treated at San Francisco General. They were among 180 passengers and six flight attendants who were hurt in the crash. \n \n Six patients remain at San Francisco General. Two adults are in critical condition with spinal cord and abdominal injuries, internal bleeding, road rash and fractures, hospital officials said. \n \n The details emerged as National Transportation Safety Board workers began cutting up the hulk of the aircraft so they could take it to a hangar for storage. At 5:05 p.m. Friday, airport officials reopened the runway, 28L, on which Flight 214 had tried to land. ||||| The tail of Asiana Flight 214, which crashed on Saturday, July 6, 2013, is seen in front of a span of the Bay Bridge on a tarmac at San Francisco International Airport in San Francisco, Wednesday, July...

    "document": "There are abundant anecdotes and warnings of inappropriate behaviors on social networking sites, particularly about Facebook. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether individuals obsessively monitor or harass their ex-partners on Facebook (related to general \"Facebook stalking\") and, if so, whether those individuals would also engage in cyber obsessional pursuit (COP) and obsessive relational pursuit (ORI), which are categories of cyberstalking and stalking. A total of 411 valid participants answered questions about the ways they communicated with their ex-romantic partners using Facebook, resulting in three factors: Covert Provocation, Public Harassment, and Venting. Each category of Facebook harassment was related to perpetration of COP and ORI. Additionally, participants who engaged in COP were almost six times more likely to also perpetrate ORI. If participants admitted to engaging in some types of stalking behaviors, they did so online, offline, and on Facebook. Implications for social networking site usage and stalking laws are discussed. There is a kernel of truth to the popular term \"Facebook stalking.\" ||||| To cite this article: \n \n Tara C. Marshall. Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking. October 2012, 15(10): 521-526. doi:10.1089/cyber.2012.0125. \n \n Previous research has found that continuing offline contact with an ex-romantic partner following a breakup may disrupt emotional recovery. The present study examined whether continuing online contact with an ex-partner through remaining Facebook friends and/or engaging in surveillance of the ex-partner's Facebook page inhibited postbreakup adjustment and growth above and beyond offline contact. Analysis of the data provided by 464 participants revealed that Facebook surveillance was associated with greater current distress over the breakup, more negative feelings, sexual desire, and longing for the ex-partner, and lower personal growth. Participants who remained Facebook friends with the ex-partner, relative to those who did not remain Facebook friends, reported less negative feelings, sexual desire, and longing for the former partner, but lower personal growth. All of these results emerged after controlling for offline contact, personality traits, and characteristics of the former relationship and breakup that tend to predict postbreakup adjustment. Overall, these findings suggest that exposure to an ex-partner through Facebook may obstruct the process of healing and moving on from a past relationship. \n \n The present study examined whether online exposure to a former romantic partner contributed to breakup recovery and growth above and beyond offline exposure. Previous research has established that offline contact is associated with poorer postbreakup functioning; for example, almost half of university students who have experienced a breakup continue to see or talk with their former partner, 8 , 9 even though this contact is associated with greater sadness and love for the ex-partner. 10 From the perspective of social network analysis, 11 maintaining offline contact with an ex-partner may preserve a strong-tie contact\u2014frequent, reciprocal, and close contact\u2014that ultimately inhibits breakup recovery. On the other hand, remaining Facebook friends with an ex-partner and/or engaging in surveillance of his or her Facebook page may maintain a weak-tie contact\u2014infrequent, nonreciprocal, and casual contact. Weak ties can provide access to information that may not be obtained through strong ties, 12 such as information obtained through Facebook about the ex-partner's current activities. Such weak-tie contact may therefore sustain exposure to the ex-partner even in the absence of offline contact, potentially prolonging distress and longing for the former partner. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether weak-tie contact through Facebook sufficiently contributed to postbreakup functioning beyond strong-tie contact. This study also examined whether online contact was negatively related to breakup recovery and growth over and above certain personality traits (self-esteem, attachment style) and characteristics of the former relationship and breakup (e.g., feelings for the partner before the breakup, time since the breakup occurred) that consistently predict postbreakup adjustment. 8 , 13 The following hypotheses were tested: \n \n Other research suggests, however, that Facebook may facilitate behaviors associated with obsessive relational intrusion\u2014the unwanted pursuit of an intimate relationship, particularly with an ex-romantic partner. 7 Although Facebook surveillance falls on the mild end of the spectrum of relational intrusion, 3 research has found that monitoring an ex-partner's Facebook photos and other forms of covert provocation (such as writing a status update to make an ex-partner jealous) is associated with an increased likelihood of engaging in offline obsessive relational intrusion (e.g., showing up at the ex-partner's classroom or workplace). 4 Even for individuals who do not engage in relational intrusion, monitoring an ex-partner's online behavior may increase distress over the breakup and prolong pining for the former partner. For example, looking at an ex-partner's Facebook photos may renew desire for the former partner, or it may be upsetting to discover through Facebook that an ex-partner is involved in a new relationship. \n \n Many of the features that make Facebook attractive to its users\u2014easy, free, and anonymous access to information about others\u2014can also facilitate online monitoring behavior. Excessively checking others' Facebook profiles has been variously referred to as interpersonal electronic surveillance, 5 Facebook surveillance, 2 or, more colloquially, as \u201cFacebook stalking.\u201d In particular, people may use Facebook to keep tabs on an ex-partner's current activities by checking his or her status updates, wall posts, comments, and photos; even if one is no longer Facebook friends with an ex-partner, publicly available information\u2014such as a profile photo and list of friends\u2014can still provide a rough approximation of the ex-partner's ongoing activities. Recent estimates have suggested that one-half to two-thirds of people have made contact with an ex-partner through Facebook, 3 , 4 and that over half admit to having looked through an ex-partner's photos to find pictures of an ex-partner with a new romantic partner. 4 Not only is Facebook surveillance of ex-partners relatively common, then, but people who engage in it tend to perceive it as harmless. 6 \n \n W ith more than 900 million active users, Facebook is currently the world's most popular social networking website. The two most cited reasons for using Facebook are to keep in touch with others and to surreptitiously monitor their activities. 1 Not only do people use Facebook to monitor the activities of current romantic partners, 2 but as many as one-third use Facebook to keep tabs on former romantic partners. 3 While Facebook surveillance of ex-partners has been linked to negative outcomes such as online and offline relational intrusion, 4 the potential for Facebook contact and surveillance to disrupt emotional recovery and growth following a breakup has received little research attention. The current study sought to fill this research gap by examining whether remaining Facebook friends with a former partner and checking his or her Facebook profile is associated with continuing breakup-related distress, negative feelings, desire for the ex-partner, and inhibited personal growth. \n \n Current distress over the breakup was assessed with six items (e.g., \u201cHow much distress do you currently feel concerning the breakup?\u201d and \u201cHow heartbroken are you when you think about the breakup?\u201d). Participants indicated the extent of their negative feelings toward the ex-partner by rating how much anger, disappointment, confusion, hate, betrayal, hurt, frustration, and sadness they currently felt (selected in part from other work 10 , 17 ). Sexual desire for the ex-partner included items measuring lust, sexual arousal, and desire. All of the items measuring current distress, negative feelings, and sexual desire were rated on a 5-point Likert scale anchored with Not at all (1), A moderate amount (3), and A great deal (5). Longing for the ex-partner was assessed with four items 18 (e.g., \u201cI am still in love with my ex-partner\u201d) combined with three additional items 13 (e.g., \u201cEverything seems to remind me of my ex-partner\u201d). These items were rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from Strongly Disagree (1) to Strongly Agree (5). Finally, personal growth was measured by modifying the instructions of the 21-item Post-traumatic Growth Inventory 19 , 20 to ask participants how much life change they had experienced in different areas as a result of their breakup (e.g., \u201cI developed new interests\u201d). These items were rated with a 5-point Likert scale anchored with Not at all (1) and A great deal (5). \n \n Participants were asked if they currently had offline contact with the ex-partner and were Facebook friends with the ex-partner. These two variables were effect coded (1=Yes, \u22121=No). Facebook surveillance was assessed with two items that were equally applicable to people who were currently Facebook friends with the ex-partner and those who were not: \u201cHow often do you look at your ex-partner's Facebook page?\u201d and \u201cHow often do you look at your ex-partner's list of Facebook friends?\u201d These items were rated on a 9-point scale ranging from Never (1) to Several times a day (9). Participants were also asked how many Facebook friends they had and how much time in minutes they spent on Facebook on a typical day. \n \n Participants were asked to recall a distressing romantic breakup with someone whom they knew had a Facebook account. They indicated the status of the relationship before the breakup (nonexclusive dating, exclusive dating, cohabitating, engaged, or married), the length of the relationship, and how much time had passed since the breakup occurred. To assess feelings for the ex-partner right before the breakup, participants completed the six-item short-form of the Perceived Relationship Quality Components Inventory, 16 which assesses satisfaction, intimacy, trust, commitment, passion, and love. Two additional items were included that measured the degree of emotional involvement and sexual desire felt for the partner right before the breakup. Participants then indicated which partner initiated the breakup (\u201cI did,\u201d \u201cMy partner did,\u201d or \u201cWe both did\u201d). In the following analyses, initiator of the breakup was included as an effect-coded variable (1=partner initiated, \u22121=I initiated/we both initiated). Next, they wrote a description of the circumstances surrounding the end of the relationship, and completed the 16-item Breakup Distress Scale. 8 The instructions of this scale were modified to ask participants to recall the emotional distress they experienced immediately after the breakup occurred. Responses to this scale and to the measure of feelings for the partner before the breakup were rated on a 5-point Likert scale anchored with Not at all (1), A moderate amount (3), and A great deal (5). \n \n It was stated at the beginning of the survey that participants must have a Facebook account and have experienced at least one relationship breakup with someone who also has a Facebook account to be included in the study. Several questions at the end of the survey addressed demographic variables and current relationship status. Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the following scales are reported in Table 1 . \n \n Four hundred and sixty-four participants (84 percent female; M age =21.36, SD =5.49) were recruited by posting links to an online survey on several psychology survey-hosting websites (Social Psychology Network Online Social Psychology Studies, Psychological Research on the Net, and the intranet at the author's university). Eighty-seven percent were American, 7 percent were European, 2 percent were Canadian, 2 percent were Latin American, and the remainder were an international mix. Sixty percent of participants were currently working toward an undergraduate degree, 8 percent had completed an undergraduate or higher degree, and the remaining 33 percent had completed high school or A-levels. Forty-eight percent of participants were currently single; of those involved in a romantic relationship, 71 percent were exclusively dating their current partner, 8 percent were cohabitating, 8 percent were married, 7 percent were engaged, and 7 percent were nonexclusively dating. Current relationship status was included in the following analyses as an effect-coded variable (1=currently involved, \u22121=single). \n \n As seen in Table 3 , many of the personality traits and characteristics of the past relationship and breakup entered at Step 1 significantly contributed to variance in the dependent variables. Additionally, offline contact was positively associated with current distress, desire, and longing for the ex-partner. More pivotal to the present study, the two Facebook variables entered at Step 2 significantly contributed to variance in the dependent variables over and above the predictors entered at Step 1. Contrary to Hypothesis 1, remaining Facebook friends with the ex-partner was negatively associated with negative feelings, desire, and longing for the ex-partner. In support of Hypothesis 1, however, remaining Facebook friends was associated with lower personal growth. Consistent with Hypothesis 2, Facebook surveillance was positively related to current distress, negative feelings, desire, and longing for the ex-partner, and negatively related to personal growth. \n \n Table 3 reports the results of a series of hierarchical regression analyses that tested the predictors of current distress, negative feelings, sexual desire, longing for the ex-partner, and personal growth. For each analysis, the demographic and personality variables (age, sex, anxiety, avoidance, self-esteem), characteristics of the former relationship and breakup (length of the past relationship, feelings before the breakup, initiator status, breakup distress, length of time since the breakup, and current involvement), indices of Facebook usage (number of Facebook friends, average time per day in minutes spent on Facebook), and offline contact with the ex-partner were entered in Step 1. Average time per day spent on Facebook did not significantly contribute to any of the models, and was therefore removed. The key Facebook variables\u2014whether participants were currently Facebook friends with the ex-partner and Facebook surveillance\u2014were added in Step 2. \n \n Means and standard deviations are reported in Table 1 , and Pearson's correlations in Table 2 . Additional analyses revealed that 82 percent of participants had been exclusively dating their former partner before the breakup, 38 percent indicated that their partner had initiated the breakup, and 44 percent indicated that they continued to have some offline contact with the ex-partner. Of the latter participants, 73 percent described themselves as close or casual friends with the ex-partner, suggesting a strong-tie contact. Fifty-seven percent of all participants reported that they were still Facebook friends with the ex-partner; of these participants, over 90 percent indicated that the ex-partner's Facebook wall, photo albums, profile photo, status updates, and list of friends were visible to them. Forty-six percent of participants who were still Facebook friends with the ex-partner indicated that they exchanged Facebook messages and comments with this former partner (81 percent of whom also maintained offline contact); of the 54 percent who remained Facebook friends with the ex-partner, but did not exchange any Facebook-mediated communication, 53 percent did not maintain offline contact, suggesting a weak-tie contact. Of the people who were not Facebook friends with the ex-partner, 25 percent reported that they had defriended the ex-partner, 12 percent reported that the ex-partner had defriended them, and 6 percent reported that they had never been Facebook friends with the ex-partner at any point in time. Less than 50 percent of these participants had access to their ex-partner's Facebook wall, photo albums, and status updates, but 86 percent could see their ex-partner's profile photo, and 72 percent could see their ex-partner's list of friends. That the measure of Facebook surveillance was based on the frequency of checking the ex-partner's Facebook page (which includes the profile photo) and friends list is therefore consistent with the visibility of these elements even for those participants who were not currently Facebook friends with the ex-partner. \n \n Navigate Article Top of page Author information ABSTRACT Introduction Method Results Discussion << Author Disclosure Stateme... References CITING ARTICLES Discussion \n \n Taken together, these findings suggest that continued online exposure to an ex-romantic partner may inhibit postbreakup recovery and growth, even after accounting for the contribution of offline exposure and well-established personality and relational predictors. Notably, frequent monitoring of an ex-partner's Facebook page and list of friends, even when one was not a Facebook friend of the ex-partner, was associated with greater current distress over the breakup, negative feelings, sexual desire, longing for the ex-partner, and lower personal growth. These findings mirrored the correlates of offline contact, which was associated with greater current distress, sexual desire, and longing for the ex-partner, consistent with previous research.10 Facebook surveillance, therefore, accounted for aspects of postbreakup adjustment\u2014negative feelings toward the ex-partner and lower personal growth\u2014that offline contact did not. Importantly, these findings suggest that weak-tie contact with an ex-partner through Facebook contributed to poorer postbreakup functioning over and above strong-tie contact. Consistent with the view that weak-tie contact can supply information beyond strong-tie contact,12 Facebook may furnish information about an ex-partner that only intensifies heartbreak, such as news that the former partner is involved in a new relationship. \n \n Contrary to expectations, people who remained Facebook friends with an ex-partner were lower in negative feelings, sexual desire, and longing for the former partner than people who were not Facebook friends. Although it seems likely that people who remained Facebook friends may have had weaker feelings for their partner before the breakup or experienced a more amicable split than people who had defriended the ex-partner, remaining Facebook friends was not significantly correlated with previous feelings for the ex-partner or breakup distress. An alternative possibility is that unbidden exposure to the potentially banal status updates, comments, and photos of an ex-partner through remaining Facebook friends may have decreased any residual attraction to the ex-partner. Former partners with whom we are no longer in contact, by contrast, may remain shrouded in an alluring mystique, suggesting that remaining Facebook friends with an ex-partner may actually help rather than harm one's postbreakup recovery. \n \n Even so, people who remained Facebook friends were lower in personal growth than were those who had defriended the ex-partner, suggesting that even weak-tie contact with an ex-partner through remaining Facebook friends might disrupt the process of moving on. Although one might expect that the lower negativity, sexual desire, and longing for the ex-partner reported by participants who remained Facebook friends would be accompanied by greater, not lesser, personal growth, the former variables were not significantly correlated with personal growth. This lack of association is consistent with research that has found weak or nonsignificant relationships between indices of adjustment and personal growth following a traumatic event,21,22 suggesting that recovery and growth may be relatively independent processes. Indeed, healing from a relationship loss entails a process of recovering from negative emotions and detaching from the former partner, but also of developing a meaning-making narrative that enables personal growth.23 Thus, while remaining Facebook friends may benefit the breakup recovery process by mitigating negative emotions, desire, and longing for the ex-partner, it may simultaneously impede the construction of a personal growth-enhancing narrative. \n \n The most notable limitation of this study is that the correlational design did not allow conclusions to be drawn about casual direction. Although these results suggested that offline contact and Facebook surveillance lead to poorer postbreakup adjustment and lower personal growth, it is just as plausible that people who were hung up on an ex-partner were more likely to seek them out in person and engage in greater Facebook surveillance, which in turn sustained the pining for the former partner. Likewise, people who stagnated after a breakup rather than experienced personal growth may have been more likely to retain the ex-partner as a Facebook friend. An experiment that compares participants who are encouraged not to check their ex-partner's Facebook page for a period of time with other participants who may check freely could shed light on whether Facebook surveillance is causally related to poorer postbreakup adjustment and growth. Furthermore, while it was beyond the scope of the current article to examine the motives behind remaining Facebook friends with an ex-partner and engaging in Facebook surveillance, these motives could be profitably explored in future research. For example, people who feel betrayed by an ex-partner tend to experience heightened breakup distress,8 and the current findings linked breakup distress with a greater likelihood of engaging in Facebook surveillance (see Table 2). Perhaps, then, people are more likely to engage in Facebook surveillance if a former partner has been unfaithful. \n \n In spite of the need for further research, the take-home message from the present study is that keeping tabs on an ex-partner through Facebook is associated with poorer emotional recovery and personal growth following a breakup. Therefore, avoiding exposure to an ex-partner, both offline and online, may be the best remedy for healing a broken heart. ||||| It was in a weak moment of newfound singlehood that I thought, \u201cHmm, I wonder what he\u2019s up to now.\u201d Having severed our Facebook friendship, along with our romance, a few years ago, I clicked over to Flickr, the one place I knew could give me a glimpse into his life. And there it was: a self-portrait of him wearing a wedding ring. \n \n Ignoring the gender dictates of marital tradition, I irrationally rationalized that it was merely an engagement ring. \u201cNo, he\u2019s not married,\u201d I thought. \u201cIs he married? No way he\u2019s married.\u201d \n \n Internet-stalker style, I found further proof on Twitter: Someone had live-tweeted a photo from the wedding. There he was in his tux at the end of the aisle during the sunny, outdoor ceremony. There were shots too of the bride and the happy couple\u2019s Lego-people cake-topper. The term \u201cTMI\u201d is sorely overused, but this was the definition of it. It\u2019s one thing to realize that the man you once wanted to marry and have babies with is on that path with someone else, and another to be a virtual witness to it. \n \n Conventional wisdom, and even science, has it that cutting off contact with an ex makes for a smoother recovery. But nowadays \u2014 said in my best granny voice \u2014 it\u2019s much more difficult to get distance from an ex. (Funnily enough, my married ex is thousands of miles away \u2014 and it was the Internet that allowed our long-distance relationship to exist in the first place.) It isn\u2019t as easy as tearing your rotary phone from the wall. It isn\u2019t even as simple as deleting an ex\u2019s number from your cellphone. There\u2019s Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and the rest of the Internet with which to contend. \n \n My ex\u2019s live-tweeted marriage reminded me of this. So did my most recent breakup with a man whom I remain connected to via three social media platforms. But then there came yet another reminder this week \u2014 a study with a finding that will surprise no one: \u201cFacebook stalking\u201d an ex \u201cmay obstruct the process of healing and moving on from a past relationship.\u201d You can no longer pretend that hitting \u201crefresh\u201d on your ex\u2019s profile is helping you \u201cprocess.\u201d \n \n The study by Tara C. Marshall, a psychology professor at Brunel University, found that \u201cFacebook surveillance was associated with greater current distress over the breakup, more negative feelings, sexual desire, and longing for the ex-partner, and lower personal growth.\u201d More surprisingly, those who stayed Facebook friends with their ex \u201creported less negative feelings, sexual desire, and longing for the former partner\u201d \u2014 but they were \u201clower in personal growth.\u201d Marshall suggests this may be because \u201cunbidden exposure to the potentially banal status updates, comments, and photos of an ex-partner through remaining Facebook friends may have decreased any residual attraction to the ex-partner,\u201d whereas defriended exes \u201cremain shrouded in an alluring mystique.\u201d",

But at a Riverside County sheriff\u2019s news conference Tuesday, Jan. 16, she spoke about similar cases. \n \n At the half-hour briefing, where media crowded shoulder-to-shoulder into a conference room at the Perris sheriff\u2019s station, the girl who snuck out of the home and alerted authorities was praised for her bravery. \n \n Also, the CEO of the hospital where the seven adults \u2014 initially mistaken for minors because of their malnutrition \u2014 are being treated said the patients \u201cfeel safe\u201d and are stable. \n \n And a sheriff\u2019s captain promised a \u201cmeticulous investigation\u201d but couldn\u2019t provide any new insights into what motivated David Allen Turpin, 56, and Louise Ann Turpin, 49, to treat their children a way that resulted in the couple\u2019s arrest Sunday. \n \n The parents remained jailed Tuesday with bail set at $9 million each. Unless they post bail, under state law they must be charged by Thursday or freed from jail. \n \n Meanwhile, neighbors on Muir Woods Road in the suburban Riverside County city continued to express shock about the case, which has drawn media interest from such far-flung locales as New Zealand, Australia and the United Kingdom. \n \n Also Tuesday, the Sheriff\u2019s Department cautioned well-meaning people to donate to fundraising websites for the children with caution. Some may be phony. \n \n Physical, psychological damage \n \n Deputies who discovered the six minors and seven adults Sunday inside the dark, smelly home initially believed that all 13 were minors because they appeared so small. Three were chained and padlocked to furniture, authorities said. \n \n Grant indicated that in cases like this, such poor health would not have occurred in a short time. \n \n Stunting of growth, in general, would have been caused by malnourishment over \u201ca prolonged period,\u201d Grant said. \n \n The recovery will be gradual, she said. \n \n \u201cYou can imagine the post-traumatic stress disorder if you\u2019ve been deprived of nutrition, if you\u2019ve been deprived of normal childhood activities, normal interactions and the people who should have been providing for you have failed to do so \u2014 that is going to cause some psychological damage,\u201d Grant said. \n \n \u201cChildren who have been malnourished over a prolonged period will have growth stunting, will have nutritional deficiencies, they can suffer complications if you try to feed them, so it requires close monitoring of them when introducing proper nutrition to these kids. \u2026 The psychological support is going to be ongoing and longterm.\u201d \n \n The adults \u2013 five women and two men \u2014 are being treated at Corona Regional Medical Center and are being kept together and guarded by security. \n \n Hospital CEO Mark Uffer said he could not describe their conditions other than \u201cstable\u201d because of privacy laws. He described them as friendly and cooperative. \n \n \u201cI think they feel safe,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe they are hopeful that life will get better for them.\u201d \n \n Uffer said he had never seen a case like this. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s hard to think of them as adults when you first see them. They\u2019re small and it\u2019s very clear that they\u2019re (malnourished). \u2026 The way my staff has responded, I think they were horrified. I think they are very focused on improving the quality of their existence.\u201d \n \n The minors are being treated at Riverside University Health System Medical Center in Moreno Valley. \n \n What\u2019s next? \n \n Susan von Zabern, director of the Riverside County Department of Public Social Services, said the county plans to go to court to get authorization to oversee and care for the children. \n \n The minors could be placed with relatives after background checks, she said at the news conference. The adults\u2019 needs will be assessed and they will be offered services. \n \n Child Protective Services had never visited the home, von Zabern said. \n \n She urged people to report suspicions of abuse and neglect. \n \n The Riverside County Sheriff\u2019s Department also had not previously been called to the Turpins\u2019 home, said Capt. Greg Fellows, the commander of the Perris station. \n \n Investigators plan to dig into their background and want to know when the alleged mistreatment of their children began and what the motive was. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re going to conduct a meticulous investigation and we\u2019re going to get answers to all these questions,\u201d Fellows said at the news conference. \n \n He added that sheriff\u2019s officials believe that the couple are the biological parents of all 13 children. \n \n The Turpins have lived in Perris since about 2014, Fellows said. Before that, they lived in Murrieta, and before that in Texas. \n \n Media in Texas have reported that the Turpins lived in Tarrant and Johnson counties. There were no records of criminal cases involving the Turpins in those counties. CPS officials in Texas had no contact with the Turpins, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported. \n \n James and Betty Turpin of West Virginia told ABC News that their son David and his wife had so many children because \u201cGod called on them.\u201d In a brief statement to the Southern California News Group, they said they knew nothing about any mistreatment. \n \n Girl\u2019s courage praised \n \n The secrets being kept inside the four-bedroom, three-bathroom, 2,388-square-foot home were revealed Sunday when a 17-year-old girl escaped through a window carrying a cellphone she snatched. Fellows described it as \u201cdeactivated,\u201d but many phones allow someone to call 911 even when they\u2019re locked or not activated. \n \n When deputies arrived, the girl \u2013 who they thought looked about 10 years old \u2013 showed them photos that convinced them her 12 siblings were being held captive. \n \n \u201cWe do need to acknowledge the courage of the young girl who escaped from that residence to bring attention so they could get the help they so needed,\u201d said Fellows, who said he did not have any additional details on the escape. \n \n Not far from the station, Muir Woods Road residents were still in disbelief that such a sensational case could unfold in their neighborhood. \n \n \u201cIt still feels like a dream, it\u2019s not reality,\u201d Perris resident Ricardo Ross said Tuesday, adding: \u201cI woke up this morning and it\u2019s just devastating. Devastating news.\u201d \n \n Rosemberg Salgado has lived across the street from the Turpins since August 2016. \n \n \u201cYou would have never thought in this kind of neighborhood you could find out that there was some people who can do that to kids,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is just insane and crazy.\u201d \n \n The Turpins apparently lived largely out of sight. For one, they had been teaching six of their children in a private, in-home, state registered school, Sandcastle Day School, of which David Turpin was listed as principal. \n \n The state Department of Education said in a statement Tuesday that under California law, the agency does not have the authority to monitor or inspect private schools. \n \n State Assemblymember Jose Medina (D-Riverside), in emailed statement Tuesday, called for more oversight of private and home schools. \n \n \u201cI am extremely concerned,\u201d he said. \n \n Staff writers Shane Newell, Craig Shultz, Christopher Haire, Roxana Kopetman, Beatriz E. Valenzuela and Richard K. De Atley contributed to this report. \n \n Editor\u2019s note: This story has been updated to correct David Turpin\u2019s age and Louise Turpin\u2019s middle name.",

For Christie\u2019s staff in Trenton, the feeling toward the Romney machine was pretty much mutual. \n \n Many months after Romney\u2019s loss, that toxic relationship is revealed in page-turning detail in \u201cDouble Down,\u201d a chronicle of last year\u2019s grind-it-out election by journalists Mark Halperin and John Heilemann. The authors deploy the conversation-driving formula that propelled their previous book, \u201cGame Change: Obama and the Clintons, McCain and Palin, and the Race of a Lifetime,\u201d to bestseller status and a movie deal with HBO. (The same network has already optioned the rights to \u201cDouble Down.\u201d) The duo\u2019s M.O. \u2014 translating insider politics for mass-market readers with behind-the-scenes reporting and Gonzo flair \u2014 is custom-built for today\u2019s news cycle, in which scoops explode on Twitter and oblige the rest of the political media to chase, confirm, refute, scrutinize, analyze to death. The digital blast radius for \u201cDouble Down\u201d is infinite. \n \n \u201cDouble Down: Game Change 2012\u201d by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann (Penguin Press). (Penguin Press) \n \n And it will hit Christie first. Halperin and Heilemann make abundant use of a vice-presidential vetting file dropped into their hands by someone in Romney\u2019s orbit to illuminate secrets about the governor. Delivering the documents to the authors was a stunning breach of political decorum that can only be read as a giant middle finger at Christie and his aides. \n \n According to the authors, Romney and his team were shaken by what they discovered about Christie during \u201cProject Goldfish,\u201d as the hush-hush veep search process was known. His \u201cdisturbing\u201d research file is littered with \u201cgarish controversies,\u201d the authors write: a Justice Department investigation into his free-spending ways as U.S. attorney, his habit of steering government contracts to friends and political allies, a defamation lawsuit that emerged during a 1994 run for local office, a politically problematic lobbying career that included work on behalf of a financial firm that employed Bernie Madoff. And that\u2019s not to mention the Romney team\u2019s anxiety about the governor\u2019s girth. \n \n For Christie, who is coasting to reelection on Tuesday and already laying behind-the-scenes groundwork for a 2016 presidential bid, the book\u2019s revelations are a Drudge-ready public relations nightmare that will send his advisers scrambling to explain awkward aspects of his record and his personal life just as he is stepping onto the national stage. \n \n For Halperin and Heilemann (and their publisher), this means one thing: mission accomplished. \n \n Coming off the history-making spectacle of the 2008 race, the borderline\u00ad nihilistic presidential campaign of 2012 presents a challenge to authors seeking to spin a compelling tale. That may explain why the pair devotes considerable attention to the Republican primary contest, a more topsy-turvy drama than the trench warfare between Obama and Romney. \n \n The book lacks the made-for-Hollywood scenes of \u201cGame Change\u201d: Elizabeth Edwards ripping off her shirt to reveal her mastectomy scars in an emotional tarmac confrontation with her cheating husband, or anything Palin-related. But there\u2019s still click-bait aplenty: Obama meditating on drone strikes and telling his aides that he\u2019s \u201creally good at killing people\u201d; Christie\u2019s raging temper; Romney adviser Stuart Stevens vomiting backstage after Clint Eastwood\u2019s performance art in Tampa; Romney\u2019s fascination with fat people, including his habit of ribbing male campaign staffers about dating overweight women; George W. Bush calling Rick Perry, his gubernatorial successor in Texas, \u201ca chicken-[expletive] guy\u201d; Obama\u2019s team secretly polling and focus-grouping the notion of replacing Joe Biden with Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Democratic ticket; and so on. It\u2019s a book that will launch a thousand listicles. \n \n Such goodies were mined over three years from deep-background interviews with the candidates, their aides and the small galaxy of Washington fixers who surrounded the campaigns. The authors explain their hazy sourcing in a note at the book\u2019s conclusion; media snobs will have a field day. The Halperin-Heilemann method, a number of those who sat for interviews told me, is to invite a subject to a private room at a restaurant or a plush hotel suite, ply them with booze and let the stories flow. But the alcohol was unnecessary; the wild success of the first volume guaranteed that insiders would talk this time. Indeed, in a summer\u2019s worth of casual conversations with veterans of all the campaigns, it was difficult for me to find anyone who didn\u2019t consent to an interview with the pair. \n \n The book\u2019s loose argument is that both Obama and Romney placed their bets about the race early on and \u201cdoubled down\u201d throughout the contest. It\u2019s an apt take on Obama World. The \u201cObamans,\u201d as the authors call them, set out to annihilate Romney almost two years before the election and executed their plan with brutal efficiency. There were hiccups along the way, specifically Obama\u2019s dreary debate-prep sessions and his cringe-worthy performance in Denver, but his deputies in Chicago rarely deviated from their search-and-destroy mission. Romney\u2019s campaign, though, with its bad habit of reacting to news cycles with snap decisions, always felt more ad hoc, with tactics trumping strategy. \n \n Though the gossip merchants of This Town might be disappointed, readers are for the most part spared staff-level infighting and post-campaign score settling. There are exceptions: Former White House chief of staff Bill Daley comes in for rough treatment, depicted as a feckless outsider lost in the youthful, clannish and data-reliant Obama-verse. Although Romney\u2019s chief strategist, Stevens \u2014 a popular punching bag for know-it-all Republican consultants after the loss \u2014 emerges mostly unscathed, we witness some flashes of impetuousness. He was frustrated, it seems, to be the lone voice on Team Romney lobbying for Christie to be on the ticket instead of Paul Ryan, who is as much a cipher in the book as he was during the campaign: rarely mentioned and barely consequential. \n \n The authors\u2019 main project is to get into the minds of the candidates, even if the book does little to alter our understanding of the campaign\u2019s main players. Obama is brilliant but peevish, allergic to the nitty-gritty of politics. Romney is a decent man but hopelessly ham-fisted on the stump and oblivious to why voters can\u2019t seem to appreciate his private-equity r\u00e9sum\u00e9. \n \n As for the vice president, Biden is as Uncle Joe as ever: loyal to Obama and desperate to be in the arena, but prone to gaffes and rhetorical indulgences that give the president and his aides heartburn. Richard Ben Cramer\u2019s \u201cWhat It Takes\u201d remains the great ur-text of Bidenology. But the \u201cGame Change\u201d guys do dredge up what might be the Bidenest quote of all time: \u201cI don\u2019t understand why everyone\u2019s so mad at me,\u201d he tells a confidante, after endorsing same-sex marriage before the president did. God bless him. \n \n Obama\u2019s evolving relationship with Bill Clinton is one of the more intriguing tales of \u201cDouble Down.\u201d Aware that Clinton would be a crucial asset to the campaign, Obama World lured the former president to its side, even agreeing to pay off Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign debt in exchange for Bill\u2019s help. The two presidents slowly warmed to each other throughout the race. \u201cHe\u2019s luckier than a dog with two d----,\u201d Clinton told his friends of Obama. \n \n The real drama of the 2012 campaign unfolded on the Republican side: the Newt-killing, Perry-on-painkillers, 9-9-9, couple-of-Cadillacs theatrics of the Republican primary. After opening with some 80 pages of Obama portraiture, the authors gorge themselves on the hot mess of the GOP race for the next 200 pages. The most enjoyable action plays out among the \u201cRomneyites\u201d (yes, the authors have an annoying habit of sprinkling their text with gnomic nicknames; let this be the last time Rick Santorum is called \u201cSanto\u201d). The Romney campaign\u2019s methodical destruction of Gingrich, first in Iowa and again in Florida, is detailed, as is Romney\u2019s problematic lurch to the right as he fought off a conservative insurgency fronted by Santorum and his sweater vest. \n \n If Halperin and Heilemann have a bias, it\u2019s toward the candidates who stood a chance of winning \u2014 except for their recurring obsession with Donald Trump. Tim Pawlenty\u2019s campaign merits four pages. Ron Paul is an afterthought. Iowa straw poll winner Michelle Bachmann gets five pages, and the most memorable thing we learn is that she gets her hair done at a place called Fantastic Sam\u2019s. \n \n Jon Huntsman is the exception, and the authors\u2019 rendering of him is not pretty. Perhaps most damning for a candidate who professed to be above politics-as-usual, the authors report that the Huntsman campaign was behind two of the cycle\u2019s roughest news hits: peddling dirt to reporters on Mitch Daniels\u2019s wife, Cheri, a warning shot intended to keep the former Indiana governor out of the GOP field; and facilitating Politico\u2019s splashy story about Cain\u2019s apparent extramarital dalliances, a revelation that drove the pizza magnate from the race. \n \n Halperin and Heilemann fixate just as much on the Republicans who never set foot on a debate stage and who handed Romney enough breathing room and financial support to capture the nomination. Christie gets an entire chapter (titled \u201cBig Boy\u201d). Daniels, Haley Barbour and Mike Huckabee all receive more attention than Cain, who once topped the national polls. \n \n The Nate Silver wing of the Internet will almost surely gripe that the book is an example of political journalism\u2019s worst instincts \u2014 it\u2019s too dependent on the hunches and agendas of sources rather than hard measures of why Obama won. The authors ascribe colossal import to the tactical decisions and shouting matches inside campaign war rooms, but their dishy portraits often skimp on the larger forces that drove the race, from an improving economy and demographic shifts to Romney\u2019s charisma deficit and the Obama campaign\u2019s superior voter-contact machinery. \n \n Campaigns, though, aren\u2019t just about number-crunching and statistical analysis. Candidates matter. Voters tell pollsters that they make their choices based on issues such as education, health care, taxes and the economy \u2014 and they do. But they also care about temperament, empathy, strength, reason, trust and the human side of these strange and wily people who think they\u2019re up to the task of running the country. And as Halperin and Heilemann understand, so do readers. \n \n Read more from Outlook, friend us on Facebook, and follow us on Twitter. ||||| AP This will not go over well for the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner. \n \n According to the new book \"Double Down,\" in which journalists Mark Halperin and John Heilemann chronicle the 2012 presidential election, President Barack Obama told his aides that he's \"really good at killing people\" while discussing drone strikes. \n \n Peter Hamby of The Washington Post noted the moment in his review of the book. \n \n The reported claim by the commander-in-chief is as indisputable as it is grim. \n \n Obama oversaw the 2009 surge in Afghanistan, 145 Predator drone strikes in NATO's 2011 Libya operations, the May 2011 raid that killed Osama bin Laden, and drone strikes that killed the Pakistani Taliban leader and a senior member of the Somali-based militant group al-Shabab this week. \n \n His administration also expanded the drone war: There have been 326 drone strikes in Pakistan, 93 in Yemen, and several in Somalia \u2014 killing upwards of 4,000 people overall \u2014 under Obama, compared to a total of 52 strikes under George Bush. \n \n In 2011 two of those strikes killed American-born al-Qaeda propagandist Anwar al-Awlaki and his American-born, 16-year-old son within two weeks. \n \n Under Obama U.S. drone operators began practicing \"signature strikes,\" a tactic in which targets are chosen based on patterns of suspicious behavior and the identities of those to be killed aren't necessarily known. (The administration counts all \"military-age males\" in a strike zone as combatants.) \n \n Furthermore, the disturbing trend of the \"double tap\" \u2014 bombing the same place in quick succession and often hitting first responders\u2014 has become common practice under Obama's eye. \n \n Obama has also embraced the expansion of capture/kill missions by Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) after it developed into the primary counterterrorism tool of the Bush administration. \n \n One JSOC operator told investigative journalist Jeremy Scahill, author of \"Dirty Wars: The World Is A Battlefield,\" that global operations under Obama became \"harder, faster, quicker \u2014 with the full support of the White House.\" \n \n Scahill, who also made a \"Dirty Wars\" documentary, told NBC News that Obama will \"go down in history as the president who legitimized and systematized a process by which the United States asserts the right to conduct assassination operations around the world.\" \n \n Needless to say, a lot of innocent people have been killed along with combatants. \n \n So although President Obama has proven to be \"really good at killing people,\" the demonstration has not necessarily been noble. \n \n (h/t @kgosztola)",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A new book on the 2012 election has President Obama making a rather brutal claim, particularly, as Michael Kelley notes at Business Insider, for a Nobel Peace laureate: The president said to aides that he's \"really good at killing people.\" The quote comes from Double Down, by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, and it's mentioned briefly in Peter Hamby's Washington Post review. (Hamby gives it as an example of the book having \"click-bait aplenty.\") Kelley, for his part, observes that Obama's comment is quite accurate. While there were 52 total drone strikes while George W. Bush was president, Obama's administration has overseen 326 drone strikes in Pakistan, 93 in Yemen, and some in Somalia. That's on top of the surge in Afghanistan, the killing of Osama bin Laden, and drone strikes during NATO's Libya mission in 2011; Business Insider has even more examples.

    "document": "The research department at Airbus SA just seems like the funnest place to work these days. \n \n It\u2019s only a couple of months since the Toulouse, France-based company filed a patent application for a new ultra-economy class concept that looked like a row of bicycle saddles. Now its scientists have dreamed up something much more outlandish: a revolutionary, futuristic aircraft design where passengers sit in a circular cabin enclosed in a sort of delta-wing structure. \n \n Viewed from the side, the design looks like a raindrop on its side (or like some of the jet-propelled cars designed to break the world land speed record, if you prefer). Viewed from the top\u2013and this is what makes you wonder about how team in Toulouse dreamed it up\u2013it looks strangely reminiscent of a doughnut inside a \u201cJ\u00e9suite\u201d, a popular triangular French pastry. \n \n The filing suggests almonds would be removed to improve aerodynamic performance. \n \n According to the patent filing, Airbus\u2019 scientists say it could provide a \u201csimple, economic and efficient solution\u201d to one of the main shortcomings of the traditional cylindrical passenger cabin: the need for relatively heavy \u201csealed bottoms\u201d at the front and back of the tube to cope with the effects of pressurization. \n \n Sadly for enthusiasts of air travel and sci-fi films, it looks like the project is going to remain on the drawing board for the foreseeable future. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s just one of many ideas,\u201d a spokesman for the company said, pointing out that Airbus files for over 600 patents a year, mainly just for the sake of protecting intellectual property. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re going to be working on making it a reality.\u201d \n \n If Airbus were to try to develop the model commercially, it would have to overcome some formidable technical and regulatory obstacles. The fact that passengers are supposed to board from below via a hatch, for example, doesn\u2019t sit comfortably with regulations on emergency exits. And such a radical design might easily require changes to the infrastructure at airports (much like the A380 did). \n \n The Airbus spokesman couldn\u2019t confirm whether the staff canteen in Toulouse sells J\u00e9suites, either separately or together with doughnuts. ||||| The France-based company filed a patent application at the end of October for a new type of aircraft, structured to limit the strain of cabin pressurization. The design also offers space for more passengers, who will sit in a 360 degree cabin, rather like an amphitheater. \n \n In the U.S. patent application, citing the investors as Patrick Lieven, Romain Delahaye and Catalin Perju, Airbus said that the usual \"cylindrical geometry\" of aircraft increased pressure at the front and back of planes and limited passenger-carrying capacity. \n \n \"The purpose of the invention is particularly to provide a simple, economic and efficient solution to these problems to at least partially overcome the above-mentioned disadvantages,\" the filing said.",

Well, current aircraft face heavy pressure on their front and rear ends, requiring special support. \"The purpose of the invention is particularly to provide a simple, economic, and efficient solution to these problems,\" Airbus says. The new design, which you can view here, also offers more room for passengers, CNBC reports. The \"doughnut\" does, of course, have its drawbacks. Boarding hatches\u2014in the doughnut's \"hole\"\u2014don't clearly fit emergency exit rules, Fortune notes, and the aircraft's shape might require airport redesigns.

    "document": "At least two open investigations into... \n \n COLUMBIA, Mo. - University of Missouri officials have at least two open investigations into the potential use of \"date rape\" drugs at Delta Upsilon fraternity. \n \n ABC 17 News first reported Wednesday through an open records request the series of incidents that led to a temporary suspension of Delta Upsilon in late September. The fraternity was given disciplinary probation just a day before a racially-charged incident with students in the Legion of Black Collegians ended up in DU front lawn on September 27. The national organization placed its Columbia chapter on emergency suspension the next day, and the school's Office of Student Conduct continues to investigate that issue. \n \n DU received probation after several issues arose from parties on August 27 and September 10. A 20-year-old woman was taken by ambulance for an alcohol overdose, a man was pushed down a flight of steps during a fight and an 18-year-old girl tripped and hit her head after drinking too much at DU during the September incident. The fraternity had been given two warnings prior to that by the school for underage drinking and \"failing to comply\" with University police during a theft investigation. \n \n ABC 17 News uncovered a letter from the Title IX Office informing the fraternity of a possible investigation into use of \"date rape\" drugs. The letter, dated September 13, said the office received numerous contacts from students, along with social media posts that claim \"active members of Delta Upsilon fraternity allegedly provided each new member with three pills and instructed them to drug women for the purpose of incapacitating them prior to engaging in sexual activity.\" \n \n The letter from Title IX Administrator Ellen Eardley goes on to say, \"Should my office receive any information indicating that there is any veracity to the allegations that Delta Upsilon promoted sexual misconduct and hazing, an investigation will begin immediately.\" \n \n MU spokesman Christian Basi told ABC 17 News Thursday he could not comment on the status of that particular matter. \n \n An MUPD police report details a medical call on Sept. 16 for an 18-year-old student acting strangely in Johnston Hall. The woman was naked from the waist down, the officer wrote, and had \"smeared feces\" on the walls of the hall. She eventually went to the hospital with a friend and the police, telling them she had been drinking at several places, including DU. She did not see how made her drinks at that fraternity, according to the report. At University Hospital, officers took samples of her urine to test for drug intoxication that night. She also told officers she did not remember whether or not she had sex that night. \n \n Officer Bryanne Gawlik also wrote that the woman did not see who made her drinks that day. \n \n Major Brian Weimer confirmed that investigation is still open. \n \n Ashley Martin, DU national director of communications, told ABC 17 News the fraternity has \"worked tirelessly and collaboratively\" with the school to investigate these reports, some of which they had just learned about. Martin pointed to an \"internal membership review\" at Mizzou two years ago that led to the removal of 90 of its 123 members.They also reorganized chapter policy, including alcohol and guest rules. \n \n \"We will not condone or tolerate the type of behavior alleged in these incidents, and the chapter remains on a temporary suspension as our investigation continues,\" Martin said in an email. \"We are committed to holding all members to our code of conduct, and our investigation will help us determine whether our Missouri Chapter can positively contribute to a safe, enriching and inclusive campus environment.\" \n \n While individual students could face expulsion for any violations of student conduct, Basi said the fraternity as a whole could see \"withdrawal of recognition\" by the university. That means the fraternity could not use school spaces for anything, and it would be unable to participate in events like Homecoming.

    "document": "Four Key Races Could Determine Fate of U.S. Senate Control \n \n A lot more is happening on Election Day than just the race for president most notably, whether the Democrats will be able regain control of the Senate. ||||| The fight for control of the United States Senate is really close. It\u2019s basically a coin-flip. Democrats have a 53 percent chance of winning a Senate majority according to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s polls-plus model, or a 52 percent chance according to our polls-only forecast. There is about a 16 percent chance, in fact, that we\u2019ll end up with a 50-50 Senate and the presidential race will decide control. (The vice-president breaks ties in the Senate.) \n \n There are structural factors working in both parties\u2019 favor. Republicans hold 24 of the 34 seats that are up for reelection in 2016. Democrats, therefore, have more opportunities to pick up seats than Republicans. The political geography also favors Democrats. Of the 10 seats Democrats are defending, none are in states that were won by either John McCain or Mitt Romney in 2008 or 2012. Republicans, by contrast, are defending a lot of turf that\u2019s either blue or purple. That\u2019s because the last time these seats were up for reelection was in 2010, a GOP-wave year when Republicans won a lot of seats in Democratic-leaning territory. In total, nine of the GOP-held seats up for grabs on Tuesday are in states that President Obama won in either 2008 or 2012. \n \n On the other hand, Republicans are defending those seats \u2014 that is, they have more incumbents on the ballot. Incumbent candidates generally outperform non-incumbent candidates, all else being equal. And indeed, Republican incumbents are generally polling better than Donald Trump. \n \n Speaking of the presidential race, one of the clearest trends this cycle has been that Democratic chances of taking back the Senate have generally run hand-in-hand with Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances of winning the presidency. \n \n The past few weeks have been no different. Democrats, who in the middle of October held a clear advantage in their fight for a Senate majority, have seen their fortunes fall as the presidential race has tightened. This matches a pattern seen over the previous few election cycles: More voters casting their ballot for the same party in both Senate and presidential races. There is some good news for Senate Democrats in this tightening, though: If voters think Clinton is less of a sure bet to win the presidency, they may be less likely to vote for Republicans in down-ballot races in order to act as a check on her power. That seemed like a possibility after Clinton opened up a large lead over Trump after the first debate in late September. \n \n OK, so that\u2019s the broad view of where things stand. Republicans currently hold 54 Senate seats. Democrats have 46 (including independents Angus King of Maine and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who caucus with them). So Democrats need to pick up a net gain of four seats for a tie, or five seats to get an outright majority. \n \n The FiveThirtyEight Senate forecast has 11 seats to watch. Let\u2019s go through those 11 seats, from most likely to go Democratic to least likely, according to the polls-plus model. I\u2019ve also added two extra wild-card races to keep an eye on as the returns come in Tuesday. \n \n Likely Democratic pickup \n \n Illinois (97 percent chance of a Democratic win in polls-plus forecast) \n \n Republican Sen. Mark Kirk was always facing an uphill battle in solidly blue Illinois. Clinton is favored to win the state by more than 10 percentage points, and no Republican has won a Senate race in Illinois in a presidential election cycle since 1972. Kirk wasn\u2019t helped when Democrats were able to recruit Rep. Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq-war veteran, to challenge him. Kirk has the voting profile (moderate) and geographic base (suburbs of Chicago) that a Republican needs to win a statewide race in Illinois, but even so he would have had to run an almost perfect campaign to have a chance. He hasn\u2019t. He also had to fight off the belief among some voters that a stroke he suffered while in office has limited his effectiveness. If Kirk is to upset Duckworth, he\u2019ll have to hold her margin in Cook County (Chicago) under 35 percentage points and lose pretty much no place else. \n \n Probable Democratic pickup \n \n Wisconsin (86 percent) \n \n Wisconsin may be closer than our forecast suggests: Our model may not have fully picked up a late shift in the polls toward incumbent Republican Sen. Ron Johnson. Democrats were able to recruit former Sen. Russ Feingold to take on Johnson, and polls showed Feingold as the favorite for most of the year. Wisconsin hasn\u2019t voted for a Republican for Senate in a presidential year since the Republican wave of 1980, and Johnson has a very conservative record. Johnson, though, appears to be mounting a comeback. Both Democratic and Republican groups have invested heavily in the race in the past few weeks. And Marquette University, perhaps the most reliable pollster in Wisconsin, put Johnson down just 1 percentage point in its final survey of the race. Other recent polls also point to a close contest. Feingold is still a favorite, and he will probably be helped by Clinton\u2019s coattails \u2014 she holds a healthy lead over Trump in the state. But keep an eye on eye on the traditionally Republican-leaning counties outside of Milwaukee to see by how much Johnson is outperforming Trump. If it\u2019s by a lot, as some polls suggest, Johnson has a shot. \n \n Leaning Democratic \n \n Pennsylvania (67 percent) \n \n Yet another seat won by a Republican in a midterm election that will be harder to hold in presidential year. (Are you noticing a trend?) Republican Sen. Pat Toomey is one of the most conservative senators in Congress, despite representing a state that tends to vote Democratic in presidential elections. Beltway Democrats were able to get their preferred candidate, Katie McGinty, through a competitive primary, but the race between McGinty and Toomey was neck-and-neck through early October. Since then, however, McGinty has opened a small lead in almost every poll. Toomey has had his hands full with Trump, trying to keep his distance without outright disavowing the GOP nominee. McGinty, on the other hand, is probably going to be helped by Clinton, who is a favorite to win the state. Watch Chester County in the southeast part of the state. Chester County traditionally votes Republican, but Clinton is expected to overperform there. Toomey may need some ticket-splitting in that county to win the state. \n \n Tossups \n \n Missouri (44 percent), Nevada (56 percent), New Hampshire (52 percent) \n \n These are the three seats where the Senate is most likely going to be decided. If Democrats win two of these three, it\u2019s difficult to see how they don\u2019t end up with at least 50 Senate seats. If they don\u2019t, they\u2019ll have to pick up at least one seat that appears to be trending away from them. \n \n Missouri is perhaps the most interesting of the three because it\u2019s the state where we have the best chance of seeing one party win the Senate race and the other win the presidential race. Although Trump should win easily in Missouri, Democrat Jason Kander has made the Senate race there quite competitive. Running on his biography as an Army veteran and outsider, Kander has fought his way to a near tie against Republican Sen. Roy Blunt. Blunt seems to have been caught flat footed, tagged as a Washington insider while his party\u2019s presidential nominee runs against Washington. Still, Kander seems to have hit a wall in recent polls. Blunt has the slightest of edges in our forecast, but the race is really too close to call. One county to pay extra attention to is Jefferson County, near St. Louis, which has a history of matching the statewide vote. In 2012, the final margins in the gubernatorial, presidential and Senate races in Jefferson looked a lot like the state as a whole. \n \n If turnout for Trump might help Blunt in Missouri, he\u2019s likely to hurt Republican Joe Heck in Nevada. Heck is running against Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto to fill the seat of retiring Democratic Sen. Harry Reid. Heck, like Toomey in Pennsylvania, has struggled to figure out how exactly to deal with the Republican presidential nominee. While the polls point to a close race, the early vote in Nevada has been decidedly negative for Republicans. That doesn\u2019t mean Heck is toast. Four years ago, Republican Sen. Dean Heller was able to win by 1 percentage point even as President Obama carried Nevada by 7 points. Heller, though, benefitted from a Democratic opponent who had ethics problems. Heck doesn\u2019t have that luxury. Heck\u2019s best chance is to win a larger share of Latinos than Trump in Clark County, where they are turning out in large numbers. \n \n Unlike in Nevada, the recent trends have been good for Republicans in New Hampshire. Trump has closed the gap with Clinton there, and Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte has made her race with Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan a tossup again. There\u2019s a touch of irony in Ayotte\u2019s fate being tied to Trump\u2019s; she has said she won\u2019t vote him after facing backlash for calling him a good role model during a debate. The tight race shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise: New Hampshire is the ultimate swing state. On the presidential level, it has been within a few percentage points of the national vote in every election since 1996. This year looks to be no different. With two well-known candidates running, the race looks like it will come down to the wire. The candidate who carries the independent vote in the state (which has one of the largest independent votes in the nation) will probably win the race. \n \n Plausible Democratic pickups \n \n Indiana (40 percent), North Carolina (30 percent) \n \n Democrats thought they hit the jackpot when they were able to recruit former Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh into the race to replace retiring Republican Sen. Dan Coats. Bayh had been a two-term governor and senator. He also had a giant fundraising war-chest and opened the race with a large lead over Republican Todd Young. But that advantage has evaporated in the past few months. That\u2019s not totally surprising given Trump is expected to easily carry the state. Bayh, though, hasn\u2019t helped his cause. He\u2019s been tied to Washington lobbyists and has been questioned on how much time he really spends in Indiana. Young, for his part, has improved his name recognition. The result is that Young took his first lead in a public poll in the last two weeks. Still, the race is close and could be won by either candidate. To win, Bayh will need strong turnout in heavily black Lake County (Gary) and Marion County (Indianapolis). \n \n Democrats have a different problem in North Carolina. Republican Sen. Richard Burr had probably hoped the slight Republican tilt of the Tar Heel State would ensure his re-election, especially after the Democrats\u2019 strongest potential candidate, Attorney General Roy Cooper, decided to run for governor instead. That left Democrats with Deborah Ross, a lawyer and former member of the North Carolina House of Representatives. Ross has kept it close with Burr the entire campaign, but she\u2019s never been able to overtake him. That makes this race the only one examined so far in which the Democrat has never led in the FiveThirtyEight polls-plus forecast. There are very few swing voters in North Carolina, so the race is all about turnout: If Clinton outperforms expectations in the presidential race by just a few points, she might carry Ross across the finish line. \n \n Longshot Democratic pickup \n \n Florida (13 percent) \n \n Democrats were a favorite to win the Senate seat in Florida until Republican Sen. Marco Rubio changed his mind and decided to run for reelection after all. Rubio has held a consistent lead over Democrat Patrick Murphy. Rubio has strong ties to Cuban communities in Florida, and he\u2019s expected to vastly exceed Trump\u2019s poll numbers among Hispanics in the Sunshine State. Keep an eye on heavily Cuban Miami-Dade County to see how much Rubio is outperforming Trump\u2019s margins with Cubans. Murphy, for his part, has been called out for exaggerations about his record and has attacked Rubio for supporting Trump, even after Rubio called Trump a con artist in the presidential primary. For whatever reason, the attacks don\u2019t seem to be sticking. Rubio\u2019s advantage is so large at this point that it\u2019s difficult to imagine Murphy winning even if Clinton wins the state. \n \n Really long shot Democratic pickups \n \n Arizona (3 percent), Ohio (2 percent) \n \n Early polls indicated that incumbent Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Rob Portman of Ohio might be in trouble. And Democrats recruited strong candidates: Ann Kirkpatrick in Arizona and former Gov. Ted Strickland in Ohio. But McCain and Portman have been perhaps more successful than any other Republican Senate candidates in distancing themselves from Trump. Portman was also helped by a massive fundraising advantage over Strickland. \n \n Wild cards \n \n Colorado (95 percent), Louisiana (14 percent) \n \n No one has talked about Colorado as a potential Republican pickup. Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet has only trailed in one poll all year against Republican Darryl Glenn. Colorado, though, is still a swing state in presidential elections, even if Clinton is favored to win it this year. It also elected a Republican to the Senate in 2014. And Bennet\u2019s lead in the polls has shrunk to within single digits over the past month. Bennet will almost certainly still win, but don\u2019t be surprised if the race ends up closer than many once thought it would be. \n \n Louisiana is something entirely different. The state will hold on a primary on Tuesday in which all the Democratic candidates and Republican candidates run against each other. As long as no candidate gets 50 percent (and there\u2019s basically no chance of that happening), the two top vote getters regardless of party affiliation will advance to a runoff. It\u2019s expected that one of those candidates will be Republican John Kennedy who leads in the polls. But Democrats Foster Campbell and Caroline Fayard are not too far behind Kennedy in second and third respectively. With five Republicans projected to get at least 4 percent of the vote, it\u2019s possible that Republicans will split their vote enough that Kennedy drops to third and both Democrats end up advancing. Keep in mind that polls are much more likely to be wrong in primaries than in general elections. \n \n It is possible that one party will win most of the battleground races. The polls are sometimes off in the same direction in multiple races. That happened in 2014 when Republicans beat their polls across the board. If that happens again, then some of the long-shot candidates may end up as surprise winners. \n \n Still, the polls show a close overall race \u2014 about as close as you can get. In nearly half of our simulations, the Senate ends up as either tied or 51-49 in one direction or the other. So as you watch the presidential race unfold, remember that it\u2019s not just determining control of one branch of government but potentially half of another branch as well. ||||| \n \n McCain debates Kirkpatrick on Oct. 10 in Phoenix. (Ross D. Franklin/AP) \n \n Arizona \n \n Sen. John McCain (R) is poised to win a sixth term after a tough two-front battle with his state\u2019s far-right wing and Democrats accusing him of flipping his positions to fit the moment. \n \n McCain, 80, first had to get through a primary against Kelli Ward, who ran as a tea party insurgent proudly backing Donald Trump and aped Trump\u2019s criticism of McCain over veterans\u2019 legislation. McCain won comfortably, but received a tad more than 50 percent of the GOP vote. \n \n That set up a quick and potentially difficult general-election battle against Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick (D), who represents the state\u2019s largest district. But McCain quickly galvanized most of the Republican vote, running as a check against a possible Hillary Clinton presidency and trying to steer clear of discussing Trump. \n \n Kirkpatrick has aired tough ads showing McCain\u2019s changing positions, including in 2010 calling for a \u201cdanged fence\u201d along the Mexican border. But Washington Democrats took a pass on engaging the race. Both the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and its super PAC ally, Majority PAC, have not devoted resources to the race. \n \n McCain formally dumped Trump in early October. A CNN poll showed him with a 13-point edge in the past week. \n \n \u2014 Paul Kane \n \n \n \n Harris gives a thumbs up to supporters during her visit to the campaign office of Rep.

Barbara Boxer (D) announced her retirement, California Attorney General Kamala Harris became the instant front-runner. Other Democrats stepped back, and no strong Republicans came forward in the deep-blue state. \n \n Enter Rep. Loretta Sanchez (D). Sanchez made it through the June primary, defeating several GOP candidates to finish a distant second to Harris. State election rules allow the top two finishers, regardless of party, to advance to the general election. But the Orange County congresswoman has struggled to catch up to Harris, who in recent polls was leading by more than 20 points. \n \n Sanchez has campaigned as a moderate and she\u2019d hoped to mobilize Latinos, California\u2019s largest ethnic group. She has modest leads with Latino voters in polls, but Harris boasts double-digit margins with nearly every other demographic group. \n \n Harris has the backing of the California Democratic Party, labor unions and progressive groups, and President Obama, who appeared in a campaign ad for her. \n \n Sanchez, 56, would be the first Latina elected to the Senate. Harris, 52, whose parents emigrated from Jamaica and India, would become the second black woman elected to the Senate since 1992. \n \n \u2014 Vanessa Williams \n \n \n \n Rubio, right, and Murphy debate on Oct. 26 at Broward College in Davie, Fla. (Wilfredo Lee/AP) \n \n Florida \n \n The most important day in Florida\u2019s Senate race was June 22, when GOP Sen. Marco Rubio announced that he would seek reelection \u2014 reversing a pledge he made when he began his ill-fated presidential campaign. Without Rubio, Republicans faced a messy primary featuring several unknown, untested candidates. Democrats, meanwhile, thought they had a winner in Rep. Patrick Murphy, a young up-and-comer who had triumphed in the nastiest and most expensive House race of 2012. Rubio\u2019s reversal instantly gave the GOP an advantage, and they have not given it up. \n \n Rubio and GOP allies have spent tens of millions of dollars attacking Murphy, trying to paint him as a spoiled rich kid with a questionable professional record. Murphy has fought back with ads capitalizing on Rubio\u2019s presidential ambitions and his poor Senate attendance record while pursuing them. But Democrats pulled millions of dollars of ad reservations over the course of the fall as other races proved to be more competitive, leaving Murphy unable to match Rubio dollar for dollar. \n \n Murphy hasn\u2019t caught up in polling, but he\u2019s not far behind. A late influx of Democratic spending and a stronger-than-expected Clinton win could spell an upset \u2014 and a devastating loss for Rubio. \n \n \u2014 Mike DeBonis \n \n \n \n Kirk, right, and Duckworth debate on Oct. 27 at the University of Illinois in Springfield. (Seth Perlman/AP) \n \n Illinois \n \n Sen. Mark Kirk (R) has used a wheelchair since he had a stroke in 2012, and against virtually any other opponent, his return to the Senate would be a powerful narrative on which to run. \n \n But his Democratic opponent, Rep. Tammy Duckworth, has a story just as powerful, having lost her legs in 2004 when her helicopter in Iraq was struck by an enemy rocket. It was during her recuperation that her home state\u2019s two Democratic senators \u2014 Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama \u2014 drafted her into politics. She has run a cautious but competent campaign withstanding attacks on her tenure as head of the state Department of Veterans Affairs and on her thin legislative record. \n \n For Kirk, meanwhile, reelection was a tough bet, as Illinois last elected a Republican senator in a presidential year in 1972. And Kirk is his own worst enemy, talking his way into controversies that culminated in the most stunning congressional debate gaffe of 2016. \n \n After Duckworth described her family\u2019s military heritage, Kirk said he had \u201cforgotten that your parents came all the way from Thailand to serve George Washington.\u201d Although Duckworth\u2019s mother is a Thai immigrant, her late father\u2019s lineage can be traced to the Revolution. \n \n \u2014 Mike DeBonis \n \n \n \n Bayh participates in debate for Indiana's open U.S. Senate seat in Indianapolis on Oct. 18.

(Michael Conroy/AP) \n \n Indiana \n \n Everything changed in Indiana\u2019s Senate race when former senator Evan Bayh (D) announced on July 11 that he would be running to retake his seat. Until that day, Republicans were convinced that Rep. Todd C. Young (R) had an easy path to victory. Bayh entered the race with strong support from Democrats, who have fond memories of his time as governor and senator. \n \n But Bayh proved ill-prepared for a punishing Senate contest and has been pummeled by accusations that he is a Washington insider who is out of touch with Hoosiers. First, he incorrectly listed the address of his Indianapolis condominium, then he battled reports that he spent the final days of his last Senate term interviewing for high-paying jobs. \n \n A poll conducted Oct. 22 to Nov. 3 by WTHR-TV and Howey Politics shows Bayh trailing by five points. \n \n Young, who served as a Marine, has made a name in the state as fresh-faced alternative to Bayh\u2019s storied career. His campaign has benefited from a flood of outside support from groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Senate Leadership Fund, the Karl Rove-backed super PAC run by former aides to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). \n \n \u2014 Kelsey Snell \n \n \n \n Kander speaks to supporters at a St. Louis union hall on Nov. 1.

It was a viral TV ad that had Kander assembling a military-style rifle with a blindfold that caught Washington\u2019s eye, but it\u2019s months of disciplined, pitch-perfect campaigning that puts him within a hair of unseating Roy Blunt (R) in a state likely to favor Donald Trump by double digits. \n \n Kander, who was an Army intelligence officer, has leaned heavily on his military background and has found a receptive audience for his attacks on Blunt as a Washington insider. \n \n Republican groups have been forced to come to Blunt\u2019s rescue, financing ads linking Kander to Hillary Clinton and President Obama \u2014 some of them showing Kander\u2019s face morphing into theirs. \n \n Kander, meanwhile, has not passed up an opportunity to remind voters that Blunt lives in a D.C. mansion and that his wife and three of his children are lobbyists. And although Blunt has not distanced himself from Trump, he fits the profile of the D.C. denizen Trump is running against. Virtually every independent poll since September has shown a tied race or Blunt leading within the margin of error. \n \n \u2014 Mike DeBonis \n \n \n \n Cortez Masto shakes hands with Heck after an Oct. 14 debate in North Las Vegas.

Joe Heck (R), who represents the Las Vegas suburbs, against former state attorney general Catherine Cortez Masto (D), who would be the first Latina senator. The state is difficult to poll, both because of its new Hispanic population and because employees working in the Las Vegas gambling and nightlife industry are hard to reach. \n \n Divergent polls show Heck leading by about seven points, or Cortez Masto ahead by the same margin. Neither candidate has broken through policy-wise, nor has either\u2019s personality crashed through the din of commercials here. \n \n Much of Heck\u2019s campaign isn\u2019t focused on his rival but instead on Reid \u2014 casting him as a villain who chose his puppet to succeed him. And Cortez Masto\u2019s is focused on Donald Trump, trying to energize Hispanics and mocking Heck\u2019s wavering support for the GOP nominee. \n \n The race may be decided in \u201cthe rurals,\u201d counties far away from the Las Vegas Strip where Trump is expected to do well. Heck has withdrawn his support for Trump and called for him to quit the race, which may be why he is underperforming there. \n \n \u2014 Paul Kane \n \n \n \n Ayotte, left, and Hassan during a Nov. 2 debate.

The latest Boston Globe poll, conducted at the end of October, showed Ayotte leading by 2.5 points, well within the margin of error. \n \n The outcome of the closely watched race is expected to play a critical role in determining which party will hold the Senate majority next year. \n \n Ayotte, a former state attorney general, has struggled to overcome a powerful downdraft created by the unpopularity of Donald Trump. She sank in the polls when struggling to respond to a leaked 2005 recording of Trump talking about kissing women and grabbing them without their consent \u2014 at first standing by Trump and eventually rescinding her support. \n \n Hassan has benefited from running as a well-liked sitting governor but she has struggled to eke out a consistent lead. Hassan had to overcome her own gaffe when she struggled to answer whether she thinks Hillary Clinton is honest and trustworthy. \n \n The race has attracted more than $89 million in spending from outside groups, making it the second most expensive Senate contest this year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. \n \n \u2014 Kelsey Snell \n \n \n \n Strickland greets a poll worker before voting at the Franklin County Board of Elections on Oct. 27.

Rob Portman (R) was originally expected to be fighting for his political life in the campaign\u2019s final days. \n \n A consummate insider, having worked in both Bush administrations and as part of the House GOP leadership, he seemed ill-suited for the anti-Washington environment epitomizing this cycle. \n \n But Portman seems to have prevailed after running what was probably the best race of any Republican candidate this year. He raised more money than all but one Senate Republican (Patrick J. Toomey, who is in a close contest), and spent it early and often, a smart tactic in hindsight. \n \n His ads reintroducing voters to their first-term senator were effective, portraying his work to fight an opioid crisis with Senate legislation and to combat sex trafficking. Meanwhile, Portman\u2019s negative ads battered Ted Strickland, who began the race as a well-liked former governor. But after being reminded of the job losses during Strickland\u2019s term, voters had turned against the ex-governor by late August. National Democrats abandoned the race. \n \n Of the 10 most recent public polls, all in October, Portman had a lead of at least 11 points.

He has the old-school campaign ethos to match. \n \n National Republicans fumed as he stuck with the winning formula from his previous two runs: Keep your powder dry until October, then hold on for dear life at the end. His opponent is Deborah Ross, a lawyer and former state lawmaker whose record as a civil-rights advocate many assumed would be too liberal for the state. \n \n But Ross has proven a masterful fundraiser and fierce campaigner, and an avalanche of ads highlighting her past objections to the state\u2019s sex-offender registry seem not to have deeply affected voters. Polls have shown a tight race for months, and although Burr has had a small lead in most recent polls, he has not been able to run far ahead of Donald Trump in a state where Democrats are making an extra-hard turnout push. \n \n The final week was roiled when Burr was recorded in a private meeting cracking a joke about gun owners putting a \u201cbullseye\u201d on Hillary Clinton. Ross, meanwhile, has benefited from a pair of presidential visits. \n \n \u2014 Mike DeBonis \n \n \n \n McGinty and Toomey at a debate at Temple University in Philadelphia on Oct. 24.

Democrats always believed their path to the majority probably required knocking off Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R). Toomey tells supporters everywhere that their votes will keep the Senate in Republican hands. \n \n Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), the incoming Democratic leader, recruited neophyte Katie McGinty, persuading Vice President Biden to coax President Obama to endorse her in the primary. \n \n Toomey and McGinty are basically deadlocked. McGinty has held a small lead in the past few polls \u2014 but over the past month, four showed the race tied and four gave Toomey a slight lead. \n \n Toomey is performing well in the vote-rich Philadelphia suburbs. But he is doing less so in the rural stretch between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, in part, strategists say, because he hasn\u2019t said whom he supports for president. That may work near Philadelphia, where Hillary Clinton is crushing Donald Trump, but Trump is well-liked elsewhere. \n \n Whichever party wins this race will have the edge to win the majority. \n \n \u2014 Paul Kane \n \n \n \n Johnson, left, and Feingold, right, meet in their second and final debate Oct. 18 in Milwaukee.

It has been a reliably blue state in presidential years, one-term incumbent Ron Johnson (R) had not done much to raise his profile and well-known former senator Russell Feingold (D) had signed up for a rematch. \n \n Summer polls showed Feingold with a double-digit lead, but the well-respected Marquette Law School Poll found last week that that margin had shrunk to a single point amid a late GOP ad blitz. \n \n In the final week of the campaign, about $6 million was spent by campaigns, party committees, super PACs and outside groups \u2014 many of which had canceled earlier reservations. \n \n Johnson, an Oshkosh plastics manufacturer, has sought to refresh his image as a no-nonsense outsider businessman, while casting Feingold as a career politician and a throwback. Feingold, meanwhile, has relentlessly driven a middle-class economic message focused on opposition to trade deals and tax loopholes, while tarring Johnson as an advocate for corporate interests. \n \n Although the race has tightened, Democrats and some Republicans think Feingold has an edge: Early voting has outpaced expectations in Democratic strongholds, and Johnson is only now showing signs of outpacing Donald Trump. \n \n \u2014 Mike DeBonis",

Bush for the Republican nomination in the South Carolina primary. McCain had recently upset Bush in New Hampshire and was in a buoyant mood, vowing that, like \u201cLuke Skywalker fighting the Death Star,\u201d he would not only defeat Bush but reform a party corrupted by \u201cbig money\u201d and, as he later put it, \u201cagents of intolerance.\u201d \n \n Within days, sordid attacks began to appear: flyers on car windows claiming that McCain, who had adopted an orphan from Bangladesh, actually had fathered a black child; recorded phone messages, or robo-calls, spreading rumors that McCain\u2019s wife, Cindy, who had once been addicted to prescription painkillers, was a junkie; and lies, propagated by an obscure group of Vietnam veterans, suggesting that McCain had become a traitor while serving in Vietnam. \n \n McCain\u2019s response was decisive: he pulled from television his negative advertisements, and announced to supporters, \u201cIf we don\u2019t prevail, my friends, we know that we have taken the honorable way.\u201d On the evening of the primary, McCain and his family watched the returns in a hotel suite in Charleston. As the polls came in, showing that he had lost by more than ten points, Cindy wept. \u201cHow could they believe all that about you?\u201d she said of the public. \n \n McCain, after embracing his wife and children, headed down to a ballroom to deliver his concession speech. \u201cI will not take the low road to the highest office in this land,\u201d he said. \u201cI want the Presidency in the best way\u2014not the worst way. The American people deserve to be treated with respect by those who seek to lead the nation. And I promise you: you will have my respect until my last day on earth. The greatest blessing of my life was to have been born an American, and I will never . . . dishonor the nation I love or myself by letting ambition overcome principle. Never. Never. Never.\u201d \n \n In the final weeks of the 2008 campaign, it became clear that John McCain might lose more than the Presidency. On October 6th, slipping steeply in the polls, he held a rally in Albuquerque. Rather than speak off the cuff, as he preferred, he kept his eyes on a teleprompter. During the 2000 race, McCain was known as the \u201chappy warrior,\u201d but now his tone was harsh. Angrily waving a finger, McCain portrayed his Democratic opponent, Barack Obama, as a shadowy figure who never seemed to reveal his true identity. McCain noted that Obama\u2019s campaign recently had to \u201creturn thirty-three thousand dollars in illegal foreign funds from Palestinian donors.\u201d McCain urged the audience to wonder, \u201cWho is the real Barack Obama?\u201d \n \n Before he even finished the speech, he and his aides had begun their now notorious campaign\u2014sometimes in public, sometimes sub rosa\u2014to supply insinuating answers to this question. Ads appeared accusing Obama, who had served on the boards of two charities with William Ayers, a founder of the Weather Underground, of being allied with a \u201cterrorist.\u201d Voters received flyers featuring a mug shot of Ayers and the words \u201cTerrorist. Radical. Friend of Obama.\u201d Then came the same kind of robo-calls that had savaged McCain in 2000, and that he had once denounced as messages of \u201chate.\u201d McCain even hired one of the same firms that Bush used in 2000. The messages warned, among other things, that Obama had tried to stop doctors from caring \u201cfor babies born alive after surviving attempted abortions.\u201d Meanwhile, McCain\u2019s running mate, Sarah Palin, charged that Obama was \u201cpalling around with terrorists.\u201d Other surrogates claimed that Obama was \u201canti-American,\u201d a \u201cguy of the street\u201d who \u201cused cocaine,\u201d and had \u201cfriends that bombed the Pentagon.\u201d According to Newsweek, Michelle Obama asked an aide, \u201cWhy would they try to make people hate us?\u201d \n \n Early on, McCain vowed that he wanted \u201cthe most positive kind of campaign.\u201d But even though he sometimes seemed uncomfortable, shifting in his chair or looking away from the camera, he was at the heart of those personal attacks\u2014demanding that Obama confess his relationship to a \u201cwashed-up terrorist,\u201d and proclaiming that Obama would \u201close a war in order to win a political campaign.\u201d \n \n As the rallies of McCain and Palin grew angrier\u2014at the mention of Obama\u2019s name, supporters yelled \u201cTraitor!,\u201d \u201cKill him!,\u201d and \u201cOff with his head!\u201d\u2014McCain seemed startled by what he had helped unleash. When, at one rally, a woman called Obama an untrustworthy \u201cArab,\u201d McCain turned ashen and stammered, \u201cNo, Ma\u2019am. He\u2019s a decent family man.\u201d Afterward, Ray LaHood, a Republican congressman from Illinois, who earlier had condemned the campaign\u2019s inflammatory rhetoric, told me, \u201cThat\u2019s the John McCain I know.\u201d \n \n Obama and his supporters decried McCain\u2019s tactics. Yet some of the strongest criticism came from people whom McCain revered or who had long revered him. And it was not merely about strategy\u2014the backbiting that always consumes losing campaigns. It was about the very nature of John McCain. In their eyes, at least, their hero was losing not only an election but his reputation\u2014or, as one prominent backer put it, \u201chis soul.\u201d \n \n William G. Milliken, a moderate three-term Republican governor of Michigan, was part of the unusual coalition that had made McCain an almost singular figure in American politics. Although for most of his career McCain\u2019s voting record was consistently conservative, he was far more popular with centrist Republicans, independents, and many Democrats than he was with the Party\u2019s base. His appeal was rooted less in ideology than in character: he presented himself as a figure who would never pander or betray his convictions. When he fell short of his principles, as in the 1989 Keating Five scandal\u2014the Senate Ethics Committee found that he \u201cexercised poor judgment\u201d in helping a major donor\u2014his willingness to lacerate himself in public only reinforced this impression for many. ||||| George W. Bush\u2019s bombastic return to the world stage has reminded me of my favourite Bush anecdote, which for various reasons we couldn\u2019t publish at the time. Some of the witnesses still dine out on it. \n \n The venue was the Oval Office. A group of British dignitaries, including Gordon Brown, were paying a visit. It was at the height of the 2008 presidential election campaign, not long after Bush publicly endorsed John McCain as his successor. \n \n Naturally the election came up in conversation. Trying to be even-handed and polite, the Brits said something diplomatic about McCain\u2019s campaign, expecting Bush to express some warm words of support for the Republican candidate. \n \n Not a chance. \u201cI probably won\u2019t even vote for the guy,\u201d Bush told the group, according to two people present.\u201cI had to endorse him. But I\u2019d have endorsed Obama if they\u2019d asked me.\u201d \n \n Endorse Obama? Cue dumbfounded look from British officials, followed by some awkward remarks about the Washington weather. Even Gordon Brown\u2019s poker face gave way to a flash of astonishment. \n \n To be fair, this wasn\u2019t completely unexpected. The degree of enmity between Bush and McCain \u2014 particularly following their legendarily dirty fight in the 2000 South Carolina primary \u2014 is hard to exaggerate. \n \n Indeed Bush is far from kind to McCain in the parts of his new book that relate his \u201ccomplex relationship\u201d with the Arizona senator. I\u2019ve yet to see a copy, so I don\u2019t know whether he mentions how he voted. But it might be worth asking. He was certainly wavering.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 George Bush's stop-the-presses revelations just won't stop, though the latest comes by way of a dusty anecdote that's finally seeing the light of day. Alex Barker, writing for the Financial Times reveals that in an Oval Office meeting with Gordon Brown and other British dignitaries during the 2008 campaign season, John McCain came up in conversation. Bush reportedly told the group (according to two who were there): \"I probably won\u2019t even vote for the guy. I had to endorse him. But I\u2019d have endorsed Obama if they\u2019d asked me.\" Barker recounts the \"flash of astonishment\" that befell the British crew, but says the alleged comments weren't \"completely unexpected,\" considering the lack of love between Bush and McCain (he points to their dirty fight in the 2000 South Carolina primary).",

I get pples opinion, but they are not mine.\u201d \n \n In another message, Mango said she had been to all of her son\u2019s modeling shoots and was with him when he modeled the hoodie in question. \n \n \u201cEveryone is entitled to their opinion about this,\u201d Mango wrote. \u201c \u2026 I really don\u2019t understand but not coz am choosing not to but because it\u2019s not my way of thinking, sorry.\u201d \n \n H&M apologized for the ad on Monday. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re deeply sorry that the picture was taken, and we also regret the actual print,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cTherefore, we\u2019ve not only removed the image from our channels, but also the garment from our product offering.\u201d \n \n The statement continued: \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that our routines haven\u2019t been followed properly. This is without any doubt. We\u2019ll thoroughly investigate why this happened to prevent this type of mistake from happening again.\u201d \n \n NBA megastar LeBron James and Manchester United forward Romelu Lukaku are among the many who spoke out against the ad. \n \n \u201cWe as African Americans will always have to break barriers, prove people wrong and work even harder to prove we belong but guess what, that\u2019s what we love because the benefits at the end of the road are so beautiful!\u201d James wrote in a post showing the boy wearing a crown accompanied by the words \u201cKing of the World.\u201d ||||| The parents of the young black model who posed in a H&M hoodie with the word \u201cmonkey\u201d on it say they don\u2019t believe the photograph was intended to be racist. \n \n The image of five-year-old Liam Mango, a Swedish child model, wearing a green hoodie that reads \u201cCoolest Monkey in the Jungle\u201d went viral last week and caused outrage, with the likes of The Weeknd, Diddy and LeBron James criticizing H&M for the seemingly tone-deaf campaign and social media users deeming it racist. H&M has since apologized for using the photograph. \n \n On Monday, Liam\u2019s parents, Terry Mango and Frank Odhiambo, addressed the controversy on the U.K.\u2019s This Morning program on ITV. \n \n \u201cI wouldn\u2019t see such a connection to anything other than my son modeling a shirt,\u201d said Mrs. Mango, speaking about the racial connotations of the advertisement. \u201cWith the furore going on, you look back and wonder, if you had noticed it, what would be my initial response to it?\u201d \n \n Mango went on to say that she doesn\u2019t feel the controversy is an overreaction, however, and supported people speaking out about racism\u2014though she doesn\u2019t necessarily share the same opinion in this instance. \n \n \u201cEverybody should act differently based on their opinions of what racism is,\u201d said the boy\u2019s mother. \u201cI know what racism is\u2014I\u2019ve had racist remarks directed to me. I\u2019ve been called \u2018monkey\u2019 on a cruise ship and my reaction is the same as the world is reacting right now.\u201d \n \n But, said Mango, \u201cTo put the T-shirt and the word \u2018monkey\u2019 with racism, maybe that is not my way of looking at it. I\u2019m just looking at Liam, a black, young boy, modeling a T-shirt that has \u2018monkey\u2019 on it. I think everyone should respect different opinions on racism.\u201d \n \n Young Liam\u2019s parents say their son loves modeling and was contracted to the H&M campaign through a modeling agency in Stockholm. Mango or Odhiambo usually accompany Liam to his shoots and told the program they did not recall Liam posing in the hoodie in question until the image surfaced online and caused uproar last week. \n \n Odhiambo said he worried about his family\u2019s safety after the story received worldwide press attention. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that people should understand we have a son, we have other children in the home, and we have an obligation to protect our children,\u201d said the boy\u2019s father. \n \n The boy\u2019s mother said young Liam isn\u2019t aware of the racism controversy surrounding the image but understood that he had gained some infamy. \u201cHe\u2019s aware he\u2019s a superstar. He\u2019s seen images online. He believes people love him for his modeling job, and he\u2019s cool, and [for] his confidence in his job,\u201d said Mango. ||||| Surely the year of Sociopathic Baby Men, 2017 was also the year of pathetic apologies. From random Jay-Z quotes to omitting the actual words \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d and implying sexual harassment is fun, misogynistic men (and their lawyers) demonstrated a profound inability to discern between self-absorption and remorse. \n \n And as 2018 began, it appeared the trend would continue. On Jan. 8, H&M came under fire after a product shot on the Swedish fast-fashion brand\u2019s UK site used a black child to sell a hoodie that says \u201ccoolest monkey in the jungle.\u201d \n \n As Marc Bain explained in Quartz, the image was seen as disgracefully racist. Singer and songwriter The Weeknd, who has collaborated with H&M on a fashion line tweeted that he was \u201cshocked and embarrassed\u201d will no longer work with the company. Drummer and producer Questlove used an Instagram post to write, \u201call this tells me about @HM is that the seats in the boardroom lack something\u2026wanna take a guess?\u201d Others questioned whether the advertisement was an embarrassing instance of cultural ignorance, given how the racial history of Sweden differs from that of the US. \n \n H&M says sorry, round one \n \n Responding to the internet\u2019s rage, H&M swiftly apologized\u2014kind of. \n \n \u201cWe sincerely apologize for offending people with this image of a printed hooded top,\u201d H&M\u2019s PR representative said in a statement sent to Bain. \u201cThe image has been removed from all online channels and the product will not be for sale in the United States.\u201d \n \n Many people were not satisfied with this apology\u2014with good reason. The hoodie was still being sold on its UK site, Business Insider reported. What\u2019s more, this initial apology commits one of the most egregious apology errors: Instead of sincerely apologizing for creating and promoting an offensive product, H&M apologized for \u201coffending people with this image.\u201d The subtle difference between saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry for what I did\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m sorry if you feel badly\u201d is profound. \n \n As Nicole McCance, a Toronto-based relationship psychologist who works with couples and families, tells Quartz, \u201cEven if they\u2019re well intentioned, saying phrases like \u2018I\u2019m sorry if you feel like I was mean\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m sorry if you feel angry,\u2019 will not work because they minimize the other person\u2019s feelings and experience.\u201d \n \n Instead, McCance advises following \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d with genuine expressions of remorse, and phrases like \u201cI can imagine you\u2019re so disappointed.\u201d Most important, make sure \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d includes clear and specific examples of what, exactly, you are sorry for. \n \n \u201cSaying \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 alone is fairly empty. It\u2019s just a hollow statement that doesn\u2019t do much for the giver or the receiver of the apology,\u201d Joanne Lescher, a certified non-violent communication facilitator, tells Quartz. \u201cIf you are really sorry, maybe it\u2019s because you regret your actions or words, because you\u2019ve seen how whatever you said or did impacted the other person. So you should continue your apology by saying something like, \u2018I regret that I said X because I see how deeply it impacted you, and how hurt you are by my words, and that wasn\u2019t my intention.\u201d Apologizing with your regret is deeper and richer than \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d because it shows that you see how much you hurt the other person, she says. \n \n While removing the hoodie from the US site is a step in the right direction, H&M\u2019s first apology essentially equates to: \u201cUgh, we\u2019ll take it down, but we don\u2019t regret it.\u201d \n \n H&M says sorry, round two \n \n No statement can reverse H&M\u2019s ill-informed advertisement. However, as public figures and companies continue to issue flailing, seemingly fake remorse, the progress H&M demonstrated in their second apology is worth learning from. \n \n Yesterday (Jan. 10), H&M sent that longer apology to its media list, opening with the stark statement: \u201cOur position is simple and unequivocal\u2014we have got this wrong and we are deeply sorry.\u201d After explaining its full commitment to addressing societal issues such as diversity and environmental protection, H&M admitted \u201cwe clearly haven\u2019t come far enough. We agree with all the criticism that this has generated\u2014we have got this wrong and we agree that, even if unintentional, passive or casual racism needs to be eradicated wherever it exists.\u201d \n \n This second pass, which can be read in full below, models the most essential element of an apology: taking full responsibility for your actions, and not attempting to justify the ways in which your wrongs may have been right. \u201cFirst and foremost, it\u2019s really important to avoid explaining the reasons behind what you did,\u201d McCance tells Quartz. \u201cThere are always reasons behind behavior, but laying out these reasons can come across as excuses. If you do this, the other person will feel like you aren\u2019t sincere and don\u2019t get it.\u201d \n \n H&M also put action behind their words, removing the hoodie from sale everywhere and committing to recycling the remaining stock. \u201cIf the apology doesn\u2019t have that following piece of \u2018what I want to do differently,\u2019 then the person may not ever change their behavior,\u201d Lescher says. \u201cUntil you take responsibility for your behavior, and create a plan of action on how to improve, most of us fall back into old patterns.\u201d \n \n H&M\u2019s second apology, in full \n \n To all customers, staff, media, stakeholders, partners, suppliers, friends and critics. \n \n We would like to put on record our position in relation to the image and promotion of a children\u2019s sweater, and the ensuing response and criticism. \n \n Our position is simple and unequivocal\u2014we have got this wrong and we are deeply sorry. \n \n H&M is fully committed to playing its part in addressing society\u2019s issues and problems, whether it\u2019s diversity, working conditions or environmental protection\u2014and many others. Our standards are high and we feel that we have made real progress over the years in playing our part in promoting diversity and inclusion. But we clearly haven\u2019t come far enough. \n \n We agree with all the criticism that this has generated\u2014we have got this wrong and we agree that, even if unintentional, passive or casual racism needs to be eradicated wherever it exists. We appreciate the support of those who have seen that our product and promotion were not intended to cause offence but, as a global brand, we have a responsibility to be aware of and attuned to all racial and cultural sensitivities\u2014and we have not lived up to this responsibility this time. \n \n This incident is accidental in nature, but this doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t take it extremely seriously or understand the upset and discomfort it has caused. \n \n We have taken down the image and we have removed the garment in question from sale. It will be recycled. \n \n We will now be doing everything we possibly can to prevent this from happening again in future. \n \n Racism and bias in any shape or form, conscious or unconscious, deliberate or accidental, are simply unacceptable and need to be eradicated from society. In this instance we have not been sensitive enough to this agenda. \n \n Please accept our humble apologies. \n \n Read next: This is how to apologize like you really mean it ||||| The parents of the boy at the centre of the \u201cracist\u201d H&M hoodie storm have spoken out about the huge reaction the clothing brand as well as the family have received. \n \n Liam Mango was pictured in a hoodie on the H&M website which read \u2018coolest monkey in the jungle.\u2019 \n \n However after the image was posted online, the company faced a huge backlash, with members of the public calling the decision to use a black child to model the hoodie \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cunacceptable.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \n H&M swiftly apologised and Liam\u2019s parents have now revealed they never saw the hoodie the same way as many members of the public. \n \n Speaking on This Morning from Stockholm, Sweden, mother Terry and father Frank explained they didn\u2019t even know about the hoodie before the internet erupted. \n \n But Terry said even if she\u2019d seen the slogan before, she doesn\u2019t think that would have rung alarm bells for her. \n \n \u201cI wouldn\u2019t see such a connection to anything other than my son modelling a shirt,\u201d Terry explained. \n \n \u201cUntil the controversy now, with the whole furore that is going on, then you kind of look back and wonder if you had noticed it, what would be our, or my, initial response to it.\u201d \n \n But Terry explained she doesn\u2019t believe the furore has necessarily been unjust. \n \n \u201cIt is not an overreaction when it comes to racism, everyone should act differently based on their opinions of what racism is,\u201d she said, explaining that she\u2019s faced racism and even been called a \u2018monkey\u2019 herself. \n \n \u201cTo put the T-shirt and the word \u2018monkey\u2019 with racism, maybe that is not my way of looking at it,\u201d Terry added. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m just looking at Liam, a black young boy, modeling a T-shirt that has the word \u2018monkey\u2019 on it. \n \n \u201cEverybody should respect different opinions based on racism.\u201d \n \n (This Morning) \n \n The family have had to move out of their home, and Frank explained that they no longer have their \u201cnormal family life.\u201d \n \n \u201cAs much as people have gotten involved in this, for me it\u2019s very important that people understand that me and Teresa, we have a son, we have other children in the home that we are raising, and we have an obligation to protect our children,\u201d he said. \n \n And the parents added that Liam doesn\u2019t really understand the big fuss around him \n \n \u201cHe\u2019s aware he\u2019s a superstar and people love him,\u201d Terry said. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Terry Mango: \"Does the shirt, to me, speak racism?

I know racism exists, but does the shirt to me speak racism? No it doesn't,\" she told BBC Outside Source. \n \n Though Mrs Mango has been a victim of racism and acknowledges it's a huge problem, she's been attacked by other black people for not condemning H&M. \n \n \"I [am] a sell out to them, I [am] an embarrassment to the black and African-American people. I sold my son for money,\" she told BBC Outside Source. \n \n The family have moved out of their house in Stockholm following \"security concerns\" Mrs Mango added. \n \n Though she did not elaborate on the safety reasons, Mrs Mango said the attacks on H&M stores in and around Johannesburg were one reason for the move. \n \n The protests, which took place on Saturday, were organised by the radical Economic Freedom Fighters' party (EFF). \n \n Video footage showed protesters trashing displays, kicking over clothes rails and shoving mannequins while police used rubber bullets to disperse them. \n \n Theirs was not the only protest. \n \n Amid calls for a global boycott of H&M, musicians The Weeknd and G-Eazy have cut ties with the company, with the former saying the advert made him feel \"shocked and embarrassed\". \n \n Despite the furore, Liam Mango remains oblivious. \n \n \"He has no idea what's going on, he's only five...

    "document": "Getty Images Elon Musk \n \n A statement from Tesla\u2019s board members on Wednesday raises further questions following the shock tweet from Elon Musk that he wants to take the auto maker private. \n \n The brief news release from Tesla board members\u2014Brad Buss, Robyn Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis, Antonio Gracias, Linda Johnson Rice, and James Murdoch\u2014consisted of three sentences: \n \n Last week, Elon opened a discussion with the board about taking the company private. This included discussion as to how being private could better serve Tesla\u2019s long-term interests, and also addressed the funding for this to occur. The board has met several times over the last week and is taking the appropriate next steps to evaluate this. \n \n Two board members, venture capital investor Steve Jurvetson as well as Musk\u2019s brother, Kimbal Musk, didn\u2019t sign on to the statement. (Jurvetson has taken leave from Tesla after being accused of sexual harassment.) \n \n The statement from members of Tesla Inc.\u2019s TSLA, +5.77% board does show there was a discussion of how he could fund such a bid. But the board\u2019s statement leaves open the crucial question of whether they were satisfied that\u2014as Musk\u2019s surprise tweet put it\u2014he had enough backing to assert \u201cfunding secured.\u201d \n \n At $420 a share, the price at which Musk tweeted he was considering setting the bid, the deal would be valued at $72 billion before debt. \n \n Related: A Tesla buyout would be the largest in history\u2014by a wide margin \n \n Tesla shares were down more than 1% early Wednesday, after surging by about 11% on Tuesday. The electric-car maker\u2019s stock has climbed by 21% so far this year. By comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +3.29% is set for a year-to-date gain of 3.5%, the S&P 500 index SPX, +3.43% is on track for a return of 6.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +4.26% has advanced by more than 14% so far this year, according to FactSet data. Tesla\u2019s run-up comes despite the company being a consistent target of investors aiming to short the its stock, or bet against Tesla\u2019s shares rising. \n \n Another crucial question raised by the statement is the timing. \u201cLast week\u201d predates Tesla\u2019s filing on Monday of its 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which didn\u2019t mention such discussions. \n \n News of a takeover would certainly be considered material, yet it wasn\u2019t disclosed until Musk\u2019s tweet on Tuesday. \n \n Another question is what the \u201cappropriate next steps\u201d are, though that\u2019s probably the imminent formation of a committee to evaluate the bid. \n \n What was left out of the statement also is worth considering. For instance, there was no indication that the board was satisfied with either Musk\u2019s method or timing for announcing the approach, though they didn\u2019t rebuke him, either. \n \n Murdoch also sits on the board of News Corp., which owns MarketWatch, the publisher of this report. \n \n Related: Did Elon Musk break any laws with his going-private tweet? \n \n Want news about Europe delivered to your inbox?

They did not include Mr Musk, his brother Kimbal Musk, and Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist. \n \n 'Irregular' announcement \n \n The board statement came amid questions about how Mr Musk opted to disclose the possible de-listing to investors. \n \n While companies are allowed to make announcements via social media, typically they also make a simultaneous regulatory filing, said Andrew M Calamari, a partner at the law firm Finn Dixon & Herling and former director of the New York office of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US market regulator. \n \n \"Just in terms of the style of this, it strikes me as very irregular,\" Mr Calamari said. \n \n \"It also raises questions about his intent,\" he added. \"Was he in earnest in what he's saying, or does he have some other motive\" like influencing the stock price. \n \n Tesla shares reached a peak of $368 after Mr Musk's tweets on Tuesday, before trading on the stock market was halted. \n \n Trades resumed later that afternoon, after the company published an email from Mr Musk to employees elaborating on the plans. \n \n Tesla shares surged close to their all-time high of $385, which they touched almost a year ago, but fluctuated on Wednesday after the board members issued their statement. \n \n 'Wild swings' \n \n In the staff memo, Mr Musk explained why he wanted to take the company private. \n \n \"As a public company, we are subject to wild swings in our stock price that can be a major distraction for everyone working at Tesla, all of whom are shareholders,\" he wrote. \n \n \"Being public also subjects us to the quarterly earnings cycle that puts enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long term,\" he wrote. \n \n He added that the company was \"the most shorted stock in the history of the stock market\" - a trading strategy which assumes share prices will fall - so \"being public means that there are large numbers of people who have the incentive to attack the company\". \n \n Those traders are likely to have lost money when the share price rose on the announcement about a delisting. \n \n Questions continue \n \n Mr Musk already owns 20% of the company. He said his intention in taking the company private was not to increase his personal holding and his plan would give existing investors the option to retain their shares. \n \n Regulators are likely to be interested in what evidence exists - such as agreements with investors or banks - for Mr Musk's claim that funding was \"secured\", Mr Calamari said. \n \n The Securities and Exchange Commission, the US market regulator, has inquired about the issue, the Wall Street Journal reported. \n \n The structure of the deal also remains ambiguous, said Adam C Pritchard, professor of securities law at the University of Michigan. \n \n If more than 2,000 investors opt to retain their shares, then the firm would be subject to the disclosure rules of a public company, he added. \n \n \"Intuitively it doesn't make sense because it would still be a public entity, and the public entity status is what is apparently objectionable to Musk,\" Mr Pritchard said. \n \n Steven Kaplan, a University of Chicago professor who researches private equity, said it would be difficult for Mr Musk to raise the necessary finance when Tesla has still not made a profit. \n \n \"The company is cash-flow negative. How do you use any debt on a company that is cash-flow negative?\" he said.",

That growth, however, has been based in a large part on Facebook's use of Yahoo's patented technology.\" \n \n The complaint also quotes Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg as acknowledging that \"getting there first is not what it's all about.\" Further on, it states, \"Facebook's entire social network model, which allows users to create profiles for and connect with, among other things, persons and businesses, is based on Yahoo's patented social networking technology.\" \n \n Yahoo's suit, which seeks unspecified damages, comes at an awkward time for Facebook. The social networking giant is expected to launch an IPO in May to raise $5 billion. Yahoo, meanwhile, risks being seen as desperate in engaging in patent trolling as its revenues and market share continue to slip. \n \n The suit comes after Yahoo and Facebook were apparently unable to work out an agreement over the issue. Yahoo was in talks with Facebook over its patent claims last month, according to a report in The New York Times. At the time, Yahoo was threatening a lawsuit if Facebook didn't pay licensing fees, according to the report. \n \n Image courtesy of Flickr, Eric Hayes \n \n Complaint for Patent Infringement ||||| The Yahoo!

Yahoo Inc sued Facebook Inc on Monday over 10 patents that include methods and systems for advertising on the... \n \n SAN FRANCISCO Yahoo Inc sued Facebook Inc over 10 patents that include methods and systems for advertising on the Web, opening the first major legal battle among big technology companies in social media. \n \n The lawsuit, filed in a San Jose, California federal court on Monday, marks a major escalation of patent litigation that has already swept up the smartphone and tablet sectors and high-tech stalwarts such as Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp and Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. \n \n Yahoo's patent lawsuit follows Facebook's announcement of plans for an initial public offering that could value the company at about $100 billion. \n \n Facebook spokesman Jonathan Thaw said Facebook learned of the lawsuit through the media. \n \n \"We're disappointed that Yahoo, a longtime business partner of Facebook and a company that has substantially benefited from its association with Facebook, has decided to resort to litigation,\" he said. \n \n In an emailed statement, Yahoo said it is confident it will prevail. \n \n \"Unfortunately, the matter with Facebook remains unresolved and we are compelled to seek redress in federal court,\" the company said in a statement. \n \n Yahoo, one of the Web's pioneering companies, has seen its revenues decline in recent years at a time when rivals such as Facebook and Google have thrived. In January, Yahoo appointed former PayPal President Scott Thompson as its new chief executive, replacing Carol Bartz, who was fired in September. \n \n Yahoo said late last month it was seeking licensing fees from Facebook over its patents and that other companies have already agreed to such licensing deals. \n \n IPO COMPANIES VULNERABLE \n \n Colleen Chien, a professor at Santa Clara Law in Silicon Valley, said companies are usually more vulnerable to patent suits when they are in the IPO process. \n \n \"As a general proposition, when a company is about to go public, the last thing it needs is to get involved in a knock-down, drag out litigation fight,\" Chien said. \n \n \"So that might make Facebook more willing to resolve its differences with Yahoo.\" \n \n Yahoo has used similar timing to its advantage in the past. Google agreed to issue shares to Yahoo nine days before Google went public in 2004 in exchange for a license to Yahoo's patents. Google later took a $201 million non-cash charge related to the transaction. \n \n In deciding to sue Facebook, Yahoo has retained the same law firm, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, used by Google and other manufacturers in many Android-related smartphone patent cases. Google is a player in social media with its Google+ service. \n \n Quinn Emanuel also counts social gaming service Zynga Inc as a client, according to the law firm's website. \n \n Yahoo has not said whether it will bring patent claims against other social networking companies and a Google spokesman declined to comment on Quinn Emanuel's involvement. Zynga also declined to comment. \n \n In the lawsuit, Yahoo says Facebook was considered \"one of the worst performing sites for advertising\" prior to adapting Yahoo's ideas. \n \n \"Mr. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder and CEO, has conceded that the design of Facebook is not novel and is based on the ideas of others,\" the lawsuit said. \n \n ONLINE ADVERTISING \n \n Only two of the 10 patents at issue are directly related to social networking technology. Most focus on online advertising, including methods for preventing \"click fraud,\" as well as privacy and technology for customizing the information users see on a Web page. \n \n \"If what Yahoo is saying is literally true, then it seems like a lot of companies would be liable,\" said Shubha Ghosh, a professor who specializes in intellectual property at The University of Wisconsin Law School. But he added, much would depend on whether a judge defines the patents broadly or narrowly. \n \n Several social networking companies, including Facebook, have seen an uptick in patent claims asserted against them as they move through the IPO process. \n \n However, most of those lawsuits have been filed by patent aggregators that buy up intellectual property to squeeze value from it via licensing deals and none by a large tech company such as Yahoo. \n \n The lawsuit is a change for Yahoo because the company has never initiated offensive patent litigation against such a large publicly traded company, according to a search of federal court dockets on legal database Westlaw, a Thomson Reuters unit. \n \n A classic defense for companies targeted with patent claims is to threaten a countersuit using its own patents. But Yahoo possesses far more patents than Facebook. According to a U.S. government database, Yahoo has over 3,300 patents and published patent applications, while Facebook has 160. \n \n The case in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California is Yahoo Inc. v.

The National Weather Service issued gale and storm warnings for the lakes through Wednesday. ||||| Hurricane Sandy, one of the largest storms ever to hit the East Coast, pummeled Massachusetts on Monday with punishing winds and dangerously high seas, flooding some coastal areas, and cutting power to hundreds of thousands of customers. \n \n Utility companies that service the state at one point reported nearly 380,000 customers without power on Monday. That number had fallen to about 310,000 as of 3:15 a.m. on Tuesday. \n \n The enormous storm, gaining speed as it roared north across the Atlantic, brought steady rain and sustained winds of 35 miles per hour through much of the day, with gusts nearly twice that strong. \n \n Advertisement - Continue Reading Below \n \n Although Sandy\u2019s landfall was in southern New Jersey, it cut a destructive path nearly a thousand miles wide, causing massive disruptions throughout the Northeast. It was classified as a post-tropical cyclone, rather than a hurricane, by the time it hit the New Jersey coast at around 8 p.m., the weather service reported. \n \n In Massachusetts, heavy winds toppled trees and power lines, closing roads and causing more power outages throughout the day. Heavy surf pounded the coast, forcing evacuations in some low-lying areas in advance of the evening high tide, when storm surges were expected to exceed 6 feet. \n \n \u201cAll of our shoreline could be affected,\u201d said Brian Legendre, fire chief in Westport, a coastal town next to Fall River. \n \n Utilities warned that because of the storm\u2019s strength and duration, power outages could last a few days. The high winds would make it too dangerous for some repairs to occur, Governor Deval Patrick said in an evening press conference. Utilities would be working through the night to restore power where they can, he said. \n \n State officials said there were no reports of any serious injuries. \n \n David Procopio, a State Police spokesman, said that troopers were investigating a car crash that claimed the life of a man on Route 128 in Peabody at about 6:25 p.m., and that speed and weather were potential factors. \n \n The powerful late-season storm, which killed nearly 70 people in the Caribbean, brought the Bay State to a near-standstill. As most people hunkered at home, major roads were half-empty, public transit shut down, and schools, malls, and businesses were closed. \n \n Amtrak canceled its service along the Northeast Corridor through Tuesday, and several bus lines canceled service through Tuesday as well. At Logan International Airport, more than 900 flights were canceled on Monday, and several airlines had canceled flights scheduled for Tuesday. \n \n Logan advised travelers to check with their airlines on the status of their flights before coming to the airport on Tuesday. \n \n The MBTA stopped running shortly after 2 p.m. amid mounting reports of downed wires and branches and concerns that flooding would make parts of the system impassible. \n \n \u201cShutting down public transit is never ideal. But under the circumstances, the safety of our customers and our employees is paramount,\u201d said Richard Davey, the state\u2019s transportation secretary. \n \n The closing was announced at 10 a.m., prompting a rush for the final trains. By noon, South Station was at rush-hour bustle as riders headed home. \n \n Davey said he hoped service would resume Tuesday morning but that crews needed time to survey the damage. By mid-afternoon, at least 15 trees or large branches had fallen on rail lines. \n \n \u201cWe hope to run full service for tomorrow morning,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThat would be our goal. But it is not guaranteed.\u2019\u2019 \n \n An MBTA spokesman said late Monday night that service would resume Tuesday morning. Subways will resume regularly scheduled service, said Joe Pesaturo, except that shuttle buses will replace trains on the D Line between Riverside and Reservoir stations. \n \n Commuter rail service was expected to resume with delays and with the suspension of the Providence/Stoughton Line between Mansfield and Wickford Junction. Pesaturo encouraged commuters to check the authority\u2019s website at MBTA.com for updates. \n \n Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino said schools and city offices would be open Tuesday. \n \n Winds were expected to wane overnight, but a coastal flood warning was in effect until 1 p.m. Tuesday. \n \n As Monday\u2019s high tide approached under a full moon, Legendre warned that the \u201cworst is yet to come.\u201d \n \n Forecasters warned that the state\u2019s southern coast from Westport to Fairhaven might experience severe flooding, potentially more damaging than Hurricane Bob in 1991. Some 1,300 National Guard soldiers were deployed, mostly to the eastern and southern coasts. \n \n As Sandy moved toward the coast, the Category 1 hurricane packed winds up to 90 miles per hour, and forecasters said it could stand as the largest hurricane in New England history. Its air pressure \u2014 an indicator of the storm\u2019s power \u2014 was the lowest ever recorded in the area. \n \n \u201cThe lower the pressure, the more powerful the hurricane,\u201d said Charlie Foley, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Taunton. \n \n Wind gusts of more than 60 miles per hour were reported in Brookline, Milton, Lawrence, Barnstable, Falmouth, and Fairhaven on Monday afternoon. Winds around 81 miles per hour were reported in Wellfleet just after 2 p.m., and a buoy off Cuttyhunk recorded a gust of 83 miles per hour. \n \n By about 11 p.m. on Monday, the effects of Sandy were beginning to taper off in the state, Weather Service meteorologist Stephanie Dunten said. \n \n The storm was located just south of Lancaster, Pa., as of 2 a.m. on Tuesday, the weather service said. \n \n In Massachusetts, the highest winds were mainly seen across Cape Cod, Dunten said, and wind gusts at Fort Independence, Hyannis Park, and East Falmouth were also in the 70 mile-an-hour range. \n \n Light showers are expected Tuesday with winds gusting up to 20 miles per hour, and a coastal flood warning was still in effect late Monday until conditions could be evaluated after high tide, Dunten said. \n \n The state of emergency declared by Patrick also remained in effect late Monday and will be lifted in the coming days, officials said. \n \n According to the Weather Service, Barnstable, Braintree, and Fairhaven saw heavy coastal flooding on Monday. While the worst of it has passed, minor to moderate coastal flooding is excepted Tuesday morning in areas including Scituate, Revere, and Newburyport, the Weather Service said. \n \n In Waltham, about 25 families were forced to leave their homes when part of the roof was blown from two condominium buildings. One of the roofs was waving back and forth in the wind Monday night, and, at times, hanging about 10 feet over the edge of the building. Scraps of metal and wood littered the ground. \n \n Despite the high winds, officials said the storm had not caused overwhelming damage. \n \n In New Bedford, dozens of people took refuge at emergency shelters. Andrew DiIanni, 38, and Steve Correia, 28, said they have been living under a bridge near the downtown area. They initially tried to ride out the storm with a barrier of tarps. But by noon, the wind became too strong, and they called police for help. \n \n \u201cThey were whipped in half, the wind was so strong,\u201d DiIanni said of the tarps. \n \n Just over a hundred people sought shelter in the state. \n \n In Cambridge, a tree fell on the home of Chip and Susan Strang at 60 Fresh Pond Parkway, shattering windows, crushing a fence, and protruding into the house from the roof and front wall. \n \n It\u2019s amazing how it shot in,\u201d Chip Strang said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it did that.\u201d \n \n Outside 20 Howard St., a tree knocked down power lines and crushed the roof of a parked Nissan. \n \n As the initial bands of rain and wind generated by the hurricane arrived on Cape Cod, life proceeded, albeit at a curtailed pace. And curiosity was at a premium, with storm watchers gathering along the shore. \n \n At Bagels and Beyond in West Yarmouth, customers trickled in, a mix of emergency workers and people liberated from work for the day because of Sandy. Owner Julie Moran was there in the morning \u2014 but hoping to close a bit earlier than the normal closing hour of 2 p.m. \n \n Siblings Kris and Katelyn Reddy and friend Lori Bois swung by the bagel shop Monday morning. \n \n \u201cNone of us had work today,\u201d said Bois, who cleans houses. \u201cBasically, we\u2019re probably going to go home now and not leave.\u201d \n \n Sandy didn\u2019t scare Jen and Jon Coil, a married couple staying at the hotel, who traveled from Philadelphia to Salem on Sunday. \n \n \u201cWhat difference does it make if the hurricane hits us in Philadelphia or Salem?\u201d asked Jen, 30, a paralegal, making her first visit to Salem. \u201cI do wish more things were open today. We were looking forward to visiting some museums.\u201d \n \n In Scituate, as midnight \u2014 and high tide \u2014 approached, the angry sea still churned, though not as ferociously as earlier in the day. The wind was still announcing itself, just not as loudly. And the clouds had begun to part, revealing a full moon. ||||| Hurricane Sandy created numerous closings and cancellations to start the week, but most will be restored beginning Wednesday.

If so, share your images and footage with CNN iReport, but please stay safe. \n \n (CNN) -- Though no longer a hurricane, \"post-tropical\" superstorm Sandy packed a hurricane-sized punch as it slammed into the Jersey Shore on Monday, killing at least 11 people from West Virginia to North Carolina and Connecticut. \n \n Sandy whipped torrents of water over the streets of Atlantic City, stretching for blocks inland and ripping up part of the vacation spot's fabled boardwalk. The storm surge set records in Lower Manhattan, where flooded substations caused a widespread power outage. It swamped beachfronts on both sides of Long Island Sound and delivered hurricane-force winds from Virginia to Cape Cod as it came ashore. \n \n Sandy's wrath also prompted the evacuation of about 200 patients at NYU Langone Medical Center. \n \n \"We are having intermittent telephone access issues, and for this reason the receiving hospital will notify the families of their arrival,\" spokeswoman Lisa Greiner said. \n \n In addition, the basement of New York's Bellevue Hospital Center flooded, and the hospital was running off of emergency backup power. Ian Michaels of the Office of Emergency Management said the main priority is to help secure additional power and obtain additional fuel and pumps for the hospital. \n \n The storm hit near Atlantic City about 8 p.m. ET, the National Hurricane Center reported. It packed 80-mph winds at landfall, down from the 90 mph clocked earlier Monday. \n \n Superstorm Sandy's wrath \n \n \"I've been down here for about 16 years, and it's shocking what I'm looking at now. It's unbelievable,\" said Montgomery Dahm, owner of the Tun Tavern in Atlantic City, which stayed open as Sandy neared the Jersey Shore. \"I mean, there's cars that are just completely underwater in some of the places I would never believe that there would be water.\" \n \n Dahm's family cleared out of Atlantic City before the storm hit, but he says he stayed put to serve emergency personnel. At nightfall Monday, he said the water was lapping at the steps of his restaurant, where a generator was keeping the lights on. \n \n The storm had already knocked down power lines and tree limbs while still 50 miles offshore and washed out a section of the boardwalk on the north end of town, Atlantic City Mayor Lorenzo Langford told CNN. He said there were still \"too many people\" who didn't heed instructions to evacuate, and he urged anyone still in town to \"hunker down and try to wait this thing out.\" \n \n \"When Mother Nature sends her wrath your way, we're at her mercy, and so all we can do is stay prayerful and do the best that we can,\" Langford said. \n \n And in Seaside Heights, about 30 miles north of Atlantic City, Police Chief Thomas Boyd told CNN, \"The whole north side of my town is totally under water.\" \n \n Mass transit grinds to a halt \n \n In New York, lower Manhattan's Battery Park recorded nearly 14-foot tide, smashing a record set by 1960's Hurricane Donna by more than 3 feet. The city had already halted service on its bus and train lines, closing schools and ordering about 400,000 people out of their homes in low-lying areas of Manhattan and elsewhere. \n \n Flooding forced the closure of all three of the major airports in the area, LaGuardia, John F. Kennedy and Newark Liberty. Water seeped into subway stations in Lower Manhattan and into the tunnel connecting Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, while high winds damaged a crane perched atop a Midtown skyscraper under construction, forcing authorities to evacuate the surrounding area. \n \n New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg told reporters there was an \"extraordinary\" amount of water in Lower Manhattan, as well as downed trees throughout the city and widespread power outages. \n \n \"We knew that this was going to be a very dangerous storm, and the storm has met our expectations,\" he said. \"The worst of the weather has come, and city certainly is feeling the impacts.\" \n \n The storm was blamed for more than 2.8 million outages across the Northeast. About 350,000 of them were in the New York city area, where utility provider Con Edison reported it had also cut power to customers in parts of Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan to protect underground equipment as the storm waters rose. \n \n But as water crept into its substations, Con Ed said it had lost service to about 250,000 customers in Manhattan -- including most of the island south of 39th Street. \n \n Five things to know about Sandy \n \n At least five people had been killed in storm-related incidents in New York state, including three killed by trees falling on homes in Queens and in the town of New Salem, near Albany, city and state officials said. Falling trees were also blamed for three deaths reported in New Jersey and one in Connecticut, authorities there told CNN. \n \n In West Virginia, a woman was killed in a car accident after the storm dumped 5 inches of snow on the town of Davis, said Amy Shuler Goodwin, a spokeswoman for Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin's office. \n \n And before hitting land, it overwhelmed the sailing ship HMS Bounty, a replica of the historic British vessel, off North Carolina. Fourteen of the ship's crew of 16 were rescued, but the body of one deckhand was found Monday evening and the ship's captain was still missing Monday night, the Coast Guard said. \n \n Sandy had already claimed at least 67 lives in the Caribbean, including 51 in Haiti. \n \n Sandy's storm surges were boosted by a full moon, which already brings the highest tides of the month. And forecasters said the storm was likely to collide with a cold front and spawn a superstorm that could generate flash floods and snowstorms. \n \n \"It could be bad,\" said U.S. Coast Guard Rear Adm. Steven Rattior, \"or it could be devastation.\" \n \n Mass transit shut down across the densely populated Northeast, landmarks stood empty and schools and government offices were closed. The National Grid, which provides power to millions of customers, said 60 million people could be affected before it's over. \n \n On Fire Island, off Long Island, the water rose above promenades and docks on Monday afternoon, homeowner Karen Boss said. Boss stayed on the island with her husband despite a mandatory evacuation order. She said they own several properties and a business there and had weathered previous storms. \n \n \"I'm concerned that it might come into the first floor,\" she said. \"If that's the case, I'll just move into another house that's higher up.\" \n \n Based on pressure readings, it's likely to be the strongest storm to make landfall north of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, CNN senior meteorologist Dave Hennen said. The benchmark storm, the 1938 \"Long Island Express\" Hurricane, contained a low pressure reading of 946 millibars; Sandy had a minimum pressure of 943 millibars. Generally speaking, the lower the pressure, the stronger the storm. \n \n In Sea Bright, New Jersey, Yvette Cafaro scrawled a plea on the plywood that covered her burger restaurant: \"Be kind to us Sandy.\" The seaside area largely dodged last year's Hurricane Irene, but Cafaro was not optimistic that Sea Bright would be spared Sandy. \n \n Keep a hurricane preparation checklist \n \n \"Everything that we've been watching on the news looks like this one will really get us,\" she said. \"We're definitely worried about it.\" \n \n Its arrival, eight days before the U.S. presidential election, forced President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, to alter or cancel several campaign stops. Obama flew back to Washington from Florida, telling reporters at the White House that assets were in place for an effective response to the storm. \n \n \"The most important message I have for the public right now is please listen to what your state and local officials are saying,\" Obama said. \"When they tell you to evacuate, you need to evacuate.\" \n \n And in Ohio, Romney asked supporters to drop off items and cash at his \"victory centers\" to be donated to victims of the storm. \n \n \"There are families in harm's way that will be hurt -- either in their possessions or perhaps in something more severe,\" Romney said. \n \n Tips from Katrina survivors \n \n By Monday afternoon, 23 states were under a warning or advisory for wind related to Sandy. Thousands of flights had been canceled, and hundreds of roads and highways were expected to flood. And according to a government model, Sandy's wind damage alone could cause more than $7 billion in economic loss. \n \n Sandy was expected to weaken once it moves inland, but the center was expected to move slowly northward, meaning gusty winds and heavy rain would continue through Wednesday. \n \n On the western side of the storm, the mountains of West Virginia expected up to 3 feet of snow and the mountains of southwestern Virginia to the Kentucky state line could see up to 2 feet. Twelve to 18 inches of snow were expected in the mountains near the North Carolina-Tennessee border. \n \n \"This is not a typical storm,\" said Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett. \"Essentially, this is a hurricane wrapped in a 'nor'easter.'\" \n \n Sandy grounds thousands of flights worldwide \n \n CNN's Elizabeth Cohen, Dana Ford, Tom Watkins, Josh Levs, Chelsea J. Carter, Greg Botelho, Jason Kessler, Sarah Dillingham, Sean Morris, Ashley Corum, Eden Pontz and George Howell contributed to this report. ||||| Editor's Note: Sandy unleashed powerful winds and torrential rains Monday in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast as it sped toward shore. Subways and bridges were shut down and streets were quiet as gusts howled over a huge region encompassing hundreds of miles. At 7 p.m., the National Hurricane Center stopped classifying Sandy as a hurricane, though it still continued to pack a wallop. Here is the full story. \n \n Are you there?

(Jamie Smith Hopkins/Baltimore Sun) \n \n Power outages hit a plateau early Tuesday morning and began creeping downward, with about 186,000 Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. customers without electricity at noon, according to the company. \n \n The company said it has restored power to about 114,000 customers since storm operations began at 10 a.m. Sunday. \n \n BGE will assess the damage Tuesday and Wednesday as restoration efforts continue, said spokesman Rob Gould. He said the utility probably wouldn't be able to give an estimate until late Wednesday or Thursday about when all customers would see power restored. \n \n About 2,000 of the 3,000 out-of-state utility workers BGE requested are on hand to help mop up after Sandy, first a hurricane and later a post-tropical \"superstorm.\" BGE expects the remaining 1,000 mutual-assistance workers to filter in Tuesday, spokeswoman Rachael L. Lighty said. \n \n In addition to the out-of-state help, BGE has 2,100 people on storm detail, from lineman to tree contractors to call-center workers, Lighty said. As both winds and rain eased Tuesday morning, linemen were able to tackle problems that required elevated bucket trucks \u2014 work that had been suspended Monday afternoon as Sandy's effects worsened. \n \n \"Our crews are definitely working around the clock, but the majority of our crews are out during the day today,\" Lighty said. \n \n \"Superstorm\" or not, Sandy's wallop in the Baltimore region was muted compared with the June derecho storm and Hurricane Irene in 2011 \u2014 at least in terms of power outages. All told, about 300,000 BGE customers lost power starting Sunday, Lighty said, compared with about 750,000 customers during the derecho and Irene each. \n \n As of noon Tuesday, nearly 15 percent of customers in BGE's service area were still waiting for service to return after Sandy knocked down trees and power lines in its path. The largest number of outages were reported in Anne Arundel County (52,000), Baltimore County (49,000) and Harford County (42,000), with 15,000 out in the city, 14,000 out in Howard County and 3,000 out in Carroll County. \n \n The remainder of the outages in BGE's territory were reported in Calvert, Montgomery and Prince George's counties. \n \n Elsewhere in the state, just before noon: \n \n Pepco, which serves Washington and its Maryland suburbs, reported about 17,000 of its customers without power. \n \n Delmarva Power said 26,000 customers were without electricity in the Maryland portion of the Eastern Shore, while Choptank Electric Cooperative reported 9,900 customers without power in that region. \n \n Potomac Edison was reporting about 58,000 customers without power in Western Maryland. \n \n Southern Maryland Electric Cooperative had about 2,200 customers without power in its Southern Maryland territory. \n \n BGE asked all customers whose power goes out \u2014 even customers with smart meters \u2014 to call 877-778-2222 to report the outage. \n \n BGE has established five staging areas for its crews: M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore, Ripken Stadium in Aberdeen, the Maryland State Fairgrounds in Timonium, Baltimore-Washington Thurgood Marshall International Airport and Six Flags America in Upper Marlboro, Gould said. \n \n At the staging area just outside M&T Bank Stadium, out-of-state workers paired up with BGE employees and headed out early Tuesday to neighborhoods with outages. BGE set up a large tent for workers to eat and drop off laundry. Generators and truck engines combined into an ever-present hum. \n \n Among the out-of-state help was a 114-person team from Commonwealth Edison Co. in Chicago, which like BGE is owned by Exelon Corp. Crews came east with ComEd's mobile command center, leaving around 9 a.m. Saturday and arriving at 3:30 p.m. Sunday. \n \n \"Our goal is to get Baltimore up and running,\" said Ty Watson, a ComEd heavy-equipment hauler. \n \n With the wind dying down Tuesday, it should be easier for lineman to get the power back on, said Bob Johnson, ComEd's director of emergency preparedness.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Superstorm Sandy is battering coastal communities tonight with storm surges, downpours, and high winds, causing power outages and evacuation orders from Vermont to Virginia. No longer officially a hurricane, Sandy is starting to merge with two cold fronts, becoming bigger and messier but slightly weaker, sustaining winds of 85mph, according to CNN. As of this evening, about 2 million were without power along the eastern seaboard, according to the AP and other sources. Some specifics: Facing a direct hit, New Jersey is suffering flooding, high winds, and 434,000 power outages. Part of the Garden State Highway has been closed due to rising waters, and Atlantic City is so flooded that cars are underwater, CNN reports. Part of the city's famed boardwalk has been washed away. Hoboken, meanwhile, is banning all driving after 4pm. New York City is expecting storm surges as high as 11 feet. Thousands of flights have been canceled, and the subway has been shut down. Gov. Andrew Cuomo has requested 1,000 National Guard troops be deployed. About 452,000 are without power, and emergency crews have responded to a construction crane hanging dangerously from a luxury high-rise. The story is similar in Pennsylvania, specifically Philadelphia, which has also shut down its mass transit system, and seen hundreds of flights canceled. Officials say wind could reach 75mph and rainfall 10 inches. National Guardsmen have been told to be ready for deployment. Power outages: 74,000. Flooding is expected to knock out power stations in Connecticut, killing power for 117,400. Several coastal communities in Massachusetts are being urged to voluntarily evacuate, the Boston Globe reports, and in Boston all subway and bus service was shut down at 2pm. Nearly 1,000 crews are out helping more than 300,000 who have lost power. Flooding is expected along the coast with this evening's high tide. Washington, DC closed its rail service for the first time since 2003, and the federal government has closed up shop save for emergency employees, the Washington Post reports. Nearly 5,500 are without power. In Virginia about 9,500 people are without power, and the same could happen to about 1 million more. Chincoteague Island is entirely underwater with 3,500 residents who decided to tough it out. Maryland has seen damage to an iconic ocean pier in Ocean City, and a blizzard warning has been issued for the mountainous western part of the state. About 145,000 are without power, the Baltimore Sun reports. West Virginia has blizzard fears as well, with as many as 14 counties told to prepare for high winds, heavy snows, and flooded towns. Vermont has declared a state of emergency to give it access to National Guard troops. According to the AP, the state still hasn't fully recovered from the damage wrought by Hurricane Irene. About 14,470 have lost power. Rhode Island officials say wind could drive water up Narragansett Bay and flood low-lying areas. About 110,000 are without power. Keep checking back for more.",

The situation is so bad, I live with 20 other people in one room,\" Bushra told reporters in the Lebanese city of Tripoli. \n \n 'Tremendous burden' \n \n Many of those who have fled conflict now live in difficult conditions, with poor sanitation and insufficient resources to cope with the harsh winters. \n \n At the scene Some 2,000 refugees crossed into Jordan from Syria in the past 24 hours. Many were brought to the large tent for new arrivals just inside the Zaatari camp. They could be seen lying sprawled, exhausted and dishevelled, on mats and blankets laid on the floor. \"We came because of the shelling and air strikes. They destroyed our houses, they left nothing for us,\" said an old woman from Homs. \"It took us nearly five days to get here walking through fields.\" A young mother told us how Syrian forces had shot at them as they tried to leave. \"We were so afraid we had an accident on the road. We thought we were going to die,\" she said. By late afternoon, the refugees were registered by the UNHCR and had moved to their own basic shelters. But officials here say the increasing flow of refugees threatens to overwhelm them. \"The international community is failing to find a political solution inside Syria and so people are continuing to flee,\" says Andrew Harper, head of UNHCR in Jordan. \"We'll probably have another 100,000 people arrive in the next four or five weeks.\" \n \n In Lebanon, for example, the influx of almost a third of a million refugees since last February has swollen the country's population by 10%. \n \n Turkey, providing a temporary home for some 184,000 refugees, has spent more than $600m (459m euros; \u00a3396m) setting up 17 refugee camps, and is building new ones to meet the increasing need, the UN said. \n \n \"These countries should not only be recognised for their unstinting commitment to keeping their borders open for Syrian refugees, they should be massively supported as well,\" Mr Guterres said. \n \n On Tuesday, Jordan's King Abdullah called on world nations to help his country, Turkey and Lebanon to shoulder \"the tremendous burden\" of caring for the huge influx of people. \n \n 'Catastrophic proportions' \n \n UK charity Oxfam says that only 20% of $1.5bn promised by international donors in January has arrived, \"leaving agencies struggling to respond to the urgent needs of refugees\". \n \n The rush of refugees has surprised even UN experts, who had originally estimated that the one million figure would not be reached until the end of June 2013. \n \n In effect, more than 400,000 have became refugees since 1 January 2013. \n \n The UN's emergency response plan for Syrian refugees, Oxfam said, currently lacked 75% of the funding required. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Nik Gowing reports as Bushra, 19, registers as the millionth refugee \n \n Jordan's Petra news agency said that a total of 2,257 Syrian refugees had crossed into the country on Tuesday alone. \n \n Some 110,000 of those who have sought shelter in Jordan are living in the desert camp of Zaatari, near its northern border with Syria. \n \n The conflict in Syria began almost two years ago with demonstrations against the government of President Bashar al-Assad. \n \n The protests quickly turned violent as opponents of Mr Assad took up arms to try to resist a brutal crackdown by the authorities. \n \n The conflict has left more than 70,000 people dead and two million internally displaced, of a pre-conflict population of 20.7 million. \n \n Also on Wednesday, the Commander of the rebel Free Syrian Army, Gen Selim Idriss, called for the lifting of the EU arms embargo against Syria, saying it is having a much more negative effect on the opposition than on the Assad regime. \n \n Gen Idriss told the BBC's Chris Morris in Brussels that opposition forces desperately needed weapons and ammunition, and that the war would be longer and bloodier if the embargo remained in place. \n \n UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said on Wednesday that the UK was going to provide armoured vehicles and body armour to Syrian opposition forces in a bid to end a crisis that had reached what he called \"catastrophic proportions\". \n \n His announcement in the House of Commons stopped short of arming the rebels, but he told the BBC on Sunday that the UK would not rule out doing so in future. \n \n In a separate development, Arab League foreign ministers invited the Syrian main opposition to take the country's seat at the league. \n \n The ministers asked the Syrian National Coalition to send its representative to the group's meeting in Doha later this month. \n \n The 22-member league suspended Syria's membership in 2011. ||||| A line of Syrian refugee women, some carrying children, cross into Jordan from southern Syria. The outflow this year has been staggering. \u00a9 UNHCR/N.Daoud \n \n GENEVA, March 6 (UNHCR) - The UN refugee agency, citing data received from UNHCR's offices in the Syria region, on Wednesday announced that the number of Syrians either registered as refugees or being assisted as such has reached the 1 million mark. \n \n \"With a million people in flight, millions more displaced internally, and thousands of people continuing to cross the border every day, Syria is spiralling towards full-scale disaster,\" said UN High Commissioner for Refugees Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. \"We are doing everything we can to help, but the international humanitarian response capacity is dangerously stretched. This tragedy has to be stopped.\" \n \n The number of Syrian refugees fleeing their country has increased dramatically since the beginning of the year. More than 400,000 people have become refugees since January 1, 2013. They arrive traumatized, without possessions and having lost members of their families. Around half of the refugees are children, the majority under the age of eleven. Most have fled to Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and Egypt. Increasingly, Syrians are also fleeing to North Africa and Europe. \n \n \"This number translates into 1 million people who are dependent on the generosity of host countries, the response of humanitarian agencies and the financial support of governments and individuals,\" said Guterres. \n \n The High Commissioner noted that the impact of this large number of refugees arriving in neighbouring countries is severe. Lebanon's population has increased by as much as 10 per cent. Jordan's energy, water, health and education services are being strained to the limit. Turkey has spent over US$600 million setting up 17 refugee camps, with more under construction. Iraq, juggling its own crisis with more than 1 million Iraqis internally displaced, has received more than 100,000 Syrian refugees in the past year. \n \n \"These countries should not only be recognized for their unstinting commitment to keeping their borders open for Syrian refugees, they should be massively supported as well,\" said Guterres. \n \n Bushra, the 1 millionth Syrian refugee, in Tripoli, Lebanon, with her children. \u00a9 UNHCR/E.Byun \n \n UNHCR named Bushra, a 19-year-old mother of two, as the symbolic 1 millionth refugee. She was registered in the coastal city of Tripoli in northern Lebanon on Wednesday. She has been living in a dilapidated two-room building in a Tripoli slum since crossing the border just over two weeks ago. \n \n When UNHCR visited her earlier this week, she was holding her son Sleiman in the corner where they sleep at night. Her daughter Hanin, aged three, huddled close to her mother in the room they share with 12 other refugees. \n \n Her flight to Lebanon was a desperate last measure. She moved with her children from the city of Homs, where she lived, and sought safety in several villages to avoid tanks and shelling and gangs of men whom she feared would rape or kill her and her little ones. But soon, she said, the shooting would begin, the shelling would rain down and it would be time to leave. \n \n Before the conflict, she lived with her husband of five years and his family. He was a truck driver and was able to provide for the family. Now he is missing. \"We need help,\" Bushra said. \"We hope this will end so we can go back to our house. We need to feel peace and stability. We cannot ask for anything more.\" \n \n In December, the UN's Regional Response Plan for Syrian Refugees estimated that 1.1 million Syrian refugees would arrive in neighbouring countries by the end of June 2013. UNHCR is in the process of adjusting this plan, in light of the new figures. Currently, the plan is only about 25 per cent funded. \n \n Without a political solution to the conflict, Guterres said, \"at a minimum, humanitarian actors should receive the funds needed to save lives and ease suffering.\" \n \n The Syria crisis will be two years old next week. High Commissioner Guterres will be travelling to the region later this week to visit UNHCR operations in Turkey, Jordan, and Lebanon. \n \n 5134a41f9",

The UN hadn't expected to pass the 1 million mark for three more months, the BBC reports.

Staffers scrambled to check in as many outstanding ballots as they could before the 7 pm deadline. \n \n The Miami-Dade Elections Department is counting absentee ballots a day after the election. They hope to finish today. \n \n Don\u0092t expect election results from Miami-Dade County anytime soon. \n \n The county\u0092s beleaguered elections supervisor told reporters Wednesday night that her employees, still processing thousands of absentee ballots, won\u0092t finish until Thursday. \n \n Supervisor Penelope Townsley acknowledged that mistakes had been made in the elections process, according to Miami Herald news partner WFOR-CBS4. She spoke after another day during which elections workers fed thousands of pages of ballots into scanning machines. \n \n With the presidential race settled \u0097 but Florida still too close to call \u0097 Miami-Dade\u0092s lack of final results have left a much-mocked blank spot on the long-decided electoral map. \n \n Earlier Wednesday, the county had said 20,000 absentee ballots still needed to be counted. The office of Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez issued a news release insisting that the \u0093unprecedented length of the ballot\u0094 represents \u0093over 100,000 pages that need to be reviewed and verified, one by one.\u0094 \n \n \u0093This in no way is representative of any issues or delays, but a matter of unprecedented volume,\u0094 the release said, noting that the county\u0092s canvassing board is continuing to examine suspect absentee ballots. \n \n Overall, President Barack Obama had more than 61 percent of the vote in Miami-Dade, or 521,329 votes, while Mitt Romney had 317,382, or 37.6 percent, according to the election department\u0092s website. The county was plagued Tuesday by embarrassing delays and long lines preventing the state to be called for Obama or Romney. \n \n Deputy Elections Supervisor Christina White insisted Wednesday morning that an unusually long ballot and high voter turnout, which was 64 percent, was to blame, not a lack of resources. \n \n \u0093Its not that there were any problems or glitches,\u0094 White told reporters. \u0093It\u0092s about volume and paper left to be processed.\u0094 \n \n Miami-Dade elections staffers worked overnight Tuesday and through Wednesday to count some 30,000 absentee ballots that had been dropped off or mailed to the Doral headquarters and county government center in downtown Miami at the last minute. The ballots had to be turned in by 7 p.m. Tuesday to be eligible for counting. \n \n Teams of staffers counted 10,000 overnight, but still had another 20,000 to review Wednesday afternoon at the Doral headquarters. \n \n The process is slow and tedious. To start, a dozen elections staffers must electronically compare images of voters\u0092 signatures on absentee ballots with the signatures on the voters\u0092 registration cards. Then the workers must determine whether the ballots have been properly filled out before counting them in scanning machines. \n \n If staffers reject any ballots, they set them aside for the Miami-Dade canvassing board to make the final call. The board, sitting in an adjacent room, consists of the chair, County Judge Shelley Kravitz, County Judge Andrew Hague, and the county supervisor of elections, Penelope Townsley. \n \n The elections office must also count all provisional ballots by 5 p.m. Thursday. White said she did not know the total number of provisional ballots. \n \n Obama won\u0092t lose the lead in Miami-Dade, where his campaign had a massive grass-roots operation. But how the final batch of ballots affects the overall number in Florida remains to be seen \u0097 Obama leads by just over 46,000, according to the state election department\u0092s most recent numbers. \n \n The race could still be close enough to trigger a recount in Florida, unless it is waived by Romney, who lost the overall election to the president. \n \n On Wednesday afternoon, the total difference between the candidates hovered just above the .5 percentage point needed to trigger a recount as the final absentee and early voting numbers trickled in across the state. With such a razor-thin margin, no media outlets had called Florida for Obama or Romney. \n \n Overall in Florida, at least 8,307,749 voters cast ballots for president, just under the number cast in 2008, when Obama won handily. \n \n In Miami-Dade, so far, it appears the number of voters who cast ballots for president will be just shy of the 864,636 who did so four years ago. \n \n Lines were so long in some polling places here that the last voter did not leave the West Kendall Regional Library until a few minutes after 1 a.m. \n \n When polls officially closed at 7 p.m. hundreds of people were still waiting to cast ballots in precincts around South Florida, in an election that was marked by long lines and the occasional problem. Even after the networks called the race for President Obama, people in South Florida remained in line. \n \n Voters complained that many stations lacked enough poll workers, scanning machines and privacy booths to address the crowds. Dozens of workers were diverted from closed polling places to others that faced daunting queues, and 150 extra optical scanners were distributed throughout the day. \n \n This article will be updated as more information becomes available. ||||| Most people are aware now that Governor Gary Johnson received over 1% of the vote, including over 1.1 million raw votes.

That number could go as high as 130k. \n \n Roseanne Barr, without any write-in votes included, has polled 49,412 votes, which will likely be good enough for sixth place. With write-ins and remaining votes to be counted, Barr is expected to get over 50k. \n \n Rocky Anderson\u2019s vote total currently stands at 34,521. With remaining votes and write-ins, he might reach 40k. \n \n Thomas Hoefling scored 28,593 votes so far, with 94.6% of those votes coming from California. \n \n So far, no other candidate has received more than 15k votes.

(AP) \u2014 A winter storm was bearing down on the Northeast, promising heavy snows, strong winds and bitter temperatures that will make commutes hazardous for the first work day of the new year. \n \n People enjoy a snow-covered Cloud Gate at Millennium Park in downtown Chicago, which became a great photo opportunity for visitors, Wednesday, Jan. 1, 2014. As much as 9 inches of snow has fallen in some... (Associated Press) \n \n Snow began falling overnight in parts of New England and New York but the real brunt of the storm wasn't expected to hit until later Thursday. As much as a foot of snow or more was forecast for some areas overnight Thursday into Friday, and temperatures were expected to plummet, with some areas seeing highs just above zero, the National Weather Service said. \n \n \"There will be travel problems,\" said Hugh Johnson, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Albany, N.Y. \"It will be very cold.\" \n \n Up to 14 inches of snow is forecast for the Boston area and the National Weather Service issued a blizzard warning for Long Island \u2014 where 8 to 10 inches of snow could fall and winds could gust up to 45 mph \u2014 from Thursday evening into Friday afternoon. \n \n The storm dropped a half-foot or more of snow in Illinois on Wednesday, prompting hundreds of flight cancellations into and out of Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, according to the aviation tracking website FlightAware.com. More than 900 U.S. flights were canceled for Thursday, with O'Hare and Newark Liberty International most affected. \n \n Authorities said the weather may have been a factor in a fatal crash Wednesday evening involving a pickup and a bus carrying casino patrons in Indiana. Police said the truck's driver was killed and 15 bus passengers were hurt in the collision on a snow-covered and slushy highway in Rolling Prairie. \n \n Sections of interior southern New England and New York could get up to a foot of snow by the time the storm moves out, with forecasts generally calling for 6 to 12 inches. New York City, likely to see 3 to 7 inches, issued a snow alert. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo urged the city's commuters to leave their cars at home in case major highways are closed for Thursday's evening rush hour. \n \n \"We are looking at a serious storm situation,\" Cuomo said. \n \n Although lesser amounts of snow were forecast to the south, Philadelphia and parts of southern New Jersey were expected to see 3 to 7 inches of blowing, drifting snow. \n \n In Toms River, N.J., Jonas Caldwell said he was prepared for whatever the storm might bring. \n \n \"Santa brought me a snow blower, and I've got rock salt for the ice, so now I'm just waiting for the storm,\" he said while grabbing a coffee at a convenience store. \n \n Caldwell, an investment adviser, said he could work from home if necessary, but he was hoping that wouldn't be the case. \n \n \"There are too many distractions at home,\" he said. \"But I won't be stupid ... If it gets as bad as they say it will be, or looks like it will, I'll be staying put.\" \n \n In Hartford, Hal Guy, of nearby Glastonbury, was shopping for snow shovels \u2014 three, to be exact. \n \n \"We broke a couple in the last storm,\" he said. \"We have four kids, so, three shovels, and we still have a little one back home.\" \n \n Guy said three of his kids, girls ages 8, 10 and 12, have been out of school for two weeks for the holidays and hope to get a couple more days off with the snow. \n \n Over in Maine, where some communities are still recovering from a recent ice storm that cut power to more than 100,000 customers, people seemed prepared for more winter weather. \n \n Kelly St. Denis, of Auburn, went skiing Wednesday at the Sunday River ski area with family and friends.

Andrew Cuomo said. \n \n The nor'easter, forming off the East Coast of the United States, prompted blizzard warnings from Thursday into Friday for New York's Long Island, Cape Cod, Massachusetts' South and North Shores, plus communities along Maine's coast. Boston, for example, was already getting buried by snow late Thursday afternoon. \n \n About one-third of the nation, approximately 100 million people in 22 states, was in the path of the storm, which was expected to be at its fiercest between 8 p.m. Thursday and 10 a.m. Friday, according to CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen. \n \n The complicated storm system \"will raise havoc\" this week, dumping a foot of snow and spreading subzero wind chills across parts of the region, the National Weather Service warned. \n \n \"Falling and blowing snow with strong winds and poor visibilities are likely,\" the Weather Service said . \"This will lead to whiteout conditions making travel extremely dangerous. Do not travel.\" \n \n Across the country, the nasty weather has snarled travel plans for many. \n \n More than 2,200 U.S. flights had been canceled as of 10:45 p.m. Thursday, reported FlightAware.com , which tracks cancellations due to weather and mechanical problems. It's not like things will suddenly clear up: the same website reports that some 1,000 flights already have been canceled in advance for Friday. \n \n Thursday's most affected airport was Chicago's O'Hare, with more than 650 cancellations in and out and about the same number of delays. Newark's Liberty International Airport, New York's LaGuardia and Cleveland's Hopkins also were affected. \n \n American, US Airways, United, Many airlines are allowing passengers to make fee-free itinerary changes for destinations expected to be affected by winter storms. Delta Southwest/AirTran and JetBlue have all posted weather advisories on their websites. \n \n Inside some airports, would-have-been travelers scrambled to rearrange flights or find a place to stay knowing that some things were out of their control. \n \n \"The warning has been coming for a couple of days, so we expected it,\" a man from South Carolina said from Boston's Logan Airport, as he headed with his family to a hotel and, hopefully, a Boston Bruins game knowing they couldn't fly, reported CNN affiliate WCVB . \"We are stuck, we'll make the best of it.\" \n \n Brenda Kopytko is luckily home in South Windsor, Connecticut, having ventured out into the snow earlier. A New England winter veteran, she's taking it in stride -- \"This is nothing\" -- if not the possibility of strong winds and power outages, particularly after being in the dark for nine days after last winter's storm. \n \n \"Once the winds start going and the branches start snapping, then I get a little nervous,\" Kopytko said. \n \n Here's a breakdown of what to expect where: \n \n New York and Long Island \n \n As of Thursday night, New York City was under a winter storm warning, as were many other densely populated areas in seven other states. \n \n The city of 8 million people could get 9 inches of snow, subzero wind chills and turbulent winds, forecasters said. \n \n New York City is expecting to see 6 to 12 inches of snow overnight, with more possible on Long Island, where Nassau and Suffolk counties will be under a blizzard warning until 1 p.m. Friday, with predictions of 8 to 10 inches of snow, wind chills as low as 10 below zero and sustained winds of at least 35 mph. \n \n Bitter cold will follow, with temperatures in the single digits by Saturday morning. \n \n Upstate, the capital city of Albany could get buried under 14 inches of snow, with wind chills of 15 to 25 below zero, the National Weather Service said. \n \n Cuomo declared a state of emergency for all of New York shortly after 3:45 p.m. Thursday, one of several steps taken to try to minimize the wild wintry weather's toll. \n \n Among them is shutting down parts of Interstate 84, an east-west highway that goes from Connecticut to Pennsylvania, to commercial vehicles late Thursday afternoon, with nearby I-87 south of Albany closing at midnight. \n \n That's the same time the Long Island Expressway -- in a different part of the state -- will close to traffic at the border between Nassau County and the Queens borough of New York. The hope is to reopen all these roads around 5 a.m., though that timing is very much subject to change. \n \n \"We'll make sure no one is in a state of danger on those roads,\" said Cuomo. \n \n Massachusetts \n \n By Friday night, Boston is expected to be covered by 10 to 18 inches of snow, about twice the amount forecast just one day ago, and shivering in temperatures as low as 6 degrees below zero. \n \n Citing likely \"near blizzard\" conditions Thursday night into late Friday morning, the state's emergency management agency warned that some areas could be hit hard -- including up to two feet of snow on parts of the North Shore and South Shore, as well as Cape Cod. \n \n The forecast was so bad for Boston that the city canceled school for Friday two days in advance, with scores of other school districts quickly following suit. \n \n \"I guess Mother Nature wanted to give me one more gift,\" Mayor Thomas Menino told reporters Thursday in one of his last days in the job he has held since 1993. \n \n \"Take precautions and take public transportation and take care of one another,\" he urged. But, he added, the city was doing its part, with 700 pieces of equipment on city streets. \"Our team is ready,\" he said. \n \n The combination of extreme cold, snow and strong winds had officials at homeless shelters preparing. \n \n \"Our main emphasis is getting people inside, where it is safer and warmer,\" said Jennifer Harris, a spokeswoman for the Pine Street Inn shelter system in Boston, where a snow emergency has been declared. \"Pine Street Inn is making sure to have extra staff and food and water. We are geared up to provide to a greater number of people.\" \n \n Blizzard warnings haven't been issued for Boston itself, but are in effect for parts of nearby Essex and Plymouth counties -- including the communities of Gloucester, Brockton and Plymouth -- as well as the Cape. \n \n Because of the storm, the state Emergency Management Agency warned that the midnight and Friday midday high tides could produce \"significant flooding\" along the coast. To this point, the towns of Scituate and Duxbury requested voluntary evacuations for residents of certain low-lying areas. \n \n Connecticut \n \n Wind chills in parts of Connecticut are expected to range from -5 to -20 degrees Thursday night and Friday; the National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings for most of the state through Friday morning. \n \n Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy urged residents to take it slow and give themselves extra time for their commutes Thursday and Friday. He said he expects there will be delays, but not cancellations, in public transit. \n \n Addressing reporters, Malloy said the worst time for the state would be overnight -- between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m., when there could be blizzard conditions. Still, the storm's impact could linger well beyond that if roads are blocked or the electricity goes out. \n \n He acknowledged that this kind of weather is hardly unprecedented in Connecticut this time of year. Still, the governor added, what sets this system apart is the frigid temperatures forecast for the coming days. \n \n That's a big concern throughout the region, especially for the homeless and people stranded -- whether along a road or inside without adequate heat or power -- by the bad weather. \n \n \"(This) is not a big New England storm, but it is a particularly cold New England storm,\" Malloy said. \n \n Chicago and points beyond \n \n Seven to 11 inches of snow were possible Thursday in Chicago, according to the National Weather Service. Windy City residents will feel frigid temps -- wind chills during the day Friday will creep down to minus 12 -- and emergency director Gary Schenkel said more snow is possible later in the week. \n \n Though snow in Chicago in the winter is a common event, it \"can still wreak havoc on daily routines,\" he noted. \n \n Next week could be no better for some U.S. residents. \n \n A new shot of colder air will start to move into the northern Midwest by Saturday and will dive south Monday and Tuesday, carrying zero-degree cold as far south as Nashville. \"That's the coldest air we've seen that far south in several years,\" said Hennen, the CNN meteorologist. \n \n The cold air will kick off a new storm Sunday into Monday that could affect a number of high-profile NFL playoff games this weekend. \n \n In Wisconsin, the Green Bay Packers will give a cold welcome to the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday, when temperatures could bottom out at -17. \n \n But it will be relatively balmy Sunday in Cincinnati, where snow and rain are possible when the city's Bengals host the San Diego Chargers in another NFL playoff matchup. \n \n Of course, while the players might not have a choice, fans don't have to brave the cold for either game. The big worries are for those who travel in the coming days. Authorities in New York, for example, said they may shut the Long Island Expressway if whiteout conditions make driving along the east-west highway too perilous. \n \n Kevin Willims isn't taking any chances, nor is he predicting a world-ending storm. The New Yorker said he plans to sit tight and let Mother Nature do her thing. \n \n \"There's not much you can do,\" Willims said. \"When it's snowing and these streets lock up, there's really nowhere you can go, so it's best to just stay in.\" \n \n That sentiment was echoed by James Montford, who told CNN Boston affiliate WHDH that he is looking forward to creating some art in the comforts of home. \n \n \"This a great day to kind of hunker down,\" Montford said. ||||| Alexus Laster walks through snow in Buffalo on the way to church on Dec. 26, 2013.

The heaviest snow will fall mainly in northern Illinois, northern Indiana, southern Michigan and southern Ohio. \n \n Chicago could see as much as 6-8 inches of snow from late Tuesday through late Thursday, which WGN meteorologist Tom Skilling says will arrive \"in waves rather than a single stretch.\" \n \n The Weather Channel has named the storm \"Hercules\" as part of its winter storm naming system. \n \n Meanwhile, the weather service said, rain \u2014 at times heavy \u2014 will push through the Southeast. \n \n The Winter Classic outdoor NHL hockey game in Ann Arbor, Mich., between the Maple Leafs and Red Wings, was played in snowy conditions Wednesday. \n \n Arctic chill will also still be a concern on Wednesday, as the \"bitter cold will continue over the Northern Plains and upper Midwest, with temperatures running as much as 20 to 30 degrees below normal,\" the weather service predicted. \n \n So far this month, International Falls, Minn., has endured eight days when the temperature has dropped below minus-30 degrees, which is a record, according to meteorologist Cory Mottice of AccuWeather Enterprise Solutions. \n \n Some of the coldest air in years will roar into the Northeast after the snowstorm departs Friday, according to AccuWeather meteorologist Bernie Rayno. \"This is likely to be the coldest weather for much of the Northeast since January 2009,\" Rayno said. \n \n Lows in cities such as Philadelphia, New York and Baltimore will drop into the single digits Friday night. \n \n Contributing: Greg Toppo",

    "document": "(CNN) Seven dollars multiplied by empathy on an online fundraising page equals more than $11,000 for a pizza delivery guy who received an apology for how he was treated at a Massachusetts business. \n \n The sales manager of a Westport car dealership has apologized \"for the actions\" of employees caught on camera \"belittling\" the delivery driver. The conversation in an office focused on whether the driver believed he had received a tip or should have made change for the order. \n \n \"We will [sic] like to apologize for the actions that led to this situation, this embarrassing video gone viral on the Internet, was not released by any employee of F&R Auto Sales,\" Gary Batista, sales manager for the business, said in a statement provided to CNN. \n \n A GoFundme.Com page set up by a woman who saw the video had raised $11,500 for the driver by Thursday night. \n \n The situation began Saturday, when Palace Pizza delivery guy Jarrid Tansey delivered $42 worth of pizzas and drinks to the dealership. He was paid $50 in two $20s and two $5s, said Palace Pizza manager Adam Willoughby. \n \n When he returned from the delivery, someone from the car dealership called Willoughby, asking for the driver to return with change -- roughly $7 and some coins. \n \n The video begins when Tansey returns to the dealership with the money. \n \n Upon handing over the change to a man seated behind a desk, Tansey can be heard saying, \"It just doesn't make sense why you'd hand me a bill that you were just gonna have me drive back here to give you back anyway.\" \n \n The man says to Tansey, \"I gave you everything they gave me so we would get the correct change.\" \n \n The two go back and forth a few more times, neither giving up his position. \n \n \"I'm not mad, I just had to waste my resources coming back here,\" Tansey says as he starts to leave. \n \n The man says to Tansey, \"The manager apologized once for you, do you want him to apologize again for you?\"\" \n \n Tansey responds, \"You got your $7 back, so the world is right now.\" \n \n One female employee follows Tansey out of the office, saying to him, \"Out the door before I put my foot in your a**,\" which prompts her co-workers to erupt in laughter. \n \n That woman's employment has since been terminated, according to Batista's statement. One of those involved was not an employee, he said. \n \n The video ends after another man, also using expletives, instructs his colleague to get Tansey's \"owner and manager\" on the phone. \n \n \"I want him fired,\" he says. \n \n Amanda Rogers, a former waitress, was so moved after seeing Tansey's video on LiveLeak, she called the pizza shop to find out the driver's name so she could send him a check. \n \n \"For them to call him back over money he should've received anyway,\" Rogers said, \"I decided to take it one step further.\" \n \n \"Why not get the kid more than he deserves?\" she said. \n \n Rogers set up the fundraising page for Tansey. It's entitled \"Get Jarrid his tip money!\" \n \n Many are leaving donations in $7 increments, the amount Tansey drove back to return to the dealership. One commenter wrote, \"You are a good example of someone treating people the way you want to be treated.\" \n \n Rogers, who was a stranger to Tansey and his wife before this all started, said she hopes the response would prove that, \"people are actually nice out there.\" \n \n The video, seemingly shot by a stationary surveillance camera, was initially posted on YouTube with the headline \"irate pizza driver.\" It has since been made private, and it's unclear who posted it, though Batista said in his statement the person is not an employee of F&R Auto Sales and had no authorization to do so. \n \n Batista said the owner and proprietor plan to offer Tansey a cash donation, though his statement doesn't specify how much or whether they've spoken to the driver. \n \n Willoughby said the son of the owner of the dealership stopped by Palace Pizza on Wednesday to offer an apology in person. \n \n Willoughby said the response at Palace Pizza has also been overwhelming. \n \n \"It's been tough to make pizzas with all the calls we've taken,\" he said. ||||| A video of car dealership employees in Westport getting into a heated argument with a local pizza delivery man over $7 has led to Internet anger and a personal apology. \n \n The video, posted on Liveleak, begins with a delivery man returning $7 in cash to the dealership that he had thought was a tip. By the end of the video, one dealership worker threatens to \u201cput my foot in your ass\u201d and another says he will call the delivery man\u2019s manager and get him fired. \n \n (Warning: The video contains some NSFW language.) \n \n Advertisement - Continue Reading Below \n \n The delivery man in the video is an employee at Palace Pizza named Jarrid Tansey, according to two employees there. Lianette Hernandez, a cook and cashier, and Adam Willoughby, a manager, confirmed the video came from an interaction at the nearby dealership F&R Auto Sales on Saturday. \n \n The total bill for the pizza and drinks was just over $42, Hernandez said, and dealership workers gave Tansey $50 in two twenties and two fives. In the video, Tansey says he confirmed that they wanted to give the whole $50, and then left with what he assumed was a $7-and-change tip. \n \n However, the dealership then called the pizza place back and forced him to return the $7-and-change, and he was left without a tip, leading to the heated conversation on video. \n \n \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make sense why you\u2019d hand me a bill that you were just gonna have me drive back here to give you back anyway,\u201d Tansey says in the video. \u201cI\u2019m not mad, I just had to waste my resources coming back here.\u201d \n \n But the office-workers are adamant about their position in the video. \n \n \u201cSo listen: The manager apologized once for you.

However, a Google index of the video shows the title as originally being \u201cirate pizza driver.\u201d The angle of the video suggests it comes from a stationary security camera inside the dealership\u2019s office. \n \n Willoughby, who was working that night, said he got a call from F&R Auto Sales saying that Tansey had \u201cverbally berated\u201d them. He said they took the call seriously at first and asked Tansey about the interaction. After Tansey explained what had happened, managers decided not to discipline the driver. \n \n \u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time we have had problems with F&R Auto,\u201d Willoughby said. \n \n \u201cAll the time, there\u2019s always a problem, always an issue,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been going back and forth with them for a long time.\u201d \n \n Palace Pizza has been getting supportive calls all day from across the country, and several people have pledged to raise or donate money for Tansey. \n \n In addition, the owner of the dealership and his son came by to apologize to Palace Pizza in person on Wednesday. \n \n \u201cI was the manager on that night, and today they came and spoke to me, profusely apologized,\u201d Willoughby said. \u201cWe both want to make things right between us. We don\u2019t want any bad blood.\u201d \n \n Commenters who claim to have seen the YouTube video before it was made private identify the dealership as F & R Auto Sales in Westport. Review pages of that dealership on Yelp and Google were being flooded with negative ratings on Wednesday. In addition, the dealership\u2019s website struggled to load. \n \n Calls to the dealership through their main phone line did not go through.

    "document": "Washington state Health Department \n \n The reactors on all the plants scrammed, shut off immediately as they were designed to do. \n \n Control rods were properly lowered into the uranium-filled pools to stop the nuclear reaction that generates the heat and steam that move huge turbines that generate the power. \n \n Enormous, high-volume pumps kicked in to send cooling water through the intricately designed, uranium-235-filled fuel rods, to prevent them from melting. \n \n Sponsored Links \n \n Radiation is terrifying to most people. And the less you actually know about it, the more frightening it can be.Watching what looked like an endless Hollywood production of carnage in the coastal communities of northeastern Japan as they were inundated by earthquakes and 30-foot-tall, tsunami-driven waves was bad enough. But then the fires of disbelief were stoked anew as panting cable news crews ticked off details of six separate nuclear reactors that had completely or partially melted down or were soon expected to.Older TV viewers might recall being terrified, along with the rest of the world, as they watched the nuclear-disaster-that-could-never-happen at Three Mile Island unit 2 along the Susquehanna River near Harrisburg, Pa., in 1979. Or the even more disastrous explosion seven years later at Chernobyl Reactor No. 4 in the Ukraine.These earth-shaking events involved a single reactor, not the six that are now focusing the world's attention on the Fukushima I and Fukushima II nuclear complexes 150 miles north of Tokyo.Nuclear event and emergency-response experts huddled over the weekend in command centers from the White House to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to state governments in California, Oregon and Washington. They watched the latest news unfold half a world away on big screens and shared information on dedicated, confidential government hot lines.They saw Japan's multiple-redundant nuclear safeguards work, at first.All worked according to much-practiced plans. But then, suddenly, a flood of information from the Japanese government described a cascade of almost unbelievable reports.The power running the pumps died. The locomotive-sized diesel backup generators were destroyed by the flooding from the tsunamis. Neutron-absorbing boron and seawater -- a combination so corrosive that it was a death sentence for the reactors -- was pumped in, in a final effort to avoid a nuclear meltdown.Then, like scenes from \"The China Syndrome\" or from the pages of \"The Night We Almost Lost Detroit,\" an explosion ripped off the outer wall and roof of the building holding the 41-year-old General Electric reactor. Late Sunday night, a second building blew into pieces. In both explosions, the reactors were not yet breached.But several of the reactors were spewing a deadly cocktail of assorted radioisotopes, including iodine-131, cesium-137, xenon and krypton carried aloft with the radioactive steam.Almost instantly, postings on thousands of websites and blogs pontificated on the importance of every shred of information, real or imagined.Some presumed experts talked of curies, rads, becquerels, sieverts, mrems and other terms describing the escaping radiation, using measurement terms that haven't been used in years or had absolutely no relevance to a leaking reactor. Rarely did they explain what these numbers meant.Some postings were criminally absurd and flat-out wrong.One map that went viral showed color-coded plumes of radiation moving eastward across the Pacific and the prediction that radiation levels measuring 3,000 rads would reach the Aleutian Island chain in three days. Levels of 1,500 rads will hit the northern coast of British Columbia within a week and western North American \"from Alaska to the Baja tip in 10 days, with radiation levels of 750 rads,'' the posting warned.These numbers, which would kill or sicken quickly, have absolutely no basis in fact at all. And, according to a radiation expert at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, they are more typical of the levels that might occur after a nuclear attack.In fact, Japanese nuclear officials have said repeatedly that they're dealing with \"a minimal level of radiation that does not harm human health.\"It is good to sometimes be skeptical of government claims. During Three Mile Island, a hydrogen bubble in the damaged reactor was poised to destroy the unit, yet power company and state and federal officials denied the existence of the destructive bubble for days.Some companies were quick to take advantage of such skepticism about the Japanese reports.The Web was bristling with links from stories on the disaster taking readers to sites selling \"Five Person Deluxe Survival Kits,\" \"life-saving\" potassium iodide pills, Swiss Army knifes, tools to turn off leaking gas lines and Geiger counters of all sizes. One site promised, \"Your order can be overnighted to you before the lethal cloud arrives.\"These are ads that are automatically placed by computers and are not set there by the writers or editors.Leading the silliness parade were bloggers who were linking to Cold War civil defense ads from the 1950s showing Tommy the Turtle hiding from a nuclear blast and children being taught to \"duck and cover\" under their school desks.As real facts flowing from Japan fell to a trickle, the vacuum was filled with speculation.For example, meteorologists and their websites argued over the prevailing-wind currents and surface currents from Japan. Some said the winds would quickly carry the radioactive debris to the West Coast in days. Other forecasters, using the same charts, said the wind patterns would widely distribute and dilute any plume of radioactive material before it reached the U.S.Bad information was coming from even trusted sites. The respected Incident and Emergency Center of the International Atomic Energy Agency says it incorrectly reported that four of the damaged reactors were venting.The U.S. government's watchdog of nuclear power plants isn't doing all it can to keep the public calm.At a White House briefing this morning, Gregory Jaczko, the head of the NRC, said power plants in the U.S. are designed to handle all \" significant phenomena,\" including tsunamis, floods and earthquakes. He was asked several times what size quakes U.S. plants are designed to withstand. But each time he flipped the question back to the Japanese crisis, avoiding answering what he was asked.AOL News called the NRC press office and was told that each site is built to a different seismic activity standard. But when we requested a list of the earthquake design limits for each plant under NRC control, that information isn't available, was the official reply.Asked what the range of protective limits was, he said he didn't think that information was available.What makes this information important is that the Japanese plants that are in crisis were designed to withstand a 7.9 quake, not the 8.9 monster that hit them. Government officials in the U.S. were doing their best to downplay the imminent danger on this side of the Pacific.Rumors spread wildly on the availability and shipments of potassium iodide tablets, which is pretty much the only preventive medication to neutralize the effect of radioactive poisoning that targets the thyroid gland and could eventually cause cancer.When AOL News questioned the Departments of Energy and Homeland Security on Saturday, spokesmen said that none of the medication -- also called KI -- has been shipped anywhere because there is \"no apparent need.\" Officials questioned on the West Coast said the same.Oregon and Washington state health officials told AOL News that if it were needed, the radiation-blocking agent could quickly be shipped in from strategic stockpiles maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.An official in California echoed the comments but added that there were already quantities of KI in the state because there are four operating power stations at two sites.The federal agencies said that they \"continue to work to assess what is a very serious and fluid situation\" but insisted that no one expected any \"meaningful effects on the U.S. homeland.''Oregon and Washington say they continue to use continuous-reading Environmental Protection Agency radiation detectors to monitor levels. This is the same EPA system that first detected radiation from the Chernobyl accident at ground level on the West Coast one week after the meltdown in Ukraine.State officials said risks to residents of both states are minimal given the current size of the release from the Japanese reactors and the distance from the West Coast. But they will continue to closely watch the radiation detectors until the Japanese reactors are shut down. ||||| After a once-in-300-years earthquake, the Japanese have been keeping cool amid the chaos, organizing an enormous relief and rescue operation, and generally earning the world's admiration. We wish we could say the same for the reaction in the U.S., where the troubles at Japan's nuclear reactors have produced an overreaction about the risks of modern life and technology. \n \n Part of the problem is the lack of media proportion about the disaster itself. The quake and tsunami have killed hundreds, and probably thousands, with tens of billions of dollars in damage. The energy released by the quake off Sendei is equivalent to about 336 megatons of TNT, or 100 more megatons than last year's quake in Chile and thousands of times the yield of the nuclear explosion at Hiroshima. The scale of the tragedy is epic. \n \n Yet the bulk of U.S. media coverage has focused on a nuclear accident whose damage has so far been limited and contained to the plant sites. In simple human terms, the natural destruction of Earth and sea have far surpassed any errors committed by man. \n \n Editorial Board Member Mary Kissel explains the Japanese response to the quake. \n \n Given the incomplete news reports, it is impossible to say how much worse the nuclear damage will be. Unlike the Soviets at Chernobyl, the Japanese have been taking sensible precautions like evacuating people near the plants and handing out iodine pills even if they may never be needed. These precautions increase public worry, but better to take them even if they prove to be unnecessary. \n \n We will have plenty of time to dissect events at the reactors and the safety lessons going forward. William Tucker provides some useful context nearby, and one crucial point is that the containment walls seem to have held. These walls are designed to withstand quakes and explosions, and it is good news if they have done so. The crisis seems to have been triggered by the failure of diesel generators that provided electricity to cool the reactors once they were shut down. Mr. Tucker explains that this weakness has been corrected in new nuclear plant designs. \n \n We have no special brief for nuclear power over any other energy source. Our view is that it should compete with other sources on a market basis, without subsidies or government loan guarantees. Every energy source has risks and economic externalities, whether they are noise and bird kills (wind), huge land requirements (solar), rig explosions and tanker spills (oil), or mining accidents (coal). \n \n But more than other energy sources, nuclear plants have had their costs increased by artificial political obstacles and delay. The U.S. hasn't built a new nuclear plant since 1979, after the Three Mile Island meltdown, even as older nuclear plants continue to provide 20% of the nation's electricity. \n \n Enlarge Image Close JIJI PRESS/AFP/Getty Images An aerial photo shows the quake-damaged Fukushima Dai-Ni nuclear power plant. \n \n The Tennessee Valley Authority is a couple of years away from completing a reactor at Watts Bar after years of effort. Proposals for 20 new reactors to be built over the next 15 to 20 years are in various stages of review in the multiyear approval process at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, with two each in Georgia and South Carolina at the front of the line. But the much-ballyhooed \"nuclear renaissance\" is a long way off, and it will be longer after events in Japan. \n \n Our larger point is less about nuclear power than how we react as a society to inevitable disasters, both natural and man-made. Because a plane crashes, we don't stop flying. Because an oil rig explodes in the Gulf, we don't (or at least we shouldn't) stop drilling for oil. And because the Challenger space shuttle blew up, we didn't stop shuttle flights\u2014though we do seem to have lost much of our national will for further manned space exploration. We should learn from the Japanese nuclear crisis, not let it feed a political panic over nuclear power in general. \n \n *** \n \n The paradox of material and technological progress is that we seem to become more risk-averse the safer it makes us. The more comfortable we become, the less eager we are to take the risks that are the only route to future progress. The irony is that one reason Japan has survived this catastrophic event as well as it has is its great material development and wealth. \n \n Modern civilization is in the daily business of measuring and mitigating risk, but its advance requires that we continue to take risk. It would compound Japan's tragedy if the lesson America learns is that we should pursue the illusory and counterproductive goal of eliminating all risk. ||||| Even while thousands of people are reported dead or missing, whole neighborhoods lie in ruins, and gas and oil fires rage out of control, press coverage of the Japanese earthquake has quickly settled on the troubles at two nuclear reactors as the center of the catastrophe. \n \n Rep. Ed Markey (D., Mass.), a longtime opponent of nuclear power, has warned of \"another Chernobyl\" and predicted \"the same thing could happen here.\" In response, he has called for an immediate suspension of licensing procedures for the Westinghouse AP1000, a \"Generation III\" reactor that has been laboring through design review at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for seven years. \n \n Author William Tucker explains why the danger is limited at Japan's nuclear reactors. \n \n Before we respond with such panic, though, it would be useful to review exactly what is happening in Japan and what we have to fear from it. \n \n The core of a nuclear reactor operates at about 550 degrees Fahrenheit, well below the temperature of a coal furnace and only slightly hotter than a kitchen oven. If anything unusual occurs, the control rods immediately drop, shutting off the nuclear reaction. You can't have a \"runaway reactor,\" nor can a reactor explode like a nuclear bomb. A commercial reactor is to a bomb what Vaseline is to napalm. Although both are made from petroleum jelly, only one of them has potentially explosive material. \n \n Once the reactor has shut down, there remains \"decay heat\" from traces of other radioactive isotopes. This can take more than a week to cool down, and the rods must be continually bathed in cooling waters to keep them from overheating. \n \n On all Generation II reactors\u2014the ones currently in operation\u2014the cooling water is circulated by electric pumps. The new Generation III reactors such as the AP1000 have a simplified \"passive\" cooling system where the water circulates by natural convection with no pumping required. \n \n If the pumps are knocked out in a Generation II reactor\u2014as they were at Fukushima Daiichi by the tsunami\u2014the water in the cooling system can overheat and evaporate. The resulting steam increases internal pressure that must be vented. There was a small release of radioactive steam at Three Mile Island in 1979, and there have also been a few releases at Fukushima Daiichi. These produce radiation at about the level of one dental X-ray in the immediate vicinity and quickly dissipate. \n \n Editorial Board Member Mary Kissel explains the Japanese response to the quake. \n \n If the coolant continues to evaporate, the water level can fall below the level of the fuel rods, exposing them. This will cause a meltdown, meaning the fuel rods melt to the bottom of the steel pressure vessel. \n \n Early speculation was that in a case like this the fuel might continue melting right through the steel and perhaps even through the concrete containment structure\u2014the so-called China syndrome, where the fuel would melt all the way to China. But Three Mile Island proved this doesn't happen. The melted fuel rods simply aren't hot enough to melt steel or concrete. \n \n The decay heat must still be absorbed, however, and as a last-ditch effort the emergency core cooling system can be activated to flood the entire containment structure with water. This will do considerable damage to the reactor but will prevent any further steam releases. The Japanese have now reportedly done this using seawater in at least two of the troubled reactors. These reactors will never be restarted. \n \n None of this amounts to \"another Chernobyl.\" The Chernobyl reactor had two crucial design flaws. First, it used graphite (carbon) instead of water to \"moderate\" the neutrons, which makes possible the nuclear reaction. The graphite caught fire in April 1986 and burned for four days. Water does not catch fire. \n \n Second, Chernobyl had no containment structure. When the graphite caught fire, it spouted a plume of radioactive smoke that spread across the globe. A containment structure would have both smothered the fire and contained the radioactivity. \n \n If a meltdown does occur in Japan, it will be a disaster for the Tokyo Electric Power Company but not for the general public. Whatever steam releases occur will have a negligible impact. Researchers have spent 30 years trying to find health effects from the steam releases at Three Mile Island and have come up with nothing. With all the death, devastation and disease now threatening tens of thousands in Japan, it is trivializing and almost obscene to spend so much time worrying about damage to a nuclear reactor. \n \n What the Japanese earthquake has proved is that even the oldest containment structures can withstand the impact of one of the largest earthquakes in recorded history. The problem has been with the electrical pumps required to operate the cooling system. It would be tragic if the result of the Japanese accident were to prevent development of Generation III reactors, which eliminate this design flaw. \n \n Mr. Tucker is author of \"Terrestrial Energy: How Nuclear Power Will Lead the Green Revolution and End America's Energy Odyssey\" (Bartleby Press, 2010).",

    "document": "When Lady Gaga was announced as the performer of this year\u2019s Super Bowl halftime show, many of her fans were curious if the singer would get political during her 13-minute set. But it\u2019s possible that Gaga actually managed to sneak in a fairly subversive political moment without most viewers noticing. \n \n NFL senior VP of programming Mark Quenzel told Billboard of Gaga\u2019s plans: \u201cWe have no discussions about her or with her that have to do with the election, or the president. What we say to every artist, very clearly, and they all buy in: the Super Bowl halftime is the biggest musical event of the year, and it\u2019s also a communal event for fans, the Super Bowl itself. People get together as families, as friends. It\u2019s a unifying day for people built around the biggest sporting event in the world.\u201d \n \n Gaga herself responded to that remark with this: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know if I will succeed in unifying America. You\u2019ll have to ask America when it\u2019s over. But the only statements that I\u2019ll be making during the halftime show are the ones that I\u2019ve been consistently making throughout my career. \u2026 I believe in a passion for inclusion. I believe in the spirit of equality, and the spirit of this country as one of love and compassion and kindness. So my performance will have both those philosophies.\u201d \n \n All that said, Gaga opened her set with \u201cGod Bless America\u201c and then immediately segued into Woody Guthrie\u2019s Americana classic \u201cThis Land Is Your Land\u201d\u2014which, if you\u2019ve ever heard the full version, is a little edgier than you might expect. It has also become an anthem for protestors fighting against Trump\u2019s proposed immigration bans and border walls. The lyrics, in full, read: \n \n This land is your land \n \n This land is my land From California to the New York island; From the red wood forest to the Gulf Stream waters This land was made for you and Me. \n \n As I was walking that ribbon of highway, I saw above me that endless skyway: I saw below me that golden valley: This land was made for you and me. \n \n I've roamed and rambled and I followed my footsteps To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts; And all around me a voice was sounding: This land was made for you and me. \n \n When the sun came shining, and I was strolling, And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling, As the fog was lifting a voice was chanting: This land was made for you and me. \n \n As I went walking I saw a sign there And on the sign it said \"No Trespassing.\" But on the other side it didn't say nothing, That side was made for you and me. \n \n In the shadow of the steeple I saw my people, By the relief office I seen my people; As they stood there hungry, I stood there asking Is this land made for you and me? \n \n Nobody living can ever stop me, As I go walking that freedom highway; Nobody living can ever make me turn back This land was made for you and me. \n \n According to Guthrie\u2019s son, Arlo, Woody wrote the song in anger as a response to \u201cGod Bless America,\u201d written by Irving Berlin, which Guthrie hated. We don\u2019t often sing the latter, angrier verses of This Land in schools\u2014nor did Gaga during the show. But as Arlo told The New Yorker in 2004: \u201cHe wanted me to know what he originally wrote, so it wouldn\u2019t be forgotten.\u201d The New Yorker further explains Guthrie\u2019s political evolution: \n \n Guthrie\u2019s inchoate socialist leanings grew into a deep commitment to the labor movement and to the social and political adventurism of the American Communist Party. (Guthrie never joined the Party\u2014his independence was such that he \u201cwas not affiliated with anything,\u201d according to his sister Mary Jo; he did follow the Party line, however, down to belittling Roosevelt as a warmonger during the period of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, and he wrote a column called \u201cWoody Sez,\u201d in hillbilly dialect, for the C.P.U.S.A. organs People\u2019s World and Daily Worker.) The first of Guthrie\u2019s three wives, Mary, lamented his politicization as \u201chis downfall as an entertainer,\u201d and she had a point: the more he focussed on rousing the masses, the less he pleased the crowd. Guthrie\u2019s modest popular following diminished; at the same time, through politics, he found his voice. \n \n Gaga no doubt knew exactly what she was doing when she picked that song to open her performance\u2014and though she may have left the edgier verses out, its inclusion still served as something of dog whistle to the protestors who have been singing it in the street over the past few weeks. \n \n VIDEO: The Greatest Super Bowl Commercials of All-Time ||||| Photo \n \n Lady Gaga went for one big, glittering, diverse party with her Super Bowl halftime show. \u201cWe\u2019re here to make you feel good,\u201d she declared mid-set. At her N.F.L. news conference, she had promised a statement of \u201cinclusion,\u201d an upbeat and uncontroversial stance, and she made good on it as she began her set, singing a few lines each of \u201cGod Bless America\u201d and \u201cThis Land Is Your Land\u201d and reciting the \u201cone nation indivisible\u201d conclusion of the Pledge of Allegiance. \n \n Wearing a shiny, silvery, big-shouldered sci-fi bodysuit and matching high-heeled boots, with a glittery mask painted around her eyes, Lady Gaga was lowered through the air, on suspension cables, into NRG Stadium in Houston, showing off a trapeze-like flip. And she started belting her hits, with a nod to the local audience: \u201cPoker Face\u201d announced, \u201cI want to hold \u2019em like they do in Texas.\u201d \n \n One of those hits was \u201cBorn This Way,\u201d her dance-floor anthem of self-acceptance for all kinds of people. \u201cYou\u2019re black, white, beige, chola descent/You\u2019re Lebanese, you\u2019re orient,\u201d she sang, and later, \u201cNo matter gay, straight, or bi/Lesbian, transgendered life/I\u2019m on the right track baby/I was born to survive.\u201d It was doubtless the first time the word \u201ctransgendered\u201d had been sung at a Super Bowl halftime show. Dozens of dancers of multiple skin tones and genders joined her, matching her moves in exultant line dances and embodying her message of empowerment as a shared celebration. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Louder Newsletter Every week, stay on top of the latest in pop and jazz with reviews, interviews, podcasts and more from The New York Times music critics.

It was a megamix of her songs spanning her career, from her 2008 debut single, \u201cJust Dance,\u201d to \u201cMillion Reasons,\u201d the power ballad from her 2016 album, \u201cJoanne.\u201d She sang \u201cMillion Reasons\u201d from a piano as people waving orange electric torches made patterns that radiated across the football field; that was her relatively still point in a fiercely athletic performance. \u201cThe Super Bowl is what champions are made of,\u201d she declared as \u201cBad Romance\u201d revved up. \n \n Lady Gaga has proudly presented herself as the continuation of generations of song-and-dance showbiz troupers, a tradition of fervent effort and well-rehearsed spectacle delivered with joy. She sang with hardworking gusto throughout the set, even as she covered considerable yardage strutting and kicking, prancing and gesticulating, pumping her hips and shaking hands with fans. \n \n It was a show of shiny costumes and big smiles, of a huge group of dancers all sharing the same moves, an outpouring of energy that was eager to please everybody. Lady Gaga ended it with one last strut, up a ramp, and a self-congratulatory gesture that has been used by both rappers and an ex-president: a microphone drop, earned with sweat. ||||| Tonight, Lady Gaga literally took a leap of faith (via some very trustworthy suspension cables) when she opened her Super Bowl halftime performance with a riff on patriotic classics. After her epic (and already memed) dive toward the stage, our Lady fearlessly sang her anthe, \"Born This Way,\" resplendent in crystal eye makeup and a glittering ensemble. If ever there were a time for \"Yas Gaga,\" this was it. \n \n So I tweeted this: \n \n And was almost immediately met with this: \n \n I'm sorry \u2014 but did the trolls on Twitter miss the memo? \n \n Clearly, many people watching didn't realize that the song \"Born This Way\" is designed for the LGBTQ community. If you've been to a Pride march in the past four years, you know a thing or two about dancing to \"Born This Way\" while you're surrounded by a ton of glitter, bare skin, and glorious, rainbow solidarity. Let's just be clear here, though: Performing a song that's so blatantly gay in front of an audience that includes Mike Pence, one of the most anti-LGBTQ politicians today , is absolutely political \u2014 especially when it contains lyrics like \"No matter gay, straight, or bi, lesbian, transgender life.\" (P.S.: According to USA Today , that was \"likely\" be the first time the word \"transgender\" was said onstage at a Super Bowl.) \n \n Furthermore, as our friends at The Hive pointed out, the Woody Guthrie song \"This Land Is Your Land\" is inherently activistic. Gaga omitted certain lyrics from the piece, which The Hive printed for your convenience. Here's a sampling: \n \n As I went walking I saw a sign there / And on the sign it said \"No Trespassing.\" / But on the other side it didn't say nothing, / That side was made for you and me. Nobody living can ever stop me, / As I go walking that freedom highway; / Nobody living can ever make me turn back / This land was made for you and me. \n \n \"This land was made for you and me,\" she sang, in the same weekend that Donald Trump's executive order \u2014 one that was designed to fulfill his campaign promise of banning Muslims from entering our country \u2014 was essentially (if temporarily) rendered moot by a judge in Washington state. \n \n The Super Bowl is a massive display of capitalism, contracts, and fragile masculinity. We can only assume that Lady Gaga had to deal with these constraints as she planned her performance \u2014 especially following the accusations Beyonc\u00e9 received last year for displaying black pride on a national stage. So in this case, rather than not show up at all, she allowed her art to be the activism. She played within the confines and outwitted them as best she could. It's up to us to read between the lines. \n \n Related: The Black Panther Party, Explained by a Former Black Panther \n \n Editor's Note: This piece was updated to insert lyrics from the Lady Gaga song mentioned. ||||| 5 Best Ski Lodges In The U.S. A look at five of the very best ski lodges in the United States. \n \n Five Must-See Destinations In ParisWithin the 41 square miles of Paris, France there are over 60 main attractions for visitors to discover ranging from Museums, Churches, Monuments and Squares as well as examples of contemporary and traditional architecture.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Despite anticipation that Lady Gaga would make some kind of political statement during the Super Bowl halftime show, the pop star appeared to play nice, a performance of the LGBT-friendly \"Born This Way\" aside. Even prominent conservatives hailed her \"apolitical\" show, the Washington Post notes, with tweeted praise from the likes of Fox News, Marco Rubio, and even Ivanka Trump. But Vanity Fair reports that an \"edgy political statement\" may have been a \"dog whistle\" for President Trump protesters with Gaga's choice of opening songs, a double hit of Irving Berlin's \"God Bless America\" followed by a portion of \"This Land Is Your Land\"\u2014and the latter Woody Guthrie song is where Gaga's hidden message may lie. Guthrie's son Arlo has said his dad wrote \"This Land\" as a biting response to Berlin's patriotic song, and in the 1944 version the elder Guthrie recorded on his guitar\u2014he owned one sporting a \"This Machine Kills Fascists\" sticker\u2014the fourth verse contains some interesting (and timely Trump-tied lyrics) that have since fallen out of the versions we hear today. To wit: \"There was a big high wall there that tried to stop me / The sign was painted, said 'Private Property' / But on the backside, it didn\u2019t say nothing.\" Vanity Fair notes that Trump protesters have been crooning the song at rallies lately, and Arlo Guthrie and other singers like Bruce Springsteen keep the original lyrics in when they perform the song.

    "document": "WASHINGTON \u2013 EPA and Magnolia Waco Properties, LLC, which does business as Magnolia Homes, have reached a settlement to resolve alleged violations of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Lead Renovation, Repair and Painting Rule (RRP Rule), related to home renovations conducted without adequate lead paint protections as depicted on the television program Fixer Upper. Under the terms of the settlement, Magnolia will take steps to ensure compliance with lead-based paint regulations in future renovation projects, address lead-based paint hazards at high-risk homes in Waco, Texas, and educate the public to lead-based paint hazards and appropriate renovation procedures. \n \n Overview of Company \n \n Magnolia Waco Properties, LLC, which does business as Magnolia Homes, is a renovation firm that remodels homes in the Waco, Texas area. The firm specializes in renovations that require extensive remodeling of older homes while preserving historical design elements. The activities of Magnolia and similar renovation firms came to EPA\u2019s attention from their depiction on popular television shows. Magnolia\u2019s renovations were depicted on the HGTV series \u201cFixer Upper\u201d and regularly viewed by well over 3 million households. \n \n Top of Page \n \n Violations \n \n EPA\u2019s Residential Property Renovation Rule, also known as the \u201cRenovation, Remodeling and Painting Rule\u201d (RRP Rule), implements a provision that Congress added to the Toxic Substances Control Act to ensure that home renovations would not expose occupants to dangerous levels of lead from the lead-based paint often contained in homes built before 1978. The RRP Rule requires firms performing renovations for compensation in such homes to use specific precautions, including lead safe work practices, to reduce the risk of exposure to lead, unless the firm documents that testing of building components prior to renovation demonstrated less than the regulated concentration of lead in surface coatings on the components. \n \n Video footage of Magnolia\u2019s renovations of older homes appearing in several seasons of \u201cFixer Upper\u201d reviewed by EPA did not depict the lead-safe work practices normally required by the RRP Rule. After EPA contacted Magnolia with concerns about the company\u2019s compliance, Magnolia took immediate steps to ensure compliance with the RRP Rule, including to obtain RRP certification and training for the firm and its staff and to ensure active compliance across all ongoing renovation projects. \n \n EPA\u2019s review of information it obtained with Magnolia\u2019s cooperation found evidence of noncompliance at renovations of 33 properties. Among the violations subsequently alleged by EPA were that Magnolia did not comply with the following requirements and precautions of the RRP Rule: \n \n Obtain firm certification from EPA before performing renovations covered by the RRP Rule; \n \n Assign a certified renovator to such renovations; \n \n Provide home owners or occupants with an approved pamphlet about lead-based paint hazards prior to the renovation; \n \n Post signs to clearly define the work area and warn people to remain outside that area; \n \n Comply with the RRP Rule\u2019s work practice standards, such as closing doors and windows to the interior work areas, covering floor surfaces, ducts and other openings to work areas with plastic sheeting, and covering the ground with plastic sheeting to capture falling paint chips from exterior renovations. \n \n Magnolia cooperated with EPA throughout the Agency\u2019s inquiry, volunteering information about its renovation activities and proposing to undertake innovative projects to reduce the prevalence of childhood lead-poisoning in its community and to increase awareness of lead-based paint safety issues associated with renovations in older homes. \n \n Top of Page \n \n Injunctive Relief \n \n In addition to a civil penalty, this settlement includes relief focused in three areas: compliance management of Magnolia\u2019s own renovation operations, outreach about lead-based paint safety to Magnolia\u2019s national audience, and the reduction of lead-based paint hazards in Magnolia\u2019s local community. \n \n Magnolia took immediate steps to ensure the compliance of its own operations with the RRP Rule by becoming an EPA certified renovation firm, obtaining training and renovator certification for staff, and bringing active renovations into compliance. In this settlement, however, Magnolia took a step further in its commitment to compliance by implementing a compliance management program, in which it adopted an enhanced renovation recordkeeping checklist for use by its own staff and by subcontractors doing regulated work and agreed to compile periodic reports to EPA on its compliance implementation. \n \n Magnolia also sought to improve the public\u2019s appreciation for the serious hazards of lead-based paint contained in older homes and the precautions necessary to reduce those hazards. First, Magnolia spoke about lead based-paint on an episode of \u201cFixer Upper\u201d and depicted some of the steps renovation firms must take to minimize those hazards in a segment of its March 21, 2018 episode of \u201cFixer Upper.\u201d During and after the broadcast of that episode, a \u201cFixer Upper\u201d co-star Chip Gaines sought to amplify the message about lead-based paint safety with messages to his Twitter followers about the importance of using a professional\u2019s help to check for lead paint and a link to a website with information about lead safety and the RRP Rule. Second, Magnolia proposed a brief stand-alone video further discussing lead-based paint and the RRP Rule to be hosted on its webpage and promoted on social media. Magnolia agreed to post the video within three months of executing this settlement. In the video, Chip Gaines will discuss lead safety and depict some of the safe work practices required by the RRP Rule. \n \n Magnolia also looked for ways to make a concrete difference in its local community. To that end, the company will perform a supplemental environmental project (SEP) to abate lead-based paint hazards in homes or child-occupied facilities in the Waco, Texas area. A significant portion of Waco\u2019s housing stock was built before 1978, and at least one neighborhood has had historically higher exposure to lead-based paint and a higher percentage of elevated blood lead levels in children than the statewide and national averages. Magnolia\u2019s SEP, which will be performed with an independent abatement firm, will reduce the risk of exposure to lead-based paint by targeting the most likely sources of lead-based paint hazards in residences, such as window and door replacement, removal of lead-based paint and dust, permanent enclosure and encapsulation, and replacement of lead-based paint surfaces and fixtures. Magnolia has committed to spend $160,000 on the SEP. \n \n Top of Page \n \n Pollutant Impacts \n \n Even though lead-based paint was banned in 1978, it still remains in many homes and apartments across the country. According to HUD\u2019s American Healthy Homes Survey, which was conducted from June 2005 through March 2006, an estimated 37.1 million homes \u2013 or 34.9 percent of all homes nationwide \u2013 have lead-based paint somewhere in the building. An estimated 34.4 million of these homes were built before 1978. \n \n Top of Page \n \n Health Effects and Environmental Benefits \n \n Lead dust can occur when lead paint deteriorates or is disrupted during home renovation and remodeling activities. Lead exposure can cause a range of health problems, from behavioral disorders and learning disabilities to seizures and death, putting young children at the greatest risk because their nervous systems are still developing. EPA enforces the RRP Rule and other lead rules to protect children and others who are vulnerable to exposure to lead dust that can cause lead poisoning. \n \n Top of Page \n \n Civil Penalty \n \n Magnolia will pay a civil penalty of $40,000. \n \n Top of Page \n \n Amos Presler, Attorney \n \n Waste and Chemical Enforcement Division \n \n Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance \n \n presler.amos@epa.gov \n \n (202) 564-1076 \n \n Top of Page ||||| Photo: HGTV \n \n Fame has finally turned on HGTV\u2019s Fixer Upper stars Chip and Joanna Gaines. The pair\u2019s company, Magnolia Homes, will pay $40,000 to the EPA for alleged lead-paint violations. They are alleged to have not taken the appropriate precautions while renovating homes that contained lead paint in Waco, Texas, for their show. The EPA says that the rules were allegedly violated in 33 different homes, but at least they probably look a lot better. \n \n The violations were noticed because apparently someone at the EPA saw it. The agency said in a statement they had witnessed the violations when they reviewed several seasons of the show, because apparently the EPA has a whole department that\u2019s just people with hangovers binge-watching home-renovation shows with the rest of us. In addition to the fine, Magnolia will pay to produce some lead-awareness bonus content for their web site and social-media accounts. The video will star Chip Gaines and aim to to make fans aware of how to be lead-safe, and hopefully it\u2019ll be ready in time for July 5. ||||| Chip and Joanna Gaines, HGTV\u2019s husband-wife Fixer Upper team, have agreed to pay a $40,000 fine by the EPA for the improper use of lead-based paint in their renovations. The couple, who do business as Magnolia Homes, reached a settlement in a case that could have cost them $556,000 in fines. \n \n In a settlement \u201cinformation sheet\u201d posted on the EPA\u2019s website (read it here), the agency notes that the \u201cactivities of Magnolia and similar renovation firms came to EPA\u2019s attention from their depiction on popular television shows. Magnolia\u2019s renovations were depicted on the HGTV series \u2018Fixer Upper\u2019 and regularly viewed by well over 3 million households.\u201d \n \n The EPA says Magnolia engaged in \u201chome renovations conducted without adequate lead paint protections as depicted on the television program Fixer Upper.\u201d The series recently completed its fifth and final season on HGTV. \n \n In addition to the $40,000 fine, the settlement requires Chip Gaines to produce and release an educational video highlighting the dangers of lead-based paint within 90 days.

Well you can kiss him goodbye: The robo-cabs are coming! \n \n Uber prides itself on being disruptive to the taxi industry by providing personal transport service without all those pesky regulations. Now it\u2019s disrupting itself: On Monday, the company announced a partnership with Carnegie Mellon University to build a robotics research lab in Pittsburgh. TechCrunch reports that the goal is to create a fleet of driverless, robot cabs. It\u2019s further proof that Uber cares so much about its drivers. \n \n As it turns out, the move may be a response to a warning from a Google exec who sits on Uber\u2019s board: Google is creating its own ride-hailing app, and the cabs could be self-driving. \n \n Until now, Google has been Uber\u2019s tech-industry BFF, investing $258 million in the ride-hailing app, sharing Google Maps, and lending a C-suiter to Uber\u2019s board of directors.

The center will focus on the development of key long-term technologies that advance Uber\u2019s mission of bringing safe, reliable transportation to everyone, everywhere. \n \n \u201cWe are excited to join the community of Pittsburgh and partner with the experts at CMU, whose breadth and depth of technical expertise, particularly in robotics, are unmatched. As a global leader in urban transportation, we have the unique opportunity to invest in leading edge technologies to enable the safe and efficient movement of people and things at giant scale. This collaboration and the creation of the Uber Advanced Technologies Center represent an important investment in building for the long term of Uber.\u201d \n \n The partnership will provide a forum for Uber technology leaders to work closely with CMU faculty, staff, and students \u2014 both on campus and at the National Robotics Engineering Center (NREC) \u2014 to do research and development, primarily in the areas of mapping and vehicle safety and autonomy technology. \n \n \u2014Jeff Holden, Uber Chief Product Officer \n \n The agreement will also include funding from Uber for faculty chairs and graduate fellowships, recognizing and supporting Carnegie Mellon\u2019s world-renowned faculty and attracting the best and brightest graduate students. \n \n \u201cUber is a rapidly growing company known for its innovative technology that is radically improving access to transportation for millions of global citizens. CMU is renowned for innovations that transform lives. We look forward to partnering with Uber as they build out the Advanced Technologies Center and to working together on real-world applications, which offer very interesting new challenges at the intersections of technology, mobility, and human interactions.\u201d \n \n \u2014Andrew Moore, Dean of the School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University \n \n The Center will aid in local job creation and further the well-deserved reputation of the Steel City for its growing innovation sector. Uber and CMU will hold an event in Pittsburgh to formally kick off the partnership in the coming weeks. \n \n \u201cI am pleased to welcome Uber to the growing list of leading technology companies that are coming to Pittsburgh to help invent the future.

They say the company has hired talent from Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Robotics Institute, including lead engineering and commercialization experts. \n \n No one at Carnegie Mellon or Uber agreed to discuss the deal on the record but an announcement should be forthcoming. Update: Uber published a blog post today outlining its partnership with Carnegie Mellon University, confirming our reporting. \n \n Sources tell us Uber is hiring more than fifty senior scientists from Carnegie Mellon as well as from the National Robotics Engineering Center, a CMU-affiliated research entity. Carnegie Mellon, home of the Mars Rover and other high-profile robotics projects, declined to comment at this time, as did scientists mentioned by our source. Uber has \u201ccleaned out\u201d the Robotics Institute, said the source. \n \n The source also noted that most of these technologies came through a \u201cmassive\u201d military spending push over the past decade and should net the university millions in IP licensing fees. \n \n Uber will be developing the core technology, the vehicles, and associated infrastructure at this Pittsburgh facility, according to sources. They have already hired a number of employees and made moves to outfit them with software, including a multi-hundred-thousand dollar investment in third-party engineering workstations. \n \n In the past, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has said he would replace human drivers with self-driving cars. The decision to run the facility in Pittsburgh makes perfect sense, given the proximity to CMU and the potential secrecy afforded by moving research out of Silicon Valley. \n \n In a related story, Bloomberg Business is reporting that Google is looking into creating an on-demand car service of its own, which is very interesting considering Uber\u2019s interest in automated vehicles. It also raises questions about Google\u2019s David Drummond maintaining a spot on Uber\u2019s board. Google has integrated Uber into its Google Maps products and has taken an investment in Uber via its Google Ventures arm. \n \n No specific plans for a roll-out date or goals for Uber\u2019s automated driving efforts were mentioned. The company recently raised $4 billion in equity and debt including $1.6 billion in convertible debt earlier this month. This follows a $1.4 billion Series D funding round over the summer as well as another $1.2 round in December. The company is now valued at $41 billion. \n \n Updated to add reports of Google competing with Uber. ||||| SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email \n \n Photographer: Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post via Getty Images Photographer: Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post via Getty Images \n \n Uber faces an ever-growing cast of adversaries that includes dubious regulators, litigious drivers, hostile members of the press, and some well-funded rivals. But the most significant threat to the app-based transportation company may be much closer to home: one of its biggest investors, Google. \n \n Google Ventures, the search giant's venture capital arm, invested $258 million in Uber in August 2013. It was Google Ventures' largest investment deal ever, and the company put more money into Uber's next funding round less than a year later. Back then, it was easy for observers to imagine Google teaming closely with Uber, or even one day acquiring it. David Drummond, Google\u2019s chief legal officer and senior vice president of corporate development, joined the Uber board of directors in 2013 and has served on it ever since. \n \n Now there are signs that the companies are more likely to be ferocious competitors than allies. Google is preparing to offer its own ride-hailing service, most likely in conjunction with its long-in-development driverless car project. Drummond has informed Uber's board of this possibility, according to a person close to the Uber board, and Uber executives have seen screenshots of what appears to be a Google ride-sharing app that is currently being used by Google employees. This person, who requested not to be named because the talks are private, said the Uber board is now weighing whether to ask Drummond to resign his position as an Uber board member. \n \n Uber is also teaming up with Carnegie Mellon University for a research facility in Pittsburgh, Pa., to develop its own autonomous vehicle technology, the company announced on Monday. (The news was reported earlier by TechCrunch.) \n \n Google has made no secret of its ambitions to revolutionize transportation with autonomous vehicles. Chief Executive Officer Larry Page is said to be personally fascinated by the challenge of making cities operate more efficiently. The company recently said the driverless car technology in development within its Google X research lab is from two to five years from being ready for widespread use. At the Detroit auto show last month, Chris Urmson, the Google executive in charge of the project, articulated one possible scenario in which autonomous vehicles are patrolling neighborhoods to pick up and drop off passengers. \u201cWe're thinking a lot about how in the long-term, this might become useful in people's lives, and there are a lot of ways we can imagine this going,\u201d Urmson said in a conference call with reporters on Jan. 14. \u201cOne is in the direction of the shared vehicle. The technology would be such that you can call up the vehicle and tell it where to go and then have it take you there.\u201d \n \n Those comments, according to the person familiar with deliberations of the Uber's board, have left executives at Uber deeply concerned\u2014for good reason. Google is a deep-pocketed, technically sophisticated competitor, and Uber\u2019s dependence on the search giant goes far beyond capital. Uber\u2019s smartphone applications for drivers and riders are based on Google Maps, which gives Google a fire hose of data about transportation patterns within cities. Uber would be crippled if it lost access to the industry-leading mapping application, and alternatives\u2014 such as AOL's MapQuest, Apple Maps, and a host of regional players\u2014are widely seen as inferior. \n \n Google\u2019s entrance into the ride-sharing market would also leave Uber without a partner in the suddenly plausible future in which cars without steering wheels roam the streets. Uber will either have to develop the technology itself or form an alliance with a company that can if it wants to offer autonomous vehicles within its fleet. Mercedes, Audi, Tesla, and other carmakers have said they are developing driverless cars, though it's not clear that any is as advanced as Google's. \n \n An Uber spokesperson declined to offer a comment for this article. A Google spokesperson also declined to comment, although the company issued a cryptic tweet. \n \n @business We think you'll find Uber and Lyft work quite well. We use them all the time. \u2014 Google (@google) February 2, 2015 \n \n Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s CEO, has publicly discussed what he sees as the inevitability of autonomous taxis, saying they could offer cheaper rides and a true alternative to vehicle ownership. \u201cThe Uber experience is expensive because it\u2019s not just the car but the other dude in the car,\u201d he said at a technology conference in 2014, referring to the expense of paying human drivers. \u201cWhen there\u2019s no other dude in the car, the cost [of taking an Uber] gets cheaper than owning a vehicle.\u201d \n \n There's already an additional sign of a rift between the companies. Last week Google announced it would start presenting data from third party applications inside Google Now, a service that displays useful information prominently on the screen of Android smartphones. Google said it had struck deals to draw data from such apps as Pandora, AirBnb, Zillow, and the ride-sharing service Lyft. The company most obviously missing from that list? Google\u2019s old and possibly former friend, Uber. \n \n (Updates with Uber's Carnegie Mellon announcement in fourth paragraph.)",

    "document": "Spotting native alligators and crocodiles in Florida is common, but anyone who sees a large reptile may want to take a second look -- human-eaters that can grow to 18 feet long and weigh as much as a small car have been found in the Sunshine State. \n \n Using DNA analysis, University of Florida researchers have confirmed the capture of multiple Nile crocodiles in the wild. \n \n The ancient icon eats everything from zebras to small hippos to humans in sub-Saharan Africa. Now three juveniles of the monster crocodile, have been found in South Florida, swimming in the Everglades and relaxing on a house porch in Miami. \n \n The invasive crocodiles were captured between 2000 and 2014, leading UF scientists to analyze their DNA, study their diet and one of the animal's growth. Scientists verified the animals were Nile crocodiles linked to native populations in South Africa, and confirmed the species can survive in Florida -- and potentially thrive, said Kenneth Krysko, herpetology collections manager at the Florida Museum of Natural History on the UF campus. \n \n In other words, there likely are more. \n \n \"The odds that the few of us who study Florida reptiles have found all of the Nile crocs out there is probably unlikely,\" said Krysko, co-author of the study published in April in the Journal of Herpetological Conservation and Biology. \"We know that they can survive in the Florida wilderness for numerous years, we know that they grow quickly here and we know their behavior in their native range, and there is no reason to suggest that would change here in Florida.\" \n \n Nile crocodiles, Crocodylus niloticus, were responsible for at least 480 attacks on people and 123 fatalities in Africa between 2010 and 2014. They are generalist predators and eat a wide variety of prey. In Florida, everything from native birds, fish and mammals to the state's native crocodile and alligator would be fair game for the carnivorous croc. \n \n The study found one juvenile grew nearly 28 percent faster than wild Nile crocodile juveniles from some parts of their native range. \n \n DNA analysis revealed the three similar-size Nile crocodiles were genetically identical, suggesting they were introduced via the same source, but Krysko said the source has not been confirmed. Prior to graduating in 2013, former UF doctoral student and co-author Matthew Shirley extensively sampled DNA of live Nile crocodiles housed in U.S. zoos, including Florida. The DNA of the three crocodiles did not match any of those Shirley sampled, suggesting they were either acquired by a permitted source later, or introduced by someone without a permit. \n \n Study scientists note that over the last decade, large groups of Nile crocodiles have been imported from South Africa and Madagascar for display at places like Disney's Animal Kingdom and to supply Florida's flourishing pet trade, with the latter being the most likely introduction pathway, according to the study. \n \n While there is currently no evidence of an established population, study scientists recommend a scientific risk assessment to evaluate the potential for Nile crocodiles to breed and spread across the state. According to the study, Florida's Atlantic coast and the entire Gulf of Mexico coastline provide favorable climate for Nile crocodiles. \n \n Florida's subtropical climate is one reason the state has the world's largest number of invasive species -- from the Burmese python that has infested the Everglades to the Cuban tree frog, which has been found as far north as Jacksonville on the East Coast and as far north as Cedar Key on the Gulf Coast. \n \n \"My hope as a biologist is that the introduction of Nile crocodiles in Florida opens everyone's eyes to the problem of invasive species that we have here in our state,\" Krysko said. \"Now here's another one, but this time it isn't just a tiny house gecko from Africa.\" ||||| FORT LAUDERDALE \u2014 Step aside, Burmese python \u2014 you may no longer be Florida's scariest invasive species. \n \n Researchers have confirmed that three Nile crocodiles were captured near Miami, and they say it's possible more of the man-eating reptiles are still out there, although no one can say for sure. \n \n The big question now: How did they get to Florida? \n \n \"They didn't swim from Africa,\" University of Florida herpetologist Kenneth Krysko said. \"But we really don't know how they got into the wild.\" \n \n Krysko and his co-authors just published a paper showing that DNA testing proved the three animals captured in 2009, 2011 and 2014 are Nile crocs, a species whose males grow to over 16 feet long and weigh upward of 1,600 pounds. \n \n Nile crocs are believed to be responsible for up to 200 fatalities annually in their native sub-Saharan Africa. Compare that with an annual average of six reported shark attack deaths globally. \n \n Krysko, who works at UF's Florida Museum of Natural History, said the captured crocodiles matched genetically, meaning they are related to one another, but didn't match Nile crocs kept at Disney's Animal Kingdom and other licensed Florida attractions. \n \n That means they probably were brought to Florida illegally by an unlicensed reptile collector who either didn't contain them properly, allowing them to escape, or, more sinisterly, planted them in the Everglades in hopes they would multiply. \n \n The Nile croc, if it became established in the Everglades, would pose another invasive threat to its teetering ecosystem. Through crossbreeding, they could endanger the smaller, less aggressive American crocodiles, which have never been responsible for a confirmed human death in the U.S. \n \n About 1,000 American crocodiles live in South Florida, mostly in mangroves and estuaries. Any hybrids would degrade the genetic integrity of the endangered American variety. \n \n Nile crocs also are known to attack livestock, which would be bad news for cattle farms that border the Everglades. \n \n Krysko and two co-authors, independent wildlife biologist Joe Wasilewski and UF wildlife ecology professor Frank Mazzotti, think more Nile crocs lurk unfound in the Everglades, but they aren't certain. \n \n Allyson Gantt, a spokeswoman for Everglades National Park, where one of the reptiles was found, disagrees, saying no Nile crocs still roam the park. \n \n Some Everglades visitors might not be aware of the differences between crocodiles and alligators, complicating efforts to confirm any remaining crocs. Crocodiles have angular snouts, and their lower teeth are exposed when their mouths are closed. \n \n Alligator snouts are rounded, with few exposed lower teeth. Nile crocs are usually bronze or brownish yellow; alligators are blackish green. \n \n All three Nile crocodiles were captured in extreme South Florida. \n \n The first, a hatchling, was found on a front porch and sent to a Louisiana reptile exhibit. The second, a female measuring 4 feet, was captured at a park. Wasilewski kept it, but later gave it to another licensed researcher. The third was captured twice. The first trapper didn't have the proper permit, so he released the female. The croc was recaptured two years later 18 miles away by water in Everglades National Park. It was euthanized.",

Analysis of one of the captured Nile crocodiles\u2014it grew 28% faster than Nile crocodiles in Africa\u2014showed they can thrive in Florida. And researchers believe there are likely more living in the Everglades. It's unclear how the Nile crocodiles got to Florida.

Eleven Secret Service employees are accused of misconduct in connection with a prostitution scandal at the hotel... (Associated Press) \n \n \"Every possible lead is being examined,\" said Rep. Peter King, who heads the House Homeland Security Committee. King, R-N.Y., said he expected that in the \"near future, several other\" members of the Secret Service will leave. \n \n \"What they were thinking is beyond me,\" King told NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \n \n So far, the scandal includes 12 Secret Service employees and 11 military members. \n \n Six of the Secret Service members have lost their jobs. One has been cleared and five remain on administrative leave. The main incident occurred shortly before Obama arrived for a meeting of regional presidents last weekend. \n \n A Secret Service official confirmed Sunday that one of the 12 implicated in the scandal was staying at a different hotel than the others. \n \n He was staying at the Hilton, where Obama eventually would stay, said the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The agent is being investigated for improprieties in a separate incident that may have happened on April 9, days before the president arrived and while the hotel was still open to the general public. \n \n Sen. Joe Lieberman, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, also mentioned the 12th agent under investigation in an appearance on CBS's \"Face the Nation.\" \n \n \"Now we don't know at this point what that 12th agent is being charged with and why he's been put on administrative leave. But now you're into the hotel where the president of the United States was going to stay. And it just gets more troubling,\" Lieberman said. \n \n Lieberman told Fox News Sunday there is \"no evidence that information was compromised\" in the incidents. Those involved \"were not acting like Secret Service agents. They were acting like a bunch of college students away on a spring student weekend,\" Lieberman said. \n \n King, Lieberman and other leaders of congressional committees examining the scandal made the rounds on Sunday news shows. Generally, they said the scandal was being closely scrutinized on Capitol Hill and voiced support for Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan's handling of the matter. \n \n Obama campaign adviser David Axelrod said the allegations are disturbing, but that the misdeeds of a few individuals should not tarnish the overall work and reputation of the service. \n \n Axelrod told CNN's \"State of the Union\" that he always felt the agents were willing to go to great lengths to protect the president and the people around him. He called the conduct in Colombia \"really disappointing.\" \n \n \"I think we will get to the bottom of it,\" said Axelrod, who worked at the White House before leaving last year to work full time in Obama's re-election campaign office in Chicago. \n \n He later told NBC that \"on the whole, the Secret Service does heroic work. This is quite disturbing. We have to get to the bottom of this, and I'm sure we will.\" \n \n Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., a frequent critic of the president, declined to fault the White House's response. \"You know, I'm not critical of what the administration has done thus far,\" he told CBS. \"I think what we're seeing is an aberration.\" \n \n Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the senior Republican on the Homeland Security Committee, and Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., both said that more female Secret Service agents might help guard against such incidents from happening again. \n \n \"I can't help but wonder if there had been more women as part of that detail, if this ever would have happened,\" Collins said on ABC's \"This Week.\" \n \n Maloney told the same program that only 11 percent of the Secret Service's agents are women. \n \n \"I can't help but keeping asking this question: Where are the women? We probably need to diversify the service and have more minorities and more women,\" Maloney said. \n \n Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, told NBC that the episode was \"something the Secret Service can fix. We have confidence that it will be fixed.\" \n \n \"The most important thing is that this never happens again,\" Issa said. \n \n Ralph Basham, a former Secret Service Director, told CBS the behavior of those implicated in the scandal \"could have compromised the trip and the safety of the president.\"",

(Associated Press) \n \n The crash site itself, in farmland held by the pro-Russian separatists who the West accuses of shooting down the plane, remained unsecured five days after the disaster \u2014 another source of frustration for officials around the world eager to establish the facts of the case. \n \n After an overnight journey, a refrigerated train carrying the bodies pulled into a station in Kharkiv, a government-controlled city where Ukrainian authorities have set up their crash investigation center. Government spokesman Oleksander Kharchenko said Ukraine \"will do our best\" to send the bodies to the Netherlands on Tuesday. Of the 298 people who died aboard the Amsterdam-to-Kuala Lumpur flight, 193 were Dutch citizens. \n \n In Brussels, European Union foreign ministers were discussing whether to impose more sanctions in response to the disaster. Europe and the United States have imposed targeted economic sanctions against Russia for supporting Ukraine's five-month insurgency that began after pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted by protesters in February. \n \n The rebels control a swathe of territory in two eastern provinces, and have battled Ukrainian troops with heavy weapons including tanks and missile launchers that the West says came from Russia. Russia denies supporting the insurgency. \n \n The sanctions so far have focused on individuals instead of entire sectors of the economy, though the EU was moving already to broaden them before the downing of the plane. British Prime Minister David Cameron said Monday that the jet's destruction on Thursday has drastically changed the situation, and that the Russians cannot expect continued access to European markets and capital if they continued to fuel a war against another European country. \n \n Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius blamed \"terrorists supplied by Moscow\" for shooting down the airliner, killing all aboard. He said he hoped the EU will impose beefed-up sanctions on Russia. His call for an arms embargo was a direct challenge to France, which is building two warships for the Russian navy. \n \n At the crash site near the village of Hrabove, a few rebel fighters accompanied observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The farmland where the wreckage is scattered was otherwise unguarded and unsecured. Even the red-and-white tape that had sealed off the fields had been torn away. \n \n In some places, the smell of decay and flies suggested the presence of remains under the wreckage, and observers said Monday that not all bodies had been recovered. \n \n About 70 villagers, most of them older women wearing headscarves, gathered across the road from the site to sing Ukrainian Orthodox hymns at a memorial service led by several black-robed priests. \n \n ___ \n \n Dahlburg contributed from Brussels.

Is it suggesting the Ukrainian SU-25 (despite its technical limitations) shot down the passenger jet in mid-air? \n \n And why? The plane would seem to have been travelling in the wrong direction for Ukrainian forces to have perceived it as a hostile aircraft coming from Russia, and the rebels don't have an air force. \n \n So are they seriously suggesting the Ukrainians deliberately moved their missiles on to rebel-held territory and shot the airliner down as part of some sort of nefarious plan to frame the rebels and turn world opinion against them? \n \n But then Russia doesn't need to prove its case - all it needs is to create one, to insist that there are different versions of events, that there is credible claim and counter-claim. \n \n In much the same manner as a criminal defence barrister, Russia doesn't have to demonstrate that its alleged client is innocent - just to establish enough doubt in the minds of the jury - in this case the international community - that they can't be completely sure. ||||| View Slideshow Ukrainian emergency workers carry a victim's body in a plastic bag at the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 near the village of Hrabove in eastern Ukraine on Monday.

Former National Transportation Safety Board chairman Jim Hall joins the News Hub with Sara Murray with details. Photo: Getty Images. \n \n The elaborate, televised Defense Ministry presentation\u2014at odds with Western and Ukrainian accusations that Kremlin-backed insurgents shot down the plane\u2014came as the U.S. and Russia clashed at the U.N. Security Council on Monday. There, both countries voted in favor of a unanimous resolution that condemned the downing of the jet and called for an independent international investigation into the incident. (Follow the latest updates on the Malaysia Airlines crash in Ukraine.) \n \n Russia sought to use both forums to push back against growing international criticism and U.S. and Ukrainian assertions that Moscow could have provided the missile system that brought down the plane. American officials charged that the Russian version of events was a propaganda effort aimed at slowing the international community's response to the geopolitical crisis\u2014or weakening proposed new sanctions to punish Moscow for its role in the conflict. \n \n At the news conference broadcast from Moscow, Russian air force chief Lt. Gen. Igor Makushev didn't say outright who the ministry thought had fired the missile that apparently brought down the airliner Thursday. Nor did he provide any photographic, radar or satellite evidencethat would show a missile track. \n \n But he said that Russian radar had spotted a second aircraft in the ill-fated airliner's vicinity just before the crash and that it was likely a Ukrainian fighter jet. A graphic that Gen. Makushev said was based on radar data depicted four commercial planes in the area shortly before the crash, as well as the alleged Ukrainian fighter jet. (View an interactive seating chart of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17.) \n \n His presentation also suggested an alternative theory, that satellite imagery showed Ukraine also had moved missile systems into the area before the incident. The air force chief presented several slides of satellite images he said showed the Ukrainian missile-system movements. \n \n The suggested version of events echoed much of what has been reported on Russian state television in recent days, which has suggested that Ukraine could have shot down the plane, possibly via one of its fighter planes. \n \n U.S. officials dismissed the Russian government's claim that a second plane was present when Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down last week as \"desperate\" propaganda. \n \n U.S. officials didn't provide their own evidence to back their arguments. But they pointed to Ukraine's statements Monday that the country's fighter jets were on the ground at the time of the crash. \n \n U.S. officials also said that Ukrainian fighters can't operate at 30,000 feet, where Flight 17 was cruising. \"The Russian government has a propaganda machine second to none, as these latest conspiracy theories demonstrate,\" one U.S. official said. \n \n The Obama administration reiterated its findings that Russia was the likely supplier of advanced SA-11 antiaircraft missiles to separatists, who fired it at the Malaysia Airlines jetliner. The White House said that an international case was building that indicated Russian complicity in the tragedy. \n \n \"What's clear is that there is a picture that's coming into focus,\" said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. \"And Russian claims to the contrary are getting both more desperate and much harder to believe.\" \n \n The war of words spilled over into the U.N. Security Council, where after the resolution vote, U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power and Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin gave sharply different versions of who was likely responsible for shooting down the Boeing 777 on Thursday, killing all 298 people on board. \n \n \"Russia has begun to blame Ukraine itself for the attack though the missile came from separatist territory that Russia knows full well Ukraine has not yet reclaimed,\" Ms. Power said. \n \n \"Russia must recognize that no move on the geopolitical chessboard with the West can offset the pain being felt by the passengers' families,\" she said. \n \n But Mr. Churkin chastised Ms. Power in the council chamber, saying, \"There can be no jumping to conclusions or political statements here.\" \n \n Mr. Churkin said Ukraine would have to answer to international investigators regarding the activities of its air-traffic controllers, why a Ukrainian antiaircraft missile battery in the area of the crash was \"hastily removed,\" and why Ukrainian radar was operating \"at an all-time high\" on the day of the incident. He also accused Ukraine of \"touching up\" intercepted phone calls of rebel commanders with audio from before the date of the crash. \n \n Kiev has dismissed Russian claims that it could have been involved, and Ukraine's security service has posted intercepted phone calls that it says are of pro-Russia rebel commanders discussing having shot down a plane they discovered afterward was a civilian aircraft. Moscow and the rebels have denied this. \n \n International forensic experts on Monday inspect the crash site of the Malaysia Airlines jet that was shot down in eastern Ukraine last week. Associated Press \n \n The U.S., which has largely backed Kiev's version of events, has said its intelligence analysts have evaluated a number of the audio recordings and said they were authentic. \n \n Earlier on Monday, Gen. Makushev said that the two Russian radar stations near Russia's border with Ukraine observed the presence of the second aircraft over a period of four minutes on the day of Flight 17's crash. These stations couldn't identify the aircraft because it mostly likely wasn't equipped with the system of secondary identification of aircrafts, \"which is characteristic of fighter jets,\" he said. \n \n Gen. Makushev said that Russian radars could only spot the aircraft at the point of its ascension because the on-duty radars only detected objects at above 5,000 meters. Russian radars spotted the unidentified plane patrolling in the vicinity of Flight 17, \"controlling the development of the situation,\" he said. \n \n The defense ministry also said it registered the Su-25 fighter jet ascending within close range of several civil aircrafts, including the Malaysia Airlines jet. \n \n Another top military official, Lt. Gen. Andrei Kartapolov, said at the same news conference that the jet came as close as 1.8 miles to Flight 17, which is well within the range of the air-to-air missiles it is usually equipped with. \n \n Interactives \n \n Gen. Makushev also showed satellite photos allegedly showing several Buk-M1 ground-to-air missile systems in the area close to where the plane crashed. The systems, he argued, could only belong to the Ukrainian military. The Buks were spotted in Luhansk and Donetsk by Russians, Gen. Kartapolov said, in the days leading up to the crash. \n \n Ukrainian officials have said its own Buk systems were well out of range, and have accused Russia of giving the rebels a Buk system, which then shot down the airliner. Russia denies this. \n \n Public tracking website Flightradar24 followed Flight 17 from its departure from Amsterdam through to its final moments over Ukraine. The aircraft was observed to be roughly 10 miles north of the L980 jetway that was a part of its filed flight plan. Such a deviation isn't unusual, though, and can be affected by weather. \n \n Similarly, Gen. Makushev said the Malaysia Airlines plane deviated from its course by close to 9 miles near Donetsk but then attempted to return to its course, crashing shortly after. Russian radars spotted the Flight 17 rapidly descending 32 miles away from the Russian border, Russian officials said. \n \n He said Russia is prepared to hand all of the information it has to the European authorities, which included satellite imagery and data from its own radar. \n \n Russian defense ministry officials also claimed that a U.S. satellite was spotted at the time of the Flight 17 crash and asked that the U.S. release the satellite images from that time. The U.S. didn't immediately comment on the claim. \n \n \u2014Joe Lauria \n \n and Julian E.

Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), has said it will provide a point-by-point rebuttal to the Republican version. Trump could attempt to block it from being made public; the White House said Monday it would \u201centertain\u201d the request to release it. \n \n Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee said they endorsed the release of the Democratic memo in a nod to transparency, but one lawmaker, Rep. Tom Rooney (R-Fla.) said the Schiff memo will only further \"muddy the water\" surrounding the Russia investigation. He called the claims in the Democratic memo inaccurate \"for a million different reasons.\" \n \n \"But I am all for letting the people see it and decide for themselves,\" he added. \n \n Rooney said he hoped Trump would support the release of the memo as he did for Republicans' and that he didn't see much that would need to be redacted. \n \n Schiff told reporters that Democrats had already provided copies of their memo to the FBI and Justice Department for review, a step he noted Republicans refused to take. He said he wants to ensure that any redactions to the memo are made by professional at those agencise rather than by the White House \"for political purposes.\" \n \n Schiff also complained that Nunes declined, once again, to reveal whether the White House had any role in developing the GOP memo. He said Nunes denied the administration had a role in \"drafting\" the document but repeatedly declined to answer questions about other possible influence by the White House. \n \n Nunes spokesman Jack Langer rejected the idea that the White House had any influence over the memo. \n \n \u201cThe idea that the White House had any input whatsoever in the conception or writing of the memo is a totally false claim perpetuated by the Democrats and, as usual, dutifully reported by Politico,\u201d he said in a statement. \n \n In a transcript of a committee meeting last week, Nunes was asked by Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.) whether the White House had any role in the GOP memo and he said \"as far as I know, no.\" He declined to answer further questions when pressed by Quigley. \n \n",

A tweet Trump sent earlier on Monday about the lead Democrat on the panel, Adam Schiff, raises doubts about the prospect, notes the Washington Post. Trump accused Schiff of leaving committee hearings to \"illegally leak confidential information\" and said he \"must be stopped.\" Schiff has previously asserted that the Republican memo is misleading and intended mainly to discredit the Robert Mueller investigation. He and his staffers compiled the 10-page rebuttal memo in question, and Schiff has said it presents a point-by-point refutation of the Republican version, reports Politico.

    "document": "Raul Ramirez to be sentenced to three years in prison for case with similarities to Stanford sexual assault case for which Brock Turner will serve only six months \n \n The embattled judge in the Stanford sexual assault trial is presiding over a similar case in which a Latino man is facing a much harsher sentence than Brock Turner, raising questions about how the former student may have benefited from his privileged background. \n \n Raul Ramirez, a 32-year-old immigrant from El Salvador who admitted to sexually assaulting his female roommate in a case that has similarities with the Stanford case, will be sentenced to three years in state prison under a deal overseen by judge Aaron Persky, according to records obtained by the Guardian. \n \n The three-year-prison sentence, part of a plea agreement signed in March, provides a sharp contrast to the outcome for Turner, a white 20-year-old former Stanford swimmer who Persky sentenced to probation and six months in county jail after he was convicted of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman. \n \n \n \n Ex-Stanford swimmer gets six months in jail and probation for sexual assault Read more \n \n The parallel cases, which include similar felony charges of sexual assault, could lend weight to what critics of Persky allege are biases in his courtroom. Others, however, argue that Persky\u2019s actions were reasonable and that the divergence in punishments stems from broader disparities in the criminal justice system. \n \n \u201cWhat\u2019s happened with Mr Ramirez is standard,\u201d said Alexander Cross, a defense attorney who briefly represented Ramirez when his family could afford a private lawyer. \u201cThe anomaly is the Stanford case.\u201d \n \n \u2018He wanted to say sorry\u2019 \n \n The details of the Stanford sexual assault conviction have become well known since the case received global attention. On 18 January 2015, two passersby on campus spotted Turner \u201cthrusting\u201d on top of a motionless woman lying on the ground outside of a fraternity house by a dumpster. \n \n Turner, from Dayton, Ohio, admitted to fingering her, but claimed it was consensual. A jury disagreed and convicted him of assault with intent to commit rape of an intoxicated woman, sexually penetrating an intoxicated person with a foreign object and sexually penetrating an unconscious person with a foreign object. \n \n Instead of sentencing him to the minimum of two years in state prison prescribed by law, Persky made an exception for Turner, determining that his case was \u201cunusual\u201d and that prison would have a \u201csevere impact\u201d on him. After the victim\u2019s impact statement went viral, the judge\u2019s controversial sentencing decision, which will result in Turner spending three months in jail, received international scorn. \n \n Critics slammed the judge for being sympathetic to Turner and concluding that there was \u201cless moral culpability\u201d because he was intoxicated at the time. Persky is now facing a recall campaign led by a Stanford law professor, and lawmakers have called for an investigation. \n \n Court documents show that although the allegations in Ramirez\u2019s case mirror the Stanford assault in several ways, the defendant had a very different experience at multiple stages of the court process. \n \n Ramirez was arrested at his home in Santa Clara County in November 2014 after his roommate called 911 to say that he had sexually assaulted her, according to police reports. \n \n Stanford sexual assault case: victim impact statement in full Read more \n \n Ramirez gave the woman a \u201clove letter\u201d and later entered her bedroom and fingered her for about five to 10 minutes against her will, according to a police report, and stopped only when she started crying. \n \n When police arrived, he admitted to the assault. \u201cRamirez knew what he did was wrong and he wanted to say sorry,\u201d one officer wrote. \n \n Ramirez, who has used a Spanish interpreter in court, had his bail set at $200,000 \u2013 significantly higher than the $150,000 bail set for Turner. \n \n Ramirez could not be reached for comment, and multiple attorneys who have represented him declined to connect him to the Guardian. \n \n \u2018A question of lifestyle\u2019 \n \n Judge Persky handled the hearings and negotiations in the Ramirez case, according to Santa Clara county prosecutors. Terry Lynn Harman, assistant district attorney, said that the judge agreed with the prosecutors\u2019 position throughout the process \u2013 that Ramirez should receive a state prison sentence. \n \n According to records of the plea deal that Persky oversaw, Ramirez agreed to plead guilty to a felony of sexual penetration by force. Under the terms of the deal, he will spend three years in state prison, the minimum punishment for the offense. \n \n Persky is expected to formalize the three-year sentence at a later date, Harman said. \n \n The prosecution had no objections to Persky\u2019s handling of the case, she added. In the Turner case, the Santa Clara district attorney slammed Persky\u2019s sentencing decision. \n \n Ramirez, like Turner, has no criminal record of convictions for serious or violent felonies, according to court records. \n \n Because Ramirez ultimately pleaded guilty to a felony offense that does not have an option for probation or a lighter sentence, Persky was limited in the sentence he could approve for the specific conviction. \n \n But critics say that Persky, a former Stanford athlete himself, bent over backwards to make an exception in the Turner case, and that if he wanted to give Ramirez the same favorable treatment, the judge could have utilized his discretion and recommended a less harsh prosecution. \n \n Specifically, Persky could have approved or helped negotiate a bargain in which Ramirez only pleaded guilty to the lesser of two charges he was facing \u2013 assault with intent to commit rape. If the more serious charge was dropped \u2013 as was the case with Turner, who had two rape charges dropped \u2013 Ramirez could have potentially avoided prison. \n \n Michele Landis Dauber, the Stanford professor leading the recall, said the Ramirez case was further evidence that the judge should be removed. \u201cThis just shows that our concern about Judge Persky\u2019s ability to be unbiased is justified. We continue to think that he abused his discretion in giving an unduly lenient sentence to Turner,\u201d he said. \n \n Ramirez\u2019s three-year deal \u201cshows that Turner got consideration not available to other defendants who aren\u2019t as privileged\u201d, added Dauber, who is also a family friend of the Stanford victim. \n \n Persky is barred from commenting on pending cases. \n \n While the Ramirez case and the Stanford assault have clear differences in race and class \u2013 Cross said Ramirez is \u201cvery poor\u201d \u2013 the two stories also diverge in the defendants\u2019 responses. \n \n Turner has continued to blame his assault on a \u201cparty culture\u201d of \u201cdrinking\u201d, claiming that the woman consented, even though police and others confirmed that she was unconscious. Ramirez pleaded guilty and, according to police accounts, apologized. \n \n In court, Persky said Turner should not be faulted for refusing to admit to the assault: \u201cI\u2019m not convinced that his lack of complete acquiescence to the verdict should count against him.\u201d \n \n Cross said that when privileged defendants can pay a private attorney and articulate the ways in which a prison sentence would have a severe impact \u2013 destroying a promising athletic career, for example \u2013 they fare better than average working class people. \u201cIt\u2019s really a question of lifestyle.\u201d \n \n Persky had dozens of letters from Turner\u2019s friends and family attesting to his character and outlining what it would mean to be separated from him if he went to prison. \n \n Cross said that in a case like Ramirez\u2019s, \u201csociety is not exactly suffering a loss. At least, that\u2019s not how it\u2019s looked upon\u201d. \n \n Experts also note that it\u2019s not surprising a low-income defendant of color would face a worse outcome than a white man in comparable cases. \n \n \u201cWhether due to implicit bias or other factors, race still plays a role in sentencing outcomes,\u201d said Marc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project, a criminal justice reform group. \n \n Research has repeatedly shown that black and Latino people sentenced in state and federal courts are much more likely to face incarceration than white offenders in similar circumstances \u2013 and they receive longer sentences. \n \n Persky\u2019s defenders \n \n In the wake of the intense backlash against Persky, public defenders and other criminal justice reform advocates have come to his defense, arguing that judges must have discretion to issue lenient sentences when appropriate. \n \n An Associated Press review of 20 criminal cases for which Persky has issued sentences also concluded that there didn\u2019t appear to be any racial biases in his decisions. \n \n Gary Goodman, a supervising attorney for the Santa Clara County public defender\u2019s office, who has spoken up in favor of Persky, was one of several lawyers who represented Ramirez. \n \n He pointed out that the distinct outcomes in the two cases stems from the way that California law treats sexual assault of a conscious person as a more serious offense than attacking an unconscious victim. \n \n Goodman also said that Persky played a passive role in Ramirez\u2019s plea negotiations. \n \n Cross, too, said that although he believes that the system favors wealthier, privileged defendants, he did not fault Persky. \n \n \u201cI\u2019ve found him to be one of the fairest judges.\u201d ||||| First, we are proud of your leading role in advocating for reform of how society responds to sexual violence. Rape and other forms of sexual assault are urgent problems that are too often neglected or obscured by euphemisms, silence, and shame. The best scholars use their expertise to shine light on pressing civic issues like these: they articulate their visions of a more just society, and they engage with policymakers and the public to spur and shape reform. We\u2019ve been privileged to learn at a place where faculty like you take up that mantle. \n \n We\u2019d also like to emphasize our agreement with your goals. We, like you, believe that members of the Stanford community \u2014 indeed, of every community \u2014 should be doing all we can to confront the problem head on, by preventing sexual violence in the first place, ensuring that those who experience it receive support and healing, and insisting that those responsible face consequences that reflect the seriousness of their actions. We, like you, are disturbed by the six-month jail sentence that Turner received, which appears lenient when measured against the relevant sentencing guidelines, the much-longer sentences many thousands of Americans are serving for less-serious crimes, and the trauma that the target of his assault so bravely described at Turner\u2019s sentencing hearing. And we, like you, are especially troubled by our suspicion that race and privilege explain those discrepancies. Accountability means little when we demand it only from the already-disenfranchised, and the transformative power of mercy is diminished when we reserve it only for the privileged. \n \n At the same time, one aspect of your recent advocacy troubles us: the nascent campaign you have championed to recall Judge Aaron Persky, who sentenced Turner. We have deep reservations about the idea of a judge \u2014 any judge \u2014 being fired over sentencing decisions that the public perceives as too lenient. \n \n As we\u2019ve learned during our time at the law school, judicial independence is a cornerstone of due process and an essential prerequisite of a fair criminal justice system. Judges are entrusted with immense power over the life and liberty of criminal defendants from all walks of life, and they need latitude to exercise that power judiciously. After decades of mass incarceration driven by mandatory minimums and other punitive sentencing regimes, we believe that judicial leniency is already too scarce, even though we strongly disagree with how it was applied to Turner. And in a world where judges believe they are one unpopular sentencing decision away from an abrupt pink slip, it will only grow scarcer. A high-profile campaign to recall Judge Persky because he showed too much solicitude for a defendant convicted of odious crimes would evoke an ugly chapter of California\u2019s history: when three justices of our state\u2019s highest court were recalled from the bench because they voted to oppose the death penalty, in accordance with the dictates of justice and the constitution as they understood them. Though the values underlying that effort were different from the ones animating the current recall debate, the chilling effect on judicial independence would be the same. \n \n To be clear, our hesitation about a recall campaign does not stem from a belief that Judge Persky\u2019s decision to give Turner a below-guidelines sentence was correct or that his stated justifications for doing so were sound. Many of us, like you, believe that justice called for a stiffer sentence in his case. But we think humility requires us to recognize that we won\u2019t always be able to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate exercises of judicial mercy. If you or we claim the power to make that decision, how can we credibly deny it to anyone else? If we demand that Judge Persky immediately hand over his gavel for acting on his empathy for this defendant, how we can we credibly assure any other judge that her hand need not waver when the human circumstances of a case seem to call for compassion? \n \n This is not an abstract concern: many of us count our work with Stanford\u2019s Three Strikes Project as one of the most powerful experiences we had at SLS. Through the project, we represented clients serving life sentences for non-violent felonies as they petitioned for early release under Propositions 36 and 47 \u2014 transformative ballot measures championed by your Stanford colleagues, which have begun to roll back the worst excesses of California\u2019s punitive sentencing laws. In that role, we had to ask county judges like Aaron Persky to grant early release to men and women serving life in prison because the people of California once believed that our clients\u2019 mistakes made them irredeemable. Even when an inmate has made great strides in prison, and even though statistics show that people resentenced under Propositions 36 and 47 pose little danger of recidivism, granting that second chance is a delicate decision that requires courage on the part of judges: they have to bear the risk, however remote, that the petitioner will abuse that mercy in ways that provoke public backlash against their decision. \n \n We believe it would send a powerful message to these judges and others making similar decisions around the country if, while continuing to critique Judge Persky\u2019s sentencing decisions and calling for a different approach in future cases, you abstained from your effort to recall him from the bench and instead focused on other avenues of response and reform. These might include educating future judges and jurors about the realities of sexual assault, or pressing for systemic changes in how these cases are handled. We simply ask that you withhold your support for a recall campaign that would set a dangerous precedent against the exercise of merciful discretion in our criminal justice system. \n \n Sincerely, \n \n Akiva Freidlin, Emi Young, Ginny Halden, Jeannie Lieder, Madeleine McKenna, Michael Skocpol, Nick Rosellini, and Vina Seelam (Drafters) ||||| In the midst of ongoing controversy over former Stanford student Brock Turner\u2019s six-month jail sentence for sexual assault, a group of 53 recent graduates of Stanford Law School (SLS) have come forward with an open letter to SLS\u2019s Frederick I. Richman Professor of Law Michele Dauber that criticizes Turner\u2019s lenient sentencing but at the same time urges Dauber to reconsider her efforts to recall Judge Aaron Persky \u201984 A.M. \u201985. \n \n The recall movement that has thrust Persky into the national spotlight includes several online petitions that called for his removal from the bench after many criticized his sentence for Turner as too light. Dauber has blasted the sentence in several media outlets. In her article for the Washington Post, she responds to Roderick O\u2019Connor, a deputy public defender who has opposed the recall movement. \n \n \u201cBrock Turner\u2019s sentence for three violent sexual felonies isn\u2019t merely shocking, it\u2019s dangerous,\ufffd? she writes. \u201cIt reinforces the myth that sexual assault is not a serious crime, particularly when it is perpetrated by young white male athletes in elite universities.\ufffd? \n \n Dauber has been an active organizer for the recall efforts, spearheading the official California recall movement. And she has long been a prominent figure in the legal community for campus sexual assault. From 2011 to 2013, Dauber co-chaired Stanford\u2019s Board on Judicial Affairs and helped to lead the first University process that reformed Stanford\u2019s policy on sexual assault. \n \n The law graduates\u2019 open letter neither supports nor defends Persky\u2019s decision, but rather focuses on issues of judicial independence and warns of a recall\u2019s potential impact on future jurisdiction, according to several drafters. Although the dictionary term of judicial independence applies to federal judges (Persky is a state court judge), the letter-writers and signers are concerned with the consequences of a public majority recalling any judge. \n \n \u201cJudicial independence is a cornerstone of due process and an essential prerequisite of a fair criminal justice system,\ufffd? the letter states. \n \n The SLS graduates emphasize that they are just as troubled as Dauber by the case\u2019s handling of the issues of race, privilege and sexual assault\u2013 and that they do not believe that Persky\u2019s decision was correct. However, they argue that judges must be allowed discretion: \n \n \u2026humility requires us to recognize that we won\u2019t always be able to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate exercises of judicial mercy. If you or we claim the power to make that decision, how can we credibly deny it to anyone else? If we demand that Judge Persky immediately hand over his gavel for acting on his empathy for this defendant, how we can we credibly assure any other judge that her hand need not waver when the human circumstances of a case seem to call for compassion? \n \n Nicholas Rosellini \u201912 J.D. \u201916, who helped draft the letter, discussed the recall as a dangerous precedent to set. He said that to ensure due process, judges must be able to examine facts without fear of an angry public. \n \n Rosellini, who participated in SLS\u2019s Three Strikes Project, worries that erosions in judicial independence could affect the future of disenfranchised people. He said that judges are the last stop for \u201cunpopular people\ufffd? such as the incarcerated, the convicted, the accused, and minorities. \n \n \u201cOnce you do that [recall process], it\u2019s really hard to credibly deny that to the next group of people who are angry for another reason that might be unjustified,\ufffd? Rosellini said. \n \n Another drafter of the letter, Akiva Freidlin J.D. \u201916, explained the motivation and planning of the letter.

There are some 788,063 voters registered in the county. \n \n An official recall campaign launched by Stanford University Law professor Michele Dauber and backed by the Progressive Women Silicon Valley State PAC is currently raising funds and plans next spring to gather the signatures needed to mount a special election in Santa Clara County to put Persky's recall to voters. Brown noted in a Capitol Weekly column on the poll that such a \"recall is not going to be won or lost based on the number of likes and retweets, speeches given, or how many times the victim's letter is re-read. \n \n \"It comes down to the narrow universe of actual voters in Santa Clara County participating in a future, likely low intensity, local election.\" \n \n The poll found that Turner's sentence -- six months in county jail and three years of probation -- was \"widely understood by voters and violated their sense of justice,\" Brown wrote in the Capitol Weekly column. (Editor's note: The poll actually misstated the sentence, telling voters that the length of probation was three months, not three years. Brown wrote in an email to the Weekly that while he regrets the \"inadvertent human\" error, he feels \"quite comfortable that the length of the jail sentence is the driving factor in these results.\") \n \n Sixty-three percent of voters believe that the Turner sentence demonstrates that Persky cannot be fair in any case, rather than a \"one-time lapse\" on a high-profile case, Brown wrote. \n \n Women, and especially younger women, expressed more than 4-to-1 support of the recall, Brown wrote. \n \n Sixty-seven percent of respondents said the following aligns most closely with their opinion of the sentence: \"This sentence is a sign that Judge Persky might have problems with ethics or an ability to be a fair judge in all cases.\" \n \n Thirty-three percent, however, thought that the sentence represents a \"single error of judgment ... a flaw in one stand-alone case.\" \n \n The implications of race and privilege in this case have been raised by many. More than three-quarters (77 percent) of respondents in the poll agreed that if Turner had been African American or Latino, he would have received a tougher sentence. \n \n After reading a pro-recall statement provided in the survey that calls Persky's sentencing decision an \"insult to victims of sexual assault and women,\" respondents supported the recall in slightly greater numbers -- by an increase of 2 percent. \n \n Support dropped to 59 percent, however, after respondents read an anti-recall message that argues \"removing a judge of a single, high-profile case sets a very dangerous precedent that will cause judges to pay more attention to public opinion than following the law and their best judgment.\" \n \n Voters 55 years and older \u0097 whom Brown wrote \"tend to dominate low-turnout off-year elections, which is what this recall would be\" \u0097 were split on their final recall vote: 51 percent of male respondents 55 years and older said they would support it as well as 55 percent of women in that age group. \n \n Respondents were split evenly by gender (49 percent male and 51 percent female) and were primarily Caucasian. The age groups with the most participation were 18 to 24 years old (24 percent) and over 65 years old (23 percent). \n \n The poll results are available here. \n \n --- \n \n The Palo Alto Weekly has created Storify pages to capture ongoing coverage of the Brock Turner case as well as sexual-assault issues at Stanford University.

According to court records, Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky oversaw a plea deal earlier this year involving Raul Ramirez, a 32-year-old man from El Salvador who sexually assaulted his female roommate. Ramirez, who needed an interpreter in court, agreed to plead guilty in a deal that will see him spend three years in state prison, while Turner will spend just six months in county jail. Critics say that if Persky had treated Ramirez as leniently as he treated Turner, a white 20-year-old, the Latino man would have ended up with a much lighter sentence or even have avoided prison. The deal \"shows that Turner got consideration not available to other defendants who aren\u2019t as privileged,\" says Michele Landis Dauber, a Stanford professor leading a campaign to recall Persky, who's a former Stanford student.

    "document": "Claiming Shakespeare authorship can be a perilous endeavor. In 1996, Donald Foster, a pioneer in computer-driven textual analysis, drew front-page headlines with his assertion that Shakespeare was the author of an obscure Elizabethan poem called \u201cA Funeral Elegy,\u201d only to quietly retract his argument six years later after analyses by Mr. Vickers and others linked it to a different author. \n \n This time, editors of some prestigious scholarly editions are betting that Mr. Bruster\u2019s cautiously methodical arguments, piled on top of previous work by Mr. Vickers and others, will make the attribution stick. \n \n \u201cWe don\u2019t have any absolute proof, but this is as close as you can get,\u201d said Eric Rasmussen, a professor at the University of Nevada, Reno, and an editor, with Jonathan Bate, of the Royal Shakespeare Company\u2019s edition of the complete Shakespeare. \n \n \u201cI think we can now say with some authority that, yes, this is Shakespeare,\u201d Mr. Rasmussen said. \u201cIt has his fingerprints all over it.\u201d \n \n Photo \n \n Mr. Rasmussen and Mr. Bate are including \u201cThe Spanish Tragedy\u201d in the Royal Shakespeare Company\u2019s new edition of Shakespeare\u2019s collaboratively authored plays, to be published in November. And Mr. Bruster plans to include the Additional Passages in his new edition of the Riverside Shakespeare (renamed the Bankside Shakespeare), coming in 2016. \n \n If embraced by the broader world of Shakespeareans, the Additional Passages would become the first largely undisputed new addition to the canon since Shakespeare\u2019s contributions to \u201cEdward III\u201d \u2014 another play that some have attributed to Kyd \u2014 began appearing in scholarly editions in the mid-1990s. \n \n Acceptance is by no means assured. Three years ago, some scholars were skeptical when the Arden Shakespeare published \u201cDouble Falsehood,\u201d an 18th-century play whose connection with a lost Shakespeare drama had long been debated, in its prestigious series. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Tiffany Stern, a professor of early modern drama at Oxford University and an advisory editor for the Arden Shakespeare, praised the empirical rigor of Mr. Bruster\u2019s paper, but said that some new attributions were driven less by solid evidence than by publishers\u2019 desire to offer \u201cmore Shakespeare\u201d than their rivals. \n \n \u201cThe arguments for \u2018The Spanish Tragedy\u2019 are better than for most\u201d putative Shakespeare collaborations, Ms. Stern said. \u201cBut I think we\u2019re going a bit Shakespeare-attribution crazy and shoving a lot of stuff in that maybe shouldn\u2019t be there.\u201d \n \n Elizabethan theater was intensely collaborative, with playwrights often punching up old plays or working with other dramatists to cobble together new ones, in the manner of Hollywood script doctors. The 1602 Additional Passages to \u201cThe Spanish Tragedy,\u201d inserted more than a decade after Kyd wrote the original, updated the bloody revenge play with a bit of psychological realism, which had become fashionable. (It is not known whether Kyd, who died in 1594, ever met Shakespeare.) \n \n The idea that Shakespeare may have written the Additional Passages \u2014 which include a \u201cHamlet\u201d-like scene of a grief-maddened father discoursing on the death of his son \u2014 was first broached in 1833 by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. But that claim remained a distinctly minority position well into the 20th century, even as scholars began using sophisticated computer software to detect subtle linguistic patterns that seemed to link the passages to Shakespeare\u2019s other work. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

(In the 1604 quarto version of \u201cHamlet,\u201d for example, Hamlet\u2019s mother, Gertrude, is called \u201cGertrad\u201d \u2014 probably a reflection, Mr. Rasmussen said, of Shakespeare\u2019s tendency to close up his u\u2019s and drop his final e\u2019s.) \n \n In his paper, Mr. Bruster identifies 24 broad spelling patterns \u2014 including shortened past tenses (like \u201cblest\u201d for \u201cblessed\u201d) and single medial consonants (like \u201csorow\u201d instead of \u201csorrow\u201d) \u2014 that occur both in the Additional Passages, for which no known manuscript survives, and the Shakespeare handwriting sample in the British Library. He also cites nine textual \u201ccorruptions\u201d (like \u201ccreuie\u201d instead of \u201ccreuic,\u201d modernized as \u201ccrevice\u201d) that he believes can be explained as misreadings of Shakespeare\u2019s handwriting. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n These irregularities, considered individually, are not necessarily unique to Shakespeare. But taken together, Mr. Bruster argues, they strongly suggest that the Additional Passages were set in type from pages written, in the most literal sense, by Shakespeare. \n \n \u201cWhat I\u2019m getting at is the DNA of Shakespeare\u2019s words themselves, the way he formed those words with his pen on the page,\u201d he said. \n \n A printer\u2019s misreading, Mr. Bruster argues, may also explain a particularly clumsy and nongrammatical stretch in the Additional Passages. During a moving speech, the grieving father, Hieronimo, meditates on the nature of a father\u2019s love for his son. \n \n The 1602 quarto renders it: \u201cWhat is there yet in a sonne? He must be fed,/Be thaught to goe, and speake I, or yet./Why might not a man loue a Calfe as well?\u201d \n \n But that baffling \u201cI, or yet,\u201d Mr. Bruster argues, is likely a misreading of \u201cIer\u201d \u2014 an abbreviation indicating the line is spoken by Hieronimo, a name that in Shakespeare\u2019s time was sometimes rendered as Ieronimo. \n \n The passage, Mr. Bruster argues, should really read (with modernized spelling): \u201cWhat is there yet in a son?/He must be fed, be taught to go, and speak./Yet why might not a man love a calf as well?\u201d \n \n Mr. Bruster once counted himself among the many scholars who have thought the passage in the quarto was simply too poorly written to be Shakespeare. \u201cBut once you realize that it\u2019s Shakespeare\u2019s handwriting that\u2019s responsible for the misreading, it\u2019s no longer a bad line,\u201d Mr. Bruster said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a gorgeous passage.\u201d \n \n Finding some of Shakespeare\u2019s lines embedded in another writer\u2019s plays may not carry the frisson of announcing the discovery of a previously unknown poem entirely by Shakespeare. But Mr. Bruster\u2019s paper reflects current scholarly interest in Shakespeare as a playwright who frequently collaborated with others \u2014 including, Mr. Vickers has controversially argued, on plays we think of as coming solely from his own pen. \n \n \u201cShakespeare wasn\u2019t a solitary genius, flying above everyone else,\u201d Mr. Vickers said. \u201cHe was a working man of the theater. If his company needed a new play, he\u2019d get together with someone else and get it done.\u201d ||||| Aug. 13, 2013 \n \n AUSTIN, Texas \u2014 For centuries, scholars have been searching for answers to a literary mystery: Who wrote the five additional passages in Thomas Kyd\u2019s \u201cThe Spanish Tragedy\u201d? \n \n Mounting arguments point to William Shakespeare, but English professor Douglas Bruster has recently found evidence confirming that the 325 additional lines are indeed the work of the Bard. \n \n According to Bruster\u2019s textual analysis, published in the July online issue of Notes and Queries, the proof lies in Shakespeare\u2019s trademark misspellings and the bad handwriting behind them. \n \n \u201cThis is the clinching evidence we need to admit the additional passages into the Shakespeare canon,\u201d says Bruster. \u201cIt\u2019s not every day we get to identify new writing by Shakespeare, so this is an exciting moment.\u201d \n \n Bruster examined Shakespeare\u2019s spelling habits in the manuscript pages of the 16th-century play \u201cSir Thomas More.\u201d Using Shakespeare\u2019s contributions as a guide, he identified 24 points of similarity between \u201cSir Thomas More\u201d and \u201cThe Spanish Tragedy,\u201d a play republished, with new material, at about the time of \u201cHamlet.\u201d \n \n The findings reveal that Shakespeare\u2019s spelling was both old-fashioned and idiosyncratic. For example, with words like \u201cspotless\u201d and \u201cdarkness\u201d Shakespeare would use a single \u201cs.\u201d Past-tense words like \u201cwrapped\u201d and \u201cblessed\u201d he ended with a \u201ct\u201d (i.e., \u201cwrapt,\u201d \u201cblest\u201d). Also telling is his habit of spelling the same word in two different ways (i.e., \u201calley\u201d spelled \u201callie\u201d and \u201callye\u201d in the same line). \n \n Shakespeare\u2019s contributions to the revised version of Kyd\u2019s play were first suspected in 1833 by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the noted poet, philosopher and literary critic. Yet the cold case has remained unsolved owing to a number of awkward lines in the additions. Like a game of telephone, Shakespeare\u2019s words got lost in translation, resulting in phrases that barely resemble the original, Bruster says. \n \n \u201cOne line in particular literally kept me up at night wondering what Shakespeare was doing,\u201d Bruster says. \u201cThen I realized that the copyist or printer had misread his handwriting. It turns out that the worst line in the additional passages wasn\u2019t what Shakespeare wrote. Once you recognize what the line originally said, the beauty of his verse rises to the surface.\u201d \n \n Watch Professor Douglas Bruster explain how he knew that a short section of a Thomas Kyd play, \u201cThe Spanish Tragedy,\u201d was actually written by William Shakespeare. The scholar also reads the \u201cnew\u201d work. \n \n For more information, contact: Jessica Sinn, College of Liberal Arts, 512-471-2404; Douglas Bruster, Department of English, 512-471-3635, bruster@mail.utexas.edu",

None other than Samuel Taylor Coleridge raised the question in 1833, and a 2012 computer analysis seemed to lend credence to the theory. Now, a University of Texas professor says the proof may be in the handwriting\u2014and bad handwriting at that. In a paper to be published next month, Douglas Bruster compares the play's 1602 \"Additional Passages\" with a three-page handwriting sample believed to be the Bard's held at the British Library. What he found, per the New York Times and UT at Austin News: about two dozen similar spelling patterns (for instance, \"sorow for \"sorrow\"; past-tense words that ended in \"t\", like \"wrapt\"; and one word spelled two ways, like \"allie\" and \"allye\" for \"alley\") and nine textual \"corruptions\" that he believes resulted from the printer misreading Shakespeare's hand. He also thinks an awkward passage\u2014so seemingly poorly written that it has been cited as evidence the lines couldn't have been crafted by Shakespeare\u2014is the result of another bad handwriting/printer error goof. Says Bruster, \"This is the clinching evidence we need to admit the additional passages into the Shakespeare canon.\" The Times notes this would mark the first such addition since passages from Edward III (also attributed to Kyd) were included in scholarly editions in the mid-'90s.

The Russian also stands accused of approving the attempted murder with nerve agent of a former Russian spy in Great Britain earlier this year, and backs Syrian leader Bashar Assad, whose forces Trump has twice struck as punishment for their use of chemical weapons. \n \n Russia experts say that Putin would see a meeting with Trump as a chance to shed western sanctions imposed over his aggression in Ukraine and U.S. election interference. \n \n \"This is really what Putin sees as the benefit of the 2016 presidential election.

He is an equal,\" said Heather Conley, senior vice president for Europe, Eurasia, and the Arctic at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \n \n \"Russia and the United States will be seen as equals at the summit and that is exactly what President Putin desires.\u201d \n \n Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

Earlier this month, Trump called for Russia\u2019s readmission to the G7 group of major economic powers, which expelled Russia after its 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. \n \n Senior administration officials have been quietly preparing for the potential meeting for weeks at the urging of the president, who is eager to have a formal sit-down with his Russian counterpart, according to a second person familiar with the planning. Trump has told aides he\u2019s unconcerned with the optics of the meeting, the person added, despite Washington\u2019s fixation with the federal investigations into alleged collusion between his presidential campaign and the Kremlin. \n \n The timing could be particularly awkward given its proximity to the annual NATO gathering, where maintaining a stiff resolve against Russian aggression will undoubtedly be a key theme. As part of the trip, Trump is also scheduled to pay a July 13 state visit to Britain, where officials remain furious over the attempted murder of the former Russian intelligence agent Sergey Skripal in March. Skripal, once imprisoned by Russia as a British spy, fell into a coma along with his daughter after they came into contact with nerve agent in March at his home in Salisbury, England. U.S. and British officials have concluded that Russia was behind the operation. \n \n Trump has long believed that the U.S. and Russia must establish a more cooperative relationship, however. Trump allies say the president believes the two countries can cooperate on issues like fighting terrorism in the Middle East, although many experts doubt that Moscow can be trusted as a strategic U.S. partner. \n \n \u201cOn June 25-27, U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton will meet with U.S. allies in London and Rome to discuss national security issues, andtravel to Moscow to discuss a potential meeting between Presidents Trump and Putin,\u201d National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis said in a tweet following reports in Russian media that Bolton would make the trip to Moscow. \n \n Bolton will be accompanied to Moscow by several White House staffers, including the national security council's director for Russia, Fiona Hill, and the NSC's director for southern Europe, Julia Friedlander. \n \n Speculation about the location of a possible Trump-Putin summit has focused on Vienna, although some Russia-watchers have noted that the final match of the 2018 World Cup soccer tournament will be held on July 15 at Moscow\u2019s Luzhniki Stadium \u2014 just two days after Trump is scheduled to stop in Britain. \n \n Trump has pursued a meeting with Putin at least since an April phone call in which the president invited Putin to visit the White House; there are no signs that Trump will host Putin anytime soon. \n \n The two leaders have met before, holding a pair of meetings last summer at the G-20 summit in Hamburg, Germany. Trump said at the time that he had pressed Putin on Russia\u2019s 2016 election meddling. \u201cI believe that he feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election,\u201d Trump said at the time. \n \n Trump startled G7 leaders earlier this month with his call for Russia\u2019s readmission to the group. Among the group\u2019s members, only Italy\u2019s new populist prime minister echoed that call. \n \n After his meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last week, Trump explained his thinking on the subject. \n \n \u201cI think it\u2019s better to have Russia in than out. Just like North Korea and everybody else, it\u2019s much better to get along with them than if we don\u2019t,\u201d Trump told reporters. \n \n Conley and other Russia experts say it\u2019s far more complicated. They pointed to Trump\u2019s fraying relationships with steadfast U.S. allies, which further deteriorated when the president reversed course and un-endorsed a joint statement backed by the other members of the G7 following a summit in Canada earlier this month. \n \n \u201cAt a time when we are really challenging our allies very forcefully, we are meeting adversaries and potentially offering them concessions,\u201d Conley said. \u201cIt\u2019s as if he\u2019s following President Putin\u2019s playbook.\u201d \n \n Annie Karni contributed to this report. ||||| WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Austrian capital, Vienna, is under consideration as the site of a potential summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, two sources familiar with the discussions said on Monday. \n \n FILE PHOTO: A combination of file photos showing Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Novo-Ogaryovo state residence outside Moscow, Russia, January 15, 2016 and U.S. President Donald Trump posing for a photo in New York City, U.S., May 17, 2016. REUTERS/Ivan Sekretarev/Pool/Lucas Jackson/File Photos \n \n The meeting could take place in advance of a July 11-12 NATO summit in Brussels that Trump is expected to attend, the sources said. Trump is also expected to visit London for talks with British Prime Minister Theresa May on the trip. \n \n Trump told reporters on Friday that it was possible that he would meet Putin this summer. During a Group of Seven summit in Quebec earlier this month, Trump suggested that Russia be readmitted to the group. The idea met with opposition from some other leaders at the meeting. \n \n Russia was suspended from the group in 2014 for its annexation of Crimea. \n \n \u201cI think it\u2019s better to have Russia in than to have Russia out, because just like North Korea, just like somebody else, it\u2019s much better if we get along with them than if we don\u2019t,\u201d Trump said on Friday. \n \n Trump, who has said he wants better relations with Russia, last met Putin in November in Vietnam on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific summit. \n \n Trump\u2019s defense secretary, Jim Mattis, was critical of Russia in a speech last week, saying: \u201cPutin seeks to shatter NATO, he aims to diminish the appeal of the Western democratic model and attempts to undermine America\u2019s moral authority.\u201d \n \n NATO was created after World War Two as a bulwark against the former Soviet Union. \n \n A probe of Russia\u2019s alleged involvement in the 2016 U.S. election has hung over Trump\u2019s presidency. U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating whether Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign colluded with Russia. \n \n Moscow denies meddling in the U.S. election and Trump denies any collusion took place. ||||| WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump hopes to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in the next few weeks even as the American leader increasingly clashes with European allies over how to counter Moscow\u2019s assertive actions in Europe and the Middle East. \n \n Mr. Trump is sending his national security adviser, John R. Bolton, to Moscow next week to discuss a possible meeting. Mr. Trump is already scheduled to attend a NATO summit meeting in Brussels next month, followed by a long-delayed visit to Britain. He could presumably add a stop in another country like Austria to see Mr. Putin. \n \n Mr. Trump has been eager to get together with Mr. Putin for months despite increasing tension in the relationship between Russia and the West. Just two weeks ago, Mr. Trump urged the rest of the Group of 7 major industrial powers to readmit Russia, which was expelled in 2014 after its armed seizure of Crimea from Ukraine. But the other members rejected the idea, deeming it inappropriate. \n \n By meeting with Mr. Putin on his own anyway, Mr. Trump would send a signal to European leaders that he does not intend to be held hostage to their approach to Moscow, adding another rupture to his fights with the United States\u2019 traditional allies over tariffs, security and migration. In recent public comments, he has emphasized the importance of building a friendly relationship with Mr. Putin and minimized the continuing dispute over Ukraine, blaming Russia\u2019s actions on former President Barack Obama.",

There are now reports of censors deleting hundreds of posts on the social networks Sina Weibo and Wechat, and some media organisations including CNN say parts of their websites have been blocked. \n \n \n \n The disclosures come amid Xi Jinping\u2019s crackdown on behaviour that could embarrass the Communist party. \n \n Two more well-connected figures \u2013 the brother of former vice-president Zeng Qinghong and the son of former politburo member Tian Jiyun \u2013 are directors of a single offshore company. They have previously been linked in a court case that highlighted how some Chinese \u201cprincelings\u201d have used political connections for financial gain. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Jia Qinglin is Jasmine Li\u2019s grandfather.

About a quarter of these are thought to be live: in 2015, records show the firm was collecting fees for nearly 10,000 companies linked to Hong Kong and China. The Mossack Fonseca franchise now has offices in eight Chinese cities, according to its website. \n \n There are many legitimate reasons to use offshore companies. Individuals living in multiple jurisdictions find them convenient, and in China they are often used as a way to attract and safeguard investment from overseas. While there is no indication of any wrongdoing, the leaks draw unwelcome attention to the wealth of leaders\u2019 families. In some cases, they show how secrecy havens are being used to create and hide potentially lucrative connections between big business and politics in the world\u2019s second-largest economy. \n \n Even as officials advertise their zeal in targeting corruption by hunting assets overseas and checking on the relatives of officials, they remain highly sensitive to the disclosure of the business interests of top leaders\u2019 families. \n \n In 2014, the websites of the Guardian and several other media outlets were blocked for several months after revealing such offshore holdings. Xi\u2019s brother-in-law Deng Jiagui and Li\u2019s daughter Li Xiaolin were named in those leaks, too. The new documents therefore indicate multiple offshore holdings. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Tian Jiyun is a former politburo member whose son is linked to an offshore company.

In December, he urged politburo members \u201cto strictly educate and supervise their children and other family members as well as subordinates, and to rectify their problems in a timely manner\u201d. He urged members of the 25-strong body to not only have integrity but \u201cstay away from vulgar taste and set good examples for other cadres and the general public\u201d. In other words, avoiding wrongdoing is not enough, impressions count, too. \n \n A world of hidden wealth: why we are shining a light offshore Read more \n \n Xi\u2019s daughter, Xi Mingze, studied at Harvard but kept a low profile, living under an assumed name.

They both existed for roughly 18 months before being closed in April 2011 and October 2010 respectively. \n \n The previous leak of offshore documents revealed Deng owned a 50% stake in the BVI-incorporated Excellence Effort Property Development. Ownership of the remainder of the company has been traced back to two Chinese property tycoons. \n \n Deng is married to Xi\u2019s older sister, and together they built a fortune through investments in property and natural resources. In 2012, they were reported to hold stakes in companies with total assets of $376m, and an indirect 18% share in a minerals company worth $2bn. Since Xi became president, they have pulled out of many of their investments. \n \n Thanks to his close connection to the centre of Chinese power, Deng qualifies as a PEP. Banks, registered agents and professionals such as lawyers are obliged to carry out detailed checks on the source of funds when managing money for politicians, public officials, their families and close associates. \n \n Deng was the named shareholder and had given the firm his Hong Kong identity papers. But Mossack Fonseca\u2019s files did not list him as a PEP, raising questions about whether detailed checks were made on what his offshore vehicles were used for.

Li and her husband, Liu Zhiyuan, were revealed as the beneficiaries of five bank accounts that together held as much as $2.48m in 2006-07. \n \n Li\u2019s identity became known to Mossack Fonseca when BVI regulators asked for information about Cofic in 2015, and inquiries were made with the Geneva law firm that represented it. Cofic\u2019s directors at this time were two partners in the firm, Charles-Andr\u00e9 Junod and Alain Bruno L\u00e9vy. Its shareholder, however, was a secretive Liechtenstein entity called Fondation Silo, whose beneficial owners were named by Junod as Li and her husband. \n \n When asked about his clients, Junod sent their passports to Mossack Fonseca with the following explanation: \u201cRegarding the source of funds, it is business profits: my clients have provided, through Cofic, services to other clients of my office who were exporting heavy industrial equipment from Europe to China.\u201d \n \n Cofic held a Swiss bank account at UBS and another with the asset manager Mirelis InvesTrust, the files show.

His younger brother, Zeng Qinghuai, is well known in Hong Kong, having worked there as an envoy for the ministry of culture. He was a consultant to Beginning of the Great Revival, a state-produced propaganda movie which, according to the New York Times, \u201cexemplified the hand-in-glove relationship between business and politics\u201d. Government offices and schools were ordered to buy tickets and any criticism was censored. State support ensured it was one of 2011\u2019s top grossing films. \n \n The Panama Papers reveal that Zeng Qinghuai is a director of a company called Chinese Cultural Exchange Association Ltd, registered first in the tiny South Pacific island of Niue, then in Samoa. He sits on the board alongside another princeling, Tian Chenggang, son of the former vice-premier and politburo member Tian Jiyun. \n \n A 2012 court case, in which Tian Chenggang unsuccessfully sued a developer called Beijing Henderson Properties, shed new light on the business dealings of the red nobility. The court in Hong Kong heard that Tian and a company linked to Zeng had been separately engaged to lobby regulators on behalf of Henderson when it was under investigation for breaching foreign exchange regulations in 2006. An exchange of letters disclosed in court suggested Tian\u2019s father had written to the regulators to plead leniency. In the event, the fine imposed was smaller than expected. \n \n Companies linked to Zeng received fees of $2.1m and $650,000. Henderson rejected Tian\u2019s demand for $5.5m, so Tian sued for the money but lost. The judge\u2019s summing up said of him: \u201cHe tried to project an air of superiority \u2026 His attitude was contemptuous and disrespectful.\u201d \n \n Zeng and Tian did not respond to requests for comment. \n \n \n \n The others \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Zhang Gaoli is one of China\u2019s seven most powerful politicians.

When the firm writes that \u201cwe have a strong compliance record\u201d and \u201cwe are responsible members of the global financial and business community,\u201d they are not lying through their teeth, as some might suspect. Keeping clients out of legal trouble is a core element of their business model: that is how they earn their money. If they, or firms like them, were to lose their reputations for keeping clients on the right side of the law, the clients would take their business elsewhere. \n \n Some of the activity uncovered in the Panama Papers will turn out to be illegal. But if past is prologue, then the majority of what we learn from the leak will merely be embarrassing for those exposed\u2014showing them to be opportunistic and perhaps unethical, but not criminal. And that is why many of the people named in the documents are unlikely to see the inside of a courtroom concerning the services that Mossack Fonseca provided to them: not because they have the power now to quash prosecutions (with some notable exceptions!), but because some time ago they had the power to hire expert advisers who carefully designed their tax-avoidance (or law-avoidance) strategies. \n \n This kind of expertise is expensive, and can run into hundreds of thousands of dollars per year, depending on which laws one wants to avoid. But paying for secrecy is typically worth it: If it weren\u2019t for leaks like the Panama Papers, most people would have no idea that so much law avoidance is possible, let alone legally permitted. Many governments know about it, and as the Panama Papers reveal, many public officials take advantage of the benefits these firms provide. \n \n That is one reason so many of their names appear in the leak: 140 politicians and officials from more than 50 countries. While some of those countries are known to have problems with fraud and crime by individuals in government, others are not. Iceland, France, Chile, and Botswana\u2014all of which have officials listed as clients of Mossack Fonseca\u2014are ranked highly on anti-corruption indexes such as the one from Transparency International. Use of offshore services by officials from those countries is unlikely to be connected to illegal activity, although it may well become a political liability for them. \n \n That is how things shaped up for Icelandic Prime Minister Sigmundur Gunnlaugsson, who resigned following revelations that he was once part-owner of an offshore company incorporated with the help of Mossack Fonseca. Although the firm has been wholly owned by his wife since 2009, it stands to reap millions from the deal Gunnlaugsson negotiated for claimants on Iceland\u2019s bankrupt financial institutions. Although reports show \u201cno evidence to suggest tax avoidance, evasion, or any dishonest financial gain on the part of Gunnlaugsson,\u201d his mere association with Mossack Fonseca and an offshore firm was enough to cost him his job, and possibly his career. ||||| The provocative revelations coming out of the so-called Panama Papers are just a glimpse into the murky global network that's keeping \"absolutely astonishing\" amounts of money out of public coffers. \n \n The 11.5 million files taken from Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca show how the financial elite exploit a secretive system to manoeuvre wealth anonymously and ensure the taxman doesn't take his cut. \n \n The firm is \"the world's fourth biggest provider of offshore services,\" according to the Guardian, with about $42 million in yearly revenue. The documents contain information about more than 214,000 shell companies, trusts and foundations \u2014 usually used to hold or transfer financial assets while obfuscating the identity of their real owner \u2014 that were registered with the firm. \n \n \"That gives a sense of the tremendous scope of this in terms of the flows of money into these largely mysterious companies, and this is only one firm,\" says Nicholas Shaxson, an investigative journalist and author of Treasure Islands: Tax Havens and the Men who Stole the World. \n \n It's difficult to delineate what constitutes a tax haven but it's generally agreed that, depending on the criteria, there are between 70 and 92 of them worldwide. And there's an estimated two million shell companies registered with offshore firms in these states. \n \n (CBC) \n \n \"For a long time, people thought of tax havens as an exotic sideshow of the world economy. Now it's clear they are absolutely central to it. We're talking about absolutely astonishing, mind-boggling amounts of money,\" Shaxson says. \n \n Estimates of how much wealth is currently stashed offshore vary considerably, a reflection of the opacity of an industry that some economists contend has grown exponentially in recent decades. \n \n Gabriel Zucman, author of The Hidden Wealth of Nations and a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, puts the figure at least $7.6 trillion. \n \n But the Tax Justice Network, an international research and advocacy organization, says the number is far greater. The group estimates that as of 2010, there was between $21 and $32 trillion kept in offshore holdings. That would represent between eight and 13 per cent of total global wealth. \n \n Resource drain \n \n Perhaps most troubling, according to one economist, is that somewhere in the ballpark of $1 trillion is illegally funneled out of developing nations each year into mysterious shell companies. \n \n It's a system that bolsters kleptocracy and corruption, says Matt Salomon, chief economist with Global Financial Integrity. \n \n \"It's a real resource drain in countries where the money is needed most. At the same time, wealthier nations are standing by as this is happening, insisting that they support development in these places,\" he says. \n \n \"It's possible that the $1-trillion figure only represents a drop in the bucket since the data is so murky.\" \n \n Many of the dealings facilitated by offshore firms are entirely legal and are encouraged by major financial institutions the world over. Canada's biggest lender, RBC, was named in the Panama Papers, having used Mossack Fonseca to set up at least 370 shell companies for clients. \n \n It's estimated that about $1 trillion is funnelled out of developing countries each year. Money generated from major natural resource extraction projects, for example, can be siphoned off and hidden in offshore accounts. (Thierry Gouegnon/Reuters) \n \n There's a searing public anger over a system that so blatantly favours the wealthy and operates with near impunity, says Shaxson. It's putting pressure on governments to finally crack down on tax dodgers that cost countries billions each year. \n \n Canada alone loses between $6 and $7.8 billion annually to offshore tax havens, according to a report in the Toronto Star. In response, the federal government dedicated $440 million over four years in the 2016 budget to probe tax evasion and what the Canada Revenue Agency called \"aggressive tax avoidance.\" \n \n Even before the Panama Papers prompted public outrage though, more than 100 countries since 2014 had committed to increasing transparency around the financial holdings of foreign customers. \n \n The U.S. is among the countries resisting these changes. States like Delaware, Nevada and South Dakota allow for levels of anonymity and secrecy that \"rival any of the countries we usually think of as tax havens,\" says James Henry, former chief economist at the consulting firm McKinsey. \n \n 'The level of anger is higher than ever' \n \n \"It's insufficient to just say 'offshore tax havens' because the industry has expanded so aggressively to countries around the globe,\" adds Henry, now a fellow at Columbia and Yale. \n \n Despite big promises from governments, real reform will not come easily. Tax havens and all the perks that come with them \"are the projects of some of the world's wealthiest people,\" says Shaxson. \n \n 'People are beginning to realize how extensive the offshore system is, and there is a rapidly rising public anger over that,' says Nicholas Shaxson. Protesters in Iceland called for the resignation of the country's prime minister after the Panama Papers revealed he had offshore accounts that he allegedly never disclosed. (Stigtryggur Johannsson/Reuters) \n \n There's a lot of money to be made by interests with considerable political clout, Henry notes, and the very nature of the business makes it difficult for so-called crackdowns to be effective. Financial institutions rarely face any significant consequences, and past investigations have ended up completely toothless. \n \n \"Look, for decades, governments have known about this, law enforcement have known about this and the response has been pretty pathetic. I think the reasons for that are pretty clear at this point,\" Henry says. \n \n \"But the level of anger is higher than ever, and it will probably only intensify as more stories come out of the leak.\" ||||| Image copyright AFP Image caption President Juan Carlos Varela is determined to ensure Panama's reputation is not besmirched by the scandal \n \n Panama is creating an international panel to help improve transparency in its offshore financial industry. \n \n The move follows the leak of millions of documents from law firm Mossack Fonseca, showing it helped some clients evade tax and avoid sanctions. \n \n Several countries are probing possible financial crimes by the rich and powerful in the aftermath of the leak. \n \n President Juan Carlos Varela said Panama would work with other countries over the revelations. \n \n \"The Panamanian government, via our foreign ministry, will create an independent commission of domestic and international experts,\" he said in a televised address. \n \n Image copyright Reuters Image caption The leaks from Mossack Fonseca's offices in Panama have created a worldwide media storm \n \n The panel, he said, would examine working practices and propose measures that could be shared to strengthen the transparency of the financial and legal systems. \n \n Correspondents say the president is eager to defend his country against a \"media attack\" by wealthy countries that he says are unfairly stigmatising him following the leak. \n \n Are you in Panama?

(Associated Press) \n \n BERLIN (AP) \u2014 The German newspaper that first obtained the so-called Panama Papers, a vast trove of documents on offshore companies, said Thursday that it won't publish all the files, arguing that not all are of public interest. \n \n Sueddeutsche Zeitung received the documents from an unidentified source more than a year ago and shared at least parts of them with dozens of other media outlets around the world. Since the first reports were published Sunday, prominent politicians, celebrities and businesspeople have had their offshore business dealings dragged into the spotlight, prompting a flurry of public outrage, official investigations and fierce denials from some of those named. \n \n Sueddeutsche Zeitung said the complete set of 11.5 million documents \"won't be made available to the public or to law enforcement agencies. That's because the SZ isn't the extended arm of prosecutors or the tax investigators.\" \n \n Authorities have legal powers to obtain such documents from those suspected of wrongdoing, and in many cases there's no public interest in revealing companies' or individuals' offshore business dealings, the Munich-based paper said. \n \n The documents relate to Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, which helps create shell companies for the world's rich and famous. The firm said it has filed a criminal complaint alleging that the data was stolen in a hacking attack. \n \n Sueddeutsche Zeitung said it didn't know how the anonymous source obtained the data, but that he or she had expressed \"a very strong moral impulse\" and wanted to make \"these crimes public.\" \n \n Panama's government on Wednesday accused wealthy nations of unfairly attacking the Central American country while ignoring their own failings. \n \n President Juan Carlos Varela said an international committee of experts would be created to recommend ways to boost transparency in the Central American country's offshore financial industry. Experts say that while offshore companies can be used for tax evasion and money laundering, there are also legitimate and legal grounds for creating them. \n \n German lawmakers said Thursday they plan to hold an urgent debate on the offshore leaks next week. \n \n \"The revelations in the Panama Papers have triggered a broad discussion among politicians and the public about necessary consequences,\" said Christine Lambrecht, a lawmaker for the Social Democratic Party that is part of Chancellor Angela Merkel's governing coalition. \n \n Responding to readers' queries about the absence of prominent German or American politicians in the reports, Sueddeutsche Zeitung said such names haven't yet been found in the documents. \n \n It said the documents include copies of the passports of 200 Americans, and about 3,500 shareholders in offshore companies listed addresses in the United States. \n \n \"One possible reason why comparatively few Americans appear in the documents could be that U.S. citizens have no reason to contact a law firm in Panama,\" the paper said. \"That's because offshore companies can easily be created in U.S. states such as Wyoming, Delaware or Nevada.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The newspaper that first received the Panama Papers says it isn't going to release all 11.5 million files it received from a whistleblower to the public or to law enforcement\u2014because it \"isn't the extended arm of prosecutors or the tax investigators.\" Sueddeutsche Zeitung has shared files relating to celebrities and politicians, but the German paper doesn't believe there's public interest in exposing all of the individuals and companies involved, the AP reports. The paper says it was contacted by a source at Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca who felt a \"very strong moral impulse\" to expose the tax evasion and money laundering the firm facilitated with its creation of thousands of offshore shell companies. In other coverage: Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela, apparently unhappy with his country's name appearing in headlines about financial crimes all over the world, has promised to boost transparency and clean up the industry, the BBC reports. He says the country will bring in international experts to recommend changes. The Guardian looks at how the scandal has exposed China's \"red nobility\"\u2014wealthy families connected to the Communist Party. Prominent figures named in the papers include the brother-in-law of President Xi Jinping. Unsurprisingly, the scandal is not being reported in China, and censors have been trying to scrub every mention of it from social media. The CBC looks at how the wealth revealed in the leak is just a fraction of what an analyst calls \"absolutely astonishing, mind-boggling amounts of money\" tied up in offshore funds. Estimates run as high as $31 trillion, or 13% of global wealth, much of which is being kept in offshore funds to cheat governments out of tax revenue\u2014or to hide the plunder of national resources. The New York Times looks at the history of the Mossack Fonseca firm and its role in Panama's economy. Co-founder Ramon Fonseca had been trying to expand his role in the country's government, claiming he wanted to improve the nation's human rights record. At the Atlantic, Brooke Harrington examines the legal issues involved and concludes that the real scandal isn't the law-breaking\u2014it's that so much of what Mossack Fonseca did was perfectly legal.",

    "document": "Police in Mexico's southern Chiapas state found 513 migrants on Tuesday inside two trailer trucks bound for the United States, and said they had been transported in dangerously crowded conditions. \n \n Migrants who were found in two trailer trucks bound for the United States, sit under the guard of a policeman in Tuxtla Gutierrez, Mexico, Tuesday May 17, 2011. Chiapas authorities say they rescued 513... (Associated Press) \n \n Some of the immigrants were suffering from dehydration after traveling for hours clinging to cargo ropes strung inside the containers to keep them upright as the trucks bounced along from the Guatemalan border, and allow more migrants to be more crammed in on the floor. \n \n The trucks had air holes punched in the tops of the containers, but migrants interviewed at the state prosecutors' office said they lacked air and water. The trucks were bound for the central city of Puebla, where the migrants said they had been told they would be loaded aboard a second set of vehicles for the trip to the U.S. border. \n \n \"We were suffering, it was very hot and we were clinging to the ropes,\" said Mario, a 23-year-old Honduran migrant who identified himself only by his first name, for security reasons. Mexico's National Human Rights Commission says thousands of undocumented migrants are kidnapped and held for ransom by drug gangs in Mexico each year. \n \n None of the migrants would say whether any drug gang had been involved in the mass smuggling scheme broken up early Tuesday when Chiapas state police discovered the migrants while using X-ray equipment on the trucks at a checkpoint in the outskirts of city of Tuxtla Gutierrez. \n \n The migrants said the smugglers were charging them about $7,000 apiece to get them into the United States. A Guatemalan migrant who identified himself as Juan said remaining in his hometown in Guatemala was not an option, noting \"a lot of us are Indians, and we can't stay in our homes. There is no work, and there's nothing to eat.\" \n \n An agent for the National Immigration Institute who was not authorized to be quoted by name said it was the largest shipment of migrants detained in Mexico in recent years. \n \n Police also arrested four people accused of smuggling the migrants, who are from Central and South America and Asia, Chiapas state prosecutors said in a statement. \n \n The alleged smugglers tried to escape police but were chased down and captured, prosecutors said. \n \n The immigration institute said in a statement that 410 of the migrants were from Guatemala, 47 from El Salvador, 32 from Ecuador, 12 from India, six from Nepal, three from China and one each from Japan, the Dominican Republic and Honduras. There were 32 women and four children among them. \n \n In January, Chiapas state authorities discovered 219 migrants squeezed into a trailer truck. \n \n Most of those migrants were from Central America but six were from Sri Lanka and four from Nepal. ||||| Government of Chiapas, via European Pressphoto Agency \n \n When police ran X-ray scanners over two cargo trucks at a checkpoint in southeastern Mexico on Tuesday, they made a surprising discovery: Inside the trailer were the ghostly shadows of 513 migrants \u2014 some suffering from dehydration \u2014 packed together in near-suffocating conditions. \n \n The police released an image of the harrowing scan, which shows how migrants sat in tight bundles or stood clutching cargo straps for hours of clandestine travel from beyond Mexico\u2019s border with Guatemala. \n \n Their capture thwarted what appeared to be one of the largest single shipments of illegal migrants found in recent years, The Associated Press reported. And it drew attention to the increasing use of X-ray scanners by border security and police officers to inspect vehicles on the road \u2014 not to mention the power of these machines to create frightful, captivating images. \n \n Scanners of the type used to inspect the trucks in Mexico, known as backscatter scanners, are widely employed to check cargo for weapons and drugs, and also to catch human smuggling. They are similar to the ones now frequently used at airports around the United States to screen passengers. Critics have objected that the images created by these machines \u2014 which penetrate normal clothing and can be highly detailed \u2014 are a violation of travelers\u2019 privacy. (Remember the failed protest against the scanners last year?) \n \n No similar controversy attends their use on cargo, though. Fixed and mobile scanners have been used for years everywhere from Europe to the war in Iraq for that purpose. \n \n Here\u2019s a video of one type of scanner inspecting trucks in Chile (the audio has been removed): \n \n As Andy Greenberg wrote on Forbes.com last year, \u201cthe same technology, capable of seeing through clothes and walls, has also been rolling out on U.S. streets.\u201d He continues: \n \n American Science & Engineering, a company based in Billerica, Massachusetts, has sold U.S. and foreign government agencies more than 500 backscatter X-ray scanners mounted in vans that can be driven past neighboring vehicles to see their contents, Joe Reiss, a vice president of marketing at the company told me in an interview. While the biggest buyer of AS&E\u2019s machines over the last seven years has been the Department of Defense operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, Reiss says law enforcement agencies have also deployed the vans to search for vehicle-based bombs in the U.S. \n \n Still, the image captured on Tuesday is among the starkest to surface publicly so far. It opens an eerie black-and-white window into a world where $7,000 buys a small patch of space in a cramped truck with breathing holes punched in the roof, but no guarantee of making it all the way to the United States. \n \n This post has been revised to reflect the following correction: \n \n Correction: May 18, 2011 \n \n An earlier version of this post's headline mistakenly referred to the migrants as Mexican.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Mexican police saw something shocking when they aimed their X-ray scanners at a pair of tractor trailers at a checkpoint in Chiapas. The trucks were jammed full of 513 illegal migrants, many of them suffering from dehydration, the AP reports. Though air holes had been cut in the top of the trucks, the migrants said they felt suffocated as well. \u201cWe were suffering,\u201d one said. \u201cIt was very hot, and we were clinging to the ropes.\u201d The migrants hailed from throughout South America, Central America, and even Asia, and were bound for the US. Some said they were charged around $7,000 for the trip. Mexican authorities say it was their largest migrant smuggling bust in years. The type of scanner that spotted the migrants was, interestingly enough, similar to the devices so reviled by airline passengers, the New York Times notes.",

    "document": "Photo \n \n First, there was old-fashioned gambling on football. Then came the fantasy leagues. And now, thanks to Wall Street, fans can buy a stake in their favorite player. \n \n On Thursday, a start-up company announced a new trading exchange for investors to buy and sell interests in professional athletes. Backed by executives from Silicon Valley, Wall Street and the sports world, the company plans to create stocks tied to an athlete\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s financial performance. \n \n After considering a number of possibilities for its inaugural initial public offering, the company found a charismatic candidate in Arian Foster, the Pro Bowl running back of the Houston Texans. Investors in the deal will receive stock linked to Mr. Foster\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s future earnings, which includes the value of his playing contracts, corporate endorsements and appearance fees. \n \n The company, Fantex Holdings, has grand ambitions beyond a Foster I.P.O. \u201a\u00c4\u0112 it hopes to sign up more football players and other athletes, as well as celebrities like pop singers and Hollywood actors. \n \n But if such an investment sounds speculative, that is because it is. In a filing for the Foster deal with securities regulators, Fantex laid out 37 pages of risk factors, including a possible career-ending injury or a performance slump. \n \n \u201a\u00c4\u00faYou are potentially one hit away from losing your money,\u201a\u00c4\u011a said Bradley Shear, a sports management professor at George Washington University. \u201a\u00c4\u00faOn any given Sunday, anything can happen to any player.\u201a\u00c4\u011a \n \n Risks aside, the offering is intended to capitalize on the mammoth popularity of the National Football League and fantasy football, where fans draft players and score points for touchdowns, yardage and other notable plays during the season. \n \n If thousands of fans are willing to pay as much as $250 for an Arian Foster jersey, the thinking goes, why wouldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t they pay up for a few shares of Arian Foster stock? \n \n Brian McCarthy, a spokesman for the N.F.L., declined to comment on the deal. \n \n A market of star athletes calls to mind other unusual investments tied to entertainers. In the late 1990s, a financier created Bowie Bonds, a small bond issue that paid interest from the current and future revenue of 25 albums by the rock musician David Bowie. The brokerage firm Cantor Fitzgerald runs the Hollywood Stock Exchange, a marketplace for bets on the fortunes of movies and their stars, but participants use only play money. \n \n Fantex wants its venture to be anything but make-believe. Investors can now register with the company and soon place orders for the I.P.O. The company will market the I.P.O. in the coming weeks, offering 1.06 million shares at $10 a share, or $10.6 million worth of stock. If demand is insufficient, the company may cancel the deal. \n \n As for Mr. Foster, he will receive a $10 million payment from Fantex upon consummation of the offering. (The balance of the I.P.O. covers the deal\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s costs.) In exchange for the payment, Mr. Foster has promised to pay Fantex 20 percent of his future earnings. \n \n The company is effectively financing the $10 million payment to Mr. Foster by raising money from retail investors in an I.P.O. In its filings, Fantex says it believes that the stock is intended to track the economic performance of Mr. Foster\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s future brand income. \n \n Still, shareholders will not have a direct investment in Mr. Foster or any control over his brand. The company did say it expected to pay a dividend to holders of the Foster stock. \n \n Shares will trade exclusively on an exchange operated by Fantex. The tracking stock will increase in value if Mr. Foster raises his earnings potential with standout play or increased sponsorships. \n \n Then, the investor can try to sell his shares at a higher price. Fantex will make a 1 percent commission from both the buyer and seller on the trades. \n \n Buck French, the company\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s co-founder and chief executive, demurred when asked to predict how the stock might behave in a secondary market. \n \n \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t know how it will trade,\u201a\u00c4\u011a he said. \n \n A graduate of West Point and Harvard Business School, Mr. French made a fortune during the dot-com boom when, in 2000, he sold OnLink, a software company he founded, to Siebel Systems for about $600 million. One of his Fantex co-founders, David M. Beirne, was a general partner at Benchmark Capital, the venture capital firm that was one of eBay\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s earliest investors. \n \n Mr. French said Mr. Beirne conceived of the Fantex concept more than a decade ago when working on a sports-related venture with John Elway, the former Denver Broncos quarterback. \n \n \u201a\u00c4\u00faFantex represents a powerful new opportunity for professional athletes, and I wish it were available during my playing days,\u201a\u00c4\u011a Mr. Elway, a member of Fantex\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s board, said in a statement. \n \n Wall Street executives have also joined the company. Fantex\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s president is John Rodin, co-president of the hedge fund Glenview Capital Management and a Goldman Sachs alumnus. Its chief technology officer is Joshua S. Levine, a former senior executive at E*Trade and Deutsche Bank. \n \n A big question is whether other athletes are on the sidelines awaiting a Fantex I.P.O. Mr. French declined to discuss future deals. \n \n On one hand, athletes and their agents could view Fantex as a compelling proposition, providing athletes with a large upfront payment for giving up a certain percentage of their future earnings. Such a payment could act as a hedge against an unexpected downturn in a player\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s career. \n \n But advisers could counsel against trading a piece of their future earnings for a big lump sum, as some athletes are notorious for squandering money. \n \n Other considerations are the specter of insider trading violations, and complying with the federal securities laws. Mr. Foster, his friends and his financial team will have to be especially circumspect when discussing issues that might affect his earnings. \n \n A fifth-year veteran from the University of Tennessee, Mr. Foster, 27, has led all running backs in rushing touchdowns two of the last three seasons, while racking up well over 1,000 yards each year. In March 2012, Houston signed Mr. Foster to a contract worth up to $43.5 million over five years. He has a handful of endorsement contracts, including with Under Armour and Kroger Texas. \n \n Half Mexican-American, half black, Mr. Foster is a crowd favorite and media darling who trumpets his passions for poetry and yoga. When he scores, he clasps his hands together and strikes a namaste pose. \n \n \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe see Arian as a unique, multidimensional individual, a trailblazer,\u201a\u00c4\u011a said Mr. French, who added that Fantex cold-called Mr. Foster\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s agent to pitch the idea. \n \n Yet during the first six weeks of this season, Mr. Foster\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s production has flagged. He has just one rushing touchdown. Heading into the year, there was concern over various injuries. Off the field, Foster admitted in a documentary released in September that he potentially violated N.C.A.A. rules by accepting money when he was a college player. \n \n Those issues underscore the risk of betting on Mr. Foster\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s brand, or that of any professional athletes, especially N.F.L. players. Unlike some other sports, N.F.L. contracts often are not fully guaranteed, meaning players are often cut and forced to find a new team, sometimes for a lesser contract. \n \n For investors, the long-term outlook for a player will be difficult to handicap. If a player\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s fortunes suffer and the tracking stock declines, there will be no rescue financing from a private equity firm \u201a\u00c4\u0112 or an investor like Warren E. Buffett \u201a\u00c4\u0112 to stabilize the share price. \n \n And unlike a stockholder of a public company, investors have no corporate governance rights. \n \n There are no plans to hold annual meetings with the athlete, or quarterly conference calls. \n \n Despite all the risks, some football fans appear poised to buy in. As one tweeted on Thursday after reading the news: \u201a\u00c4\u00faWow. This is awesome.\u201a\u00c4\u011a ||||| Photo: Jeff Gross/Getty Images \n \n There was a time, not too long ago, when a fool who wandered into the world of investments could very well be separated from his money with the help of any number of dumb, overpriced, or downright fraudulent schemes. Then, in 2008, the economy went into freefall, and everyone who had money left held onto their checkbooks a little more tightly. Fear bred caution, and some of the worst offenders in the dumb-money chase were forced to close up shop, or at least become a little more discreet about their advantage-taking. \n \n Now, with five years of air between Lehman Brothers and the present, the seal has been lifted. Athletes and virtual currencies are being traded alongside Ford and General Electric. Venture capitalists are pitching start-up stocks to the unwashed masses. And later today, the SEC is expected to propose new rules that will make it even easier for companies to fleece the unsuspecting public. \n \n Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the age of bullshit investments is back. \n \n Look around today\u2019s markets and you\u2019ll see a surfeit of senseless investment opportunities wearing the cloak of legitimacy. \n \n You\u2019ll see, on page one of the New York Times, a start-up called Fantex touting a new investment vehicle that allows fans of NFL running back Arian Foster to support his career by purchasing stock that gives them a share of his future earnings. (What didn\u2019t make page one: Foster\u2019s career-worst game the very next Sunday.) This investment opportunity, which will appeal mainly to those too young to remember Bowie Bonds, is a terrible idea on multiple fronts: It bases returns on the unpredictable performance of professional athletes, it gives stock that can only be traded on a private, relatively illiquid exchange, and its single-athlete stock can be converted into common Fantex stock whenever the company feels like it. \n \n Look harder, and you\u2019ll see companies like Goldman Sachs throwing millions of dollars at hare-brained schemes like Motif Investing, a \u201ctheme-based stock investment platform\u201d that allows rank amateurs to make up \u201cmotifs\u201d of stocks they think are going to behave in a certain, coordinated way. (Professional stock traders do this all the time, without calling it a \u201cmotif\u201d strategy \u2014 but they don\u2019t charge ordinary people what can amount to double-digit fees, nor do they base their investment decisions on \u201cCompanies with lots of Facebook likes,\u201d as Motif suggests.) \n \n You\u2019ll see Bitcoins, the everlasting fascination of Silicon Valley crypto-geeks, being not only spoken about as an investment-grade commodity despite having higher volatility than your average Baldwin brother, but inspiring entire investment vehicles (one of which is structured by celebrity twins) that give ordinary investors as well as the tech-savvy crowd the chance to lose money when the fad runs its course. You\u2019ll also see art dealers trying to convince you that betting on the paintings of unknown artists is a sound portfolio move. \n \n Some of these bad ideas spring from the normal irrational exuberance that comes with an economic bounce-back, and the fact that many investors are more willing to jump into murky waters than they were in 2008. But there are other factors in play, too. The JOBS Act, for one, was a post-crisis law that was meant to make it easier for companies to raise money. Instead, by paving the way for equity crowdfunding and making it possible for private investors to hawk their services like Cracker Jack vendors at Yankee Stadium, the law opened a Pandora\u2019s box of truly unwise investments. \n \n Thanks to the JOBS Act, there are now crowd-funding bazaars that make gambling in the markets as easy as picking a Spotify playlist. There\u2019s also the newest West Coast fund-raising trend, the venture capital syndicate, which makes it possible for average shmoes with little to no market expertise to enter into highly risky investments with early stage start-ups, and which has put the sentence \u201cMiley Cyrus could be the next big tech investor\u201d within the realm of the possible. \n \n There\u2019s a lot to take in, between the NFL-stock-trading and the Miley Cyrus venture capital buffoonery. But the upshot is that between the rise of the social web, the recovering economy, and the deregulatory impact of the JOBS Act, it\u2019s now easier than ever for you to lose money in fun-sounding ways. This is fine if you have disposable income to spare, which many of the people who meet the SEC\u2019s threshold for being an \u201caccredited investor\u201d (someone with a $1 million net worth or an individual annual income of $200,000) do. But other accredited investors are doctors, lawyers, and workaday tech nerds who know next to nothing about the stock markets, but are gullible enough when flashy investments are shined in their faces. For these people, no number of \u201ctreat it as casino money\u201d caveats will suffice; they will inevitably succumb to the pitch, and they will lose money. \n \n I\u2019m not the only one noticing that things are getting dangerous. Felix Salmon says that years of near-zero interest rates and the JOBS Act gold rush mean that \u201ceven the smart money has started funding companies at utterly bonkers valuations.\u201d Josh Brown, a financial advisor and CNBC regular, told me in an e-mail that the \u201cludicrous\u201d investing climate \u201cis a byproduct of the giddiness we\u2019re seeing amongst the owners of financial assets. We\u2019ve eclipsed the 2007 peak of household net worth but the makeup is very different. More has accrued to the upper echelon and the lesson that group has learned about the nature of investing is that even if we blow up, the Fed and Congress will ensure that come out of it in even better shape.\u201d And the SEC has been busting record numbers of petty thefts and boiler-room schemes \u2014 many of which reflect the intersection of well-intentioned but underinformed investors with slick profiteers claiming to have access to the next big thing. \n \n The truly scary part of what\u2019s happening now is that it\u2019s not a particular asset bubble, nor the sketchy practices of a coterie of bankers, that\u2019s endangering the investment portfolios of normal people. It\u2019s the deregulated system itself that poses the threat. Unlike in 2008, this exuberance won\u2019t end in a sudden crash, brought on by shady practices at large investment firms. It will be a slow flow of assets from the information-deprived to the information-rich, in the form of fees and other completely legal wealth transfers. \n \n Whatever the cause \u2014 be it interest rates or income inequality, the JOBS Act or simply the state of the S&P and the folly of man \u2014 make no mistake: The investment environment is as hostile to ordinary investors as it\u2019s been in many years. The best course of action is simply to do very little \u2014 to invest in low-cost index funds, or just follow Harold Pollack\u2019s now-famous Financial Advice Index Card. But if you must invest in things beyond the ordinary and boring, watch your wallet: Your next big mistake may be just around the corner. ||||| Bitcoins may be getting a lot of buzz, but the market for products that deal with old fashioned dollars and cents is apparently still strong. \n \n To wit: Motif Investing, the Silicon Valley startup headed up by Microsoft alum Hardeep Walia that lets people invest their money in themed groups of stocks called \u201cmotifs\u201d, has raised $25 million in a new round of funding led by Goldman Sachs. \n \n This counts as a Series C round for Motif, bringing the total amount of money invested in the company to $51 million since it was founded in mid-2010. All of Motif\u2019s previous investors, including Ignition Partners, Norwest Venture Partners and Foundation Capital, also pitched into this new round. As part of the investment Darren Cohen, Goldman\u2019s managing director of principal strategic investments, is joining Motif\u2019s board as an observer. \n \n In an interview this week, Walia told me that Motif\u2019s growth has been strong since it officially launched its platform to the public last summer. To date more than 7500 \u201cmotifs\u201d have been created, which are investment indexes that let people invest in genres such as \u201cBiotech Breakthrough\u201d or \u201cHousing Recovery\u201d as opposed to buying individual stocks or putting complete trust in a mutual fund or ETF. \n \n Motif, which Walia bills as a \u201cFacebook meets eTrade meets Mint.com,\u201d does not collect management fees, which is another thing that sets it apart from traditional money management vehicles. It makes money by charging a flat $9.95 fee to make a motif (which can include up to 30 stocks) and in several other ways, such as collecting margins on investments and selling value-added services and products. In the months since launch, the platform has attracted a diverse user base ranging from \u201cultra high-net-worth individuals\u201d who primarily appreciate that Motif does not charge management fees, to \u201cnewbie investors\u201d who appreciate the site\u2019s natural language approach, Walia says. \n \n With the fresh Series C funds, Walia says that Motif will work on further developing its product for financial advisors, which will let professional consultants use Motif\u2019s investment platform with their own clients. There are other new products in the works, as well, he says. Motif\u2019s own staff, meanwhile, has grown to 40 full-time employees, and the funding will also be used to continue to add talent (with a special focus, not surprisingly, on engineering.) \n \n When asked about strategic options \u2014 after all, Goldman Sachs doesn\u2019t exactly invest in companies without an eye on getting a return \u2014 Walia said that he\u2019s focused on building Motif as \u201ca company that lasts and is independent, so that we can continue to disrupt this space.\u201d \n \n That said, Walia, whose resume includes time on the M&A team at Microsoft, did acknowledge that Motif could make sense as an acquisition target, especially for established entities that deal in ETFs, stock brokering, and financial services. \u201cA lot of people have found what we do quite fascinating\u2026 we are very attractive to certain players.\u201d For now, though, Motif certainly has the vision \u2014 and funding \u2014 necessary to continue to grow as a standalone entity, and it should continue to be one to watch at the intersection of finance and technology.",

    "document": "The parents of first lady Melania Trump became naturalized U.S. citizens on Thursday, taking the oath in a private ceremony in New York, according to their attorney. \n \n Viktor and Amalija Knavs are originally from Slovenia but have lived in the United States for over a decade, during which time they gained permanent legal residency, said Michael Wildes, the couple's immigration lawyer. \n \n Wildes told reporters the couple \"have travailed a wonderful journey like millions have, in getting citizenship and waiting the requisite period of time.\" \n \n He said that despite having the president of the United States for a son-in-law, the Knavses followed a process to gain their citizenship that \"was no different than anybody else's.\" \n \n The White House declined to comment on the Knavses' newly acquired citizenship status, saying they were \"not part of the administration and deserve privacy.\" \n \n After living between Trump Tower and Mar-a-Lago for several years, Viktor and Amalija Knavs reportedly moved to the Washington suburbs following Trump's inauguration,and are frequently spotted traveling with the first lady and the Trumps' son, Barron Trump. \n \n The question of how the Knavses originally gained their green cards has become a controversial one since Trump won the presidency on an anti-immigration platform. Trump has frequently railed against the family visa system, or so-called chain migration, which permits U.S. citizens to sponsor their family members for visas. \n \n Even so, experts say chain migration is the most likely way the Knavses gained their permanent residency in the United States. ||||| (CNN) President Donald Trump's in-laws are officially United States citizens, obtaining their citizenship through the sponsorship of their adult daughter, one of the very categories of family visas that the administration has sought to end. \n \n \"It went well and they are very grateful and appreciative of this wonderful day for their family,\" he said in a statement to CNN. \n \n The first lady's office declined to comment. \n \n Viktor and Amalija Knavs, who are from Slovenia, had been living in the United States with green cards and have been frequently spotted in Washington since their son-in-law assumed the presidency. \n \n A source with direct knowledge of Melania Trump's parents and their immigration status told CNN that Melania Trump sponsored her parents for their green cards, a status that allowed them to live and work in the US indefinitely and paved the way for citizenship. That type of family visa is exactly one of the categories that Trump and his allies have tried to repeal, saying they are harmful to the US. \n \n Wildes wouldn't comment on how the Knavs received their green cards or citizenship Thursday, but criticized the Trump administration's immigration policies to CNN. \n \n \"I believe strongly in the principles of family reunification, which is a bedrock of immigration policy and law and has brought millions of people happily to our shores,\" Wildes said. \n \n Pressed on the fact that the President has harshly criticized family-based migration and regularly refers to it as \"chain migration,\" Wildes responded: \"I can't comment on the President's politics when it comes to my clients but I have stood up against the President's immigration policies personally.\" \n \n There are only a handful of ways that immigrants to the US can obtain green cards, and the largest share of them each year are given out based on familial connections. A smaller number go to immigrants based on their employment, and other categories include refugees and other special cases. Advocates for restricting legal immigration have pointed to the imbalance in favor of family connections as evidence of the need for reform, calling for a \"merit-based\" system that would choose immigrants based on need in the US. \n \n The US allows a number of ways for US citizens and legal permanent residents to sponsor family members to come to the US permanently, including categories for parents, adult siblings and adult children, married and unmarried. \n \n Trump and his congressional allies have fought to slash that dramatically, limiting sponsorship to spouses and minor children, including dropping the threshold for minor children from 21 to 18. Experts estimate that could cut overall immigration to the US by 40% to 50%, if those green cards are not reallocated to another category. Trump has advocated a \"merit-based\" system, but has not proposed any method of admitting immigrants to the US to replace those categories. \n \n Viktor and Amalija Knavs, 73 and 71 years old, respectively, are retired, and they maintain regular contact with the Trump family, often traveling with the first family on trips to Mar-a-Lago and Bedminster, New Jersey.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The US gained two new citizens of note on Thursday: Viktor and Amalija Knavs, parents of first lady Melania Trump. The couple are natives of Slovenia, where they raised Melania, but have been in the US for more than a decade, says their immigration lawyer, per CNBC. Their path to citizenship \"was no different than anybody else's,\" adds Michael Wildes. The couple reportedly live in the DC suburbs and are frequently seen out with their daughter and grandson, Barron. The couple's exact path to citizenship isn't clear, but one likely possibility is that their daughter's citizenship helped them get green cards first, reports CNBC. As CNN notes, critics have pointed out that President Trump wants to end that type of family-based migration.",
    "generated_summary": "Viktor and Amalija Knavs are originally from Slovenia but have lived in the United States for over a decade. The Knavses obtained their citizenship through the sponsorship of their adult daughter, a source says. Trump has frequently railed against the family visa system, which permits U.S. citizens to sponsor their family members for visas. Experts say chain migration is the most likely way the Knaves gained their permanent residency in the US.\"It went well and they are very grateful and appreciative of this wonderful day for their family,\" said the couple's immigration lawyer, Michael Wildes, in a statement.",

Chelsea Manning shares first photo after prison Read more \n \n The 29-year-old was sentenced to 35 years in prison in 2013 after one of the most high-profile intelligence leaks in modern times. In 2007, while on leave from service in Iraq, Manning sent hundreds of thousands of classified and sensitive documents to WikiLeaks, including the video known as Collateral Murder that showed US military killing dozens of unarmed Iraqi citizens. \n \n Manning came out as transgender the day after she was sentenced. Lawyers successfully advocated for her to undergo hormone therapy while in prison. After six years behind bars, she was released from Fort Leavenworth prison on 17 May when, in one of his final acts as US president, Barack Obama commuted her sentence, saying \u201cjustice has been served.\u201d Manning has been living in New York since her release. \n \n Chelsea E. Manning (@xychelsea) guess this is what freedom looks like \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc59\ud83d\udc8b\ud83c\udfca\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udea3\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u26f4\ufe0f\ud83c\udf05\ud83c\udfd6\ufe0f\ud83c\udfd9\ufe0f @voguemagazine https://t.co/g7YYNkcd9l \ud83d\ude0e\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc95 https://t.co/nyAUje52bE pic.twitter.com/n4ixFkIdVn \n \n In an interview with Vogue\u2019s Nathan Heller, Manning spoke about her childhood in Oklahoma, her parents\u2019 separation, her growing awareness and confusion around her sexuality and gender identity, and her decision to enter the military in 2007 in the hope that it would help her \u201cfigure [herself] out\u201d. \n \n \n \n She told Heller she accepted responsibility for her whistleblowing actions: \u201cI think it\u2019s important to remember that when somebody sees government wrongdoing \u2013 whether it\u2019s illegal or immoral or unethical \u2013 there isn\u2019t the means available to do something about it ... Everyone keeps saying: \u2018You should have gone through the proper channels!\u2019 But the proper channels don\u2019t work.\u201d \n \n She also spoke about her time in prison, the psychological toll of which involved her making multiple suicide attempts and being shut away in solitary confinement. \n \n Since her release from prison, however, Manning\u2019s online persona has been a font of joy and positivity. In spite of relentless targeting by trolls and detractors, her tweets are frequently peppered with rainbows, hearts and smile emojis. \n \n Manning is not the first trans woman to feature in Vogue\u2019s pages, with models and trans women such as Hari Nef and Andreja Pejic having previously featuring in the fashion magazine. Earlier this year, French Vogue made headlines when Brazilian model Valentina Sampaio was revealed on the cover of their March issue \u2013 the first time the magazine had featured a transwoman on the cover. ||||| One hot, humid early-summer evening in New York, a hired car slows on Bleecker Street, and a young woman inside prepares for her first party out in years. She is wearing a midnight-colored semiformal dress by Altuzarra and Everlane ankle boots with heels. Her hair is trimmed into a pixie cut; her makeup softens, but won\u2019t hide, a dust of freckles. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll know anybody,\u201d she fretted earlier, but she seems to have quelled what nerves remain. She is accompanied by a couple of men who surround her like guards. For the first time in a long time, that\u2019s a welcome thing. \n \n Chelsea Manning\u2014graceful, blue-eyed, trans\u2014smiles and prepares herself. Since her release from the Fort Leavenworth prison, on May 17, Manning has been living in New York, with a low profile. Tonight she will make her social debut in her own skin. From February to April 2010, while living as Bradley, an Army intelligence analyst stationed in Iraq, Manning sent three-quarters of a million classified or sensitive documents to WikiLeaks. The breach\u2019s breadth was startling, as were its contents, ranging from the so-called Collateral Murder video, showing a U.S. helicopter killing a group of Baghdad pedestrians that included children and press, to hundreds of thousands of \u201cCablegate\u201d documents, disclosing 44 years of State Department messaging. When Manning\u2019s role became clear, she turned into a polarizing figure\u2014celebrated as a whistle-blower by some, condemned as a traitor by others. In August 2013, after pleading guilty to ten charges and being found guilty of 20, she was sentenced to 35 years in prison. The day after the sentencing, Manning came out publicly as trans. \n \n Tonight, a summer Monday, is a different kind of coming-out. To honor the occasion, she has picked an event with a celebratory turn: the after-party for the Lambda Literary Awards, which each year honor books by members of the LGBTQ community. The evening is glamorous; the guest list is varied. Here Manning will reintroduce herself to a community in which she seeks acceptance for more than her heavy past. \n \n The car stops in front of Le Poisson Rouge, a Washington Square art space. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how to do this,\u201d Chase Strangio, an ACLU lawyer, murmurs in the front seat. A gregarious young man with a trim Clark Gable mustache, Strangio has emerged as one of the nation\u2019s leading trans-rights lawyers, helping represent Gavin Grimm, the trans student in Virginia who challenged his exclusion from the boys\u2019 bathroom at his high school, and successfully advocating for Manning\u2019s hormone therapy in prison. With Manning now out in the world, however, he faces a new challenge: remaining alert to unwelcome attention. \n \n \u201cI think that looks pretty discreet,\u201d Tim Travers Hawkins, a filmmaker who\u2019s making a documentary on Manning, says, judging the entry. When his project, executive-produced by Laura Poitras, started two years back, he intended to use Manning\u2019s prison diaries to shape a documentary with an invisible hero. Then, in the final days of his term, President Obama commuted Manning\u2019s sentence. \u201cIt was kind of unbelievable,\u201d Poitras says. \u201cAll the news had been so, so bad.\u201d For Hawkins, Manning\u2019s release introduced new imperatives. \u201cIt was a radical shift in the way the film existed,\u201d Hawkins says. Tonight, he\u2019s brought a compact camera along. \n \n Manning, Strangio, and Hawkins clamber rapidly inside. A Lambda host guides Manning down a flight of steps. The party is just starting. At one end of the space, a platform, slightly raised above the dance floor, is marked off with velvet rope. A plate of crudit\u00e9s awaits; Manning orders a gimlet. She\u2019s extroverted, she says: \u201cI love being around people.\u201d While living as a man, she often went to clubs and parties, even in stodgy Washington, D.C. \u201cPeople are a lot more open and outgoing in New York,\u201d Manning explains. \u201cIn D.C., you really had to, like, know someone.\u201d \n \n Music pounds through the room, which is dim and bathed in blue and fuchsia light. As the space fills, a few brave souls approach Manning, then a few more. Soon the platform is packed with people hoping to take a flash-bleached selfie. \n \n \u201cI just wanted to say hello. You\u2019re, like, a perfect hero.\u201d \n \n \u201cI\u2019m going to give you this card. We\u2019d love to throw a party for your return.\u201d \n \n Manning seems startled by the attention. \u201cThank you!\u201d she keeps saying. She is 29 now, with a confidence that, even in a novel city, hits like sunlight at high altitude. Though she\u2019s petite\u2014just a few inches over five feet\u2014she speaks with a clarion directness, as if constantly projecting toward an unseen back row. In prison, she read the fashion press (\u201cI missed seven years of fashion, but I went through every season in a magazine!\u201d), and while she\u2019s embraced her femininity, she eschews what she calls \u201cfertility style\u201d\u2014\u201cbunnies and hearts and stuff\u201d\u2014for more current, gender-neutral garments. While serving out her sentence, she got her hands on photos from Barneys\u2019 2014 trans campaign, shot by Bruce Weber. \u201cThat was a really important thing for me to see,\u201d she says. \n \n From the stage, the DJ mixes sharpen: \u201cUptown Funk,\u201d \u201cI Feel It Coming.\u201d But there isn\u2019t time to dance. She\u2019s standing, greeting new faces from all sides, thanking, thanking some more. Her left arm is crossed over her belly, cradling her opposite elbow, which is straight. When Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cLove on Top\u201d begins its climbing modulations, she uncrosses her arms and begins fidgeting\u2014mindlessly, flirtatiously\u2014with the charm on her gold necklace, drawing it back and forth between her thumb and forefinger. She sways. She lets herself lean forward, laughing at a joke. When her newest friend wanders away, she turns around and smiles. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m starting to loosen up!\u201d she says. \n \n When Manning was growing up in Crescent, a town of some 1,400 north of Oklahoma City, she struggled to pinpoint a reason she felt so awkward. \u201cI knew that I was different,\u201d she says. \u201cI gravitated more toward playing house, but the teachers were always pushing me toward playing the more competitive games with the boys.\u201d She recalls, \u201cI spent so much time wondering, What\u2019s wrong with me? Why can\u2019t I fit in?\u201d Sometimes she felt left behind; at other times, she leaped out in front. Once, she and a group of other kids were allowed to take a field trip to Frontier City, an amusement park known for its loopy, soaring Silver Bullet roller coaster. Other students were petrified. Manning couldn\u2019t wait to get on and boarded the ride all alone: \u201cI\u2019m a bit of an adrenaline junkie, I think it\u2019s safe to say.\u201d \n \n It\u2019s a June afternoon, and we are sitting in a park along the Hudson River, a short walk from the sleek Tribeca building where Manning has been living since arriving in New York. Today she is dressed with a mixture of straightforward elegance and function: a casual black sleeveless Marc Jacobs dress with playful paisley lining, a small purse from The Row, Borderline boots by Vetements x Dr. Martens, and\u2014the cinching touch\u2014a black utility belt from 5.11 Tactical, a gear company that supplies law enforcement and the military. \u201cI\u2019ve been a huge fan of Marc Jacobs for many, many years, even going back to when I was wearing men\u2019s clothing,\u201d she explains. \u201cHe captures a kind of simplicity and a kind of beauty that I like\u2014projecting strength through femininity.\u201d \n \n In Manning\u2019s telling, strength was a necessity before it was a choice. When she was eleven, her father, a computer engineer who\u2019d gotten his start in the Navy, announced that he was moving out, effectively ending his marriage. That night, her mother swallowed a bottle of pills, then told Chelsea\u2019s older sister, Casey, what she\u2019d done. On the hurried drive to emergency room, the journalist Denver Nicks reports in Private, his book on Manning\u2019s early life, it was Chelsea\u2019s job to sit with her mother in the backseat and make sure that she did not stop breathing. \n \n Over the months that followed, Casey and Chelsea, then still known as Bradley, struggled to manage their mother\u2019s alcoholism while also learning to navigate basic domestic chores. Nicks reports that their mother, who\u2019d grown up in Wales and married early, didn\u2019t know how to write a check, let alone pay bills or seek alimony. \u201cI had to learn how to do all of this stuff with my mother and also deal with the friction between my parents,\u201d says Manning. \u201cI loved them both, but they were angry at each other. I always felt like I was doing something wrong and I had caused it.\u201d (Manning\u2019s family members have declined interviews since her release.) \n \n From twelve to thirteen, Manning grew up quickly. She realized that she was attracted to boys, and considered herself gay. Her father had introduced Manning to computers and programming at a young age, and Manning began to see the Internet\u2014vast, anonymous, and full of answers\u2014as an escape. \u201cI learned that I wasn\u2019t alone. I learned about all these different life possibilities and options,\u201d she explains. She began to find her first natural identity. \u201cBecause I would actually be anonymous online, I could be more myself.\u201d \n \n The Web also held constant through a series of displacements. In November 2001, when Manning was just shy of fourteen, her mother decided to return to Wales and took Manning with her. (Casey had moved away; their father had remarried.) Her responsibilities increased as her mother\u2019s health declined. In 2005, after a fluky brush with the July 7 London bombings\u2014Manning says she was near King\u2019s Cross station at the moment of the Tube explosions\u2014she moved in with her father, his wife, and his stepson. That arrangement didn\u2019t end well: Mounting tension ended with Manning allegedly brandishing a knife and her stepmother calling 911. Manning lived for a spell with a friend in Tulsa, then drifted to Chicago. In increasingly dire straits, she was taken in by her aunt Debbie, in suburban Maryland. She worked at Starbucks and Abercrombie & Fitch; she explored the LGBTQ scene of greater D.C.; she enrolled, briefly, in community college. At nineteen, she started seeing a psychologist for the first time. \n \n \u201cThat\u2019s the part of my life I replay the most: whether or not, living in Maryland and seeing a therapist, I could have finally been able to say, \u2018This is who I am; this is what I want to do.\u2019 It was the first time in my life when I really considered transitioning. But I got scared,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI really regret the fact that I didn\u2019t know or realize I already had the love I needed, especially from my aunt and sister\u2014just to seek support.\u201d \n \n Rather, she made a defiantly different choice. It was the moment of the so-called surge in Iraq. The news on TV was grim. \u201cI don\u2019t know who I am,\u201d she recalls in the park. \u201cMaybe the military will allow me to figure that out.\u201d She looks out toward the river. \u201cIt was a naive thought, but it was very real to me in 2007.\u201d \n \n On the grass behind us, teenage girls are putting together a dance routine: \u201cFive, six, seven, eight!\u201d Not far away, upriver, are the piers where, for years, LGBTQ teens have congregated at the witching hour to vogue under the stars. If Manning had remained in Maryland and been a little braver, she now believes, her 20s could have been quite different. \n \n Instead, she traveled as a new Army enlistee to Fort Leonard Wood, in Missouri; trained as an intelligence analyst at Fort Huachuca, in Arizona; and worked for about a year at Fort Drum, in New York, as an analyst with a top-secret clearance. In October 2009, she was shipped to a base outside Baghdad, where she became Specialist Manning: an anguished 22-year-old in a harsh environment, with access to some of the military\u2019s darkest secrets. \n \n The clock has barely struck midnight at Le Poisson Rouge when Manning\u2019s first night at the ball seems to end. The music stops; fluorescent lights flicker on overhead. There will be a small after-after-party\u2014a loose, laid-back affair\u2014at Julius, a tavern in the Village that is sometimes called the oldest extant gay bar in New York. Strangio has peeled off\u2014he has a family to return to\u2014but Manning decides to continue: The world is new again, and she\u2019s not ready to go home. \n \n About a dozen people walk the half-mile to the tavern. It is 12:45 a.m. and quiet on the streets; sprinklers stutter softly over the Minetta Green. Manning has no I.D. yet, for arcane reasons\u2014she lost her old one with her old life\u2014but the doorman at Julius is expecting her. For weeks after coming to New York, she wandered all around the city, unrecognized. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m living in fear or anything,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI\u2019m so glad to be out and about and walking around.\u201d \n \n Julius\u2019s interior creaks with landmark artifacts: black-and-white photos checkering the walls, posters commemorating the gay-rights Mattachine Society\u2019s 1966 \u201csip-in\u201d at the bar. Manning alights on a bench underneath an American flag whose stripes are replaced with the bars of the pride banner. Conversation foams around her while the jukebox plays. They are deep into drinks; people are sitting on laps. Manning falls into conversation with January Hunt, a writer, musician, and artist who is also a young trans woman. Manning is describing her trip into Brooklyn for a tech \u201cmeet-up\u201d in a derelict building; it struck her, she explains, as \u201cvery New York.\u201d \n \n Manning publicly came out in a written statement, sent to and read aloud on the Today show, in which she asked to be called by female pronouns and expressed interest in hormone therapy. She had thought of making an announcement earlier, she says\u2014she had taken her first outing in women\u2019s dress in February 2010 and had told guards at the detention center where she was first imprisoned that she was a woman\u2014but had been advised that it would complicate the trial. \u201cThe opportunity to do it on the Today show popped up, so it happened a little bit sooner and a little faster than I hoped it would,\u201d she told me. Still, she says, she was taken aback by the response. \u201cI was honestly a bit surprised by the outpouring of love and support that I got,\u201d she says. If there was backlash, too (and there was), she doesn\u2019t seem to have registered it\u2014a tellingly upbeat response from a woman who now sprinkles her tweets with hearts and rainbows. \n \n Prison bureaucracy was another story. Almost immediately after coming to the ACLU in 2013, Strangio\u2014a trans man himself\u2014began work on Manning\u2019s civil case, fighting for her to begin receiving hormone therapy. \u201cOur goal was to get her the health care that she needed,\u201d he explained. \u201cEven when there are legal principles that are pretty unambiguously on our side, there\u2019s so much cultural bias we\u2019re confronting in the courts and in other systems.\u201d Meanwhile, behind bars, Manning sought equilibrium in other ways. \u201cThe first thing I learned to do was avoid television,\u201d she says. She took out subscriptions to \u201c50 or 60\u201d periodicals, she says\u2014news and global-affairs publications, science magazines, technical journals, and, of course, fashion glossies. She describes it to me as \u201clike having a printed version of the Internet.\u201d And she read books: literary classics, fantasy series, contemporary histories. She liked biographies: Queen Isabella, Joan of Arc. She read Cheryl Strayed\u2019s memoir, Wild, three times. Many of Manning\u2019s favorites seemed to emphasize personal strength or bureaucratic disaffection. She read Catch-22, she says, more than once. \u201cI was institutionalized to such a point where my expectations were limited to, I\u2019m going to eat the next meal. I\u2019m going to go to sleep. I\u2019m going to be here the next day,\u201d Manning says. Before commutation, this outlook had psychological costs; as recently as last October, she tried to kill herself for the second time. Then, in January 2017, the White House phoned the office of one of her lawyers. \n \n In his statement announcing the commutation, President Obama emphasized that it was not a pardon for her crime. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: Chelsea Manning has served a tough prison sentence,\u201d he said in a press conference. \u201cI feel very comfortable that justice has been served.\u201d \n \n On the day of Manning\u2019s release, things happened quickly. She picked her first outfit for life as a woman: a black-and-white striped blouse, with matching sneakers. She stopped at a roadside pizza joint, got a pepperoni slice, and posted a photo of it to Instagram. (\u201cFreest pizza ever!\u201d she tells me.) She had the lawyers who picked her up drive her to the countryside. \u201cI think I spent, like, five or six hours sitting outside.\u201d \n \n A day after leaving Fort Leavenworth, she posted a new photo (\u201cOK, so here I am everyone!!\u201d) with the coder-inspired hashtag #HelloWorld. She had on a trim black dress by one of her favorite designers, Gabriela Hearst. Her hair was crisply coiffed; she wore a vibrant lip. In a Guardian column, written while in prison, Manning had discussed her nervousness about moving through the world as a woman. Now that she\u2019s no longer worried about being \u201cfound out\u201d by the military, she says, the fear is gone. \u201cIt feels natural. It feels like it\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be, instead of this anxiety, this uncertainty, this ball of self-consciousness that comes with pretending to be male,\u201d she says. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel right. I didn\u2019t know what it was. I couldn\u2019t describe it. Now that\u2019s gone.\u201d \n \n Poitras, who met Manning for the first time after her release, says she was startled by the young woman\u2019s focus. \u201cThere are people who have really put their lives on the line for something, and they come out on the other side of it. You can feel that with her,\u201d Poitras tells me. \u201cNow that she\u2019s free, what is she going to do with her freedom?\u201d She adds, \u201cWhen I first met Ed Snowden in Hong Kong, he had the same sort of eerie power.\u201d \n \n Twice during our conversations, and in slightly different ways, I ask Manning what she regrets from the period when she was living as Specialist Bradley Manning. Her leaking of state secrets doesn\u2019t appear on the list, although that decision remains the most publicly controversial of her life, earning her accusations of treason and reckless endangerment. \u201cI\u2019ve accepted responsibility for my own decisions and my own actions,\u201d she says. When we speak, Reality Winner, the 25-year-old intelligence contractor, has recently been arrested on suspicion of leaking information about Russian hacking in the 2016 U.S. election, adding to a list of leakers who, like Snowden, have become household names. Manning tells me that she has nothing to say about Winner (\u201cAll I know is what I see in the media reports\u201d) but speaks about what she refers to as \u201cthe larger issue.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s important to remember that when somebody sees government wrongdoing\u2014whether it\u2019s illegal or immoral or unethical\u2014there isn\u2019t the means available to do something about it,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone keeps saying, You should have gone through the proper channels! But the proper channels don\u2019t work.\u201d \n \n Manning describes trying to release information to the press before WikiLeaks. \u201cIn 2010, I was literally scrambling around D.C. trying to get The Washington Post to publish this stuff, and then I went to The New York Times.\u201d Manning has said that a reporter at the Post with whom she spoke briefly over the phone wouldn\u2019t commit to a story, which she took as a sign of uninterest. At the Times, she says, she left a message on the voice mail of the ombudsman, confusingly called the Public Editor. The editor and his assistant later said that they had no memory of such a message, but explained that they received hundreds a week. \u201cI did this all on leave,\u201d Manning says. \u201cI had only twelve days.\u201d The approaching \u201cSnowmageddon\u201d made it harder still. Manning traveled from public phone to public phone, to avoid a traceable line. \u201cI ran out of time,\u201d she says. Before returning to Iraq, she sent files to WikiLeaks. \n \n Even so, Manning continues to take her struggle to find an outlet as proof of a systemic problem. \u201cWe need to have more ways to talk about what\u2019s going on in government,\u201d she says. I ask what those ways might look like. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s right,\u201d she says. \u201cI have certain values. I live by those.\u201d \n \n When it comes to information freedom, those values remain controversial. Many lawmakers bridled at her abbreviated sentence; at the time of the commutation, Paul Ryan said, \u201cChelsea Manning\u2019s treachery put American lives at risk and exposed some of our nation\u2019s most sensitive secrets.\u201d Others argue that her motives, like a public-interest journalist\u2019s, were honorable\u2014or that the actual damage of the leaks was small. Beyond some vocal LGBTQ advocacy (she was a star of the summer\u2019s Pride March in New York, waving from a drop-top Nissan alongside Gavin Grimm), Manning herself has mostly stayed circumspect on issues of politics. Still, in a Guardian column from January 25, a few days following her commutation, she offered a soft criticism of President Obama\u2019s tactical approach: \u201cThe one simple lesson to draw from President Obama\u2019s legacy: Do not start off with a compromise. They won\u2019t meet you in the middle.\u201d President Trump, newly elected, lambasted Manning over Twitter: \u201cUngrateful TRAITOR Chelsea Manning, who should never have been released from prison, is now calling President Obama a weak leader. Terrible!\u201d \n \n Manning has avoided a rejoinder to the president\u2019s tweet. And to the extent that WikiLeaks of 2017 (which seems to have pursued specific electoral outcomes in France and America and is dogged by the troubled reputation of its leader, Julian Assange) has a different public reputation than the 2010 organization (which claimed more categorical anti-secrecy principles), she has avoided opinions there, too. \u201cI\u2019ve been in prison for seven years! I\u2019ve been completely disconnected from all of that,\u201d she tells me. Her plan is to live in New York until late summer, then move to suburban Maryland, not far from where she was before. \n \n By then, she hopes to be acclimated to a new life. For the moment, certain habits of this decade strike her as weird. Our phone fixation, for example. \u201cWe\u2019re sitting in the same room as each other but looking at our phones constantly,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore I was in prison, I was one of the only people on social media. I was a novelty. Now everybody\u2019s on social media all the time!\u201d It\u2019s too much. \u201cI think that\u2019s where a lot of this miscommunication, polarization, friction, and chaos is coming from.\u201d \n \n Thus, though she tweets and Instagrams, Manning has tried to focus on more in-the-moment pursuits. She still loves video games, though she has forsworn the violent ones. Soon after leaving prison, she began teaching herself the programming language Rust. (\u201cIt has a lot of features that weren\u2019t available seven years ago,\u201d she says.) She hopes to begin dating\u2014\u201cI\u2019m not planning to be single!\u201d\u2014but intends to wait until her life settles, in Maryland. \n \n She is also at work on a memoir. \u201cI\u2019m trying to tell the story as if it was happening now and you\u2019re with me,\u201d she explains. Hawkins, the documentarian, says he plans to stop shooting soon, as Manning\u2019s personal narrative finds its own way in the world: \u201cShe\u2019s too young for this film to attempt to be the definitive story of her life.\u201d \n \n Manning does not know what her career will be. While living as Bradley Manning, she expressed an interest in running for political office. I ask whether that\u2019s still on her mind. \u201cI\u2019m certainly not going to say no, and I\u2019m certainly not going to say yes,\u201d she says. \u201cMy goal is to use these next six months to figure out where I want to go. \n \n \u201cI have these values that I can connect with: responsibility, compassion,\u201d she goes on. \u201cThose are really foundational for me. Do and say and be who you are because, no matter what happens, you are loved unconditionally.\u201d It\u2019s the lesson, she says, that she wishes she learned earlier. \u201cUnconditional love,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is OK to be who I am.\u201d \n \n In front of an apartment building in the East Seventies, near Central Park, Manning meets up with Strangio to pay a visit to a hero of New York\u2019s LGBTQ past. It\u2019s 90 degrees, clear, and sticky. Manning arrives late, looking addled and a little faint. She had a subway snafu, she explains, and then a long walk. Strangio takes her shoulders and gives them a shake. \u201cOh, my God\u2014hi!\u201d he says with get-ahold-of-yourself astringency. Inside, they board a tiny elevator that seems as old as the building. \n \n \u201cEverybody in!\u201d Strangio says merrily as it begins groaning upward. \u201cWe\u2019ll just get stuck in here a few days.\u201d \n \n \u201cI\u2019ve got a flashlight,\u201d Manning deadpans. \n \n At a time when drag queens were widely shunned, Jack Doroshow, better known as Flawless Sabrina, blazed a trail across Philadelphia and New York with her high-profile drag pageants, forcing the cities to acknowledge and accept their androgyne and transgender communities. Bobby Kennedy helped her book a venue. Andy Warhol helped secure funding for a film on the pageants, The Queen (1968), which went to Cannes. Flawless posed for Diane Arbus, acted for John Waters, and dated William S. Burroughs. Along the way, she was arrested several times and came to be known as a \u201cmother\u201d figure in the queer community. Now in her late 70s, she suffers from various age-related ailments. There are good days and bad days, but today is good. \n \n The long wall of Flawless\u2019s sitting room is mirrored, floor to ceiling. A desk near the window supports pineapple-esque lamps and on the far wall is a framed canvas that looks like\u2014is assumed to be\u2014a late-period Picasso. Scattered through the room are heads: mannequin heads, papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 heads, other heads, one sporting a costume-ball mask and feather headpiece, another wearing a wig and sunglasses, a third stabbed at the scalp with hypodermic syringes. \n \n Just then, Flawless enters the room. \u201cGorgeous!\u201d she says, looking at Manning. \u201cGirl, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d \n \n She is sitting in a wheelchair pushed by Curtis Carman, an artist who is Flawless\u2019s partner. She looks old, alert, and not unlike Picasso herself: bald, with a striped shirt and a big, knitted navy cardigan. Carman helps her climb into a thronelike chair behind the desk. \u201cNow, how\u2019s your family?\u201d she asks Manning. \n \n \u201cThey\u2019re all right,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re laying low a little bit.\u201d She hasn\u2019t seen her mother yet, Manning explains. She lives in the care of her family and cannot travel. \n \n \u201cBut you\u2019ll do that,\u201d Flawless says. It\u2019s not a question. \u201cYou\u2019re young, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \n \n \u201cTwenty-nine. I hope that\u2019s young.\u201d \n \n \u201cYou bet.\u201d Flawless allows herself a smile. \u201cI mean, as I look at it, everybody\u2019s pretty new.\u201d \n \n Flawless brings her palms together. \u201cAll I see is a very natural, very beautiful little girl,\u201d she says. \u201cThe only jarring thing is that there\u2019s so much power. This is somebody who has changed history.\u201d \n \n Manning thanks her and keeps talking\u2014about her move to Maryland, and then about her writing. Flawless starts shaking her head. \u201cI can\u2019t get over how beautiful you are,\u201d she says. \n \n Through the next half-hour, they discuss the military, the Tonys, the past. Before Manning leaves, Flawless is keen to pass on some wisdom. \u201cThink about your story,\u201d she says. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m not done yet!\u201d Manning protests. \n \n \u201cNo,\u201d Flawless says slowly. \n \n Strangio says they should let Flawless rest. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to change the world,\u201d Flawless chirps. She draws Strangio close. \u201cI am so proud of you,\u201d she says, and gives him a tight hug. \n \n Manning comes next. Flawless wraps her aged arms around her small frame. \u201cThank you so much,\u201d she whispers, so softly that Manning may not hear. \u201cThank you so much.\u201d When Manning stands, she moves briskly toward the door. Flawless\u2019s eyes are wet with tears. \n \n In this story: Fashion Editor: Phyllis Posnick. Hair: Jimmy Paul for Bumble and Bumble; Makeup: Alice Lane.

She came out as transgender one day after the sentencing, and publicly came out to NBC's \"Today.\" \n \n \"I was honestly a bit surprised by the outpouring of love and support that I got,\" she told Vogue. \n \n Manning has become somewhat of a social-media celebrity since being released from prison. She told the magazine that she is not sure about her future career plans, but she said she is at work on a memoir. \n \n The photos and accompanying article, unsurprisingly, lit up social media. Some praised Manning's photo shoot (\"simply lovely\" and \"brave\"), but others criticized the magazine for both featuring a trans woman and for featuring a person who was controversially released from prison early. \n \n This @voguemagazine profile of Chelsea Manning is simply lovely https://t.co/pwbtBHd156 \u2014 Emma Gray (@emmaladyrose) August 10, 2017 \n \n Chelsea Manning Is A Hero, And We Don't Deserve Her \u2014 Avery Edison (@aedison) August 10, 2017 \n \n VILE: Vogue Magazine To Feature Transgender Traitor Chelsea Manning https://t.co/e8Upe29Ris #tcot \u2014 super czar (@Kristokoff) August 10, 2017 \n \n While the September issue of Vogue is traditionally one of the most ad-packed and profitable issues of the magazine, this year's issue was already creating controversy online the same day it was published. The cover featured Jennifer Lawrence by the Statue of Liberty, which some conservative activists took as a criticism of President Trump. In response, one of the editors tweeted that it was shot in June. ||||| If Bradley Manning had stayed Bradley Manning, would he still be in prison? If Bradley Manning had stayed Bradley Manning, would he be basking in celebrity, enjoying fawning photo shoots? Given the magnitude of his crimes, I dare say that he\u2019d be in prison today if he still identified as a man. Then he\u2019d be nothing but what he actually is, a garden-variety traitor \u2014 a faithless soldier who should count himself fortunate not to face capital punishment. \n \n It\u2019s worth remembering what he did. He disclosed, in a gigantic document dump, more than a million pages of classified information, including information about American military operations, American diplomacy, and American allies. The Obama administration was forced to rush to safety foreign friends whom Manning had outed as helping Americans. He broke faith with every relevant provision of the Army\u2019s warrior ethos \u2014 he abandoned his mission, he actively aided the enemy, and he acted with stunning disregard for the lives of his comrades. He did so because, acting on his own authority, he decided he wanted to stimulate \u201cworldwide discussion, debate, and reforms.\u201d \n \n To be clear, this wasn\u2019t whistleblowing. He didn\u2019t identify a specific wrong and expose it responsibly while taking care to minimize the harm of disclosure. He just disclosed documents without regard for their contents. He didn\u2019t know if anyone would die because of his actions. He didn\u2019t know to what extent vital missions or programs would be compromised. He just did what he wanted to do. There was no honor in his action. None. \n \n And now look at him. He\u2019s the subject of a fawning Vogue profile and photo shoot: \n \n Chelsea Manning will be featured in Vogue magazine\u2019s September issue https://t.co/zARmVhCca5 pic.twitter.com/SMRR2EAhLT \u2014 CNN (@CNN) August 10, 2017 \n \n In fact, he\u2019s an LGBT celebrity now, swarmed at public events and even featured at New York\u2019s Pride March, where he waved \u201cfrom a drop-top Nissan alongside Gavin Grimm.\u201d When Trump issued a series of tweets declaring a ban on transgender soldiers in the military, media outlets flocked to cover Manning\u2019s response. But one wonders, do the transgender soldiers actually serving look at Chelsea Manning as a poster child for trans service? \n \n But no matter. For many leftists, Manning offers the irresistible combination \u2014 radical criminal acts combined with revolutionary identity. It\u2019s \u201cRadical Chic\u201d all over again, this time through the lens of latest civil-rights fashion, transgender rights \n \n The radical quarters of the Left have a long history of excusing and celebrating even the most vile of criminals so long as they have the right revolutionary politics. Disturbingly, that celebration leaks even into organizations that are billed as \u201cmeanstream.\u201d Recall, it was just last month the Women\u2019s March tweeted its appreciation for convicted cop-killer and FBI most-wanted terrorist Assata Shakur: \n \n Earlier this summer, New York\u2019s Puerto Rican Day Parade sought to honor convicted terrorist Oscar Lopez Rivera as a \u201cNational Freedom Hero.\u201d Under pressure, he decided to \u201cforgo\u201d that honor, but he was featured in a float anyway \u2014 and parts of the crowd gave him a \u201chero\u2019s welcome.\u201d \n \n This is what radical identity politics does. \n \n These kinds of celebrations are not just morally abhorrent; they\u2019re deeply polarizing. They represent the idea that the rule of law \u2014 even when the subject is murder or treason \u2014 is contingent upon the politics and racial or gender identity of the lawbreaker. Americans on opposing sides of the ideological divide are given a signal \u2014 that when it comes to advancing the radical cause, not even human life or national security can stand in the way. There are no lines that can\u2019t be crossed. \n \n This is what radical identity politics does. It twists and distorts normal moral analysis. It declares that the ends justify the means, and then goes even farther to say, \u201cBy any means necessary.\u201d This is an unacceptable ethic not just for a constitutional republic but for any form of civil society. Allegedly \u201cmainstream\u201d media outlets, politicians, or organizations that honor or respect the likes of Manning, Rivera, or Shakur cover themselves in shame. \n \n READ MORE: \n \n NR Editorial: The Injustice of Commuting Manning\u2019s Sentence \n \n Chelsea Manning Is Not a Whistleblower \n \n Chelsea Manning and the Problem with Pronouns \n \n \u2014 David French is a senior writer for National Review, a senior fellow at the National Review Institute, and an attorney.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 If you've ever wanted to know the effect that liberation has on a person, Chelsea Manning is glad to show you. ABC News reports that the transgender soldier released from prison earlier this year posted a photo Thursday to her social media accounts that shows her smiling at the beach in a red one-piece swimsuit, with the caption, \"Guess this is what freedom looks like.\" The picture was taken by celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz, who documented Manning for an article appearing in the September issue of Vogue. In that interview, Manning talks about how she's adjusting to being out of jail, her regrets that she didn't come out as transgender earlier in her life, and her future plans, which may or may not include running for political office. \"My goal is to use these next six months to figure out where I want to go,\" she notes. Online reaction to the Vogue coverage has been mixed, CBS News notes, with some offering support and others blasting the magazine for highlighting both a transgender woman and someone who many believe should still be behind bars. \"This ugly whatever should be in prison, forever,\" one non-fan tweeted, to which Manning replied, \"And here I am,\" accompanied by her trademark slew of positive emojis. The conservative National Review also weighed in, with a column by David French that asks: \"If Bradley Manning had stayed Bradley Manning, would he be basking in celebrity, enjoying fawning photo shoots?\" The Guardian notes that Manning's appearance in Vogue isn't the magazine's first transgender presence: Models Hari Nef and Andreja Pejic have both appeared in its pages, and model Valentina Sampaio has graced the cover of the publication's French version.",

In addition to her nominations for \u201cSilkwood\u201d and \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally,\u201d the nomination she shared with Jeff Arch and David S. Ward was for \u201cSleepless in Seattle\u201d (1993), not \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Mail\u201d (1998). She wrote the latter screenplay with her sister \u00adDelia Ephron, not with Arch and Ward. This version has been corrected. \n \n \u201cTake notes,\u201d Nora Ephron\u2019s mother advised her as a child. \u201cEverything is copy.\u201d \n \n Her mother, a Broadway playwright and Hollywood screenwriter, imbued Ms. Ephron with a razor-sharp self-awareness and the ambition to transform workaday absurdities, cultural idiosyncrasies, romantic foibles and even marital calamity into essays, novels and films brimming with invitingly mordant wit. She credited her mother with bestowing \u201cthis kind of terrific ability, not to avoid pain but to turn it over and recycle it as soon as possible.\u201d \n \n Nora Ephron, who gained a devoted following for her perceptive, deeply personal essays and parlayed that renown into a screenwriting career of wistful romantic comedies such as \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Mail,\u201d the marital expos\u00e9\u201cHeartburn\u201d and the whistleblower drama \u201cSilkwood,\u201d died June 26 at a hospital in New York. She was 71. \n \n The death was confirmed by her friend Richard Cohen, a Washington Post columnist. She died of complications from the blood disorder myelodysplasia, which was diagnosed six years ago. \n \n As a young woman, Ms. Ephron modeled her self-deprecating and deadpan writing style on Dorothy Parker, part of the Algonquin Round Table of sophisticated New York writers and humorists that also included Robert Benchley and S.J. Perelman. Of the philandering husband in her 1983 novel \u201cHeartburn\u201d \u2014 modeled on her marriage to former Washington Post journalist Carl Bernstein \u2014 Ms. Ephron wrote he was \u201ccapable of having sex with a Venetian blind.\u201d \n \n In time, Ms. Ephron became a social confederate of New York playwrights, filmmakers and wits, including Mike Nichols, Woody Allen and Calvin Trillin; Washington journalists including former Post executive editor Benjamin Bradlee and his journalist wife, Sally Quinn; and a Hollywood coterie that included Rob Reiner, Tom Hanks, Steve Martin and Steven Spielberg. \n \n As a woman in the male-dominated movie business, Ms. Ephron was a rare \u201ctriple-hyphenate\u201d as writer, director and producer. But making movies for and about women was a battle, at times. She observed how, to male studio moguls, \u201ca movie about a woman\u2019s cure for cancer is less interesting than a movie about a man with a hangnail.\u201d \n \n From her early years as a journalist for Esquire and New York magazines, Ms. Ephron was regarded as a keen cultural barometer. She repeatedly channeled her interest in the zeitgeist to the screen. Her last film, \u201cJulie & Julia\u201d (2009), starring Meryl Streep as the French-cooking apostle Julia Child and Amy Adams as a modern disciple, explored the trendy fascination with blogging and gourmet cooking. \n \n In \u201cSilkwood\u201d (1983), a biographical drama directed by Nichols and starring Streep as a plutonium plant employee and union activist, Ms. Ephron tapped into the era\u2019s fear of nuclear meltdowns and corporate coverups. Her novel and 1986 screenplay for \u201cHeartburn\u201d \u2014 which starred Streep and Jack Nicholson \u2014 reflected what countless other women were experiencing through their disappointing marriages and efforts to balance career ambitions with homemaking obligations. \n \n The tension between the sexes also played a central role in her sparkling screenplay for \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d (1989), which Reiner directed and which starred Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan as yuppies who forgo sex with each other for decades to maintain their friendship. As a writer and director, Ms. Ephron was among the first to chronicle the addictive thrill of romance by e-mail in \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Mail\u201d (1998), starring Hanks and Ryan. \n \n Ms. Ephron received three Oscar nominations for her writing, for \u201cSilkwood\u201d (shared with Alice Arlen), \u201cSleepless in Seattle\u201d (with David S. Ward and Jeff Arch) and \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally.\u201d \n \n The most unforgettable \u2014 and oft-quoted \u2014 scene from \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d showed Ryan faking a loud orgasm in front of Crystal over lunch at a delicatessen. After Ryan\u2019s intense moment, a woman at a nearby booth tells the waiter, \u201cI\u2019ll have what she\u2019s having.\u201d \n \n Ms. Ephron said it was Ryan\u2019s idea to film the scene in the deli, and it was Crystal who came up with the one-liner. But the core idea came from talks between Ms. Ephron and Reiner. \n \n \u201cOne day, we were sitting around and Rob said to me, \u2018You know, we\u2019ve told you all this stuff that you didn\u2019t know about men, now you tell us something we don\u2019t know about women,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Ephron told an audience at a book reading in 2006. \u201cIt was almost like, \u2018I dare you.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Well, women fake orgasms.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Not with me.\u2019 \u201d \n \n \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Yes, we do,\u2019 \u201d she added. \u201cMaybe not all the time, but sometimes. He still didn\u2019t believe me. So we went thundering into the bullpen at Castle Rock Pictures where all the women work, and he asked them, \u2018Is it true that women fake orgasms?\u2019 And all these women nodded yes. What a shock that scene was for men.\u201d \n \n \u201cThat\u2019s my career, right there,\u201d Ms. Ephron quipped. \n \n Nora Louise Ephron was born May 19, 1941, in Manhattan and raised in Beverly Hills, Calif., where she once joked of \u201cloving the smell of mink, the smell of the pavement after it rained and the smell of dollar bills.\u201d \n \n Her parents were prosperous but heavy-drinking Broadway playwrights, Henry Ephron and the former Phoebe Wolkind, and Nora was the first of their four daughters. The younger Ephron siblings, Amy, Delia and Hallie, also became writers. \n \n From their earliest years, the Ephron children were trained to come to the dinner table prepared to tell stories. Nora Ephron said that many of the tales \u2014 how a younger sister got her head caught in the banister and the fire department came to the rescue \u2014 became plot devices in their parents\u2019 films. Years later, Nora Ephron\u2019s letters home from Wellesley College were the source of her parents\u2019 Broadway comedy \u201cTake Her, She\u2019s Mine\u201d (1961), which became a film starring James Stewart and Sandra Dee. \n \n After graduating in 1962 from Wellesley, Ms. Ephron spent five years as a general assignment reporter at the New York Post before leaving daily journalism in 1968 to freelance for large-circulation magazines such as Good Housekeeping. Many of the pieces, on cultural trends, were published in her first book-length collection, \u201cWallflower at the Orgy\u201d (1970). \n \n As the women\u2019s movement gained traction in the decade that followed, Ms. Ephron was often invited to discuss it on television and in articles for Esquire and New York magazines. She brought a strikingly light-hearted touch to her deeply felt belief in women\u2019s rights. \n \n \u201cI have always thought it was a terrible shame that the women\u2019s movement didn\u2019t realize how much easier it was to reach people by making them laugh than by shaking a fist and saying don\u2019t you see how oppressed you are,\u201d she told Newsday in 1976. \n \n Her 1975 collection \u201cCrazy Salad: Some Things about Women\u201d included essays on vaginal deodorants, a Pillsbury bake-off, her Wellesley reunion and, one of her most reprinted articles, \u201cA Few Words About Breasts.\u201d She reminisced about how her flat chest made her feel like an outlier in a world that fetishized large breasts. But the trauma began at home. \n \n \u201cMy mother was really hateful about bras,\u201d she wrote, \u201cand by the time my third sister had gotten to the point where she was ready to want one, my mother had worked the whole business into a comedy routine. \u2018Why not use a Band-Aid instead?\u2019 she would say.\u201d \n \n Her next collection, \u201cScribble, Scribble: Notes on the Media\u201d (1978), was based on her tenure as a media columnist for Esquire in the mid-1970s. At the time, she was married to Bernstein, whose collaboration at The Post with Bob Woodward helped uncover the Watergate scandal that led to President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s resignation. \n \n Her first marriage, to Dan Greenburg, author of books including \u201cHow to Be a Jewish Mother,\u201d ended in divorce. She had married Bernstein in 1976 and was seven months pregnant with her second child when she discovered her husband was having an affair with Margaret Jay, the wife of the British ambassador. She delivered the child prematurely, and the marriage smashed apart in an ugly and public way, garnering coverage in People magazine and other publications. \n \n Ms. Ephron later said that it was impossible to resist writing about her marriage, telling The Post that \u201calthough it was the most awful thing I\u2019ve ever been through . . . it was by far the most interesting.\u201d \n \n The result was \u201cHeartburn,\u201d a roman a clef about her marriage to Bernstein with the characters changed to a cookbook author married to a randy syndicated columnist; the book also included recipes, including writer Lillian Hellman\u2019s for pot roast. Reviews were mixed, but the notoriety surrounding its publication \u2014 one of the nation\u2019s most prominent writers wreaking revenge on another \u2014 propelled \u201cHeartburn\u201d to the bestseller lists. \n \n \u201cObviously, I wish Nora hadn\u2019t written the book,\u201d Bernstein, then working at ABC News, told The Post at the time. \u201cBut I\u2019ve always known she writes about her life. Nora goes to the supermarket and she uses it for material.\u201d \n \n In 1987, she married Nicholas Pileggi, a journalist, author and screenwriter of such films as the mobster dramas \u201cGoodFellas\u201d (1990) and \u201cCasino\u201d (1995). Besides Pileggi and her three sisters, survivors include two sons from her second marriage, Jacob Bernstein of New York and Max Bernstein of Los Angeles. \n \n As a filmmaker, Ms. Ephron could be derivative. \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Mail\u201d was partly inspired by the pen-pal romance classic \u201cThe Shop Around the Corner\u201d (1940). Ms. Ephron also borrowed heavily from the Cary Grant-Deborah Kerr romantic drama \u201cAn Affair to Remember\u201d (itself a remake of an earlier film) for her 1993 star-crossed romance \u201cSleepless in Seattle\u201d with Hanks and Ryan. \n \n If her career also had its share of movie duds \u2014 among them, the witness-protection comedy \u201cMy Blue Heaven\u201d (1990) and the sitcom remake \u201cBewitched\u201d (2005) \u2014 Ms. Ephron remained widely admired for a productive career in a field that often marginalized women who didn\u2019t produce blockbusters or Oscar champs. \n \n \u201cNora Ephron has quietly been one of the most significant women in film history,\u201d said movie scholar and historian Jeanine D. Basinger. \n \n Ms. Ephron remained a prolific essayist for publications including the New York Times and O magazine. One of her last collections, \u201cI Feel Bad About My Neck: And Other Thoughts on Being a Woman\u201d (2006), was triggered by what she once called \u201cthe menopause that some of us remember so unfondly.\u201d \n \n In keeping with her mother\u2019s admonition, she was candid in sharing her intimate fears of aging. She explored the loss of physical and mental acuity (\u201cI spend time getting into shape; then something breaks\u201d). She expressed astonishment that one of her contemporaries, former White House intern Mimi Fahnestock, had kept silent about her affair with President John F. Kennedy for more than 40 years. \n \n Ms. Ephron wrote of being a White House press aide at the same time and lamented that she was \u201cprobably the only young woman who ever worked in the Kennedy White House whom the president did not make a pass at. Perhaps it was my permanent wave, which was a truly unfortunate mistake. Perhaps it was my wardrobe, which mostly consisted of multicolored dynel dresses that looked like distilled Velveeta cheese.\u201d \n \n \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s because I\u2019m Jewish,\u201d she added. \u201cDon\u2019t laugh, think about it, think about that long, long list of women J.F.K. slept with. Were any Jewish? I don\u2019t think so. \n \n \u201cOn the other hand, perhaps it\u2019s simply because J.F.K. somehow sensed that discretion was not my middle name. I mean, I assure you if anything had gone on between the two of us, you would not have had to wait this long to find it out.\u201d ||||| Nora Ephron , an essayist and humorist in the Dorothy Parker mold (only smarter and funnier, some said) who became one of her era\u2019s most successful screenwriters and filmmakers, making romantic comedy hits like \u201cSleepless in Seattle\u201d and \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally...,\u201d died Tuesday night in Manhattan. She was 71. \n \n The cause was pneumonia brought on by acute myeloid leukemia, her son Jacob Bernstein said. \n \n In a commencement address she delivered in 1996 at Wellesley College, her alma mater, Ms. Ephron recalled that women of her generation weren\u2019t expected to do much of anything. But she wound up having several careers, all of them successfully and many of them simultaneously. \n \n She was a journalist, a blogger, an essayist, a novelist, a playwright, an Oscar-nominated screenwriter and a movie director \u2014 a rarity in a film industry whose directorial ranks were and continue to be dominated by men. Her later box-office success included \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Mail\u201d and \u201cJulie & Julia.\u201d By the end of her life, though remaining remarkably youthful looking, she had even become something of a philosopher about age and its indignities. \n \n \u201cWhy do people write books that say it\u2019s better to be older than to be younger?\u201d she wrote in \u201cI Feel Bad About My Neck,\u201d her 2006 best-selling collection of essays. \u201cIt\u2019s not better. Even if you have all your marbles, you\u2019re constantly reaching for the name of the person you met the day before yesterday.\u201d \n \n Nora Ephron was born on May 19, 1941, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, the eldest of four sisters, all of whom became writers. That was no surprise; writing was the family business. Her father, Henry, and her mother, the former Phoebe Wolkind, were Hollywood screenwriters who wrote, among other films, \u201cCarousel,\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s No Business Like Show Business\u201d and \u201cCaptain Newman, M.D.\u201d \n \n \u201cEverything is copy,\u201d her mother once said, and she and her husband proved it by turning the college-age Nora into a character in a play, later a movie, \u201cTake Her, She\u2019s Mine.\u201d The lesson was not lost on Ms. Ephron, who seldom wrote about her own children but could make sparkling copy out of almost anything else: the wrinkles on her neck, her apartment, cabbage strudel, Teflon pans and the tastelessness of egg-white omelets. \n \n She turned her painful breakup with her second husband, the Watergate journalist Carl Bernstein, into a best-selling novel, \u201cHeartburn,\u201d which she then recycled into a successful movie starring Jack Nicholson as a philandering husband and Meryl Streep as a quick-witted version of Ms. Ephron herself. \n \n When Ms. Ephron was 4, her parents moved from New York to Beverly Hills, where she grew up, graduating from Beverly Hills High School in 1958. At Wellesley, she began writing for the school newspaper, and in the summer of 1961 she was a summer intern in the Kennedy White House. She said later that perhaps her greatest accomplishment there was rescuing the speaker of the house, Sam Rayburn, from a men\u2019s room in which he had inadvertently locked himself. In an essay for The New York Times in 2003, she said she was also probably the only intern that President John F. Kennedy had never hit on. \n \n After graduation from college in 1962, she moved to New York, a city she always adored, intent on becoming a journalist. Her first job was as a mail girl at Newsweek. (There were no mail boys, she later pointed out.) Soon she was contributing to a parody of The New York Post put out during the 1962 newspaper strike. Her piece of it earned her a tryout at The Post, where the publisher, Dorothy Schiff, remarked: \u201cIf they can parody The Post, they can write for it. Hire them.\u201d \n \n Ms. Ephron stayed at The Post for five years, covering stories like the Beatles, the Star of India robbery at the American Museum of Natural History, and a pair of hooded seals at the Coney Island aquarium that refused to mate. \n \n \u201cThe Post was a terrible newspaper in the era I worked there,\u201d she wrote, but added that the experience taught her to write short and to write around a subject, since the kinds of people she was assigned to cover were never going to give her much interview time. \n \n In the late 1960s Ms. Ephron turned to magazine journalism, at Esquire and New York mostly. She quickly made a name for herself by writing frank, funny personal essays \u2014 about the smallness of her breasts, for example \u2014 and tart, sharply observed profiles of people like Ayn Rand, Helen Gurley Brown and the composer and best-selling poet Rod McKuen. Some of these articles were controversial. In one, she criticized Betty Friedan for conducting a \u201cthoroughly irrational\u201d feud with Gloria Steinem; in another, she discharged a withering assessment of Women\u2019s Wear Daily. \n \n But all her articles were characterized by humor and honesty, written in a clear, direct, understated style marked by an impeccable sense of when to deploy the punchline. (Many of her articles were assembled in the collections \u201cWallflower at the Orgy,\u201d \u201cCrazy Salad\u201d and \u201cScribble Scribble.\u201d) \n \n Ms. Ephron made as much fun of herself as of anyone else. She was labeled a practitioner of the New Journalism, with its embrace of novelistic devices in the name of reaching a deeper truth, but she always denied the connection. \u201cI am not a new journalist, whatever that is,\u201d she once wrote. \u201cI just sit here at the typewriter and bang away at the old forms.\u201d \n \n Ms. Ephron got into the movie business more or less by accident after her marriage to Mr. Bernstein in 1976. He and Bob Woodward, his partner in the Watergate investigation, were unhappy with William Goldman\u2019s script for the movie version of their book \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d so Mr. Bernstein and Ms. Ephron took a stab at rewriting it. Their version was ultimately not used, but it was a useful learning experience, she later said, and it brought her to the attention of people in Hollywood. \n \n Her first screenplay, written with her friend Alice Arlen, was for \u201cSilkwood,\u201d a 1983 film based on the life of Karen Silkwood, who died under suspicious circumstances while investigating abuses at a plutonium plant where she had worked. Ms. Arlen was in film school then, and Ms. Ephron had scant experience writing for anything other than the page. But Mike Nichols, who directed the movie (which starred Ms. Streep and Kurt Russell), said that the script made an immediate impression on him. He and Ms. Ephron had become friends when she visited him on the set of \u201cCatch-22.\u201d \n \n Paul Vitello contributed reporting. ||||| Be the first to know about new stories from PowerPost.

Ephron was also an accomplished essayist, novelist and reporter, not to mention the Editor-at-Large of The Huffington Post. \n \n Raised in Beverly Hills, Ephron graduated from Wellesley College before beginning her career as a journalist at the New York Post. She then went on to write about the 1970s women's movement for Esquire. \n \n \"Whatever you choose, however many roads you travel, I hope that you choose not to be a lady,\" Ephron told Wellesley's Class of 1996 in a commencement speech. \"I hope you will find some way to break the rules and make a little trouble out there. And I also hope that you will choose to make some of that trouble on behalf of women.\" \n \n Ephron had the wit and the guts to follow her own advice. \n \n \"She was the funniest feminist, or pseudofeminist, depending on whom you ask,\" Ariel Levy observed in a 2009 profile of Ephron published by The New Yorker. \n \n In her work and in her life, Ephron refused to settle for predictability. \"Every 10 years or so there was a moment when I'd say, even subconsciously, 'Is that all there is?'\" she told Ladies' Home Journal in 2009. \"You've got to find ways to keep it fresh for yourself. To do the thing, as they say, that is a stretch.\" \n \n In 1976, Ephron married Washington Post journalist Carl Bernstein (she was previously married to writer Dan Greenburg for nine years) on the heels of his induction into the journalism hall of fame. Bernstein and his fellow reporter Bob Woodward had chased down the Watergate scandal, which ended the presidency of President Richard Nixon. \n \n \"Carl and Nora were the Brad and Jen of the early eighties,\" Levy wrote. \n \n Like many power couples, this one ended in divorce -- after four years. \n \n Following her second divorce, Ephron wrote the Academy Award-winning screenplay for \"Silkwood,\" starring Kurt Russell and Meryl Streep. Ephron and Streep would collaborate again on 1986's \"Heartburn\" and 2009's \"Julie & Julia.\" \n \n \"Directing movies is the best job there is, that's all,\" Ephron told the UK's Independent in 1993. \"I can hardly say a word after that. It's just a great job. I just want to go on making movies, and some of them will be completely meaningless, except, of course, to me.\" \n \n Ephron is perhaps best known for her 1989 film, \"When Harry Met Sally...,\" which has become a cultural mainstay. \n \n \"'When Harry Met Sally...' is kind of a dark movie,\" director Nicolas Stoller told The Huffington Post in 2012. \"It's sweet and it ends beautifully and romantic, but those are two pretty messed up characters. They're pretty flawed. They do pretty nasty things to each other. It goes to a dark, pretty real place between them. That's why it's a classic. [Screenwriter] Nora Ephron does not pull her punches in that movie.\" \n \n Tom Hanks, who starred in not one, but two now-classic Ephron rom-coms -- \"Sleepless in Seattle\" (1993) and \"You've Got Mail\" (1998) -- said, \"Working on a movie with Nora is kind of like going to a dinner party of hers. There's a lot of great conversation. There's a certain amount of screwing around but, by and large, you wind up talking about what Nora dictates you're going to wind up talking about.\" \n \n In recent years, Ephron had grown increasingly aware of her mortality. In her latest book, \"I Remember Nothing: And other Reflections\" (2010) she writes: \"You do get to a certain point in life where you have to realistically, I think, understand that the days are getting shorter, and you can't put things off thinking you'll get to them someday. If you really want to do them, you better do them. There are simply too many people getting sick, and sooner or later you will. So I'm very much a believer in knowing what it is that you love doing so you can do a great deal of it.\" \n \n Ephron is survived by her husband, screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi and her two sons, Jacob and Max Bernstein. A memorial has been planned for Thursday, June 28, in New York. \n \n For more coverage on remembering Nora Ephron: \n \n Nora Ephron Nora Ephron ||||| Food has brought me joy in times when there wasn\u2019t love or work or sex or money.

    "document": "This website is dedicated to compiling and analyzing the evidence that an out-of-control news media created a false narrative in the Jerry Sandusky story, which effectively framed Joe Paterno for crimes he obviously didn't commit, and of which he may have had extremely limited knowledge (assuming they even happened, which the evidence now strongly suggests they did not). This has resulted in an unjust destruction of a man's entire life's work and legacy, while doing incredible damage to a university and football program which almost certainly did not deserve the unprecedented and illogical punishments they received. \n \n This site is NOT a defense of child sexual abuse. This site is also NOT remotely based on a conspiracy theory (the term \"Framing\" is meant figuratively, and not literally), but rather the notion that an incompetent, ratings-driven media told this story in a way not consistent with the facts, or even basic logic, and are now too invested in their fairytale to ever correct their colossal errors. \n \n We ARE dedicated to exposing the truth in this case and this website is the home of a documentary film on this subject, \"The Framing of Joe Paterno\" as well as our first online book, \"The Betrayal of Joe Paterno and our second online book (which is mostly satirical), \"Perfect Sense.\" \n \n While this site began as a defense of Paterno, after investigating the case for two years and interviewing Sandusky twice in prison, it became obvious that Sandusky himself has also been done a horrendous injustice. While this revelation will be shocking to people who have not followed the case closely, if you look at the evidence here with an open mind, there is little doubt that you will come to the same conclusion. \n \n ************************************************************** \n \n John Ziegler Does Awesome Facebook Interview with Glenn Beck's \"The Blaze\" Network \n \n John Ziegler Provides \"Blaze TV\" With 2 Minute Summary of the Real Story of the Pe\u200bnn State \"Scandal\" \n \n 9/22\u200b/16: Must-Watch!

You have worked diligently to separate yourself by exhibiting unrivaled tenacity, character, and loyalty. Passionate and competitive, you are the leading standard of a first class fan base.\u201d \n \n The letter appears to be some sort of automated mass mailing, and it\u2019s likely a stamp used to sign Franklin\u2019s name. \n \n Sandusky was convicted in June 2012 of 45 counts of sexual abuse involving 10 children, including incidents on campus. He was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in state prison. \n \n He has lost an appeal to the state Supreme Court but maintains he is innocent. \n \n Penn State released the following statement about the letter: \n \n \u201cClearly, a mistake was made and our database needs further updating and cross-referencing. This standard form letter was part of a mass mailing sent to approximately 30,000 people who have had season or single game tickets within the past four years, encouraging them to support the team and help fill Beaver Stadium for every game in 2015.\u201d",

The letter to Sandusky\u2014who of course isn't at his home because he's in prison for about 60 more years\u2014is signed by head football coach James Franklin. KDKA says it obtained photos of the letter from Joe Ziegler, who runs FramingPaterno.com and says he received the missive from \"someone inside the Sandusky household\" other than Sandusky's wife. Penn State released a statement about the letter, explaining that a mass mailing went out to about 30,000 people. \"Clearly, a mistake was made and our database needs further updating and cross-referencing,\" says the statement.

    "document": "Breast implants may cause a small but significant increase in the risk of an extremely rare but treatable type of cancer , the Food and Drug Administration said on Wednesday. \n \n The risk applies to both saline- and silicone-filled implants, and to all women who have them, whether for reconstruction after cancer surgery or for cosmetic enlargement of the breasts. \n \n The cancer, anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, involves the immune system. It is not breast cancer. It is usually a systemic disease, but in the cases linked to implants, the lymphoma grew in the breast, usually in the capsule of scar tissue that formed around the implant. The cases were discovered because women developed symptoms long after they had healed from the implant surgery \u2014 lumps, pain, asymmetry of the breasts, fluid buildup and swelling. \n \n In some cases simply removing the implant and scar tissue gets rid of the disease, but some women might need chemotherapy and radiation, said Dr. William Maisel, the chief scientist and deputy director for science in the drug agency\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. He said there was some evidence, though not conclusive, that the form of this lymphoma found in implant patients was less aggressive than the usual type. \n \n So far, the drug agency said it knew of about 60 cases worldwide, a tiny number compared with the 5 million to 10 million women who have implants. But even that small number appears to be an excess of cases when compared with the usual incidence of the disease: This type of lymphoma in the breast is normally found in only 3 in 100 million women who do not have implants. \n \n Because the risk appears to be so small, the drug agency said, \u201cthe existing data support the continued marketing and use of breast implants.\u201d But it also said that women considering implants should first discuss the information with their doctors. \n \n Women with implants who have no symptoms do not need to do anything special or change their routine health care, Dr. Maisel said. But they should pay attention to any changes and see a doctor if swelling, lumps or other symptoms develop. \n \n Because there is very little data on the lymphoma, Dr. Maisel said, the agency \u201cis not comfortable recommending a specific treatment.\u201d Cases may differ, and women who have the disease need to be treated by a breast surgeon and an oncologist. \n \n The worldwide market for breast implants is roughly $820 million a year and growing at 8 percent a year, according to industry figures. \n \n The Food and Drug Administration said it needed more data and was asking doctors to report confirmed cases to its safety information program, MedWatch. Dr. Maisel said the agency was working with the American Society of Plastic Surgeons to create a registry of cases. He also said that information about the possible link to the cancer would be added to the labeling information sent out with implants. \n \n Dr. Maisel said it was not yet known for sure whether the implants really increase the risk of the cancer, or how they could do so. \n \n \u201cWe do know that both silicone and saline implants are surrounded by silicone,\u201d he said, adding that silicone has been found in cells around breast implants and may stimulate the cells and induce lymphoma in rare cases. But he added, \u201cPlease understand that is speculative and a hypothesis.\u201d \n \n A spokeswoman for Allergan, which makes implants, sent a statement by e-mail saying that the company supported the drug agency\u2019s recommendations. But the statement also said: \u201cReports of ALCL in patients with breast implants are extremely rare and are not to be mistaken for breast cancer. A woman is more likely to be struck by lightning than get this condition.\u201d \n \n Another implant maker, Mentor, did not respond to a telephone message asking for comment on the drug agency announcement. \n \n A medical group, the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, issued a statement saying it supported the development of a registry for the cancer cases in women with implants, but added that implants were \u201cthe most studied device in medical history\u201d and were safe. ||||| The Food and Drug Administration is reviewing a possible link between breast implants and a form of cancer.The federal agency said on Wednesday that 13 years of research citing 34 cases of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) in breast implant patients has shown that individuals who undergo the procedure \"may have a very small but increased risk of developing\" the disease.\"But with an estimated 5 to 10 million breast implant recipients worldwide, agency experts say the known ALCL cases are too few to say conclusively that breast implants cause the disease,\" the statement added Surge Desk offers a quick list of three other common hazards associated with breast implants.Breast augmentation surgery holds the same risks of most other common operations, including seroma and hematoma (fluid and blood build-up). Adverse reaction to anesthesia is a rare occurrence but also a common concern.Ruptured implants are one of the most common health hazards associated with breast augmentation due to the likelihood of leaking silicone, therefore most experts conclude that implants in such cases should be removed as soon as possible. The FDA explains that \"capsular contracture occurs when the scar tissue or capsule that normally forms around the implant tightens and squeezes the implant.\" The condition commonly requires re-operation and, along with ruptured implants, is one of the most common concerns associated with silicone-gel-filled and saline-filled breast implants.",

I can support myself now,\u201d he said. \n \n Coleman was released from prison in November, after DNA evidence cleared him and a co-defendant of the 1994 rape and murder of Antwinica Bridgeman. \n \n He interviewed with the White Sox in February, after his childhood priest reached out to the team on Coleman\u2019s behalf. Coleman had worked a variety of jobs, often more than one at a time, when he caught on with the Sox before the 1992 season. \n \n \u201cI felt comfortable here; everyone was like family to me,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cI\u2019d wake up in the morning and be proud to come to work.\u201d \n \n Since stepping away from the decades of wrongful imprisonment, Coleman\u2019s family has been in awe of his optimism. \n \n \u201cIf I\u2019m miserable, that means everybody else around me will be miserable,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if I\u2019m happy, everybody else will be happy. I don\u2019t have time to be miserable, you know?\u201d \n \n During his time in jail, Coleman often saw old colleagues pulling the rain delay tarp across the field on TV. He bumped into some of them when officially accepting the job in February, and said seeing them in person set him at ease. \n \n His new duties on Monday started with power-washing the Gate 4 entrance to Guaranteed Rate Field, where the team\u2019s 2005 World Series commemoration plaza and sculpture are located. \n \n Coleman has said he hopes to move up to full-time staff in the future. ||||| Nevest Coleman looked around the White Sox ballpark in wonder as he walked down the third base line. \n \n Flanked by colleagues, Harry Smith and Jerry Powe, Coleman marveled at how much the stadium had changed since 1994, when he last worked for the team. As he took in the sights, legendary head groundskeeper Roger \u201cThe Sodfather\u201d Bossard came over and embraced Coleman in a quick hug. \n \n \u201cI saved your spot for you,\u201d Bossard said. \u201cI knew you\u2019d be back.\u201d \n \n And he told him, \u201cJust remember, I\u2019m counting on you to help me with that tarp, too.\u201d \n \n \u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d Coleman replied. \n \n Coleman\u2019s first day back at work Monday couldn\u2019t be more remarkable. He\u2019d been on the White Sox groundskeeping crew in 1994 when he was charged with a heinous rape and murder. \n \n He spent the next 23 years behind bars until DNA evidence last November led prosecutors to vacate Coleman's conviction, leading to his freedom. A Cook County judge granted him a certificate of innocence this month, clearing his name. \n \n Soon after, the White Sox agreed to give him his old job back, helping Coleman realize a dream he often discussed in prison. \n \n Local and national news reporters waited for Coleman\u2019s return at 7 a.m. Smith stood outside the stadium, too, waiting for his old friend. \n \n As Coleman approached Gate 4 at Guaranteed Rate Field, Smith remarked, \u201cHe got a little fatter, but that\u2019s him.\u201d \n \n The two men hugged one another, and went inside, where Coleman, Smith and Powe shared a private moment in the tunnel leading to the field. \n \n Back in the 1990s, the three men worked together on the grounds crew. Prosecutors pushed for Coleman to receive the death penalty after his trial in 1997, but a long line of character witnesses stood up for him at his sentencing hearing, including three White Sox employees. \n \n Smith and Powe remain, while the other no longer works for the team. Powe is now Coleman\u2019s supervisor. \n \n \u201cGlad to see him out. Glad to see him back,\u201d Powe said. \u201cI\u2019m so happy for him, me and the White Sox.\u201d \n \n From the time he left high school, Coleman said he's been on the job. He always wanted to be independent. \n \n \"I don't like to ask anybody for anything,\u201d Coleman told the Tribune last week \u2014 a point he emphasized again Monday. \n \n Even while incarcerated, Coleman kept working, including a job making socks. Still, he particularly enjoyed his time with the Sox and said he considered it a \u201cfamily.\u201d \n \n \u201cI\u2019d wake up in the morning proud to go to work,\u201d Coleman said Monday. \u201cA lot of times, you get people who get jobs, you go to work, you be like, \u2018I don\u2019t want to go.\u2019 Here, I loved it.\u201d \n \n His Monday morning included a flurry of interviews. He sat in the home dugout talking to reporters. \n \n At times, Coleman gazed at the giant advertisements, billboards, and television in the outfield, amazed by the changes. \n \n Reflecting on his newfound freedom, Coleman said, \u201cYou get tired sitting around the house.\u201d \n \n \u201cYou won\u2019t be sitting\u201d here, Smith replied. \n \n After about an hour reuniting with his friends, Coleman changed into a yellow rubber suit. He put on gloves and goggles then headed outside, where Power handed him a power washer to spray the ground clean. \n \n The fairy tale return for Coleman was set in motion by friends and loved ones after he left prison in November. Speaking of his plans after his release, Coleman often mentioned the White Sox. \n \n \u201cI want to sit back for a while, get to know my family, and when the time comes around, go back to Comiskey Park,\u201d Coleman recalled saying. \n \n Nevest Coleman was freed on Nov. 20, 2017, after Cook County prosecutors agreed to a retrial for Coleman, who was convicted of a 1994 rape and murder that recent DNA testing suggests he did not commit. He was given his job back at the White Sox grounds crew and started on Monday, March 26, 2018. (Chicago Tribune) (Chicago Tribune) \n \n The White Sox heard his story, then invited him to 35th and Shields for a job interview. To Coleman\u2019s delight, the team agreed to bring him back. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re grateful that after more than two decades, justice has been carried out for Nevest,\u201d the team said in a statement. \u201cIt has been a long time, but we\u2019re thrilled that we have the opportunity to welcome him back to the White Sox family. We\u2019re looking forward to having Nevest back on Opening Day at home in our ballpark.\u201d \n \n The Rev. William Vanecko, Coleman\u2019s attorney Russell Ainsworth and a cousin, Richard Coleman, were instrumental in making Nevest Coleman\u2019s wish come true. \n \n Ainsworth said he reached out to share Coleman\u2019s story through a relative who works in White Sox ticketing. \n \n Vanecko knew Coleman from his days at Visitation Church in Englewood, down the block from the Coleman family home. The retired Catholic priest called the White Sox and told them about Coleman. \n \n Vanecko said he wanted to ask, \u201cDo you think you can give him 23 years seniority for the (time) he missed?\u201d but bit his tongue. \n \n Coleman\u2019s cousin Richard also called the team. \n \n \u201cHis first wish, before he wished for a hamburger, was to work for the White Sox,\u201d Richard Coleman said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I told them.\u201d \n \n Familiar faces \n \n The White Sox that Coleman knew in 1994 have changed. \n \n The ballpark changed names from Comiskey Park to U.S. Cellular Field and is now Guaranteed Rate Field.

The cancelation was confirmed to AFP by a source familiar with the matter. \n \n While there is indeed reason to believe that King Henry III introduced forks to his subjects after discovering them in Poland, where he had previously been elected king, there is no actual evidence to prove that Kownacki\u2019s claim is true. \n \n Some historians believe the king actually discovered the almighty fork during a stay in Venice after leaving Poland. \n \n Although Kownacki is clearly angry over the canceled invitation to the Euronaval event, his remarks have been condemned by Poland\u2019s liberal opposition, as well as the spokeswoman of the governing Law and Justice (PiS) party, Beata Mazurek, who described the comments as \u201cunfortunate\u201d and \u201cnot very diplomatic.\u201d \n \n \u201cMinister Kownacki is perhaps the first politician to commit diplomatic suicide by fork,\u201d the Polish Polityka weekly said in an article on its website. \n \n The snub came after Poland halted talks with French aviation company Airbus, which were aimed at the purchase of 50 Caracal helicopters by Warsaw. The suspended talks were met with a furious response from Airbus chief executive Tom Enders, who said his company had never been treated so badly by any government. \n \n The talks had been backed by Paris, and the cancellation unleashed tension between the two governments, with French President Francois Hollande postponing a visit to the Polish capital. \n \n READ MORE: New Poland defense minister in hot water over Jewish conspiracy theory \n \n There is disagreement, however, over which side actually ended the talks. \n \n The Euronaval 2016 event is supported by the French Ministry of Defense and the French Navy. The five-day naval and maritime defense exhibition is set to include a range of industry-related security technologies, products, and services. It is seen as one of the most important exhibitions of its kind in Europe. \n \n Diplomacy is not always something Polish defense officials excel at. Earlier this year, Kownacki\u2019s boss, Polish Defense Minister Antoni Macierewicz, lashed out at the US saying \u201cpeople who only built their state in the 18th century are going to tell us what democracy is?\u201d The statement came after the US and the EU criticized Poland over the democratic process relating to the Constitutional Tribunal reform. ||||| Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Was fork use in Europe pioneered by the Poles? \n \n Poland \"taught the French how to use a fork\", a Polish deputy minister has said, amid a continuing row over a cancelled defence contract. \n \n Deputy Defence Minister Bartosz Kownacki also accused the French of lacking \"class\" after losing the multi-billion dollar contract to build 50 Airbus Caracal helicopters for Poland. \n \n A Law and Justice party spokeswoman said the remarks were \"unfortunate\". \n \n Poland is to buy US Black Hawks instead. Airbus has threatened to sue. \n \n Speaking on TV, Mr Kownacki accused France of responding by withdrawing the offer of free accommodation and a car for the Polish delegation at a defence fair in Paris next week. \n \n \"They are a people who learned to eat with a fork from us a few centuries ago. So maybe this is why they are behaving in this way now,\" he said. \n \n MPs from the opposition Civic Platform party called for him to be fired. \n \n A bumpy ride for Poland's Law and Justice party \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Paul Adams examines the political scene in Poland \n \n \"Forkgate\" is the latest in a series of controversies Law and Justice has become embroiled in since taking power last November. \n \n Earlier this month the government retreated from imposing a near-total ban on abortion after massive street protests by women. \n \n The party has also been criticised by the EU for taking control of state media appointments and for reforms to Poland's constitutional court. \n \n Read more: Poland returns to conservative roots with Law and Justice win \n \n The previous Civic Platform-run government had chosen Airbus to supply Poland with helicopters after a tendering process. \n \n But the Law and Justice party, which took power last November, said the deal was bad for Poland and scrapped it. \n \n Forks are believed to have spread from the Byzantine Empire to southern Europe in the early part of the Second Millennium and were commonly used in northern Europe by the 1800s.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Note to self: Don't anger Poland's deputy defense minister, or he'll remind you about your country's uncouth eating habits from the 1500s. That was Bartosz Kownacki's reaction after France apparently rescinded Poland's invite to the Euronaval maritime defense fair next week, the Guardian reports. And that disinvite was because Poland apparently backed out of buying 50 Airbus helicopters and decided to buy US Black Hawks instead; France was said to be backing the original Airbus deal, per the BBC. But while the dialogue started to take a turn for the worse regarding the choppers and the negotiations, it's Kownacki's comments on a particular dining utensil that's now causing a commotion. \"These are the people we taught to eat with a fork a couple of centuries ago, which may explain their behavior today,\" Kownacki sniffed to the TVN24 network, via RT.com. \"This is obvious history, and I invite you to read up on that.\" He was referring to the story that King Henry III of France eagerly introduced the fork to the French population after he first came across it in Poland while he was king there. Historians aren't sure if this is how it actually happened, though, noting Henry also may have stumbled across the fork in Venice. Either way, some aren't happy with Kownacki's dining diss, with a member of Poland's Law and Justice Party calling his remarks \"unfortunate,\" while a Polish weekly notes, \"Minister Kownacki is perhaps the first politician to commit diplomatic suicide by fork.\" (A first-grader was suspended for the eating utensil he brought to school.)",
