Send us your experiences. \n \n (CNN) -- North Korea fired a short-range missile into the Sea of Japan on Sunday, according to South Korea's semiofficial news agency Yonhap, citing a South Korean military official. \n \n On Saturday, North Korea launched three short-range guided missiles into the sea, also known as the East Sea, off the Korean Peninsula's east coast, Yonhap reported. \n \n The missiles on Saturday were fired in a northeasterly direction, away from South Korean waters, the ministry said. \n \n South Korea has beefed up monitoring on North Korea and is maintaining a high level of readiness to deal with any risky developments, the ministry added, according to Yonhap. \n \n According to the Arms Control Association, a U.S.-based organization, short-range guided missiles are generally classified as those traveling less than 1,000 kilometers (about 620 miles). \n \n Tensions in the region have eased since a period last month that included near daily North Korean threats of war. \n \n Opinion: What North Korea could learn from Myanmar \n \n U.S. and South Korean officials feared at that time that Kim Jong Un's regime was planning to carry out a test launch of longer-range ballistic missiles, believed to be Musudans. The South Korean government says they have a maximum range of 3,500 kilometers (2,175 miles). \n \n Andrew Salmon, a journalist and author based in the South Korean capital, Seoul, said North Korea's reported launch of short-range missiles Saturday should not cause the same degree of concern as the launch of a satellite or medium-range Musudan rocket. \n \n \"It's a short-range tactical weapon. If any other country launched this kind of weapon, it's a routine test, nobody would be too worried. It's really simply because it's North Korea doing this that it raises concerns,\" he said. \n \n The situation is much less tense in the region than it was last month, Salmon said. \n \n \"The North Koreans have significantly de-escalated their bellicosity and their rhetoric since the end of April,\" he said. \"The South Korean government, I suspect, will not be strongly condemnatory of this test because right now they are very, very keen to get the North Koreans to the negotiating table.\" \n \n Orphaned and homeless: Surviving the streets of North Korea \n \n The recent tensions flared after the North's long-range rocket launch in December and underground nuclear test in February, both of which were widely condemned. \n \n Pyongyang's fiery rhetoric intensified in March as the U.N. Security Council voted to tighten sanctions on the regime following the nuclear test. \n \n Annual U.S.-South Korean military drills in South Korea also fueled the North's anger, especially when the United States carried out displays of strength that included nuclear-capable B2 stealth bombers. \n \n North Korea is demanding recognition as a nuclear power, something the United States refuses to accept. \n \n Last month's crisis resulted in the closure of the Kaesong Industrial Complex, the last major symbol of inter-Korean cooperation. \n \n How a North Korean camp escapee changed human rights \n \n CNN's Jethro Mullen contributed to this report. ||||| 1 of 4.

Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said he was concerned about North Korea's launch of short-range missiles, urging Pyonyang to refrain from further launches and return to stalled nuclear talks with world powers. \n \n Ban, who spoke to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti during a visit to Moscow, called Saturday's launch a \"provocative action\". \n \n Tension on the Korean peninsula has subsided in the past month, having run high for several weeks after the United Nations Security Council imposed tougher sanctions against Pyongyang following its third nuclear test in February. \n \n The North had for weeks issued nearly daily warnings of impending nuclear war with the South and the United States. \n \n South Korea's Unification Ministry criticized the missile tests as deplorable and urged the North to lower tensions and hold talks over a suspended inter-Korean industrial park in the North's border city of Kaesong. \n \n South Korea pulled out all of its workers from the industrial zone early this month after North Korea withdrew its 53,000 workers as tensions mounted. \n \n (Additional reporting by Alissa de Carbonnel in MOSCOW; Editing by Sanjeev Miglani)",

They decided to try artificial insemination \u2014 something she had yet to tell her own family about. \n \n But now, she said, everyone knows \u2014 thanks to the Pasco County Sheriff's Office. \n \n \"I didn't want any of this,\" she said. \n \n The Sheriff's Office wrote on its official Facebook about a recent mishap she had while trying to store sperm in a thermos with dry ice. By forgetting to remove a rubber O-ring, the container could have exploded. \n \n Nevins said she called the Sheriff's Office non-emergency line for help at 6 p.m. Wednesday. A deputy and firefighters arrived, she said, took the thermos away and safely opened it. They were kind, she said, and left without telling her nosy neighbors what happened. \n \n \"The officer told them it was a private matter,\" Nevins said, \"and he treated it as a private matter.\" \n \n The Sheriff's Office, she complained, did not. The agency on Thursday posted a short explanation of what happened on its Facebook page using a stock photo of a woman with a disgusted expression. \n \n The post didn't use Nevins' name, but she said there were enough details \u2014 her age, location and time of the incident \u2014 for reporters and curious citizens to figure out who she was by searching public records. \n \n That night, a TV news crew appeared on her doorstep with a camera. She spoke to them, but declined to identify herself. She said she spoke to the Tampa Bay Times on the record Friday because her name is \"already out there.\" \n \n The sheriff's Facebook post was shared more than 200 times by Friday. The Pasco County Sheriff's Office has said it's all part of its social media strategy. \n \n \"We attempt to show every day what our officers see in calls and we are a very open agency about the types of calls we see each day,\" Pasco Sheriff Chris Nocco said in a statement. \"This was a very unique call faced by our officers as well as Pasco fire fighters ... make no mistake, this was a potentially dangerous situation ... we are grateful that no damage was done.\" \n \n The Sheriff's Office later released this statement: \"As unusual as this situation was, it was important to provide this type of safety information contained in the post. We always encourage everyone to contact us if they find themselves in a position where they need help. \n \n \"In these types of situations, we never publicly release names or identifying information. Unfortunately, this information was obtained through a public records request of our reports and was published by the media.\" \n \n Nevins, 26, said she was upset the post was not removed Friday. A sheriff's spokeswoman said the agency doesn't delete comments on social media. \n \n The comments on this Facebook post were, as usual, unkind. Some wrote that if Nevins can't follow directions, she shouldn't have a baby. Others made fun of what happened and accused her of wanting money from the county. Others were demeaning. \n \n Many also sided with her, and wrote that the post should be removed. \n \n \"All I'm trying to do is become a mother and I'm being berated for it,\" Nevins said. \n \n Social media has become another tool for law enforcement to announce news and seek information about crimes. The Pasco County Sheriff's Office is the most prolific bay area law enforcement agency on social media, often posting body camera footage of deputies arresting people and even nightly warning for folks to lock their doors after 9 p.m. \n \n The Pasco agency has just over 87,000 followers on Facebook \u2014 more than the followers of the Pinellas and Hillsborough Sheriff's Offices combined. But Pasco's social media presence has come with controversy. \n \n In November, some accused the agency of crossing the line when it posted a photo to Facebook and Twitter of a man in handcuffs, weeping, as deputies held his head back by grabbing his dreadlocks. The post was entitled: \"SAD CRIMINAL OF THE DAY.\" \n \n READ MORE: As its social media grows, Pasco Sheriff's Office posts photo of man crying after his arrest \n \n The Pasco County Sheriff's Office has gained 10,000 followers since then. \n \n Nevins said the agency could have used social media to warn people about the dangers of dry ice without including details of her personal life \u2014 which also resulted in medical information being disclosed. Now she said she feels ashamed and embarrassed. \n \n \"I don't see the comedy in it,\" she said. \n \n All she can do about is unfollow the Pasco County Sheriff's Office on Facebook: \"I'm not going to support a Sheriff's Office that thinks it's okay to belittle their community.\" \n \n Contact Sara DiNatale at [email protected] Follow @sara_dinatale.",

    "document": "PARIS (Reuters) - A cloud of radioactive pollution over Europe in recent weeks indicates that an accident has happened in a nuclear facility in Russia or Kazakhstan in the last week of September, French nuclear safety institute IRSN said on Thursday. \n \n FILE PHOTO: An employee looks at equipment in a new facility at a nuclear waste disposal plant in the town of Fokino in Russia's far-eastern Primorsky region June 24, 2014. REUTERS/Yuri Maltsev \n \n The IRSN ruled out an accident in a nuclear reactor, saying it was likely to be in a nuclear fuel treatment site or center for radioactive medicine. There has been no impact on human health or the environment in Europe, the IRSN said. \n \n IRSN, the technical arm of French nuclear regulator ASN, said in a statement it could not pinpoint the location of the release of radioactive material but that based on weather patterns, the most plausible zone lay south of the Ural mountains, between the Urals and the Volga river. \n \n This could indicate Russia or possibly Kazakhstan, an IRSN official said. \n \n \u201cRussian authorities have said they are not aware of an accident on their territory,\u201d IRSN director Jean-Marc Peres told Reuters. He added that the institute had not yet been in contact with Kazakh authorities. \n \n A spokeswoman for the Russian Emergencies Ministry said she could not immediately comment. It was not immediately possible to reach authorities in Kazakhstan or the Kazakh embassy in Moscow. \n \n Peres said that in recent weeks IRSN and several other nuclear safety institutes in Europe had measured high levels of levels of ruthenium 106, a radioactive nuclide that is the product of splitting atoms in a nuclear reactor and which does not occur naturally. \n \n IRSN estimates that the quantity of ruthenium 106 released was major, between 100 and 300 teraBecquerels, and that if an accident of this magnitude had happened in France it would have required the evacuation or sheltering of people in a radius of a few kilometers around the accident site. \n \n The ruthenium 106 was probably released in a nuclear fuel treatment site or center for radioactive medicine, Peres said. Because of its short half-life of about a year, ruthenium 106 is used in nuclear medicine. \n \n The IRSN ruled out an accident in a nuclear reactor, as that would have led to contamination with other radionuclides too. It also ruled out the crash of a ruthenium-powered satellite as an IAEA investigation has concluded that no ruthenium-containing satellite has fallen back on earth during this period. \n \n Measurement from European stations showed high levels of ruthenium 106 in the atmosphere of the majority of European countries, at the beginning of October, with a steady decrease from Oct. 6 onwards. \n \n The IRSN said that the concentrations of ruthenium 106 in the air that have been recorded in Europe were of no consequence for human health and the environment. \n \n The institute also said that the probability of importation into France of foodstuffs, notably mushrooms, contaminated by ruthenium 106 near the site of the accident is extremely low. ||||| TexteZone1 \n \n Read our Update from February 6, 2018 \n \n Ruthenium 106 has been detected in late September by several European networks involved in the monitoring of atmospheric radioactive contamination, at levels of a few milliBecquerels per cubic meter of air. IRSN's investigations make it possible to provide information on the possible location of the source of the release as well as the order of magnitude of the quantities released. \n \n As soon as it became aware of the first detections of Ruthenium 106 in the atmosphere in Europe, IRSN mobilized all its means of radiological monitoring of the atmosphere and conducted regular analysis of the filters from its monitoring stations. For the period from September 27 to October 13, 2017, only the stations of Seyne-sur-Mer, Nice and Ajaccio revealed the presence of Ruthenium 106 in trace amounts. Since October 13, 2017, Ruthenium 106 is no longer detected in France. \n \n Measurement results from European stations communicated to the Institute since October 3, 2017, have confirmed the presence of Ruthenium 106 in the atmosphere of the majority of European countries. The results obtained for sampling periods later than October 6, 2017, showed a steady decrease in Ruthenium 106 levels, which is currently no longer detected in Europe. \n \n The concentration levels of Ruthenium 106 in the air that have been recorded in Europe and especially in France are of no consequence for human health and for the environment. \n \n Based on the meteorological conditions provided by M\u00e9t\u00e9o France and the measurement results available in European countries, IRSN carried out simulations to locate the release zone, to assess the quantity of ruthenium released, as well as the period and the duration of the release. \n \n The map below summarizes the results obtained and confirms that the most plausible zone of release lies between the Volga and the Urals without it being possible, with the available data, to specify the exact location of the point of release. Indeed, it is in this geographical area that the simulation of a ruthenium release makes it possible to better reproduce the measurements obtained in Europe. \n \n Map showing the plausibility of the origin of the release: \n \n For the most plausible zone of release, the quantity of Ruthenium 106 released estimated by IRSN simulations is very important, between 100 and 300 teraBecquerels. The release, accidental with regard to the quantity released, would have occurred during the last week of September 2017. \n \n Because of the quantities released, the consequences of an accident of this magnitude in France would have required to implement locally measures of protection of the populations on a radius of the order of a few kilometres around the location of the release. \n \n For foodstuffs, the exceeding of maximum permitted levels (1250 Bq/kg for Ruthenium 106 for non-milk products) would be observed over distances of the order of a few tens of kilometres around the location of the release. \n \n The possibility of exceeding maximum permitted levels near the accident site led IRSN to study the scenario of importing foodstuffs from this area. From this analysis, IRSN considers, on the one hand, that the probability of a scenario that would see the importation into France of foodstuffs (especially mushrooms) contaminated by Ruthenium 106 near the source of the release is extremely low and, on the other hand, the potential health risk associated with this scenario is also very low. It does not therefore appear necessary to introduce systematic controls on the contamination of imported foods. \n \n Download IRSN information report from Novembre 9, 2017 \u00ab Detection of Ruthenium 106 in France and in Europe: Results of IRSN\u2019s investigations \u00bb (PDF)",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A nuclear accident happened somewhere in Russia or Kazakhstan during the last week of September and was kept very quiet, the French nuclear safety institute IRSN has concluded after analyzing a mysterious radioactive cloud that appeared over Europe last month. IRSN researchers say they detected high levels of ruthenium 106, a type of atom that does not occur in nature and is only found when atoms are split in reactors, Reuters reports. The cloud was at its peak during the first week in October and dissipated until it could not be detected in France by Oct. 13, according to IRSN, which says its analysis of weather patterns points to a source between the Ural mountains and the Volga river. The institute, which says other European nuclear regulators have made similar findings, has ruled out the crash of a radioactive satellite or an accident at a nuclear reactor as the source of the cloud. It says the most likely source was either a facility dealing with spent nuclear fuel or a facility for radioactive medicine. Russian authorities say they're not aware of any accident in the area, while Kazakh authorities haven't been reached for comment yet, IRSN says. The institute says the cloud itself is harmless and is unlikely to contaminate food, though it says there must have been a very large amount of ruthenium 106 released at the accident site, enough that would have theoretically warranted an evacuation of a radius of several miles.",

    "document": "Jihan Nassar, a homemaker in Corona, Calif., is listed as a $500 donor to the campaign of Florida Gov. Charlie Crist. But she insists she never gave a dime. \n \n ''I can't make any donations, financially,'' Nassar said Friday. \"We never made any donations, sir. I have no idea what you are talking about.'' \n \n Nassar and her husband, Waleed, are among more than three dozen California donors listed as giving to Crist's campaign on June 19, 2006 -- donations bundled by a controversial Delray Beach defense contractor now under scrutiny for contributions to GOP presidential candidate John McCain. \n \n On Thursday, the McCain campaign said it would return $50,000 in donations tied to businessman Harry Sargeant III, finance chairman of the Florida Republican Party and a college buddy of Crist's. Sargeant has said the California donors were solicited by a business partner, Mustafa Abu Naba'a, a Jordanian with an apartment in Miami-Dade, records show. \n \n McCain -- a champion of campaign-finance reform in the U.S. Senate -- said he would return the donations after news articles in the Washington Post and the New York Times raised questions about their legitimacy. \n \n In a letter to the donors, the campaign warned that foreign nationals cannot donate money to U.S. campaigns and contributors cannot be reimbursed by another donor as a way to get around contribution limits. \n \n Some donors whose contributions are being returned by McCain's campaign were also listed as contributors to Crist on June 19, 2006. \n \n That day, Crist received more than $25,000 in contributions from California, records show, including $500 checks from two stereo stores and two Wienerschnitzel hot-dog restaurants outside Los Angeles. \n \n Zouhair El Srouji, a 40-year-old accountant in Wildomar, Calif., initially told a reporter on Friday that he had no memory of a $500 donation to the Florida governor. \n \n After reviewing campaign records, however, he said he recalled that a campaign contribution was requested by his employer -- though he couldn't recall who asked him to give. \n \n ''It took a lot of convincing, but they said he was a good man and needed our help, and I guess I'm a sucker for helping good people,'' El Srouji said. \n \n Reached briefly to talk about his just-announced Dec. 12 wedding date with fiancee Carole Rome, Crist said he wasn't familiar with the specifics and referred questions to his former campaign manager, George LeMieux. ''It's all good,'' Crist said. \n \n Earlier in the week, he called Sargeant \"a great patriot.'' \n \n LeMieux said he would review the donations highlighted by The Miami Herald. \n \n He said every effort was made during the campaign to verify all donations and make sure they did not exceed campaign finance limits. Crist received more than 18,000 checks in the Republican primary, he said. \n \n ''With that volume of checks, we're not going to know everyone who gives money,'' LeMieux said. \"I remember many a long weekend trying to look up information about donors on the Internet.'' \n \n The controversy over the donations comes at an awkward time for Crist, one of several politicians auditioning to be McCain's vice-presidential candidate. \n \n Sargeant, a fraternity brother of Crist's at Florida State University, was one of the governor's biggest supporters in the 2006 campaign, and he has emerged in recent months as a top fundraiser for McCain as well. \n \n Sargeant is among 63 McCain fundraisers nationwide who have bundled more than $500,000 in checks each. Donations to presidential candidates are capped at $2,300, but bundlers get around the limit by collecting checks from friends, business associates and relatives. \n \n Sargeant also donated $30,000 of his own money to a joint McCain-GOP fund in May, records show. Before turning his attention to McCain, Sargeant also raised money for presidential candidates Rudy Giuliani and Hillary Clinton. \n \n On March 5 -- the same day President Bush received McCain at the White House as the GOP's presumptive nominee -- Sargeant hosted a fundraiser for McCain at his $8.3 million Delray Beach home. \n \n Sid Dinerstein, chairman of the Palm Beach County Republican Party, attended the affair at the waterfront home. He said McCain is ''bending over backwards'' by returning contributions. \n \n ''By giving the money back he is raising flags that weren't even there,'' Dinerstein said. \"John McCain puts the ethics bar higher than anyone in national politics.'' \n \n Sargeant could not be reached for comment on Friday, and a lawyer for his company did not respond to a list of e-mailed questions. \n \n Tallahassee lobbyist Brian Ballard, a top fundraiser for both Crist and McCain, said the reason Sargeant took the position as the state GOP's finance chairman was simple: Crist asked him to do it. \n \n Sargeant was not involved in President Bush's campaigns, which took the practice of bundling to new heights by designating its biggest givers as ''Rangers'' and \"Pioneers.'' \n \n ''Harry does politics now only because his friend of 30 years asked him to take this role,'' Ballard said. \"He's very much apolitical. He runs tankers and ports.'' \n \n Under Sargeant's leadership, the Republican Party of Florida raised $15 million in 2007, a record for a nonelection year. Chairman Jim Greer said he has no reason to review the checks Sargeant has delivered to the party. \n \n ''He continues to have my full support and appreciation for his service,'' Greer said. \"He's very dedicated and exhibited a high degree of integrity.'' \n \n For someone at the top of the fundraising heap, Sargeant has kept a low profile. Several activists and fundraisers who have been involved in Republican politics for years said they had never met him. \n \n But Sargeant's business has received some unwanted attention. \n \n Sargeant is a partner with Abu Naba'a in International Oil Trading Co., a Boca Raton firm with Defense Department contracts to ship oil to the military in Iraq. Federal records show the company received $601 million in the 2007 budget year. \n \n In June, U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., head of a congressional oversight committee, sent a letter to Sargeant seeking records in a probe of alleged overcharging of the military for fuel costs. \n \n Sargeant and Abu Naba'a have also been accused of fraud by the brother-in-law of the king of Jordan, who filed a lawsuit in West Palm Beach in April saying the pair cut him out of the Pentagon contracts after he helped them secure the deal. \n \n The ex-partner, Mohammad Al-Saleh, said he helped the company win the blessing of the Jordanian government to ship the oil through that country to Iraq -- a requirement of the Pentagon contracts, according to the suit. Al-Saleh said Sargeant and Abu Naba'a failed to pay him at least $13 million. \n \n In court papers, lawyers for Sargeant and Abu Naba'a denied any wrongdoing and said the suit should be moved to Jordan. Sargeant and his family also own domestic shipping and asphalt companies, records show. ||||| You've probably never heard of Marty Martin. He spent most of his life as an anonymous CIA operative. But he very recently came out of the closet as the man Bush put in charge of finding Osama bin Laden in the aftermath of 9/11, and guess what? It turns out the man Bush put in charge of finding bin Laden is an extremely shady and allegedly corrupt war profiteer. Who would have thought? \n \n Martin, of course, never succeeded in catching bin Laden. He ran the CIA's bin Laden unit from 2002 to 2004, a fact that we now know only because he emerged to grab some credit for bin Laden's death and celebrate the agency's discontinued torture program: \"We got beat up for it, but those efforts led to this great day,\" he told the Associated Press three weeks ago. Prior to that, he was just a nondescript former agency official who went into the security consulting business after retiring. The closest hint to just how key an official he was came from references to a \"Marty M.\"\u2014described as a sort of Jack Bauer of the bayou\u2014in former CIA director George Tenet's memoir. \n \n Now that we know who Martin really is, we can get a sense of what kind of guy Bush turned to for arguably the most crucial job in the war on terror. \n \n 1. The Kind of Guy Who Bilks Taxpayers for His Own Enrichment \n \n In 2007, after leaving the CIA, Martin joined International Oil Trading Company, a Florida company that delivered fuel to U.S. forces in the Middle East. In 2008, congressional investigators accused it of ripping off the Pentagon to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. This year, the Pentagon's own audit found that the company overcharged the government by as much as $204 million on a series of massive Iraq war fuel contracts. \n \n 2. The Kind of Guy Who Bribes Foreign Officials \n \n According to a Florida lawsuit against International Oil's owner Harry Sargeant III, Martin paid a $9 million bribe to the head of the Jordanian intelligence service back in 2007 to secure his company's exclusive rights to ship fuel across Jordan to U.S bases in Iraq. (That allegation comes from the Jordanian king's brother-in-law, Mohammad al-Saleh, who is suing Sargeant for purportedly screwing him out of a $100 million stake in the company.) \n \n 3. The Kind of Guy Who Helps Launder Illegal Political Contributions \n \n In 2008, the Washington Post reported that Sargeant, a billionaire, raised funds for John McCain's presidential campaign with help from an unnamed \"former head of the bin Laden unit\" who worked for him. The men reportedly skirted campaign finance laws by funneling the money through Arab-American \"straw donors.\" McCain quickly returned $50,000 of Sargeant's lucre. The Post never named the ex-chief of the CIA bin Laden unit involved in the fundraising, but unless two former heads of the bin Laden unit were working for Sargeant at the time, that man was Marty Martin. \n \n 4. The Kind of Guy Who Gets Totally Psyched When People Die In a War He Profits From \n \n In a court filing last week, attorneys for al-Saleh quoted from an e-mail that Martin wrote to Sargeant in 2008 in which he appeared to gloat over the escalation of violence in Iraq: \n \n Fyi, word of a 're-surge' is floating around amidst shit hitting the fan in Iraq today. \u263a \n \n The \"shit hitting the fan\" was the Battle of Basra, the Iraqi Army's attempt in March 2008 to finally roll up militias loyal to Moqtada al Sadr. It was widely seen as a debacle and victory for al-Sadr, and many feared the conflict threatened to reignite the civil war. That month, 40 Americans died in Iraq. \u263a! \n \n In other words, he's a former CIA agent. Anyway, that's Marty Martin, the guy Bush put in charge of the bin Laden hunt. Glad it worked out for him. \n \n Harry Sargeant's lawyers couldn't be reached for comment on this story. The CIA declined to comment. And Marty Martin's bin Laden-hunting predecessor, Michael Scheuer \u2013- who served for two years as a special adviser to Martin's unit \u2013- claims to have never heard of Marty Martin (which we can only presume is a CIA first-rule-of-Fight-Club omerta thing). Reached on his phone, Martin said: \"No no, man. I don't want to talk to you, man,\" and hung up before we had a chance to ask a question. \n \n [Image via AP] ||||| A member of Jordan\u2019s royal family is accusing an American oilman and former GOP fundraiser of bribing the Jordanian government to facilitate his fuel shipments through the country to U.S. forces in Iraq. \n \n The allegation emerged in a civil lawsuit pitting the billionaire American businessman, Harry Sargeant III, against an ex-business partner, Mohammad al-Saleh, the brother-in-law of Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II. \n \n Al-Saleh, the plaintiff in the case first reported by NBC News in May 2008, claims that he was cut out of a lucrative one-third share in Sargeant\u2019s firm, the International Oil Trading Co., based in Boca Raton, Fla., and replaced by an ex-CIA official with deep contacts in the Jordanian government. \n \n The crux of the bribery allegation involves a $9 million wire transfer from Sargeant\u2019s firm, directed to a mysterious figure in Jordan\u2019s intelligence agency identified in court documents only as \u201cPasha.\u201d \n \n Sargeant\u2019s lawyers acknowledge that \u201cPasha\u201d was \u201cpossibly\u201d Gen. Mohammad Dahabi, then head of the General Intelligence Directorate (GID), Jordan\u2019s intelligence agency. A source inside the Jordanian government confirmed that. \n \n Kickback or legitimate payment? \n \n Al-Saleh\u2019s lawyers argue in court documents that the money was a kickback to curry favor with the GID and secure Sargeant\u2019s continued use of Jordanian thoroughfares to ship fuel to U.S. bases in western Iraq. \n \n Sargeant\u2019s lawyers insist the $9 million was payment to a \u201cquasi-government\u201d Jordanian company that was a subcontractor for Sargeant\u2019s firm and deny any wrongdoing by their client. \n \n Sargeant, a retired Marine pilot and former official of the Florida state GOP, was once among the Pentagon\u2019s closest business partners, winning billions of dollars in fuel contracts in the Iraq war. But fallout from the contracts has eroded Sargeant\u2019s reputation. \n \n A congressional probe led by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., concluded in October 2008 that Sargeant had exploited his close ties with the Jordanian monarchy to win an exclusive license \u2014 a so-called letter of authorization that permitted his company to ship the fuel through Jordan to Iraq, as the contracts required. \n \n Sargeant used his \u201ceffective monopoly\u201d over the supply routes to grossly overcharge the Pentagon, Waxman wrote in a letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates. Waxman called it \u201cthe worst form of war profiteering.\u201d \n \n Shortly after the probe, Sargeant resigned as the finance chairman of the Florida Republican Party. \n \n Last month, a Pentagon audit requested by Waxman found that Sargeant was overpaid by as much as $204 million for the fuel contracts, which were worth nearly $2.7 billion over six years. The Defense Department accepted Sargeant\u2019s inflated prices because no other competitor could get the letter of authorization from the Jordanian government, the audit said. \n \n Ex-CIA agent hired \n \n Now Al-Saleh\u2019s lawsuit is dredging up new information about Sargeant\u2019s dealings with the Jordanian government. \n \n Among other things, court records indicate that Sargeant hired Marty Martin, a former member of the CIA\u2019s Senior Intelligence Service, to help manage his oil firm in 2007. Martin \u2014 identified in court documents as a former Middle East CIA station chief \u2014 leveraged his contacts in the Arab world to cement Sargeant\u2019s relationship with the Jordanian government, even as the king\u2019s brother-in-law was being forced out of the oil company and defrauded, al-Saleh\u2019s lawyers contend. \n \n The money transfer at the core of the bribery allegation is revealed in a November 2007 email from Martin to a representative of the Jordanian intelligence service. In it, Martin wrote that $4.5 million had been \u201ctransferred to the designated account for the Pasha\u2019s attention.\u201d \n \n Three days later, Martin wrote again to confirm that a \u201csecond tranche of $4.5 million should also hit your account today.\u201d He added, \u201cPlease advise Pasha.\u201d \n \n A high-placed source inside the Jordanian government confirmed that the \u201cPasha\u201d alluded to in the emails was Dahabi, then head of the GID. The source, who requested anonymity, said the payments were \u201cbeing made to the GID,\u201d and added, \u201cA simple trace on the wires will easily reveal who the beneficiaries were and the bank account details.\u201d \n \n The GID is the Jordanian counterpart to the CIA, and the two agencies have reportedly cooperated in the secret rendition of terrorist suspects. In a report this year, Human Rights Watch portrayed the GID as a vast shadow force in Jordan, harassing dissidents and \u201cinfluenc(ing) decisions in most aspects of Jordanian public life.\u201d \n \n Violation of anti-bribery law alleged \n \n Al-Saleh\u2019s lawyers allege in court documents that Martin\u2019s payments to the GID may have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. \n \n But Sargeant\u2019s lawyers, Mark Tuohey and Roger Kobert, said the wires were destined for Taurus Trading Co., a Jordanian firm that provided ground services for Sargeant as a subcontractor. The lawyers characterized Taurus Trading Co. as a \u201cquasi-government entity\u201d and said the Jordanian government was a paid third party in Sargeant\u2019s defense work. Taurus Trading Co. did not respond to emails requesting comment, nor did the Jordanian Embassy in Washington. \n \n Asked why the director of the GID would be involved in the wire transfers, Kobert responded, \u201cYou\u2019d have to ask him.\u201d \n \n Dahabi, who was the GID\u2019s director in 2007, did not answer calls to his cellphone. \n \n Martin did not reply to emails or phone calls seeking comment. \n \n Sargeant\u2019s lawyers accuse al-Saleh\u2019s side of taking the wire transfers out of context. \u201cThey try to make something very mundane and boring sound sexy,\u201d said Kobert. \u201cIt\u2019s not sexy.\u201d \n \n Al-Saleh\u2019s lawyers have cited another email that they argue shows Martin plotting to cut al-Saleh out of his one-third stake in the oil firm. ||||| WASHINGTON -- When one of Osama bin Laden's most trusted aides picked up the phone last year, he unknowingly led U.S. pursuers to the doorstep of his boss, the world's most wanted terrorist. \n \n That phone call, recounted Monday by a U.S. official, ended a years-long search for bin Laden's personal courier, the key break in a worldwide manhunt. The courier, in turn, led U.S. intelligence to a walled compound in northeast Pakistan, where a team of Navy SEALs shot bin Laden to death. \n \n The violent final minutes were the culmination of years of intelligence work. Inside the CIA team hunting bin Laden, it always was clear that bin Laden's vulnerability was his couriers. He was too smart to let al-Qaida foot soldiers, or even his senior commanders, know his hideout. But if he wanted to get his messages out, somebody had to carry them, someone bin Laden trusted with his life. \n \n In a secret CIA prison in Eastern Europe years ago, al-Qaida's No. 3 leader, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, gave authorities the nicknames of several of bin Laden's couriers, four former U.S. intelligence officials said. Those names were among thousands of leads the CIA was pursuing. \n \n One man became a particular interest for the agency when another detainee, Abu Faraj al-Libi, told interrogators that when he was promoted to succeed Mohammed as al-Qaida's operational leader he received the word through a courier. Only bin Laden would have given al-Libi that promotion, CIA officials believed. \n \n If they could find that courier, they'd find bin Laden. \n \n The revelation that intelligence gleaned from the CIA's so-called black sites helped kill bin Laden was seen as vindication for many intelligence officials who have been repeatedly investigated and criticized for their involvement in a program that involved the harshest interrogation methods in U.S. history. \n \n \"We got beat up for it, but those efforts led to this great day,\" said Marty Martin, a retired CIA officer who for years led the hunt for bin Laden. \n \n Mohammed did not reveal the names while being subjected to the simulated drowning technique known as waterboarding, former officials said. He identified them many months later under standard interrogation, they said, leaving it once again up for debate as to whether the harsh technique was a valuable tool or an unnecessarily violent tactic. \n \n It took years of work for intelligence agencies to identify the courier's real name, which officials are not disclosing. When they did identify him, he was nowhere to be found. The CIA's sources didn't know where he was hiding. Bin Laden was famously insistent that no phones or computers be used near him, so the eavesdroppers at the National Security Agency kept coming up cold. \n \n Then in the middle of last year, the courier had a telephone conversation with someone who was being monitored by U.S. intelligence, according to an American official, who like others interviewed for this story spoke only on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive operation. The courier was located somewhere away from bin Laden's hideout when he had the discussion, but it was enough to help intelligence officials locate and watch him. \n \n In August 2010, the courier unknowingly led authorities to a compound in the northeast Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where al-Libi had once lived. The walls surrounding the property were as high as 18 feet and topped with barbed wire. Intelligence officials had known about the house for years, but they always suspected that bin Laden would be surrounded by heavily armed security guards. Nobody patrolled the compound in Abbottabad. \n \n In fact, nobody came or went. And no telephone or Internet lines ran from the compound. The CIA soon believed that bin Laden was hiding in plain sight, in a hideout especially built to go unnoticed. But since bin Laden never traveled and nobody could get onto the compound without passing through two security gates, there was no way to be sure. \n \n Despite that uncertainty, intelligence officials realized this could represent the best chance ever to get to bin Laden. They decided not to share the information with anyone, including staunch counterterrorism allies such as Britain, Canada and Australia. \n \n By mid-February, the officials were convinced a \"high-value target\" was hiding in the compound. President Barack Obama wanted to take action. \n \n \"They were confident and their confidence was growing: 'This is different. This intelligence case is different. What we see in this compound is different than anything we've ever seen before,'\" John Brennan, the president's top counterterrorism adviser, said Monday. \"I was confident that we had the basis to take action.\" \n \n Options were limited. The compound was in a residential neighborhood in a sovereign country. If Obama ordered an airstrike and bin Laden was not in the compound, it would be a huge diplomatic problem. Even if Obama was right, obliterating the compound might make it nearly impossible to confirm bin Laden's death. \n \n Said Brennan: \"The president had to evaluate the strength of that information, and then made what I believe was one of the most gutsiest calls of any president in recent memory.\" \n \n Obama tapped two dozen members of the Navy's elite SEAL Team Six to carry out a raid with surgical accuracy. \n \n Before dawn Monday morning, a pair of helicopters left Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan. The choppers entered Pakistani airspace using sophisticated technology intended to evade that country's radar systems, a U.S. official said. \n \n Officially, it was a kill-or-capture mission, since the U.S. doesn't kill unarmed people trying to surrender. But it was clear from the beginning that whoever was behind those walls had no intention of surrendering, two U.S. officials said. \n \n The helicopters lowered into the compound, dropping the SEALs behind the walls. No shots were fired, but shortly after the team hit the ground, one of the helicopters came crashing down and rolled onto its side for reasons the government has yet to explain. None of the SEALs was injured, however, and the mission continued uninterrupted. \n \n With the CIA and White House monitoring the situation in real time \u2013 presumably by live satellite feed or video carried by the SEALs \u2013 the team stormed the compound. \n \n Thanks to sophisticated satellite monitoring, U.S. forces knew they'd likely find bin Laden's family on the second and third floors of one of the buildings on the property, officials said. The SEALs secured the rest of the property first, then proceeded to the room where bin Laden was hiding. In the ensuing firefight, Brennan said, bin Laden used a woman as a human shield. \n \n The SEALs killed bin Laden with a bullet to the head. Using the call sign for his visual identification, one of the soldiers communicated that \"Geronimo\" had been killed in action, according to a U.S. official. \n \n Bin Laden's body was immediately identifiable, but the U.S. also conducted DNA testing that identified him with near 100 percent certainty, senior administration officials said. Photo analysis by the CIA, confirmation on site by a woman believed to be bin Laden's wife, and matching physical features such as bin Laden's height all helped confirm the identification. At the White House, there was no doubt. \n \n \"I think the accomplishment that very brave personnel from the United States government were able to realize yesterday is a defining moment in the war against al-Qaida, the war on terrorism, by decapitating the head of the snake known as al-Qaida,\" Brennan said. \n \n U.S. forces searched the compound and flew away with documents, hard drives and DVDs that could provide valuable intelligence about al-Qaida, a U.S. official said. The entire operation took about 40 minutes, officials said. \n \n Bin Laden's body was flown to the USS Carl Vinson in the North Arabian sea, a senior defense official said. There, aboard a U.S. warship, officials conducted a traditional Islamic burial ritual. Bin Laden's body was washed and placed in a white sheet. He was placed in a weighted bag that, after religious remarks by a military officer, was slipped into the sea about 2 a.m. EDT Monday. \n \n Said the president: \"I think we can all agree this is a good day for America.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Kimberly Dozier, Eileen Sullivan and Ben Feller in Washington and Kathy Gannon in Islamabad, Pakistan contributed to this report.",

    "document": "Jesse Jackson Jr. and wife Sandi: From power couple to prison inmates BY NATASHA KORECKI AND LYNN SWEET Staff Reporters \n \n Updated: \n \n WASHINGTON \u2014 They were congressman and alderman, candidate and campaign chief. \n \n They are also husband and wife, father and mother. \n \n And on Wednesday, in an extraordinary sentencing hearing, Jesse Jackson Jr. and Sandi Jackson added another layer of complexity to their relationship: Both will be prison inmates. \n \n Former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. was sentenced to 2 1/2 years behind bars for stealing $750,0000 from his campaign fund while former Ald. Sandi Jackson (7th) is to serve one year for filing false tax returns. \n \n Sandi Jackson, 49, appeared stunned by the imposition of a prison term, her face frozen and drained of color after the judge ordered a 12-month sentence that offers no ability to earn time off for good behavior. \n \n The former alderman later retreated to her defense chair and dropped her head. Sandi Jackson\u2019s lawyers had vigorously argued for probation. \n \n The former congressman received half of the nearly five years he could have faced. Jackson Jr., 48, who had been blowing his nose and sobbing during his remarks to the judge, appeared to break into a half-grin as the news of the sentence settled in. \n \n U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson took the unusual step of allowing the Jacksons -- parents of a 13 year old and 9 year old \u2014 to stagger their sentences. And in one of the more surreal moments of the proceedings, the judge recessed to allow husband and wife to confer over who would go to prison first. It was determined to be Jesse Jackson, who will report around Nov. 1. \n \n \u201cThere may be blurred lines for congressmen to follow when their lives are political. This case did not come near those areas,\u201d said Judge Jackson (no relation). She said to impose no prison time would mean there was one set of rules for the \u201cwell-connected and one for everybody else. I cannot do it and I will not do it.\u201d \n \n The judge rejected Jackson Jr.\u2019s mental health issues as a defense saying that his string of accomplishments in life \u2014 propped up by a political family dynasty \u2014 \u201cpoints to only one conclusion, and that is that you knew better.\u201d \n \n She said Jackson could not claim his bipolar disorder as a mitigating factor because his series of purchases \u201cwere not all sudden and extraordinary purchases.\u201d \n \n \u201cThis was a knowing, organized misconduct that was repeated and then covered up over the years,\u201d the judge said. \n \n Still, she lauded Jackson Jr. for his accomplishments as congressman, saying he went beyond just doing his job. That included bringing clean drinking water to Ford Heights. She also praised a record he once held for not missing a vote in Congress in 13 years. \n \n The judge\u2019s remarks came after emotional pleas from both Jacksons. \n \n The former congressman, addressing the court, stopped several times before the judge, to blow his nose in a tissue. At one point, he tried talking but whispered \u201cI can\u2019t see\u201d because his crying was fogging up his glasses. \n \n \u201cI didn\u2019t separate my personal life from my political life, and I couldn\u2019t be more wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cI take responsibility for my actions.\u201d He added: \u201cI am the example for the whole Congress.\u201d \n \n He asked to be sent to a prison camp in Montgomery, Ala. \n \n \u201cI want to make it a little inconvenient for everybody to get to me,\u201d he muttered through tears. \n \n If the judge rejected the mental health defense, she appeared equally unimpressed by Sandi Jackson\u2019s contention that she should escape prison because she needed to be there for her children. \n \n \u201cI stand before you today asking for mercy,\u201d Sandi Jackson said. \u201cI ask to continue to provide for my children.\u201d \n \n Sandi Jackson\u2019s attorney, Dan Webb, implored the judge to allow his client to work off her sentence as community service. \u201cTo take the mother away \u2026 would be an unbearable burden on these two children,\u201d Webb said. \n \n The judge later addressed the issue. \n \n \u201cThe message has not been subtle. The pleadings have laid this on very, very thick,\u201d the judge replied. \u201cIt is not the court that put your children in this position. It is not the government that put your children in this position.\u201d \n \n She cited spending of campaign funds that included $5,000 in furs and parkas \u201cin one day,\u201d spa trips, Disney trips and expenses in Las Vegas, then ordered Sandi Jackson to pay $22,000 in restitution separate from what her husband owed. \n \n The judge made clear that Sandi Jackson was not sentenced to a year and a day, which could have qualified her for good time and would have meant she would have effectively served 10 months in prison. Instead, under the rules of federal sentencing, she will serve a longer sentence with the judge sentencing her to one year. \n \n A prison term for the once-powerful Jesse Jackson Jr. marks a spectacular fall from grace for the son of the famed civil rights leader, the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Before court, the elder Jackson and his family took part in a prayer circle led by Bishop Gordon Simon of Tri-State Baptist Church in Chicago. \n \n The younger Jackson easily sailed to re-election term after term in his South Side and south suburban 2nd Congressional District. \n \n All told, he spent 17 years serving the district until he resigned in disgrace last November. \n \n On Wednesday, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, upon seeing his son in the Washington, D.C., federal courthouse cafeteria, stood up and warmly embraced him. Jackson\u2019s brothers, Yusef and Jonathan, as well as his sister, Santita, also greeted their brother as the family huddled in the cafeteria just before facing a federal judge. \n \n It was clear the day was expected to bring anguish for the incredibly public family: The Jacksons had hired a public relations consultant who was on hand, as was Judy Smith, the crisis counselor who inspired the ABC hit series \u201cScandal.\u201d \n \n The senior Jackson later issued a statement saying he was proud that his son stood in court and accepted responsibility for his actions. \n \n \u201cHe was remorseful. He is recovering. He has highs and lows. I have a greater appreciation for it now,\u201d the reverend said. \u201cHe turned to us as a family and said that \u2018I let you down.\u2019 ... I think we let him down, I may have missed the signs and I was apologetic to him.\u201d \n \n Even in a state like Illinois, where governors, aldermen and congressmen have routinely gone to prison, the Wednesday hearing was remarkably rare as it involved a powerful couple who together saw their political demise in the same courtroom. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s no exact parallel,\u201d said Dick Simpson, a longtime political observer and former Chicago alderman. The closest parallel is Illinois having four of the last seven governors in prison, he said. \n \n Simpson added that from 1976 to 2011 there were 18,069 corruption cases in Illinois. \u201cThere have been a couple of husbands of wives, but I don\u2019t remember any that parallel the Jacksons,\u201d he said. \u201cJesse Jr. was sort of African American royalty. He was seen as a rising star, who could have been governor, senator maybe mayor.\u201d \n \n The rejection of some of their arguments notwithstanding, the judge did sentence both Jacksons to terms that were less than or at the low end of a federal guideline range. She credited each with admitting to the crimes and pleading guilty, sparing the government the expense of trial. \n \n Assistant U.S. Attorney Matt Graves took exception to Sandi Jackson\u2019s argument for probation. Graves said considered independently of her husband, Sandi Jackson\u2019s case was one of the worst involving personal use of campaign funds that had \u201cever been documented.\u201d \n \n Among the items Sandi Jackson purchased with the funds were \u201cthousands of dollars at salons and spa treatments,\u201d a Disney vacation and a subzero freezer for their Chicago home, he said. She spent tens upon tens of thousands of dollars using the credit card of her husband\u2019s congressional funds. She filed falsified reports to the Federal Election Commission and knowingly signed off on IRS tax forms she knew were inaccurate. \n \n Graves noted the Jacksons\u2019 combined income in 2011 was nearly $350,000, putting the couple among the top 10 percent household incomes in the country and giving them no financial need to steal. \n \n Graves also questioned Jackson Jr.\u2019s medical condition, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s quite clear there\u2019s no \u2018there\u2019 there,\u201d arguing that Jackson Jr. shouldn\u2019t get a lighter sentence because of any medical issues. \n \n \u201cJesse Jackson Jr.\u2019s journey from the halls of Congress to federal prison is a tragedy of his own making,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen in a statement. \u201cJackson\u2019s political potential was unlimited, but he instead chose to treat his campaign account as a personal slush fund, stealing from the people who believed in him so he could live extravagantly. He squandered his great capacity for public service through outright theft. The prison sentence imposed today should serve as a wake-up call to other public officials who believe there are no consequences for betraying the public trust.\u201d \n \n Jackson\u2019s attorney Reid Weingarten had argued that Jackson\u2019s campaign spending included gray areas, like that of many congressman with \u201csafe\u201d seats. \n \n \u201cThis is not [Bernie] Madoff. This is not a Ponzi scheme. The courthouse is not ringed with victims demanding his head,\u201d Weingarten said. \u201cThe goddess of justice would not weep at an 18-month sentence.\u201d \n \n Later, Weingarten characterized it this way: \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy. The fall from grace was complete.\u201d \n \n For his part, Jackson Jr. shied away from cameras as he left court. But he predicted he had yet to write another chapter. \n \n \u201cI still believe in the power of redemption,\u201d Jesse Jackson Jr. said. \u201cToday I manned up and tried to accept responsibility for the errors of my ways, and I still believe in the resurrection.\u201d ||||| The wife of former Illinois congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. has been sentenced to one year in prison for filing false joint federal income tax returns that understated the income the couple received. \n \n Sandra Jackson admitted in a guilty plea earlier this year that from mid-2006 through mid-October of last year, she failed to report $600,000 in income that she and her husband earned from 2005 to 2011. \n \n Mrs. Jackson was a Chicago alderman before she resigned during a federal investigation of the couple. \n \n She was sentenced Wednesday along with her husband. Jesse Jackson Jr. was sentenced to two and a half years in prison after pleading guilty to engaging in a scheme to spend $750,000 in campaign funds on personal items. ||||| WASHINGTON \u2013 The end of the Jackson family political dynasty arrived Wednesday as a Chicago power couple ready-made for the cameras learned the next few years of their lives will be spent taking turns in prison. \n \n Former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., the civil rights leader's son who once dreamed of becoming mayor or senator, and his wife, former 7th Ward Ald. Sandi Jackson, were tripped up by a taste for luxury that was bankrolled with $750,000 from campaign funds. \n \n On their day of reckoning, the Jacksons brought up a host of personal struggles in an effort to inspire sympathy: his reported mental illness, her series of miscarriages, the plight of their two children if they lost their mother to prison. \n \n In the end, the former congressman got 30 months in federal prison and could end up serving about five months less if he behaves behind bars. The former alderman got a year and stands to serve it all. \n \n Jackson Jr. was given until at least Nov. 1 to begin his prison term. \n \n Federal Judge Amy Berman Jackson said supporters of the former congressman \u2014 including his own father \u2014 had urged her in letters to put him on probation. If she were to do so, she said, it would appear as if there were two systems of justice, \"one for the well-connected and one for everybody else.\" \n \n \"I cannot do it,\" she intoned. \"And I will not do it.\" \n \n She shot down the notion, brought up by the defense, that elected officials once considered campaign accounts to be retirement funds. \n \n While acknowledging the good the Jacksons had done in office, she lambasted Jackson Jr.'s misdeeds as \"knowing, organized, joint misconduct repeated and then covered up.\" \n \n She said Sandi Jackson was not a spouse who passively received the ill-gotten gains of crimes but one who knowingly spent thousands illegally on her personal whims. The judge noted that Sandi Jackson had served variously as campaign treasurer, campaign manager and consultant for the congressman. \n \n \"You were a key player in the Jesse Jackson campaign. Together, you were the campaign,\" the judge told Sandi Jackson. \n \n \"You are standing here to be sentenced because of your own significant and illegal conduct,\" the judge said. \n \n The Jacksons' sentences were lighter than prosecutors had recommended. They wanted four years for him and 18 months for her. Defense lawyers wanted him to serve 18 months. \n \n Sandi Jackson's lawyers did not get the probation they had sought for her, but they did get an order from the judge allowing her to remain free until her husband finishes serving his time. \n \n In another break, Jackson Jr. won't have to return $750,000 to his campaign fund, but must pay a $750,000 forfeiture as agreed when he pleaded guilty in February. \n \n Additionally, her plea deal called for her to pay $168,550, representing unpaid taxes, but the judge ordered her to pay only $22,000 in restitution. The sum represents money she misused from her own political accounts. \n \n The Jacksons cried as they addressed the judge separately before sentencing. \n \n \"I didn't separate my personal life from my political activities, and I couldn't have been more wrong,\" said Jackson Jr., who paused to dry his eyes and blow his nose. \n \n Jackson Jr. apologized for his crimes and expressed regrets to his mother and father. \n \n \"Your honor, throughout this process I've asked the government and the court to hold me and only me accountable for my actions,\" he said. \n \n He said he hoped that his wife could earn enough money in his absence to keep the family together. \"When I get back, I'll take on that burden,\" he said. \"By then I hope my children will be old enough that the pain I caused will be easier to bear.\" \n \n Sandi Jackson addressed the court after her husband. \"I am a little nervous,\" she told the judge, \"so I have a written statement that I would like to read to you.\" \n \n She continued: \"I want to begin by apologizing first to my family, to my friends, my community and my constituents for the actions that brought me here today.\" \n \n She said she had caused \"disappointment in my community\" and had \"put my family unit in peril.\" \n \n \"My heart breaks every day with the pain this has caused my babies,\" she continued, weeping. \"I ask to be parent, provider and support system that my babies will require in the difficult months ahead.\" \n \n Their children \u2014 a girl, 13, and a boy, 9 \u2014 were not in court. \n \n When the former alderman lost her bid for freedom, defense attorney Dan Webb said she wished to serve her term in a correctional institution in Marianna, Fla. The minimum-security facility is a prison camp about 65 miles northwest of Tallahassee. \n \n As for Jackson Jr., the judge said she would recommend he be placed in a federal prison camp in Alabama \u2014 he had stated that his first choice was one in Montgomery \u2014 or a prison in Butner, N.C. But the Bureau of Prisons will make the final call. \n \n Earlier in the hearing, Jackson Jr.'s lawyer, Reid Weingarten, said his client felt \"horror, shame and distress\" over his wrongs. \n \n But Weingarten also tried to downplay Jackson Jr.'s actions since he took money from his own campaign fund. It's not as if there are widows and orphans outside the courthouse who are victims and asking for his head, Weingarten said. \n \n \"This is not Madoff. This is not a Ponzi scheme,\" the lawyer said. Bernard Madoff, now imprisoned in the Butner facility, is a financier whose Ponzi scheme led investors to lose their fortunes. \n \n Weingarten said Jackson Jr. \"suffers from a very, very serious mental health disease.\" He identified the former congressman's illness as bipolar disorder and said it was relevant even though \"we didn't plead guilty by reason of insanity.\" \n \n Matt Graves, an assistant U.S. attorney, countered that Jackson Jr.'s crimes represented one of the largest cases of theft from a campaign treasury ever prosecuted. \n \n Graves took a shot at Jackson Jr.'s reported bipolar disorder, saying when mental health issues are litigated in court, usually there is expert testimony, discovery and an examination of the defendant \u2014 and that none had occurred in the case. \n \n \"When one looks at the facts,\" Graves said, \"it's quite clear that there's no there there.\" \n \n He decried Jackson Jr.'s \"wasted talent\" and \"what he threw away.\" \n \n Graves said Sandi Jackson's crimes were serious and had occurred over many years. He noted that defendants with children were given prison terms in courts across the country.",

Four people were killed, and nearly a dozen others were injured in a horrific scene on Burleson Retta Road in south Tarrant County. \n \n In deposition footage obtained by ABC's 20/20 as part of a recently-settled civil case against Couch, the now-18-year-old admits he recalls very little about the night police say he had a 0.24 BAC, triple the legal limit of those of age to drink. \n \n Ethan Couch (Photo: WFAA) \n \n \"Do you remember hitting the vehicle in the ditch?\" an attorney asked. \n \n \"No,\" Couch replied. \n \n \"Do you remember hitting the people standing there?\" the attorney continued. \n \n \"No,\" Couch replied. \n \n When asked if he exchanged text messages with his mom about drinking and driving that evening, Couch responded, \"She just sent me a text not to be out late, and not be out drinking and driving.\" \n \n Depositions from Ethan Couch and his family reveal for the first time what the family knew the night Ethan killed four people in a drunk driving crash and when they knew it. Todd Unger has more. \n \n In the testimony recorded in June, Couch drinks from a water bottle, answers questions directly, and has a goatee. The appearance stands in contrast to the youngish-looking teen that went to trial before Judge Jean Boyd in December of 2013, and was ultimately sentenced to probation and treatment, instead of jail. \n \n The recordings also include testimony from Ethan's parents, Fred and Tonya Couch, conducted late last year. \n \n During the criminal trial, Couch's psychologist testified that he was a victim of \"affluenza,\" because he was protected from his mistakes by his family's wealth. \n \n Tonya Couch (Photo: ABC News) \n \n In part of her testimony, Tonya Couch was asked directly by an attorney if she believes her son is an addict and has problems with alcohol. \n \n After lengthy pauses, and a sigh, she replied, \"Yes.\" \n \n In the video, Fred Couch said he didn't know his son was drinking heavily the night of the crash, but did acknowledge it had been an issue before that night. \n \n \"Did I know that Ethan had, on occasion, been drinking alcohol? I did know that,\" he said. \n \n Fred Couch (Photo: ABC News) \n \n The family has never spoken publicly about the case. Their civil attorney didn't respond to requests for comment. \n \n Last week, the Couch family settled the final lawsuit against them filed by the family of Lucas McConnell, a young teenager hurt in the crash. \n \n Couch was sentenced to ten years of probation and treatment as part of a sentence handed down by Judge Boyd. News 8 profiled the state hospital he lived at for months in 2014. \n \n On Friday night, 20/20 is airing an hour-long special about the Couch case directly before News 8 at 10. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://on.wfaa.com/1LwIiwS ||||| Never-before-seen deposition tapes reveal new details of how Texas teen Ethan Couch and his parents viewed his privileged upbringing that became the core of his defense in the so-called \u201cAffluenza\u201d DUI case. \n \n The deposition tapes, which were obtained by ABC News, are from a 2013 civil suit brought against Couch, his parents Tonya and Fred Couch, and the family\u2019s multimillion-dollar sheet metal company Cleburne Sheet Metal after the teenager killed four people and paralyzed another in a fatal DUI car accident on June 15, 2013. \n \n Couch and his parents did not testify at the criminal case that followed, so these tapes show the family talking about what happened in their own words for the first time under oath. \n \n During the deposition, Ethan Couch, who was 16 years old at the time of the accident, described a privileged life seemingly with few rules or consequences. He testified that he did drugs, that he thought his mother knew he drank alcohol and warned him not to drink and drive the night of the accident, that his parents allowed him to start driving by himself at age 13, and that he often stayed alone in the family\u2019s second home in Burleson, Texas. \n \n Tonya and Fred Couch admitted in the deposition that they allowed their son to stay without supervision in the Burleson home and to drive before he was of legal age, but denied knowing about his drinking habits. Fred Couch testified that \u201c[Ethan] seemed pretty responsible.\u201d \n \n When asked if she had ever disciplined Ethan for anything, Tonya Couch testified in the deposition that she would \u201csometimes ... take little things away from him or we would just discuss the problems.\u201d When asked if she could recall the last time she disciplined her son, Tonya replied, \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d \n \n On the night of June 15, 2013, Couch\u2019s blood alcohol level was three times the legal limit when he got behind the wheel of his father\u2019s red pick-up truck with seven other teens inside after a night of partying, authorities said. \n \n That night, Couch barreled down the road at approximately 70 miles an hour when he lost control of the truck, swerved into a ditch and plowed into a group of people who were helping a stranded motorist on the side of the road, killing four of them instantly, authorities said. \n \n When asked during the deposition if he remembered pulling out of the driveway, Ethan Couch said, \u201cNot really.\u201d The next thing he said he remembered was \u201cwaking up handcuffed to the hospital bed.\u201d \n \n Couch pleaded guilty to four counts of intoxication manslaughter and two counts of intoxication assault on Dec. 4, 2013. \n \n At the sentencing hearing, Couch\u2019s legal team called prominent psychologist Dr. G. Dick Miller to the stand to testify on Couch\u2019s behalf. Miller said that Couch\u2019s upbringing and a lack of consequences for his actions caused him to suffer from \u201cAffluenza.\u201d \n \n The prosecution advocated for Couch to receive a 20-year prison term, but instead he was sentenced to 10 years of probation and time in a rehab facility, a ruling that shocked the victims' families and made national headlines. \n \n Following the criminal case ruling, six families whose relatives were involved in the fatal accident brought civil suits against the Couches and the family\u2019s business. The Couches settled all of the suits without admitting any wrongdoing. \n \n \u201cNever once has Ethan apologized in any shape or form,\u201d said Eric Boyles, who lost his wife and daughter in the 2013 crash. \n \n Another family, the McConnells, whose son Lucas, now 15, was injured in the crash, was the last family to settle. At first, they fought to take the Couches to court, which is what led Ethan Couch, his parents, Ethan\u2019s friends and psychologist Dr. G. Dick Miller to be deposed. \n \n During his deposition, Miller said he had \u201cstrongly\u201d recommended in the criminal sentencing that Couch needed to be separated from his parents and that their parenting \u201cstrongly enabled\u201d the deadly accident. \n \n Fred Couch tried to distance himself from the \u201caffluenza\u201d defense during his deposition, testifying that, \u201cI don\u2019t even know that I believe affluenza is real.\u201d He denied that he and Tonya Couch were \u201cprofoundly dysfunctional\u201d parents and \u201cnever\u201d taught Ethan the rules didn\u2019t apply to him. \n \n Tonya Couch also testified that she \u201cnever saw the child drink.\u201d But Ethan\u2019s friend Starr Teague testified in the deposition that she had been drinking with Ethan in front of his mother at the family\u2019s Fort Worth home one week before the 2013 crash. \n \n Even on the night of the crash, Teague testified that Ethan had been texting with his mother and she \u201cknew that we were drinking, she was like, \ufffd?well just don\u2019t drink and drive.\u2019\u201d \n \n Just four months before the fatal crash, police had stopped a 15-year-old Couch at 1 a.m., who was drunk and relieving himself in a parking lot. Though he was alleged to be in clear violation of five different laws that night, Couch got away with a summons and was sent home with his mother Tonya Couch, according to one of the McConnells' attorneys, Todd Clement. \n \n During the deposition, Tonya Couch testified she didn\u2019t tell Fred Couch that their son had been drunk the night of the parking lot incident because she \u201cwasn\u2019t sure how he would react\u201d if he knew \u201cthe whole truth.\u201d \n \n As punishment for the summons, Fred Couch testified that he made Ethan walk to work for a month, but Ethan denied that ever happened. \u201cI don\u2019t remember ever having to walk to work,\u201d he said during the deposition. \n \n For that incident, Ethan was required to complete an alcohol awareness course and eight hours of community service within 90 days. But Tonya Couch testified in the deposition that her son never did the community service. \n \n When asked by Greg Coontz, one of the McConnells' attorneys, if she understood that Ethan would likely continue drinking and driving if there weren\u2019t consequences for his actions, Tonya Couch replied, \u201cI should have, yes.\u201d \n \n \u201cI should have known that,\u201d she continued. \u201cI really didn\u2019t think that that would happen again.\u201d \n \n When Ethan Couch was asked during the deposition if there was \u201calways alcohol\u201d at the Burleson house, he said, \u201cnot always,\u201d but \u201cmost of the time, yes.\u201d He admitted to there being drugs at the house and proceeded to list the number of drugs he had tried. \n \n \u201cI\u2019ve taken Valium, Hydrocodone, marijuana, cocaine, Xanax and I think I tried ecstasy once, pretty sure that was it,\u201d Couch testified. \n \n Nearly two and a half years since the June 2013 crash, Couch, who is now 18 years old and still on probation, is out of rehab and working at his father\u2019s business, Cleburne Sheet Metal. The Couches declined \u201c20/20\u2019s\u201d requests for comment for this report. \n \n The McConnells have settled their suit with the Couches but they and the other victims\u2019 families remain convinced that this accident was preventable. But over time, some hope to find forgiveness. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a daily decision to forgive,\u201d said Shaunna Jennings, whose husband was one of the people who had stopped to help the stranded motorist when he was killed. \u201c[Hate] doesn\u2019t do anything except punish you. ... I can\u2019t live my life bitter or angry.\u201d",

In newly released deposition footage, Ethan Couch says he believed his parents knew that he was a drinker and his mom had warned him not to drink and drive the night of the June, 2013 crash, ABC reports. \"I've taken Valium, Hydrocodone, marijuana, cocaine, Xanax, and I think I tried Ecstasy once,\" says Couch, who testified that he was often allowed to stay alone at the family's second home. Couch, who is now 18, was three times over the legal blood-alcohol limit for an adult when he crashed his father's pickup truck, and he says he doesn't even remember leaving the house. The newly released footage also includes video of Couch's parents talking about the boy's upbringing, WFAA reports. Both parents admitted that the teen had issues with alcohol and although his mother claimed he was sometimes punished, she couldn't recall the last time that happened, the New York Daily News reports. Months before the deadly crash, Couch received a summons for an incident that included drunk-driving allegations, and his mother says she \"should have\" realized that if he wasn't punished, he would probably end up drinking and driving again. The final crash lawsuit was settled last week and Couch is now out of rehab and working at his father's sheet-metal company, reports ABC. (Last year, Couch's father was charged with impersonating a police officer.)",

Says the men who wrote the bible. \n \n Not good pizza. I came for lunch. The pizza options were boring. Found the pizza to be uncooked \n \n I was on my way home from Fort Wayne, and was going through town. I like trying small town restaurants and I like meeting good people. This was a good stop. The pizza was great, the crust, sauce and Pepperoni tasted great. Super friendly staff. I couldn't figure out why so many bad reviews from California and 1st time posters until learning that this place has been under attack from the gay community. I brought those fake reviews to the attention of Yelp and they refuse to clean up this page like they have done for other businesses. Clearly this is unfair to this business. I cannot believe so much hate comes from a community that demands that hate not be directed towards them. I am disappointed that Yelp is biased on how they handled this. I will be back. \n \n This place closed up with out any kind of notice to the town. I guess after receiving over 800,00 dollars from people on a go fund me account when they posted they wouldn't serve there food for a gay wedding. They didn't need to work anymore. There pizza was not the best it use to be good but just seemed like they didn't care anymore. Really not sad that they left. \n \n We love to stop by here for pizza or ice cream. Everything is reasonably priced and the people working are very nice! We try to stop every time we pass through Walkerton. Unfortunately, it is permanently closed! \n \n Sad they had to close because of bigots threatening them, this is America and freedom of religion is still in the constitution, I'm glad believers stepped up and helped \n \n just the worst pizza you can imagine can't even imagine why people would want to eat this awful awful pizza sauce tasted like red dry ketchup from expired bottles having sat for years in a broom closet that is never cleaned. just disgusting. not upset it closed kinda happy actually \n \n I estimate the food, service and d\u00e9cor of Memories Pizza to be average. I suspect the vast majority of the poor ratings and comments are from people who dislike the fact Memories Pizza refused to cater a gay wedding. It wouldn't surprise me if the gay wedding situation was engineered by social justice warriors to cause trouble for this business. Who caters to a wedding from a pizza joint? \n \n Visited Indiana, Horrible pizza. Dough is dry, pizza sauce taste like spoiled ketchup and topping remind me of rotten beef jerky. I would not serve this to my worst enemy. Maybe someone on deathrow is worthy of this as their last meal...if they are truly guilty:) SAVE YOUR COIN \n \n Like most of the 1 start reviews, I have never been to this establishment. I did find, however, both the service and food to be excellent. Highly recommended. \n \n Good people. The service was lovely and the workers were all very sweet. Their pizza is great and I can't wait to come back to Indiana to maybe visit this place again. \n \n You \"godless\" immoral dogs.... who seek to destroy Christ followers.... Christ,.. the very embodiment of God Almighty, made manifest in the flesh... came to redeem sinners. Was crucified, died, buried, and resurrected! .. for the purpose of correction of your \"fallen\" - \"contrary to God\" souls.... God incinerated Sodom and Gomorah for their homosexual ways (the perversion of God's creations)... ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ You're all so smart in your own mind... but God's ways are not the fallen man's ways... GOD WILL NOT BE MOCKED!... Your doom is coming.. the moment you die... and shortly thereafter YOUR JUDGEMENT by the perfect God administered through His Son Jeshua. My Savior, Jeshua,.. is perfect... And these times, while the devil and all that belong to him, think they are making gains, are in fact digging themselves DEEPER IN THE HOLE OF ETERNAL DAMNATION! May the Living God richly bless that little family for taking their correct stand for God... which is evident as of this writing ($600,000 plus in donations through GO FUND ME)... The Lord holds the universe together with His WORD of TRUTH... He can certainly take care of that family through the rest of His children.. and those who are not yet saved but know right from wrong.... You wicked, evil, homosexuals... you haters of God and His TRUTH. Most all of you are miserable, and continue to feed your lustful fires that you just can't seem to put out... and soon are going to rant and rail against God when society falls under the coming Antichrist.... YOU DOGS!, .. you less than worthless things. You have been seared with reprobate minds.... with no way back. No wonder you act the way you do... Your of your father the devil himself !!!!! You prompt others to do your dirty work.. and would like to see this family's business burned.... HA! Wait until you see what the Living God has in store for you.... a special place reserved in the LAKE OF FIRE with eternal suffering...!!! Ahhh, Yessss.... My Savior is perfect and WILL meet out YOUR proper JUDGEMENT! \n \n This place is Americana. A small town mom and pop operation that is very welcoming. Nothing against chains but they can't duplicate what the independents can. The pizza was very tasty. Loved the cheese and crispy crust. I'll be back next chance I get. \n \n I was at this really fun pizza place in November when I was visiting family and it did not disappoint. The pizza was very good, but the people who worked there made it a great time out. \n \n The cheese garlic bread and our pizza was awesome! Nice, super friendly staff! Fun to look at the throwback memorabilia on the walls & had fun playing games they had out with our kids. Fun night! \n \n When I was in the Walkerton, Indiana area I stopped by Memories Pizza. This is before the incident where they were setup by the TV Station in South Bend. All I can say is that the pizza I ordered was very well made and the service was excellent. And to be quite honest that is the only thing I was concerned about. And for the record I am a retired U.S. Marine, former business owner and Christian. The food and service was very good. I thought that was the main purpose of Yelp to let people know about the quality of food and the quality of the service. \n \n Traveling for work IN and decided to see what all this fuss was about. Pizza: it was greasy, doughy, and by far the worst I've had-akin to a generic frozen supermarket pizza. We also ordered a chicken Parmesan sandwich. Firstly, it was burned, the chicken left us wondering if there was actually any chicken in between the greasy breading. There are better choices in the area which are serving palatable food. Stay away from here. \n \n Nasty! Visiting with friends in the area, they hadn't eaten there and we thought it might be good food. The service was slow, and they weren't that busy. But worst of all was the food. We all were ill afterwards. Stay away is what we say. \n \n Came back since I'm in South Bend on business. Weird vibe, pizza was greasy but not as bad as first time but still not good. Oddly enough the best thing here was the bread sticks which is odd as last time the pizza dough was deplorable. Today it was edible, but the pizza was so greasy we tossed most of it. If you only judge this place by the quality of their flagship product (pizza) the only fair rating is one star. I will not be returning here in the future. China House will get my business or Subway if I'm in a rush. ||||| RFRA: Michiana business wouldn't cater a gay wedding Posted: Tuesday, March 31, 2015 10:40 PM EDT Updated: Wednesday, April 1, 2015 7:37 AM EDT Posted:Updated: \n \n A small-town pizza shop is saying they agree with Governor Pence and the signing of the controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act. \n \n \n \n The O'Connor family, who owns Memories Pizza, says they have a right to believe in their religion and protect those ideals. \n \n \n \n \u201cIf a gay couple came in and wanted us to provide pizzas for their wedding, we would have to say no,\u201d says Crystal O'Connor of Memories Pizza. \n \n \n \n She and her family are standing firm in their beliefs. \n \n \n \n The O'Connors have owned Memories Pizza in Walkerton for 9 years. \n \n \n \n It's a small-town business, with small-town ideals. \n \n \n \n \u201cWe are a Christian establishment,\u201d says O'Connor. \n \n \n \n The O'Connor family prides themselves in owning a business that reflects their religious beliefs. \n \n \n \n \u201cWe're not discriminating against anyone, that's just our belief and anyone has the right to believe in anything,\u201d says O'Connor. \n \n \n \n So, when Governor Pence signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act into law, the family was not disappointed. \n \n \n \n \u201cWe definitely agree with the bill,\u201d says O'Connor. \n \n \n \n When ABC 57 asked O'Connor about the negative backlash the bill has been getting for being a discriminatory piece of legislation, she says that's simply not true. \n \n \n \n \u201cI do not think it's targeting gays.

The 2007-2009 recession, already in the record books as the worst in the 66 years since the end... (Associated Press) \n \n From the start of the recession at the end of 2007 to the end in June of 2009, the U.S. economy shrank 5.1 percent. That is 1 percentage point worse than the previous estimate that the recession reduced total output during that period by 4.1 percent. \n \n The new estimates emerged from the annual revision of economic data prepared by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis and released Friday. \n \n Among the previous 10 postwar recessions, output in only two dropped by more 3 percent. In the 1957-58 recession, the economy contracted 3.7 percent. And during the 1973-1975 downturn, the economy fell 3.2 percent from the start of the recession to the end. \n \n The government attributed the bigger declines in output in part to weaker consumer spending and business investment than previously estimated. \n \n By year, the government's new figures show that the economy took a much bigger hit in 2009, when output shrank 3.5 percent. The previous estimate had shown a decline of 2.5 percent that year. \n \n In 2008, the new estimate shows the economy contracted by 0.3 percent. The previous estimate had indicated that output was unchanged for that year compared with 2007. \n \n The last recession began in December 2007 and lasted until June 2009. Though the economy has been growing since then, growth has been subpar. And the unemployment rate has remained elevated; it's now 9.2 percent. \n \n The revisions showed that growth in 2010 was a bit stronger than previously estimated. They put growth for all of 2010 at 3 percent, up from a previous estimate that the economy grew 2.9 percent last year. \n \n The revisions to the country's gross domestic product, the total output of goods and services, used more complete data for such items as consumer and business spending. \n \n The government's annual revisions are released each July, along with its first estimate of growth for the April-June quarter of the current year.",

And yes, the economy is now growing\u2014but it expanded only 1.3% from April to June, the Commerce Department said, lower than expected. Officials also revised the growth figure for the first three months of the year to 0.4%, compared to an earlier estimate of 1.9%. That means that the past 6 months have seen the least growth since the end of the recession. Among the reasons: Gas prices, less consumer spending, and smaller government, notes the Atlantic.

More not-exactly-heart-wrenching comments: \"This was a banal accident in which there was a breakdown in the interaction between human beings ... It was as though there was a blackout in everyone's heads and in the instruments.\" The BBC notes that he did get choked up at one point, though: When asked about the 5-year-old who was among the more than 30 who died, he was unable to speak.

The administrator had found the memorabilia in the company's storage. \n \n Police confiscated the items from the auctioneers two weeks later, and on Monday arrested a suspect and raided his Berlin home and cars. They said another suspect, who is living in Turkey, is currently \"not available,\" but they would try to get him extradited to Germany. \n \n During their investigation, police officers and prosecutors also flew to New York, where they met Ono to have her verify the stolen goods' authenticity. \n \n \"She was very emotional and we noticed clearly how much these things mean to her and how happy she would be to have them back,\" prosecutor Susann Wettley said of the moment they showed Ono some of the recovered items and pictures of some others. \n \n Wettley said that Ono's former driver, who is now living in Turkey, is one of the suspects. He has a previous conviction in New York related to the stolen items, she said. \n \n The other suspect, who was arrested in Berlin on Monday, was identified as a 58-year-old German businessman of Turkish origin. During the search of his car, police said they found additional belongings of Lennon in a briefcase hidden under the spare tire in the trunk. Neither suspect's name was released because of German privacy rules. \n \n Police are still checking confiscated computer files and business contracts to better understand how exactly the stolen goods ended up at the auction house in Berlin and if the auctioneers were aware that they bought stolen goods from the two suspects. They said the items have been in possession of Auctionata since 2014, but were never available for sale online. \n \n The trove of Lennon memorabilia also includes a recording of a Beatles concert from 1965, a school exercise book from 1952, contract documents for the copyright of Lennon's \"I'm the Greatest\" song and handwritten scores for \"Woman\" and \"Just like starting over.\" \n \n There are also three of Lennon's leather-bound diaries, from 1975, 1979 and 1980. The last entry was made by Lennon on the morning of Dec. 8, 1980, a few hours before he was killed, Wettley said. \n \n It included a note on the famous photo shoot by Annie Leibovitz that same day showing a naked Lennon embracing his wife. \n \n It wasn't immediately clear when Ono will get all the items back.",

    "document": "The developing agreement on the DNA database would be part of a series of pacts that would resolve many of the key outstanding issues in the legislative session this year, including the state\u2019s budget for the next year, new political districts for state legislators and a new pension plan that would reduce retirement benefits for future public employees. \n \n \u201cWe have the parameters of a deal,\u201d Assemblyman Joseph R. Lentol, a Democrat from Brooklyn , said of the DNA bill that he is sponsoring. \n \n Negotiations are moving at an unusually brisk pace in the capital, as Mr. Cuomo and lawmakers face two sets of deadlines: a federal court has demanded an update on the Legislature\u2019s redistricting progress by Thursday, and the governor and legislators are required by law to have a new budget in place by April 1. \n \n New York\u2019s DNA database was created in the mid-1990s but applied only to those convicted of a limited number of crimes; the data collection has been expanded three times since then by the Legislature, most recently in 2006. Currently, DNA samples can be collected from people convicted of fewer than half of the crimes codified in state law, including all felonies and some misdemeanors. The measure would expand that to require that a DNA sample be submitted by all convicted criminals. \n \n The Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr. , an advocate for expanding the database, wrote in a recent opinion article that taking DNA samples from those convicted of low-level crimes had proved to be effective. He said that since the state allowed prosecutors to collect DNA from individuals convicted of petty larceny, investigators had been able to identify people linked to 48 murders and 220 sexual assaults statewide. \n \n In one case prosecuted by Mr. Vance\u2019s office, DNA from the butt of a cigarette smoked by Lerio Guerrero while he was being questioned for trespassing in Brooklyn last year linked him to a 1998 rape. Mr. Guerrero had been arrested several times in the interim, but none of his convictions were for crimes serious enough to warrant that he give a DNA sample. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But the defense bar has argued that courts sometimes place onerous restrictions on gaining access to evidence after a conviction and has, therefore, urged the Legislature to make it easier for defense lawyers to get evidence and run tests against the database. \n \n \u201cNew York has a demonstrated problem with eyewitness misidentification and false confessions leading to wrongful convictions,\u201d said Stephen Saloom, the policy director of the Innocence Project. \u201cAny legislation that ignores the recommendations of those who\u2019ve studied these issues is ignoring the heart of wrongful conviction reform needed in New York State .\u201d \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver , a Manhattan Democrat, has pushed to allow defendants access to the database. \u201cWe need to see fairness in terms of discovery, in terms of a defendant or a, quote-unquote, wrongfully convicted person,\u201d he said. \n \n The Senate majority leader, Dean G. Skelos , a Long Island Republican, said he was not opposed to access provisions, as long as it was \u201cdone in a very tight and controlled way.\u201d Senator Skelos did say he was against including broader so-called wrongful conviction protections in the bill, like videotaping interrogations. \n \n Some in the Assembly, led by Hakeem Jeffries of Brooklyn, have been pushing to include as part of the DNA bill a measure that would make it a violation, rather than a crime, to possess very small amounts of marijuana in public view, but it was not clear whether that provision would make it into the final language. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no justification for expanding the database and simultaneously including illegitimate misdemeanor marijuana arrest convictions that are racially biased and fatally flawed,\u201d he said. \n \n The discussions over the DNA database are running alongside quickening budget negotiations. As part of his spending plan, the governor is proposing to give newly hired public workers across the state, including in New York City , the choice between a less generous pension plan than is available to current employees or a defined contribution plan, which is similar to a 401(k). \n \n But the senior administration official said the governor was now prepared to drop the 401(k) option, which has been a lightning rod for criticism from labor unions, so long as legislative leaders agreed to his proposal to create a new pension tier that would provide reduced retirement benefits for future workers. ||||| Bennett Barbour was convicted in 1978 of a rape he didn\u2019t commit. At trial, he had an alibi supported by several witnesses. He didn\u2019t match the victim\u2019s description of her attacker. Barbour suffers from a severe bone disease that would have made it nearly impossible for him to be the assailant. Police found no physical evidence connecting him to the crime, beyond the eyewitness identification by his alleged victim. Barbour was handed an 18-year sentence and paroled after nearly five years. \n \n He tells me his time in prison was \u201ca nightmare.\u201d He has cancer now, \u201call over my body,\u201d and travels regularly to Richmond for treatment. In prison, he says, \u201ceverything is taken away. Your pride ...\u201d as his voice trails off. Jonathan Sheldon, a lawyer familiar with his case says, \u201cPeople think, \u2018Oh, he only got five years.\u2019 But in that five years he lost his six-month-old marriage, and scarred his relationship with his daughter. That five years broke him.\u201d \n \n The Commonwealth of Virginia learned that Bennett Barbour was innocent nearly two years ago, when DNA testing cleared him of the crime. Virginia authorities, however, never informed Barbour of his innocence. (State officials claim to have mailed a letter with the test results to Barbour\u2019s last four known addresses, but none of those letters ever reached him.) Barbour learned of the DNA tests that proved his innocence only last month, on Feb. 5, when he received a phone call from Sheldon. \u201cI was with my nephew playing cards, and Mr. Sheldon called my mother\u2019s house looking for me,\u201d says Barbour. \u201cHe said the authorities stopped looking for me because they couldn\u2019t find me. But Sheldon found me in two days using the Internet.\u201d \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n Actually, that\u2019s not true. It only took Sheldon a few hours. \n \n Dahlia Lithwick Dahlia Lithwick writes about the courts and the law for Slate and hosts the podcast Amicus. \n \n \n \n Bennett Barbour is one of the fortunate ones. He, unlike what may ultimately amount to dozens of other men wrongly convicted and incarcerated by the state of Virginia, knows that his innocence can be conclusively proved. His lawyers at the University of Virginia\u2019s Innocence Project filed paperwork last week to have the state formally declare him innocent. The trouble is that Barbour is one of only a handful who have enjoyed this vindication. Years ago, Virginia authorities realized they were likely convicting innocent men. The state\u2019s officials know their criminal justice system is riddled with errors. As they investigated the depth of the problem, they have found that indeed many more men\u2014at least dozens, maybe more\u2014might be exonerated using DNA tests. But the state\u2019s authorities did not move quickly to suspend these sentences or contact the individuals or families involved. They did not publicize their findings. Indeed, they denied Freedom of Information Act requests that would have shed light on the problem. Rather, Virginia state officials appears to have devised a system of notifying current and former convicts that is almost guaranteed to lead to the fewest number of exonerations. \n \n How was it that Bennett Barbour\u2019s DNA came to be tested several decades after the alleged rape? In September 2004, Mark Warner, then Virginia\u2019s governor, ordered a random audit of 31 old criminal cases after a vast trove of biological evidence was discovered lying around in old case files saved by state forensic serologists. The testing of those 31 samples led to the exonerations of two convicted rapists. Warner, embarrassed by the revelations, then ordered in late 2005 that every sample obtained between 1973 and 1988 be rechecked. It amounted to thousands of files. \n \n It was a project intended to take 18 months at a cost of $1.4 million dollars. Now in its seventh year, the cost of the project hovers at $5 million. Nobody has any idea exactly how the Virginia Department of Forensics has conducted its work. Indeed, no one knows much about the specifics of the crime lab\u2019s work at all. According to the Richmond Times Dispatch, the state located approximately 800 biological samples of DNA that could be tested. Of those, only 214 were in sufficient condition to yield accurate results. Among these, more than 70 people\u2014one commonly cited figure is 79\u2014appear to have been excluded as the perpetrators of a crime. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n University of Virginia law school professor Brandon Garrett (who has contributed to Slate) is an expert on wrongful convictions and DNA exoneration. His landmark study, Convicting the Innocent, scrutinized the cases of the first 250 people to be exonerated nation-wide by DNA testing. To hear him tell it, Virginia\u2019s statewide audit is a mystery wrapped in obfuscation. \u201cThis DNA testing program began two Governors ago,\u201d he says, \u201cbut its operation has remained shrouded in secrecy. We do not know how the authorities chose to test the cases that they have tested. We do not know how long the authorities have known about the many dozens of cases where DNA has excluded the individuals. We do not know what local prosecutors plan to do about the cases where DNA may prove innocence.\u201d \n \n At the time Virginia\u2019s audit began, Barry Scheck, co-founder of the Innocence Project, which has used DNA testing to exonerate hundreds of prisoners across the country, noted in astonishment that \u201ca random sample of convicted felons and we're getting a 7 percent exoneration rate\" in Virginia. But it appears that a 7 percent exoneration rate may be grossly understating the problem. UVA\u2019s Garrett suspects that the error rate may actually be as high as 17 percent. As he discovered in his own research, Barbour\u2019s conviction, based on the testimony of a single eyewitness, reflects the reality that of the first 250 people exonerated by DNA testing, a whopping 76 percent were misidentified by eyewitnesses. \n \n Whatever the percentage of error on the part of Virginia\u2019s criminal justice system, one thing is certain: Only a handful of the falsely convicted have received the exonerations they deserve. Since DNA retesting began in Virginia, two people have been formally exonerated and another, who is dead, was cleared of a rape he didn\u2019t commit. When Barbour\u2019s paperwork is processed, he will be only the fourth person to be exonerated, despite the fact that the state is aware of scores of others who may be innocent. Even now Barbour remains skeptical. \u201cThey can do anything now to trick it up like they did 34 years ago,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be excited \u2019til it all comes out. I\u2019m innocent. I\u2019m here. But I don\u2019t trust the justice system. Period.\u201d \n \n After all, Virginia authorities never did successfully contact Barbour to acknowledge his innocence. It was Jonathan Sheldon, a private-practice attorney in Fairfax, Va. who took it upon himself to contact Barbour and many of the other 70-some men who have been convicted of crimes, excluded by DNA testing, and never advised of that fact. As of today, the state has given him only 32 names and Sheldon says he has already located most of them. Some are dead. Some are dying. Some suffer from mental illnesses that make it impossible for them to even understand why he is calling. As the Richmond-Times Dispatch\u2019s Frank Green, who first reported on Barbour\u2019s exclusion by DNA testing, wrote last month: \u201cThe Virginia Department of Forensic Science has issued reports that exclude at least 76 felons as the source of biological evidence in their cases.\u201d Yet as of last month, 29 of those felons had not been notified that the new DNA reports existed. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n Sheldon launched this crusade to notify as many innocent men as possible because, in his view, neither Virginia\u2019s crime lab nor its prosecutors\u2019 office is taking that task seriously. How the Commonwealth of Virginia managed to put the crime lab and prosecutors\u2019 office in charge of retesting DNA and notifying the prosecutors of the state\u2019s own errors is one of the mysteries here. It would appear to be a program destined to end in confusion, obstruction, or worse. And it has. \n \n I spoke to Pete Marone, director of the Virginia Department of Forensic Science. Marone argues that the state\u2019s crime lab should not be making legal determinations about the meaning of these DNA tests. \u201cAt what point does the lab\u2019s responsibility end?\u201d he asks. \u201cWe\u2019re a lab. We do analysis. We don\u2019t determine what the meaning is.\u201d He says that the crime lab\u2019s policy is to turn over their results to the police department and prosecutors, who are in a better position \u201cto ascribe value to those numbers.\u201d \n \n Initially, Virginia\u2019s state authorities had no plans to notify the convicts that their DNA was being tested. Then, in 2008, the state legislature ordered them to notify those same convicts that their samples had been found and might be examined. If a convict failed to return the paperwork, the sample was tested nonetheless. Despite Marone\u2019s claim that the Department of Forensic Science only conducts lab work, it alone is responsible for informing state prosecutors and police that former convicts have been cleared by DNA tests. \n \n The department put out a call to pro bono lawyers around the state, who were asked to hand-deliver notifications that the accused might now be subject to DNA retesting. But there was a condition: Those lawyers were required to sign confidentiality agreements indicating that they were barred from explaining the content of the letters to the accused or from representing them in court. Marone explains the rationale for constraining these volunteer lawyers: \u201cThe General Assembly said to send pro bono attorneys,\u201d he says. \u201cThey can\u2019t go blabbing all over the place. They can\u2019t have the person they are notifying be their client.\u201d He adds that this was done, in part, to protect the pro bono lawyers: \u201cIf you send a young, new attorney to a bad neighborhood, bad things could happen.\u201d \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n The letters themselves were mainly legal jargon, and most of the recipients had no idea why the state was contacting them. Here is a copy of one of the state\u2019s notification letters: \n \n According to Deirdre Enright of the Innocence Project at the University of Virginia Law School (and one of Barbour\u2019s lawyers), most of the recipients were simply terrified that the commonwealth was re-examining their alleged crimes at all. The volunteer lawyers who delivered these letters were reduced, more or less, to being carrier pigeons, unable to explain the crucial significance of these letters\u2019 content for the lives of these men and their families. The net effect was simply to frighten most of the convicts who received them, who knew only that the justice system was spontaneously taking another look at them decades later. \n \n Marone sees it differently. \u201cThis is the criminal justice system,\u201d he says. \u201cThe answer is not to release all the criminal records to the newspapers. Lots of these folks hear about the testing and say \u2018I did my time. I\u2019ll tell you what to do with your report.\u2019 We couldn\u2019t go searching the streets for people.\u201d \n \n The lawyers at the UVA Innocence Project believe that\u2019s wrongheaded. Those who have been convicted of a crime they did not commit want to know that they could now be proven innocent. They also quickly realized that the worst possible agency to be notifying individuals\u2014the prosecutors and state crime lab\u2014had taken the sole authority to help them. Matthew Engle, legal director of the Innocence Project Clinic, tells me that those agencies are \u201cnot in the business of exonerating people, they\u2019re in the business of convicting people.\u201d \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n Enter Jonathan Sheldon. A successful Northern Virginia attorney, Sheldon has long been involved in death row cases and has worked for years to try to end the death penalty in the commonwealth. Indeed, he was one of the lawyers for John Allen Muhammad, the D.C. sniper. As he learned of the pro bono lawyers fanning out across the state, Sheldon grew infuriated that Virginia was unwilling to release the names of the more than 70 people who DNA testing suggested were innocent. \u201cWhy ask for volunteer lawyers to find people and tell them about DNA testing that might be meaningless?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhy was the state trying to eliminate all these lawyers from representing all these people?\u201d \n \n Sheldon submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request and investigated further. He looked at the sample letter being mailed out. \u201cThese are not well-educated people,\u201d he says, of most of the accused. \u201cI thought, \u2018If you send that letter to someone they are going to think the government is after them again.\u2019 \u201d Sheldon also realized that despite all the testing going on, it appeared that not a single prosecutor had notified anyone that they had been found innocent. \u201cAt some point,\u201d he says, \u201cwe were poking and prodding them and filing FOIA requests and they just broke and offered to winnow out the 70-something names that had been excluded.\u201d As with the pro bono lawyers before him, state authorities made Sheldon promise not to help those who could be exonerated sue the Department of Forensic Science or take any action on their behalf. Instead, beginning in January, he began making what he calls \u201coblique\u201d phone calls to men who couldn\u2019t always understand what he was trying to tell them about the state, their DNA, and the justice system. \n \n And so, while the commonwealth was unable to track down Bennett Barbour for two years, Sheldon did it in a few hours. (Barbour\u2019s lawyer Deirdre Enright says she was able to find Barbour\u2019s correct address in an hour using WhitePages.com.) Nate Green, the Williamsburg Commonwealth's Attorney, told the Richmond Times Dispatch that when he received the 2010 report in Barbour\u2019s case, he sent letters out to the four addresses Barbour had occupied over the last 15 years and received no response. Sheldon says Green \u201cis a good guy and meant well,\u201d but you can\u2019t hand a lab report to the police and tell them to go find a guy. \u201cIt\u2019s just not his job to go find old cases and it\u2019s not the police\u2019s job,\u201d he says. Sheldon made it his job. \n \n In yet another case that recently emerged, the family of a deceased man seeking information on his DNA test results learned that their letter had been misplaced as well. When Sheldon asked the Virginia crime lab for those records, he was told that the department had \u201cnot, as part of the project's process, intentionally sent notification letters or certificates of analysis to family members of deceased suspects.\u201d In other words, DNA tests that could potentially exclude deceased offenders may not be released at all. Marone claims the forensics department called the prosecutors immediately in this instance, but the \u201cpaperwork was put aside.\u201d He cautions that critics of the system should \u201ckeep in mind that until last year, we weren\u2019t allowed to give those reports to anyone but a law enforcement agency. That information is private and personal, and maybe that individual doesn\u2019t want his family members to have a copy of the report. We have to protect the sensitivity and privacy of those individuals.\u201d \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n Marone acknowledges that the system is \u201cnot perfect and it\u2019s not timely.\u201d But he rejects the idea that anyone is to blame. Marone claims the crime lab is doing its job, albeit slowly, and that it is the responsibility of the prosecutors and police to notify those who have been excluded by the testing. Sheldon, for his part, rejects the idea that the forensics lab is merely a passive, impartial observer. \u201c[The Department of Forensic Science] thinks of themselves as this holy, unbiased, scientific branch of government,\u201d he says. \u201cBut they are an organization with political sensibilities that are strongly pro-prosecution. That\u2019s not surprising since prosecutors and the police are its main constituents.\u201d \n \n It\u2019s hard to tell whether all this represents mere incompetence on the part of the commonwealth, or some more pernicious effort to cover up past error, intimidate potential exonerees, and disqualify dozens of pro bono attorneys who likely could have represented them. The fact that vitally important information seems to fall into a black hole between the forensics lab, the prosecutors\u2019 offices, and the convicts and their lawyers, suggests that intentional or not, the net effect is that injustices are not being brought to light. \n \n It remains to be seen whether there will be any repercussions for the state for its failure to notify what may be dozens of men that they were imprisoned for crimes they didn\u2019t commit. The editorial board of the Richmond Times Dispatch recently advocated \u201cmaking prosecutors and police chiefs personally liable for the failure to inform innocent men in a timely manner of evidence exonerating them.\u201d Sheldon says that it may certainly be the case that someone will have a claim against the state as these convicts learn of Virginia\u2019s errors and delays, particularly if someone is still in prison and has not been notified. At the very least, there is a strong push from Innocence Project branches and defense lawyers around the state to allow someone other than Department of Forensic Science and the prosecutors\u2019 offices to take responsibility for notifications. \n \n Sheldon did learn recently that the forensics department may be taking action of a different sort. According to someone at the Mid-Atlantic Innocence Project, the crime lab initiated an inquiry into whether Sheldon breached his confidentiality agreement because of the press coverage of Barbour's story. Marone denies that this is so.",

    "document": "Travellers can enjoy a deeper, more restful sleep with a new high-tech weighted blanket designed to reduce stress and anxiety by simulating the sensation of being hugged, its designer claims. \n \n Applying the principles of \u201cdeep pressure touch stimulation\u201d therapy, the Gravity blanket is made with \"high density plastic poly pellets\" designed to relax your nervous system by targeting pressure points on the body linked to improved sleep, mood and relaxation, creating the feeling of being held, similar to how a parent might \u201cswaddle an infant\u201d to sleep. \n \n The process is said to increase serotonin and melatonin levels while decreasing cortisol levels, which reduces your heart rate and blood pressure, while the minimised body movement from increased relaxation promotes a deeper REM (rapid eye movement) sleep cycle, which is the period when your brain and body are being recharged. \n \n The duvet is meant to be between seven and 12 per cent of the user\u2019s weight Credit: Kickstarter \n \n Offered in three weight sizes - 15 lbs (6.8kg), 20 lbs (9kg) and 25 lbs (11.3kg) - the duvet is meant to be between seven and 12 per cent of the user\u2019s weight. With a soft fleece cover and a cotton inner shell, Gravity has been made with durable, washable and breathable materials that keep you from becoming too hot under it. \n \n \u201cThe science behind Gravity reveals that it can be used to treat a variety of ailments, including insomnia, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, as well as circumstantial stress and prolonged anxiety,\u201d its Brooklyn-based designer, John Fiorentino, claims on Kickstarter, the crowdfunding website where the design was recently launched. \n \n Previous research has suggested that weighted blankets could have positive effects on sleep. A study in 2015 published in the Journal of Sleep Medicine and Disorders reported that \u201cweighted blankets and vets can provide a beneficial calming effect, especially in clinical disorders\u201d and \u201cmay aid in reducing insomnia through altered tactile input\u201d. \n \n Research from 2008 in Occupational Therapy in Mental Health also suggested that the use of weighted blankets was effective for those who suffer from anxiety. \n \n Back in 1992, a study by Temple Grandin PhD found that: \u201cDeep pressure touch has been found to have beneficial effects in a variety of clinical settings. Occupational therapists have observed that a very light touch alerts the nervous system, but deep pressure is relaxing and calming.\u201d \n \n Priced from $169, Gravity is expected to be available for delivery this autumn in September and October. \n \n Gravity isn\u2019t the only bizarre blanket made available for travellers recently. Snuggling up under a duvet could be as easy as putting on a jacket or pair of trousers with \"duvet suits\" - extra-padded pyjamas - that come with a detachable hood and double up as a pillow squished inside its carry bag. They are three times warmer than a fleece blanket or a jumper, it is claimed. \n \n These \"duvet suits\" are said to be warmer than a fleece blanket or a jumper \n \n The Slanket, meanwhile, is a 60\" x 95\" fleece blanket with sleeves, lets you disappear under a warm cover without sacrificing the mobility of your arms, allowing you to eat, drink, read or use your hands for other tasks while keeping your body warm. It comes in a couple of styles including one with a built-in pocket for your feet to keep your toes toasty and the Double Slanket which has two pairs of sleeves, to keep both you and another person cosy under a shared blanket. \n \n The Slanket \n \n \n \n \n \n ||||| The \u2018Gravity blanket\u2019 raised $3 million online with a claim to treat anxiety. Then that promise was deleted \n \n A \n \n \u201cGravity blanket\u201d on Kickstarter that claimed to use cozy pressure to treat anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and other conditions has been taking the internet by storm, raising more than $3 million. But on Thursday, the company quietly deleted the bold medical claims on its crowdfunding site \u2014 language that violated Kickstarter policy and went against FDA recommendations \u2014 after STAT inquired about its promotional statements. \n \n The creators of Gravity call their product a \u201cpremium-grade, therapeutic weighted blanket\u201d intended to treat psychiatric illnesses. People quickly snuggled up to the idea: More than 15,000 donors contributed to the Kickstarter campaign to help get the blanket to the market, where it\u2019s projected to sell for as much as $279. \n \n A slew of publications have touted the product with headlines such as, \u201cI Want This Anti-Anxiety Blanket and You Will Too.\u201d But the science behind the blanket\u2019s claims is scarce\u2014 as STAT found by reviewing the studies the manufacturer cites as evidence for its claims. \n \n advertisement \n \n The Kickstarter campaign made big promises: \u201cThe science behind Gravity reveals that it can be used to treat a variety of ailments, including insomnia, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, as well as circumstantial stress and prolonged anxiety.\u201d \n \n But on Thursday afternoon, that language was swapped to say the blanket could be \u201cused\u201d for those conditions, rather than treat them. Then, the section disappeared entirely. The makers haven\u2019t posted an update about the changes for their buyers. \n \n The blanket\u2019s creators didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. After STAT inquired about the campaign with Kickstarter, the site said it asked the Gravity team to change the language because it wasn\u2019t in line with their rules on health claims. \n \n A screen capture of the Gravity Kickstarter page before the language was changed. \n \n Gravity isn\u2019t the type of product regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. However, FDA recommendations released in July 2016 laid out clear guidelines for promoting wellness products, which are low-risk items designed to support a healthy lifestyle. \n \n They can be marketed as supporting people who live with anxiety. They shouldn\u2019t claim that a product can treat an anxiety disorder. \n \n The marketing language also appeared to violate Kickstarter\u2019s rules. The crowdfunding site prohibits campaigns for \u201cany item claiming to cure, treat, or prevent an illness or condition.\u201d Kickstarter has previously said that the rule was developed out of concern that medical claims could have \u201charmful consequences\u201d for consumers. \n \n Regardless of how it\u2019s promoted, the evidence behind the product is scarce. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s not a miracle therapy,\u201d said Dr. Khalid Ismail, a sleep medicine researcher at Tufts Medical Center in Boston. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s ready for prime time yet.\u201d \n \n Weighted blankets simulate the feeling of a big hug. The creators say it\u2019s similar to swaddling a newborn baby, but with a much higher price tag. They claim that the increased weight \u2014 also known as deep touch pressure stimulation \u2014 can increase serotonin and melatonin levels while driving down cortisol, a stress hormone, \u201call without filling a prescription.\u201d \n \n It\u2019s not a novel concept: Weighted blankets have been used in children with autism and elderly individuals with dementia. You can even buy them with a lower price tag from home goods stores. \n \n \u201cWhat\u2019s new is that they\u2019re trying to broaden the indication for its use,\u201d said Ismail. \n \n But the research they cite falls short of the hype. \n \n One study looked at the use of weighted blankets, among other products, in a \u201csensory room\u201d in an inpatient psychiatric unit. The researchers studied 75 people who used that room and concluded that those who tried the blanket reported a decrease in their anxiety and distress. But there was also a decrease in those symptoms among people who didn\u2019t get under the blanket. And the study wasn\u2019t blinded, so people might\u2019ve reported positive effects because they were led to expect the blanket would have a positive effect. \n \n Another study touted by Gravity\u2019s creators found that 63 percent of individuals who used a 30-pound weighted blanket had reduced symptoms of anxiety. But the research included only 32 adults and no control group. \n \n The creators of the blanket did not respond to a request for comment. \n \n Ismail said it isn\u2019t clear who, exactly, the blanket would benefit. Many cases of sleeplessness result from poor sleep hygiene, like being glued to a phone before bed; others result from underlying psychiatric disorders that require treatment. \n \n \u201cIt might have a role, but in a very, very small subset of patients,\u201d Ismail said, \u201cand I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve identified that subset of patients with a really good randomized controlled trial.\u201d \n \n The campaign says it expects to start shipping blankets in October. \n \n This post has been updated with information about new changes to the Kickstarter page. ||||| News moves fast, even in the world of quirky Kickstarter campaigns. \n \n Earlier this week, we wrote about a weighted blanket generating a lot of buzz (and money) on the crowdfunding platform. Called Gravity, the blanket\u2019s selling point was that, by generating \u201cthe feeling of being held or hugged,\ufffd? it could be used to treat everything from insomnia to anxiety. \n \n It was a bold claim (as we noted, there\u2019s not much research on weighted blankets\u2019 impact on the body.) Too bold, it turns out, for Kickstarter\u2019s own rules. \n \n After STAT, a health-focused news website, reached out to the crowdfunding company, asking for more information on the \u201cscience\ufffd? validating Gravity Blanket\u2019s assertion that it can treat \u201cinsomnia, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, as well as circumstantial stress and prolonged anxiety,\ufffd?the project\u2019s messaging was changed to say the blanket can be \u201cused\ufffd? for these conditions. \n \n As STAT notes, the previous language appears to violate Kickstarter\u2019s rules, which bans campaigns that claim to \u201ccure, treat, or prevent an illness or condition.\ufffd? \n \n The Gravity blanket is still available on Kickstarter where, as of this writing, it\u2019s raised more than $3.2 million. But it\u2019s a good general reminder to be skeptical of wellness products peddling outsized health claims. Unlike medications, this category isn\u2019t regulated by the FDA, which gives companies broad leeway to say their product can treat any number of conditions without supplying the necessary evidence to back it up. ||||| Gravity is a premium-grade, therapeutic weighted blanket that harnesses the power of deep touch stimulation to gently distribute deep pressure across your body. \n \n Engineered to be around 10% of your body weight, Gravity helps relax the nervous system by simulating the feeling of being held or hugged. \n \n This increases serotonin and melatonin levels and decreases cortisol levels\u2014improving your mood and promoting restful sleep at the same time. All without ever filling a prescription. \n \n Dimensions: 48\" by 72\" \n \n Weighted blankets are well known within the medical community, where they\u2019ve been used as a natural stress reliever for decades.

So far, the findings have been incredible. \n \n Gravity uses the power of proprioceptive input (more commonly known as \u201cdeep touch pressure stimulation\u201d), a well regarded therapeutic method that stimulates pressure points on the body linked to improved sleep, mood, and relaxation. \n \n The result is a reduction in cortisol levels and an increase in serotonin production, which decreases heart rate and blood pressure. \n \n Even hospitals use weighted blankets to calm patients' anxiety and promote deep, restful sleep. In a similar way to swaddling an infant, the weight and pressure on an adult provides near-instant comfort and relief. \n \n http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J004v24n01_05 \n \n http://www.somna.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Pilot-study-of-a-sensory-room-in-an-acute-inpatient-psychiatric-unit.pdf \n \n Gravity is designed to hug you back at night, closely mimicking how a parent swaddles their child while they sleep. But Gravity isn\u2019t just for sleep. It can be used while you\u2019re reading in bed, as you relax on your couch, or while you meditate. \n \n Best of all? Gravity is engineered with breathable materials, so you\u2019ll never be too hot underneath the covers. \n \n The world around you is a stressful place. The barrage of news headlines. The incessant push notifications. The demands of your job. It\u2019s never been harder to turn your mind off, relax, and recharge. \n \n The average American now spends 30 percent of their leisure time browsing the web, and 61% of us admit to being addicted to our devices. At work, it\u2019s even worse. The average employee checks 40 websites per day, and changes tasks every two minutes. As a result, we spend nearly two hours a day recovering from distractions. \n \n Sleep loss, prolonged anxiety, and stress take a real toll on our lives\u2014they decrease productivity during the day and can lead to long-term health problems like diabetes, obesity, and even heart disease. \n \n We know your anatomy is unique, which is why we\u2019ve engineered Gravity to meet your personal needs. This isn\u2019t a weighted blanket for everyone. It\u2019s a weighted blanket for you. \n \n Weighted blankets should be around 10% of your body weight, which is why we\u2019re offering 15, 20, and 25 pound options. Choose your preference (suggested based off of weight). \n \n But Gravity is more than the science that engineers it. From beautiful design to thoughtful materials sourcing, we set out to craft a product that looks and feels as great as it performs. \n \n Taking design cues from renderings of gravity planes, we used the same grid-like pattern to evenly distribute the crafted poly pellets to specifically target pressure points throughout your body. \n \n The cover is made from a luxurious, ultra-soft micro plush fleece, and is easily removable for washing. The inner shell is made of 100% cotton. \n \n The Weighted Filling \n \n Gravity Blanket's weighted filling is a High Density Plastic Poly Pellet. The material is odorless, non-toxic, and food grade, making it perfectly suited for use in a blanket. They are dense to add weight, and soft to provide a nice texture to the Gravity Weighted Blanket. High Density Plastic Pellets are manufactured using High Density Polyethylene (HDPE), which is extremely durable, non-toxic, washer / dryer safe, and pet and kid friendly. \n \n April-May: Run Kickstarter \n \n May-June: Kickstarter complete-Production begins \n \n June-July: Production completed \n \n July-August: Product ships to our bi-coastal fulfillment houses \n \n Sept-Oct: All Kickstarter rewards delivered just in time for fall! \n \n You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

The crowdfunding campaign has raised $3.5 million with 15 days to go, but now, a thorn: Health news site STAT started nosing around the $279 gray coverlet's bid to be something of a cure-all and found the science behind its assertions to be lacking. STAT calls out one word in particular: \"treat.\" The original Kickstarter listing said the weighted blanket can \"treat\" a slew of issues including PTSD and ADHD. STAT reports that on Thursday the word \"treat\" was dropped in favor of \"used for\" those ailments; then the paragraph was wiped entirely. STAT reports the original language went against Kickstarter's own rules banning claims to \"cure, treat, or prevent an illness or condition.\" The pledge violated FDA recommendations, per STAT, though Fortune notes the agency doesn't regulate the industry and gives companies \"broad leeway\" to make medical claims. The Brooklyn-based makers say the blanket, which comes in three weights and should weigh about 10% of body weight, uses \"deep pressure touch stimulation\" to boost brain hormones that \"improve your mood.\" All of this, they add, \"without filling a prescription.\" The Kickstarter listing acknowledges weighted coverings are not a new idea, but says the idea of making them so accessible is. The Telegraph cites a 2015 study that credited the blankets with promoting a \"beneficial calming effect.\" (This entrepreneur has made big bucks via Kickstarter knockoffs.)",

Authorities are working to determine what exactly happened to Forrest and Donna Sanco while en route to Rum Cay on September 26, one day after the pair flew their private aircraft from Houston, Texas; through Florida and then Freeport, Grand Bahama where the couple reportedly cleared customs and spent the night. \n \n Bahamas Air and Sea Rescue Association (BASRA) Operations Manager Chris Lloyd on Tuesday confirmed that Mr Sanco officially closed his flight plan at 4:58pm on September 26, signalling to air traffic controllers that he was nearing his destination. \n \n However, according to his family members and caretakers in Rum Cay, the pair never arrived.

    "document": "Study Highlights: \n \n A commonly used heartburn medication caused blood vessel cells to age faster in laboratory testing. \n \n These findings could help explain recent reports linking long-term use of heartburn medication to several serious illnesses, including heart disease, kidney disease and dementia. \n \n Clinical studies still are necessary to determine if the drugs damage blood vessel cells within the body. \n \n Embargoed until 3 p.m. CT / 4 p.m. ET Tuesday, May 10, 2016 \n \n DALLAS, May 10, 2016 \u2014 A popular over-the-counter medication for heartburn, caused laboratory blood vessel cells to age quicker, according to new research in Circulation Research, an American Heart Association journal. \n \n Reflux, often called heartburn, occurs when stomach acid backs up into the esophagus, causing irritation and damage. Mild reflux is fairly common, but frequent, severe occurrences, known as GERD for gastroesophageal reflux disease, can cause significant discomfort and may require treatment. Many people find relief by using over-the-counter medications called proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which reduce acid produced by the stomach. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration estimates that 1 in 14 Americans have used PPIs. \n \n After recent evidence linking long-term PPI use to several serious illnesses, including heart disease, kidney disease and dementia, researcher sought to identify how PPIs increase risk by studying their effects on blood vessel cells. \n \n Now, researchers at Houston Methodist Research Institute (HMRI) say they have discovered that long term exposure to PPIs \u201caccelerated biological aging in human endothelial cells which line the inside of blood vessels. When healthy, human endothelial cells create a Teflon-like coating that prevents blood from sticking. When older and diseased, the endothelium becomes more like Velcro, with blood elements sticking to the vessel to form blockages.\u201d \n \n They also found that long-term PPI exposure impairs acid production by the lysosomes in the cells lining the blood vessel walls. They noted that the lysosome \u2014 the part of the cell that typically clears waste products \u2014 did not produce enough acid to clear waste. In turn, the buildup of waste caused the cell to age rapidly. Notably, another type of antacid known as an H2 antagonist, did not have this adverse effect. \n \n \u201cLysosomes are like the garbage disposal of cells,\u201d said John P. Cooke, M.D., Ph.D., study lead author and professor and chair of the Department of Cardiovascular Sciences at the HMRI and director of the Houston Methodist Research Institute Center for Cardiovascular Regeneration in Texas. \u201cThey need to generate acid to get rid of cellular rubbish, and when cellular rubbish accumulates the cells age faster.\u201d \n \n Although PPIs can be effective for short-term use, they are not meant for extended treatment, researchers said. PPIs do not require a prescription or doctor\u2019s supervision, which can lead to overuse. \n \n \u201cWith the knowledge that PPIs are being used by millions of people for indications and durations that were never tested or approved, it may be time for the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory agencies to re-visit the specificity and the safety of these agents,\u201d Cooke said. \u201cUnless otherwise indicated, physicians should consider PPIs only for short-term use for relief of symptoms of GERD, since we now have a \u2018smoking gun\u2019 that helps explain the consistent observational evidence of increased risk.\u201d \n \n Cooke added that there are other approaches to long-term treatment that might be considered for GERD including H2 antagonists, lifestyle modifications, and in severe cases, surgical approaches. \n \n The current one has several limitations. Although two different PPIs were tested, only one of these esomeprazole (brand name Nexium) is commercially available. In addition, it did not show how PPIs actually impair the lysosome\u2019s ability to produce enough acid to clear waste. Finally, since this study was in a laboratory setting, it could not show whether PPIs act in the same way within the human body, and long-term clinical trials are necessary. \n \n Co-authors are Gautham Yepuri, Ph.D.; Roman Sukhovershin, Ph.D.; Timo Z.

Known as PPIs, they are among the most prescribed drugs in the United States and are widely available over the counter. \n \n But according to preliminary research presented today at an American Heart Association conference in New Orleans, these medications may also increase the risk of ischemic stroke \n \n Ischemic strokes are the most common type of stroke, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . They occur when a blood clot cuts off blood flow to the brain. \n \n \"PPIs have been associated with unhealthy vascular function, including heart attacks, kidney disease and dementia,\" said Dr. Thomas Sehested, the study's lead author and a researcher at the Danish Heart Foundation . \"We wanted to see if PPIs also posed a risk for ischemic stroke, especially given their increasing use in the general population.\" \n \n Most serious warning yet \n \n Protonix, The research was conducted in Denmark among a quarter-million patients who suffered from stomach pain and indigestion, and were taking one of four PPIs: Prilosec Prevacid or Nexium \n \n Overall stroke risk increased 21% among patients who were taking a PPI, according to the study. At the lowest doses, the authors found either no or minimal increased risk of stroke. At the highest doses, they found that stroke risk increased 33% for Prilosec and Prevacid patients, 50% for Nexium patients and 79% for Protonix patients. \n \n In an email to CNN, P&G, the company that makes Prilosec, said the drug is an \"FDA approved, safe and effective remedy to relieve frequent heartburn symptoms. Prilosec OTC has the longest history of safe and effective consumer use of any [over the counter] PPI.\" \n \n Takeda, the maker of Prevacid, said it could not comment on the results and conclusions of the study until the full data is published for review. \"Patient safety is a top priority ... and we continuously monitor the safety of all our medicines and collaborate with regulatory agencies to ensure this information is reflected in the respective prescribing information,\" a spokesman said in an email to CNN. \n \n AstraZeneca, the maker of Nexium, said, \"Patient safety is an important priority ... and we believe all of our PPI medicines are generally safe and effective when used in accordance with the label.\" A spokeswoman said the company was not consulted during the research, so it could not comment on the data. \n \n Pfizer, the maker of Protonix, did not respond to CNN's request for comment. \n \n \"At one time, PPIs were thought to be safe, without major side effects,\" Sehested said. \"This study further questions the cardiovascular safety of these drugs.\" \n \n JUST WATCHED Drug-resistant bacteria found in U.S. Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Drug-resistant bacteria found in U.S. 02:18 \n \n A pair of 2010 studies found that PPIs were associated with an increased risk of a serious bacterial infection . Stomach acid seems to play a role in killing off both good and bad bacteria in our gut. When someone is taking PPIs, their amount of stomach acid is reduced, and it creates an environment in which bacteria can flourish. \n \n \"As a culture, we tend to want a pill to deal with our problems, when a lot of people could reduce their heartburn by eating smaller meals, drinking less alcohol or not smoking,\" Dr. Michael Katz, who wrote an editorial accompanying the studies, told CNN in 2010 \n \n In April, another study published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology found that patients who took PPIs had a 96% increased risk of kidney failure and a 28% increased risk of kidney disease, compared with those who were prescribed alternative medications. \n \n What are the alternatives? \n \n Medical professionals estimate that the majority of people who suffer from acid reflux or heartburn could drastically or completely reduce their discomfort by making a few lifestyle changes: quit smoking, lose weight and cut back on spicy and fatty foods. \n \n If your doctor determines that you do need pills for your problem, pharmacist NaaDede Badger-Plange suggests starting with an antacid , such as Tums, Rolaids or Maalox. \n \n JUST WATCHED Ways to treat heartburn Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Ways to treat heartburn 02:40 \n \n \"Antacids usually would help if you have less than one incident a week,\" Badger-Plange said . \"So, if you have heartburn very rarely -- especially people who have heartburn associated with certain foods -- they could take antacids.\" \n \n Antacids provide quick relief, but only for a short amount of time, said Badger-Plange, and consumers should pay close attention to the ingredients on the label. If you're pregnant, you should avoid sodium bicarbonate and magnesium trisilicate. Patients with kidney disease should avoid antacids that contain aluminum. \n \n For longer-lasting relief, H2 antagonist medications (also called H2 blockers) are also an option, but they can take a few hours to kick in. \n \n Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter. \n \n \"One thing to keep in mind is, certain products that are in the H2 receptor antagonist class have drug interactions,\" Badger-Plange said. \"So, if you have a lot of medications, you probably want to check with your pharmacist at the counter to make sure it's OK to take those medications.\" \n \n As always, you should talk to your doctor before starting or stopping any medication -- prescribed or over the counter. \n \n For years, Katz has been worried that PPIs \"reinforce the idea that the solution to behavioral health issues is to take a pill, and that's just not how we're going to get healthier,\" he said in 2010. \"Consumers need to ask their doctors, 'Why am I taking this?

Over eight pages of tightly worded argument, they remind the president of the positive debate that Snowden\u2019s disclosures sparked \u2013 prompting one of the few examples of truly bipartisan legislative change in recent years. \n \n They also remind Obama of the long record of leniency that has been shown by his own and previous administrations towards those who have broken secrecy laws. They even recall how their own Church committee revealed that six US presidents, from Franklin Roosevelt to Richard Nixon, were guilty of abusing secret powers. \n \n \u201cThere is no question that Snowden broke the law. But previous cases in which others violated the same law suggest leniency. And most importantly, Snowden\u2019s actions were not for personal benefit, but were intended to spur reform. And they did so,\u201d the signatories write. \n \n The Church committee, or the US Senate select committee to study government operations with respect to intelligence activities, to give it its full name, sat in 1975-76 at a time of deep public anxiety about the rogue work of federal agencies. The aftershocks of Watergate were still being felt, and Seymour Hersh had exposed in the New York Times mass illegal activities by the CIA, including routine surveillance of anti-war groups. \n \n As the 15 staff members point out, the committee investigation led to the disclosure of jaw-dropping illegal acts including the planting of an FBI informant inside the civil rights group the NAACP, attempts to push Martin Luther King into killing himself, and Cointelpro, the vast program run secretly by the FBI to disrupt progressive organisations in the US. \n \n The lead signatories of the Obama letter are Frederick Schwarz, who was chief counsel to the Church committee and is now at the Brennan Center for Justice, and William Green Miller, the committee\u2019s staff director who went on to become US ambassador to Ukraine in the 1990s. Together with their fellow former staffers, they add heft to a campaign to pardon Snowden that has already attracted the support of prominent public figures including the co-founder of Apple Steve Wozniak, philanthropist George Soros and Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the world wide web. \n \n Privacy experts fear Donald Trump running global surveillance network Read more \n \n In their letter, which they have also sent to the US attorney general, Loretta Lynch, the 15 cite the former CIA director David Petraeus as an example of the kind of official leniency that has so far eluded Snowden. Petraeus violated both the law and national security by leaking confidential information to his biographer and lover, then lied about it to the FBI. \n \n \u201cYet he was allowed to plead guilty to just one misdemeanor for which he received no jail time,\u201d the letter says. The reference to Petraeus is pointed at a time when the former military commander is being actively considered by President-elect Donald Trump to become US secretary of state. \n \n Trump gains no mention in the former staffers\u2019 plea to Obama, but he is the elephant in the room. The letter writers state euphemistically: \u201cAs the US relationship with Russia deteriorates, the risk to all interests involved increases.\u201d \n \n They stop short of adding that Trump\u2019s close ties to Russia, and his notorious flattery towards Vladimir Putin, could imperil Snowden\u2019s current asylum in that country. ||||| Members of a committee that investigated the CIA during the Watergate era have urged President Obama to show leniency on NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden and strike a deal to allow him to return home. \n \n 15 former members of the 1970s Church Committee, led by its former chief counsel Frederick Schwarz Jr. and ex-staff director William Green Miller, sent an eight-page letter to the President and Attorney General Loretta Lynch arguing that Snowden\u2019s actions were a catalyst that helped change secret service policy for the better. \n \n \u201cThere is no question that Edward Snowden\u2019s disclosures led to public awareness which stimulated reform. Whether or not these clear benefits to the country merit a pardon, they surely do counsel for leniency,\u201d the letter reads. \n \n Snowden has been living in Russia since he fled the U.S. via Hong Kong in 2013. He is charged with espionage for leaking internal NSA documents to the press and could face 30 years in jail should he return to American shores. While Obama has refused to pardon him, even in the wake of President-elect Donald Trump nominating a man who once said Snowden should be executed for head of the CIA, the Church committee group said Snowden\u2019s disclosures have been instrumental in enacting much-needed change. \n \n The group argued that the information he brought to the public domain resulted in reform of the Patriot Act, a change in how the NSA gathers data from foreigners, and it more broadly alerted the American people to \u201cwhat intelligence agencies acting in our name had been up to.\u201d \n \n \u201cWhen intelligence agencies operate in the dark, they often have gone too far in trampling on the legitimate rights of law-abiding Americans and damaging our reputation internationally. We saw this repeated time and time again when serving as staff members for the U.S. Senate Select Committee\u2026 that in 1975-76 conducted the most extensive bipartisan investigation of a government\u2019s secret activities ever, in this country or elsewhere,\u201d the letter further argued. \n \n Of course, Snowden did break the law with his actions. \n \n On the part, the group put forward examples of past cases around the misuse of classified documents, such as National Security Advisor Sandy Berger and CIA Directors David Petraeus and John Deutch. They argued that Snowden acted in a more selfless way than others who were shown leniency for their actions, and that this should be given due consideration. \n \n \u201cSnowden\u2019s explicit intent was to raise public awareness about activities that he believed (and that all three branches of government have to varying degrees affirmed) were illegal, or overbroad, so that there could be a robust public discussion about the proper scope of government surveillance. \n \n \u201cSnowden did not try to mask his identity, or lie to the FBI. He knew he would pay a personal price. As he has,\u201d the group added. \n \n Back in September, activists and lawyers from a number of human rights organizations came together to present Obama with a case to pardon Snowden. This time around, the former Church committee group is asking for leniency since it doesn\u2019t believe that a full pardon is a feasible outcome. It closed its message to the President with the hope that authorities can \u201cnegotiate a settlement with Edward Snowden of the charges against him that both sides can accept.\u201d ||||| Fifteen staff members who worked on a well-known bipartisan intelligence watchdog committee wrote to President Barack Obama and Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Monday requesting the administration negotiate a plea agreement with former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. \n \n \u201cThere is no question that Edward Snowden\u2019s disclosures led to public awareness which stimulated reform,\u201d wrote the staffers who served on the U.S. Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operation with Respect to Intelligence Activities \u2014 called the Church Committee, after its chairman, Idaho Sen. Frank Church. \n \n \u201cWhether or not these clear benefits to the country merit a pardon, they surely do counsel for leniency,\u201d the authors continued. \n \n Frederick, or \u201cFritz\u201d Schwarz, Jr., the Church Committee\u2019s chief counsel who now heads up policy and legal advocacy organization the Brennan Center for Justice, penned the letter alongside the committee\u2019s staff director, William Green Miller, and 13 other co-signers. \n \n Schwarz, who published a book last year on the allure of government secrecy called Democracy in the Dark, says he has been captivated by Snowden since the former National Security Agency contractor first made his disclosures. \u201cI\u2019ve known many whistleblowers starting when I was chief counsel of the Church Committee, and they\u2019re often praise worthy \u2026 but [Snowden] seemed straightforward and genuine,\u201d he said during a phone interview with The Intercept. \n \n In the 1970s, the Church Committee conducted an unprecedented investigation that uncovered abuses by the intelligence community and led to reforms. Schwarz recalled, during a recorded interview with the Brennan Center\u2019s Michael German, being involved in the first and \u201cmost comprehensive\u201d investigation into the intelligence community, which was aimed at being \u201copen and rigorous\u201d \u2014 challenging senators who willfully turned a blind eye to the nation\u2019s spies and their misdeeds. \n \n The climate at the time, wracked with scandals like Watergate and leaks like the Pentagon Papers, \u201cled to a pent up interest in what the secret government had been doing,\u201d he said. \n \n The committee uncovered the NSA\u2019s practice of retaining copies of telegrams sent overseas, the CIA\u2019s experimentation with hallucinogenic drugs and use of domestic surveillance, and the FBI\u2019s widely discredited program under J. Edgar Hoover, called COINTELPRO, involving the monitoring of constitutionally protected activities. \n \n Yet that climate of support for reform and investigation has changed, the authors argued. \u201cThe government has all but stopped making bipartisan reforms,\u201d they wrote, arguing that this has left whistleblowers to take matters into their own hands. \n \n Snowden, who provided a massive trove of documents about the government\u2019s worldwide surveillance regime to journalists in 2013, served as the spark to inspire lawmakers to reach across the aisle and amend the Patriot Act, ending the bulk collection metadata program in the summer of 2015, they wrote. And, his revelations uncovered the extent of overseas spying, which the Church Committee staffers note led President Obama to promise stronger privacy protections for foreigners. \n \n If Snowden hadn\u2019t come forward, Americans might never have known about the abuses taking place, the authors argue. \u201cWe know first hand that lack of disclosure can cause just as many, if not more, harms to the nation than disclosure,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWhen intelligence agencies operate in the dark, they often have gone too far in trampling on the legitimate rights of law-abiding Americans and damaging our reputation internationally.\u201d \n \n They also noted that the government has been lenient towards senior national security officials who have been involved in divulging secrets, like former CIA Director David Petraeus, who provided classified information to his biographer, with whom he was having an affair, and pled guilty to a simple misdemeanor. \n \n Petraeus is now reportedly being considered for a role in President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s administration. \n \n \u201cIn all these cases, recognition of the public service the individuals had provided weighed against strict enforcement of the law, to come to a fair and just result,\u201d the authors wrote. \n \n Meanwhile, the harsh treatment of other whistleblowers, like Thomas Drake and Chelsea Manning, may have inspired Snowden to take the route he did, they suggest. \n \n The authors directly challenged several assertions made by the House Intelligence Committee in a short unclassified excerpt of its investigation into Snowden\u2019s motivations and actions, which concluded in September. The full contents of the House\u2019s investigation remain classified, though the committee has submitted it for declassification and publication. \n \n Notably, the former Church Committee staffers did not advocate for a pardon, something President Obama has rejected as a possibility. Instead, they urged the government to consider offering Snowden a deal. \n \n \u201cUnder current law, the only way to weigh the public benefits of Snowden\u2019s leaks and account for his aim to help America is for the government to mitigate the charges through settlement discussions,\u201d they concluded. \n \n \u201cI felt a flat pardon as opposed to what we call for, a negotiation with leniency, was very unlikely to happen,\u201d Schwarz explained. \n \n When asked if the current political climate might stifle further reform, given the incoming administration and President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s known volatility, Schwarz was diplomatic: \u201cI think we need to be eternally watchful.\u201d",

The next day, it was taken away because he wore it. Here endeth the lesson. \n \n How do you practice humility from the most exalted throne on earth? Rarely has a new player on the world stage captured so much attention so quickly\u2014young and old, faithful and cynical\u2014as has Pope Francis. In his nine months in office, he has placed himself at the very center of the central conversations of our time: about wealth and poverty, fairness and justice, transparency, modernity, globalization, the role of women, the nature of marriage, the temptations of power. \n \n At a time when the limits of leadership are being tested in so many places, along comes a man with no army or weapons, no kingdom beyond a tight fist of land in the middle of Rome but with the immense wealth and weight of history behind him, to throw down a challenge. The world is getting smaller; individual voices are getting louder; technology is turning virtue viral, so his pulpit is visible to the ends of the earth. When he kisses the face of a disfigured man or washes the feet of a Muslim woman, the image resonates far beyond the boundaries of the Catholic Church. \n \n (PERSON OF THE YEAR: Pope Francis, The People\u2019s Pope) \n \n The skeptics will point to the obstacles Francis faces in accomplishing much of anything beyond making casual believers feel better about the softer tone coming out of Rome while feeling free to ignore the harder substance. The Catholic Church is one of the oldest, largest and richest institutions on earth, with a following 1.2 billion strong, and change does not come naturally. At its best it inspires and instructs, helps and heals and calls the faithful to heed their better angels. But it has been weakened worldwide by scandal, corruption, a shortage of priests and a challenge, especially across the fertile mission fields of the southern hemisphere, from evangelical and Pentecostal rivals. In some quarters, core teachings on divorce and contraception are widely ignored and orthodoxy derided as obsolete. Vatican bureaucrats and clergy stand accused of infighting, graft, blackmail and an obsession with \u201csmall-minded rules,\u201d as Francis puts it, rather than the vast possibilities of grace. Don\u2019t just preach; listen, he says. Don\u2019t scold; heal. \n \n And yet in less than a year, he has done something remarkable: he has not changed the words, but he\u2019s changed the music. Tone and temperament matter in a church built on the substance of symbols\u2014bread and wine, body and blood\u2014so it is a mistake to dismiss any Pope\u2019s symbolic choices\u00ad as gestures empty of the force of law. He released his first exhortation, an attack on \u201cthe idolatry of money,\u201d just as Americans were contemplating the day set aside for gratitude and whether to spend it at the mall. This is a man with a sense of timing. He lives not in the papal palace surrounded by courtiers but in a spare hostel surrounded by priests. He prays all the time, even while waiting for the dentist. He has retired the papal Mercedes in favor of a scuffed-up Ford Focus. No red shoes, no gilded cross, just an iron one around his neck. When he rejects the pomp and the privilege, releases information on Vatican finances for the first time, reprimands a profligate German Archbishop, cold-calls strangers in distress, offers to baptize the baby of a divorced woman whose married lover wanted her to abort it, he is doing more than modeling mercy and \u00adtransparency. He is \u00adembracing complexity and acknowledging the risk that a church obsessed with its own rights and righteousness could inflict more wounds than it heals. Asked why he seems uninterested in waging a culture war, he refers to the battlefield. The church is a field hospital, he says. Our first duty is to tend to the wounded. You don\u2019t ask a bleeding man about his cholesterol level. \n \n (MORE: Everything You Wanted to Know about TIME\u2019s Person of the Year) \n \n This focus on compassion, along with a general aura of merriment not always associated with princes of the church, has made Francis something of a rock star. More than 3 million people turned out to see him on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro last summer, the crowds in St. Peter\u2019s Square are ecstatic, and the souvenirs are selling fast. Francesco is the most popular male baby name in Italy. Churches report a \u201cFrancis effect\u201d of lapsed Catholics returning to Mass and confession, though anecdotes are no substitute for hard evidence, and surveys of U.S. Catholics, at least, see little change in practice thus far. But the fascination with Francis even outside his flock gives him an opportunity that his predecessor, Benedict XVI, never had\u2014to magnify the message of the church and its power to do great good. \n \n The giddy embrace of the secular press makes Francis suspect among traditionalists who fear he buys popularity at the price of a watered-down faith. He has deftly leveraged the media\u2019s fascination to draw attention to everything from his prayers for peace in Syria to his pointed attack on trickle-down economics, which inspired Jesse Jackson to compare him to Martin Luther King Jr. and Rush Limbaugh to wonder whether he\u2019s a Marxist. When you are a media celebrity, every word you speak is dissected, as are those you choose not to speak. Why has he not said more about the priest sex-abuse scandal? ask victims\u2019 advocates. (Just this month, he set up a commission to address the abuse of children by priests.) Why does he not talk more about the sanctity of life? ask conservatives, who note that in his exhortation, abortion is mentioned once, mercy 32 times. Francis both affirms traditional teachings on sexuality and warns that the church has become distracted by them. He attacks priests who won\u2019t baptize children born out of wedlock for their \u201crigorous and hypocritical neo-clericalism.\u201d He declares that God \u201chas redeemed all of us \u2026 not just Catholics. Everyone, even atheists.\u201d He posed with environmental activists holding an antifracking T-shirt and called on politicians and business leaders to be \u201cprotectors of creation.\u201d \n \n (MORE: Behind the Pope Francis Cover) \n \n None of which makes him a liberal\u2014he also says the all-male priesthood is not subject to debate, nor is abortion, nor is the definition of marriage. But his focus on the poor and the fact that the world\u2019s poorest 50% control barely 1% of its wealth unsettles those who defend capitalism as the most successful antipoverty program in history. You could argue that he is Teddy Roosevelt protecting capitalism from its own excesses or he is simply saying what Popes before him have said, that Jesus calls us to care for the least among us\u2014only he\u2019s saying it in a way that people seem to be hearing differently. And that may be especially important coming from the first Pope from the New World. A century ago, two-thirds of Catholics lived in Europe; now fewer than a quarter do, and how he is heard in countries where being gay is a crime and educating women for leadership roles is a heresy may have the power to transform cultures in which Catholicism is a growing, even potentially liberating force. \n \n These days it is bracing to hear a leader say anything that annoys anyone. Now liberals and conservatives alike face a choice as they listen to a new voice of conscience: Which matters more, that this charismatic leader is saying things they think need to be said or that he is also saying things they\u2019d rather not hear? \n \n The heart is a strong muscle; he\u2019s proposing a rigorous exercise plan. And in a very short time, a vast, global, ecumenical audience has shown a hunger to follow him. For pulling the papacy out of the palace and into the streets, for committing the world\u2019s largest church to confronting its deepest needs and for balancing judgment with mercy, Pope Francis is TIME\u2019s 2013 Person of the Year. ||||| Illustration by Jason Seiler for TIME \n \n To avoid surveillance, the first four Americans to visit Edward Snowden in Moscow carried no cell phones or laptops. They flew coach on Delta from Washington with tickets paid for by Dutch computer hackers. After checking into a preselected hotel not far from Red Square, they waited for a van to pick them up for dinner. \n \n None could retrace the ride that followed, driven by anonymous Russian security men, nor could any place the side door of the building where the trip ended. They passed through two cavernous ballrooms, the second with a painted ceiling like the Sistine Chapel, and emerged into a smaller space with salmon-colored walls and oil paintings in golden frames\u2014like Alice in Wonderland, remembers one of the group. There at the bottom of the rabbit hole, in rimless glasses, a black suit and blue shirt with two open buttons at the collar, stood the 30-year-old computer whiz who had just committed the most spectacular heist in the history of spycraft. \n \n By all accounts, Snowden was delighted to see his countrymen, though over the next six hours he did not partake of the wine. At one point, Ray McGovern, a former CIA analyst, recited from memory in Russian an Alexander Pushkin poem, \u201cThe Prisoner,\u201d which he had learned back in his days spying on the Soviet Union. \u201cWe have nothing to lose except everything, so let us go ahead,\u201d said Jesselyn Radack, a former Justice Department attorney, quoting Albert Camus\u2019s warning at the dawn of the nuclear age. Another attendee, the whistle-blowing FBI agent Coleen Rowley, compared Snowden to Benjamin Franklin, who as postmaster general in 1773 helped leak letters from American officials who were secretly collaborating with British authorities. \n \n Even Snowden\u2019s Russian lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, raised his glass for a toast. Coming from a man with close ties to the Kremlin and a knack for misleading the press, Kucherena\u2019s words captured the surreal nature of Snowden\u2019s Moscow exile. \u201cEd, I am going to give you the biggest gift that I can probably give,\u201d he told Snowden through an interpreter. \u201cI\u2019m writing a novel about you.\u201d \n \n The gathering had been called to deliver an award, given by four dissident veterans of the U.S. national-security apparatus to one of their own. But for Snowden it was something more, a chance to reaffirm to the world the purpose of his actions, for which he has been charged in absentia with theft and violations of the Espionage Act. Since escaping his country in late May with tens of thousands of its most secret documents\u2014\u201cone of everything,\u201d jokes one person with access to the stash\u2014Snowden has chosen to lie low. No Twitter account. No television interviews. No direct contacts with U.S. authorities. He held his tongue as Kucherena boasted to the press about Snowden\u2019s new Internet job in Moscow, his new Russian girlfriend and his dire money troubles. Most of that is fiction, like the novel, according to several people who communicate regularly with Snowden. \n \n But he has nonetheless begun to figure out a life for himself in Russia, where he has been granted asylum for at least one year. He is learning Russian, recently read Fyodor Dostoyevsky\u2019s Crime and Punishment and spent weeks living with his WikiLeaks protector, Sarah Harrison, who has since flown to Berlin, fearing that she could face criminal charges if she returns to her native Britain. Most important, he has been able to spend time on the Internet, his lifelong home, where he has watched through encrypted and anonymized connections as his leaks roil the world\u2014diplomatic crises, congressional reform efforts, new federal lawsuits, financial damage to U.S. technology companies and an as yet uncertain harm to U.S. national interests, including documented changes in the way terrorists communicate online. \u201cThis increases the probability that a terrorist attack will get through,\u201d says General Keith Alexander, the director of the National Security Agency (NSA). \u201cI think it\u2019s absolutely wrong.\u201d \n \n For Snowden, those impacts are but a means to a different end. He didn\u2019t give up his freedom to tip off German Chancellor Angela Merkel about the American snoops on her cell phone or to detail the ways the NSA electronically records jihadi porn-watching habits. He wanted to issue a warning to the world, and he believed that revealing the classified information at his fingertips was the way to do it. His gambit has so far proved more successful than he reasonably could have hoped\u2014he is alive, not in prison, and six months on, his documents still make headlines daily\u2014but his work is not done, and his fate is far from certain. So in early October, he invited to Moscow some supporters who wanted to give him an award. \n \n EPA Snowden received the Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence award in Moscow in October. \n \n After the toasts, some photographs and a brief ceremony, Snowden sat back down at the table, spread with a Russian buffet, to describe once again the dystopian landscape he believes is unfolding inside the classified computer networks on which he worked as a contractor. Here was a place that collected enormous amounts of information on regular citizens as a precaution, a place where U.S. law and policy did not recognize the right to privacy of foreigners operating outside the country, a place where he believed the basic freedoms of modern democratic states\u2014\u201cto speak and to think and to live and be creative, to have relationships and to associate freely\u201d\u2014were under threat. \n \n \u201cThere is a far cry between legal programs, legitimate spying, legitimate law enforcement\u2014where it is targeted, it\u2019s based on reasonable suspicion, individualized suspicion and warranted action\u2014and the sort of dragnet mass surveillance that puts entire populations under a sort of an eye and sees everything, even when it is not needed,\u201d Snowden told his colleagues. \u201cThis is about a trend in the relationship between the governing and governed in America.\u201d ||||| illustration by Jesse Lenz for TIME \n \n A few years ago, a high-ranking U.S. intelligence official was asked what he most wanted to know about Bashar Assad, the Syrian leader. \u201cWhether he\u2019s Michael or Fredo,\u201d he replied. \u201cWhether Syria\u2019s [leadership] is singular or plural.\u201d \n \n The Corleone reference, from The Godfather, was apt. The Assads have run Syria as a mafia family business since 1970, when Bashar\u2019s father Hafez Assad gained control in a Baathist coup. The Assads are \u00adAlawites, a Shi\u2018ite-related minority sect, and Hafez Assad ruled his 80% Sunni country with a relentless brutality. In 1982 he put down a rebellion by the Muslim Brotherhood in the city of Hama, killing an estimated 20,000 people. \n \n Bashar Assad was not expected to succeed his father. He had been trained in England as an ophthalmologist and was married to a stylish investment banker. His charismatic older brother Bassel was the designated successor, but Bassel died violently in a car crash, and when Hafez died in 2000, Bashar became a rather unlikely President of Syria. \n \n He didn\u2019t look like a tyrant. He was gawky-tall, soft-spoken, with a halfhearted mustache and milky blue eyes. At first, some in the U.S. intelligence community believed he was a front man for a family consortium that included his older sister Bushra and her husband General Assef Shawkat, who controlled the Syrian intelligence services; there was also a younger brother, Maher, an alleged hothead in charge of the army\u2019s Republican Guard. \n \n When I interviewed Assad in 2005, it was difficult to tell if he was Michael or Fredo or someone else entirely. He was not at all bombastic or egomaniacal; he seemed a bit nervous. And yet he was thoughtful, eager to engage in a real conversation rather than filibuster the interview, the usual modus operandi for despots. He sat slouched on a couch\u2014not exactly the body language of an aggressor\u2014and seemed boggled by his predicament. \n \n He knew he was dancing through a minefield. President George W. Bush had sent the \u201cwith us or against us\u201d message to the region after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and Syria was trying to be both and neither. The government had allowed a de facto safe haven for the funders of Iraq\u2019s Sunni rebels and for assorted anti-Israel terrorist groups. The Syrian intelligence forces were suspected of abetting Hizballah in the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri. And the Assads were Iran\u2019s main ally in the region. Syria\u2019s contradictory tangle of allegiances and private arrangements was, in fact, a perfect exemplar of the mind-numbing complexity of Middle East politics. \n \n SANA / AP After his sudden appointment as president in 2000, Assad, right, relied heavily on advisers like army chief of staff Ali Aslan, left. \n \n Assad talked wistfully about his desire to finish his father\u2019s peace negotiations with Israel. He said he wanted to be a \u201cgood neighbor\u201d in the region. He said he was intending to pull all Syrian troops out of Lebanon in the next few months\u2014a statement immediately contradicted by his own government but which turned out to be true. As I was leaving, he said, \u201cSend this message: I am not Saddam Hussein. I want to cooperate.\u201d \n \n That man\u2014that slightly overwhelmed prisoner of the palace\u2014seems very different from the Bashar Assad we\u2019ve come to know. He is unquestionably Michael now. His brother-in-law, the intelligence director Shawkat, was killed in a Damascus bombing in 2012; his younger brother Maher was severely injured in another bombing. Bashar stands alone in the rubble, presiding over a regime that has surpassed the brutality of his father\u2019s by orders of magnitude\u2014an estimated 126,000 dead; more than 1,000, including over 400 children, killed by chemical weapons; hundreds of thousands wounded; more than 2 million refugees fled to neighboring countries. \u201cHe\u2019s much worse than his father,\u201d says Leslie Gelb, president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cHe has killed relentlessly and without any attempt to reconcile with his opponents. He seems to believe that if he just keeps killing them, they will eventually give up.\u201d \n \n Shrewdness and Savagery \n \n It appears to be working. The tide has turned his way in the civil war that began in the Arab Spring of 2011. He has survived, even though the bulk of the world\u2014except for Iran, Russia and China\u2014\u00adwanted to see him deposed after his Aug. 21, 2013, chemical attack on the Sunni suburbs of East Damascus. He survived because, unlike Saddam, he had a very precise sense of his own mortality, a very precise sense of the steps needed to placate the U.S. and ensure his survival. In the process, he made Barack Obama seem irresolute and foolish, an American President who threatened military action, then backed down, then threatened again\u2014before finally agreeing to a Russian-\u00adinitiated deal to get rid of the \u00adSyrian chemical stockpile. There was great skepticism that Assad would actually \u00adcooperate in this process, but he had made several very clear-eyed military and political calculations of the sort that eluded Saddam and most of the other myopic despots in the region. He knew that if he didn\u2019t adhere to the deal, Obama would have no choice but to obliterate the Syrian air force\u2014and Assad needed the air force far more than he needed the chemical weapons; it was his primary enforcement mechanism in his war against the rebels. He also realized that by agreeing to the deal, the Obama Administration would tacitly acknowledge his legitimacy as the leader of Syria. The U.S. and the rest of the world would have to negotiate with him over the terms of the disposal. It was a move that would have made Michael Corleone proud. ||||| Correction appended, Dec. 16, 2013 \n \n Edith Windsor\u2019s living room is filled with mementos of a battle she never expected to wage. Growing up gay in America, Windsor, now 84, mostly kept a low profile with her sexuality beyond a vibrant circle of friends. But when her spouse Thea Spyer died in 2009, it triggered a series of events that prompted Windsor to fight for her rights in the U.S. Supreme Court\u2014a fight that concluded with a landmark victory for gay marriage this year. \n \n And so the modest Greenwich Village apartment that Windsor and Spyer shared for more than 30 years now houses trophies alongside relics of the rich life they led together. Near a framed copy of the couple\u2019s New York Times wedding announcement, there\u2019s a photograph of \u00adMichelle Obama stooping to give Windsor a tight congratulatory hug. From a pile of thank-you letters she has received, Windsor pulls out a note written in green felt-tip marker by Grace, age 9, thanking her for making it possible for her parents to marry. In her hallway is a piece of artwork with a note from lesbian cartoonist Alison Bechdel that reads, \u201cFor Edith! Thank you for \u00adpaving the way.\u201d \n \n Robert Maxwell for TIME \n \n Windsor\u2019s judicial odyssey began in 2010, when she sued the government for a $363,053 refund of the estate taxes she had to pay when her spouse died. Under the Defense of Marriage Act, a federal law passed in 1996, the couple\u2019s legal marriage in Canada in 2007 didn\u2019t qualify them for any federal protections, including the estate-tax exemption for surviving spouses. When the Supreme Court decided 5-4 in Windsor\u2019s favor on June 26, it declared \u00adDOMA\u2014which excluded gay married couples from some 1,100 federal provisions, like filing joint tax returns and accessing veterans\u2019 benefits\u2014\u00adunconstitutional. The decision marked the first time the U.S. recognized marriage between partners of the same sex. It was a big win. \n \n Windsor now finds herself transformed into an icon of the gay-rights movement. She wears the mantle well. Feisty, funny and extroverted, Windsor has been, at different points in her life, a leader. At 13 she was elected vice president of her eighth-grade class. In the 1960s and early \u201970s, after developing a precocious expertise in computer programming at IBM, she managed (at times reluctant) men. The homes she shared with Spyer in New York City and the Hamptons were salons for many people in the gay and lesbian community. The couple\u2019s love and tenacity \u201cempowered the rest of us as we were coming up,\u201d says historian and friend Blanche Wiesen Cook. \n \n But like almost all gay people in her generation, Windsor lived a double life. \u201cMost of us have spent most of our lives coming out selectively. It\u2019s safe here. It\u2019s good here. You can say you have a wife here, but not there,\u201d she says. Though she had always been quietly supportive in the gay community, generous with her time and money, she had not been\u2014in the most literal meaning of the word\u2014an activist. \n \n Her case, of course, has changed that. \u201cI can\u2019t be more out,\u201d she says joyfully. \n \n A Happy Childhood \n \n Edith Windsor, who has always been called Edie, was born in 1929, the youngest of three, to James and Celia Schlain, immigrants from Russia who owned and lived above a candy and ice cream store in a poor part of Philadelphia. When Windsor was 2, the store was quarantined after she and her brother got polio. Her parents lost the store and their house. Despite this, \u00adEdie was sheltered from the \u00adDepression\u2014her father took a hard-boiled-egg sandwich to work every day for lunch so he could buy books, and little Edie read voraciously. (She still has in her apartment the 19-volume dictionary her father used to learn English.) She was not sheltered from anti-Semitism. Her mother taught her that if a boy called her \u201ca dirty Jew,\u201d she should pull his hair and run home. \n \n The family moved to a middle-class neighborhood because her mother wanted her daughters to meet the right boys. Edie began high school during the war and had dates with boys \u201cevery Saturday night of my life.\u201d Looking back, Windsor says, she had crushes on girls, but homo\u00adsexuality wasn\u2019t a concept she thought about or applied to herself then. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know about it,\u201d she remembers. \u201cThe first time I became aware, I was at a [college] party with a boy and I was in the kitchen, and the hostess came in and said, \u2018Do you have homosexual relations?\u2019 And I pulled myself together, and I said, \u2018On occasion.\u2019 I never had.\u201d \n \n During her time in college, which she started in 1946, Windsor\u2019s awareness grew. By chance, she was assigned to write a paper on the 1948 Kinsey report, which argued that homosexuality was more prevalent than previously thought. She fell in love with a girl\u2014a classmate at Temple University\u2014for the first time. \u201cIt was both wonderful and terrible,\u201d she says. Their romantic relationship caused Edie to break off her engagement to a man. But then, deciding that she didn\u2019t want to live life as a gay person, Edith reconciled with him. They eventually married. \u201cIn the context of the homophobia that was so prevalent in the 1950s,\u201d she wrote in her sworn affidavit to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, \u201cI certainly didn\u2019t want to be a \u2018queer.\u2019 Instead, I wanted to live a \u2018normal\u2019 life.\u201d ||||| Illustration by Bryan Drury for TIME; Photo reference: Alessandra Tarantino / AP \n \n To read about TIME\u2019s choice in Spanish and Portuguese, click below. \n \n EL ELEGIDO: El Papa Francisco es la Persona del A\u00f1o 2013 de TIME \n \n A Escolha: O Papa Francisco \u00e9 a Personalidade do Ano eleita pela Time em 2013 \n \n On the edge of Buenos Aires is a nothing little street called Pasaje C, a shot of dried mud leading into a slum from what passes for a main road, the garbage-strewn Mariano Acosta. There is a church, the Immaculate Virgin, toward the end of the \u00adpasaje\u2014Spanish for passage\u2014where, on one occasion, the local priest and a number of frightened residents took refuge deep in the sanctuary when rival drug gangs opened fire. Beyond the church, Pasaje C branches into the rest of the parish: more rutted mud and cracked concrete form Pasajes A to K. Brick chips from the hasty construction of squatter housing coagulate along what ought to be sidewalks. The word asesino\u2014\u00admurderer\u2014is scrawled in spray-paint on the sooty wall of a burned-out house, which was torched just days before in retaliation for yet another shooting. Packs of dogs sprawl beneath wrecked cars. Children wander heedless of traffic, because nothing can gather speed on these jagged roads. But even Pasaje C can lead to Rome. \n \n As Cardinal and Archbishop of Buenos Aires, a metropolis of some 13.5 million souls, Jorge Mario Bergoglio made room in his schedule every year for a pastoral visit to this place of squalor and sorrow.\u00ad He would walk to the subway station nearest to the Metropolitan Cathedral, whose pillars and dome fit easily into the center of Argentine power. Traveling alone, he would transfer onto a graffiti-blasted tram to Mariano Acosta, reaching where the subways do not go. He finished the journey on foot, moving heavily in his bulky black orthopedic shoes along Pasaje C. On other days, there were other journeys to barrios throughout the city\u2014so many in need of so much, but none too poor or too filthy for a visit from this itinerant prince of the church. Reza por m\u00ed, he asked almost everyone he met. Pray for me. \n \n When, on March 13, Bergoglio inherited the throne of St. Peter\u2014keeper of the keys to the kingdom of heaven\u2014he made the same request of the world. Pray for me. His letter of retirement, a requirement of all bishops 75 and older, was already on file in a Vatican office, awaiting approval. Friends in Argentina had perceived him to be slowing down, like a spent force. In an instant, he was a new man, calling himself Francis after the humble saint from Assisi. As Pope, he was suddenly the sovereign of Vatican City and head of an institution so \u00adsprawling\u2014with about enough followers to populate China\u2014so steeped in order, so snarled by bureaucracy, so vast in its charity, so weighted by its scandals, so polarizing to those who study its teachings, so mysterious to those who don\u2019t, that the gap between him and the daily miseries of the world\u2019s poor might finally have seemed unbridgeable. Until the 266th Supreme Pontiff walked off in those clunky shoes to pay his hotel bill. \n \n The papacy is mysterious and magical: it turns a septuagenarian into a superstar while revealing almost nothing about the man himself. And it raises hopes in every corner of the world\u2014hopes that can never be fulfilled, for they are irreconcilable. The elderly traditionalist who pines for the old Latin Mass and the devout young woman who wishes she could be a priest both have hopes. The ambitious monsignor in the Vatican Curia and the evangelizing deacon in a remote Filipino village both have hopes. No Pope can make them all happy at once. \n \n (MORE: Behind the Pope Francis Cover) \n \n But what makes this Pope so important is the speed with which he has captured the imaginations of millions who had given up on hoping for the church at all. People weary of the endless parsing of sexual ethics, the buck-passing infighting over lines of authority when all the while (to borrow from Milton), \u201cthe hungry Sheep look up, and are not fed.\u201d In a matter of months, Francis has elevated the healing mission of the church\u2014the church as servant and comforter of hurting people in an often harsh world\u2014above the doctrinal police work so important to his recent predecessors. John Paul II and Benedict XVI were professors of theology. Francis is a former janitor, nightclub bouncer, chemical technician and literature teacher. \n \n And behind his self-effacing facade, he is a very canny operator. He makes masterly use of 21st century tools to perform his 1st century office. He is photographed washing the feet of female convicts, posing for selfies with young visitors to the Vatican, embracing a man with a deformed face. He is quoted saying of women who consider abortion because of poverty or rape, \u201cWho can remain unmoved before such painful situations?\u201d Of gay people: \u201cIf a homosexual person is of good will and is in search of God, I am no one to judge.\u201d To divorced and remarried Catholics who are, by rule, forbidden from taking Communion, he says that this crucial rite \u201cis not a prize for the perfect but a powerful medicine and nourishment for the weak.\u201d \n \n Through these conscious and skillful evocations of moments in the ministry of Jesus, as recounted in the Gospels, this new Pope may have found a way out of the 20th century culture wars, which have left the church moribund in much of Western Europe and on the defensive from Dublin to Los Angeles. But the paradox of the papacy is that each new man\u2019s success is burdened by the astonishing successes of Popes past. The weight of history, of doctrines and dogmas woven intricately century by century, genius by genius, is both the source and the limitation of papal power. It radiates from every statue, crypt and hand-painted vellum text in Rome\u2014and in churches, libraries, hospitals, universities and museums around the globe. A Pope sets his own course only if he can conform it to paths already chosen. \n \n And so Francis signals great change while giving the same answers to the uncomfortable questions. On the question of female priests: \u201cWe need to work harder to develop a profound theology of the woman.\u201d Which means: no. No to abortion, because an individual life begins at conception. No to gay marriage, because the male-female bond is established by God. \u201cThe teaching of the church \u2026 is clear,\u201d he has said, \u201cand I am a son of the church, but\u201d\u2014and here he adds his prayer for himself\u2014\u201cit is not necessary to talk about those issues all the time.\u201d \n \n If that prayer should be answered, if somehow by his own vivid example Francis could bring the church into a new relationship with its critics and dissidents\u2014agreeing to disagree about issues that divide them while cooperating in the urgent mission of spreading mercy\u2014he might unleash untold good. \u201cArgue less, accomplish more\u201d could be a healing motto for our times. We have a glut of problems to tackle. Francis says by example, Stop bickering and roll up your sleeves. Don\u2019t let the perfect be the enemy of the good\u2014an important thing for the world to hear, especially from a man who holds an office deemed infallible. \n \n Francesco Zizola / NOOR for TIME Thousands turn out in Rome to greet Francis during his biweekly audiences. \n \n See more photos of the Pope made for Person of the Year on LightBox . \n \n A Changing Papacy \n \n This papacy begins with a name. Jorge Bergoglio is the first Pope to choose as his namesake Francis of Assisi, the 13th century patron saint of the poor. The choice, coming after 14 Clements, 16 Benedicts and 21 Johns, is clearly and pointedly personal. The 13th century Francis turned to the ministry when, as legend has it, he heard a voice calling to him from a crucifix to repair God\u2019s house. He left his prosperous silk-merchant family to live with the poor. He was a peacemaker, the first Catholic leader to travel to Egypt to try to end the Crusades. He placed mercy at the core of his life. \n \n From that name follows much of Francis\u2019 agenda. While the Catholic Church envisioned by Benedict XVI was one of tightly calibrated spiritual prescriptions, Francis told Father Antonio Spadaro, editor of the Jesuit magazine Civilt\u00e0 Cattolica, in an interview published at the end of September, that he sees \u201cthe church as a field hospital after battle.\u201d His vision is of a pastoral\u2014not a doctrinaire\u2014church, and that will shift the Holy See\u2019s energies away from demanding long-distance homage and toward ministry to and embrace of the poor, the spiritually broken and the lonely. He expanded on this idea in a 288-section apostolic exhortation called \u201cEvangelii Gaudium,\u201d or \u201cThe Joy of the Gospel.\u201d \u201cI prefer a Church which is bruised, hurting and dirty because it has been out on the streets, rather than a Church which is unhealthy from being confined and from clinging to its own security,\u201d he wrote. He made it clear that he does not just want talk\u2014he wants actual transformation. \n \n He has halted the habit of granting priests the honorific title of monsignor as a way to stem careerism in the ranks and put the focus instead on pastoring. He told a gathering of his diplomats that he wanted them to identify candidates for bishop in their home countries who are, he said, \u201cgentle, patient and merciful, animated by inner poverty, the freedom of the Lord and also by outward simplicity and austerity of life.\u201d To Francis, poverty isn\u2019t simply about charity; it\u2019s also about justice. The church, by extension, should not reflect Rome; it should mirror the poor. \n \n Which helps explain why he has turned the once obscure Vatican Almoner, an agency that has been around for about 800 years and is often reserved for an aging Catholic diplomat, over to the dynamic 50-year-old Polish Archbishop Konrad Krajewski and told him to make it the Holy See\u2019s new front porch. \u201cYou can sell your desk,\u201d Francis told Krajewski. \u201cYou don\u2019t need it. You need to get out of the Vatican. Don\u2019t wait for people to come ringing. You need to go out and look for the poor.\u201d The Archbishop hands out small amounts to the needy, including a recent gift of 1,600 phone cards to immigrant survivors of a capsized boat so they could call family back in Eritrea. Francis often gives Krajewski stacks of letters with his instructions to help the people who have written to him and asked for aid. In what sounds like a necessary precaution, the Vatican recently issued a denial after Krajewski hinted that Francis himself sometimes slips out of the Vatican dressed as an ordinary priest to hand out alms. ||||| In 2013, the audacious upstart shut down the government on a hopeless quest to stop the President's signature policy. Love him or hate him, he is a vision of the future \n \n Marco Grob for TIME \n \n They don\u2019t teach this stuff in eighth-grade civics class: a freshman U.S. senator from the minority party provokes a shutdown of the federal government in a hopeless quest to undo the President\u2019s signature legislative achievement. The nation flirts with a potentially disastrous default while the populace looks on in disgust. And when the instigator tries to explain himself during one of the longest speeches in Senate history, somehow he ends up reciting Dr. Seuss\u2019s Green Eggs and Ham. \n \n The faux filibuster to \u201cdefund Obama\u00adcare\u201d waged by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas made him so unpopular with his fellow Republicans (Democrats scarcely concealed their delight) that they might have made him walk the plank\u2014except that the GOP\u2019s approval ratings were sinking so fast that even the plank was underwater. \n \n Plus, anyone steeped in Washington politics could see that Cruz was already dead from this massive self-inflicted wound. \n \n But to Cruz, 42, that is precisely the reason he believes he is winning. The young barn burner is convinced that \u201cofficial Washington\u201d\u2014his umbrella term covering the old guard of both \u00adparties\u2014is hopelessly out of touch with the voters, so he wears the scorn like a crown of laurel. If the Establishment says he\u2019s finished, he concludes, he must be making headway. If they\u2019re so sure he\u2019s wrong, he must be doing something right. \n \n \u201cChanging Washington isn\u2019t easy, and we shouldn\u2019t be surprised when official Washington fights back,\u201d he told Time in an end-of-year interview. \u201cPeople who were used to making decisions in smoky rooms behind closed doors don\u2019t know how to operate in today\u2019s world, where people have direct access to information, can form their own opinions and know how to make their views heard.\u201d \n \n TIME Graphic by Chris Wilson, Sam Jacobs & Alexander Ho",

Read the latest news about the protest here. \n \n ------ \n \n This story was originally posted at 1:47 p.m. Monday: \n \n Tractor-trailer drivers will intentionally clog the inner loop of the Washington, D.C., beltway beginning on the morning of Oct. 11, according to a coordinator of the upcoming \"Truckers Ride for the Constitution\" rally. \n \n Organizers of the three-day ride want to call attention to a litany of trucker frustrations and express their disapproval of national political leaders. \n \n Earl Conlon, a Georgia trucker who is handling logistics for the protest, told U.S. News tractor-trailer drivers will circle the beltway \"three lanes deep\" as he rides with other participants to Congress to seek the arrest of congressmen for allegedly disregarding the Constitution. \n \n The truckers circling I-495 will keep the left lane open for emergency vehicles, Conlon said, but \"everybody that doesn't have a supporter sticker on their window, good luck: Nobody in, nobody out.\" The trucks will be going the 55 mile-per-hour speed limit. \n \n D.C. commuters who wish to be allowed past the convoy must have \"T2SDA\" \u2013 an acronym for the event's original name, \"Truckers to Shut Down America\" \u2013 written on their vehicle, he said. \n \n \"It's going to be real fun for anyone who is not a supporter,\" Conlon said, \"[and] if cops decide to give us a hard time, we're going to lock the brakes up, we're going to stop right there, we're going to be a three lane roadblock.\" \n \n Zeeda Andrews, a former country music singer helping promote the protest, said last week participants would present demands to congressmen \u2013 including the impeachment of President Barack Obama \u2013 and give the congressmen an opportunity to agree to the demands in exchange for canceling the ride. \n \n But Conlon says that's not quite right. \n \n \"We are not going to ask for impeachment,\" Conlon said. \"We are coming whether they like it or not. We're not asking for impeachment, we're asking for the arrest of everyone in government who has violated their oath of office.\" \n \n Conlon cited the idea of a citizens grand jury \u2013 meaning a pool of jurors convened without court approval \u2013 as the mechanism for indicting the officials. \n \n \"We want these people arrested, and we're coming in with the grand jury to do it,\" he said. \"We are going to ask the law enforcement to uphold their constitutional oath and make these arrests. If they refuse to do it, by the power of the people of the United States and the people's grand jury, they don't want to do it, we will. ... We the people will find a way.\" \n \n It's almost certain that anyone attempting to \"arrest\" a member of Congress would be arrested themselves for attempted kidnapping. \n \n Conlon and Andrews say Obama committed \"treason\" by allegedly funneling weapons to al-Qaida-linked rebels in Syria. Members of Congress who support arming Syrian rebels, Conlon said, are accessories to the alleged crime. He identified House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., as politicians he will seek to arrest for alleged acts against the Constitution. \n \n Andrews said last week 3,000 truckers had RSVP-ed to the event, and Conlon says he's now lost count of the number. He says he's receiving around 100 emails a day from prospective participants. \n \n \"What we want to do is go in nice and peaceful and keep it as peaceful as possible... but if they decide to get ugly with us we're going to do what we have to do,\" he said. \"If all I get is one or two congressmen walked out of there in handcuffs, that will be a shot across the bow that will ripple across all branches of government. ... I hope they are all civil enough and brave enough to step out onto the congressional steps.\" \n \n Trucker-specific grievances behind the protest include Environmental Protection Agency fuel efficiency standards and the high cost of diesel fuel. State and local anti-idling laws as well as insurance companies purportedly requiring technological updates are among the irritations, as is the perceived deterioration of Fourth Amendment rights protecting truckers' cabs. \n \n Whether or not the truckers pack a punch to D.C. area traffic depends on the number and intensity level of participants. A similar three-day protest in 2007, against illegal immigration and competition from Mexican truckers, did not spoil commutes as feared, the Washington Examiner reported. A Facebook page advertising the upcoming ride has close to 50,000 likes. \n \n Watch: Bikers head toward D.C. on Sept. 11: \n \n More News: \n \n Updated on Oct. 8, 2013 : An update has been attached to this article.",

    "document": "Photo \n \n Many teenagers who never would have smoked cigarettes are now \u201cvaping\u201d with flavored e-cigarettes, leading to a new generation using nicotine at rates not seen since the 1990s, a new study suggests. \n \n The study, released Monday in the journal Pediatrics, tracked the use of cigarettes and e-cigarettes among 5,490 California high school seniors who graduated between 1995 and 2014. E-cigarettes do not burn tobacco, but are battery-operated inhalers that heat up and vaporize liquid containing flavors and nicotine, a practice known as vaping. The liquids used in vaping range in taste from traditional tobacco and menthol flavors to fruity and sweet combinations like gummi bear, banana bread and cotton candy. \n \n When e-cigarettes came on the market in 2007, some public health experts hoped that they would serve as a substitute for traditional tobacco products and lead to declines in tobacco use. \n \n But the data from the latest study, conducted by researchers at the University of Southern California, tell a different story. E-cigarettes do not appear to have made a dent in regular cigarette use \u2014 the number of high school seniors who reported smoking tobacco in the past 30 days has largely plateaued. In 2004, the number of 12th graders who reported smoking tobacco in the past 30 days was 9 percent; in 2014 that number was just under 8 percent. \n \n But the rate of teenagers using nicotine \u2014 either through tobacco cigarettes or e-cigarettes \u2014 is on the rise. About 14 percent of Southern California high school seniors in 2014 said they had smoked or vaped in the last 30 days. Researchers say they have not seen similar levels of nicotine use among teenagers since 1995, when 12th-grade smoking rates were 19 percent. \n \n The numbers suggest that rather than prompting teenagers to replace cigarette smoking with vaping, e-cigarettes instead have enticed an entirely new group of teenagers to use nicotine. While the study focused on California teenagers, researchers say the numbers are consistent with national trends. \n \n \u201cKids are not just using e-cigarettes instead of cigarettes. That is what we were frankly hoping to find,\u201d said Jessica Barrington-Trimis, the lead author of the study and a postdoctoral scholar research associate in the department of preventive medicine at the U.S.C. Keck School of Medicine. All of the teenagers that were expected to be using cigarettes in 2014 are using them, she said, \u201cand then there is a whole group of kids using e-cigarettes on top of that.\u201d \n \n The amount of nicotine in the liquids used with e-cigarettes \u2014 often called \u201cvape juice\u201d \u2014 varies, and users can purchase liquid with no nicotine or nicotine content ranging from 3 milligrams per milliliter to 18 milligrams per milliliter or even higher. While earlier studies have suggested that some teens are using nicotine-free vaping liquids, researchers say the majority of teens appear to be using nicotine-infused liquid in their e-cigarettes. \n \n Dr. Jonathan Winickoff, professor of pediatrics at MassGeneral Hospital for Children and Harvard Medical School, who wrote an accompanying paper in Pediatrics, said this is the first study of e-cigarette use in adolescents to show such a strong longitudinal sample with such a drastic effect. \n \n \u201cWe had a trend of decreasing nicotine use,\u201d said Dr. Winickoff. \u201cWhat the e-cigarette has done is halted that decrease in its tracks\u2026. We don\u2019t want a fifth of our high school students graduating with nicotine addiction.\u201d \n \n While e-cigarettes do appear to be safer than smoking tobacco, they are not risk free. Nicotine disrupts neurotransmitter activity and is highly addictive, particularly in a developing brain. And the liquids contain solvents, formaldehyde and other ingredients that pose health risks when inhaled. \n \n While it\u2019s true that there are nicotine-free vaping liquids, the e-cigarette industry is not regulated, which makes it hard to know what ingredients are actually in any given product. Though the Food and Drug Administration recently took jurisdiction over e-cigarettes, it will be years before any regulations are put into effect. Currently, many products continue to be made in China with little \u2014 if any \u2014 oversight by the United States. \n \n \u201cThe F.D.A. has done tests on these vaping products that supposedly do and do not contain nicotine, and what is advertised is really not what\u2019s in the product,\u201d Dr. Winickoff said. \u201cWhen the product is labeled as no nicotine, they\u2019ve found nicotine. So kids don\u2019t know what they\u2019re getting, and as a pediatrician it really scares me.\u201d \n \n Not everyone agrees that e-cigarettes pose a significant risk to teenagers. Dr. Michael Siegel, professor of community health sciences at the Boston University School of Public Health, countered that many teenagers say they are using e-cigarettes that contain only flavorings and no nicotine, and therefore are not getting addicted. \n \n \u201cE-cigarette use among teenagers is a largely social phenomenon,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that you tend to see teenagers doing this in groups, not out in the cold vaping alone, suggests that e-cigarettes are not addictive.\u201d \n \n But there is a growing body of research showing that e-cigarettes do serve as a gateway to traditional tobacco products. Last month, the U.S.C. researchers also reported in Pediatrics that adolescents who vape are six times more likely to smoke cigarettes in early adulthood as nonusers. \n \n \u201cOnce kids get hooked on e-cigarettes, they are more likely to go on to become cigarette smokers,\u201d said Stanton A. Glantz, director of the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California, San Francisco. ||||| Abstract BACKGROUND: Adolescent e-cigarette use has increased rapidly in recent years, but it is unclear whether e-cigarettes are merely substituting for cigarettes or whether e-cigarettes are being used by those who would not otherwise have smoked. To understand the role of e-cigarettes in overall tobacco product use, we examine prevalence rates from Southern California adolescents over 2 decades. METHODS: The Children\u2019s Health Study is a longitudinal study of cohorts reaching 12th grade in 1995, 1998, 2001, 2004, and 2014. Cohorts were enrolled from entire classrooms in schools in selected communities and followed prospectively through completion of secondary school. Analyses used data from grades 11 and 12 of each cohort (N = 5490). RESULTS: Among 12th-grade students, the combined adjusted prevalence of current cigarette or e-cigarette use in 2014 was 13.7%. This was substantially greater than the 9.0% adjusted prevalence of current cigarette use in 2004, before e-cigarettes were available (P = .003) and only slightly less than the 14.7% adjusted prevalence of smoking in 2001 (P = .54). Similar patterns were observed for prevalence rates in 11th grade, for rates of ever use, and among both male and female adolescents and both Hispanic and Non-Hispanic White adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking prevalence among Southern California adolescents has declined over 2 decades, but the high prevalence of combined e-cigarette or cigarette use in 2014, compared with historical Southern California smoking prevalence, suggests that e-cigarettes are not merely substituting for cigarettes and indicates that e-cigarette use is occurring in adolescents who would not otherwise have used tobacco products. \n \n What\u2019s Known on This Subject: E-cigarette use has increased rapidly in recent years among adolescents. It is unknown whether e-cigarettes are merely substituting for cigarettes or whether e-cigarettes are increasing total adolescent tobacco product use via initiation by those who would not otherwise have smoked. \n \n What This Study Adds: The high prevalence of combined e-cigarette or cigarette use in 2014, compared with historical Southern California smoking prevalence, suggests that e-cigarette use is occurring in adolescents who would not otherwise have used tobacco products. \n \n Since the introduction of electronic cigarettes into the US market in 2007,1 adolescent use has increased rapidly, particularly in the past several years. Data from the National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS), a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of adolescents in the United States, show that current (past 30-day) use of e-cigarettes increased exponentially from 1.1% in 2011 to 16.0% in 2015 among high school students.2\u20136 While the prevalence of e-cigarette use is increasing, cigarette use is generally declining among adolescents; in the NYTS, current cigarette use among high school students fell from 15.8% in 2011 to 9.2% in 2014,2,3,5,6 continuing the decline in prevalence of cigarette use among adolescents from its most recent peak in the mid-1990s when the prevalence of current smoking reached 35%.7 Of note, the prevalence of cigarette smoking did not continue to decline from 2014 (9.2%) to 2015 (9.3%).6 In 2014, current use of e-cigarettes surpassed current cigarette use for the first time in several national studies (including the NYTS2 and the Monitoring the Future Study8), as well as in a number of local and state-level studies,9\u201311 including our study of Southern California adolescents.12 \n \n There are multiple interpretations of recent trends in e-cigarette and cigarette use among adolescents. Adolescents who otherwise would have smoked may be using e-cigarettes instead of cigarettes. Alternatively, e-cigarettes may be recruiting new users who otherwise would not have initiated cigarette use (or perhaps any other tobacco product) if e-cigarettes were not available. Recent data from the 2015 NYTS found a small, nonsignificant increase in the use of any tobacco product from 2013 to 2015 (from 22.9% to 25.3%).2,6 The increase in overall tobacco product use appears to be largely driven by increases in e-cigarette and hookah use in 2013 and 2014, and continued increases in e-cigarette use in 2015, along with no decline in cigarette smoking from 2014 to 2015.2,3 Although these data provide insight into trends over the preceding 3 years, adolescent tobacco use has declined for >20 years.7 The impact of e-cigarettes on adolescent tobacco use trends that have evolved over longer periods is unknown. \n \n We analyzed data from the Southern California Children\u2019s Health Study (CHS), a prospective study of 5 cohorts reaching 12th grade in 1995, 1998, 2001, 2004, and 2014, to describe patterns of smoking among adolescents across these years. On the basis of historical data on smoking initiation over the course of adolescence in these cohorts, we compared the rate of total e-cigarette or cigarette use in 2014 to the rate of cigarette use in 2004 before e-cigarettes were available; we hypothesized that an increase from this benchmark may indicate that e-cigarettes are currently being used by adolescents who would not otherwise have smoked if e-cigarettes were not available. \n \n Methods Study Sample The CHS is a prospective cohort study (1993\u2013present), originally designed to study the effects of childhood air pollution exposure.13\u201315 It comprises 5 cohorts of adolescents (Cohorts A\u2013E) who were recruited and followed through 12th grade (Table 1). Recruitment methods and data collection procedures have been described previously.12\u201315 Briefly, participants were enrolled from entire classrooms in schools in selected communities in Southern California12,14 in 10th grade (Cohort A, 1993), seventh grade (Cohort B, 1993), fourth grade (Cohort C, 1993 and Cohort D, 1996), kindergarten (Cohort E1, 2003), or first grade (Cohort E2, 2003). The current analysis uses available data from grades 11 and 12 of each cohort from participants who answered questions about tobacco product use (N = 5490; 11th grade: mean age [SD] = 16.9 [0.4]; 12th grade: mean age [SD] = 17.9 [0.4]. In Cohorts A through D, history of cigarette use was collected by in-person interview every year at schools as they were followed over time.15,16 Among participants in Cohorts A through D with data available from 11th or 12th grade, 85.7% of the sample provided information on smoking history in both 11th and 12th grades and therefore contributed to prevalence estimates in both years; 10.6% contributed to 11th grade analyses only and 3.7% contributed to 12th grade analyses only. In Cohorts E1 and E2, who were separated by 1 grade, smoking history was collected every other year, so both 11th- and 12th-grade subjects were included in the 2014 survey. In 2014, smoking history in Cohorts E1 and E2 was collected by self-administered questionnaires under study staff supervision. Cohort A through D subjects were all recruited from the same 12 communities; Cohorts E1 and E2 were recruited from 13 communities, of which 12 participated in the 2014 data collection and 8 were the same as Cohorts A through D. TABLE 1 Grade of Adolescents Included in Each Cohort in Each Year of the CHS, 1994\u20132014 Ethics Statement The study was approved by the University of Southern California Institutional Review Board. Written informed consent was obtained before data collection. Cigarette and E-Cigarette Use In all CHS cohorts, participants were asked the number of cigarettes or packs of cigarettes that they had smoked in the past 24 hours, past week, past month, past year, and in their lifetime. In each year, participants were classified as current users if they reported smoking \u22651 cigarettes in the past 24 hours, past week, or past month; participants were classified as ever users if they reported either (1) use in the past year or in their lifetime or (2) listed an age at which they had first smoked. This classification was used for all prevalence estimates of cigarette use alone, across all cohorts. In 2014, smoking history was assessed in Cohort E participants (in grades 11 and 12) using the same question as in Cohorts A through D, along with 2 additional questions that asked about the age at which each participant had first used a cigarette (\u201ceven 1 or 2 puffs\u201d) and the number of days smoked in the past 30 days. In addition, use of e-cigarettes was assessed for the first time using the new questions. Adolescents who had used cigarettes or e-cigarettes on at least 1 of the past 30 days were classified as \u201ccurrent users\u201d of that product. \u201cEver users\u201d were adolescents who reported having ever tried a product. Analyses evaluating combined product use of cigarettes or e-cigarettes in Cohorts E1 and E2 were based on responses to the new questions. The prevalence rates both for current and ever cigarette use were quite similar using either set of questions, differing by 0.1% for current use and 1.6% for prevalence of ever smoking, and the results of analyses were not substantively different using either set of questions. Therefore, in Cohort E we used the prevalence rates derived from the new questions about cigarette use, which we have reported previously12 and which were common to those used to assess e-cigarette prevalence rates. Statistical Analysis Prevalence estimates for ever and current cigarette use were calculated by cohort and grade, using the questionnaire items assessed across all cohorts. In Cohort E (in 2014), we calculated the combined prevalence of cigarette or e-cigarette use (ever or current), which included adolescents who reported use of either product or dual use of both products. Logistic regression models were used to estimate smoking prevalence for each cohort by grade, with adjustment for self-reported sex, ethnicity (Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, or other), and parental education (less than high school education, high school graduate, some college, college degree, some graduate school or higher, unknown/missing). Adjusted models were used to account for the different distribution across cohorts of socioeconomic factors known to be associated with cigarette use. These models were applied separately to current smoking and ever smoking. The distributions of sex, ethnicity, and parental education in Cohort E were used as the reference for calculating the adjusted prevalence estimates from the logistic model. Logistic regression models were also used to evaluate trends in the prevalence of cigarette use (ever or current) over calendar time, by including year of data collection as a continuous predictor variable in separate analyses by grade. Logistic regression models with an interaction term were used to evaluate whether the pattern of cigarette use across cohorts varied by ethnicity or sex. In analyses to assess the sensitivity of results to the participation of different Southern California communities in different cohorts, we additionally restricted analyses to the 8 communities common to all years of all cohorts and adjusted for community. The Statistical Analysis System (SAS, version 9.4) was used for analyses, and figures were created using Stata, version 13.1. All hypothesis testing was conducted assuming a .05 significance level. \n \n Results Demographic characteristics for each cohort are shown in Table 2. The earlier cohorts (A\u2013D) included a greater proportion of non-Hispanic white adolescents (54%\u201359%), whereas Cohorts E1 and E2 included more Hispanic adolescents (49%\u201353%). The distributions of the highest level of parental education differed among the cohorts. TABLE 2 Demographic Characteristics of Participants Enrolled in the CHS, by Cohort, 1994\u20132014, N = 5490 The adjusted prevalence of current smoking among high school students decreased over time from 1995 to 2014 in both 11th and 12th grades (P trend < .0001; Fig 1 A and B). Among 12th-grade students in Cohort A (1995), the adjusted prevalence of current smoking was 19.1%; prevalence of use decreased to 17.1% in Cohort B (1998), 14.7% in Cohort C (2001), 9.0% in Cohort D (2004), and 7.8% in Cohort E (2014). Although the prevalence of current cigarette use was lowest among students in both grades in 2014, the combined prevalence of current cigarette and/or e-cigarette use was similar to or greater than that for cigarette use alone 10 to 15 years ago, before e-cigarettes were available (Fig 1 A and B). For example, among 12th-grade students, the adjusted prevalence of combined use of either product in 2014 was 13.7% (3.8% dual users of cigarettes and e-cigarettes, 3.9% cigarette only users, and 6.0% e-cigarette only users), which was similar to the 14.7% prevalence of cigarette use in 2001 (P = .54), and nearly 5 percentage points higher than the adjusted prevalence of current cigarette use in 2004 (9.0%; P = .003). FIGURE 1 Adjusted prevalence estimates among adolescents in the CHS by cohort for current cigarette use (all cohorts), and current cigarette or e-cigarette use (Cohort E) in (A) grade 11 and (B) grade 12 and for ever cigarette use (all cohorts) and ever cigarette or e-cigarette use (Cohort E) in (C) grade 11 and (D) grade 12, 1994\u20132014. The prevalence of ever cigarette use followed similar patterns of an overall decrease over time across Cohort A (1994\u20131995) to Cohort E (2014) for both 11th- and 12th-grade students (P trend < .0001; Fig 1 C and D). However, the 11th- and 12th-grade prevalence rates for ever cigarette use in 2014 were not statistically significantly lower than the prevalence in Cohort D 10 years earlier in 2003\u20132004 (P = .59, 0.56, respectively). The prevalence of combined ever use of cigarettes or e-cigarettes also surpassed rates of ever cigarette use more than a decade ago. Among 12th-grade students, the adjusted prevalence of ever use of either cigarettes or e-cigarettes in 2014 was 32.1%, substantially higher than the adjusted prevalence of ever cigarette use in 2004 (20.4%; P < .0001), and slightly higher than the adjusted prevalence in 2001 (30.2%; P = .41). Among both male and female adolescents, the prevalence of cigarette or e-cigarette use (ever or current) in both 11th and 12th grades in 2014 was higher than the prevalence of smoking in 2003\u20132004 and was generally similar to the prevalence of smoking in 2000\u20132001 (Fig 2 A\u2013D). There was no difference between sexes in these patterns of decline in smoking over time (interaction P > .05). The prevalence of current and ever use of cigarettes within cohorts was higher among male than among female adolescents, with more pronounced differences observed among 12th-grade students; combined rates of e-cigarette or cigarette use in 2014 were also larger in male than female adolescents. FIGURE 2 Prevalence estimates among adolescents in the CHS by cohort and sex for current cigarette use (all cohorts) and current cigarette or e-cigarette use (Cohort E) in (A) grade 11 and (B) grade 12 and for ever cigarette use (all cohorts) and ever cigarette or e-cigarette use (Cohort E) in (C) grade 11 and (D) grade 12, 1994\u20132014. The prevalence of current and ever smoking also decreased over time from 1994 to 2014 among both non-Hispanic white adolescents and Hispanic adolescents (P < .0001; Fig 3 A\u2013D; interaction P for ethnicity >.05). In both ethnic groups, the combined prevalence of current cigarette or e-cigarette use in 2014 exceeded the rate of current cigarette use in 2003 (11th grade) or 2004 (12th grade). For example, among non-Hispanic white 12th-grade students, the combined rate of current cigarette or e-cigarette use in 2014 in Cohort E was identical to the rate of smoking in 2001 (17.2%; 5.0% dual use, 4.4% cigarette only use, 7.8% e-cigarette only use); the rate of combined use among Hispanic white adolescents in 2014 (12.0%; 2.9% dual use, 5.0% cigarette only use, 4.1% e-cigarette only use) was >3 percentage points higher than the rate of smoking in 2004 (8.8%) and only slightly less than the rate of smoking in 2001 (13.8%). Similar patterns were observed for ever use in both ethnicities; the combined rate of cigarette or e-cigarette use in 2014 in 11th- and 12th-grade students was higher than the rates of smoking 10 years earlier in both ethnic groups. We did observe differences in rates of smoking within cohorts between Hispanic and non-Hispanic white study participants. Current smoking prevalence was consistently higher among non-Hispanic white adolescents than among Hispanic white adolescents (Fig 3 A and B), but ever use was generally similar or modestly higher among Hispanic white adolescents than among non-Hispanic white adolescents (Fig 3 C and D). In 2014 the combined prevalence of e-cigarette or cigarette use (both current and ever) was greater in Hispanic whites than non-Hispanic whites in 11th grade, which appears to result from higher prevalence of cigarette only use (dual and e-cigarette only use was similar across both groups). In 12th grade, the combined prevalence of e-cigarette or cigarette use was greater in non-Hispanic whites than Hispanic white youth, largely resulting from greater levels of e-cigarette and dual product use. FIGURE 3 Prevalence estimates among adolescents in the CHS by cohort and by ethnicity for current cigarette use (all cohorts), and current cigarette or e-cigarette use (Cohort E) in (A) grade 11 and (B) grade 12 and for ever cigarette use (all cohorts) and ever cigarette or e-cigarette use (Cohort E) in (C) grade 11 and (D) grade 12, 1994\u20132014. HW, Hispanic white; NHW, non-Hispanic white. In analyses restricted to the 8 communities with data available across all cohorts, trends in prevalence across cohorts and across grades within cohorts, as well as the ethnic- and sex-specific patterns, were similar to those observed in the entire sample (data not shown). \n \n Discussion These Southern California communities have experienced a marked decrease in adolescent cigarette use over the past 2 decades. However, among both 11th- and 12th-grade students, the combined prevalence of current cigarette or e-cigarette use in 2014 was substantially greater than the prevalence of smoking in 2004 (among 12th graders, eg, 13.7% and 9.0%, respectively) and was almost as high as the prevalence of smoking in 2001 (14.7% for 12th graders). This substantially increased combined prevalence of cigarette smoking or e-cigarette use in 2014, compared with smoking rates a decade earlier, when e-cigarettes were not available, suggests that e-cigarettes are not used only by adolescents who would otherwise be smoking cigarettes. If, for example, the current rates of smoking would not have changed from 2004 to 2014 in the absence of e-cigarettes, then 1.2% of adolescents in Southern California, the difference between the 7.8% adjusted prevalence of cigarette use in 2014 and 9.0% in 2004, may be substituting e-cigarettes for cigarettes. An additional 4.7% of e-cigarette users, the difference between the 13.7% combined prevalence of e-cigarette or cigarette use in 2014 and the 9.0% prevalence of cigarette use in 2004 likely would not have used cigarettes if e-cigarettes were not available, under the assumption that the rate of smoking from 2004 to 2014 would not have changed. The assumption that smoking rates would not have decreased in the absence of e-cigarettes likely makes this estimate of the proportion of e-cigarette users who would not otherwise have used cigarettes conservative. The general prevalence patterns and the findings compared with the 2004 data were similar among Hispanic and non-Hispanic white participants and in male and female participants; thus, tobacco control interventions geared toward youth are equally needed for youth of both sexes and ethnicities. The prevalence of cigarette use or combined use (Cohort E only) did differ by gender and ethnicity within each cohort. Hispanic adolescents were less likely to report cigarette use in each cohort among both 11th- and 12th-grade students but as likely to report ever use, a pattern consistent with historically reported ethnic comparisons.3,7,17,18 Male respondents were generally more likely to report use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, or combined use of cigarettes or e-cigarettes, which is also consistent with previous literature.2,7,12,19 A major strength of this study is the use of >20 years of data collected across 5 cohorts drawn from the same CHS communities to assess patterns of change in cigarette use in Southern California. Because all results were adjusted for the Cohort E distribution of race/ethnicity, sex, and parental education, it is unlikely that differences across cohorts were influenced by changes in sociodemographic characteristics of the population over time. The study is also subject to some limitations. Data on use of tobacco products other than cigarettes were not collected from earlier cohorts. Thus, the contribution of hookah, cigar/cigarillo, pipe, or smokeless tobacco use to the prevalence of all tobacco product use in earlier cohorts is not known. Data from the NYTS have shown relatively stable prevalence of use of cigars and smokeless tobacco from 2000 to 2012,20 followed by a decrease in cigar and pipe use and in smokeless tobacco use from 2011 to 2014.2 Although national results may not be generalizable to Southern California (and vice versa), we cannot exclude the possibility that e-cigarette use is substituting for these combustible tobacco products. No data are available on trends in hookah use across the periods of interest in this study, but prevalence of hookah use increased in the NYTS from 2011 to 2014,2 so it seems unlikely that the increase in prevalence of e-cigarette use during this period reflects substitution of e-cigarettes for hookah use among participants who otherwise would have smoked hookah use in previous cohorts. Analyses were restricted to Hispanic youth (historically an underrepresented population in tobacco regulatory science research) and non-Hispanic white youth, who comprise the majority of the Southern California population; the prevalence estimates were imprecise in other racial/ethnic groups in our study, which made up <20% of the sample. Additional research is needed to determine whether similar patterns of product use over time occurred in other racial groups and in other geographic regions. E-cigarettes have gained popularity in recent years, in part because of availability in a wide variety of flavorings21 that may be appealing to adolescents and young adults,22 the perception that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking,23 absence or poor enforcement of regulations on indoor use,24 and the recent popularity of product-specific venues that encourage use of these products in social situations, such as vape shops.25 Such characteristics of e-cigarettes may be recruiting new users who are deterred from initiating cigarettes because of concerns about the health hazards of smoking and social stigmatization of cigarette use.7 There is concern that the increasing prevalence of e-cigarette use could even lead to initiation of smoking among previously nonsmoking adolescent e-cigarette users in what has been described as a \u201cgateway effect,\u201d either as a result of social normalization of alternative product use and smoking behaviors more generally, leading to renormalization of smoking or by directly increasing use of cigarettes through establishment of reward seeking behaviors (eg, nicotine dependence).26\u201330 Although our results demonstrated a decline in cigarette use in the past decade, we also have observed a markedly increased likelihood of intention to use cigarettes31 among e-cigarette users in the CHS in 2014 who had never smoked, results which are consistent with 2 recent studies examining the association of e-cigarette use with susceptibility to smoking,28,30 and recent longitudinal studies that have found that never-smoking e-cigarette users were more likely to report use of cigarettes a year later than never e-cigarette users.32\u201334 The use of e-cigarettes by nonsmoking adolescents poses several potential public health problems. First, use of e-cigarettes containing nicotine may directly contribute to nicotine dependence in late adolescence or early adulthood, putting adolescents at risk for lifelong nicotine dependence.35,36 Use of e-cigarettes, even without nicotine, may normalize tobacco product use behaviors more generally, which could then lead to increased rates of addiction via use of other nicotine-containing products, including cigarettes and other harmful combustible tobacco products.35\u201337 Second, in addition to lifelong problems associated with nicotine dependence, exposure to nicotine in adolescence adversely affects cognitive function and development.19 There is also evidence that e-cigarettes may generate aldehydes and other toxic chemicals and that flavoring additives may induce adverse respiratory health effects in e-cigarette users.38 Although the adverse health effects of e-cigarettes may be less than those of cigarettes, the long-term consequences of e-cigarette use are not known because these products have been on the market for less than a decade. \n \n Conclusions Longitudinal data on emerging adolescent tobacco and alternative tobacco product use, including detailed information on topography of e-cigarette use and dose of nicotine, are needed to understand the role of e-cigarettes in nicotine addiction and whether e-cigarette users who have not used combustible cigarettes will, in the future, continue using e-cigarettes only, quit using tobacco products altogether, or progress to combustible cigarette users or dual users of both products. However, the high combined prevalence of e-cigarette use or cigarette use in 2014, compared with historical Southern California smoking prevalence, suggests that adolescents are not merely substituting e-cigarettes for cigarettes but that e-cigarettes are instead recruiting a new group of users who would not likely have initiated combustible tobacco product use in the absence of e-cigarettes, which poses a potential threat to the public health of adolescent populations. ||||| E-Cigarettes 101 \n \n \n \n WebMD Feature By R.

But ready or not, the era of e-cigarettes is here. It\u2019s a booming, billion-dollar industry -- on track to outsell tobacco products within a decade. The number of teens and tweens using these products doubled between 2011 and 2012. \n \n The time to get informed about these products is now. \n \n How E-Cigarettes Work \n \n They look like the real thing. The end glows as you inhale. As you exhale, you puff out a cloud of what looks like smoke. It's vapor, similar to the fog you might see at rock shows, says M. Brad Drummond, MD. He's an assistant professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. \n \n All e-cigarettes work basically the same way. Inside, there's a battery, a heating element, and a cartridge that holds nicotine and other liquids and flavorings. Features and costs vary. Some are disposable. Others have a rechargeable battery and refillable cartridges. \n \n Using an e-cigarette is called \"vaping.\" \n \n Are They Safe? \n \n The nicotine inside the cartridges is addictive. When you stop using it, you can get withdrawal symptoms including feeling irritable, depressed, restless and anxious. It can be dangerous for people with heart problems. It may also harm your arteries over time. \n \n So far, evidence suggests that e-cigarettes may be safer than regular cigarettes. The biggest danger from tobacco is the smoke, and e-cigarettes don't burn. Tests show the levels of dangerous chemicals they give off are a fraction of what you'd get from a real cigarette. But what's in them can vary. \n \n \"E-cigarettes may be less harmful than cigarettes,\" Drummond says. \"But we still don't know enough about their long-term risks or the effects of secondhand exposure.\" \n \n Pro and Con \n \n E-cigarettes have triggered a fierce debate among health experts who share the same goal -- reducing the disease and death caused by tobacco. But they disagree about whether e-cigarettes make the problem better or worse. ||||| Nicotine experimentation could become nicotine addiction for youth who never used any other tobacco products, USC study suggests \n \n A new USC study debunks the popular belief that electronic cigarettes are merely a substitute for cigarettes among teens. Instead, the study suggests that some teens who never would have smoked cigarettes are now vaping. \n \n E-cigarettes, which entered the U.S. market in 2007, vaporize liquids that may or may not contain nicotine. In 2011, about 1.5 percent of high schoolers had vaped in the past 30 days, according to the National Youth Tobacco Survey. Four years later, that number skyrocketed to 16 percent. \n \n A USC study of 5,490 high school juniors and seniors shows tobacco use among teens in Southern California is on the rise. \n \n In 2014, about 14 percent of 12th-graders said they had either smoked or vaped in the previous 30 days. A decade earlier -- before e-cigarettes were sold in the United States -- 9 percent of surveyed teens in this age group reported that they had smoked, said Jessica Barrington-Trimis, lead author and a postdoctoral scholar research associate in the Department of Preventive Medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of USC. \n \n \"If teenagers who vape are using e-cigarettes instead of cigarettes, we would have expected to see the decline in smoking rates continue through 2014,\" Barrington-Trimis said. \"But what we've seen is a downward trend in cigarette use from 1995 to 2004 but no further decrease in cigarette smoking rates in 2014. The combined e-cigarette and cigarette use in 2014 far exceeded what we would have expected if teens were simply substituting cigarettes with e-cigarettes. The data suggest that at least some of the teens who are vaping would not have smoked cigarettes.\" \n \n The study, published on July 11 in the journal Pediatrics, followed five groups of high schoolers who graduated in 1995, 1998, 2001, 2004 and 2014. Researchers collected the history of tobacco use in an individually administered questionnaire. \n \n Cigarette use is the largest preventable cause of death and disease in the United States. Cigarette smoking kills more than 480,000 Americans annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control. \n \n \"An important question in the rapidly evolving landscape of youth tobacco product use is whether e-cigarettes are replacing cigarettes,\" said Rob McConnell, the study's senior author and professor of preventive medicine at Keck Medicine of USC. \"However, use of e-cigarettes by youth who would not otherwise have smoked results in exposure to the hazards of inhaled vaporized liquids and flavorings in e-cigarettes and may result in exposure to nicotine that can damage the adolescent brain.\" \n \n USC is one of 14 U.S. research institutions that received National Institutes of Health funding to establish the Tobacco Centers of Regulatory Science. \n \n What the numbers suggest \n \n The National Youth Tobacco Survey has reported a long-term decline in teen smoking rates followed by a leveling off between 2014 and 2015. \n \n The USC study found that the number of 12th-graders in Southern California who had smoked in the past 30 days dropped from 19 percent in 1995 to about 9 percent in 2004 and then leveled off, with the rate of smoking just under 8 percent in 2014. \n \n But when cigarettes and e-cigarettes were combined, some 14 percent of high school seniors in 2014 said they had smoked or vaped in the last 30 days. \n \n \"Because e-cigarettes are perceived as less harmful and less dangerous than combustible cigarettes, another concern is that teens may be introduced to nicotine use via e-cigarettes,\" Barrington-Trimis said. \"In California, where smoking rates are among the lowest in the country, the increase in vaping, possibly followed by increases in smoking, could erode the progress that has been made over the last several decades in tobacco control.\" \n \n A perilous experiment \n \n In fact, older teens who experiment with electronic cigarettes are six times more likely to try regular cigarettes within about a year when compared to those who have never vaped, reported Barrington-Trimis and her USC colleagues in a study published last month in Pediatrics. \n \n Although some e-liquid providers say their products do not contain nicotine, this industry has not been regulated until just recently. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced plans to regulate all tobacco products -- including e-cigarettes, cigars and hookah tobacco -- in May. Last month, California became the second state, behind Hawaii, to raise the age of tobacco purchase -- including e-cigarettes -- from 18 to 21. \n \n \"E-cigarettes may be recruiting a new group of kids to tobacco use,\" Barrington-Trimis said. \"E-cigarettes may be safer than regular cigarettes for adults who are transitioning from smoking to vaping, but for youth who have never used any other tobacco products, nicotine experimentation could become nicotine addiction.\" \n \n ### \n \n The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health National Cancer Institute and the Food and Drug Administration Center for Tobacco Products (P50CA180905). ||||| Abstract BACKGROUND: There has been little research examining whether e-cigarette use increases the risk of cigarette initiation among adolescents in the transition to adulthood when the sale of cigarettes becomes legal. METHODS: The Children\u2019s Health Study is a prospectively followed cohort in Southern California. Data on e-cigarette use were collected in 11th and 12th grade (mean age = 17.4); follow-up data on tobacco product use were collected an average of 16 months later from never-smoking e-cigarette users at initial evaluation (n = 146) and from a sample of never-smoking, never e-cigarette users (n = 152) frequency matched to e-cigarette users on gender, ethnicity, and grade. RESULTS: Cigarette initiation during follow-up was reported by 40.4% of e-cigarette users (n = 59) and 10.5% of never users (n = 16). E-cigarette users had 6.17 times (95% confidence interval: 3.30\u201311.6) the odds of initiating cigarettes as never e-cigarette users. Results were robust to adjustment for potential confounders and in analyses restricted to never users of any combustible tobacco product. Associations were stronger in adolescents with no intention of smoking at initial evaluation. E-cigarette users were also more likely to initiate use of any combustible product (odds ratio = 4.98; 95% confidence interval: 2.37\u201310.4), including hookah, cigars, or pipes. CONCLUSIONS: E-cigarette use in never-smoking youth may increase risk of subsequent initiation of cigarettes and other combustible products during the transition to adulthood when the purchase of tobacco products becomes legal. Stronger associations in participants with no intention of smoking suggests that e-cigarette use was not simply a marker for individuals who would have gone on to smoke regardless of e-cigarette use. \n \n What\u2019s Known on This Subject: Three studies have found associations between e-cigarette use and subsequent cigarette use in adolescents. However, the risk of initiation of cigarettes as adolescents reach an age at which the purchase of tobacco products becomes legal is unknown. \n \n What This Study Adds: Adolescents who reported e-cigarette use had more than six times the odds of initiating cigarette use as never e-cigarette users. These findings suggest e-cigarette use may increase the risk of smoking during the transition to adulthood. \n \n Adolescent use of e-cigarettes has increased rapidly in recent years,1 with several studies reporting higher rates of e-cigarette use than combustible cigarette use among high school students in 2014.1\u20136 Among high school students in the National Youth Tobacco Survey, 13.4% of adolescents reported past 30-day use of e-cigarettes in 2014, compared with 9.2% of adolescents who reported past 30-day use of cigarettes.1 Among high school students participating in the Southern California Children\u2019s Health Study (CHS), we found that 24.0% had ever tried e-cigarettes (including 9.6% who reported use in the past 30 days), compared with 18.7% who had tried cigarettes (5.7% in the past 30 days); >40% of e-cigarette users had never smoked a combustible cigarette.6 A critical question is whether e-cigarette use in adolescents who have never smoked cigarettes will lead to subsequent initiation of cigarette or other combustible product use. \n \n The initial data addressing this question came from several cross-sectional studies that examined the association between e-cigarette use and self-reported intention to use cigarettes among adolescents with no previous history of cigarette use, using validated survey measures.7\u201313 E-cigarette users, representing several age groups and geographic locations, had 2 to 4 times the odds of indicating an intention to use cigarettes as never users,7,8 results consistent with those we reported in the CHS.9 To date there have been 3 reports from prospective cohort studies examining the relationship between e-cigarette use and subsequent initiation of combustible cigarette use in adolescence, including a study of 9th-grade students (mean age 14.1),14 a second study of 9th and 10th-grade students (mean age 14.7),15 and another small study of 16- to 26-year-olds, with few never-smoking e-cigarette users at baseline that was not able to examine associations within specific developmental periods in this age range.16 All studies found that e-cigarette use was associated with elevated risk of initiation of combustible cigarettes. However, the risk of initiation of combustible cigarettes is likely to vary by age17; the developmental context of the end of high school is unique, because those turning 18 face particular challenges associated with the transition to adulthood, including postsecondary education or employment seeking, which co-occur at the age (18 years) at which the purchase of tobacco products becomes legal. \n \n We examined whether e-cigarette use among older adolescents in the transition to adulthood leads to greater likelihood of initiation of cigarettes as they reach the legal age to purchase cigarettes. We used prospective data from the CHS, a population-based cohort of adolescents from whom data on e-cigarette use were first collected in grades 11 or 12 (mean age 17.4) in spring of 2014, to examine risk of initiation of combustible tobacco products at follow-up (median 15.6 months later). We hypothesized that never-smoking e-cigarette users in this critical age range would be more likely than never-smoking never e-cigarette users to begin using combustible cigarettes during the subsequent year. \n \n Methods Study Design and Sample Participants enrolled in the CHS completed the initial evaluation questionnaire in school classrooms when they were in 11th or 12th grade. Questionnaires were completed with study staff supervision between January 2014 and June 2014, when use of e-cigarettes was first assessed in the cohort.6,18 To maximize efficiency in the design of the prospective follow-up study to evaluate the risk of cigarette and other combustible tobacco product initiation associated with e-cigarette use, we used an exposure frequency-matched cohort study design in which we contacted never-smoking e-cigarette users and a sample of never-smoking never e-cigarette users to complete a follow-up questionnaire (Fig 1). We attempted to contact all never-smoking e-cigarette users (n = 213) and a randomly selected frequency matched sample of never-smoking, never e-cigarette users (n = 213) from among all never-smoking never e-cigarette users in the cohort at initial evaluation; never-users were frequency matched to e-cigarette users by gender, ethnicity, and grade (11 or 12). Participants completed an online follow-up questionnaire between February 2015 and March 2016. Follow-up questionnaires were completed by 149 (70.0%) e-cigarette users and 154 (72.3%) never e-cigarette users; 146 e-cigarette users and 152 never users provided complete data on their use of cigarettes between initial evaluation and follow-up and were included in analyses. All participants were 18 years of age or older at follow-up. Participants turning 18 were sent a link to the follow-up online survey by e-mail (using e-mail address provided at the 11th- and 12th-grade data collection); additional attempts to contact participants were made by text message and telephone calls. Those not responding or who had not provided other contact information were sent letters soliciting participation to the last known residential address or were contacted through parents or other contacts previously provided by participants. FIGURE 1 Selection of participants for assessment of the association between e-cigarette use and subsequent initiation of combustible cigarettes. Ethics Statement The study was approved by the University of Southern California Institutional Review Board. Participants aged 18 or older provided written informed consent. Written parental informed consent and student assent were obtained for all CHS participants before data collection in 2014. Measures Tobacco and Alternative Tobacco Product Use At each survey, participants were asked whether they had ever tried e-cigarettes, cigarettes, cigars, pipes, or hookah and the number of days each product was used in the past 30 days.6 Participants who had \u201cnever tried\u201d a product (not \u201ceven 1 or 2 puffs\u201d) were classified as \u201cnever users.\u201d Those reporting an age at first use of each tobacco product were classified as \u201cever users\u201d of that product. All analyses were restricted to never cigarette smokers at initial evaluation. Sociodemographic Characteristics Self-administered questionnaires completed by parents of participants18 were used to assess gender, ethnicity (Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, other), and parental education (highest level of education of either parent; <12th grade, high school diploma or general equivalency diploma, some college, college degree, some graduate school or higher). Susceptibility to Cigarette Use Susceptibility to tobacco product use has been defined as the absence of a firm commitment not to smoke.10,11,13 In the current study, susceptibility to future cigarette use was assessed using validated measures (see Supplemental Material). Adolescents were classified as having no susceptibility if they responded \u201cdefinitely not\u201d to questions about intention to initiate use of cigarettes in the future.10 Social Environment The cigarette social environment was evaluated based on the following questions: (1) \u201cHow many of your 4 closest friends use [cigarettes]?\u201d (0\u20134 friends); (2) \u201cHow would your best friends act toward you if you used [cigarettes]?\u201d (very unfriendly, unfriendly, friendly, or very friendly); and (3) \u201cDoes anyone who lives with you now use [cigarettes]?\u201d (yes/no). These factors have been strongly associated with cigarette use17 and more recently have been associated with e-cigarette use in the CHS.6 Statistical Analysis On the basis of prospectively collected data, we used unconditional logistic regression models to evaluate the association between e-cigarette use at initial evaluation and subsequent cigarette use at follow-up. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to estimate the odds of smoking initiation. All models were adjusted for gender, ethnicity, grade and highest parental education, factors that have been associated both with e-cigarette use and cigarette use in previous studies.17,19 Potential confounding by history of combustible tobacco use other than cigarettes at initial evaluation, social environment characteristics, age at initial evaluation, age at follow-up, and time from initial evaluation to follow-up (in months) was evaluated on the basis of a change in effect estimate of >10% with inclusion of any of these variables. A missing indicator category was included where appropriate. Formal tests of interaction were used to evaluate whether effect estimates differed by gender, ethnicity (Hispanic white, non-Hispanic white, other), grade (11 or 12), ever use of hookah (a combustible product that has been previously associated with e-cigarette use,20 yes versus no), or susceptibility to smoking at initial evaluation (yes vs no). Additional analyses evaluated the risk of initiation of any combustible tobacco product (cigarettes, cigars, hookah, or pipes) associated with e-cigarette use at initial evaluation. Polytomous regression models were used to evaluate the risk of initiation of cigarette use (but no use in the past 30 days) and the risk of past 30-day cigarette use, relative to participants not initiating use of cigarettes. In sensitivity analyses, models evaluating the risk of initiation of cigarettes were restricted to nonusers of any combustible tobacco product at initial evaluation (cigarettes, cigars, hookah, pipes). All statistical analyses were based on 2-sided hypotheses tested at a .05 level of significance. Analyses were performed using SAS 9.4. Role of the Funding Source The funder had no role in the design and conduct of the study; collection, management, analysis, or interpretation of the data; or preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript. \n \n Results E-cigarette users and never users were similar on matching factors (gender, ethnicity, grade) and parental education. In adjusted models males were more likely to initiate cigarette use (OR = 1.84; 95% CI: 1.04\u20133.26; Table 1). Adolescents who were classified as susceptible to cigarette use were more likely to report e-cigarette use at initial evaluation (OR = 2.48; 95% CI: 1.44\u20134.27) and to report cigarette use at follow-up (OR = 3.03; 95% CI: 1.71\u20135.39). Having one or more friends who smoked combustible tobacco products also increased the likelihood of e-cigarette use at initial evaluation (OR = 2.61; 95% CI: 1.35\u20135.06) and cigarette use at follow-up (OR = 2.58; 95% CI: 1.30\u20135.09); having friends who were friendly to cigarette use was associated with e-cigarette use at initial evaluation (OR = 2.13; 95% CI: 1.24\u20133.65) but not with cigarette use at follow-up. The median age of participants at initial evaluation was 17.4 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 16.8\u201317.9); median age at follow-up was 18.6 years (IQR: 18.3\u201319.0 years); median time from initial evaluation to follow-up was 15.6 months (IQR: 12.6\u201318.2 months). TABLE 1 Demographic Characteristics of Participants by E-Cigarette Use at Initial Assessment and by Cigarette Use at Follow-up, N = 298 To assess the potential for selection bias, we compared sociodemographic characteristics of study participants for whom follow-up data were obtained with those lost to follow-up. Participants from whom follow-up data were collected were more likely to have a parent with at least a college education (Supplemental Table 5). No notable differences in gender, ethnicity, grade, or susceptibility to cigarette use were observed between retained participants and those lost to follow up. Among never e-cigarette users at initial evaluation, 16 (10.5%) reported use of cigarettes at follow-up; among ever e-cigarette users at the initial evaluation, 59 (40.4%) reported use of cigarettes at follow-up (Table 2). The adjusted OR for the association of e-cigarette use with subsequent smoking of combustible cigarettes was 6.17 (95% CI: 3.30\u201311.6). After further adjustment for cigar, pipe, or hookah use at initial evaluation, the association of e-cigarette use with subsequent smoking was slightly attenuated but still statistically significant (OR = 5.48; 95% CI: 2.69\u201311.2). Results did not differ appreciably after additional adjustment for social environment characteristics at initial evaluation (whether others in the home smoked, number of friends who smoked, friends\u2019 attitudes toward smoking), age at initial evaluation, age at follow-up, or time in months from initial evaluation to follow-up (results not shown). E-cigarette users had 5.49 times (95% CI: 2.68\u201311.2) the odds of initiating cigarette smoking but not having smoked in the past 30 days, and 7.50 times (95% CI: 2.41\u201323.4) the odds of reporting use of cigarettes in the past 30 days at follow-up compared with never e-cigarette users. Estimates were based on 39 (27.1%) initiators and 18 (12.5%) past 30-day cigarette users among e-cigarette users at baseline, compared with 12 (7.9%) initiators and 4 (2.6%) past 30-day cigarette users among never e-cigarette users at baseline; 2 participants reported initiation of smoking but did not report the number of days smoked in the past 30 days (results not tabulated). TABLE 2 Association Between E-Cigarette Use at Initial Assessment in 2014 and Subsequent Cigarette Use at Follow-up in 2015 Among adolescents who were not classified as susceptible to cigarette use at initial evaluation, 36.2% (n = 34) of e-cigarette users and 5.7% (n = 7) of never e-cigarette users reported initiation of cigarettes at follow up (OR not susceptible = 9.69; 95% CI: 4.02\u201323.4; Table 3). In contrast, among those who were classified as susceptible to smoking at initial evaluation, e-cigarette users were only slightly more likely to initiate cigarette use at follow-up (47.1% v. 32.1%; OR susceptible = 2.12; 95% CI: 0.79, 5.74; interaction P = .03). We also examined interactions of e-cigarette use at initial evaluation with gender, ethnicity, grade level, time from initial contact to completion of follow-up questionnaire, and use of hookah at initial evaluation. The risk of initiation of cigarette use associated with e-cigarettes did not differ by these characteristics. TABLE 3 Association Between E-Cigarette Use at Initial Assessment in 2014 and Subsequent Cigarette Use at Follow-up in 2015 by Indication of Susceptibility to Smoking at Initial Evaluation In an analysis restricted to those who reported no use of any combustible tobacco product at initial evaluation, e-cigarette users were also more likely to initiate use of any combustible tobacco product at follow-up (OR = 4.98; 95% CI: 2.37\u201310.4; Table 4) and to initiate use of cigarettes (OR = 4.29; 95% CI: 1.84\u201310.0), hookah (OR = 2.86; 95% CI: 1.21\u20136.78), cigars (OR = 4.39; 95% CI: 1.72\u201311.2), and pipes (OR = 8.21; 95% CI: 1.20\u201356.2). TABLE 4 Association Between E-Cigarette Use at Initial Assessment in 2014 and Subsequent Cigarette Use at Follow-up in 2015, Restricted to Never Users of Any Combustible Tobacco Product \n \n Discussion We prospectively evaluated the risk of smoking initiation associated with e-cigarette use in the transition to adulthood when it becomes legal to purchase cigarettes. In this sample of never cigarette users at initial evaluation, >40% of e-cigarette users initiated cigarette use during the 16-month (average) follow-up. Those who reported e-cigarette use had >6 times the odds of initiating cigarette use as never e-cigarette users. The associations remained statistically significant after adjustment for use of other combustible tobacco products at study entry and for social environmental factors. The increased risk of smoking initiation associated with previous e-cigarette use was also observed in sensitivity analyses restricted to never-users of any combustible tobacco product at initial evaluation; moreover, risk of subsequent initiation of any combustible tobacco product was also increased. Notably, the association of e-cigarettes with initiation of cigarette use was much stronger among those classified as not susceptible to becoming smokers. These findings suggest that e-cigarette use may promote smoking during the transition to adulthood, even in those considered to be at lower risk because of personal or environmental factors. Three studies on the longitudinal association between e-cigarette use and subsequent cigarette use among adolescents have been published.14\u201316 In the first, among ninth-grade students (mean age 14.1 years) with no history of combustible tobacco product use at initial evaluation, those who reported ever use of e-cigarettes had 1.75 (95% CI: 1.10\u20132.77) times the odds as never users of reporting subsequent use of cigarettes 12 months later, and 2.73 (95% CI: 2.00\u20133.73) times the odds of reporting use of any combustible tobacco product after adjustment for ever use of nonnicotine or tobacco substances, smoking expectancies (whether adolescents think they will enjoy smoking, or feel bad from smoking), and other potentially confounding characteristics at study entry.14 The second study was also among younger youth in grades 9 and 10 at baseline (mean age 14.7 years) and found similar results: e-cigarette users had 2.87 (95% CI: 2.03\u20134.05) times the odds of initiating combustible cigarette use between baseline and follow-up 1 year later as never users, after adjustment for age, gender, ethnicity, parental education, parental support, and rebelliousness.15 The third study found similar prospective associations in adolescents and young adults 16 to 26 years of age who reported being nonsusceptible to smoking at baseline, but the estimates were based on only 16 never-smoking e-cigarette users at initial evaluation.16 The current results extend the literature by showing that these associations generalize to the period at the end of high school. Our findings, together with those from the other prospective studies of youth and young adult populations, suggest that e-cigarette use is a clear and consistent indicator of likelihood of subsequent initiation of cigarette and other combustible tobacco product use at ages spanning from early adolescence through emerging adulthood. It is possible in principle that e-cigarette use among never smoking adolescents is a marker for those who would have begun to smoke even if e-cigarettes were not available. In these adolescents, the availability of e-cigarettes use may have delayed the initiation of smoking among those who would have gone on to smoke anyway. However, the risk of smoking associated with e-cigarette use was even higher among participants who reported no intention to smoke at initial assessment than among the group of adolescents who indicated they were likely to begin smoking. Among nonsusceptible individuals, 36% of e-cigarette users initiated cigarette use, compared with only 6% of nonusers (Table 3). Another recent study found that e-cigarette users had different psychological profiles than cigarette users.21,22 Together, these findings suggest that e-cigarettes are not merely a marker for individuals who would have gone on to smoke combustible cigarettes, regardless of the availability of e-cigarettes, but that e-cigarette use is likely introducing new youth to tobacco products and is increasing the likelihood of future smoking among the low-risk group who expressed confidence that they would not do so. It is also possible that e-cigarette users who initiated smoking were more likely to be experimenting with cigarettes and less likely than other initiators to progress to regular cigarette use and nicotine dependence. The duration of follow-up and small sample size (particularly among never e-cigarette users who began smoking) was insufficient to fully address this question. However, the prospective association of e-cigarette use with cigarette use in the past 30 days was similar to that for initiation but no use in the past 30 days. These results provide no evidence that e-cigarette users who initiate smoking are any less likely to progress to regular use of cigarettes than youth who did not begin tobacco use with e-cigarettes. There are some uncertainties to the conclusions from this study. Participants who were lost to follow-up were less likely to have a parent with at least a college education. However, in analyses examining whether the risk of initiation of smoking associated with e-cigarette use differed by education, no interaction was observed, nor were the estimates of effect of e-cigarette use on cigarette initiation confounded by education; thus, differential loss to follow-up in the cohort seems unlikely to be an explanation for the observed results. We did not collect information on type of e-cigarette used or nicotine content of e-cigarette at initial evaluation, factors that may increase the likelihood of transition from e-cigarette to cigarette or other combustible tobacco use. Although the study addresses a potentially vulnerable age range, results may not be generalizable to older populations or to other geographic regions. Finally, because the rate of initiation of cigarette use in never e-cigarette users was low in our Southern California population (10.5% based on 16 new users), the odds ratio associated with e-cigarette use was not precisely estimated. However, the associations were large and highly statistically significant. There are several plausible mechanisms through which e-cigarette use in adolescence may lead to subsequent initiation of cigarettes or other combustible tobacco products.17,23,24 E-cigarettes may lead to initiation of use of other combustible products because flavorings desensitize users\u2019 lungs to the harsh and aversive effects of nicotine inhalation, providing a more gradual transition from never smoking to use of combustible cigarettes or other combustible products. Flavorings, in combination with devices appealing to youth in this technological age (eg, \u201ctechie\u201d e-devices with programmable settings) may act to promote smoking initiation among adolescents and may also play a role in product use maintenance or progression to greater levels of use. Regular use of nicotine, and the development of nicotine dependence, may also lead adolescents to seek other forms of nicotine. Adolescents first introduced to nicotine via e-cigarettes may develop a dependence on nicotine and may then move on to other forms of nicotine, including cigarettes or other combustible products. Individuals genetically susceptible to the addictive properties of nicotine may be at particularly high risk. Finally, rapid increases in e-cigarette use in adolescent populations have already begun to contribute to the normalization of e-cigarette use, which indirectly functions to normalize \u201csmoking-like\u201d behaviors more generally (eg, clouds of smoke/vapor in public places become normative). The normalization of these social behaviors may facilitate initiation of cigarette smoking if society becomes more accepting of alternative tobacco product use. Future work exploring these and other mechanisms through which e-cigarette use in adolescence may influence willingness to initiate cigarette smoking is warranted. Regardless of the mechanisms underlying the associations of e-cigarettes with cigarette use, this research adds much needed data to the emerging evidence that e-cigarettes are associated with increased risk of smoking among adolescents. Because e-cigarette use is common in adolescents and young adults, further prospective follow-up of this and other cohorts is needed to determine whether e-cigarette use will increase population rates of cigarette and other combustible tobacco products and their associated burden of disease. \n \n Footnotes Accepted April 7, 2016. \n \n April 7, 2016.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 With the debut of vaping in the US in 2007, there was hope that teens who smoked would replace old-school cigarettes with e-cigarettes, curbing tobacco use. But a new USC study in the journal Pediatrics has found teens who never would have smoked regular cigarettes are experimenting with vaping. Another USC study finds older teens who try vaping are six times more likely to try a tobacco-filled cigarette than non-vapers, per a press release. \"E-cigarettes may be recruiting a new group of kids to tobacco use,\" says Jessica Barrington-Trimis, lead author of both studies. While e-cigs may seem safer than tobacco, if they come pumped with nicotine (some don't), kids can get addicted. The New York Times notes chemicals in the vaping liquid may be harmful; WebMD adds long-term effects are unknown. Using participants from USC's Children's Health Study, scientists followed 5,490 teens who graduated high school in select years between 1995 and 2015, asking them via questionnaire about their tobacco use. It's true that rates among Southern California teens who said they had smoked over the past 30 days fell significantly from 1995 to 2004 (19% to 9%), and slightly more in the decade after that (a bit less than 8% by 2014). But when teens were asked to include e-cigarettes in their assessments, the smoking rate jumped back up to 14% in 2014. And that's got scientists worried, especially with the prevalence of e-cigarettes that come in kid-friendly flavors such as cotton candy. \"E-cigarettes may be safer than regular cigarettes for adults who are transitioning from smoking to vaping, but for youth who have never used any other tobacco products, nicotine experimentation could become nicotine addiction,\" Barrington-Trimis says.",
    "generated_summary": "E-cigarettes do not burn tobacco, but are battery-operated inhalers that heat up and vaporize liquid containing flavors and nicotine. The liquids used in vaping range in taste from traditional tobacco and menthol flavors to fruity and sweet combinations like gummi bear, banana bread and cotton candy. About 14 percent of Southern California high school seniors in 2014 said they had smoked or vaped in the last 30 days. Researchers say they have not seen similar levels of nicotine use among teenagers since 1995, when 12th-grade smoking rates were 19 percent. While e-cigarettes appear to be safer than smoking tobacco, they are not risk free.",

It\u2019s in this picturesque suburban hamlet just 47 miles north of the chaos of midtown Manhattan that Tambor and his wife, Kasia, 49, raise their four children who range in age from 8 to 13. And since being fired three months ago from Transparent, it\u2019s here where Tambor has been exiled in what will surely go down as the darkest chapter of his four-decade career. \n \n Moments later, he is in a coffee shop on the town\u2019s main street. \u201cI love diners,\u201d says Tambor, freshly shaven and neatly dressed in a pinstriped shirt and a zippered navy pullover. \u201cI used to live on 100th and Second Avenue, on the Upper East Side. And I practically lived at a diner.\u201d \n \n The conversation continues like this for a few minutes, a stiff exchange of pleasantries, during which Tambor twists a plastic straw, shredding its paper sleeve. He pauses. \u201cI have to tell you something,\u201d he says, his fingers trembling. It\u2019s obvious before he says it: He\u2019s nervous. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve talked about this, ever,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd possibly the last time. I used to teach acting, you know, and I\u2019d always say, \u2018Announce where you are.\u2019 So this is me doing that.\u201d \n \n Where Tambor is right now is uncharted territory. He is about to become the first high-profile subject of the sweeping #MeToo movement to sit for an in-depth interview about his alleged sexual harassment scandal. His is a dizzying tale entangled in Rashomon-like perspectives and political trip wires. And at the center of it all stand three figures: Tambor and his two accusers, Van Barnes, Tambor\u2019s former assistant, and Trace Lysette, an actress on the series. \n \n That Barnes and Lysette are both transgender women is not insignificant. After all, Transparent \u2014 led by Tambor\u2019s twice Emmy-winning performance as Maura Pfefferman \u2014 was only recently being held up as a beacon of social progressivism, lauded by activist groups like GLAAD for igniting a global transgender movement. In the blink of an eye, however, all that has changed, as Tambor \u2014 who admits to having lifelong anger issues but denies sexually harassing his accusers \u2014 watched his image go from that of LGBTQ folk hero to fugitive. \n \n Tambor learned that he\u2019d been fired in a text message from Jill Soloway on Feb. 15. That was the day Amazon \u2014 still reeling from the exit four months earlier of its top content executive, Roy Price, over sexual harassment claims \u2014 announced it would not be renewing Tambor\u2019s option after an internal investigation. Soloway, the show\u2019s 52-year-old creator and showrunner \u2014 whose father\u2019s transition inspired the story \u2014 followed up that text with a phone call a few minutes later. Tambor was at his local gym at the time, sweating on a recumbent stationary bicycle. \u201cI don\u2019t remember the whole conversation,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I do remember her last words were: \u2018Do you need help with a statement?\u2019\u201d He went into shock: \u201cIf you can picture a man outside a gym for forever, in his workout shorts and everything, just staring.\u201d Tambor had been preparing himself for \u201ca slap on the wrist\u201d for what he says were his temperamental outbursts on the set. Never did he think his biggest career triumph would end in such unceremonious disgrace. \n \n The path to the firing began four months earlier, when, inspired by the #MeToo declarations she was seeing on social media, Barnes \u2014 a gregarious, 43-year-old blonde who relocated from rural Missouri to Los Angeles for the opportunity of working for Tambor \u2014 typed her own #MeToo account on her personal Facebook page. \u201cOh hell yeah! ME TOO!\u201d Barnes wrote on Oct. 16, 2017. \u201c[I was] even told [by Tambor] that \u2018for that kind\u2019a money and after all that time of working for him that I should be sleeping with him if I want a Hollywood-industry-appropriate pay grade.\u2019\u201d \n \n The post, which never mentions Tambor by name, referred to an employer who gave her \u201cbutt pats,\u201d made \u201c\u2018why aren\u2019t I taking care of him sexually\u2019 comments\u201d and subjected her to \u201clistening to his porno.\u201d Wrote Barnes: \u201cI was depressed and thought about suicide when I left that job.\u201d The post rapidly circulated among the transgender community and beyond. On Nov. 8, 2017, Amazon Studios confirmed that an investigation into Barnes\u2019 claims was in its \u201cearly stages.\u201d Tambor released a statement that day dismissing Barnes as a \u201cformer disgruntled assistant ... I am appalled and distressed at this baseless allegation.\u201d \n \n One person who read Barnes\u2019 post with interest was Lysette. A striking brunette with fair skin and aquamarine eyes, Lysette, who prefers not to disclose her age, grew up in Dayton, Ohio \u2014 she choreographed a dance routine for her high school cheerleading squad \u2014 then moved to New York City, where she began transitioning to female. She later found work at a Manhattan strip club, where she never let on to the clientele that she was transgender. After a bad breakup led to a suicide attempt \u2014 she slit her wrists on a side street walking home from the strip club one night \u2014 Lysette was admitted to Bellevue Hospital\u2019s psychiatric ward. After her release, inspired by the success of the transgender actress Laverne Cox on Orange Is the New Black, she continued to pursue her acting dreams. By 2013, she was flying to Los Angeles to audition for the role of Davina on Transparent, a trans woman who takes Maura under her wing. \u201cWe met with many, many trans actresses and writers in our outreach,\u201d says Soloway of that early hiring sweep. (Since creating Transparent, Soloway has started self-identifying as \u201cgender non-binary\u201d; the pronoun \u201cthey\u201d is preferred instead of \u201cshe.\u201d) The part ended up going to another actress, Alexandra Billings, but Lysette impressed Soloway enough to have her own character written into the show \u2014 a yoga teacher and stripper named Shea. \n \n According to Lysette, then a Hollywood neophyte, the unsolicited advances from Tambor started early on. \u201cThey began as flirtation \u2014 kisses on the forehead, which was awkward,\u201d she tells THR. \u201cBut part of me was like, \u2018OK, maybe he just thinks of me as a daughter figure or something.\u2019\" Lysette says the unwanted affection spilled onto red carpets. \u201cI would kiss him on the cheek and it would land on my lips,\u201d she recalls. \n \n It wasn\u2019t until the filming of the third episode of season two, \u201cNew World Coming,\u201d that Lysette felt Tambor had crossed a clear line. While shooting a breakfast scene in skimpy pajamas, Lysette says she was told by Tambor, \u201cMy God, Trace, I want to attack you sexually.\u201d (Billings, who was also in the scene, confirms her account to THR). Recalls Lysette, \u201cWe were like, \u2018What? Who says that?\u2019\u201d A few minutes later, she says, Tambor \u201cwaddled over to me in his pajamas and put his feet on top of mine, and started these little, like, thrusts on my hip. They were discreet and insidious and creepy. I felt his genitals on me. And I pushed him off.\u201d \n \n On Nov. 16, Lysette detailed that incident in a statement to THR. \u201cGiven the circumstances of my life,\u201d she wrote, \u201cI was used to being treated as a sexual object by men \u2014 this one just happened to be famous.\u201d She went on to express her hope that Amazon would \u201cfind good in this, and use this as an opportunity to re-center the other trans characters in this show. Don\u2019t let the trans community suffer for the actions of one cis male actor. Remove the problem and let the show go on.\u201d \n \n That Tambor is cisgender, or identifies as his birth sex, was a sticking point for many in the trans community from the start. At a season one screening at the Directors Guild of America, an audience member said Tambor\u2019s performance was \u201clike watching blackface\u201d and that he should be replaced by a trans actress. The suggestion mortified Tambor, literally. \u201cI just made like a possum and played dead,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI remember turning to my right and Jill was in tears.\u201d As the show grew in popularity and acclaim, so did the \u201celephant in the room,\u201d as Tambor puts it. \u201cBecause the revolution got bigger. So the very thing we were doing, the awakening to this movement, made the disparity [of my non-transness] more apparent.\u201d \n \n After Lysette\u2019s claims went public, Tambor convened an emergency meeting with his wife, Poland-born actress Kasia Ostlun, and his reps, including Gersh\u2019s Leslie Siebert, his agent of 30 years. \u201cMy advice to him was be truthful,\u201d Siebert recalls. \u201cTell people your understanding and your truth. That\u2019s all you can do.\u201d \n \n They crafted a second statement, this one taking on a measure of culpability. \u201cI find myself accused of behavior that any civilized person would condemn unreservedly,\u201d it read. \u201cI know I haven\u2019t always been the easiest person to work with. I can be volatile and ill-tempered, and too often I express my opinions harshly and without tact. But I have never been a predator \u2014 ever.\u201d \n \n The following day, Tambor received an email from Faith Soloway, 54, Jill\u2019s older sister and a writing producer on Transparent. \u201cI can quote it verbatim because I\u2019ve looked at it for five months,\u201d Tambor insists. He would not show the email to THR, but a source confirms its content. \u201cIt said, \u2018We are in a coup. You are fucking fantastic. You have changed the world. We have changed the world. We will get through this. Love, love, love, Faith.'\u201d \n \n Faith Soloway confirms having sent the email. \"Things were happening so quickly, with people being accused and held accountable by the #MeToo movement,\" she says. \"In the moment I felt that Jill and Jeffrey were under attack. I knew that some people disapproved of Jeffrey, a cisgender actor, playing Maura and I was upset that Jill, as the show's creator, hadn't had the opportunity to address the issue privately [before it went public]. As the story broke, I also sent messages of support to Trace and Van, and after the allegations were presented, I never disbelieved them. I still, hope everyone can learn and heal from this.\u201d \n \n The message sent a \u201cshock wave\u201d through him because it led him to believe that \u201csomething was up, over and above me. Some dots were not connecting.\u201d Suspecting he was being set up to be ousted because he is cisgender, Tambor released a third, more pointed statement on Nov. 19. \u201cWhat has become clear over the past weeks,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis that this is no longer the job I signed up for four years ago ... Given the politicized atmosphere that seems to have afflicted our set, I don\u2019t see how I can return to Transparent.\u201d \n \n Despite having been widely interpreted as such, the statement was never meant to be a definitive resignation letter, Tambor maintains, adding he \u201cchose those words exactly to be a little abstract.\u201d That evening, he says, he received an email from Jill Soloway (which Soloway confirms she sent). \u201cShe wrote these words: \u2018They have been after Maura from the beginning.\u2019\u201d \n \n Soloway responds: \u201cWhile much of the trans community immediately embraced the show, some vocally opposed the casting of a cis man, Jeffrey, in the lead role. This sentiment has persisted in parts of the community \u2014 coming up again on social media in the wake of these allegations. It was a text I wrote in frustration after pouring my heart into this show for years. I wanted to tell a story that brought power and visibility to trans people, and to my own family\u2019s journey into understanding, acceptance, and pride.\u201d \n \n Over the phone, they discussed how to proceed, which for Tambor would be \u201cone of the top-five difficult phone calls of my life.\u201d \n \n In it, Soloway \u2014 frantic and highly emotional over the beloved series\u2019 implosion \u2014 asked Tambor if he would be \u201copen to a third way.\u201d Soloway suggested that, going forward, Tambor appear in the series only in flashback, as Mort Pfefferman, Maura\u2019s pre-transition self. It was a not ideal but potentially workable concession to those who felt Tambor\u2019s performance was an offensive example of \u201ctransface,\u201d as some critics referred to it. Of course, the plan did nothing to address the Pandora\u2019s box of sexual misconduct allegations that had just spilled into headlines. For the sake of the show, Tambor tentatively agreed to play the pre-trans character, just as soon as he was cleared by Amazon of the more ominous charges. \n \n But that would not happen. Tambor was interviewed for nearly 10 hours during the inquiry, in two marathon sessions. \u201cMy lawyer was present,\u201d he says, obviously reluctant to get into the details. \u201cThey asked me questions, and I responded to the questions. And that\u2019s pretty much what I want to say about that.\u201d Others were interviewed, as well. Staffers were asked whether Tambor had ever kissed them on the lips \u2014 which was something he often felt comfortable enough to do in their cozy work environment. \u201cIt\u2019s a really loose set,\u201d says one high-ranking producer who asked not to be identified. \u201cEverybody behaves in a sensual manner because it\u2019s a show about sex. Everyone says things like, \u2018You\u2019re so hot, oh my God. I had a dream about you last night.\u2019\u201d As Jay Duplass, who plays Maura\u2019s music producer son, Josh, on the show, once put it, \u201cYour job as an actor is to be emotionally present ... Or in the case of Transparent, have a ton of sex.\u201d \n \n Lysette never wavered on her story, telling investigators that she reported the thrusting incident promptly and that no action was taken. \"I told plenty of people,\" she says. \"I told people outside of Transparent, I told people inside Transparent.\u201d One of those people was her roommate, Zackary Drucker, a 35-year-old producer on the show, who is also a trans woman. Drucker did not pass on the information. \n \n \u201cTrace and I shared many, many conversations during our time as roommates,\u201d says Drucker. \u201cSince I don\u2019t have a clear memory of this conversation, it didn\u2019t register to me as something I was meant to, or needed to, report in the context of our professional relationship.\u201d \n \n Barnes, meanwhile, had been laying low from the press; she\u2019d signed a nondisclosure agreement with Tambor as part of her employment. But, on Feb. 26, a few weeks after Tambor was fired, Barnes\u2019 lawyer told her the NDA was no longer in effect, and she gave an interview to THR. \u201cI was barely at minimum wage, which was a clear abuse,\u201d Barnes said, claiming she had to endure Tambor\u2019s severe mood swings and round-the-clock demands. Despite Barnes\u2019 reputation for having a raunchy sense of humor \u2014 \u201cShe\u2019s the dirtiest fucking talker in the world,\u201d is how one staffer puts it \u2014 Tambor\u2019s alleged offensive talk and occasional \u201cbutt pats\u201d made Barnes increasingly uncomfortable. \u201cToward the end, he had proposed to me that I be his mistress,\u201d she said. \u201cHis actions have jeopardized many people\u2019s jobs, especially many transgender people struggling to find work in Hollywood. ... He has done this to himself.\u201d \n \n Barnes continued speaking out on March 7, when she appeared on Megyn Kelly Today to add a startling new detail to her accusation: that Tambor had once watched her sleeping naked. She said it happened, bizarrely, when Barnes, Lysette and Tambor were living together under the same roof in Drucker\u2019s parents\u2019 home in Highland Park, northeast of downtown L.A., where Barnes was house-sitting over the summer. Lysette, still based in New York at the time, was occupying one of the bedrooms. Before production on the second season began, there was a two-week window until Tambor\u2019s Pacific Palisades rental home would be ready. \u201cHe said, \u2018You\u2019re house-sitting, aren\u2019t you? Do you mind if I stay with you?\u2019\u201d Barnes recalls. \u201cI thought it was really weird. Here\u2019s a guy of means, but he can\u2019t afford a hotel for two weeks?\u201d \n \n Tambor confirms sharing living quarters with Barnes and Lysette \u2014 \u201cMy arrangements hadn\u2019t come together. In retrospect, I should not have stayed there and just waited for my house to become ready\u201d \u2014 but insists Barnes\u2019 claims that he observed her sleeping naked are completely fabricated. Asked to address other specific allegations, including the propositioning and physical touching, he grows reticent. \u201cI don\u2019t want to characterize them,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I said was that she was a disgruntled assistant. I think that was generous of me. I dispute her account. I did raise my voice at times, I was moody at times, there were times when I was tactless. But as for the other stuff, absolutely not.\u201d \n \n Siebert admits to having been aware of her client\u2019s mercurial reputation. \u201cHe\u2019s guilty of being an asshole at times, and being, you know, temperamental and moody,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd he feels awful about it and apologizes, and he\u2019s working on himself. But in the 30 years I\u2019ve worked with him, I\u2019ve never been told about any behavior like what these women are accusing him of.\u201d Tambor acknowledges the occasional outburst on previous shows \u2014 he references one \u201cblowup\u201d with actress Jessica Walter on Arrested Development for which he later \u201cprofusely apologized\u201d (a rep for Walter says, \u201cJessica does not wish to talk about Jeffrey Tambor\u201d) \u2014 but that something about Maura, his obsessive determination to make her as authentic as possible, brought out the worst in him. \n \n \u201cI drove myself and my castmates crazy,\u201d he says. \u201cLines got blurred. I was difficult. I was mean. I yelled at Jill \u2014 she told me recently she was afraid of me. I yelled at the wonderful [executive producer] Bridget Bedard in front of everybody. I made her cry. And I apologized and everything, but still, I yelled at her. The assistant directors. I was rude to my assistant. I was moody. Sometimes I didn\u2019t talk at all. And this is where the reader says, \u2018So what?\u2019 You know? \u2018You\u2019re coming in from the Palisades, you drive in, you get a good paycheck, you get to play one of the best roles in the world. So. What.\u2019\u201d He stares down at his barely touched lunch, a grilled ham and cheese sandwich propping up a pile of french fries. \u201cBut I was scared, because I was a cisgender male playing Maura Pfefferman. And my whole thing was, \u2018Am I doing it right? Am I doing it right? Am I doing it right?\u2019 To the point that I worried myself to death.\u201d \n \n Soloway and Tambor have not spoken since Feb. 15. That\u2019s the day Soloway issued a statement expressing \u201cgreat respect and admiration for Van Barnes and Trace Lysette, whose courage in speaking out about their experience on Transparent is an example of the leadership this moment in our culture requires.\u201d Tambor issued his own rebuttal, saying he was \u201cprofoundly disappointed\u201d in the \u201cdeeply flawed and biased\u201d investigation\u2019s outcome and \u201ceven more disappointed in Jill Soloway\u2019s unfair characterization of me as someone who would ever cause harm to my fellow castmates.\u201d \n \n Tambor is still wounded by what he characterizes as his abandonment by Soloway. \u201cI said to her, \u2018Since you know the truth, would you make a public statement on my behalf?\u2019 It\u2019s my biggest disappointment that she hasn\u2019t.\u201d To that, Soloway responds: \u201cI never told him I was going to accuse Van or Trace of being liars. He knew that nobody could do that. And I was really working with him to help him understand that a simple apology would go a really long way. I was hoping to get him there.\u201d \n \n Soloway\u2019s own thinking on Tambor has evolved since the controversy broke. \u201cI was hoping, in those early days, before Trace\u2019s initial statement came out, that it all could have been a big misinterpretation \u2014 that one person\u2019s harassment is another person\u2019s dirty joke.\u201d Eventually, Soloway realized the #MeToo movement was a \u201cglobal tsunami \u2014 there\u2019s nothing I could have done to stop it.\u201d As for the allegations, Soloway contends that \u201cit\u2019s not a simple case of did he do it or didn\u2019t he do it. Nobody said he was a predator \u2014 they said he sexually harassed people. He made enemies, and I don\u2019t think he realized he was making enemies. You have to be very, very careful if you\u2019re a person in power and treat people very appropriately.\u201d \n \n As for the future of Transparent, Soloway has begun to feel \u201ca tiny bit like we are going to be OK.\u201d The writing staff has begun discussions on how to tackle the show\u2019s fifth \u2014 and, Soloway reveals, final \u2014 season. \u201cHopefully it sets the Pfeffermans up with some sort of beautiful reclaiming,\u201d Soloway says. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to get there with some time.\u201d \n \n Since going public, Lysette and Barnes have taken different paths: Lysette is still pursuing acting in L.A. and has become politically active, speaking at events like the Las Vegas Women\u2019s March and attending Time\u2019s Up meetings. Barnes has returned to Missouri and enrolled in cosmetology school. \u201cI have turned a new leaf!\u201d Barnes wrote in an April 26 Facebook post. \u201cThis did not come with any assistance from my previous employer Transparent, nor Amazon or the fake feminist Jill Soloway, who found reason to fire our perpetrator, & instead of offering me financial reparations to upright myself again, offered me a Go Fund Me.\u201d \n \n As for Tambor, he has only just begun to emerge from what he calls a \u201cfugue state.\u201d When speaking about Maura, he almost exclusively uses the terminology of death and grieving. He\u2019s currently reading two books on the subject, The Five Invitations: Discovering What Death Can Teach Us About Living Fully and The Bright Hour: A Memoir of Living and Dying. He breaks down in tears five separate times over the course of this interview, making note of it each time he does. \u201cShe was like a friend,\u201d he says of Maura. \u201cThat may trigger eye rolls, but she was very real to me. And I think in many ways much more awake than I.\u201d He says he still has regular conversations out loud with Maura and is deeply disappointed that she won\u2019t ever get \u201cto find her significant other.\u201d \n \n Despite his troubles, he still has a job on Arrested Development, the Netflix comedy in which Tambor plays the patriarch of another dysfunctional California clan, the Bluths. Its fifth season premieres on the streaming service May 29 in order to qualify it for the Emmy voting window. The scandal provided an unwelcome distraction during the final months of production, which began in August 2017 and wrapped in December. Nevertheless, Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos tells THR that it was a smooth shoot and Tambor will be in attendance at upcoming media appearances, including a May 17 premiere event in Hollywood. \u201cIn making and promoting seasons four and five of Arrested Development,\u201d Sarandos says, \u201cJeffrey has always been totally professional.\u201d So far, Tambor has earned support from fellow castmember David Cross (\u201cA number of us stand behind him, ... and I am one of them,\u201d Cross told amNew York in an interview) while another, Alia Shawkat, who also appeared on Transparent, told IndieWire she was \u201csurprised\u201d by the allegations but \u201csupports the voice of the victims.\u201d \n \n Later that afternoon, after mixing with the locals at a nearby bookstore cafe \u2014 he offers one young man, an aspiring actor, some advice about an upcoming audition \u2014 Tambor turns back to the matter at hand, pledging the lessons he needed to learn have been learned. \u201cPeople change,\u201d he insists. \u201cIt\u2019s already changed my behavior on set. Just walking in here today, into this cafe, I hadn\u2019t seen the owner in a long time. I mean, do you hug? Do you not hug? When you see fans ...\u201d He trails off. \u201cYou know what I do feel? More present. Everything\u2019s just clearer to me.\u201d \n \n Tambor spends as much time as he can with his children, whom he\u2019s attempted to shield from his ordeal. His favorite activity is reading bedtime stories to his 8-year-old twins Hugo and Eli. \u201cI know Goodnight Moon pretty well,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd there\u2019s this other book about a bear hunt. I\u2019ve read it to every generation of child. They go on a bear hunt and they say, \u2018Uh-oh, there\u2019s mud! You can\u2019t go over it, you can\u2019t go under it. Got to go through it.\u2019 And I can\u2019t think of anything more typical in my life right now.\u201d \n \n May 7, 3:45 p.m. Updated to clarify that Trace Lysette was not a member of her high school cheerleading squad, but did choreograph a dance with the team for a halftime show. \n \n This story also appears in the May 2 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

New episodes begin streaming on Netflix May 29. AP \n \n Jeffrey Tambor in New York Monday to promote the new season of \"Arrested Development.\" (Photo: Cindy Ord, Getty Images for SiriusXM) \n \n NEW YORK \u2013 Jeffrey Tambor is back in the spotlight, three months after he was fired from Amazon's Transparent following allegations of sexual harassment. \n \n The two-time Emmy winner is on a promotional tour for Season 5 of Netflix's Arrested Development (streaming May 29), which wrapped production last fall, just after his Transparent co-stars Van Barnes and Trace Lysette came forward with accusations of inappropriate and abusive behavior. Tambor has repeatedly denied the allegations, most recently in The Hollywood Reporter earlier this month. \n \n Sitting down with his Arrested co-stars Monday, the actor told USA TODAY that he was sad to leave the role of transgender matriarch Maura Pfefferman on Transparent, which will end with a fifth and final season (and without Tambor). \n \n \"I'll miss her terribly,\" Tambor says. \"I just send my love to that cast and that wonderful crew,\" but \"I couldn't be happier\" to be a part of Arrested again. \n \n Tambor will not return to the role of Maura Pfefferman for the fifth and final season of Amazon's \"Transparent.\" (Photo: Jennifer Clasen, Amazon) \n \n Tambor, who plays the shifty real-estate developer George Bluth Sr. on Arrested, has confirmed occasional outbursts on both sets, telling THR, \"I was difficult. I was mean.\" \n \n Asked whether there's anything he wishes he'd done differently, Tambor says, \"Absolutely. The death of Maura has been like a death. It\u2019s like a grief, but in grief you learn. And I\u2019ve learned that I need to be more patient. I need to be more of a gentleman in how I interact with my castmates and not lose my temper. It has been a real wake-up and I\u2019m, in a way, grateful for that. It\u2019s informing my life right now.\" \n \n RELATED: Jeffrey Tambor tells his side of the story on 'Transparent' firing \n \n MORE: Remix can't save 'Arrested Development' Season 4 from itself \n \n Tambor's Arrested co-stars have stood by him since allegations surfaced last November, with Jason Bateman calling him an \"absolute joy\" to work with. But Alia Shawkat, who plays George Sr.'s granddaughter Maeby F\u00fcnke, says she supports both the actor and alleged victims, which can be \"difficult.\" \n \n The Me Too movement \"is more powerful than anything I could say and I would never stand against it,\" Shawkat says. \"I know people who are victims of sexual harassment, and it\u2019s important that their voices are heard. ... Because we're entertainers, (the media) want us to choose these very black-and-white sides, and sexual harassment isn't black and white.

    "document": "The World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) has announced that its database was accessed by a Russian hacking group, which posted the confidential medical data of several US athletes online on Monday. \n \n The cyber espionage group, known as Fancy Bear, released records on four female American Olympic athletes: tennis stars Serena and Venus Williams, gymnastics multi-gold medallist Simone Biles and basketball player Elena Delle Donne. \n \n In each case, the hackers published records of so-called \u201cTherapeutic Use Exemptions\u201d, which permit athletes to use certain otherwise banned substances if they have a verified medical reason to do so.

In other words, they just got their licences for doping.\u201d \n \n US Anti-Doping Agency (Usada) chief Travis Tygart said in a statement that it was \u201cunthinkable\u201d for hackers to \u201cillegally obtain confidential medical information in an attempt to smear athletes to make it look as if they have done something wrong.\u201d He added: \u201cIn fact, in each of the situations, the athlete has done everything right in adhering to the global rules for obtaining permission to use a needed medication.\u201d \n \n Wada Report Outlines Alleged Russian Doping Cover Up System Used in Sochi \n \n Wada had previously warned that it might face cyberattacks, following its investigators\u2019 revelations of Russian state-sponsored doping in the run-up to the Rio Games this summer. \u201cThese criminal acts are greatly compromising the effort by the global anti-doping community to re-establish trust in Russia,\u201d said Olivier Niggli, the agency\u2019s director general. \u201cWada deeply regrets this situation and is very conscious of the threat that it represents to athletes whose confidential information has been divulged.\u201d \n \n The agency said it believed the hack was carried out using spear-phishing emails to gather passwords for the Wada Anti-Doping Administration and Management System (Adams) database. Less than a month ago, the agency confirmed that a hacker had accessed the Adams account for Yuliya Stepanova, the Russian 800-metre runner who blew the whistle on the widespread doping among her country\u2019s Olympic team. \n \n More than 100 Russian athletes were subsequently banned from competing in Rio, following the publication of an independently commissioned Wada report, which found evidence of a Russian state-run doping programme going back at least four years. ||||| Image copyright AP Image caption Simone Biles' confidential medical data has been released \n \n The World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) has condemned Russian hackers for leaking confidential medical files of star US Olympic athletes. \n \n Athletes affected include tennis players Venus and Serena Williams and teenage gymnast Simone Biles. \n \n A group calling itself \"Fancy Bears\" claimed responsibility for the hack of a Wada database. \n \n After the leak, Ms Biles said she had long been taking medicine for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. \n \n The hacker group had accused her of taking an \"illicit psycho-stimulant\", but she said she had \"always followed the rules\". \n \n The Rio Olympics quadruple gold medallist had obtained the necessary permission to take prescription medicine on the Wada banned drugs list, USA Gymnastics said in a statement. \n \n Image copyright @Simone_Biles \n \n Wada said in a statement that the cyber attacks were an attempt to undermine the global anti-doping system. \n \n Russian government spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was \"out of the question\" that the Kremlin or secret services were involved in the hacking, Russian news agencies reported. \n \n The hackers accessed records detailing \"Therapeutic Use Exemptions\" (TUEs), which allow the use of banned substances due to athletes' verified medical needs. \n \n \"By virtue of the TUE, Biles has not broken any drug-testing regulations, including at the Olympic Games in Rio,\" USA Gymnastics said. \n \n Fancy Bears said TUEs amount to \"licences for doping\". \n \n The leaked documents allege that Serena Williams was granted permission to use drugs commonly used to treat muscle injuries, such as anti-inflammatories, while Biles is said to use Ritalin - a treatment for her ADHD. \n \n Former - Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority head Richard Ings said: \"Nothing I see here gives me cause for alarm,\" adding it looked \"totally normal\". \n \n \"The issue here is privacy breach.\" \n \n 'Compromising trust' \n \n Russia's track and field team were banned from the Rio Olympics over an alleged state-backed doping programme. All of its athletes are barred from the ongoing Paralympics. \n \n \"Let it be known that these criminal acts are greatly compromising the effort by the global anti-doping community to re-establish trust in Russia,\" Wada director-general Olivier Niggli said. \n \n 'An act of revenge?' - Analysis by BBC sports editor Dan Roan \n \n This is the latest twist in what was already the biggest doping scandal in the history of sport, and further evidence of the bitter divisions it has sparked. \n \n The hack appears to be an act of revenge - retaliation for Wada's damning report into Russian state-sponsored cheating. \n \n Although the Russian government has denied any involvement, it has always maintained that the country has been made a scapegoat for a much wider problem, and this will only add fuel to that fire. \n \n Although the athletes concerned have broken no rules, the revelations - along with the threat of more leaks of other competitors' medical records - will inevitably exacerbate the controversy surrounding TUEs at a time when sport's leaders are desperately trying to restore trust. \n \n Many athletes will now be nervously wondering if their private medical details records are the next to be made public. \n \n And with the future of Wada currently in the balance, the fact its security was so badly compromised will raise more questions over the entire anti-doping system, especially after the account of Russian whistleblower Yuliya Stepanova was hacked last month, leading to fears for her safety. \n \n US Anti-Doping Agency chief Travis Tygart called the hack \"cowardly and despicable\". \n \n \"In each of the situations, the athlete has done everything right in adhering to the global rules for obtaining permission to use a needed medication,\" he said. \n \n Image copyright PA Image caption Serena Williams has won four Olympics golds in her career \n \n The US Olympic Committee has had \"zero adverse findings from the Rio Olympic Games that weren't 100% within the medical guidelines set forth by anti-doping authorities,\" spokesman Patrick Sandusky said. \n \n Earlier this month, Mr Niggli said Wada was experiencing almost daily cyber attacks originating from Russia. \n \n Fancy Bears, which is also known as Tsar Team (APT28), has pledged to release confidential records from other national Olympic teams. \n \n How Wada was hacked - Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter \n \n Image copyright Reuters \n \n It's an old adage in cybersecurity that the weakest point of any supposedly secure system is the people that use it. \n \n Wada says it believes this hack was made possible thanks to a successful spearphishing attack. Phishing is a term given to the technique of tricking a user into giving up crucial information - often by clicking a link that takes them to a malicious website disguised as a familiar one, such as the log-in page for a bank or social network. \n \n Spearphishing takes this one significant step further. While a phishing attack is often aimed at many people in the hope some will fall for it, spearphishing is highly targeted. Hackers perhaps identified a small number of people, or even just one person, and wrote a phishing attack specifically designed to trick them. \n \n Other than pushing a message of vigilance among staff, spearphishing is incredibly difficult to defend against. Attackers often scour the internet, looking for added information on the target that might make an email more believable. Sometimes even knowing a person's favourite football team is enough to tip the balance in making a spearphishing email seem genuine. ||||| Russian hackers \u2014 possibly the same group that compromised the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computer servers \u2014 have made top American athletes their latest target. \n \n Joining an intercontinental dispute over sports doping, the hackers penetrated the World Anti-Doping Agency\u2019s athlete database and publicly revealed private medical information about three of the United States\u2019 most famous athletes: Serena Williams, Venus Williams and Simone Biles. \n \n The hackers published documents this week showing that Ms. Biles, who won four gold medals in gymnastics at the Rio Olympics last month, and the Williams sisters received medical exemptions to use banned drugs. \n \n The antidoping agency confirmed the authenticity of the documents in a statement Tuesday, attributing the hack to Fancy Bear, a Russian cyberespionage group that forensics specialists have tied to breaches against government agencies, nonprofit organizations and corporations. That group is believed to be associated with G.R.U., the Russian military intelligence agency suspected of involvement in the recent theft of emails and documents from the D.N.C. ||||| The World Anti-Doping Agency said Tuesday that a Russian government hacking group had gained access to a database containing drug-test results and confidential medical data from last month\u2019s Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. On Monday, the group began posting confidential information about noteworthy U.S. Olympic athletes \u2014 tennis stars Serena and Venus Williams, four-time gymnastics gold medalist Simone Biles and women\u2019s basketball standout Elena Delle Donne \u2014 and promised more leaks would be forthcoming. \n \n WADA said in a statement that the hacking group was able to access passwords to its Rio Olympic database via spear-phishing, the practice by which computers are infected after a user opens an email that is thought to be from a trusted source. \n \n \u201cWADA deeply regrets this situation and is very conscious of the threat that it represents to athletes whose confidential information has been divulged through this criminal act,\u201d Director General Olivier Niggli said in the statement. \u201cWe are reaching out to stakeholders \u2026 regarding the specific athletes impacted.\u201d \n \n The data release comes as the FBI is conducting a broad investigation into Russian government hacking and influence operations in the United States, including a possible effort to undermine confidence in the U.S. elections. The latest incident appears to be part of a larger campaign of strategic releases of hacked material by the Russian government to embarrass victims or raise doubts about their integrity, analysts said. \n \n It comes after nearly every member of that country\u2019s track and field team was banned from this year\u2019s Olympics after numerous investigations uncovered a widespread, government-run doping scheme that dated back years. \n \n \u201cThey\u2019re trying to sow doubt over the integrity of the individual athletes and the various Olympic bodies and watchdog groups,\u201d said Rich Barger, chief information officer at ThreatConnect, a cybersecurity company. \u201cIt\u2019s just ultimately sour grapes. What we\u2019re seeing here is a digital temper tantrum.\u201d \n \n The information released mostly involves Therapeutic Use Exemptions, situations in which WADA allows athletes to take certain banned substances if they\u2019re used to treat legitimate medical issues. \n \n In a statement to Newsweek, the International Olympic Committee said none of the athletes mentioned in the hack had done anything wrong. \n \n \u201cThe IOC strongly condemns such methods which clearly aim at tarnishing the reputation of clean athletes,\u201d the organization said. \u201cThe IOC can confirm, however, that the athletes mentioned did not violate any anti-doping rules during the Olympic Games Rio 2016.\u201d \n \n The hacking group, which is known as Fancy Bear or APT28, works for the military intelligence service GRU. It was one of two Russian spy groups that hacked the Democratic National Committee and may be linked to the release of embarrassing DNC emails by WikiLeaks in July. It has also been active in propaganda operations, researchers say. And last year it hacked the French TV5Monde station, knocking the network off the air for 18 hours in April 2015. \n \n In its statement, WADA said one of the victims whose password was stolen was Yuliya Stepanova, a whistleblower who exposed widespread doping in Russia athletics. \n \n \u201cWe will start with the U.S. team which has disgraced its name by tainted victories,\u201d the group said on a website that exposed the hacked WADA documents. \u201cWe will also disclose exclusive information about other national Olympic teams later. Wait for sensational proof of famous athletes taking doping substances any time soon.\u201d",

The hackers claimed the exemptions were \"licenses for doping.\" WADA says it believes the attacks were carried out with a \"spear-phishing\" attack that gathered passwords with emails to authorized users that convinced them to click on infected links. According to the leaked documents, Biles uses medication to treat ADHD. \"Having ADHD, and taking medicine for it is nothing to be ashamed of\" and \"nothing that I'm afraid to let people know,\" she tweeted in response. Venus Williams, who was diagnosed with the autoimmune disease Sjogren's syndrome in 2011, issued a statement saying she followed all the rules and was disappointed \"that my private, medical data has been compromised by hackers and published without my permission.\" The Fancy Bears group is believed to be linked to the Russian military intelligence agency suspected of hacking the DNC, reports the New York Times, which notes that the Kremlin \"has gone to to great lengths to maintain plausible deniability in matters of espionage\"\u2014and denies involvement in the WADA hack.

U.S. President Barack Obama pauses while speaking about the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, during a press briefing at the White House in Washington December 14, 2012. \n \n WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama urged Americans on Saturday to join in solidarity as they mourn the victims of a shooting rampage at a Connecticut elementary school, saying the hearts of parents across the country were \"heavy with hurt\" for the lives lost. \n \n In his weekly radio and Internet speech, Obama also repeated a message he put forth on Friday, just hours after one of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history, on the need to set aside politics and \"take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this.\" \n \n But Obama went no further than that, and again stopped short of specifically calling for tighter gun-control laws. \n \n Twenty children were killed by a heavily armed gunman who opened fire at a school in Newtown, Connecticut, on Friday. He killed at least 26 people there before turning his gun on himself. \n \n \"We grieve for the families of those we lost. And we keep in our prayers the parents of those who survived,\" Obama said. \n \n The shooting spree reignited a debate over gun-control in a country with a flourishing gun culture and a strong gun lobby, which has discouraged most politicians from any major efforts to address the easy availability of firearms. \n \n Obama mostly steered clear of the issue during his successful re-election campaign this year, and it remains unclear whether he might be willing to take a more assertive approach now that he has secured a second term. \n \n OBAMA URGED TO ACT \n \n New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who runs a coalition of mayors on gun policy, said on Friday the Democratic president should press ahead despite likely opposition from Republicans who control the U.S. House of Representatives. \n \n \"We have heard all the rhetoric before. What we have not seen is leadership - not from the White House and not from Congress. That must end today,\" Bloomberg said in a statement. \n \n Ticking off some of the recent shooting incidents, Obama said in his Saturday address: \"As a nation, we have endured far too many of these tragedies in the last few years.\" \n \n His response to previous high-profile shootings was to call for a national conversation on how to curb gun violence. \n \n \"This weekend, Michelle and I are doing what I know every parent is doing - holding our children as close as we can and reminding them how much we love them,\" he said. \n \n \"There are families in Connecticut who can't do that today. And they need all of us now,\" he said. \"All of us can extend a hand to those in need - to remind them that we are there for them, that we are praying for them.\" \n \n The 20-year-old gunman, who law enforcement sources identified as Adam Lanza, opened fire on a classroom at Sandy Hook Elementary School, which serves children from ages 5 to 10. \n \n Authorities found 18 children and seven adults, including the gunman, dead at the school, and two children were pronounced dead later after being taken to a hospital. \n \n \"Most of those who died were just young children with their whole lives ahead of them. And every parent in America has a heart heavy with hurt,\" Obama said. \n \n Obama had to struggle to control his emotions during his televised statement on Friday in the White House briefing where his voice cracked and he wiped away tears. \n \n Partisan bickering in Washington, divided by a battle over a looming \"fiscal cliff\" of tax hikes and spending cuts, was put on hold amid mourning for the Connecticut dead. \n \n House Speaker John Boehner, the top Republican in Congress, said he had canceled the Republican weekly address for Saturday \"so that President Obama can speak for the entire nation at this time of mourning.\" \n \n (Reporting By Matt Spetalnick; Editing by David Brunnstrom) ||||| President Obama devotes his weekly radio address to the elementary school shooting in Newtown, Conn., urging \"meaningful action\" to combat gun violence.

We have heard all the rhetoric before.

A gunman opened fire near an arms shop, leaving six people dead and one injured. A 14-year-old girl is among those killed. \n \n Police have asked Belgorod residents not to leave their homes because of the special operation. The photo of the suspect \u2013 Sergey Pomazun, 32 \u2013 and his description have been posted on the internet. Law enforcers also warn that the man at large may be armed with a gas pistol and a semi-automatic rifle. \n \n \n \n Local authorities say that some 1200 police personnel are engaged in the search for the fugitive. \n \n Authorities have also sent a description of the suspect to the Interior Ministry of Ukraine in Kharkiv, Luhansk and Sumy regions. Border and customs controls have also been placed on high alert. \n \n Russia\u2019s Interior Ministry has set a big reward for information about the suspect. \n \n \n \n Belgorod authorities earlier stated that the suspect had been detained by police. However, they then said that the report was published on the local administration\u2019s website by mistake. \n \n \u201cInformation on the detention of the suspect has not been confirmed, the Interior Ministry told us two minutes ago,\u201d the city administration\u2019s press service told Interfax. \n \n The man is still at large. Currently, law enforcers are checking vehicles and housing estates in Belgorod and its outskirts, the regional Interior Ministry Department said. \n \n \n \n His residence was earlier cordoned off by police. While searching the suspect\u2019s apartment, investigators discovered an open safe used for storing weapons, but found it empty. No weapon was located in the gunman\u2019s abandoned car either. \n \n About 2pm local time (10:00 GMT) the gunman drove up to a shop in a dark BMW X5. Getting out of the car, he opened fire in the street and then inside the shop. He then managed to flee the scene in his vehicle. \n \n As a result of the shooting rampage, four men aged between 28 and 45, and two schoolgirls were killed, police said. One of the girls, a 16-year-old, was taken to a local hospital, but died later in the ICU. She would turn 17 in just over two weeks - on May 9. \n \n The Belgorod shooter allegedly used a Kalashnikov-based semi-automatic 7.62 caliber Saiga carbine, popular with hunters, reports Lifenews tabloid. \n \n Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin is being kept informed on the development of the situation, his press secretary Dmitry Peskov told journalists. \n \n The city administration has declared April 23 and 24 days of mourning in Belgorod. The authorities will also cover all the funeral expenses and provide financial aid to the families of the victims. \n \n Russia\u2019s Emergencies Ministry sent a team of psychologists to the city to help the grieving relatives to cope with the tragedy. \n \n All churches in Belgorod region will hold memorial services for those killed in the shooting. \n \n Meanwhile, the residents of the city \u2013 known to be very calm and quiet \u2013 remain shocked by Monday\u2019s tragedy. Police presence was beefed up in Belgorod with sounds of sirens breaking the silence in now almost empty streets. \n \n The suspect has a criminal record and has earlier been convicted four times, \u201cmainly for thefts,\u201d a source at regional Interior Ministry Told Interfax. It is alleged that he attempted to rob the arms shop. \n \n Conflicting reports suggest there were two suspects in the shooting, with witnesses having seen them according to some media reports. The two may have reportedly been father and son. \n \n According to law enforcers though, the suspect\u2019s father, Aleksandr Pomazun, is actively cooperating with investigators. \n \n \u201cInitially, [the father] was put on a wanted list, as the BMW that Sergey Pomazun drove in to the shop was registered on Aleksandr\u2019s name,\u201d the regional Interior Ministry told Interfax. \u201cBut soon Aleksandr\u2019s whereabouts were identified and he gave detailed evidence during questioning.\u201d \n \n Some media also stated that earlier the shooting suspect had undergone treatment at a psychiatric clinic. It was reported he had been sentenced to compulsory treatment by a court. However, the regional Investigative Committee did not confirm that information. \n \n On the eve of the bloodshed, Pomazun managed to escape road police after he violated driving regulations by driving on the opposite side of the lane and ignoring a red traffic light at a junction, reported Life News tabloid. \n \n Belgorod is a city with a population of over 420,000 people. It is located in the south of Russia\u2019s European part, just 40km from the border with Ukraine. \n \n An amateur video from the scene shows a killed person lying on the ground. \n \n \n \n Locals say the shooting sparked panic among residents. \n \n \n \n Elena Petrenko - a witness to the drama, who works in a close-by supermarket - says they heard the shooting, which they at first confused for fireworks before looking out of the window. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s a school near [the shooting scene]. Children were running asunder and screaming,\u201d she told RIA Novosti, adding that the area is generally very crowded with people as there are shops and a central market there. \n \n \u201cA woman with a baby carriage and a child in her arms tried to run into a shop, but the salesmen closed the door right in front of her,\u201d the witness added. \n \n \u201cEmployees of [a nearby] Sberbank office want to close the bank because of the incident. Connection is down. They are panicking,\u201d \u200f@anastasiaskull posted on twitter. \n \n Police have \u201ccordoned off the area,\u201d says user @Angelina1Lina11. \u201cDamn! I\u2019m only 2-3 minutes far from home. It freaks me out.\u201d \n \n \n \n \u201cEveryone who lives in Belgorod, be careful,\u201d warns @Lizaveta_31. \u201cI was called up and told not to leave house. We\u2019ve got shooting here.\u201d \n \n \u201cThe reports are conflicting! So don\u2019t believe anything, just keep safe! Don\u2019t risk your lives!\u201d adds another local resident, @TranceR1. \n \n Dozens of Belgorod residents came to the scene of the tragedy events bringing flowers and candles to commemorate the six victims. (Watch the video below posted on YouTube by Mir Belogorya) \n \n \n \n \n \n Legally acquired hunting weapons are used only in a tiny fraction of crimes registered in Russia, according to the police. Mass public shootings are also relatively rare, however, there have been several such cases in the last three years. \n \n According to Russia\u2019s gun laws, Russian citizens can only buy smoothbore shotguns, gas pistols, or traumatic rubber-bullet revolvers. After five years of safe use of any of the above weapons one is allowed to purchase a rifle or carbine. However, merely having a gun license does not allow a citizen to carry a rifle \u2013 it is also obligatory to become a member of a hunting-and-fishing club. \n \n \n \n In November 2012, a Moscow lawyer shot six of his coworkers to death in an office over a broken relationship with a female colleague. Before the rampage, he also posted an online \u2018hate manifesto\u2019 on his Facebook page. The killer obtained a firearms certificate illegally, and it allowed him to carry two sporting guns to the scene of the crime \u2013 one of which turned out to be a rifle with 200 rounds of ammunition. \n \n Another case that sparked public outrage and enjoyed unprecedented media attention in Russia was a shooting spree and hostage drama in a Moscow supermarket staged by a district police department chief. \n \n The \u2018killer cop\u2019 gunned down two people and endangered lives of 22 others, injuring seven in the massacre. He also used an illegally-kept pistol to shoot at the approaching police and told them \u201cit would be more fun if I had a machine gun\u201d after he was detained. \n \n \n \n It remained unclear, whether the policeman got drunk while celebrating his birthday, or if he had some mental disorder, which the court eventually ruled out before sentencing the man to life in prison.",

    "document": "Video \n \n When and how long a baby looks at other people\u2019s eyes offers the earliest behavioral sign to date of whether a child is likely to develop autism, scientists are reporting. \n \n In a study published Wednesday, researchers using eye-tracking technology found that children who were found to have autism at age 3 looked less at people\u2019s eyes when they were babies than children who did not develop autism. But contrary to what the researchers expected, the difference was not apparent at birth. It emerged in the next few months and autism experts said that might suggest a window during which the progression toward autism can be halted or slowed. \n \n The study, published online in the journal Nature, found that infants who later developed autism began spending less time looking at people\u2019s eyes between 2 and 6 months of age and paid less attention to eyes as they grew older. By contrast, babies who did not develop autism looked increasingly at people\u2019s eyes until about 9 months old, and then kept their attention to eyes fairly constant into toddlerhood. \n \n \u201cThis paper is a major leap forward,\u201d said Dr. Lonnie Zwaigenbaum, a pediatrician and autism researcher at the University of Alberta, who was not involved in the study. \u201cDocumenting that there\u2019s a developmental difference between 2 and 6 months is a major, major finding.\u201d \n \n The authors, Warren R. Jones and Ami Klin, both of the Marcus Autism Center and Emory University, also found that babies who showed the steepest decline in looking at people\u2019s eyes over time developed the most severe autism. \n \n \u201cKids whose eye fixation falls off most rapidly are the ones who later on are the most socially disabled and show the most symptoms,\u201d said Dr. Jones, director of research at the autism center. \u201cThese are the earliest known signs of social disability, and they are associated with outcome and with symptom severity. Our ultimate goal is to translate this discovery into a tool for early identification\u201d of children with autism. \n \n The eye-tracking differences are not something parents and pediatricians would be able to perceive without the technology and expertise of an autism clinic, Dr. Jones said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to create concern in parents that if a child isn\u2019t looking them in the eyes all the time, it\u2019s a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not. Children are looking all over the place.\u201d \n \n Autism therapies have not yet been developed for young babies, but there are efforts to adapt intensive behavioral therapy for use with children as young as 12 months, Dr. Jones said. \n \n Diagnoses of autism have increased, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, from one child in 150 in 2002 to one in 88 in 2008. The reasons are unclear, although some factors could be greater awareness of the disorder and a growing number of older fathers. \n \n Dr. Jones and Dr. Klin, who directs the autism center, studied two groups of babies. One group was at high risk for autism, with a 20 times greater likelihood of developing it because they had siblings with the disorder. The other group was at low risk, with no relatives with autism. \n \n The researchers assessed 110 children, from 2 months to 2 years of age, 10 times while watching videos of friendly women acting like playful caregivers. Eye-tracking technology traced when the babies looked at the women\u2019s eyes, mouths and bodies, as well as toys or other objects in the background. At age 3, the children were evaluated for autism. Ultimately, researchers used data from 36 boys, 11 of whom developed autism. (They excluded data from girls because only two developed autism.) \n \n While the number of children studied was small \u2014 and the researchers are now studying more children \u2014 experts not involved in the study said the results were significant because of the careful and repeated measurements that were not just snapshots, but showed change over time. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s well done and very important,\u201d said Dr. Geraldine Dawson, director of the Center for Autism Diagnosis and Treatment at Duke University. She said it was notable that \u201cearly on these babies look quite normal; this really gives us a clue to brain development.\u201d \n \n She said a possible explanation was that early in life, activities like looking at faces are essentially reflexes \u201ccontrolled by lower cortical regions of the brain that are likely intact\u201d in children with autism. But \u201cas the brain develops, babies begin to use these behaviors in a more intentional way. They can look at what they want to look at. We think that these higher cortical regions are the ones that are not working the same\u201d as in typical children. \n \n Dr. John N. Constantino, a child psychiatrist and pediatrician at Washington University in St. Louis, said the study showed that \u201cbabies who develop autism are for the most part doing an awful lot of things right for the first few months.\u201d Perhaps the genes that drive autism begin to derail typical development after that, so that \u201cwhat you are looking at moment by moment, day by day, second by second, is completely different from what other children are looking at, and the cumulative experience is what sends you off into the trajectory of autism.\u201d \n \n The researchers found that children who developed autism paid somewhat more attention to mouths and sustained attention to bodies past the age when typical children became less interested. Even more noticeable was that children who developed autism looked more at objects after the first year, while typical children\u2019s interest in objects declined. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re measuring what babies see, but more importantly we\u2019re measuring what they don\u2019t see,\u201d Dr. Jones said. \n \n Dr. Dawson said that looking at people teaches babies about \u201cfacial expressions and language and gesture. If the baby who\u2019s developing autism is paying attention to objects, they\u2019re really losing out on those opportunities.\u201d \n \n Before this study, experts said, research found that potential signs of autism \u2014 including differences in temperament, eye contact and pointing out objects \u2014 could be detected late in a child\u2019s first year. Most cases of autism in children are diagnosed between ages 3 and 5, although the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening children at between 18 and 24 months. \n \n But the new study suggests the need to develop therapies that begin even earlier. \u201cThe train has long left the station if you don\u2019t start intervention until 18 months,\u201d Dr. Constantino said. \n \n Dr. Jones said eye contact was \u201cjust one very important channel.\u201d \n \n He continued, \u201cI think we\u2019d see the same things if we were measuring a child\u2019s social reciprocity via touch or auditory listening preferences, but those are harder to measure.\u201d \n \n He and Dr. Klin advocate the eventual use of eye tracking and other measures in social development growth charts, similar to height and weight charts. Still, the authors and other experts cautioned that the results required confirmation in many more children. \n \n Autism is so complex and varied that eye-tracking is unlikely to be able to identify every condition on the autism spectrum, Dr. Zwaigenbaum and others said. But they said the study helped illustrate the need for therapies to increase social engagement among very young infants, \u201ceither by intensifying the experience for them or making it pleasurable in other ways,\u201d Dr. Constantino said. \n \n \u201cIt really does present an opportunity for seeing if we could do some preventative interventions,\u201d said Dr. Sally Ozonoff, vice chairwoman for research in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the MIND Institute of the University of California, Davis. \u201cMaybe you could keep the child from heading into that decline, so it doesn\u2019t turn into autism.\u201d ||||| Image copyright Kay Hinton/Emory University Image caption Eye tracking experiments were used to detect signs of autism \n \n An early indication of autism can be identified in babies under six months old, a study suggests. \n \n US researchers, writing in Nature, analysed how infants looked at faces from birth to the age of three. \n \n They found children later diagnosed with autism initially developed normally but showed diminished eye contact - a hallmark of autism - between two and six months of age. \n \n A UK expert said the findings raise hope for early interventions. \n \n In the study, researchers led by Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta used eye-tracking technology to measure the way babies looked at and responded to social clues. \n \n These early markers are extremely important for us to identify - the earlier we can diagnose a child who has one of these disorders - such as autism - the earlier we can provide intervention and development Dr Deborah Riby, Durham University \n \n They found infants later diagnosed with autism had shown a steady decline in attention to the eyes of other people from the age of two months onwards, when watching videos of natural human interactions. \n \n Lead researcher Dr Warren Jones told BBC News: \"It tells us for the first time that it's possible to detect some signs of autism in the first months of life. \n \n \"These are the earliest signs of autism that we've ever observed.\" \n \n The study, in collaboration with the Marcus Autism Center and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, followed 59 infants who had a high risk of autism because they had siblings with the life-long condition, and 51 infants at low risk. \n \n Dr Jones and colleague Dr Ami Klin followed them to the age of three, when the children were formally assessed for autism. \n \n Thirteen of the children were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders - a range of disorders that includes autism and Asperger's syndrome - 11 boys and two girls. \n \n The researchers then went back to look at the eye-tracking data, and what they found was surprising. \n \n \"In infants with autism, eye contact is declining already in the first six months of life,\" said Dr Jones. \n \n But he added this could be seen only with sophisticated technology and would not be visible to parents. \n \n \"It's not something that parents would be able to see by themselves at all. If parents have concerns they should talk to their paediatrician.\" \n \n Dr Deborah Riby, of the department of psychology at Durham University, said the study provided an insight into the timing of atypical social attention in children who might go on to develop autism. \n \n Autism spectrum disorders Autism and Asperger's syndrome are part of a range of related developmental disorders known as autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) \n \n They begin in childhood and last through adulthood. \n \n ASD can cause a wide range of symptoms, which are grouped into three categories including problems with social interaction, impaired communication skills and unusual patterns of thought and behaviour Source: NHS Choices \n \n \"These early markers are extremely important for us to identify - the earlier we can diagnose a child who has one of these disorders - such as autism - the earlier we can provide intervention and development,\" she said. \n \n Caroline Hattersley, head of information, advice and advocacy at the National Autistic Society, said the research was \"based on a very small sample and needs to be replicated on a far larger scale before any concrete conclusions can be drawn\". \n \n \"Autism is a very complex condition,\" she said. \n \n \"No two people with autism are the same, and so a holistic approach to diagnosis is required that takes into account all aspects of an individual's behaviour. A more comprehensive approach allows all of a person's support needs to be identified. \n \n \"It's vital that everyone with autism can access a diagnosis, as it can be key to unlocking the right support which can enable people with the condition to reach their full potential.\" \n \n The research is published in the journal Nature. ||||| By Serena Gordon \n \n HealthDay Reporter \n \n WEDNESDAY, Nov. 6 (HealthDay News) -- At least one sign of autism may begin as early as 2 months of life, new research suggests. \n \n The study of 110 babies found that infants later diagnosed with autism showed a decline in the amount of attention they paid to other people's eyes beginning at 2 months and continuing until 24 months. \n \n \"We found that signs of autism are measurable and observable within the first months of life,\" said study author Warren Jones, director of research at the Marcus Autism Center at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. \n \n \"These are the earliest signs of autism ever observed,\" Jones said, noting they may be associated with symptom severity. \n \n Children with autism have impaired communication and social skills and often exhibit repetitive behaviors. Symptoms may be mild, as in Asperger syndrome, or severe, as in full-blown autism. It's estimated that one in 88 U.S. children has an autism spectrum disorder. \n \n Despite the observed decline in eye attention, the researchers said infants later diagnosed with autism did pay more attention to people's eyes than was expected. \n \n \"This insight, the preservation of some early eye-looking, is important because, in the future, if we were able to use similar technologies to identify early signs of social disability, we could then consider interventions to build on that early eye-looking and help reduce some of the associated disabilities that often accompany autism,\" said Jones. \n \n Autism therapies work best when begun while the brain is still developing. \"This early developmental window may be an opportunity to intervene that we didn't know we had before,\" Jones added. \n \n The findings, released online Nov. 6 as a letter in the journal Nature, need to be confirmed in larger studies before they can lead to changes in clinical practice. \n \n Deficits in eye contact are a key sign of autism spectrum disorders, according to background information in the study. But it wasn't clear when such deficits begin. \n \n Currently, autism is often diagnosed using a scientifically validated checklist designed for youngsters between 16 months and 30 months old, according to Autism Speaks. \n \n For the study, the researchers enrolled 59 babies considered to be at high risk of developing an autism spectrum disorder because they had a sibling with autism. Another 51 babies were enrolled who were considered low-risk. \n \n To see if they could pinpoint when lack of interest in other people's eyes begins, the research team used eye-tracking technology to measure the babies' focus when shown videos of caregivers engaged in normal behaviors. \n \n The babies were shown the videos at 10 time points between 2 months and 2 years of age. \n \n By age 3, just one child from the low-risk group was later diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, compared to 12 youngsters in the high-risk group. Because just two of these children were female, the researchers limited their analysis to the 11 male children diagnosed with autism. They compared them to 25 typically developing children from the low-risk group. \n \n The researchers noted that the decline in interest in other people's eyes began at 2 months and continued declining until 2 years. \n \n One expert called the findings a significant advance. \n \n \"This was a very well-done, very revealing study documenting in a precise and systematic way that children who are later diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders have demonstrable and progressive differences in visual regard in infancy. It's a breakthrough finding,\" said Dr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at Steven & Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York in New Hyde Park, N.Y. \n \n \"Whether this might permit accurate and reliable diagnosis earlier is still very unclear. But if it does lead to earlier identification, it may lead to the development of earlier interventions,\" he said. \n \n Jones pointed out that these deficits aren't something that parents would be able to see on their own. \"This is not something a parent can see by just holding a baby. We collected many measurements over time,\" he explained. \n \n \"Parents shouldn't be concerned if their babies aren't looking at them 100 percent of the time, but if they do have persistent concerns, they should talk to their child's pediatrician,\" advised Jones.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A new autism study makes what looks to be a significant discovery: The first signs show up as early as two months of age in the form of reduced eye contact by babies, reports the New York Times. If the findings hold up, they could provide doctors with the earliest warning yet that a child is developing the disorder\u2014a big deal because research suggests that the earlier treatment begins, the more effective it is. The study \"tells us for the first time that it's possible to detect some signs of autism in the first months of life,\" one of the Emory University researchers tells the BBC. \"These are the earliest signs of autism that we've ever observed.\" The researchers studied two groups of kids from birth to age 2 with sophisticated eye-tracking technology. One of the groups was deemed high risk because of a sibling with autism. The researchers then went back when the kids were 3 and found a clear correlation between those who had been recently diagnosed with autism and their eye contact as babies. The dropoff began between two and six months of age, and the more severe it was, the more severe the case of autism. An autism researcher not involved with the study called it a \"major, major finding.\" The researchers say this isn't something parents would likely be able to notice on their own, notes HealthDay via US News & Report. Nor do they want parents to panic if their child isn't maintaining constant eye contact. But \"if they do have persistent concerns, they should talk to their child's pediatrician,\" adds one.",

    "document": "Enlarge Image Steven Ewing/Roadshow \n \n The turn signal is a marvelous invention. It elegantly communicates your intent to move your 4,000-pound guided missile from one space to another, thus minimizing the chance that the driver of a similar missile will be occupying the same space. It's like magic, but I live in Los Angeles where nobody uses their signals and that's why this new Tesla patent filing is especially exciting. \n \n Tesla wants its vehicles to signal automatically without the driver needing to go through the agony that is lifting their finger and moving it up or down by several inches. The way that Tesla envisions it working is that the car detects the driver's intent to change lanes or make a turn by using the Autopilot hardware at its disposal, it then works to sense if there are other vehicles nearby and if it detects them, it puts the signal on for the driver. \n \n Cool, right? \n \n If it works, it will be brilliant but given the fact that Tesla has remained adamant that it doesn't need driver monitoring systems for Autopilot, it seems questionable that the vehicle would be able to detect a driver's intent to turn based solely on external observation. \n \n There are plenty of systems out now from other manufacturers that will offer drivers a warning to use their signals after repeated turns or lane changes without them, but because those ultimately rely on the driver moving their finger and physically activating the signal, they're not that helpful. People are just lazy, what can we say? \n \n Enlarge Image Tesla \n \n Anyway, I hope this patent actually makes it into a vehicle, since many patents don't. They're most often secured by manufacturers as a means of hampering the competition's ability to develop a technology but in this case, if it works, it could really do some good. \n \n We've reached out to Tesla for additional information on this patent, but it has not immediately responded to requests for comment. ||||| Tesla has filed for a new patent that describes a technology to automate turn signals. \n \n Surprisingly, it sounds like the technology is actually not for self-driving cars, but for drivers who forget/don\u2019t use turn signals. \n \n It has happened to most of us at one point or another. \n \n A car swerves in your lane without signaling or a car slows down to take an exit without activating their turn signal. \n \n At best, it\u2019s annoying and at worst, it\u2019s dangerous. \n \n Tesla appears to have a solution. By leveraging its Autopilot technology, the automaker thinks it can detect when a driver should activate its turn signal and do it for them if they forget it. \n \n The company describes the system in the patent application: \n \n \u201cAn embodiment includes a method of automated turn signaling, the method comprising: determining, via the processor, that a vehicle will cross a lane line or turn based on a measured steering angle value that is within a value range stored in a memory, wherein the car includes the processor, the memory, and the turn signal source; and activating, via the processor, the turn signal source based on the determination that a vehicle will cross a lane line or turn.\u201d \n \n Here\u2019s a flowchart that explains when the system would activate the turn signal for the driver: \n \n Tesla has applied for an international patent to use its sensors and onboard processor to make this work. There\u2019s no word on when or even if the technology will make its way into Tesla\u2019s vehicles. \n \n Here\u2019s the full patent application: \n \n Electrek\u2019s Take \n \n It sounds like Tesla might have been working on detecting when it should activate its turn signal when the vehicle is driving automatically and figured out that it could also be useful technology when drivers are manually driving their vehicles. \n \n Of course, it\u2019s not a reason to not activate your turn signal since any good driver knows that you should activate it before taking any action and not when you are just about to cross a lane line, but it is certainly better than no turn signal at all. \n \n As for automated turn signals for autonomous driving, Tesla is definitely working on that too since the company said that it plans to release the Autopilot \u2018On Ramp/Off Ramp\u2019 feature in the version 9.0 update next month. \n \n The feature would reportedly enable Autopilot to drive on its own on the highway without inputs from the driver, including lanes changes. \n \n Currently, Tesla drivers can initiate a lane change on Autopilot but they have to make sure the way is clear and activate the turn signal \u2013 only then will Autopilot drive the car in the next lane.",

    "document": "(Reuters Health) - Skin cancers caused by indoor tanning are responsible for $343 million a year in direct medical costs for U.S. patients, a recent study suggests. \n \n On top of those direct healthcare costs, lost productivity and early deaths among patients with melanoma and other malignancies tied to tanning bed use will exceed $127 billion over the lifetime of the people currently diagnosed with these cancers, the study also found. \n \n \u201cWe already knew that the use of indoor tanning devices is damaging to health and can cause cancer, but we did not have a comprehensive documentation of the health impacts at the population level or an estimate of the costs of health care to treat these conditions,\u201d said study co-author Hugh Waters of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \n \n An estimated 30 million people in the U.S. use tanning beds at least once a year, and they have approximately 25,000 tanning salons nationwide to choose from, researchers note in the Journal of Cancer Policy. \n \n To estimate the health costs associated with indoor tanning, researchers tallied the average costs to treat skin malignancies including melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma. \n \n Based on previously published estimates of the increased cancer risk associated with tanning beds, they also calculated the proportion of cases of these cancers that is attributable to indoor tanning. \n \n With data on the prevalence of tanning device use in the U.S., they were able to calculate the number of skin cancer cases caused by tanning beds and the associated costs for treatment in 2015. \n \n That year, tanning beds were linked to 8,947 cases of melanoma, more than 168,000 cases of squamous cell carcinoma and at least 86,000 cases of basal cell carcinoma. \n \n Based on data from Medicare, the U.S. health insurance program for the elderly, researchers calculated that the average 2015 cost of treating melanoma was $5,054 per case and the typical cost for other skin cancers was $1,168. \n \n In addition to these medical costs, researchers calculated the economic loss over the lifetime of individuals currently diagnosed with these cancers based on what they described as the value of a lost year of life. \n \n This estimate was calculated based on the size of the U.S. population and on a measure of the size of the economy known as gross domestic product (GDP) in 2015. Under this formula, a year of life lost resulted in a $55,266 reduction in GDP. \n \n It\u2019s possible the study underestimated the number of skin cancers associated with indoor tanning, the authors note. Their cost estimates also didn\u2019t include long-term medical and productivity costs associated with follow-up physician visits or additional care. \n \n However, it\u2019s also possible the study overestimated the economic costs associated with indoor tanning, said Dr. David Leffell, a researcher at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \n \n \u201cI believe that the health risks and costs of natural sun exposure exceed those of indoor tanning substantially,\u201d Leffell added by email. \n \n All unprotected exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays can increase the risk of developing skin cancer, noted Dr. Elizabeth Martin, president of Pure Dermatology and Aesthetics in Hoover, Alabama, and a researcher at the University of Alabama School of Medicine. \n \n \u201cThe cost of treating skin cancer is the same regardless of whether the patient used indoor tanning or tanned outdoors,\u201d Martin, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email. \n \n Tanning beds, however, can make melanoma, the deadliest type of skin cancer, more likely, and the risk increases with more tanning sessions, Martin said. \n \n The risk is stark for young women. \n \n \u201cWomen younger than 30 are six times more likely to develop melanoma if they tan indoors,\u201d Martin noted. \u201cEven one indoor tanning session can increase users\u2019 risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma by 67 percent and basal cell carcinoma by 29 percent.\u201d \n \n SOURCE: bit.ly/2lkInK7 Journal of Cancer Policy, online February 28, 2017. ||||| Tanning beds can ring up a steep bill \u2014 a whopping $343 million each year in medical costs in the US alone. \n \n Indoor tanning has long been tied to skin cancer, the most common type of cancer in the US. It\u2019s estimated that 30 million people \u2014 nearly 25 percent of whom are teenagers \u2014 head to tanning beds at least once a year. \n \n And the health care costs of the habit can add up, health economists report in a new study published Tuesday in the Journal of Cancer Policy. \n \n advertisement \n \n Tanning beds emit UV-A rays, which can damage DNA, and UV-B rays, which can burn the skin and increase the risk of skin cancer. Research has shown that indoor tanning before age 35 raises the risk of melanoma up to 75 percent. \n \n Health care researchers at the University of North Carolina focused on melanoma and two other types of skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. \n \n The researchers looked at all skin cancer cases in 2015, and then applied data on indoor tanning prevalence and relative risk of skin cancer after using a tanning bed to those numbers. They estimated that there were 263,600 cases of skin cancer in 2015 that could be attributed to the use of tanning beds. \n \n The researchers then summed up the average annual cost of treating patients with each type of cancer, which totaled more than $343 million each year. \n \n \u201cOur findings highlight both the negative health and negative financial impacts associated with indoor tanning,\u201d the authors wrote. \n \n The Food and Drug Administration has taken steps in recent years to rein in use of tanning beds. In 2014, the agency announced that manufacturers would be required to put a black-box warning on tanning beds that states they shouldn\u2019t be used by anyone under 18. The FDA also classified tanning beds as moderate-risk products in 2014, giving health officials the authority to review tanning beds for safety before they hit the market. \n \n The Affordable Care Act aimed to reduce use of tanning beds, too, by implementing a 10 percent excise tax on indoor tanning services. \n \n A couple caveats: The new numbers are just an estimation \u2014 it\u2019s impossible to nail down the cause of each individual case of skin cancer. The results also don\u2019t include costs associated with other health problems blamed on tanning beds, such as burns. \n \n But the study\u2019s authors said they are hopeful that putting an estimate on the social costs of indoor tanning will help reduce use of the devices.",

What's more, they figure that early deaths and loss of productivity in these cases add up to a $127.3 billion loss over the lifetime of individuals currently diagnosed. But those are just dollar signs: the human toll is large, too, with more than 263,000 cases of skin cancer attributed to tanning beds in 2015 alone. The researchers call tanning beds a \"significant contributor to illness and premature mortality in the US.\" Reuters notes that some 30 million Americans use tanning beds every year. Tanning beds emit UV-A rays, which damage DNA, and UV-B rays, which can burn one's skin and also raise the risk of skin cancer. (The research did not calculate the medical cost of burns.) Previous research has found that indoor tanning bed exposure in people younger than 35 nearly doubles their risk of melanoma, reports STAT News, and Americans must now be 18 or older to use them in several states. \"Women younger than 30 are six times more likely to develop melanoma if they tan indoors,\" says a University of Alabama researcher who wasn't involved in the study. \"Even one indoor tanning session can increase users' risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma by 67% and basal cell carcinoma by 29%.\" (Australia has outright banned tanning beds.)",
    "generated_summary": "Tanning beds are linked to 8,947 cases of melanoma and more than 168,000 cases of squamous cell carcinoma. Tanning beds can make melanoma, the deadliest type of skin cancer, more likely. An estimated 30 million people in the U.S. use tanning beds at least once a year. The cost of treating skin cancer is the same regardless of whether the patient used indoor tanning or tanned outdoors, Dr. Elizabeth Martin of Pure Dermatology and Aesthetics in Hoover, Alabama, says. It\u2019s possible the study underestimated the number of skin cancers associated with tanning.",

It is neither a technology company nor a media company, he says. \n \n \u201cTwitter is an entirely new thing,\u201d Mr. McCue says. \u201cI like the fact that Twitter is unapologetic to that. Dick is the same way with his decisions.\u201d \n \n Twitter has defended the privacy of its users. It has taken on New York City courts to protect the identities of Occupy Wall Street protesters, and gone up against the United States Justice Department, which tried to gain information about WikiLeaks supporters. \n \n \u201cNo one wants a pen that\u2019s going to rat them out,\u201d says Alexander Macgillivray, Twitter\u2019s chief lawyer. \u201cWe all want pens that can be used to write anything, and that will stand up for who we are.\u201d \n \n IN Twitter\u2019s early days, Mr. Stone, nicknamed Biz, said this of the company\u2019s growth: \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re on a rocket ship that we were just painting, and suddenly it took off and we\u2019re holding onto the ship with our fingernails.\u201d \n \n Nowadays, Mr. Costolo is the one trying to steer that rocket. \n \n He didn\u2019t plan to end up at Twitter. In 2009, Mr. Costolo and his wife, Lorin, and their two children grew tired of Chicago\u2019s weather and decided to move to California. He started at Twitter as chief operations officer and became chief executive in 2010, after Mr. Williams, one of the Twitter co-founders, stepped down to focus on other projects. Mr. Williams, who is still on Twitter\u2019s board, and Mr. Stone now run Obvious, a start-up incubator. \n \n Last year, Mr. Costolo brought back Mr. Dorsey, who left the company in 2008 after he struggled to fix engineering problems that knocked Twitter offline for hours at a time. Such problems still occasionally plague the service. \n \n Mr. Dorsey\u2019s role has since been reduced after employees complained that he was difficult to work with and repeatedly changed his mind about product directions. He no longer has anyone directly reporting to him, although he is still involved in strategic decisions. \n \n Mr. Dorsey declined to comment on how people feel about working with him. But, in a statement, he said he considered Mr. Costolo to be one of Twitter\u2019s founders. \u201cHe\u2019s had a dramatic impact on the company and the culture,\u201d Mr. Dorsey said. \u201cHe\u2019s questioned everything we started with and made it better.\u201d \n \n Mr. Costolo says he looks to Mr. Dorsey for ideas and sometimes has to pull them out of him. Although Mr. Dorsey is a regular on the media circuit, appearing on CNN, as well as \u201cCharlie Rose\u201d and other programs, he tends to be quiet in meetings. \n \n \u201cDick does a good job of saying \u2018Jack, what do you think?\u2019 \u201d says Michael Sippey, director of consumer product at Twitter. Mr. Sippey works with Mr. Dorsey to make sure that new features are \u201cTwittery.\u201d \n \n Mr. Costolo\u2019s quick decision-making can be both good for a company that is growing so quickly, but bad for people who move more slowly than him. Employees say he can come across as insensitive. Earlier this year, for example, he ousted a senior employee over the phone to save time. He has also pushed some stockholders off the board. \n \n Mr. Costolo has also evicted some third-party applications from Twitter, a decision that some see as insensitive to early adopters who helped the company grow. \n \n \u201cThe techno-enthusiasts that helped Twitter grow are far less valuable to them today,\u201d says Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Gartner. \u201cIt\u2019s the same way that Apple now cares more about the 10 million consumers than catering to the 10,000 hard-core consumers.\u201d \n \n When Mr. Costolo doesn\u2019t get his way, he tends to bang his fingers on a tablet as if he\u2019s playing an imaginary piano that won\u2019t make any sounds. Even so, his work ethic \u2014 and comedy \u2014 have come to permeate Twitter\u2019s culture. ||||| Twitter Mulls an In-House Video-Hosting Service \n \n If you want something done right, do it yourself. \n \n Twitter is considering building its own video-hosting technology, according to sources. That means users could upload video directly via the service\u2019s mobile apps, instead of using hosting services like yFrog, TwitVid and Vodpod. \n \n That potential change would be in line with a number of tweaks the site has made to its applications throughout 2012. Until recently, Twitter also delegated photo hosting to third-party services; Twitter moved that hosting in-house with the most recent app updates. \n \n Mind you, this doesn\u2019t mean Twitter expects users to start using its homegrown solution for the bulk of the videos people share of the service. It still expects most people to post clips using links from sites like YouTube, Hulu and Vimeo. \n \n People familiar with Twitter\u2019s thinking say the switch would be a way of further refining Twitter\u2019s consistency and user experience, better shaping how users encounter Twitter content. It\u2019s Twitter\u2019s theme over the past year. (Example: The LinkedIn situation from months ago.) \n \n While these video services take some of the heavy lifting off of Twitter, they also create difficulties. For one, Twitter has no control over the changes others make to their products. Yet often, Twitter must deal with the fallout when these changes occur. So, say, a third-party Twitter developer screws something up for its users \u2014 those users don\u2019t necessarily go to the developer with complaints, but instead take it directly to Twitter. \n \n I\u2019d imagine, too, that every time Twitter updates one of its clients, it is frustrating to configure the new version to work with a number of outside hosting services. Add in the fact that Twitter has clients across multiple operating systems, and it fast becomes a logistical headache. \n \n It\u2019s not only about tech problems, but creating better ways to make tweets richer. Over the past few months, Twitter has slowly, increasingly updated the product to be more media-friendly, with full photos, videos and snippets of news articles now viewable from within individual tweets themselves. \n \n Owning that rich video experience has monetization upside. One source says building a more effective video player could be a way of better enhancing the company\u2019s existing advertising products, namely the promoted suite. \n \n Look at it this way: If a big brand buys a promoted tweet, the advertiser needs to make that tweet as compelling as possible to get their money\u2019s worth. The better the tweet, the higher the likelihood of click-through or, at minimum, brand awareness. A simpler, more reliable way for partners to host their video makes for a better, media-rich stream. In theory, it\u2019s good for both users and advertisers. \n \n Who it\u2019s not so good for: These third-party hosting services. Were Twitter to follow through with the plan, this would seriously dampen the number of video uploads these services would receive. Users could still upload video to these third-party services and then add the link in manually, but the loss of official Twitter app integration would sting. \n \n As of today, it\u2019s not a done deal; Folks inside the company are still hashing out whether to make the change. But if it were to come about, I\u2019d expect it to come quietly in a future product update. \n \n (Image courtesy of Juan Manuel Romo)",

    "document": "Getty Images \n \n The Food and Drug Administration announced on Tuesday that it will make a brand of emergency contraception known as Plan B One-Step available over the counter for women ages 15 and older, and with a prescription for younger teens. The pill is currently available over the counter to women ages 17 and older. \n \n \"Research has shown that access to emergency contraceptive products has the potential to further decrease the rate of unintended pregnancies in the United States,\" said FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg in a statement. \"The data reviewed by the agency demonstrated that women 15 years of age and older were able to understand how Plan B One-Step works, how to use it properly, and that it does not prevent the transmission of a sexually transmitted disease.\" \n \n The decision by the FDA only partially complies with a ruling handed down by a federal judge in early April, which instructed the FDA to lift all age restrictions on Plan B and make it available to everyone on pharmacy shelves. A panel of scientists at the FDA had recommended in 2011 that age restrictions be lifted on the morning-after pill, but Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius overruled that recommendation, arguing that there was a lack of evidence showing that those under the age of 17 would use the pill appropriately. \n \n By dropping the age limit to 15 instead of removing the limit entirely, the FDA has ensured that all women will still have to show an ID to the cashier in order to purchase the emergency contraception. \n \n Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) called the FDA's decision a \"step in the right direction.\" \n \n \"This decision is a step in the right direction for increased access to a product that is a safe and effective method of preventing unintended pregnancies,\" Murray said in a statement. \"It's also a decision that moves us closer to these critical availability decisions being based on science, not politics. Plan B is an essential part of a woman's basic health care and I will continue to push for more information from FDA and HHS on the practical application of this policy while also working to ensure that access is based on science, safety, and efficacy.\" \n \n The Center for Reproductive Rights, which filed the lawsuit against Sebelius and the FDA that led to the judge's ruling in April, said on Tuesday that it is not satisfied with the FDA's decision. \n \n \"The FDA is under a federal court order that makes it crystal clear that emergency contraception must be made available over the counter without restriction to women of all ages by next Monday,\" said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the center. \n \n \"Lowering the age restriction to 15 for over-the-counter access to Plan B One-Step may reduce delays for some young women -- but it does nothing to address the significant barriers that far too many women of all ages will still find if they arrive at the drugstore without identification or after the pharmacy gates have been closed for the night or weekend,\" she added. \n \n \"These are daunting and sometimes insurmountable hoops women are forced to jump through in time-sensitive circumstances, and we will continue our battle in court to remove these arbitrary restrictions on emergency contraception for all women,\" Northup said. \n \n This story has been updated with comments from Sen. Patty Murray and the Center for Reproductive Rights. ||||| FDA NEWS RELEASE \n \n For Immediate Release: April 30, 2013 \n \n Media Inquiries: Erica Jefferson, 301-796-4988, erica.jefferson@fda.hhs.gov \n \n Consumer Inquiries: 888-INFO-FDA \n \n FDA approves Plan B One-Step emergency contraceptive without a prescription for women 15 years of age and older \n \n The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today announced that it has approved an amended application submitted by Teva Women\u2019s Health, Inc. to market Plan B One-Step (active ingredient levonorgestrel) for use without a prescription by women 15 years of age and older. \n \n \n \n After the FDA did not approve Teva\u2019s application to make Plan B One-Step available over-the-counter for all females of reproductive age in December 2011, the company submitted an amended application to make the product available for women 15 years of age and older without a prescription. \n \n \n \n The product will now be labeled \u201cnot for sale to those under 15 years of age *proof of age required* not for sale where age cannot be verified.\u201d Plan B One-Step will be packaged with a product code prompting a cashier to request and verify the customer\u2019s age. A customer who cannot provide age verification will not be able to purchase the product. In addition, Teva has arranged to have a security tag placed on all product cartons to prevent theft. \n \n \n \n In addition, Teva will make the product available in retail outlets with an onsite pharmacy, where it generally, will be available in the family planning or female health aisles. The product will be available for sale during the retailer\u2019s normal operating hours whether the pharmacy is open or not. \n \n \n \n Plan B One-Step is an emergency contraceptive intended to reduce the possibility of pregnancy following unprotected sexual intercourse \u2013 if another form of birth control (e.g., condom) was not used or failed. Plan B One-Step is a single-dose pill (1.5 mg tablet) that is most effective in decreasing the possibility of unwanted pregnancy if taken immediately or within 3 days after unprotected sexual intercourse. \n \n \n \n Plan B One-Step will not stop a pregnancy when a woman is already pregnant, and there is no medical evidence that the product will harm a developing fetus. \n \n \n \n \u201cResearch has shown that access to emergency contraceptive products has the potential to further decrease the rate of unintended pregnancies in the United States,\u201d said FDA Commissioner Margaret A. Hamburg, M.D. \u201cThe data reviewed by the agency demonstrated that women 15 years of age and older were able to understand how Plan B One-Step works, how to use it properly, and that it does not prevent the transmission of a sexually transmitted disease.\u201d \n \n \n \n The approval of Plan B One-Step for use without a prescription by women 15 years of age and older is based on an actual use study and label comprehension data submitted by Teva showing that women age 15 and older understood that the product was not for routine use and would not protect them against sexually-transmitted diseases. These data also established that Plan B One-Step could be used properly within this age group without the intervention of a health care provider. \n \n \n \n Because the product will not protect a woman from HIV or AIDS or other sexually-transmitted diseases, it is important that young women who are sexually active remember to see a health care provider for routine checkups. The health care provider should counsel the patient about, and if necessary test her for, sexually-transmitted diseases, discuss effective methods of routine birth control, and answer any other questions the patient may have. \n \n \n \n Teva has indicated that it plans to educate consumers, pharmacy staff, and health care professionals about the product\u2019s new status. It has also indicated its willingness to conduct an audit of the age verification practices after the product is approved to ensure that the age limitation is being followed. \n \n \n \n On April 5, 2013, a federal judge in New York ordered the FDA to grant a 2001 citizen\u2019s petition to the agency that sought to allow over-the-counter access to Plan B (a two dose levonorgestrel product) for women of all ages and/or make Plan B One-Step available without age or point of sale restrictions. However, Teva\u2019s application to market Plan B One-Step for women 15 and older was pending with the agency prior to the ruling. \n \n \n \n The FDA\u2019s approval of Teva\u2019s current application for Plan B One-Step is independent of that litigation and this decision is not intended to address the judge\u2019s ruling. \n \n \n \n The Department of Justice is considering next steps in the litigation. In the meantime, the FDA took independent action to approve the pending application on Plan B One-Step for use without a prescription by women 15 years of age or older. \n \n \n \n There are currently three emergency contraceptive drugs marketed in the United States \u2013 Plan B One-Step, Plan B, and ella. Plan B, available from generic manufacturers, uses two doses of levonorgestrel (.75 mg in each tablet), taken 12 hours apart, and requires a prescription for women under the age of 17. Ella (ulipristal) is a prescription-only product that prevents pregnancy when taken orally within 120 hours (five days) after a contraceptive failure or unprotected sexual intercourse. The approval of Teva\u2019s application for Plan B One-Step does not affect the prescription status of these other drugs. \n \n \n \n Teva Women\u2019s Health is based in North Wales, Pa. \n \n \n \n The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation\u2019s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products. \n \n # \n \n Read our Blog: FDA Voice \n \n Visit the FDA on Facebook , Flickr , YouTube , and Twitter \n \n RSS Feed for FDA News Releases",

    "document": "(CNN) Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's personal attorney, has been \"under criminal investigation\" for months in New York because of his business dealings, the Justice Department said Friday. \n \n The revelation comes amid a courtroom drama that unfolded Friday, as Cohen's attorneys and Trump's attorneys began a fight hours before with the US Attorney's Office in Manhattan over a massive raid of Cohen's records. \n \n Cohen's attorneys have filed a temporary restraining order in the matter, asking the court to stop federal prosecutors from using some of the records they seized. Cohen did not appear in court Friday morning and has not been charged with a crime. \n \n In response to Cohen's motion to prevent prosecutors from using evidence collected in Monday's raids of his home and office, the US attorney in New York asserted the raids were authorized by a federal judge to seek evidence of conduct \"for which Cohen is under criminal investigation.\" \n \n A court filing did not detail what Cohen is under investigation for. \n \n But the filing contains the first details released by the Justice Department on the searches, which covered Cohen's residence, hotel room, office, safety deposit boxes and two cell phones. Previous search warrants allowed New York federal prosecutors to search multiple email accounts, the filing said. In them, they found that Cohen had done \"little to no legal work, and that zero emails were exchanged with President Trump.\" \n \n The prosecutors assert that they have confidence that any seized material would not fall under the significant amount of attorney-client privilege that Cohen has claimed. They said Cohen has told at least one witness that his only client was Trump. \n \n The prosecutors noted Cohen had personally not turned over any documents to Robert Mueller's Special Counsel investigation. Initially, Mueller had requested some records from Cohen while he was with the Trump family company \u2014 a position he held for about a decade \u2014 yet dropped the request after Cohen pushed back. Mueller's office referred the case about his business dealings to New York but hasn't been involved since, the Manhattan prosecutors said. \n \n Monday's raids included a search for communications related to efforts to suppress negative information ahead of the election, including communications that Trump had with Cohen regarding the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape that captured Trump making lewd remarks about women that surfaced a month before the election, CNN reported this week \n \n It also potentially involved records related to porn star Stormy Daniels, who was paid $130,000 weeks before the election to silence an alleged affair she had with Trump. Records related to Cohen's taxi medallion business were also sought. \n \n Prosecutors say they've set up what's known as a \" taint team \" or \"filter team\" to review Cohen's documents so nothing they seized is used improperly or breaches client confidentiality. \n \n Each search warrant specifically describes how records seized that may fall into attorney-client privilege will be filtered out by a team that's walled off from the federal agents who have conducted the investigation, the prosecutors wrote. \n \n Once they've reviewed the records, the filter team can give to the investigators communications \"between Cohen and persons with whom Cohen undisputedly does not have an attorney-client relationship,\" likely meaning the records wouldn't be between Cohen and Trump, prosecutors said. The filter team is working from a list of individuals and companies they've compiled regarding people who aren't Cohen's legal clients. \n \n Cohen's lawyers, for their part, have asked to review the material for themselves, a proposal which the Manhattan prosecutors are fighting. \n \n The Southern District of New York prosecutors also heard from Trump Organization lawyers, who want them to throw out all communication between Cohen, the company and its employees. \n \n Following the hearing Friday, the judge ordered the parties to return to court Monday for another hearing, where Cohen will have to be present. \n \n Joanna Hendon, a new lawyer for Trump who appeared in court, said her law firm, Spears & Imes LLP, was engaged by Trump on Wednesday and she was \"not prepared\" to present her argument. \n \n The Justice Department is asking for a so-called taint team to vet the material seized in the raids Monday, as is standard process. Cohen's lawyer is asking for the lawyers themselves to review the material or a \"special master\" to decide what is relevant to the case, and Hendon is concerned about a taint team or however the material is handled. \n \n On Monday, Cohen's attorney called the searches \"completely inappropriate and unnecessary.\" \n \n \"It resulted in the unnecessary seizure of protected attorney client communications between a lawyer and his client,\" attorney Stephen Ryan said in the statement. \n \n Michael Avenatti, a lawyer for Stormy Daniels, also made an appearance at the hearing. In a footnote in its filing, the prosecutors expressed doubt that any communications between Trump and Cohen regarding a payoff to Daniels before the election would be covered under attorney-client privilege. They cited the President's own comments. ||||| President Donald Trump's personal attorney Michael Cohen has been under criminal investigation for months, largely centering around his business dealings, federal prosecutors in New York said in court documents obtained by ABC News. \n \n Interested in Donald Trump? Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest \n \n Today, prosecutors acknowledged publicly for the first time Friday that they seized records this week from Cohen. \n \n The revelation came as Cohen and Trump sought a court order barring federal prosecutors from accessing the records they took during raids on his home and office Monday morning. \n \n Lawyers for Cohen and Trump, neither of whom was present in court, argue that at least some of the records are subject to attorney-client privilege and should not be viewed by prosecutors until they, or an independent third party appointed by the court, have a chance to review the material. \n \n Cohen \"applied [Thursday] evening for an opportunity to take the first cut\" at determining whether the documents are privileged or relevant to the investigation, Judge Kimba Wood said. \"Both parties recognize the search of an attorney's devices and offices are subject to special consideration.\" \n \n Jeenah Moon/Reuters \n \n A hearing Friday in Manhattan federal court was put on hold until Monday after an attorney for Trump intervened and requested additional time. \n \n \"He as an acute interest in these proceedings,\" said Joanna Hendon, an attorney for the president who said she was hired Wednesday night. \n \n Hendon noted the \"exceptional nature\" of her client and expressed concern about the prosecutors' internal \"taint team\" that separates evidence that is privileged from evidence that is available for prosecutors to view. \n \n \"We don't need to rush,\" Hendon said. \"There is an appearance of fairness problem.\" \n \n A taint team is a group of people who help determine what falls under attorney-client privilege and should not be shared with investigators. It's standard when searching a lawyer's office. \n \n \u201cThe government\u2019s use of a filter team appropriately protects applicable privileges,\" the court documents obtained by ABC News state. \n \n Monday\u2019s search was broader than previously reported: in addition to Cohen's home and office, there were court-authorized searches of a safety deposit box and two cellphones. \n \n Cohen \u201cis being investigated for criminal conduct that largely centers on his personal business dealings,\u201d according to court documents. \n \n The federal prosecutor\u2019s office \u201chas already obtained search warrants -- covert until this point -- on multiple different email accounts maintained by Cohen, and has conducted a privilege review of the materials obtained pursuant to those warrants,\u201d the court documents state. \n \n That review, prosecutors said, showed that Cohen \"is in fact performing little to no legal work and that zero emails were exchanged with President Trump.\" \n \n Cohen has not been charged with anything. He has not responded to news he is under investigation, declining to comment when contacted by ABC News. \n \n Justin Lane/EPA via Shutterstock \n \n Thomas McKay, one of the prosecutors handling the case, said the president's attorney-client privileges are no different than anyone else's. He accused the president and Cohen of delay tactics but promised prosecutors would not view any of the seized material until the judge makes her ruling following the hearing on Monday. \n \n Also at issue was how much of this dispute will happen in open court. News organizations objected to parts of the hearing -- originally scheduled without notice -- taking place outside of public earshot. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t take this position lightly,\u201d said Wood. \n \n Rachel Strom, an attorney for ABC News, successfully argued to keep most of the hearing open to the public. \n \n \"This is the most important hearing that\u2019s happening today and the public has a right to know how the court is going to handle the search of the president\u2019s lawyer\u2019s documents,\" Strom said.",

Texas Department of Criminal Justice/Handout via REUTERS \n \n The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on Thursday halted the planned June 21 execution of Robert Roberson and sent his case back to a trial court. It based its decision on a recent state law that permits legal challenges citing new scientific evidence potentially pointing to wrongful convictions. \n \n Roberson, 49, was found guilty of killing his daughter in 2002. Prosecutors said he took her to the hospital after causing fatal head injuries or trauma in the toddler. \n \n In a brief filed with the court this month, his lawyers said new scientific evidence showed that he should not have been convicted and the state relied on \u201cfalse, misleading, and scientifically invalid testimony.\u201d \n \n Roberson has contended that the death of the girl, Nikki Curtis, may have been caused by a fall from her bed or a fever of 104.5 degrees Fahrenheit (40.3\u00b0C) that led to a visit to a doctor two days before her death. \n \n Prosecutors presented experts at his original trial who said Nikki died of shaken baby syndrome and that Roberson intended to sexually abuse her. \n \n The Texas attorney general\u2019s office has said in court filings that Roberson was properly convicted and sentenced to death. \n \n For decades, pathologists, pediatricians and courts recognized a distinct set of internal head injuries - brain swelling, bleeding on the surface of the brain and behind the eyes \u2013 as proof of death by deliberate shaking, even in the absence of other overt signs of violence. \n \n But medical consensus has shifted in recent years and research now shows such injuries can be caused by accidental falls from a short height, or even medical conditions such as blood-clotting disorders and latent trauma from a difficult birth, which can manifest weeks later. \n \n Lawyers for Roberson also pointed out that it is impossible to shake a baby to death without causing serious neck injuries, which his child did not suffer. \n \n \u201cRobert Roberson was wrongfully convicted of murdering his ... daughter based on junk science and highly inflammatory sexual-abuse allegations that were false,\u201d his lawyers said in their court filing. ||||| This photo provided by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice shows Robert Roberson III.

(Associated Press) \n \n HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) \u2014 Attorneys who contended \"junk science\" was used to send a father to death row for killing his 2-year-old daughter 14 years ago have won a reprieve blocking the Texas inmate's execution set for next week. \n \n Robert Roberson III, 49, was set to die Tuesday for the February 2002 death of his daughter, Nikki Curtis, at his home in Palestine in East Texas. But the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals sent his case back to his Anderson County trial court late Thursday to review claims he is innocent of capital murder. There is no timetable for the appeal to be resolved. One judge on the nine-member court, Lawrence Meyers, voted to refuse the reprieve and dismiss the appeal. \n \n Lawyers argued Roberson's conviction was based on \"junk science\" and \"false, misleading and scientifically invalid testimony\" and that new scientific evidence establishes he would not have been convicted. \n \n The child had serious head injuries, and Roberson contended she accidentally fell from a bed. Medical staff at a Palestine hospital called police because they considered the injuries suspicious. Physicians who examined her said bruises to her chin, cheek and jaw and a subdural hematoma \u2014 bleeding outside her brain but inside her skull \u2014 likely were intentional and no accident. \n \n Nikki died the next day, Feb. 1, 2002, and a medical examiner ruled blunt force head injuries as the cause. \n \n Defense attorney Benjamin Wolff told the appeals court that Nikki's death could be attributed to a number of things, such as undiagnosed meningitis, an accidental injury before Roberson began caring for her the day she died, a fall from the bed he didn't see or a fatal congenital condition. \n \n The Anderson County District Attorney's office did not immediately respond to a message left Friday. \n \n According to court records, she'd been living with Roberson and his girlfriend, Teddie Cox, for about three months after a court awarded him custody of the child. \n \n Testimony from Cox, who was not the child's mother, showed he had no interest in caring for his daughter, but was her sole caretaker for the first time on Jan. 31, 2002, and was not pleased. \n \n Prosecutors initially said Roberson sexually assaulted the 2-year-old, based on statements from a hospital nurse, but dropped that element of the capital murder charge late in the trial when evidence could not conclusively support it. \n \n \"But by then, the damage had been done,\" Wolff said in Roberson's appeal. \"The state used this rank speculation to drive home its view that Robert was not just a poor, mentally impaired father struggling with sobriety, but a deviant \u2014 capable of raping and brutally shaking his own daughter to death.\" \n \n Roberson was a parolee with previous convictions for burglary and theft and parole violations. \n \n At least seven other Texas inmates have executions scheduled for the coming months, including one in July and four in August. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Michael Graczyk on Twitter at https://twitter.com/mikegraczyk",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A man on death row in Texas has been granted a last-minute reprieve after his lawyers successfully argued he was convicted on \"junk science\" regarding shaken baby syndrome, Reuters reports. Robert Roberson, who had been scheduled to be executed June 21, was convicted in 2002 of murdering his 2-year-old daughter. According to the AP, Roberson's girlfriend says he was angry when he became the sole caregiver of his daughter, Nikki. That same day, Roberson brought Nikki to the hospital with serious head injuries. Doctors thought they looked intentional and called police. Nikki died the following day. While Roberson maintains Nikki was hurt falling off her bed or from a fever, experts during his trial testified that she died of shaken baby syndrome and that Roberson planned to sexually abuse her. But new research shows that what used to be taken as signs of shaken baby syndrome\u2014brain swelling and bleeding behind the eyes and on the brain\u2019s surface\u2014can also be caused by short falls or undiagnosed medical conditions. Roberson's lawyers successfully convinced eight of the nine members on the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals that Roberson had been convicted on \"false, misleading, and scientifically invalid testimony.\" Nikki never showed any outward signs, such as an injured neck, of shaken baby syndrome. Roberson's case will now go back to trial. (This boy died 12 years after being shaken as a baby.)",

He is currently in limbo in a transit area of Moscow's airport as the United States pressures Moscow to expel him home. \n \n \"I want to see the facts established,\" Merkel said on Thursday during a press conference in Berlin. \"I hope to gain information and draw important conclusions.\" \n \n She added: \"I made clear spying on institutions within the European Union is not how we would expect those we consider friends to treat us.

Bush - and down from a previous level of 65 percent. \n \n In a statement, the White House said Obama assured Merkel the United States took the concerns seriously and officials would discuss intelligence and privacy issues as early as July 8. \n \n WITNESS PROTECTION? \n \n Sigmar Gabriel, leader of the SPD, said German authorities should quickly contact Snowden and consider giving him witness protection, German news magazine Spiegel said on Thursday. \n \n Two days earlier, Germany's Foreign and Interior Ministries released a statement saying they had rejected Snowden's request for asylum, faxed to the German embassy in Moscow. \n \n \"The first step must be that the federal prosecutors office travels to Moscow to examine him as a witness,\" Gabriel was quoted as saying, adding if he was reliable Germany should consider whether to put him into a witness protection program. \n \n The White House said Obama and Merkel reiterated their strong support for the launch of Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership negotiations, welcoming the soon-to-begin first round of discussions. \n \n Obama promised on Monday to supply all the information requested by European allies on the allegations, which he said Washington was still evaluating. \n \n \"Every intelligence service, not just ours, but every European intelligence service, every Asian intelligence service, wherever there's an intelligence service, here's one thing they're going to be doing: they're going to be trying to understand the world better and what's going on in world capitals around the world from sources that aren't available through the New York Times or NBC News,\" Obama said. \n \n (Additional reporting by Steve Holland in Washington, Michelle Martin in Berlin; Writing by Alexandra Hudson; Editing by Michael Roddy) ||||| Story highlights European lawmakers approve in-depth inquiry into U.S. surveillance programs \n \n European Union ambassadors meet to discuss allegations of U.S. spying \n \n The meeting comes ahead of talks on a huge American-EU trade deal next week \n \n Ex-NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked details of alleged U.S. spying on allies \n \n Allegations that the United States is spying on its European allies topped the agenda for European Union ambassadors who met Thursday in Brussels, Belgium, as the fallout from claims made by U.S. leaker Edward Snowden widened. \n \n The meeting of the ambassadors to the European Union came ahead of talks due to begin Monday on a huge American-EU free trade deal. \n \n They were expected to discuss the spying allegations as well as revelations about PRISM, the mass U.S. surveillance program, and a proposal to establish an EU-American working group to improve cooperation, EU spokesman Michael Mann said ahead of the meeting. \n \n Allegations that the United States has been conducting surveillance on its European allies have prompted wide concern among European nations. \n \n The issue dominated a conversation Wednesday between President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. \n \n JUST WATCHED Official: NSA spying on EU 'out of control' Replay More Videos ...

    "document": "Rio de Janeiro (AFP) - New regulations aimed at rolling back Brazil's obsession with Cesarean sections took effect Monday, with the government hoping it can steer the country from its status as a world leader in C-section births. \n \n The rules and a campaign called \"Childbirth is normal!\" address what Health Minister Arthur Chioro has dubbed an \"epidemic\" of Cesareans, currently accounting for more than half of births in this nation of 200 million. \n \n About 84 percent of Brazilian mothers on private health care undergo the operation, in which the baby is delivered through a small incision in the mother's abdomen -- often for no other reason than the convenience of being able to choose the date. \n \n In public hospitals, that figure is approximately 40 percent. \n \n This still tops the 32 percent rate in the United States and is massively higher than World Health Organisation recommendations of 10 to 15 percent. \n \n Brazil's new rules require doctors and hospitals to share information with patients, notably the number of Cesareans they have already carried out. \n \n When they fail to give requested information, the health insurance companies face fines of up to about $8,000. \n \n Making patients better informed will help diminish the rush for C-sections, health officials say. \n \n \"Childbirth is one of the most important moments in the life of a woman and her family,\" said Jose Carlos de Souza Abrahao, director of ANS, a specialized health ministry agency. \n \n \"By informing her of the risks that could come with an unnecessary surgical procedure, she will be more sure in her decision regarding the delivery, choosing what's best for her health and for her baby's health.\" \n \n - Mothers mean money - \n \n Mass Cesareans are Brazil's \"international shame,\" pediatrician Luciana Herrero told AFP. \n \n Ignorance and desire for convenience drive Brazilian mothers-to-be to the operating table, said the author of the just published book \"Diario de Bordo do Parto,\" or \"Guide to Childbirth.\" \n \n But Herrero echoed many in Brazil, saying that \"encouragement\" by doctors and hospitals is also to blame. \n \n Even when fees for a Cesarean and normal birth don't vary, the surgical option is still more profitable for hospitals because it can be scheduled to the minute and has little of the unpredictability -- and possibly long working hours -- of natural labor. \n \n Rosana Clein, a 37-year-old marketing manager in Rio, wanted to have her son naturally three months ago. At the last minute, due to pain, she had Tom delivered by Cesarean. \n \n Even well before, though, when she was insisting on keeping things natural, she felt pressured. \n \n \"I tried to find a doctor who was supposed to do a natural birth like this, but in Brazil it's not so easy. They try to convince you the best way is to do a Cesarean. They say you're going to have a lot of pain the natural way,\" she told AFP. \n \n \"For the doctor, it's really easier to have the Cesarean. You can book it and you have your agenda. It's not a question of saying, 'Go to the hospital now in the middle of the night.'\" \n \n - Changing the culture - \n \n Cesareans may be convenient but they can also be dangerous for the mother and potentially pose grave future health consequences for the baby, ranging from an increased risk of obesity to chronic illness. \n \n Herrero applauded government attempts to make women better informed. \n \n \"Knowledge is power,\" she said. \n \n \"Seven out of 10 Brazilian women begin their pregnancy intending to have a normal delivery, but barely half of them do so. \n \n \"I wonder how many of these women changed their mind during their pregnancy, how many had a real medical reason justifying surgery, and how many were persuaded unnecessarily to have the Cesarean?\" \n \n But the latest government effort is still insufficient. \n \n \"I believe the solution must include other sectors of society and be discussed openly with all involved... so that together we can put births in Brazil onto a new path,\" said Herrero. \n \n Clein said that after speaking with many other expectant and new mothers over the last year, she feels change is already happening. \n \n \"There are a lot of women trying now to have the natural way. They're talking a lot about it, that it's good for the baby, just in the same way that they say breastfeeding is good for the baby.\" ||||| C-Sections Deliver Cachet For Wealthy Brazilian Women \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Felipe Dana/AP Felipe Dana/AP \n \n The office is immaculate, as you would expect in an upscale neighborhood in Sao Paulo \u2014 all sterile, white, modish plastic furniture and green plants. Behind the reception desk are pictures that would look more appropriate in a pop art gallery than a private maternity clinic. \n \n The list of services at the clinic in Brazil's largest city is long: fertility treatments, specialized gynecology and, of course, obstetrics. But one thing they rarely do here is preside over a vaginal delivery. \n \n Dr. Alexandre Sasaoka struggles to remember the last time he assisted at one. We do them, he says, but rarely. \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Felipe Dana/AP Felipe Dana/AP \n \n And he's not alone. \n \n Brazil has one of the world's highest rates of cesarean deliveries: Some 80 to 90 percent of women in private hospitals in the country give birth via cesarean section. In some hospitals that number climbs to 99 percent. \n \n Much Higher Than The U.S. \n \n That contrasts with 30 percent of women in the United States and 1 in 4 women in Britain. \n \n And even that is high: The World Health Organization says more than 15 percent of women giving birth by C-section is too many. It cites increased medical costs and neonatal complications as potential problems. \n \n But Brazil's economic boom of the past decade has dragged some 40 million people into the middle class. The emphasis on status begins at birth \u2014 and cesarean deliveries are the Louis Vuitton of the maternity world. \n \n Women in Brazil want C-sections, says Sasaoka. They like them because they prefer being able to schedule their delivery and better organize their busy lives. \n \n Sasaoka says he also recommends them. \n \n He says he doesn't think they are necessarily better, but that a woman needs to consider more than just the medical aspect of birth, such as the impact on her and her family. \n \n Of course, he says, there are many advantages to a natural birth; C-sections are a major surgery, after all. But he says women ask for C-sections, and they also allow doctors to be better organized. \n \n For example, he says, doctors don't have to interrupt what they are doing with other patients to assist a natural birth. \n \n Pressure From Doctors \n \n \n \n There is a debate in Brazil as to why the rate here is so high. Doctors like Sasaoka say it's due to the demand. \n \n But new mother Mariana \u2014 who doesn't want her last name used for fear of offending her doctor \u2014 says often women feel bullied into it. \n \n She says she wanted to have a vaginal delivery. \n \n \"My doctor said to me he'd have more control in a C-section than in a natural birth,\" she says. \n \n He also told her he would also almost certainly have to do an episiotomy \u2014 a procedure where the vaginal opening gets cut to allow for delivery. She was terrified. She says her doctor kept telling her that C-sections were better, and that she felt pressure to have one. \n \n Still, Mariana decided to try to give birth naturally. Then two weeks before her due date, her blood pressure spiked. And her doctor said she needed to have a C-section after all. The next day she was in the operating room. \n \n To this day she wonders if it was really necessary. She says that's the legacy of all the intervention here. \n \n \"I don't know. I think he was right,\" she says. \"But the problem in Brazil is we lack the trust between doctor and patient.\" \n \n Brazil has a two-tiered medical system. The C-section rate in public hospitals is much lower, the result of a government push to reduce medical costs associated with C-sections. \n \n But in private hospitals, cesarean deliveries are seen as status symbols. \n \n And that, say natural childbirth advocates, has to change. \n \n While doulas \u2014 or birth coaches \u2014 are a regular presence in many maternity wards these days in the U.S., they are still uncommon in Brazil. \n \n But they are the first port of call for couples looking to have a natural birth. \n \n Doula Mariana de Mesquita talks to a couple who say they are having trouble finding a doctor who is willing to deliver their baby vaginally. \n \n She says her profession basically disappeared with the rise of C-sections. And she says one of the most important roles she has these days is education. \n \n \"Most women don't even know how long labor can last, the basics,\" de Mesquita says. \"So I teach them what a normal birth is like, what they can expect.\" \n \n Sign Of Liberation Or Submissiveness? \n \n Brazil essentially copied the North American obstetric model, which is very interventionist, she says. \n \n De Mesquita adds that doctors do get paid more for C-sections, which is another reason for their prevalence. \n \n But she also blames women here. \n \n She says Brazilian women aren't afraid of surgery. There is a lot of plastic surgery, for example. \n \n \"Women put themselves at risk for very little,\" de Mesquita says. \n \n She says people in Brazil see C-sections as a sign of women's liberation, but she sees them as \"a sign of their submissiveness to a violent medical system.\" \n \n That's nonsense, says 29-year-old Pamela Bassy. She works at a store in an upscale mall, and she's expecting a son in a few months. \n \n With a cesarean, she says, she can take full advantage of her maternity leave, working right up to the day before she gives birth. \n \n \"My family and my husband wanted me to have a vaginal birth,\" she adds. \"But in the end, it's my choice.\" ||||| Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The caesarean rate in Brazil is more than 50% \n \n New rules have come into force in Brazil aimed at reducing the country's high number of caesarean births. \n \n Eighty-five per cent of all births in Brazilian private hospitals are caesareans and in public hospitals the figure is 45%. \n \n The new rules oblige doctors to inform women about the risks and ask them to sign a consent form before performing a caesarean. \n \n Doctors will also have to justify why a caesarean was necessary. \n \n They will have to fill in a complete record of how the labour and birth developed and explain their actions. \n \n Each pregnant woman will now be assigned medical notes which record the history of her pregnancy, which she can take with her if she changes doctors. \n \n The new rules are designed to reduce unnecessary surgical procedures, and ensure pregnant women are aware of the risks associated with caesareans. \n \n However, experts say that a scarcity of maternity beds and wards equipped to deal with natural births means that for many women in Brazil, caesarean birth is seen as the best option. \n \n \"The best way to guarantee yourself a bed in a good hospital is to book a caesarean,\" Pedro Octavio de Britto Pereira, an obstetrician and professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, said in an interview with BBC Brasil last year. \n \n 'Uncivilised and primitive' \n \n Women who want to give birth naturally in a private hospital have reported finding all the beds are reserved for scheduled deliveries. \n \n There have been numerous reports of women going into labour without a caesarean scheduled and being forced to travel from hospital to hospital in search of a bed. \n \n Researchers say many women also see caesareans as more civilised and modern, and natural birth as primitive, ugly and inconvenient. \n \n In Brazil's body-conscious culture, where there is little information given about childbirth, there is also huge concern that natural birth can make women sexually unattractive. \n \n Many doctors prefer caesareans too, as they can plan the time of a birth, and feel more protected from litigation. \n \n Gynaecologist Renato Sa told BBC Brasil: \"Doctors are responsible for what happens and in a situation of risk they chose a caesarean, because if there is a death or complication they will be asked why they didn't do this. Doctors are afraid of natural childbirth.\" ||||| Identifying barriers and facilitators towards implementing guidelines to reduce caesarean section rates in Quebec \n \n Nils Chaillet a, Eric Dub\u00e9 b, Maryl\u00e8ne Dugas a, Diane Francoeur c, Johanne Dub\u00e9 d, Sonia Gagnon e, Lucie Poitras f, Alexandre Dumont a \n \n Background \n \n The World Health Organization recommends that the caesarean section rate should not be higher than 10% to 15%.1 The caesarean delivery rate in Canada increased steadily from 17.5% of deliveries in 1994\u20131995 to 23.7% in 2002\u20132003.2,3 Moreover, caesarean delivery was associated with high maternal and neonatal complication rates and increased health-care costs.4\u20139 \n \n According to the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC), vaginal delivery represents the safest route for the fetus and newborn in the first and subsequent pregnancies.10 SOGC clinical practices guidelines contribute to the promotion of evidence-based practice and represent an appropriate means for reducing caesarean section rates in Canada. The challenge lies in implementing these guidelines.11\u201315 Each clinical environment presents organizational, professional, maternal and cultural particularities. The identification of specific barriers and facilitators represents a new approach for identifying the determinants of guidelines use by health professionals.7,15\u201318 \n \n This study\u2019s premise is that strategies to implement guidelines and reduce caesarean section rates should take into account physicians\u2019 perceptions in order to identify different forces and variables influencing their behaviour. Consequently, we carried out an exploratory study to investigate obstetricians\u2019 perceptions of SOGC guidelines, and to identify barriers to, facilitators of and obstetricians\u2019 solutions for their implementation. \n \n Methods \n \n We used a qualitative study design to explore and describe obstetricians\u2019 perceptions in three Montreal hospitals (one primary-level, one secondary-level and one tertiary-level),19 with annual deliveries \u2265 1000, caesarean section rates \u2265 20%, and where 75% of obstetricians agreed to participate. Data was obtained from two focus group sessions, with obstetricians from each of the three hospitals, dealing with induction of labour at term and fetal health surveillance in labour guidelines, and operative vaginal birth and vaginal birth after previous caesarean birth guidelines. For secondary-level and tertiary-level hospitals, with more than 10 clinicians, focus groups were divided into two sessions; thus there were four focus groups in each hospital. All obstetricians were approached to participate in the study. \n \n Data sources and collection \n \n A focus group gathers people from similar backgrounds or experiences to discuss a specific topic of interest.19 Focus groups conducted at each unit were scheduled at the convenience of participants. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with clinicians who were not able to take part in the focus groups. The focus groups and personal interviews lasted approximately 90 minutes. A moderator, also referred to as an interviewer, conducted each focus group in the presence of an observer, but only the moderator conducted the semi-structured interviews. The moderator was in control of the session and was responsible for the direction taken by the focus group. The main tasks of the observer were to take notes, including non-verbal observations, to record and observe the session. All focus groups and interviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim. The interviewer and observer reconstructed detailed notes of each interview immediately after the session. An interview guide was used for all focus groups and interviews (Annex 1, available at http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/10/06-039289/en/index.html). \n \n Focus groups and interviews about SOGC guidelines were structured in the following manner: respondents were asked to describe their perceptions about the adoption of recommendations, barriers and challenges encountered when following the recommendations, and factors and interventions they believed important for facilitating and supporting use of the recommendations. \n \n Guidelines recommendations \n \n This study focused on four SOGC evidence-based guidelines (available at: http://www.sogc.org) for improving best practice in obstetric care:20\u201324 induction of labour at term, fetal health surveillance in labour, guidelines for operative vaginal birth and guidelines for vaginal birth after previous caesarean birth (Annex 1). \n \n Data analysis \n \n Analysis of transcripts was planned according to Graham 2004.18 The tapes were transcribed, and their accuracy was verified. Analysing the data from one hospital at a time, two researchers (NC, ED) jointly coded and categorized ideas into broader themes through consensus until all the transcripts were reviewed. To ensure study rigor and reduce limitations, we used the logbook method in A manual for the use of focus groups to help analyse transcripts;19 this consists of a table used to record answers on selected topics. Focus groups and semi-directed interviews were separately analysed. Once all transcripts were analysed, results were reviewed to describe findings that apply to the study as a whole. As hypotheses were generated, we sought confirmation by returning to the transcripts to find evidence to refute or support these. One obstetrician (AD) on the research team reviewed the analysis to ensure the accuracy of our interpretations and critical analysis during the entire process. \n \n Findings \n \n Ten focus groups divided into two sessions (Annex 1) and six semi-structured interviews were conducted in the three hospitals. On the 33 available obstetricians, 27 (80%) agreed to participate, ensuring that the sample is highly representative (Table 1). \n \n Interviewed obstetricians noted that the clinical practice guidelines were generally easy to understand and that they preserve obstetricians\u2019 discretion to judge appropriate treatment. Moreover, the guidelines are perceived as evidence-based and as a legal reference. However, obstetricians identified specific barriers to and facilitating factors for implementing the guidelines\u2019 recommendations in practice (Tables 2 and 3). Obstetricians also said the focus group sessions acted as strong facilitating factors, and that these should constitute the first step for improving the use of recommendations in practice. \n \n Induction of labour at term \n \n Obstetricians said the augmentation of induction of labour before 41 complete gestation weeks, mainly explained by the increase in maternal requests and the unavailability of induction during the weekend, is an important barrier to change. Induction at term, especially with unfavourable cervix (i.e. Bishop Score < 6),=\"\" may=\"\" increase=\"\" the=\"\" risk=\"\" of=\"\" failure=\"\" to=\"\" progress=\"\" and=\"\" the=\"\" need=\"\" for=\"\" a=\"\" caesarean=\"\">20 \n \n According to obstetricians, the augmentation of maternal request for induction at term was explained by maternal insecurity or logistic factors (end of maternity leave) because of insufficient information about the delay between estimated and real birth dates. Consequently, providing the latest expected birth date to women instead of the mean expected birth date has been perceived as a potential facilitator to reduce induction on maternal request. Moreover, obstetricians said that when they were planning an induction, explanations about the method to be used, side-effects, risks of caesarean section and possible complications were insufficiently discussed with the woman. \n \n Medico-legal concerns also encouraged induction for convenience and the rise of induction of labour before 41 complete gestation weeks. Indeed, a general proactive approach was seen by obstetricians as a means to reduce potential risk of lawsuits. The unavailability of induction during the weekend has also been perceived as an important barrier to change, increasing the risk of induction failure because women may be induced two days before the expected date. This may lead to an interruption of labour, then to a caesarean section. The adoption of a departmental policy in hospital B promoting the standardization of induction at term positively influenced the use of recommendations. Staff meetings, formal protocols for induction at term and standardized information to women contributed to enhance the adoption of the recommendations and to reduce induction at maternal request. \n \n Fetal health surveillance in labour \n \n Obstetricians noted a slow uptake of intermittent auscultation in the delivery unit. There is some evidence that the use of continuous electronic fetal monitoring may lead to increased false positives for fetal hypoxemia and to resulting caesarean sections.21,22 \n \n Human resources and organizational factors have been seen as the main barriers to performing intermittent auscultation, as a one-to-one nurse\u2013patient ratio is uncommon in the three hospitals. Moreover, obstetricians noted that the use of continuous electronic fetal monitoring and the presence of a unit\u2019s central monitoring system may permit a nurse to attend to several women simultaneously. However, it could have negative effects on the progress of labour because of the lack of psychological support to the mother.28 Another identified barrier was that some anaesthesiologists prefer the use of continuous electronic fetal monitoring when women receive an epidural. Obstetricians also noted that unavailability of equipment was an important barrier to accurately diagnosing fetal hypoxemia. The absence of a pH meter at hospital B was identified as a practical impediment to an optimal use of recommendations because obstetricians cannot use fetal scalp blood sampling to investigate non-reassuring patterns of the electronic fetal monitoring. Moreover, when a pH meter was available, the use of fetal scalp blood sampling might be limited because of technical limitations, including the skill level of operators, anatomical difficulties associated with the procedure and associated pain experienced by the woman. \n \n Fear of lawsuits was also suggested as a factor that limits the use of intermittent auscultation. Obstetricians described continuous electronic fetal monitoring as reassuring because this method is based on objective criteria, and an electronic fetal monitoring paper strip represents a strong evidence of good practice in case of lawsuits. Obstetricians also noted that continuous electronic fetal monitoring helps to supervise students and residents in the delivery unit. However, some obstetricians thought that medico-legal concerns may also encourage the use of intermittent auscultation because interpretation of the strip is difficult and variable. For them, the use of intermittent auscultation as described in the guidelines represents the best practice and the optimal way to avoid the charges of malpractice. \n \n Obstetricians commented that the growing number of less experienced junior nurses, especially during the night, has also slowed the adoption of the recommendations because they seem more comfortable using continuous electronic fetal monitoring. In contrast, senior nurses seem more comfortable with the use of intermittent auscultation, because of their experience, and this may influence their colleagues to adopt the recommendations. Equally, obstetricians stated that senior obstetricians may have stronger influence than junior obstetricians in promoting the adoption of intermittent auscultation. Finally, obstetricians noted that strong nursing and obstetric leadership is an important facilitator for encouraging the adoption of guidelines. \n \n Moreover, maternal preference to have continuous electronic fetal monitoring has been perceived as a potential barrier to the adoption of recommendations. Obstetricians thought that the women may be reassured by continuous electronic fetal monitoring, especially when they receive weak labour support. \n \n Operative vaginal birth \n \n Obstetricians noted a weak adoption of operative vaginal birth recommendations, especially for breech presentation and the use of forceps. \n \n Conclusions of the term breech trial of Hannah et al.25 stating that planned caesarean sections are seen as a means to reduce potential risks of morbidity and lawsuits also affected adoption of the recommendations. Obstetricians indicated that they await more evidence about maternal and neonatal morbidity before fully adopting the guidelines. Not having a blended payment method also has been perceived as an economic incentive to recommend caesarean sections, because they are easier to schedule than vaginal deliveries and generate additional income. \n \n Obstetricians also noted that the use of mid forceps may not be compatible with their philosophy because of their personal experiences or convictions. Another identified barrier to using forceps was the loss of skills or unwillingness to offer instrumental vaginal birth. Indeed, some resident obstetricians and junior obstetricians may experience stress at the prospect of using mid forceps or manual rotations because of their lack of experience and their concerns about legal consequences. However, the possibility of referring a patient to a more experienced colleague has been identified as a potential facilitator to improve the use of these recommendations. \n \n Maternal refusal to attempt an external cephalic version was also seen as a potential barrier to reduce caesarean section rate for breech presentation. Obstetricians said explanations about the risks and benefits of external cephalic version versus a planned caesarean section were insufficiently discussed with women. \n \n Vaginal birth after caesarean \n \n The need of complex infrastructures necessary to offer a safe vaginal birth after previous caesarean birth was perceived as an important barrier to change. Obstetricians noted that the recommendations cannot be adopted everywhere, especially when many hospitals do not have an available anaesthetist on call around the clock. Moreover, the guideline recommends that \u201ca trial of labour should be offered to a woman with one previous transverse low-segment caesarean section\u201d.24 The use of conditional verb tense in the guideline has been identified as a potential barrier to adopting the recommendations, refusing any sort of obligation. \n \n Fear of lawsuits and concerns about the legal consequences of uterine rupture have been perceived as important barriers to adopting the recommendations because obstetricians are more sensitive to maternal and fetal health during trial of labour, and privilege the faster decision of caesarean section. Obstetricians commented that they wanted more evidence about the benefits of a trial of labour compared to a planned caesarean section, and that they need an accurate method for predicting uterine rupture to fully adopt the recommendations. \n \n Obstetricians also said that informing the women about the risks and benefits of trial of labour versus planned caesarean section is time-consuming, and may have a low effect on the final decision, particularly when the women request a repeat caesarean section. Women who had undergone a previous caesarean section without complication may ask for a new caesarean section, and reject the offer of trial of labour. Fear of uterine rupture and newborn morbidity, fear of childbirth, fear of emergency caesarean section or pain during labour, and potential request for additional surgery were perceived as factors contributing to maternal rejection of a trial of labour. \n \n However, the possibility of requesting a second opinion was suggested to be a strong facilitator for encouraging women to attempt a trial of labour (adopted in hospital A) by providing personalized explanations about risks and benefits, and creating a supportive climate for influencing women to choose the safest mode of delivery. However, obstetricians at hospital C suggested that a second opinion should only be obtained between a family practitioner and an obstetrician because of the difficulties in identifying the medico-legal responsibilities between two obstetricians. Moreover, the difficulty in providing a second opinion for women who have already decided to have a planned caesarean section has also been seen as a potential barrier to influencing women\u2019s choices. \n \n Implementation interventions \n \n In each hospital, obstetricians seek to improve quality of care. However, medical culture and local environment can modify the nature of the improvement adopted by health professionals.16,26 Obstetricians suggested several strategies for improving the use of guidelines and enhancing their practice. In each hospital, health professionals\u2019 education was identified as an important factor in improvement. Obstetricians suggested that educational workshops focusing on the recommendations in practice would make the guidelines more acceptable and useful to health professionals. In addition, promoting women\u2019s education about the risks and benefits of vaginal delivery compared to caesarean section, with informational materials available in waiting rooms, was perceived as an efficient strategy for sensitizing women and enhancing communication between health professionals and women. Finally, peer review activity (audit and feedback) championed by opinion leaders has been identified as the most important contributor to improve the use of recommendations. Obstetricians recognized that guidelines represent national or international evidence; this sensitized them to change their own practices. However, obstetricians also said that they need more local evidence to effectively change their practices, because they wanted to validate the transferability of the guidelines in their own practices. The local evidence generated by the audit and feedback process, representing a systematic review of local care against explicit criteria,15 was perceived as a strong key factor to assess the transferability and the adoption of the recommendations. Moreover, the identification of opinion leaders, defined as change agents who have significant social influence,27 was seen as a strong facilitator to support the guidelines and to improve the acceptance of the audit and feedback process. Equally, it has been suggested that involving key members of the hospital administration in the feedback activities of the audit process could facilitate potential institutional changes at the level of the hospital. \n \n Transferability of the findings \n \n The findings of this study may not be transferable to all hospital settings. However, the inclusion of hospitals offering different levels of care, representing around 10% of the births in Quebec province, should increase the validity of the findings. Moreover, a qualitative study in Ontario also explored barriers and facilitators influencing the use of intermittent auscultation among nurses identified findings similar to those obtained in this study.28 In addition, a systematic review to maintain high-quality performance of health workers in low- and middle-income countries suggested that audit with feedback in a multifaceted intervention was effective in improving the use of recommendations.29 Likewise, qualitative methods for describing contextual factors and barriers to change have also been identified as a key factor in low- and middle-income countries adopting guidelines. The results of these studies are consistent with those presented in this paper and support the validity of this methodology and the transferability of the findings in Canada and in low- and middle-income countries. \n \n Study limitations \n \n The nature of the focus group increases the possibility that the respondents may have been influenced by a member with a high social influence. To limit this bias, all focus group sessions were validated considering non-verbal observations, and no major influence was identified. Data was also jointly coded and classified by categories by two researchers to limit potential bias and inappropriate interpretation of transcripts. Moreover, throughout the analytical process the findings were discussed with the research team, including obstetricians, to improve the critical analysis and to ensure the accuracy of the interpretations. Finally, obstetricians said women\u2019s motivations are an important factor in effectively adopting the recommendations. However, a qualitative study should be conducted with women to ensure the validity of this finding. \n \n Conclusion \n \n Identified barriers to and facilitators for the implementation of the SOGC guidelines can be classified into four categories: 1) the hospital level, including management and hospital policies; 2) the departmental level, including local policies, leadership, organizational factors, economic incentives and availability of equipment and staff; 3) the health professionals\u2019 motivations and attitudes, including medico-legal concerns, skill levels, acceptance of guidelines and strategies used to implement recommendations; and 4) women\u2019s motivations, including the nature of medical explanations provided, and the management of maternal request for medical interventions. \n \n Implementing the use of recommendations is a complex process influenced by multiple factors. Identifying the potential barriers to and facilitators for the adoption of recommendations is an important approach for guiding the development of efficient strategies to improve local acceptance of guidelines. The findings of this study suggest that the implementation of guidelines may be improved if local health professionals\u2019 perceptions are considered in order to make recommendations more acceptable and useful. Our findings also support the assumption that obstetricians seek to implement best practices but that they require evidence, tools and support to assess their practices and enhance their performance. In addition, peer review activities championed by opinion leaders have been recommended by obstetricians for improving the use of the guidelines in their practices. \u25a0 \n \n Ethical approval \n \n This study was approved by the ethics committees of the three hospitals. \n \n References \n \n Affiliations",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 In 2013, 32.7% of all babies delivered in America were born by cesarean section. If that sounds high, well, check out Brazil's stats. The BBC reports that at private hospitals, 85% of women deliver by cesarean; in public hospitals, it's about half that (45%). In 2013 NPR reported the figure for some private hospitals is 99%; one doctor NPR spoke with could hardly recall the last time he handled a vaginal delivery. The World Health Organization recommends a 10% to 15% rate. In an effort to get closer to that figure, Brazil is now making it a little more, well, laborious to have a cesarean. New rules were introduced yesterday, reports AFP, and going forward, there's more paperwork. After women are told about the risks (now required), they'll have to sign a consent form; a doctor will have to fill out a form that asks for the justification of the procedure. But forms may not solve what some women say is the real issue: a lack of beds. Those who want to deliver in a private hospital report that the beds are often completely preassigned to women who've booked a cesarean, forcing them to, in some instances, go to hospital after hospital while in labor. AFP reports doctors play a role, too, with some saying doctors encourage women to take the scheduled route, which helps quash middle-of-the-night working hours. As one pediatrician puts it, mass cesareans are the country's \"international shame.\"",

The company inked a deal with an investor group led by former Obama administration official Maria Contreras-Sweet, but the group terminated its offer earlier this month after seeing that the company had more liabilities than previously disclosed. \n \n Weinstein Co said in a statement it entered into a \u201cstalking horse\u201d agreement with a Lantern Capital affiliate, that would purchase substantially all of the assets of the company. \n \n The offer from Lantern will set the floor for higher and better bidders in a court-supervised auction. \n \n Lions Gate Entertainment Corp had made an earlier offer for some of the company\u2019s assets, as had Qatar-owned film company Miramax, which was founded by Harvey Weinstein and his brother Bob Weinstein. Both could be among potential bidders in the auction. \n \n Harvey Weinstein: NYPD on verge of arrest in rape investigation Read more \n \n More than 70 women accused the company\u2019s co-founder, Harvey Weinstein, who was one of Hollywood\u2019s most influential men, of sexual misconduct, including rape.

The announcement of the filing marks the latest turn in a stunning fall for the prestigious indie studio responsible for many award-winning films, but now embroiled in a transformative controversy thanks to several dozen women who have come forward in recent months to publicly accuse Harvey Weinstein of rampant sexual misconduct. \n \n The bankruptcy petition in Delaware will position Lantern Asset Management as the stalking horse bidder for Weinstein Co. assets after coming to a purchase agreement. Other companies will be able to bid at an auction after a bankruptcy judge reviews the bidding procedure and any objections. \n \n \u201cWhile we had hoped to reach a sale out of court, the Board is pleased to have a plan for maximizing the value of its assets, preserving as many jobs as possible and pursuing justice for any victims,\u201d chairman Bob Weinstein said Monday in a statement. \n \n Texas-based Lantern was previously part of the Ron Burkle-Maria Contreras-Sweet bid to buy the company that was scuttled last month. \n \n \u201cWe are honored to be selected as the bidder to acquire the company\u2019s businesses as an ongoing concern,\" stated Lantern co-founders Andy Mitchell and Milos Brajovic. \"In the last several months, Lantern has evaluated the company and is proud to provide a solution to the board.\u201d \n \n Since bombshell news reports in October first detailed how Harvey Weinstein abused his power by luring women under the guise of career opportunity and allegedly assaulting many of them, TWC has attempted to survive in the midst of a growing #MeToo movement. On Oct. 8, Weinstein was fired from the studio he co-founded with brother Bob. But that hasn't been enough to save the company from facing tough questions over whether its board members facilitated unlawful behavior. \n \n The bankruptcy filing for the producer of such films as Silver Linings Playbook, Django Unchained and Lion and television fare including Project Runway comes after TWC pursued a sale outside of the bankruptcy process to save the jobs of some 150 individuals and salvage some of its reputation. After seeking bridge loans from private equity firms, TWC closed in on a transaction with an investor group led by Maria Contreras-Sweet promising a female-run studio that wouldn't simply sell off the company's nearly 300-film library. \n \n But the deal was scuttled when New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman brought a wide-ranging lawsuit alleging violations of civil rights, human rights and business laws. The complaint in New York state court alleges complicity by Harvey Weinstein's business partners and demands financial penalties and restitution for victims. TWC then attempted to salvage the deal by firing its chief operating officer, David Glasser, but couldn't come to an agreement to satisfy everyone. \n \n A Chapter 11 filing provides immediate relief in the form of pausing pending civil matters, including Schneiderman's lawsuit and also the handful of other cases now being pursued by others. To pay off substantial debts, TWC will now look towards an auction. Bidders could be comforted by the idea that assets may be sold free and clear of claims and encumbrances \u2014 while those suing the company will be regarded as unsecured creditors. The prospect was enough that in advance of the bankruptcy, Schneiderman's office urged TWC management to release employees from non-disclosure agreements. In an announcement, TWC said it will indeed release Harvey Weinstein's victims from confidentiality obligations. According to a spokesperson, \"No one should be afraid to speak out or coerced to stay quiet.\" \n \n According to the filing, TWC has between 200-999 creditors and $500 million to $1 billion in assets and estimated liabilities. Among its top creditors with the 30 largest unsecured claimes are Wanda Pictures ($14.4M), Viacom ($5.6M) and Sony ($3.7M). Attorneys from top law firms including Boies, Schiller & Flexner, O'Melveny & Myers and Greenberg Glusker are also owed millions. \n \n Robert Del Genio and Luke Schaeffer are appointed Chief Restructuring Officer and Chief Strategy Officer, respectively. \n \n The bankruptcy won't mean an end to troubles for Weinstein and those on the company's board. \n \n Creditors including those in the entertainment industry who are owed residual payments plus female accusers and investors will likely push a broad investigation into Weinstein's conduct and any dishonesty and incompetence that contributed to the debtor's downfall. If the court authorizes a trustee, this individual could seek to initiate an adversary proceeding to pin liability on the Weinsteins and recover money for the benefit of the debtors' estate. Meanwhile, Harvey Weinstein himself is currently involved in an arbitration over his firing and, as a stakeholder, he could pursue his own claims during the course of the bankruptcy. \n \n Of course, with the possibility of criminal cases to be pursued against Weinstein, other events could overtake bankruptcy in the priority line. As of today, though, law enforcement authorities haven't filed charges despite active investigations and referrals.",

Former Agriculture Minister Hwang Min was purged over a proposed project seen as a direct challenge to Kim\u2019s leadership, it said. \n \n If true, it would mark the first executions ordered by Kim from outside his party or the military, the paper said. A spokesman at South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry said he couldn\u2019t immediately confirm the JoongAng report. \n \n Kim has carried out a series of executions since taking power in 2011 after his father\u2019s death as he puts his mark on the leadership of the isolated nuclear-armed nation. The most high profile was the killing three years ago of his uncle and one-time deputy Jang Song Thaek. He had about 50 officials executed in 2014 on charges ranging from graft to watching South Korean soap operas. \n \n \"Kim is continuing to replace the old guard of his father\u2019s regime with loyalists,\" said Robert Kelly, a political science professor at South Korea\u2019s Pusan National University. \"The charges are obviously trumped up, and this is how promotion or demotion often works in totalitarian states without legitimate venues for opposition.\" \n \n Uncle Purged \n \n Kim had his military chief Ri Yong Gil executed in February on charges including corruption, Yonhap News reported at the time. In January last year he executed General Pyon In Son, head of operations in the army, for disagreeing with him; and in May of that year he purged his defense minister Hyon Yong Chol for dozing off at a rally. \n \n For an explainer on North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, click here. \n \n Still, reports of purges of senior North Korean officials are not uncommon and at times have proven to be unreliable. \n \n Earlier this month, Seoul announced that a senior North Korean diplomat based in the U.K. had defected to South Korea. The man was among seven diplomats who have defected this year, according to JoongAng Ilbo. \n \n Fractured Regime? \n \n South Korean President Park Geun Hye said on Monday the defections signal a \u201cserious fracture\u201d within the North Korean regime and raise the prospects of fresh provocations as Kim seeks to maintain control. Her comments came as South Korea and the U.S. hold annual military drills that North Korea calls a prelude to an invasion. \n \n Even so, Kelly at Pusan University said that the isolated state is probably more stable than many people think or want it to be. \n \n \"I don\u2019t think there has been a fracture,\" he said. \"So long as China keeps the goodies flowing into Pyongyang, which is like a city-state in an ocean of deprivation, the elites won\u2019t turn on each other.\" ||||| Two senior regime officers reported to have been killed for posing a threat to leader Kim Jong-un \n \n North Korea\u2019s purge of senior officials who are deemed a threat to Kim Jong-un\u2019s leadership of the country has continued with the public executions of two senior officials, according to South Korean media, possibly to generate fear among members of the elite after recent high-level defections. \n \n \n \n The conservative daily, the JoongAng Ilbo, reported on Tuesday that Hwang Min, a former agriculture minister, and Ri Yong-jin, a senior official at the education ministry, were executed by anti-aircraft gun at a military academy in Pyongyang earlier this month. \n \n Hwang was reportedly killed for making policy proposals that were seen as a direct threat to Kim\u2019s leadership. The report did not give details of the proposals. Ri was said to have been executed for falling asleep during a meeting chaired by Kim. \n \n The newspaper\u2019s front-page report, based on information from an unnamed source it claimed had \u201cspecial knowledge\u201d of the regime, has not been independently verified. No announcement has been made by the state\u2019s official KCNA news agency. \n \n The rumoured executions, though, would fit into a pattern of purges Kim has ordered against perceived enemies since he became leader in late 2011 after the death of his father, Kim Jong-il. \n \n The most influential official to have been executed was Jang Song-thaek, Kim\u2019s uncle and second-in-command. Jang, denounced as a \u201ctraitor for all ages\u201d, was killed in December 2013 after being found guilty of treason and other crimes against the North Korean state. \n \n In April last year, Hyon Yong-chol, a former defence chief, was executed after falling asleep during a military rally attended by Kim. \n \n The JoongAng Ilbo speculated that the executions could herald a new round of purges, intended as a show of force by Kim in retaliation for recent defections, including that of Thae Yong-ho, deputy ambassador at the North Korean embassy in London. \n \n The regime denounced Thae as \u201chuman scum \u201d, and claimed he had fled to South Korea to escape charges of misusing government funds, selling state secrets and committing child rape. \n \n \n \n The JoongAng Ilbo said the defections had \u201crekindled talk of instability and disunity among the North Korean elite\u201d. ||||| North Korean leader Kim Jong-un executed two top officials publicly, killing them with an anti-aircraft gun, a source with special knowledge of North Korea told the JoongAng Ilbo.One was apparently killed for nodding off during a meeting with Kim.The executed men were Hwang Min, former agricultural minister, and Ri Yong-jin, who had a senior position in the education ministry, possibly as high as minister level.\u201cI have the information that ministers of agriculture and education were publicly executed on a special order from Kim Jong-un,\u201d said the source. The executions took place at a military academy in Pyongyang, he said, and an anti-aircraft gun was used.If the report is true, it would mark the first execution ordered by Kim Jong-un from outside the Workers\u2019 Party and military.The report may be interpreted as a new reign of terror in North Korea prompted by a series of defections by senior officials that has rekindled talk of instability and disunity among the North Korean elite.\u201cOne of the executed is Hwang Min, a former agricultural minister,\u201d said the source. \u201cI understand he was executed because policy proposals he had pushed for were seen as a direct challenge to the Kim Jong-un leadership.\"The source did not elaborate what the proposal was or why it was seen as a challenge to the leader. Hwang was replaced by Ko In-ho at a meeting of the rubber-stamp parliament in late June before apparently being executed.The other ill-fated official was Ri Yong-jin, who the source said was a ministerial-level official at the education ministry.\u201cHe incurred the wrath of Kim after he dozed off during a meeting presided over by Kim. He was arrested on site and intensively questioned by the state security ministry. He was executed after other charges such as corruption were found during the probe.\u201dIn North Korea, there are two ministries related to education: the Ministry of Common Education and Ministry of Higher Education, which are headed by Kim Sung-du and Thae Hyong-chol, who is also president of Kim Il Sung University. A government official said the ill-fated Ri could have had a minister-level position at one of the two.Since taking over after his father\u2019s death in late 2011, Kim has carried out a series of executions of party and military officials. The most high-profile was the December 2013 execution of Jang Song-thaek, Kim\u2019s uncle and former political guardian. Another high-profile execution was that of Hyon Yong-chol, North Korea\u2019s former defense chief, who South Korean intelligence said was executed by firing squad in April 2015 on charges of dozing off during a meeting attended by the supreme leader.If the report of the two executions is true, they may have been related to a series of defections by senior North Korean officials with privileged backgrounds.The recent defection of Thae Yong-ho, formerly No. 2 at the North Korean embassy in London, sparked speculation that there is disunity among the North\u2019s inner circle and a decline in faith in the Kim regime. The young leader could have felt the need to impose a sense of terror among elite officials to reinforce their loyalty.\u201cThe recent series of defections by top officials is less a looming sign of the collapse of the North Korean regime than the outcome of the North\u2019s wrong policies for its overseas officials,\u201d said Kim Byung-yeon, professor of economics at Seoul National University, who specializes in the North Korean economy.North Korean officials overseas are said to be under growing pressure to find source of hard currency to be transferred to Pyongyang after sanctions were slapped on the country in March, following its fourth nuclear test in January and a long-range missile launch the following month. Such pressure could have driven elite officials like Thae to opt to defect to the South rather than face dire consequences back home after failing to find the motherland extra sources of foreign exchange, observers say.President Park Geun-hye said Monday that her government would continue to \u201csend a message of hope for North Korean people for the life of liberty and dignity.\u201dAt a meeting with senior secretaries at the Blue House, Park said, \u201cImproving human rights conditions in North Korea is a humanitarian issue that cannot be put off any more and a cornerstone to bringing about an era of peace on the Korean Peninsula.\u201dShe called on the military to maintain readiness so the North Korean regime can be brought to \u201cself-destruction\u201d should it choose to provoke the South violently.BY KANG JIN-KYU, LEE YOUNG-JONG [kang.jinkyu@joongang.co.kr]",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Kim Jong Un has allegedly had two men put to death using a method he's been said to have used before: by anti-aircraft gun. South Korean newspaper JoongAng Ilbo reports by way of an unnamed source that two men were publicly executed earlier this month. It identifies the men as Ri Yong Jin, a high-ranking official in the education ministry, and Hwang Min, the former agriculture minister. The men's alleged offenses: Ri fell asleep while in a meeting with Kim and was \"arrested on site and intensively questioned\"; corruption charges followed. In Hwang's case, unspecified \"policy proposals he had pushed for were seen as a direct challenge to the Kim Jong Un leadership,\" says the source. While Kim is thought to have ordered at least 70 executions since taking power in 2011, Bloomberg highlights one difference with the current case: If Ri and Hwang were in fact put to death, they are the first from outside the Workers' Party or the military to have met that fate on Kim's orders. The Guardian notes the news has not been independently verified, nor has it been announced by the KCNA. The South Korean newspaper suggests the executions were in part prompted by a high-profile defection and carried out as a way of reasserting control over the country's elite. (Ri's alleged situation has echoes of another from 2015.)",

Steve Saunders said police are not considering charging the boy's parents. \n \n A Facebook group called Justice for Harambe gathered more than 7,500 \"likes\" in less than a day. \n \n \"This page was created to raise awareness of Harambe's murder,\" the page states. \"We wish to see charges brought against those responsible!\" \n \n A Change.org petition was created Sunday morning by a user named Shelia Hurt also called for action against the boy's parents.

Video shows the boy being dragged through the shallow moat. The gorilla then stops, with the child below him and looking up at him. \n \n But reports say this was only a partial picture, and the boy was dragged by the 17-year-old male western lowland gorilla for about 10 minutes. \n \n He was taken to a local hospital and although no information about his condition has been released, it is believed he will fully recover. \n \n Image copyright Reuters Image caption The 17-year-old male gorilla, Harambe, was brought to the zoo in 2014 \n \n Zoo director Thane Maynard said: \"[The officials] made a tough choice and they made the right choice because they saved that little boy's life. It could have been very bad.\" \n \n He said a tranquilliser would not have had a quick enough effect. \n \n Mr Maynard said that although the boy was not under attack, he \"certainly was at risk\". \n \n He added: \"We are all devastated that this tragic accident resulted in the death of a critically endangered gorilla. This is a huge loss for the zoo family and the gorilla population worldwide.\" \n \n Harambe was born in captivity in Texas and moved to Cincinnati zoo in 2014, where it was hoped he could be part of a breeding programme. Cincinnati zoo has had the largest number of western lowland gorilla births in the US. \n \n Protective \n \n In a similar incident in 1986 on the island of Jersey, a Crown dependency of the UK, a five-year-old boy fell into a gorilla enclosure. \n \n He lost consciousness and a silverback gorilla called Jambo famously stood guard over him, protecting him from other gorillas and stroking his back. When the boy came round he started to cry and the gorillas retreated, allowing keepers and an ambulanceman to rescue the child. \n \n A life-sized statue of Jambo fetched \u00a318,000 ($26,000) at auction and he even appeared on Jersey stamps. \n \n The western lowland subspecies inhabits west African rainforests and is the most numerous, although exact figures are not known. There are more than 500 in zoos worldwide. \n \n The shooting of the lions last week in Santiago, Chile, brought criticism from activists. Zoo officials said no fast-activating tranquillisers were available. \n \n The man had jumped into the enclosure and stripped naked. ||||| Those are some of the words the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden used Sunday in a contrite explanation for the death of Harambe, a 17-year-old western lowland gorilla killed on Saturday to save a boy who slipped into the zoo's habitat. \n \n The boy was in \"imminent danger,\" leaving the zoo's Dangerous Animal Response Team with no option but to shoot the 450-pound gorilla, zoo director Thane Maynard said in a statement on Facebook . Tranquilizers may not have taken effect in time to save the boy while the dart might have agitated the animal, worsening the situation, Maynard said. \n \n \"We are heartbroken about losing Harambe, but a child's life was in danger and a quick decision had to be made,\" he said. \n \n The words did little to assuage an angry chorus of critics who believed the gorilla's death was unnecessary. Many blamed the boy's mother for failing to look after her son.

You all killed him for protecting a child [whose] parents couldn't contain their own children!!\" said one commenter on the zoo's Facebook page. \n \n 'Not a good scene' \n \n The boy, 4, was released unhurt from a Cincinnati hospital Saturday and the zoo opened on Sunday. Gorilla World, home to nine western lowland gorillas, was closed. \n \n The incident drew widespread attention as dramatic video spread across the Internet showing Harambe dragging the boy like a rag doll through the water across the habitat. \n \n The boy climbed through a barrier and fell some 15 feet to a shallow moat in Harambe's enclosure, Maynard said. \n \n Kimberley Ann Perkins O'Connor, who captured some of the incident on her phone, told CNN she overheard the boy joking to his mother about going into the water. \n \n Suddenly, a splash drew the crowd's attention to the boy in the water. The crowd started screaming, drawing Harambe's attention to the boy, O'Connor said. \n \n At first, it looked like Harambe was trying to help the boy, O'Connor said. He stood him up and pulled up his pants. \n \n As the crowd's clamors grew, Harambe tossed the boy into a corner of the moat, O'Connor said, which is when she started filming. Harambe went over to the corner and shielded the boy with his body as the boy's mother yelled \"Mommy's right here.\" \n \n The crowd's cries appeared to agitate Harambe anew, O'Connor said, and the video shows him grabbing the boy by the foot. He dragged him through the water and out of the moat atop the habitat, O'Connor said. \n \n By that point, \"It was not a good scene,\" she said. When the boy tried to back away the gorilla \"aggressively\" pulled him back into his body \"and really wasn't going to let him get away,\" she said. \n \n O'Connor left before the shooting. When asked if the the barrier could be easily penetrated by a child, she said it would take some effort. \n \n \"Unfortunately, it was a bad situation where a 4-year-old didn't have the attention of his mother for seconds,\" she said. \"I don't think it was as easy as standing up and falling in. He actually had to climb under something, through some bushes and then into the moat.\" \n \n 'Captivity is never acceptable' \n \n The zoo defended its safety barriers, saying this is the first time Gorilla World has experienced a breach since the exhibit opened in 1978. The exhibit is inspected regularly by the Association of Zoos & Aquariums and the United States Department of Agriculture, and adheres to safety guidelines, according to the zoo. \n \n \"The safety of our visitors and our animals is our No. 1 priority,\" Maynard said. \"The barrier that we have in place has been effective for 38 years. Nevertheless, we will study this incident as we work toward continuous improvement for the safety of our visitors and animals.\" \n \n Zoo officials said the incident lasted about 10 minutes. According to a Cincinnati Fire Department incident report, the gorilla was violently dragging and throwing the child, leading the zoo's emergency responders to decide to put the gorilla down \"to save the child,\" the zoo said. The response team includes full-time keepers, veterinarians, maintenance workers, zoo leadership and security staff. All members are trained and certified annually by the Hamilton County Sheriff's Office. \n \n The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said on Twitter the tragic episode was the latest proof that \"captivity is never acceptable for gorillas or other primates.\" Western lowland gorillas are critically endangered in the wild, numbering fewer than 175,000, according to the zoo. An additional 765 gorillas dwell in zoos worldwide. \n \n 1/4 Yet again, captivity has taken an animal's life. The enclosure should have been surrounded by a secondary barrier to prevent this. \u2014 PETA (@peta) May 29, 2016 \n \n 2/4 Gorillas have shown that they can be protective of smaller living beings & react the same way any human would to a child in danger. \u2014 PETA (@peta) May 29, 2016 \n \n 3/4 Even under the \"best\" circumstances, captivity is never acceptable for gorillas or other primates & in cases like this it's even deadly. \u2014 PETA (@peta) May 29, 2016 \n \n 4/4 This tragedy is exactly why PETA urges families to stay away from any facility that displays animals as sideshows for humans to gawk at. \u2014 PETA (@peta) May 29, 2016 \n \n The zoo had its share of defenders and supporters, who weighed in on Facebook acknowledging the difficulty of its decision. \n \n \"I know that was a tough decision for the zoo to make,\" one commenter said. \"Now if that child was killed because they (the zoo) didn't do anything then everyone would be up in arms.\" \n \n As another person said, \"My heart goes out to all of the Zoo Family at this time. I am well aware of how difficult the decision was and it could not have been an easy one for the Zoo's Animal Response Team especially as the staff at the Zoo goes above and beyond providing compassionate care for all the animals entrusted to them. \n \n \"It is unfortunate that to save the life of a child, an animal had to be sacrificed. Thank you to all the Zoo Staff for all you do for the animals. Wishing you peace.\" ||||| The creator of this petition wishes to extend her thanks and appreciation for the support in the quest to seek justice for Harambe. It is understood that the Hamilton County Prosecutor\u2019s Office will make a statement on this matter on Monday, June 6. The creator of this petition will respect the decision made by the Hamilton County Prosecutor's Office in this matter. \n \n There has been a lot of talk in the press (especially cable news), vilifying the petition, vilifying its creator, Sheila, and making this seem like a race-baited witch-hunt for the mother and that the intent of the petition is to get kids removed from the home. Nothing can be further from the truth. Ms. Hurt condemns the racially-motivated statements made on news channels and in news stories on the internet, especially the statements that involve the legal record of a family member who was not present during the incident. Ms. Hurt feels these journalistic attacks on the family are unnecessary, hurtful, and they do not further the cause of seeking justice for Harambe. \n \n It is understood that there is a petition is created in regards to closing down this one with claims that this is a racially-driven smear campaign that defames the mother involved in the incident. Once again, these allegations are false and upsetting toward Ms. Hurt whose only goal was to ensure that proper legal action was taken in this matter. \n \n It is important to note that Ms. Hurt\u2019s petition has not, and will not mention the name of the family involved. There is a reason this petition has not and will not state the family members' names or any personal information about them: It is wrong and it is up to the proper authorities to have that information and any other information they need to investigate this matter. This information is only of use to Hamilton County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, not the public, and certainly not of use to anyone who signs this petition. \n \n The creator of this petition requests that no one harasses, threatens, or otherwise disturbs the family involved in this sad incident. Please understand that any disturbance toward the family may result in legal action being taken against you by the family and any involved parties. Only Hamilton County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, Hamilton County Job and Family Services, and Cincinnati Police Department should be in contact with the family. \n \n Three things matter in the case of Justice for Harambe: \n \n *Ensuring that the children of the involved family are safe. \n \n *That the parents have necessary support they need to keep the children safe and that they have access to supportive services that will help them provide a safe environment. \n \n *That proper LEGAL action is taken in this matter and responsible parties are held accountable if the investigation finds that there was negligence involved. \n \n We understand no parent is perfect, kids are curious and can slip away, but we do get concerned when a child was at risk for serious injury and death in one of the safest settings around. It is upsetting that people vilify the Cincinnati Zoo, an institution that has done so much work in trying to turn the tide against extinction in several critically endangered species. If any of you have heard of the Sumatran rhino calf born recently- that was made possible BECAUSE of the research on Sumatran rhino reproduction at Cincinnati Zoo. The sire was born at the Cincinnati Zoo, and research conducted at the zoo ensured that the mother maintained a healthy pregnancy resulting in a healthy female calf. \n \n The zoo has made modifications to its Gorilla World viewing area and as announced in September, 2015, a new Gorilla World viewing area will be ready in Summer 2017. A sad incident at the Cincinnati Zoo has prompted this petition. On May 28, 2016 an unattended four year-old boy was able to crawl through a series of barriers at the Gorilla World enclosure. The child fell an estimated 10 to 12 feet into the moat surrounding the habitat. The 17 year-old male Western Lowland Gorilla named Harambe then got a hold of the boy. The gorilla was perceived as dragging and throwing the boy. The zoo made the last-resort decision to shoot Harambe because of the increased risk of aggression if a tranquilizer was used in such close proximity to a human. This heartbreaking decision was made in the best interests of keeping the child and the public safe.This beautiful gorilla lost his life because the boy's parents did not keep a closer watch on the child. We the undersigned believe that the child would not have been able to enter the enclosure under proper parental supervision. Witnesses claim that they heard the child state that he wished to go into the enclosure and was actively trying to breach the barriers. This should have prompted the parents to immediately remove the child from the vicinity. It is believed that the situation was caused by parental negligence and the zoo is not responsible for the child's injuries and possible trauma.We the undersigned want the parents to be held accountable for the lack of supervision and negligence that caused Harambe to lose his life. We the undersigned feel the child's safety is paramount in this situation. We believe that this negligence may be reflective of the child's home situation. We the undersigned actively encourage an investigation of the child's home environment in the interests of protecting the child and his siblings from further incidents of parental negligence that may result in serious bodily harm or even death.Please sign this petition to encourage the Cincinnati Zoo, Hamilton County Child Protection Services, and Cincinnati Police Department hold the parents responsible.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Did the gorilla have to die? The Cincinnati Zoo is facing an angry backlash for shooting Harambe, an endangered gorilla, dead after a 4-year-old boy fell in its enclosure Saturday, CNN reports. Protesters who accuse the zoo of using excessive force gathered outside the zoo Sunday and the #JusticeforHarambe movement has started a petition to have the boy's parents investigated for negligence. The zoo, however, says that while it is devastated by the death of the male western lowland gorilla, the boy was in imminent danger and tranquilizers would not have worked quickly enough. A witness says that after the boy fell 15 feet into in the enclosure, the gorilla seemed protective at first, but he became agitated as visitors screaming and started dragging the boy through a moat. A witness tells CNN that to get into the enclosure when his mother was distracted, the boy had to \"climb under something, through some bushes and then into the moat.\" He was released from a hospital on Saturday night and his parents issued a statement thanking the zoo and saying the boy is \"doing just fine,\" the Cincinnati Enquirer reports. \"We know that this was a very difficult decision for them, and that they are grieving the loss of their gorilla,\" they said. The BBC notes that a similar incident in Britain in 1986 had a happier ending. When a 5-year-old boy fell into a gorilla enclosure on the island of Jersey and fractured his skull, a male silverback named Jambo stood guard, stroking the boy and keeping other gorillas away until he was rescued.",

The boy climbed through the barrier around the gorilla enclosure just before 4 p.m. Saturday. The incident resulted in the shooting and killing of a 17-year-old gorilla, Harambe, at the zoo's Gorilla World exhibit.",

    "document": "President Trump recently asked his lawyers for their advice on the possibility of pardoning Paul Manafort and other aides accused of crimes, his lawyer said Thursday. \n \n The subject of pardoning Manafort came as Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman faced multiple charges of bank fraud and tax evasion in an Alexandria criminal case, Trump attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani said in an interview. \n \n Trump\u2019s lawyers counseled the president against the idea of pardoning anyone linked to the investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election, according to Giuliani, saying Trump should at least wait until special counsel Robert S. Mueller III has concluded his probe. Giuliani said the president agreed and did not push the issue further. \n \n \u201cHe said yes,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cHe agreed with us.\u201d \n \n Giuliani said Trump was seeking advice in the wake of a spate of pardons he granted earlier this summer, including for a woman whom Kim Kardashian had lobbied the White House to release. Giuliani said he and fellow personal attorney Jay Sekulow had advised waiting to see whether Mueller delivers a damning report that accuses the president of trying to block a federal probe of his campaign\u2019s contacts with Russians. \n \n White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters Wednesday that she \u201cwasn\u2019t aware\u201d of any discussions of Trump pardoning Manafort and that the topic was \u201cnot something that\u2019s been up for discussion.\u201d \n \n On Thursday, in the wake of Giuliani\u2019s comment, Sanders said the pardon topic is not under active consideration \u201cin the White House.\u201d \n \n \u201cThis pardon is not something being discussed in the White House and the president has not made a decision on pardoning Paul Manafort or anyone else,\u201d she said in a statement. \n \n The exact timing and nature of the pardon discussion is unclear. \n \n A senior administration official said the president discussed the pros and cons of granting pardons to Manafort and others linked to a probe of his campaign \u201ca few weeks ago.\u201d \n \n Giuliani initially said he and Trump had the conversation \u201cthree to five weeks ago\u201d but later corrected his statement to say he believed they discussed it several weeks earlier, in June. Giuliani clarified in a follow-up call to The Post that his conversation with Trump was a general discussion about potential pardons for a range of people under investigation, including but not limited to Manafort. \n \n Some experts have argued Trump could expose himself to more legal danger if he were to pardon aides who are witnesses in the Mueller probe, because Mueller is examining the president\u2019s own conduct and whether he sought to obstruct justice. \n \n Giuliani acknowledged that risk. \n \n \u201cWe sat him down and said you\u2019re not considering these other pardons with anybody involved in the investigation. He said yes, absolutely, I understand,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cThe real concern is whether Mueller would turn any pardon into an obstruction charge.\u201d \n \n Other Trump associates who have pleaded guilty as part of Mueller\u2019s investigation include former national security adviser Michael Flynn, former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos and Trump campaign aide Rick Gates. \n \n Mueller\u2019s findings are supposed to be provided in a report to Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, who would then decide whether any evidence of wrong\u00addoing was serious enough that it should be presented to Congress to consider for impeachment proceedings. \n \n Trump has repeatedly decried the government\u2019s treatment of Manafort \u2014 who a jury found guilty Tuesday on eight counts of tax- and bank-fraud charges. Manafort refused to cooperate with Mueller investigators seeking his information about the Trump campaign and instead took his chances at trial. \n \n On Tuesday, the president told reporters that Manafort was a \u201cgood man\u201d and that he felt sorry for him. \n \n Trump tweeted his support of Manafort on Wednesday while criticizing Michael Cohen, his former personal lawyer, who pleaded guilty Tuesday to five counts of tax evasion, one count of making a false statement to a bank and two campaign finance violations: willfully causing an illegal corporate contribution and making an excessive campaign contribution. \n \n \u201cI feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201c \u2018Justice\u2019 took a 12 year old tax case, among other things, applied tremendous pressure on him and, unlike Michael Cohen, he refused to \u2018break\u2019 \u2014 make up stories in order to get a \u2018deal.\u2019 Such respect for a brave man!\u201d \n \n Inside the West Wing, the prospect of a Manafort pardon is met with near universal opposition. Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, White House counsel Donald F. McGahn and attorney Emmet T. Flood are all opposed. Aides are trying to keep Trump from even discussing the matter. After Ainsley Earhardt, the Fox News anchor, said Wednesday night that Trump discussed a pardon while appearing on Fox News, Sanders asked her to clarify her comments that she did not hear Trump say that, according to a person familiar with the matter. Officials are increasingly frustrated with Giuliani inside the West Wing. \n \n Trump has admiringly talked about how Manafort did not \u201cflip\u201d on him and was ebullient when Judge T.S. Ellis said that the prosecution only wanted to go after Manafort to get him. Asked about a pardon, one senior White House official said: \u201cWhat does it accomplish? You pardon him, it doesn\u2019t get rid of the Mueller probe, it causes you more headaches, he still has another trial, you have more Republicans coming after you.\u201d \n \n \u201cLegally he\u2019s entitled to pardon Manafort,\u201d said Alan Dershowitz, a Harvard professor that Trump likes to watch on TV. \u201cMy advice to the president is don\u2019t tweet, don\u2019t pardon, don\u2019t testify, don\u2019t fire.\u201d \n \n That was a major shift for Trump, who in April called it a \u201cnational disgrace\u201d when federal investigators raided Cohen\u2019s home and office as part of an investigation into his efforts during the campaign to squelch embarrassing stories about Trump. \n \n Cohen implicated Trump directly in some of his acts when he pleaded guilty Tuesday, saying he arranged to pay off two women to keep their stories of alleged affairs with Trump from becoming public before Election Day \u2014 in coordination with the then-candidate. \n \n Trump has repeatedly expressed his anger at how federal prosecutors had \u201cbeat up\u201d and mistreated Manafort. The president\u2019s critics argue that Trump\u2019s public tweets are a thinly-veiled message to Manafort, that he supports his refusal to cooperate with Mueller and is willing to pardon him in the future. \n \n Giuliani said Trump\u2019s concern for Manafort is what motivates him to consider a pardon. \n \n \u201cHe feels Manafort has been mistreated. Nobody in a case like this gets raided in the middle of the night, put in solitary confinement,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cThey tried to crack him and it didn\u2019t work. Over the last two to three weeks, he\u2019s expressed anger and frustration about how he\u2019s been treated.\u201d \n \n This story has been updated. \n \n Rosalind S. Helderman contributed to this report. ||||| On Wednesday, several aides dismissed the news about Mr. Cohen as just another bad headline lacking the silver bullet that they say the special counsel would need to prove that the president conspired with Russian officials. \n \n Mr. Trump spent the early hours of Wednesday tweeting \u2014 he called the convicted Mr. Manafort a \u201cbrave man\u201d who, unlike Mr. Cohen, \u201crefused to \u2018break\u2019\u201d or \u201cmake up stories in order to get a \u2018deal.\u2019\u2019\u2019 He also monitored headlines, as he did after his news conference with Mr. Putin. In the interview with Fox News, he asserted that money for the payments to the women had come not from his campaign, but from his own accounts. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t know if you know,\u201d Mr. Trump said during the interview, \u201cbut I tweeted about the payments. But they didn\u2019t come out of the campaign.\u201d Campaign finance laws still prohibit Mr. Trump from making unreported payments related to the campaign, regardless of where they came from. Neither payment was disclosed to the Federal Election Commission. \n \n On Air Force One on Tuesday night on the way back from a rally in West Virginia, Mr. Trump repeatedly minimized the news, telling aides that the legal developments were not about him, but about Mr. Manafort and Mr. Cohen. He also groused over the optics of the rally, telling a person close to him that the crowd seemed flat and that some chairs were empty. \n \n By Wednesday, Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers were arguing privately that Mr. Cohen\u2019s admission and guilty plea to violating campaign finance laws was a punch but not a knockout blow, and were assessing what options they had for fighting back. They stressed that Mr. Cohen had said repeatedly in previous accounts that Mr. Trump was not aware of his payment to Ms. Clifford, known as Stormy Daniels.",

    "document": "Cops: 2nd man charged in man killed over dice game \n \n Derrick A. Hillard, 37, of the 8300 block of South King Drive, has been charged with with first-degree murder and one count of unlawful use of a weapon by a felon for the Oct. 6 slaying of Jamal Harmon, said police. \n \n A second man has been charged this evening in connection with a 2013 slaying of a 19-year-old man whose body was dumped in a South Side alley after an argument over a dice game, said officials. \n \n Hillard's uncle, Andre Davis, 52, of the 8200 block of South Eberhart Avenue, was charged earlier this week in connection with the slaying. \n \n Prosecutors had said earlier that Harmon had been at a party at a previous home of the nephew near the 6500 block of Ross Avenue, when he got into an argument with the nephew about losing money in a dice game. \n \n Prosecutors said the nephew went into the house and came back with a gun and shot Harmon. Another attacker also shot Harmon. A witness said Harmon was still alive after being shot, and Davis ordered another person to help him move Harmon. They carried Harmon to a trunk of a Cadillac, said prosecutors. \n \n Davis drove away with Harmon in the trunk and witnesses said he told them he was going to find somewhere to dump Harmon's body, said prosecutors at Davis' bond hearing.

Read part two here. \n \n On a summer day in 1980, 19-year-old Andre Davis stepped off a train 125 miles south of his native Chicago. He expected his visit would last the summer. Little did he know he wouldn't return home for more than 30 years. \n \n Andre had just graduated from high school and traveled to the central Illinois town of Rantoul, population 20,000, to learn his father's business. Richard Davis\u2014known as \"Crazy Legs\" for his brilliant moves on the dance floor\u2014was a disc jockey serving nearby Chanute Air Force Base. \n \n Andre had grown up on Chicago's south side, where he lived with his mother, Emma, who owned a beauty salon. Emma and Richard had divorced when Andre was two, and though Andre didn't see much of his father, he had an extended family to rely on. Andre's grandfather had moved to Chicago from the south in the 1920s, part of the initial Great Migration of African-Americans. He started a corner store and was later successful in real estate. In decades of difficulty for so many blacks, members of the Davis family attended college and went on to lucrative careers. They were, as several of them proudly put it, pillars of the community\u2014lawyers, doctors, entrepreneurs, teachers, and scholars. \n \n Andre's mother recalls that her son was a good student but also a \"typical teenager.\" \"He always did very well in school, but was bored by it,\" she says. She believes that boredom, perhaps accentuated by the sporadic presence of his father, led to Andre acting out. In his early teens, Andre started breaking curfew and running away from home for short periods. A few years later, he faced an auto-theft charge for what he calls \"a joy ride\" that left him in the hospital. \"He was hanging out with the bad boys on the block,\" Emma Davis says, \"and they were a bad influence on him.\" \n \n Some time spent in Rantoul, his family thought, would be good for him. \n \n Rantoul was a far cry from Chicago. Historically, the town has averaged less than a murder per year. Blacks accounted for just 10 percent of the population. Former police chief Eldon Quick says that gangs have always been nonexistent and race relations in the town \"were not a big deal.\" Still, the small African-American population felt it was necessary to stick together. Andre's father had a big network\u2014most of the parties he DJed were thrown on the base, where Crazy Legs was the man to know. And so Andre instantly had a network, too. \n \n When Andre arrived at the train station, he was greeted by Crazy Legs and his friend Donald \"Don Juan\" Douroux. Andre quickly took to Don, who had enlisted in the Air Force several years prior, was discharged in 1979, and decided to stick around Rantoul with a girlfriend while attending nearby Parkland College. It was also through his father that Andre met Lutellis \"Sonny\" Tucker. Sonny had five kids, was divorced, and lived two blocks from Crazy Legs. Sonny's kids came and stayed with him occasionally, but mostly they lived with their mother in Gary, Indiana, Sonny's hometown. Sonny's brother, Maurice, who was around Andre's age, had recently moved into Sonny's house. \n \n Sonny, a cook at Chanute, had been convicted in April of 1978 of felony theft and placed on two years' conditional discharge. On one occasion, Don would later claim, he overheard one of the Tucker brothers thanking a police officer from Gary for beating him up instead of taking him to jail after he was caught stealing a car. \n \n The crew would often drink together and get into wrestling matches. Andre was only 5'7\" and 130 pounds, but he was muscular enough to hold his own with Maurice Tucker, who was six inches taller and 50 pounds heavier. Neither of the two had found work, so they'd get together and lift weights, drink beer, smoke weed, and hang around the NCO club on base. When Sonny's kids weren't staying with them on the weekends, the Tucker brothers often threw parties at their house on Eastview Avenue \"for all the brothers,\" as Don put it. \n \n Friday, August 8, 1980, was steaming. Andre headed over to the Tuckers' at around 10 AM to waste the day away with Maurice while Sonny was in and out of the house. They took out weights from the utility room, where Maurice slept, and lifted barbells in the backyard under the blazing sun. They played records. Most ambitiously, they climbed the generous fruit trees that leaned from a neighbor's house into the yard and picked apples and pears. But mostly they sat on the stoop drinking beer and cheap Wild Irish Rose wine and listening to breaks. \n \n Andre would later recall that when he left the house, sometime after 6 PM, he saw a little girl playing outside. He remembered telling her to stay out of the garbage can she was getting into. \n \n The girl, Brianna Stickel, was adorably blonde and had recently turned three. Earlier that day her stepfather, Rand Spragg, who was stationed at Chanute, had worked until noon before taking Brianna's mother, Becky Spragg, to apply for a job at the local Holiday Inn Jr. The couple then picked up Brianna and her 18-month-old brother, Simon, from their nursery and returned home. The kids hadn't napped yet, so the family lay down to rest together, as they often did. \n \n The children woke first, around 6 PM. When Rand got up, he noticed that Brianna and Simon had gotten into the fridge; Brianna had spilled some juice. Becky took Simon for a bath, and Brianna was told to go play outside. The heat was so intense that the little girl was clad only in yellow underwear. Rand went to the window and saw her sitting beneath the large shade tree, biting her nails. \n \n After wiping up the spilled juice, Rand squeezed the liquid out of the mop and turned again to the window. Brianna was gone. He went outside and circled the house. No Brianna. He went inside and asked Becky if the little girl was with her. She wasn't. \n \n At around 6:30 PM, Rand began knocking on doors. He went to the Tuckers' house and heard a stereo playing on low volume. He knocked but got no answer, figuring that somebody had left the stereo on. He then got in his car to continue the hunt. The Spraggs didn't own a phone, so Becky flagged down a passing police car and told the officer that Brianna was missing. Officer Ronald McLemore began checking around the neighborhood. \n \n Brianna Stickel's stepfather last saw her alive in the family's front yard, where she was sitting beneath a large shade tree. \n \n Courtesy Judi Stickel \n \n Shortly before 8 PM, as the officer was conducting his search, \"a black man come up there in a car\u2014I don't remember the car\u2014and he knocked on the [Tuckers'] door,\" Becky later recalled. It was Don Douroux. He was carrying a glass of Kool-Aid and wearing a T-shirt with the words master blaster emblazoned on the front and don juan on the back. A short while later, Rand and Becky saw Don walk out the back door of the house and lock it up. Becky walked up and asked if they could look for Brianna inside. Perhaps she had wandered over? At first Don demurred\u2014it wasn't his house, he said. But he relented and they searched the house while he supervised. No sign of Brianna. Rand did notice a wet red stain on the twin bed in the messy utility room where Maurice slept. He passed his finger across the stain, but chalked it up to \"a single man living there and having girlfriends, you know,\" he later said. The room had clothes strewn everywhere. Don saw the Spraggs to the front door, and went to lock up the back. \n \n As Rand and Becky stood in front of the Tucker house debating what to do next, Don emerged. He was shaking and crying, borderline hysterical, and dropped the glass of Kool-Aid he was drinking on the front porch. Becky thought he was having an epileptic seizure. He was silent for a bit and then said there was something on the bed in the back room under a pile of clothes. \"I can't look,\" he said. Rand went in with Simon and pulled back the sheets on the bed in Maurice's room. There was Brianna, lying on her stomach, her head turned to one side. Rand rolled her over. She wasn't breathing, and she had no pulse. Her lips were purple. He began CPR, and saw some vomit. He didn't want Simon to continue to see the disturbing scene and took the baby out of the room. As Simon whimpered, Rand went back to resume CPR on Brianna. He got no response. \n \n At 8:15 PM, Officer McLemore received an ambulance call directing him to the Tuckers' house. He raced over and found a crowd standing around the home. Becky was outside crying. Rand escorted McLemore to the utility room, where Brianna lay limp and naked, with bloodstains on her genitals. The blankets were all in a ball at the end of the bed, wet with blood. The officer performed CPR on Brianna for two minutes. It was futile. Don told the officer that \"the person that done this is at 1056 Eastview\"\u2014Don's own house, the next block over. \n \n Sergeant Arthur Wiseman and Quick, the police chief, went to the address and knocked on the door. Don, who had raced home ahead of them, answered the door and let them in. Andre was inside, watching television. Wiseman later said Don was \"acting somewhat nervous\" and said he wished to speak to one of the lawmen. He went outside with Chief Quick. Wiseman stayed inside with Andre, who appeared \"nonchalant or uninvolved in what was going on.\" Andre told Wiseman he didn't know why the sergeant was there, and Wiseman stayed quiet about the crime. Outside, Don was telling the chief that he'd returned from work to find Andre hiding under a trailer behind the bushes. He said Andre had told him he'd \"been in bed with a woman\" at the Tuckers' when a knock at the bedroom door led him to put his hand over the woman's mouth to keep her silent\u2014and he soon noticed she wasn't breathing. Don told Chief Quick that at first he didn't believe Andre and told him so. He said he went over to the Tuckers' to prove Andre was lying, and found the little girl dead. \n \n \"Everything happened so quick I barely had time to think. I had a brain freeze times a thousand.\u201d \u2014Andre Davis, describing his realization that police were charging him with the rape and murder of a three-year-old girl \n \n Andre later would deny Don's account. He said he never claimed to have been with a woman that day, let alone killed anyone. His recollection was that he left the Tuckers' between 6:15 and 7 PM, when Maurice and Sonny were still at the house\u2014a point on which all parties agreed\u2014and headed over to Don's. Finding nobody there, he said he went to a friend's house across the street and made a phone call. He said he then returned to Don's and waited for him until he came home, which was about 20 minutes later. According to Andre, the two drank some Kool-Aid together and discussed getting high later on, after which Don told him he was going for a run. (Don went over to the Tuckers' instead.) Andre recalled Don returning 20 minutes later, and the police arriving soon after. \n \n Wiseman stepped outside to talk with Don and the chief. He went back into the house and cuffed Andre\u2014who would later say that he thought the police were just taking him in for questioning about a crime that had occurred. They began asking him pointed questions, though, and when he understood he was being charged, he \"went ballistic,\" he would later recall. \"I couldn't understand it. Everything happened so quick I barely had time to think. I had a mind freeze times a thousand.\" He says that as far as the police were concerned, he was guilty. They slapped him around, he claims, hurling racial slurs. \"There was no possibility in their mind that I didn't do it.\" \n \n In the five months leading up to his trial, Andre was held in the Champaign County jail. He barely slept. \"I didn't know what was happening one moment to the next.\" He kept his mind focused on his family; his mother reassured him that he would be acquitted, and told him to pray and stay optimistic. \n \n Andre's trial got under way at the Champaign County Courthouse in January 1981. He wore a beige plaid suit, brown shirt and tie, and green sweater. The strategy of his court-appointed attorney was to finger Don Douroux as being involved in Brianna's death, which would explain why Don would falsely\u2014according to the defense\u2014implicate Andre. It was Don, after all, who had found Brianna. What's more, if Andre had told Don he'd killed a woman he was having sex with, why didn't Don find Brianna on his first sweep of the house? He would have known he was looking for a corpse, after all. \"Donald Douroux knows a lot more about this than he is telling us,\" Andre's lawyer, Donald Parkinson, told the jury. \"I don't know if he did it or not, but I suspect that he knows something more about it than he's telling us. Don Douroux, Don Juan, came home and found a patsy. And from that moment on, he's put this on Andre Davis. And he's putting it on Andre Davis because he's trying to cover for himself or someone else.\" \n \n The state's first witness was pathologist Stanley Bobowski, who testified that Brianna had been suffocated by somebody putting a hand or other object over her mouth and nose. He told the jury she'd been raped at the same time. Though dried blood and feces were found around Brianna's anus, there were no breaks or tears, Bobowski said, which suggested she had not been anally raped. \n \n Next on the stand was Robert Beams, an FBI special agent who headed up the Washington lab where the evidence in the case was tested. At the time, the FBI was the only agency in the country capable of doing sophisticated forensic analysis. Type O-positive blood, the most common blood type in the United States, covering about 45 percent of the population, was found at the scene. Brianna was type O-positive, as is Andre. Moreover, Andre is what's called a \"nonsecretor.\" Eighty percent of Americans are secretors, individuals whose blood type is present in the rest of their fluids. Andre is among the remaining one-fifth of the population who do not have blood-group substances in their saliva, urine, sweat, and semen. Beams told the court that a mattress and bedsheet with semen on them had been sent to him for testing. Both contained no trace of blood-group substances\u2014meaning they came from a nonsecretor, like Andre. \n \n Rantoul police officer Montgomery Portis testified that Andre\u2014after being arrested by Officer Wiseman and advised of his Miranda rights\u2014shook his head in a negative fashion and declined to sign a Miranda form. He was then interrogated further by Portis and Wiseman. During the questioning, Andre told them that he and Don Douroux had been wrestling\u2014which explained why he had fresh, bloodied scratch marks. In the course of undressing Andre at the station, Portis also noticed grass in both his head hair and pubic hair. Andre then changed his story, according to Portis, saying, \"Juan and I is too big to be wrestling.\" Portis testified that Andre then said he didn't know where the scratches came from. \"I didn't rape no little two- or three-year-old white girl,\" Portis recalled Andre saying. \n \n When Don Douroux took the stand, his recollection of Andre's confession was damning. \"He said something similar to that he had killed someone,\" Don testified. \"So I asked him who did he kill and where, and he said it was just a woman who lived down the street next door to a mutual friend of ours, Sonny Tucker.\" \n \n Sonny testified that on the morning of the crime, he left his house at about 10 AM to run some errands. Andre was already there, he recalled. He returned home at around noon with some wine, and shared it with his brother and Andre. \"We were just sitting around and talking, you know.\" Sonny told the jury he stepped out again that afternoon and returned between 5:30 and 6 PM with a friend, Ida Parker, at which time he said Andre and Maurice were still there drinking. Sonny had plans to drive to Gary, Indiana, to visit his parents. Before he departed, he said, Andre left on foot, in the direction of Don Douroux's house. (Prosecutors contended that Andre later returned to the house.) Soon after, Sonny said, he locked up the doors and left, with Maurice and Ida still at the house. He told the jury that was the extent of what he knew about the day's events. \n \n Maurice also took the stand, testifying that after Andre and Sonny were gone, he himself left\u2014with Ida Parker\u2014to go spend the night with relatives in Champaign. Maurice testified that he found out about the killing that very night, at his relatives' house. Someone\u2014he didn't specify who\u2014called him around midnight and told him there had been a child found murdered at his brother's house. He knew Brianna Stickel, he said, \"but she never came inside\" the house. He said he had nothing to do with the crime. \n \n Ida Parker testified that she arrived at the Tuckers' early that evening with Sonny, saw Andre and Sonny leave, then left with Maurice to go to Champaign. \n \n Perhaps the most persuasive testimony came from Jose Raquel. Raquel was the emergency room physician at Burnham City hospital the night Brianna was killed. He described to the jury how he examined Andre's genitals after he was arrested. Raquel testified that the head of Andre's uncircumcised penis had been \"red or recently traumatized.\" The only way a penis can get that traumatized, Raquel said, was \"by forcing it against a tight opening\" when it is erect. Could the penis of a man who had masturbated, or had been walking around without underwear, show the same type of trauma? \"Absolutely not,\" Raquel said. He also said he found \"unmistakably fecal material . . . from the anus of a human being\" in Andre's foreskin. Raquel took saline swabs from Andre that showed no presence of semen or blood, but testified that Andre could have washed them off. \n \n When Andre himself took the stand, he was sure his testimony would convince the jury of his innocence. \"I thought from day one that I would be found not guilty,\" he told me. \"I always believed in justice, and I thought innocence was more powerful than anything else.\" He explained that after he left the Tuckers' house that evening, he made a phone call at a friend's house and waited for Don Douroux at Don's place. He said Don told him he was going for a run and came back 20 minutes later, shortly after which the police arrived. \n \n Asked point-blank on the stand if he had anything to do with Brianna's death, Andre replied, \"No, I didn't.\" He was never at the Tuckers' house without them, he said, and had made no confession to Don. \n \n Phone records were checked, however, and no calls had been made from Andre's friend's house that day, according to testimony from an employee of the Eastern Illinois Telephone Company (the employee also testified that, if it had been a collect call, no record would exist). The prosecutor said in his closing argument that this proved Andre had \"lied, lied, lied.\" Andre's lawyer retorted in his closing argument that Andre was \"confused\" (which certainly didn't help lend credibility to anything else he said on the stand). \"The days are pretty similar when you're not working,\" Parkinson said. \"And you might forget what day you made a phone call.\" \n \n Andre's lawyer focused his closing argument on discrediting Don Douroux. Parkinson pointed out that Don's girlfriend had testified earlier that he had occasionally hit her. And it was Don, not Andre, who was nervous when the police first arrived. \n \n Jane Raley, an attorney with Northwestern University's Center on Wrongful Convictions, knew there was something familiar about Andre Davis when he wrote her seeking help in 2003. \n \n Anjali Pinto \n \n The jury deliberated for just under three hours before delivering a verdict: Andre Davis was guilty of the rape and murder of Brianna Stickel. \"None of us had any doubt,\" Melvin Parker, a juror at the trial, told me more than 30 years later. \n \n When being questioned during jury selection, all potential jurors had to agree that they would be willing to apply the death penalty if it were appropriate. Parker and nine other jurors voted for death for Andre, but two others said they couldn't condone the killing of a human being. Parker and the others pushed, saying they had all agreed in principle during jury selection. But the two holdouts said that, when faced with the real thing, they couldn't vote to put a man to death. Instead, Andre was sentenced by the judge to 80 years in prison without the chance of parole. \n \n Andre was devastated, but still hopeful. He even got a second trial. It turned out that the jury had requested a copy of the transcript of the trial testimony during deliberation, but the bailiff had failed to pass on the request to the judge. \n \n Before the second trial, Andre was offered a deal. If he pleaded guilty, he would serve a maximum of 25 years. Under Illinois law at the time, he would get a day off his sentence for every day he behaved well in prison. The offer on the table, then, was for 12.5 years in prison. Andre declined. \"I would never plead guilty,\" he says. \"Never, never. I was innocent, and that was going to come out some day, I knew it.\" Andre's mother, Emma, encouraged him in that decision. \n \n The second jury heard virtually the same information as the first\u2014though this time around, Don's testimony included a revelation that was not made in his prior testimony and did not appear in prior police records. Don told the jury that Andre had asked him at his house\u2014shortly before Don went to the Tuckers' and discovered Brianna's body\u2014what would happen in a town like Rantoul if a black man killed a white person. And again, in 1983, Andre was found guilty of first-degree murder and received the same sentence of 80 years. Harold Jensen, the judge at the second trial, says now that he had \"no doubt whatsoever\" about Andre's guilt at the time. \"The evidence was quite clear to me, and there was nothing to contradict that evidence.\" \n \n For the first 18 years of his sentence\u2014almost as many years as he'd been alive at the time he was locked up\u2014Andre passed the time at the maximum-security Pontiac Correctional Center by obsessively going over his case and praying to a god he still had faith in. At no time did he ever abandon his belief that he would one day be released. \"I still believed in justice,\" he recalls. \"I did anything I could to keep my sanity.\" \n \n In addition to examining his case, Andre spent his time studying religion. Christianity, Catholicism, Judaism, and Islam, in particular. \"What screamed to me was that in Islam, the biggest pursuit of justice is really emphasized.\" Early into his sentence, in 1984, he converted. His faith sustained him for the hardest part of his sentence\u2014the part that wouldn't arrive for more than 25 years. \n \n He kept himself in shape by exercising in his tiny cell. He did whatever else he could to maintain his mental stability. If you let your bitterness get the better of you in prison, he says, you'll never make it. \"I spent my time reading, watching TV, talking to myself, writing thousands of letters.\" He wrote to the NAACP, to the Nation of Islam, to the Urban League. But the most important letter turned out to be one he received\u2014from an unlikely source. \n \n \"I never adjusted to prison,\" Andre says. \"In my mind, in my spirit, I rejected the fact that I was in that world\u2014I wasn't going to accept that I was in that world.\" He adds: \"I was a captive, so why would I ever accept that?\" \n \n Of all the criminal charges that can land someone in prison, sexual abuse of a child is considered the worst by most inmates and guards. \"Everyone's out to get you,\" Andre says. \"Keeping yourself safe is a constant struggle.\" On top of that, he wanted to assert his will as much as he could, to discourage other prisoners from attacking him and to convince himself that prison hadn't broken him. He says that his constant attempts to protect himself\u2014and to send other prisoners a message\u2014resulted in a mind-set that repeatedly got him in trouble. He racked up one of the longest prison disciplinary records in the state, according to the Chicago Tribune. It eventually caught up with him. \n \n July 20, 1998, was Andre's 37th birthday. It was also the day he was transferred from the maximum-security state prison to the newly built Tamms Correctional Center, the now-notorious supermax facility reserved for the worst of the state's violent criminals. For at least 23 hours a day, Andre, like all Tamms prisoners, would be locked in solitary confinement in a windowless 7-by-12-foot cell. If he was well behaved, he was permitted an hour outside of his cell to get exercise in the yard. In Tamms, Andre didn't eat with other inmates\u2014there was no mess hall. Meals were stuffed through a slot in a steel door. Inmates were not allowed to interact with each other, and they rarely had contact with guards. There was no library, no classroom\u2014even medication was typically passed through the steel door. \n \n An Illinois federal court would later find that \"Tamms imposes drastic limitations on human contact, so much so as to inflict lasting psychological damage and emotional harm on inmates confined there for long periods.\" Amnesty International determined that the facility \"flout[s] international standards for humane treatment.\" (Tamms was finally closed by Governor Pat Quinn on January 4, 2013.) \n \n Judi Stickel says of the man convicted of killing her young niece: \"It became clear to me that Andre was innocent. Nothing added up.\" \n \n Kevin E. Schmidt/Chicago Tribune/MCT via Getty Images \n \n Andre's mother and sister were consistently amazed at his optimism while in prison. During his parents' regular visits, he tried to cheer them up. \n \n Emma always shared her son's conviction that he would one day be freed. When asked if she ever had any doubt about Andre's innocence, Emma's jaw squares up. \"No,\" she says. \"I know my son.\" \n \n Another woman shared Emma's conviction: Judi Stickel, Brianna's aunt. \n \n Stickel had spent years reading and rereading police records and court documents describing the death of her niece. And she came to believe that the accounts witnesses gave police were contradictory. \"It became clear to me that Andre was innocent,\" she told me. \"Nothing added up.\" She sent Andre a letter in 1992, she recalled to the Tribune last year, which he ignored for fear that she had ulterior motives. She kept sending letters until he finally responded, two years later. Stickel then met with Andre's mother. She visited Rantoul. She pored over transcripts, interviewed witnesses herself, and wrote everyone she could think of who might want to hear what she had to say. Finally\u2014more than ten years after she first wrote Andre\u2014Judi Stickel stumbled upon someone who might listen. \n \n In 2003, when he was closing in on a quarter of a century of prison life, Andre\u2014at Stickel's urging and with her help\u2014wrote a desperate letter to a woman named Jane Raley, a law professor at Northwestern University and, since 2000, an attorney at the university's Center on Wrongful Convictions. Stickel had discovered the center and believed that they'd be able to act on Andre's behalf. \n \n Raley is slender and polite, with thin bangs that sometimes fall into her eyes. When she begins talking about her defenses of wrongfully convicted individuals, her calm demeanor vanishes and she can shake with anger. At a recent panel on the use of DNA in wrongful convictions, one of the formerly incarcerated men she works for called her a \"drum major for justice.\" \n \n Raley received Andre's letter, written on lined yellow paper. It was one of the estimated hundreds of letters she'd received in her three years at the Center on Wrongful Convictions, and the words described a scenario familiar to her\u2014though not because of her past work at the center. Raley had, coincidentally, been the backup attorney in the public defender's office during Andre's appeal. \"I knew the case\u2014and we thought he might be innocent,\" she recalled earlier this year, sitting in her small Northwestern office. Several pieces of the investigation seemed strange to her. And the fact that Andre had gotten a second trial suggested to Raley that perhaps other errors had been made\u2014earlier on. \n \n What's more, two juries had decided against the death penalty for Andre. But if any case cried out for an execution, it was the horrific rape and murder of three-year-old child. \"It suggested to me that they had reasonable doubt,\" she says, \"that the evidence was problematic.\" \n \n Raley began parsing court transcripts and police records. The initial police report mentioned something relevant that was never discussed in court: Don Douroux had written in a statement to police that Becky Stickel, Brianna's mother, asked to look for Brianna in Sonny's house because \"the girl visited there frequently.\" Maurice had testified, however, that Brianna had never been in the house. \n \n In addition, a junior high school student who was a neighbor of the Tuckers and had been in his backyard around the time of the crime had a clear view of a black man coming out of the house\u2014yet didn't identify Andre in a police lineup. And hairs consistent with those of an African-American male that were found on Brianna's body did not match Andre's hair (or, for that matter, Don's). \n \n In his letter to Raley, Andre offered to take a DNA test. That, for Raley, was the decisive factor. Guilty men, she felt, typically don't want DNA tests done. \n \n The first of Andre Davis's many letters to Judi Stickel. (Click on the image to read the letter in its entirety.) \n \n Courtesy Judi Stickel \n \n Exoneration through DNA testing is extremely rare. DNA evidence plays no role in 90 to 95 percent of criminal convictions. But exonerating someone based on DNA evidence is, of course, far easier than exonerating defendants in cases in which DNA evidence doesn't exist. Successfully working a non-DNA wrongful-conviction case takes an average of 3,500 hours, according to Lesley Risinger, director of the Last Resort Exoneration Project at Seton Hall University. Those hours, billed to a midlevel associate, would compute to at least $1.5 million. Proving one's innocence through DNA is usually a far less costly and time-consuming endeavor. \n \n Andre, like most inmates, had no money to pay a lawyer. And once an individual is convicted, he has no right to a court-appointed attorney after his initial appeal. If Raley didn't listen to him, Andre's innocence claims likely weren't going to be heard by anyone else. \n \n On February 13, 2004, Raley filed a motion for DNA testing in Andre's case. She foresaw a fight. All states have laws granting some form of postconviction DNA testing. But in Illinois, as in other places, anyone seeking that testing still must meet burdensome criteria. And so prosecutors had the option to force Andre to prove he met the standards before being tested, which would have delayed Raley's motion. \n \n But they didn't. \"To their credit, the state always said, 'Go right ahead and test it, we don't care,'\" Raley says. The problem was that a lot of the evidence in Andre's case was either destroyed or missing. Hairs, swabs, a bloody brown paper towel discovered in the Tuckers' bathroom\u2014all were tested using the technology of the time, but weren't introduced at trial and therefore weren't preserved. Fortunately, the evidence that was introduced\u2014sheets, a mattress, and toilet paper\u2014was stashed in the basement of the Champaign County Courthouse. \n \n Raley sent the material, along with a vial of Brianna's blood and an oral swab from Andre containing his DNA, to Cellmark Diagnostics, a testing lab in North Carolina. \"These sheets and bedding\u2014they were filled with just blood and semen,\" she recalls. \n \n The minimum cost for a DNA test at California's Serological Research Institute (SERI) is $2,200, says Gary Harmor, the lab's executive director. For that price, SERI can test one swab from an individual and compare it with one sample of blood or semen from a piece of evidence. Of course, most cases have far more evidence than just one piece\u2014Harmor is currently working a cold case that's running a $110,000 tab so far. DNA degrades, so old evidence, such as in the Davis case, requires extra testing and is pricier. In addition, there are costs for having the lab prepare a report and for having a lab expert testify at a hearing or trial. The Virginian firm Bode Technology Group charges $1,900 per day plus expenses for an expert witness to appear at a courtroom outside of the local area. \n \n Northwestern University provides the Center on Wrongful Convictions with student help and pays for overhead and the lawyers' salaries. But any money for investigations and DNA testing has to be raised from private sources\u2014and the center receives hundreds of requests annually from prisoners and their families to work their cases. But May 2004 happened to be a time when some money was available. \n \n Cellmark representatives told Raley that they couldn't do anything with the blood on the bedsheets\u2014it was 24 years old and too degraded to be properly tested. The lab could, however, test the semen on the bedding. On November 16, 2004, they called Raley with the results. \n \n This article was reported with assistance from the Investigative Fund at the Nation Institute, with additional support from the Puffin Foundation. \n \n Correction: This article was amended to correct the name of the Center on Wrongful Convictions. \n \n Read part two of this story here. ||||| Andre Davis is charged with murder and kidnapping. \n \n A man who served 32 years in prison for rape and murder before being exonerated by DNA evidence in 2012, faces new murder charges for the death of a man found stabbed and shot in a South Side alley last year. \n \n Andre Davis, 52, of the 8200 block of South Eberhart Avenue, is charged with murder and kidnapping in connection with the death of 19-year-old Jamal Harmon on Oct. 7, 2013, authorities said. On Thursday, he was ordered held without bond. \n \n According to media reports at the time, Davis served more than 30 years in prison for the August 1980 rape and murder of 3-year-old girl Brianna Stickle in downstate Rantoul. \n \n DNA evidence overturned his conviction and he was released from prison in July 2012. Prosecutors did not retry him, claiming it would have been too hard to bring a 32-year-old case to trial. \n \n Top News Photos of the Week \n \n About 15 months later, Harmon was at a party hosted by Davis\u2019 nephew in the 6500 block of South Ross about 3 a.m. on Oct. 7, 2013, authorities said. Harmon and the nephew got into an argument outside of the home over money lost at a dice game during the party. \n \n Davis\u2019 nephew went back into the house, then came back outside with a handgun and shot Harmon, prosecutors allege. A witness said Harmon made sounds after he was shot, indicating he was still alive. \n \n Davis and the witness carried Harmon to the trunk of a Cadillac, prosecutors said. Davis drove off with Harmon in the trunk, telling others he was going to find a spot to dump him. \n \n Harmon\u2019s body was discovered later that morning in an alley in the 7600 block of South Carpenter Street, prosecutors said. He had suffered three gunshot wounds to the face, lower neck and left armpit, and had been stabbed four times. \n \n An autopsy found Harmon died of multiple stab and gunshot wounds, and his death was ruled a homicide, according to the medical examiner\u2019s office. \n \n The next day, Davis told someone he cut Harmon\u2019s throat, prosecutors said. \n \n Along with he 1980 murder conviction, Davis has also previously been charged with attempted murder, aggravated discharge of a weapon, and two counts of aggravated battery, according to court records. He currently faces two misdemeanor counts of DUI. \n \n Copyright SunTimes",

As NBC Chicago explains, Davis served his lengthy prison sentence after being convicted of the 1980 rape and murder of a young girl, but he was released in 2012 after DNA evidence overturned the conviction. He had been a free man since\u2014until this week, when he got arrested and charged with the kidnapping and murder of a 19-year-old, reports the Sun-Times. Police say the victim got into a fight with Davis' nephew during a house party, and the nephew shot him. According to prosecutors, witnesses say the victim was still alive when Davis put the teen into his trunk and said he would find a place to dump the body, reports the Chicago Tribune. He told another witness the next day that he cut the victim's throat, say prosecutors. Both he and his nephew have been charged, and Davis is once again behind bars awaiting trial.

About 60 girls have escaped, according to report, but the majority remain missing despite government efforts to locate them. \n \n \n \n Jubilee Campaign USA \u2013 a non-profit group that supports human rights and religious freedom \u2013 is now raising money to help further the education of several of the girls who have escaped. \n \n \n \n This fits in with one of the organization\u2019s stated goals, which is \u201cto promote and protect vulnerable women and children from bodily harm and sexual exploitation, paying particular attention to the scourge of human trafficking or modern slavery which we oppose however we can, wherever we find it, in all of its forms.\u201d \n \n \n \n \u201cWe will assist 10 of the girl child victims, who courageously escaped the confines of their Boko Haram captors, by sending them to specialized boarding schools where their traumatic experiences may be transformed into empowering triumphs over evil,\u201d said Norris. \n \n \n \n Jubilee Campaign aims to raise $125,000 by Aug. 14, in order to help 10 of the girls to \u201chave a fresh start and continue their education in a safe and nurturing environment.\u201d \n \n \n \n Along with providing an education to the young women, the fundraiser is a reminder \u201cthat the grand-scale of violence has not stopped in Chibok,\u201d she added. \n \n \n \n \u201cBoko Haram unleashed and continues to unleash a vicious cycle of attacks on villages, churches, and schools,\u201d she said, pointing to recent reports that 11 parents of the abducted girls have now died. \n \n \n \n Jubilee Campaign also hosted a \u201c100 Days of Captivity Rally\u201d on July 24, marking 100 days since the girls had been kidnapped and urging the Nigerian government to do everything in its power to find and return the girls. \n \n \n \n Ultimately, Norris said, the organization hopes to raise enough money to ensure the future of the escaped young women, and to be the light of Christ for them. \n \n \n \n \u201cIf we can get these girls back in school in a safe environment, then the Chibok people, the Chibok culture, and these girls will survive in spite of Boko Haram,\u201d she explained. \n \n \n \n Jubilee Campaign\u2019s fundraising website can be found at: http://www.youcaring.com/tuition-fundraiser/education-after-escape-1-month-10-girl-victims-125-000/206245 \n \n Tags: Women, Nigeria, Education, Boko Haram ||||| Recent U.S. surveillance flights over northeastern Nigeria showed what appeared to be large groups of girls held together in remote locations, raising hopes among domestic and foreign officials that they are among the group that Boko Haram abducted from a boarding school in April, U.S. and Nigerian officials said. \n \n The surveillance suggests that at least some of the 219 schoolgirls still held captive haven't been forced into marriage... ||||| The Education After Escape campaign reached a significant goal of over $20,000 in its one month campaign (July 18- August 18, 2014). Help us raise even more funds to educate the escaped schoolgirls who were abducted by Boko Haram in Nigeria by going to https://www.youcaring.com/nonprofits/education-after-escape/228007. \n \n \n \n \n \n As the world\u2019s attention turned to northern Nigeria and the demand for the return of the abducted Chibok schoolgirls, it is important to note that although these women and children may escape Boko Haram\u2019s clutches, they do not escape the long term effects of their capture. With the mass abductions of nearly 300 hundred Chibok girls, Boko Haram has had a chilling effect on girl education in northern Nigeria. Amazingly, some of the girls have managed to escape their vicious captors. \n \n In the midst of this atrocity, the education of Nigeria\u2019s girls has been disrupted and there is a real risk of having a lost generation, thereby risking the long-term peace and development in Nigeria and the wider region. Every girl deserves the right to an education! These rescued girls are living in constant fear of Boko Haram\u2019s further vengeance and need your help. \n \n Organizations like Jubilee Campaign USA are trying to make a difference. Jubilee Campaign, a US based non-profit organization with a track record of helping victims of violence in northern Nigeria, is assisting 10 of the girl child victims, who courageously escaped the confines of their Boko Haram captors, to send them to specialized boarding schools where their traumatic experiences may be transformed into empowering triumphs over evil. Each girl will be able to enroll in a school where she will grow in wisdom and stature while gaining mental and emotional support. Through this campaign, these girls who due to cost, environmental threats, or ongoing Boko Haram violence in Nigeria, would otherwise be out of school and thus their future potential and healing neglected, will have the opportunity to survive. \n \n The Education After Escape Campaign seeks to be the change. We are looking to mobilize $125,000 in 1 month (by the end of August 2014) to support the transportation and education of 10 escaped girl victims from Boko Haram terrorists, leading them to a hopeful and successful future through education. \n \n On behalf of the children that we help out, we thank you, so much. We have done this successfully with one girl from Chibok already. Now we want to do it for 10. \n \n \n \n \n \n So what are you waiting for? Donate now!

US surveillance planes have on at least two occasions spotted sizable groups of girls in remote locales in northeastern Nigeria. The girls had been moved by the time subsequent flights flew overhead, but the development suggests that instead of selling the girls into sex slavery as feared, Boko Haram is keeping them in the hopes of a prisoner swap with the government. In fact, the Journal quotes a Nigerian security adviser who says that Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau has given orders that \"anybody found touching any of the girls should be killed immediately.\" President Goodluck Jonathan has publicly ruled out a prisoner exchange, but he is up for re-election in February and under heavy pressure to bring the girls home.

    "document": "Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n BAGHDAD \u2014 Wielding the threat of sectarian slaughter, Sunni Islamist militants claimed on Sunday that they had massacred hundreds of captive Shiite members of Iraq\u2019s security forces, posting grisly pictures of a mass execution in Tikrit as evidence and warning of more killing to come. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The possible mass killing came as militants cemented control of the city of Tal Afar, west of Mosul, after two days of fierce clashes with Iraqi troops, residents and senior security officials said. The city came under mortar attack, sending many residents fleeing toward Sinjar to the west and Mosul to the east. Residents said the militants freed dozens of prisoners. \n \n Even as anecdotal reports of extrajudicial killings around the country seemed to bear out the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria\u2019s intent to kill Shiites wherever it could, Iraqi officials and some human rights groups cautioned that the militants\u2019 claim to have killed 1,700 soldiers in Tikrit could not be immediately verified. \n \n But with their claim, the Sunni militants were reveling in an atrocity that if confirmed would be the worst yet in the conflicts that roil the region, outstripping even the poison gas attack near Damascus last year. \n \n Photo \n \n In an atmosphere where there were already fears that the militants\u2019 sudden advance near the capital would prompt Shiite reprisal attacks against Sunni Arab civilians, the claims by ISIS were potentially explosive. And that is exactly the group\u2019s stated intent: to stoke a return to all-out sectarian warfare that would bolster its attempts to carve out a Sunni Islamist caliphate that crosses borders through the region. \n \n The sectarian element of the killings may put more pressure on the Obama administration to aid Iraq militarily. In fact, the militants seemed to be counting on it. A pronouncement on Sunday by the group\u2019s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, had a clear message for the United States: \u201cSoon we will face you, and we are waiting for this day.\u201d \n \n The group\u2019s announcement was made in a series of gruesome photographs uploaded to an ISIS Twitter feed and on websites late on Saturday night. Some showed insurgents, many wearing black masks, lining up at the edges of what looked like shallow mass graves and apparently firing their weapons into young men who had their hands bound behind their backs and were packed closely together in large groups. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The photographs showed what appeared to be seven massacre sites, although several of them may have been different views of the same sites. In any one of the pictures, no more than about 60 victims could be seen and sometimes as few as 20 at each of the sites, although it was not clear if the photographs showed the entire graves. \n \n The militants\u2019 captions seemed tailor-made to ignite anger and fear among Shiites. \u201cThe filthy Shiites are killed in the hundreds,\u201d one read. \u201cThe liquidation of the Shiites who ran away from their military bases,\u201d read another, and, \u201cThis is the destiny of Maliki\u2019s Shiites,\u201d referring to Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Many of the captions mocked the victims. In one photograph, showing a group of young men walking toward an apparent execution site, where armed masked men awaited, the caption read, \u201cLook at them walking to death on their own feet.\u201d \n \n So far, Iraq\u2019s majority Shiites were not rising to the bait. Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, their supreme religious leader, issued a statement on Saturday calling for all groups to \u201cexert the highest possible level of self-restraint during this tumultuous period.\u201d And there was little immediate public reaction to the ISIS claims in Baghdad or other southern Iraqi cities. \n \n A senior Iraqi government official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to make press statements, said news of the executions was slow to circulate because Twitter and other social media sites had been blocked for days. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt they are real, but 1,700 is a big number,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are trying to control the reaction.\u201d \n \n Acutely aware of the potential for retaliatory violence, some government officials who had heard about the ISIS claims took pains to play them down, confirming only that some executions had taken place in Tikrit, but not on a large scale. \n \n One Iraqi security official claimed that no more than 11 bodies of executed soldiers were recovered from the Tigris River downstream from the execution site, a group of six and a group of five, although he confirmed that 800 soldiers had been taken prisoner in the area. He also reported finding 17 bodies washed up against a dam near Samarra, another city the militants are fighting for. But he said, \u201cThere is no such superstitious number as 1,700 people executed.\u201d \n \n An official statement posted on the Ministry of Defense\u2019s website denied the executions had taken place at all. \n \n Still, other officials and human rights representatives, while cautioning that they could not confirm the full 1,700 number being claimed, said that ISIS had shown no compunctions against hunting Shiites. And they reiterated that such horrific claims would go to further the group\u2019s intent to sow chaos. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re trying to verify the pics, and I am not convinced they are authentic,\u201d said Erin Evers, the Human Rights Watch researcher in Iraq. \u201cAs far as ISIS claiming it has killed 1,700 people and publishing horrific photos to support that claim, it is unfortunately in keeping with their pattern of commission of atrocities, and obviously intended to further fuel sectarian war.\u201d \n \n Col. Suhail al-Samaraie, head of the Awakening Council in Samarra, a pro-government Sunni grouping, confirmed that officials in Salahuddin Province were aware that large-scale executions had taken place, but did not know how many. \u201cThey are targeting anyone working with the government side, any place, anywhere,\u201d he said. He said the insurgents were targeting both Sunnis and Shiites, anyone with a government affiliation, but claiming for propaganda reasons that the victims were all Shiites. \n \n A New York Times employee in Tikrit said local residents saw hundreds of Iraqi military personnel captured when they tried to flee Camp Speicher, a former American military base and airfield now used as an air force training center on the edge of Tikrit. It is still in government hands. \n \n Continue reading the main story Video \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Most of those captured were air force cadets, the employee said. Those who were Sunnis were given civilian clothes and sent home; the Shiites were marched and trucked off to the grounds of Saddam Hussein\u2019s old palace in Tikrit, where they reportedly were executed. He added that the bodies had been dumped in the Tigris River, which runs by the palace compound. \n \n The ISIS photographs appeared to have been taken at that location, the employee said. However, he said he had not spoken to any witnesses who claimed to have seen the executions or the victims\u2019 bodies. \n \n Ryan C. Crocker, a former ambassador to Iraq and a critic of America\u2019s 2011 withdrawal from that nation after the two countries failed to sign a mutual security pact, said the atrocity claims, proven or not, made it more urgent than ever for Washington to become involved. \n \n \u201cWhat this administration has to do is get John Kerry on a plane right now, like we did when I was there, and sit down with Shia, Sunni and Kurdish leaders and help them get to a position of declared national unity. Iraqis have to stand together now,\u201d Mr. Crocker said. Regarding the massacres, he said, \u201cWhatever it is, however many people, it\u2019s clearly an effort to ignite an Iraqi civil war.\u201d \n \n Political analysts here mostly agreed about the militants\u2019 intent. \u201cThe problem now is that you are dealing with emotions and ISIS is trying to provoke the other side to take revenge,\u201d said Ameer Jabbar al-Sa\u2019aedi, a Baghdad-based analyst. \u201cThere are extremists among the Shia, too, and if they respond, they could begin killing and not exclude anyone. It would be just like what happened in 2006.\u201d \n \n Even though Ayatollah Sistani\u2019s statement over the weekend was intended to call for restraint on the part of Shiites, it came after his call just a day before for every Iraqi to take up arms to support the government. \n \n That appeal was expected to greatly accelerate the formation of volunteer groups to supplement Shiite militias \u2014 nominally to fight alongside the Iraqi Army. But during the worst of the sectarian bloodletting in Iraq, from 2005 through 2007, some such Shiite groups were deeply involved in violence that was killing as many as 1,000 civilians each week. \n \n One militia leader, Abu Bakr al-Zubaidi, from a group called Asaib Al Haq, a hard-line offshoot of the Mahdi Army militia, said he was not surprised to hear of the executions. \n \n \u201cISIS regards Shia as their eternal enemy, and they will kill whoever falls in their hands who is Shia, whether they are soldiers, grocers or even singers,\u201d he said. \u201cOur response to that is there will not be any living ISIS prisoner.\u201d ||||| The aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush and two other U.S. Navy ships arrived in the Persian Gulf Sunday, as Iraqi troops mobilized to protect their country from a wave of Sunni insurgents taking over cities, and threatening the nation's capital. \n \n The USS George H.W. Bush \u2014 accompanied by the guided-missile cruiser USS Philippine Sea and the guided-missile destroyer USS Truxtun \u2014 was ordered to the Persian Gulf Saturday to protect American lives and interests in the region. \n \n Meanwhile the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) launched a raid on Tal Afar, a town near the Syrian border, according to security forces and a local official.

The air raids took place in Saqlawiyah, northwest of Fallujah, according to a graphic run by state TV. \n \n ISIS has been ruthlessly fighting to take control of Iraq and has apparently posted chilling photos on jihadi Internet forums seeming to show the executions of Iraqi security forces. \n \n CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the images purportedly posted by ISIS . CNN is examining the terrain in the images, some of the signage on buildings in several of the pictures and the uniforms of the apparent victims. Those details suggest the photos are real and were taken in Iraq. \n \n A caption on some of the images reads: \"apostates heading to their hole of doom.\" \n \n ISIS, an al Qaeda splinter group, wants to establish a caliphate, or Islamic state, that would stretch from Iraq into northern Syria. The group has had substantial success in Syria battling Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's security forces. \n \n On Friday, a tweet on what was claimed to be an ISIS Twitter account claimed that its members killed at least 1,700 Shiites.

While we cannot confirm these reports, one of the primary goals of ISIL is to set fear into the hearts of all Iraqis and drive sectarian division among its people,\" part of the statement read. \"Terrorists who can commit such heinous acts are a shared enemy of the United States, Iraq, and the international community. \" \n \n The militants' quick advance in Iraq has been helped by many Sunnis who feel that the Shiite-dominated government has marginalized them. \n \n ISIS seized Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul, last week and has threatened to march on Baghdad, Iraq's capital and largest city. \n \n But \"Mosul didn't fall,\" a defiant Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki told military leaders in Baghdad in a speech televised Sunday on state TV. \"The ones who have fallen are the politicians who have bet against Iraq.\" The Prime Minister said, \"We will not allow anyone to divide the Iraqi people.\" \n \n Al-Maliki called on his top brass and soldiers to march and fight against ISIS, while criticizing Iraqi politicians conspiring against their homeland and Iraqi soldiers who have refused to continue to fight when confronted by ISIS. \n \n \"We will march on every inch, with all our weapons, with all our will and faith, so we can liberate and cleanse every inch of Iraq -- from the southernmost point to the furthest point in the north,\" he exhorted the military leaders. \n \n Despite al-Maliki's bold statements, ISIS accumulated several victories across Iraq on Sunday. \n \n The northwest Iraqi city of Tal Afar fell to ISIS, according to Iraqi Gen. Mohammed al-Quraishi. Many Tal Afar residents -- ethnic minority Shiite Turkmen -- fled the fighting north toward Iraq's Kurdish region. Tal Afar is in Nineveh province, midway between the country's border with Syria and Mosul, north of Baghdad. \n \n Before Iraqi security forces lost Tal Afar, several mortar rounds landed on a busy area in the town and killed at least seven and wounded 33 people, security officials in Baghdad and Tal Afar told CNN. \n \n Also Sunday, ISIS gained control of two villages in Adhaim, in its first push into Diyala province, northeast of Baghdad. \n \n On top of that, Iraqi security forces and gunmen believed to be ISIS clashed near al-Khalis, about 18 miles from Diyala's capital, Baquba, al-Khalis police officials told CNN. Three mortar rounds landed near a recruitment center opened recently for volunteers to help the Iraqi army fight against ISIS. \n \n Baquba is about 37 miles northeast of Baghdad. Baquba is an ethnically-mixed city, though Sunnis represent a slight majority. \n \n Given Baquba's proximity to Baghdad, if Baquba were to fall, it could give ISIS militants three-pronged access to Baghdad -- from Anbar province to the west, Ninevah and Salahuddin provinces to the north and from Diyala province from the northeast. \n \n Meanwhile, on Sunday, CNN Senior International Correspondent Arwa Damon was in the Iraqi Kurdish province of Kirkuk, where last Thursday militants took control of two villages. \n \n She asked the local governor, Dr. Najmaldin Karim, whether the United States should launch airstrikes to help fight back ISIS. \n \n \"I think they know how to do it, but blanket bombing is not going to work here,\" Karim said, explaining that that approach ignores the fact that ISIS is too blended into the civilian population in Kirkuk and innocent people could die. But there should be targeted bombing in both Iraq and Syria, he said. \n \n \"I don't think anyone is safe from these people,\" said Karim. \n \n Partial staff relocation at U.S. Embassy \n \n Between 50 and 100 U.S. Marines and U.S. Army personnel have arrived at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, a U.S. official told CNN on Sunday. \n \n A U.S official acknowledged to CNN that the additional embassy security personnel being added include U.S. Marines who specialize in embassy protection during high-threat conditions. \n \n The U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003. American military forces ended their withdrawal from the country in December 2011. \n \n At the time of the U.S. drawdown, Iraq's leadership had agreed that a residual U.S. military presence was desirable, but the talks broke down over the prickly issue of legal immunity for U.S. troops in Iraq. \n \n The Obama administration had said any deal to keep U.S. troops in Iraq beyond the withdrawal deadline would require a guarantee of legal protection for American soldiers. But the Iraqis refused to agree to that, opening up the prospect of American troops being tried in Iraqi courts and subjected to Iraqi punishment. \n \n This week, President Barack Obama continued to consider options with regard to the situation in Iraq but ruled out sending troops into the country. \n \n On Sunday, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that some U.S. security personnel will be added to the staff at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and other staff members will be temporarily relocated to consular offices in Basra and Irbil and to the Iraq Support Unit in Amman, Jordan. \n \n A \"substantial majority of the U.S. Embassy presence in Iraq will remain in place,\" Psaki said in a statement, and \"the Embassy will be fully equipped to carry out its national security mission.\" \n \n Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said that a \"small number of Defense Department personnel\" are augmenting State Department security assets in Baghdad. Kirby said that the relocation of some embassy personnel is being done with commercial, charter and State Department aircraft flights. \n \n The U.S. military can airlift people if the State Department asks for that, Kirby said. \n \n The State Department is warning U.S. citizens against \"all but essential travel to Iraq.\" The official travel warning says U.S. citizens in Iraq \"remain at high risk for kidnapping and terrorist violence.\" \n \n While that continues, Iran has recently entered the fray, according to a senior security official in Baghdad who spoke to CNN on Friday. That official said that in recent days, Iran has sent about 500 Iranian Revolutionary Guard troops to fight alongside Iraqi government security forces in Iraq's Diyala province. \n \n However, Iranian officials, including President Hassan Rouhani , denied reports that some of its elite forces are in Iraq to help bolster al-Maliki, a fellow Shiite. \n \n \"If the Iraqi government wants us to help, we will consider it,\" Rouhani said, according to an English translation of his remarks Saturday in Farsi by state-run Press TV. \n \n But, he said, \"so far they have not asked specifically for help,\" and added that Iran could give strategic guidance if requested. \n \n The Obama administration is exploring possible direct talks with Iran over the deteriorating situation in Iraq, two senior U.S. officials tell CNN. \n \n Both officials ruled out any type of teaming up with Iran because the United States and Iran don't have a lot of common interests -- other than a stable Iraq. \n \n The United States is wary of furthering Iran's already considerable influence in Iraq. The Shiite Iranian regime is al-Malaki's closest ally in the region. Additionally the administration is concerned appearing to team up with Iran would both alienate Iraq's Sunni majority and worry Sunni allies of the United States in the region. \n \n The State Department statement said the United States \"will do its part to help Iraq move beyond this crisis,\" and a senior State Department officer told CNN that Kerry spoke to his counterparts from Jordan, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar to discuss the threat posed by ISIS. \n \n The administration has not yet determined what the mechanism would be for talking to Iran, the senior U.S. officials said. \n \n Ex-U.S. ambassador: Kerry should go to Iraq \n \n On Sunday U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham argued on CNN's \"State of the Union\" for more intervention in Iraq. \n \n The South Carolina Republican, a frequent critic of the Obama administration's approach to foreign policy, called Obama \"stubborn-headed,\" \"delusional\" and \"detached\" over his decision on how to react to the unfolding crisis. \n \n \"Time is running out to turn this around,\" Graham said. \"Get involved with air power. Stop the march toward Baghdad. Deal with Syria. But get a new government (in Iraq) in place as quickly as you can that will bring the Iraqis back together for a counteroffensive.\" \n \n Ryan Crocker, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq from 2007 to 2009, told CNN's Fareed Zakaria on Sunday that he thinks Secretary of State John Kerry should fly to Iraq immediately. \n \n \"We need the secretary of state out there in Baghdad right now,\" Crocker said. \"We need the President on the phone to the Iraqi leadership because the reality is the Iraqis are not in a position ... they were not in a position when I was there, they are not in a position now, to work out hard compromises on their own.\" \n \n The United States is the \"middleman among Sunni, Shia and Kurds,\" Crocker said. \"Ambassadors can go just so far.\" \n \n Crocker, now the dean of the George Bush School of Government & Public Service at Texas A&M University, said he would support \"very carefully targeted airstrikes\" in conjuction with high-level diplomacy. \n \n \"We have got to help the Iraqis come together,\" Crocker urged, \"in a unified fashion to confront a common threat.\" ||||| Whatever the United States or Iran does in response to the Iraqi crisis, there are wider international considerations at stake. Washington Institute Senior Fellow Michael Eisenstadt joins WSJ's Michael Casey on the News Hub to discuss.

It also comes as the U.S. and other world powers try to reach an agreement with Iran by late July to curb its nuclear program. \n \n Sunni militants have captured the key northern Iraqi town of Tal Afar, adding to the vast area of territory that Iraq's government lost to insurgents last week. WSJ's Robert Ourlian joins Michael Casey on the News Hub with exclusive details.

More quote details and news \u00bb TWTR in Your Value Your Change Short position account associated with ISIS claiming to show Sunni militants carrying out a mass execution of captured Iraqi Shiite soldiers, raising the prospect of a broader sectarian war in Iraq. \n \n The photographs, accompanied by captions boasting that as many as 1,700 soldiers had been executed, underscored the mounting sectarian animosity fueling the fighting between Sunni extremists and Mr. Maliki's Shiite-dominated government. \n \n The photographs appear to show dozens of men in civilian clothes in captivity. Captions on the photos describe say the men were being taken away to their deaths. \n \n In one image, men are shown being transported in trucks. Another image shows armed men wearing black ISIS bandanas pointing their guns toward a clutch of men lying face down in ditch. Still another shows the same men with bloody wounds to their heads. \n \n If the claim of carrying out mass executions in Iraq is true, pressure could increase on Shiites to retaliate, raising the prospect of a wave of reprisal killings reminiscent of the bloodshed that convulsed Iraq in the years following the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. \n \n While the photographs were posted on a Twitter account associated with ISIS, neither the alleged death toll nor the identity of the purported victims could be verified independently. \n \n As the U.S. and Iran prepare for talks on the declining situation in Iraq, experts say that Washington should not engage with terrorist organizations. The WSJ's Deborah Kan speaks to Jonathan Schanzer, vice president for research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \n \n But Ahmed Abdullah Al Jibouri, the governor of Salah Al Din province, where the mass atrocity supposedly took place, said that ISIS had captured \"hundreds\" of Iraqi military personnel and Air Force Academy students and is believed to have executed them. \n \n Mr. Jibouri said that the exact number of dead was unknown, since government officials have been unable to reach the alleged sites of the massacre. \n \n In Washington, State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki said the U.S. couldn't confirm reports of the massacres but called the claim by ISIS \"horrifying and a true depiction of the blood lust that these terrorists represent.\" \n \n U.S. officials said it is imperative for Washington to discuss the security situation in Iraq with Iran and other regional powers in a bid to better coordinate a response against ISIS. \n \n Secretary of State John Kerry communicated Washington's strategy to his Iraqi counterpart, Hoshyar Zebari, in a phone call on Saturday, according to the State Department. \n \n Iranian President Hasan Rouhani said on Saturday that his government was open to cooperating with the U.S. in Iraq and that he exchanged letters with President Obama. \n \n \"When the U.S. takes action, then one can think about cooperation,\" Mr. Rouhani said at a news conference in Tehran. \"Until today, no specific request for help has been demanded. But we are ready to help within international law.\" \n \n The U.S. officials said it wasn't certain yet which diplomatic channel the Obama administration would use to discuss the Iraq situation. \n \n The Islamic militant group that seized much of northern Iraq posted photos that appear to show its fighters executing captured Iraqi soldiers. Associated Press \n \n One avenue could be through Vienna, where senior American and Iranian diplomats will convene starting Monday as part of international negotiations aimed at reaching a comprehensive agreement to curb Tehran's nuclear capabilities. \n \n Iran's chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Mohammad Zarif, served as a key interlocutor between Iran and the George W. Bush administration after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, said U.S. officials. \n \n Both countries at the time sought to remove the Taliban, a Sunni extremist group, from power in Afghanistan and install President Hamid Karzai. \n \n \"Whatever dialogue may or may not be taking place [with Iran] would take place on the sideline or outside the mainstream of the nuclear talks\" in Vienna, Mr. Kerry said Saturday in London. \"We don't want that linked and mixed.\" \n \n American and Iranian officials over the past year have used a series of bilateral channels\u2014many in secret\u2014to discuss the nuclear issue. Last week, senior White House and State Department officials met their Iranian counterparts in Geneva but didn't discuss the Iraq crisis, according to U.S. officials. \n \n Related Video \n \n The U.S. and Iran rarely see each other as allies. However with new uprisings in Iraq threatening the Shiite led government, installed previously by the United States, both see a reason to work together. Photo: Associated Press \n \n The White House's engagement with Iran on Iraq offers both opportunities and risks, said U.S. defense officials and Arab diplomats. \n \n Iran, a majority Shiite country, has served as Mr. Maliki's closest Mideast ally and has mobilized Tehran's military and religious establishment to support their coreligionists in Iraq in recent days. Iran's elite military unit, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, has an extensive presence inside Iraq, said U.S. officials, and has trained Shiite militias that have joined the Iraqi army in fighting ISIS. \n \n U.S. officials say the IRGC trained many of the largest Shiite militias going back to the Iraq war and maintain contacts. These include the Mahdi Army, Kata'ib Hezbollah, and Asab Ahl al-Haq. \n \n Iran has publicly denied sending forces to fight in Iraq and has said it would give Iran military assistance if Iraq asked. \n \n Even some of Mr. Obama's harshest critics in Washington voiced support on Sunday for coordinating the U.S.'s military response in Iraq with Tehran's. They argued that ISIS poses a much greater near-term threat to the U.S.'s national-security interests than does Iran. \n \n \"Why did we deal with Stalin? Because he was not as bad as Hitler,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) said Sunday on CNN. \"The Iranians can provide some assets to make sure Baghdad doesn't fall.\" \n \n A number of U.S. defense officials, however, said Iran has a drastically different vision for Iraq than does the U.S. The Iranian government has also supported Mr. Maliki's policies of marginalizing Iraq's minority Sunni population politically and economically, which has fueled support for the ISIS's military operations in the Sunni regions of Iraq. \n \n Any U.S. military campaign in Iraq that is seen as allied with Iran's and the Shiite majority's risks further polarizing the country, said these officials. It could also alienate Washington's allies in Sunni-dominated countries like Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Jordan. \n \n \"This is a case where the enemy of our enemy is still our enemy,\" said a U.S. defense official who has worked extensively in Iraq. \"Any shared interests in Iraq are limited.\" \n \n U.S. allies in Israel and the Middle East are also concerned that any cooperation between Washington and Tehran on Iraq could complicate the nuclear negotiations. \n \n The Obama administration and its diplomatic partners in the United Nations Security Council have set a July 20 deadline to reach an agreement limiting Iran's nuclear capabilities. \n \n But U.S. and European diplomats have warned that the gaps between Washington's and Tehran's negotiating positions remain wide, raising serious doubts that an agreement can be reached by July. \n \n Mr. Rouhani took a hard-line position on the nuclear issue during his Saturday news conference. He said Tehran wouldn't significantly reduce its capacity to produce nuclear fuel through the enrichment of uranium\u2014a key Western demand. And he argued that the U.S.'s sanctions against Iran over the nuclear issue are starting to fray. \n \n \"During the nuclear negotiations we have displayed our strong commitment to diplomacy,\" Mr. Rouhani said. \"If a deal can't be reached by July 20, conditions will never be like the past. The sanctions regime has been broken.\" \n \n Israeli and Arab officials have voiced concern that the U.S. won't be able to maintain a tough line on the nuclear issue if its cooperating with Tehran in Iraq. Senior administration officials have denied this. \n \n In Iranian political circles, momentum is building about the prospect of Iran cooperating with the U.S. to contain the threat of al Qaeda reaching Iran's borders, said several Iranian diplomats and politicians. \n \n \"Some of us realize that is the best opportunity for Iran to improve its diplomatic relations with the U.S.,\" said a prominent politician in Tehran close to the government. \n \n During the Iraq war, the two sides occasionally discussed security interests, but through intermediaries such as Kurds. \n \n The current diplomatic climate may be ripe for Iran to openly engage with the U.S. and use it as an opening for normalizing relations. \n \n A key factor is that the taboo of direct dialogue with the Americans was broken when Messrs. Obama and Rouhani spoke on the phone during the U.N. General Assembly in New York last fall. Senior American and Iranian diplomats have an open communication channel under the umbrella of the continuing nuclear negotiations between Iran and world powers. \n \n The intelligence data gathered by Iran's elite Quds Force, the overseas branch of the IRGC present in both Syria and Iraq, would be valuable to the U.S. if it chose to take action against ISIS. \n \n \"Iran and the U.S. are the only two countries with the power to end Iraq's crisis in a peaceful way,\" tweeted Hamid Aboutalebi, a top political adviser of Mr. Rouhani, on Sunday. \n \n For Iran, the incentive to cooperate with the U.S. on Iraq goes further than just a desire to improve relations with the U.S., many observers say. ISIS is one of the biggest security threats Iran has faced since the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003, establishing military bases across the Islamic Republic's borders. \n \n \"Iran is definitely willing to cooperate with the U.S. over Iraq because the threat it's facing is one of existential national security,\" said Saeed Leylaz, a political analyst close to the government, in a phone interview from Tehran. \n \n \u2014Farnaz Fassihi, Ellen Knickmeyer and Dion Nissenbaum contributed to this article. \n \n Write to Jay Solomon at jay.solomon@wsj.com, Carol E.

Maliki has vowed to rout the insurgents. \n \n But Sunday's fighting in Tal Afar, a majority Turkomen town which is home to both Shi'ites and Sunnis, showed how volatile the deepening sectarian divisions have become. \n \n Residents in Sunni districts accused Shi'ite police and army forces of launching mortar fire at their neighbourhoods, prompting ISIL forces stationed outside the town to move in. \n \n \"The situation is disastrous in Tal Afar. There is crazy fighting and most families are trapped inside houses, they can\u2019t leave town,\" a local official said. \"If the fighting continues, a mass killing among civilians could result.\" \n \n Government forces are using helicopter gunships against ISIL on the outskirts of Tal Afar, a member of Maliki's security committee told Reuters. \n \n Over Mosul, an Iraqi military jet came under anti-aircraft fire from ISIL fighters, witnesses said. It was not immediately clear whether it was preparing to attack ISIL positions or was carrying out reconnaissance. \n \n BAGHDAD BOMB \n \n In Baghdad on Sunday, a suicide attacker detonated explosives in a vest he was wearing, killing at least nine people and wounding 20 in a crowded street in the centre of the capital, police and medical sources said. \n \n At least six people were killed, including three soldiers and three volunteers, when four mortars landed at a recruiting centre in Khlais, 50 km (30 miles) north of Baghdad. \n \n Volunteers were gathered by army to join fighting to regain control of the northern town of Udhaim from ISIL militants. \n \n They were some of the thousands who responded to a call by the country's most influential Shi'ite cleric to take up arms and defend the country against the hardline insurgents, many of whom consider Shi'ites as heretics. \n \n A series of pictures distributed on a purported ISIL Twitter account appeared to show gunmen from the Islamist group shooting dozens of men, unarmed and lying prone on the ground. \n \n Captions accompanying the pictures said they showed hundreds of army deserters who were captured as they tried to flee the fighting. They were shown being transported in the back of truck and led to an open field where they laid down in rows and shot by several masked gunmen. In several pictures, the black Islamist ISIL flag can be seen. \n \n Most of the captured men were wearing civilian clothes, although one picture showed two men in military camouflage trousers, one of them half covered by a pair of ordinary trousers. \n \n \"This is the fate of the Shi'ites which Nuri brought to fight the Sunnis,\" a caption to one of the pictures reads. Others showed ISIL fighters apparently seizing facilities in Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's hometown. \n \n It was not immediately possible to verify the authenticity of the pictures. \n \n Across the border, a Syrian government air raid hit near ISIL's headquarters in the eastern city of Raqqa, activists said. \n \n Raqqa, the first and only Syrian city to fall to insurgents since Syria's conflict began more than three years ago, has been a major base for ISIL since it evicted rival rebels including al Qaeda's Syrian affiliate during infighting this year. \n \n The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said warplanes targeted the governorate building, a large structure in the centre of town, as well as two other buildings, including a sharia, or Islamic law, court. \n \n Images posted by ISIL supporters online showed a hole surrounded by rubble in the pavement outside the governorate building, although the date and authenticity could not be verified. It was unclear if the building itself was damaged. \n \n There were no immediate reports of casualties. \n \n While expressing support for Iraq's government, the United States has stressed the need for a political solution to a crisis threatening to fracture the country less than three years after the U.S. military withdrawal. \n \n Secretary of State John Kerry told Iraq's foreign minister in a call on Saturday that U.S. assistance would only succeed if Iraqi leaders set aside their differences and forged the national unity needed to confront the insurgent threat. \n \n The United States ordered an aircraft carrier moved into the Gulf on Saturday, readying it in case Washington decides to pursue a military option after insurgents overran areas in the north and advanced on Baghdad. \n \n Oil prices have risen to the highest level this year over fears of the violence disrupting exports from OPEC member Iraq. \n \n Arab League Secretary General Nabil Elaraby said Arab foreign ministers will discuss the \"dangerous situation in Iraq\" at a meeting in the Saudi city of Jeddah in the next two days. \n \n In Cairo, a meeting of Arab League ambassadors condemned the \"terrorist danger\" facing Iraq but did not discuss military assistance. \n \n (Additional reporting by Isabel Coles and David Sheppard in Arbil, Raheem Salman in Baghdad and Alexander Dziadosz in Beirut; Editing by Giles Elgood) ||||| Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Insurgents set off two bombs in separate incidents in central Baghdad on Sunday, killing as many as 21 people, witnesses said, and breaking a recent although brief lull in attacks in Iraq\u2019s capital city. \n \n One attack targeted a market near the Green Zone that sells new and used military uniforms. At the time of the bombing the market was crowded with volunteers seeking to join the fight against insurgents who have swept through much of northern Iraq in the past week. Witnesses at the scene, in the Al-Bab Al-Sharqi area close to Tahrir Square, said 15 people were killed and eight wounded in the midday attack by a suicide bomber wearing a vest full of explosives. Officials put the death toll at nine. \n \n \u201cI picked up the head of the suicide attacker by my own hands,\u201d said Ahmed Al-Fatlawi, 33, who sells clothes and who said two of his friends were killed in the attack. \u201cHe was a youth with a big beard.\u201d \n \n Earlier, about 7 a.m. Sunday, a car bomb exploded at a bus station in southern Baghdad\u2019s Bab al-Sheikh neighborhood, killing 12 people and injuring 30, according to a security official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to do so publicly. \n \n The last major suicide attack was on Wednesday, when 21 people were killed in the largely Shiite Sadr City neighborhood. On June 7, a spate of attacks throughout Shiite neighborhoods in Baghdad killed at least 48 people.",

    "document": "In The Event Of A Nuclear Blast, Don't Condition Your Hair \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Smith Collection/Getty Images Smith Collection/Getty Images \n \n If, for some reason, you find yourself in a situation where you need to wash radioactive material from your body, don't reach for the bottle of hair conditioner. Conditioner can bind radioactive particles to your hair. \n \n That warning was part of guidelines issued last Friday by Guam's Office of Civil Defense, following threats from North Korea that it was preparing to test a missile that would create an \"enveloping fire\" around the U.S. territory. On Tuesday, North Korean state media reported it would not carry out the test after all. \n \n Still, the guidelines, which also include information on how to take cover before an explosion, are correct. They're the same guidelines posted on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's website, Ready.gov. \n \n The reason conditioner can be dangerous has to do with the physical characteristics of human hair, the chemistry of hair conditioner and properties of nuclear fallout. \n \n When a nuclear warhead detonates, a fireball incinerates everything it touches and hurls the vaporized material skyward. Buildings, rock and living things are turned to dust and get mixed up with the radioactive byproducts of uranium or plutonium atoms splitting. \n \n This dust, called nuclear fallout, leaks a steady stream of dangerous radiation. If you're unlucky enough to be caught outside during or after an explosion, fallout can settle onto your clothing and skin. \n \n Some of these particles are so small they can slip into crevices that lie open on strands of human hair. If you look at a strand of hair in a high-powered microscope, you'll see proteins that look like overlapping scales. \n \n \"It can come apart during the day like a pine cone,\" says Andrew Karam, a radiation safety expert who consults for government response teams. \"Radiation contamination particles can get between those scales.\" \n \n If you shower carefully with soap and shampoo, Karam says, the radioactive dust should wash right out. But hair conditioner has particular compounds called cationic surfactants and polymers. If radioactive particles have drifted underneath damaged scales of hair protein, these compounds can pull those scales down to create a smooth strand of hair. \"That can trap particles of contamination inside of the scale,\" Karam says. \n \n These conditioner compounds are also oily and have a positive charge on one end that will make them stick to negatively charged sections of a strand of hair, says Perry Romanowski, a cosmetics chemist who has developed personal hygiene formulas and now hosts \"The Beauty Brains\" podcast on cosmetics chemistry. \n \n \"Unlike shampoo, conditioners are meant to stay behind on your hair,\" Romanowski says. If the conditioner comes into contact with radioactive material, these sticky, oily compounds can gum radioactive dust into your hair, he says. \n \n For that matter, Romanowski says in the event of a nuclear blast, you might want to consider forgoing most personal care products that are sticky or oily. \"Skin lotions or moisturizing lotions or color cosmetics that have oils \u2014 these go on your skin and can attract dust or radiation particles from the air. So that would be a concern,\" he says. \n \n It's hard to know exactly how damaging using hair conditioner following a nuclear disaster would be, Karam says. But he says that a basic principle is to do anything you reasonably can to lower your radiation exposure. \"It's a very minor thing to give up using conditioner for a couple of days. Just wash with shampoo until the radioactivity is washed out,\" he says. \n \n Karam, who served with the U.S. Navy as a chemistry safety control officer aboard the attack submarine USS Plunger in the 1980s, says that regular washes with a simple soap or detergent should be enough. \n \n \"I got a lot of skin contamination on the sub. Most of the time, I could clean it up with soap and water in five to 10 minutes. We assumed two to three washes would take care of it,\" he says. \"Radioactivity is like changing a diaper. You don't want it on you, but if you do get it on you, just wash it off and go on with your day.\" \n \n The most important thing to remember when it comes to radioactive fallout is to try not to get exposed at all, Karam says. Radioactivity is dangerous and lethal at high doses. How much radiation you receive depends on a lot of factors, including how far away from the blast site you are, and whether or not you're in the path of the wandering plume of radioactive ash and dust from the explosion. \n \n A fallout shelter is best, but a basement may do in a pinch, Karam says. \"If you see a flash, go inside right away,\" he says. It could save your life. ||||| Like most people confronted with the possibility that a nuclear weapon or dirty bomb could release radioactive fallout somewhere near me, I've become obsessed with how to best wash my hair after such a disaster. Escalating rhetoric between the US president and North Korea has caused many people to wonder how they could survive a nuclear blast. In the event of the unthinkable, knowing a bit about haircare could prove useful. \n \n The federal government\u2019s Ready.gov Nuclear Blast web page recommends that if you\u2019re exposed to nuclear fallout, you should remove your outer clothes, then take a decontamination shower to wash your skin with soap and your hair with shampoo or soap and water \u2014 not, I repeat, not conditioner. It explains, \u201cDo not use conditioner in your hair because it will bind radioactive material to your hair, keeping it from rinsing out easily.\u201d It\u2019s rare that the government makes haircare recommendations, so I needed to find out more. \n \n I imagined post-blast radiation to function like an unholy ghost, but invisible radiation isn\u2019t the biggest concern. Nuclear fallout is actual, visible stuff: It\u2019s \u201ca fine dust or sand-like material\u201d that emits radiation \u2014 you need to get that off and take deep cover while it\u2019s blowing around and burning through its wild, destructive infancy and adolescence. \n \n After removing your outerwear, the next order of business is a decontamination shower. If a nuclear bomb or a dirty bomb goes off and you survive, experts say that you can easily shed 85-95 percent of the radiation on your body just through the removal of outer clothing and a decontamination shower. Yes, water from pipes will probably contain some radiation, but unless a specific warning is issued, use it for washing up anyway. This isn\u2019t the time to blow bottled water on washing your face. Put down the micellar water, dry shampoo, and cleansing wipes and get in a real shower, unless you can\u2019t reach one or getting wet means risking hypothermia. \n \n You can shed 85-95 percent of the radiation on your body just through the removal of outer clothing and a decontamination shower. \n \n While my first instinct would be to take a scalding hot shower and scrub down every inch of my body like a surgeon washing up before entering the operating room, that\u2019s not recommended. After exposure to radiation, new skin nicks, cuts, and irritation caused by cleansing or shaving should be avoided. My old colleague Ran Zwigenberg, assistant professor of Asian studies, history, and Jewish studies at Pennsylvania State University (he\u2019s the author of Hiroshima: The Origins of Global Memory Culture), said that the Japanese government recommended that people cut their hair after the Fukushima accident because it was believed to contain a large amount of radiation. But in most cases, it\u2019s safer to just shampoo your hair rather than crop or shave it. \n \n If you\u2019ve ever compared shampoo and conditioner ingredient lists, you know that there\u2019s sometimes overlap between what\u2019s in each bottle. While the Ready.gov recommendations just mention avoiding hair conditioner, research on decontamination advises that one should use a mild shampoo, and it warns against protein-based conditioners and shampoos for decontamination showers. Another earlier article warns against using protein-based shampoos with conditioners in them. Yet another article simply advises one to avoid conditioner and shampoos that contain conditioner. \n \n To find out why conditioner is a problem, I talked to cosmetic chemist Perry Romanowski, who specializes in haircare and serves as a host of the Beauty Brains podcast. He confirmed via email that conditioners are a problem for decontamination showers because \u201c[c]onditioners are meant to stay behind on the hair whereas shampoos are meant to be washed away.\u201d Ingredients such as \u201cCationic Surfactants (like cetrimonium chloride), silicone (like Dimethicone), and cationic polymers (like Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride)\u201d remain on the hair and can bind radiation to the strands. \n \n Why not just tell people to wash their hair with bar soap while decontaminating? \n \n The good news is that it\u2019s okay to use things like hair conditioner and your favorite shampoo during your next shower, post-decontamination, according to Thomas F. O'Connell, an expert in radiation safety and the Health Physics Society\u2019s homeland security and security screening editor. In fact, things like skincare for your face and body lotion are fine once you\u2019re done decontaminating. \n \n After learning about post-nuclear haircare, I was left wondering why conditioner warnings were emphasized in government recommendations, but shaving, which could result in cuts that weaken the skin barrier, was not. Hair is a great nest for stuff, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve discovered if you\u2019ve painted a ceiling or walked under some asshole birds while on the way to an important meeting. But why not just tell people to wash their hair with bar soap while decontaminating, as the USSR did, and make this real simple and safe? \n \n Since I started researching for this article, the page that warns people not to use conditioner on their hair after a nuclear blast has gone from standard text with a zoomed-out blast thumbnail to something resembling a MySpace homepage for a death metal band. The new presidential administration doesn\u2019t have time for appointing government officials that would actually track down and dispose of stray nuclear material that could be fashioned into dirty bombs, but there\u2019s always time for setting stock mushroom clouds as webpage backgrounds. Said cloud appears to be a Getty image used frequently around the web on apocalyptic articles such \u201cWe All May Be Dead in 2050,\u201d and there\u2019s a wolf face in there if you look at it after reaching caffeine saturation. \n \n Wary of the bureaucracy, I filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to determine how the government came to the conclusion that nuclear blast warnings should mention hair conditioner. Shortly after filing my request, FEMA let me know that the information had come from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). I filed a FOIA with the CDC, but the agency closed the request and said that its information came from a fairly obscure report. \n \n If you actually view the report, you\u2019ll discover that the only section that mentions conditioner is credited to an earlier handbook, published in 2006. Had I not confirmed with outside experts, I don't know how I\u2019d feel about getting my current disaster advice from people from 2006 who put emergency service vehicle cartoon clip art in radiation warning symbols \u2014 something about this doesn't feel very well thought-out. \n \n A report I found on the CDC\u2019s website called \u201cDetonation of an Improvised Nuclear Device\u201d details how the CDC and FEMA, in partnership with Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), tested media messages about what to do after the detonation of an improvised nuclear device (aka a dirty bomb, the kind meant to spread fallout and panic). \n \n \u201cIn February 2011, six 90-minute focus groups were conducted\u201d at market research facilities \u201cto explore the relevance, comprehensibility, credibility, and effectiveness of selected messages\u201d about what to do after the detonation of a dirty bomb. The focus groups responded positively to the advisement about hair conditioner and overall said that the messages helped them realize that dirty bombs are survivable, and that the advisements would help them feel calm in the event of an emergency. \n \n While not perfect, the Ready.gov recommendations on your post-disaster haircare routine have been made after far more planning and deliberation than the recent statements that could lead to that haircare routine becoming a necessity. ||||| Last week, when North Korea was threatening to send a ballistic missile toward the U.S. territory of Guam, the island's inhabitants were warned that in the case of a nuclear attack, they should not condition their hair. \n \n Wait, what? \n \n Hair conditioning might seem like the last thing that would be on a person's mind following a nuclear attack, but this hair care advice has scientific merit: Conditioner can \"bind radioactive material to your hair,\" according to guidelines posted by Guam's Office of Civil Defense Friday (Aug. 11). [Doom and Gloom: Top 10 Post-Apocalyptic Worlds] \n \n It appears that the people of Guam are safe for the moment, however. North Korea has since de-escalated its threat, saying it would \"wait a little more\" before moving forward with the missile launchings, according to The New York Times. \n \n Even so, the conditioner recommendations stand. During a nuclear attack, a fireball would pulverize everything in its path, launching the resulting vaporized material upward and mixing it with radioactive byproducts from the bomb to create a radioactive dust, according to NPR. This dust is known as nuclear fallout, and it can contaminate everything it falls on, including human hair. \n \n If people survive the blast, they should take off their outer layer of clothing, which can remove up to 90 percent of radioactive material, according to Ready.gov, a U.S. site on disaster preparedness. If water is available for bathing, survivors should also shower with soap and shampoo to wash off any radioactive dust. \n \n But because hair is made of overlapping scales, it's a bad idea to condition it in the aftermath of a nuclear attack. \n \n \"[Hair] can come apart during the day like a pinecone,\" Andrew Karam, a radiation safety expert who consults for government response teams, told NPR. \"Radiation contamination particles can get between those scales.\" \n \n Unlike shampoo, conditioner has certain compounds \u2014 mainly cationic surfactants (such as cetrimonium chloride), silicone (like dimethicone) and cationic polymers (such as guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride) \u2014 that pull down these scales to smooth a person's hair, Perry Romanowski, a cosmetic chemist who hosts The Beauty Brains podcast, told Racked. \n \n If nuclear fallout gets under these scales, when the scales are smoothed down, radioactive particles can be trapped underneath and remain there, Karam told NPR. \n \n In addition, conditioner has sticky, oily compounds that stay in hair, even after it's rinsed. These compounds could make it easier for nuclear fallout to stick to the hair, which could, in turn, increase a person's risk of radioactive exposure, Romanowski told NPR. \n \n In fact, people should avoid applying to their body any oily or sticky cosmetic product, such as skin lotion or color cosmetics, if they're in a nuclear fallout zone, as these products would also amass radioactive dust, Romanowski said. \n \n However, most injuries from a nuclear bomb are caused by pressure from the explosion, as well as fires, collapsed buildings, flying shrapnel and acute radiation poisoning (the kind that happens from the initial explosion rather than long-term exposure like that coming from your hair), Live Science reported previously. \n \n Original article on Live Science.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It might be the strangest advice imaginable for survivors of a nuclear attack: Don't use hair conditioner. But it turns out to be sound advice as well, reports Live Science. The matter came up when Guam, under threat of an attack by North Korea, recently issued safety guidelines to the public. And there among the usual seek-shelter nuggets was the warning that people should use soap and water to rid themselves of toxic dust but avoid the conditioner. It's all because of how the stuff works, and the upshot it that it could actually cause radioactive particles to bind to your hair. Hair is shaped almost like scales, which can open up and come apart throughout the day. Conditioner uses compounds like silicone and cationic polymers to pull these scales back down and smooth it, one cosmetic chemist tells Racked. Conditioner is also oily, and any oily products like lotions or cosmetics are likely to encourage fallout to stick around. So there you have it: Wash with soap and shampoo, but let your hair frizz out. NPR also took a look at those safety guidelines and highlights one that would come in handy should doomsday arrive: If you see a flash, get inside anywhere as fast as you can to reduce exposure to fallout, and remove your outer layer of clothing. (Dandruff shampoo could be harming our water.)",

The best thing to do is to try not to get exposed at all, an expert says. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has guidelines on how to take cover in case of an explosion, including sheltering in place and taking cover before an explosion. The most important thing to remember is to stay away from the plume of radioactive ash and dust from the explosion, and to take shelter as soon as possible, the agency says.\"It's a very minor thing to give up using conditioner for a couple of days,\" says radiation expert Andrew Karam.",

They never should have trapped him in and recycled him in [to Iraq]. Never. Not that mess of a child I saw with my own two eyes.

According to eyewitnesses, the security was so lax that many of the 300 soldiers on the base had access to the computer room where Manning worked, and passwords to access the intelligence computers were stuck on \"sticky notes\" on the laptop screens. \n \n Rank and file soldiers would watch grisly \"kill mission\" footage as a kind of entertainment on computers with access to the sensitive network of US diplomatic and military communications known as SIPRNet. \n \n Jacob Sullivan, 28, of Phoenix, Arizona, a former chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear specialist, was stationed at FOB Hammer in Manning's unit. \n \n \"A lot of different people worked from that building and in pretty much every room there was a SIPRNet computer attached to a private soldier or a specialist,\" Sullivan said \n \n \"On the computers that I saw there was a [sticky label] either on the computer or next to the computer with the information to log on. I was never given permission to log on so I never used it but there were a lot of people who did.\" \n \n He added: \"If you saw a laptop with a red wire coming out of it, you knew it was a SIPRNet. I would be there by myself and the laptops [would] be sitting there with passwords. Everyone would write their passwords down on sticky notes and set it by their computer.

    "document": "Curious what people are up to when it comes to sex? \n \n For some of us, not much, according to a new report issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics which painstakingly details the country\u2019s sexual habits. \n \n Based on in-person interviews with approximately 13,500 men and women between the ages of 15 to 44, the report describes who\u2019s having sex with whom, what kind of sex they\u2019re having, and who has yet to become sexually involved. \n \n Yes, virginity is apparently making a comeback. \n \n Researchers found that between 2006 and 2008, the percentage of 15- to 24-year-old men who had never had any form of sexual contact with another person was 27 percent (up from 22 percent in 2002) while the percentage of 15- to 24-year-old females who had never had any sex whatsoever was 29 percent (up 7 percent points from 22 percent in 2002). \n \n Anjani Chandra, a health scientist at the NCHS and lead author of the study, says 15- to 19-year-olds made up the lion\u2019s share of this category, a finding that seems to counter other reports regarding teen sex trends. \n \n \u201cI think a lot of people misconstrue this as meaning they\u2019ve never had vaginal sex,\u201d she says. \u201cBut this is no sexual contact of any kind. They didn\u2019t have oral sex or anal sex. They didn\u2019t have anything.\u201d \n \n Chandra says she couldn\u2019t speculate as to why there appears to be more virgins in our midst, but said it could be due to sex education, messages about abstinence or that it might hinge on the truthfulness of the respondents. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s what they\u2019re telling us and we have to take it on faith,\u201d she says. \n \n Women more likely to have same-sex experiences \n \n Further data collected from the survey, which asked men and women about their sexual behavior, sexual attraction and sexual identity, found that among adults aged 25 to 44, about 98 percent of females and 97 percent of males have had vaginal intercourse; 89 percent of females and 90 percent of men have had oral sex with an opposite-sex partner; and 36 percent of females and 44 percent of males have had anal sex with an opposite-sex partner. \n \n The survey also found that women aged 15 to 44 were more than twice as likely to have had a same-sex experience as men of the same age (in 2006-2008, approximately 12.5 percent of women reported a same-sex experience compared with 5.2 percent of men). \n \n Other data showed that women with four or more sexual partners in their lifetime were more likely to have had a female sexual partner, compared with women who had had no male partners or women who\u2019ve had only one male partner. While the percentage of men and women who reported they were either straight or homosexual was similar, the percentage of women who reported they were bisexual was more than three times as high as men. \n \n Chandra says one of the things that stood out for her in the report was the same-sex reporting for women. \n \n \u201cThere was speculation that it was possibly just experimentation among college girls but we didn\u2019t see anything to support that,\u201d she says. \u201cWe saw the opposite. When we look at college-degreed women, they were less likely to report same-sex activity than other educational groups. Among men, there\u2019s more same-sex activity among higher-educated men. And for women, the highest level of same-sex activity was reported by those with less education.\u201d \n \n Sexual categories more fluid than thought? \n \n According to Chandra, data from the survey \u2014 which tapped a general household population and did not include high-risk groups such as the homeless or incarcerated \u2014 will be used to provide better education and STD prevention efforts. But she says the data is also essential in order to better understand people\u2019s sexual activities and proclivities. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s important to realize there are not separate groups of sexual people,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can\u2019t just think \u2018Here are the heterosexual people; here are the homosexual people.\u2019 People draw their partners from all different places. There are not necessarily clear boundaries between the population groups that engage in this behavior or that behavior.\u201d \n \n Survey data was collected in person by about 40 female interviewers who met one-on-one with participants. Using a laptop, participants would see the question on the screen or listen to a question through a set of headphones. They would then type their answer directly onto the computer, a method that, according to the report, \u201chas been found to yield more complete reporting of sensitive behaviors.\u201d \n \n The audio for the interview questions \u2013 many of them quite explicit (i.e., \u201cHas a male ever put his penis in your rectum or butt \u2014 also known as anal sex?\u201d) \u2014 was recorded by a female employee of the University of Michigan. \n \n \u201cWe are considering whether we should use a computer-generated voice for future surveys, though,\u201d says Chandra. \u201cOr we might try out ways where a respondent could choose different voices.\u201d ||||| Among the findings of a sweeping federal government survey of American sexual behavior is one that may surprise those bewailing a permissive and eros-soaked popular culture: More than one-quarter of people interviewed in their late teens and early 20s had never had sex. \n \n And the number was growing. \n \n The latest round of the quaintly named National Survey of Family Growth found that among 15-to-24-year-olds, 29 percent of females and 27 percent of males reported no sexual contact with another person ever - up from the 22 percent of both sexes when the survey was last conducted in 2002. \n \n \"The public's general perception is that when it comes to young people and sex, the news is bad and likely to get worse,\" said Bill Albert, chief program officer of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, an advocacy organization in Washington. \n \n The seventh and latest round of the survey, first done in 1973, provides a corrective to that view. \n \n \"Many, many young people have been very receptive to the message of delaying sexual activity,\" Albert said. \"There's no doubt about it.\" He added that the nearly 40 percent reduction in teen pregnancy since the 1990s - which experts attribute to both increased condom use and increased abstinence - represents \"extraordinary progress on a social issue that many once considered intractable.\" \n \n The uptick in abstinence is one of many revealing facts arising from structured interviews with a random sample of 13,495 Americans, ages 15 to 44, that were done from 2006 to 2008. The findings provide evidence for almost every theory and supposition about the nation's secret sex life. \n \n The survey results, released Thursday, suggest that oral sex may be a gateway to vaginal sex but that for some teens it is a stopping point. Most adults are monogamous. About 4 in 10 adults have had anal sex. Women are more likely than men to have same-sex liaisons. Or at least are more comfortable talking about them. \n \n Conducted by the Department of Health and Human Services, the survey provides basic information for public health policymakers concerned with such issues as sexually transmitted disease. There is no single fact that it is trying to ferret out or message that its 49 pages of text and tables seek to deliver. \n \n But Anjani Chandra, the demographer who is the lead author of the report, said that \"for some people, it may be news that these behaviors exist at all in the general population.\" \n \n When first run, the survey queried only married and formerly married women. Single women and then men were later included, as were more detailed questions about sexual practices. \n \n Parts of the survey are now so explicit that even though the interviewer and subject are face to face, some questions are asked and answered using a computer screen so that the answers are completely private.",

    "document": "Oscar-winner Vittorio Storaro weighs in on the recent accusations that director Bernardo Bertolucci and star Marlon Brando took advantage of Maria Schneider during the filming of the sexually charged 1972 release. \n \n Vittorio Storaro is considered a legend in the cinematography world. The three-time Oscar winner, known for his lush visual style in classics like Apocalypse Now, Reds and The Last Emperor, has been a longtime collaborator of 76-year-old Italian auteur Bernardo Bertolucci's, beginning in 1970 with the groundbreaking Italian drama The Conformist, which is considered one of the most strikingly cinematic films of all time. \n \n Storaro worked with Bertolucci two years later on Last Tango in Paris. Starring Marlon Brando, who was then basking in the acclaim of his unlikely comeback in Francis Coppola\u2019s The Godfather, the film is a provocative meditation on love and sex that finds Brando\u2019s depressed, recently widowed American become sexually involved with a young Parisian woman portrayed by then-newcomer Maria Schneider. Lauded for its adventurousness by critics and honored with two Academy Award nominations for Brando and Bertolucci, the film nevertheless instantly stirred controversy \u2014 it was banned or censored in multiple countries and was initially given an X-rating by the MPAA. The most controversial moment in the film remains the infamous \u201cbutter\u201d scene, in which Brando, then 48, employs the substance as a lubricant for anal sex with Schneider, who was 19 at the time. \n \n Now, 44 years after its initial release, Tango is once again generating outrage after a 2013 video interview on Dutch television resurfaced in which Bertolucci discusses how some aspects of that infamous scene were sprung on Schneider at the last minute. According to Bertolucci, he and Brando came up with the idea of using butter just before the scene was shot on the set of the Parisian apartment where much of the film takes place. The video interview, which includes Bertolucci expressing regret over how he handled the situation, led to an Internet firestorm, with headlines claiming the director and Brando conspired together to shoot what many felt was a nonconsensual sex scene. \n \n The backlash in Hollywood was immediate, with stars like Jessica Chastain, Chris Evans and Evan Rachel Wood taking to Twitter to condemn both Bertolucci and Brando. Wrote Chastain: \u201cTo all the people that love this film \u2014 you're watching a 19yr old get raped by a 48yr old man. The director planned her attack. I feel sick.\u201d \n \n The Office\u2019s Jenna Fischer called on all copies of the film to be destroyed, claiming it contained an \u201cactual rape.\u201d \n \n On Dec. 5, Bertolucci, released a new statement in which he defended the simulated scene, adding that the only thing unknown to Schneider, who, he said, read and agreed to the explicit nature of the script before signing onto the role, was \u201cthe idea of the butter.\u201d \n \n Storaro, who was on set throughout the shoot, says he had not been following the renewed controversy, but was sent a story from a friend about the resurfaced interview and was shocked that a three-year-old discussion about a film released in 1972 was being turned into a \u201cridiculous\u201d scandal. \n \n Speaking exclusively to THR about the new controversy, Storaro maintains that nothing malicious occurred on set during the shooting of the film, and that the surprise nature of the scene was simply part of Bertolucci\u2019s filmmaking process. Moreover, he claims that Schneider was nothing but thrilled to be a part of the film. \n \n THR spoke with Storaro in Rome about the media firestorm, what the actual process was like on set and why he believes Last Tango in Paris still hits a nerve with viewers after 44 years. \n \n What was your reaction to the media response to the resurfaced interview with Bertolucci? \n \n It\u2019s something that some ignorant journalist put together. I was really disgusted by what was written, which is not true at all. I think the journalists are making an issue that is not really an issue. I read that there was a kind of violence made on her but that\u2019s not true. That\u2019s not true at all. That\u2019s terrible. I was there. We were doing a movie. You don\u2019t do it for real. I was there with two cameras and nothing happened.\u2026 Nobody was raping anybody. That was something made up by a journalist. \n \n Don't make a big issue over this story, because it\u2019s ridiculous. The problem is someone made up a major headline to create a scandal. If I remember the interview correctly, probably Bernardo felt that maybe he didn\u2019t explain it completely to Maria from the beginning and that\u2019s why he felt a little guilty and nothing more than that. What Bernardo said later was he would like to apologize to Maria, only because he probably didn\u2019t explain to her at the beginning what was discussed with Brando. Nothing happened during the shooting. \n \n Was it normal for last-minute story details to be changed on set? \n \n Every morning we would arrive in the apartment and Bernardo had a meeting with Brando to discuss how they would do the scene. Brando wanted to add his own opinion. And after, Bernardo would come to me and explain how he wanted to do the scene, in agreement with Brando. We put together the sequence in any normal way we would do a movie. There is a possibility that Bernardo didn\u2019t mention a specific detail to her.... [Maria] knew perfectly well what she was doing. She knew pretty well what was happening in every scene. She was an actress and had no problems with this. It was an acting job, not something else. \n \n What happened on set the day you shot the butter scene? \n \n I only know that Maria was there like every normal scene and knew we were doing a love scene even if it was a quite unusual film scene.\u2026 Everything was written down, but every morning Bernardo loved to add something. They added something with Brando in every scene, but that was quite normal. They loved to do this. We knew the script and we knew what we wanted to do, but every morning you come up with different ideas, so you are specifically discussing that scene in that moment. \n \n What do you remember about the atmosphere of the set? \n \n It was a fantastic period, from the very first day. Brando was a very intelligent person, so he knew very well the way that Bernardo and I wanted to visualize the story. It was a wonderful atmosphere. Brando was so nice, so generous. In the apartment there was a great energy. When you came into the apartment every morning you could feel that it was a wonderful way to make a movie. We were a very small crew and we had a wonderful time in doing the movie together. \n \n In fact, Maria in the beginning she was kind of snobbish in a French way. [As if] to say, \"I don\u2019t care about Brando, a big American movie star and Bertolucci, a great Italian director,\" and so on. But as we went on in the film, she was crying that the film was ending, that this fantastic experience was coming to an end too soon. That\u2019s something I remember very well. Like everybody in this wonderful atmosphere, she was so sorry that the movie was ending. \n \n We had a great wonderful time with Brando and Bernardo. I worked with Bernardo on The Conformist and The Last Emperor, but Tango was a very special one. It was a really magical moment. You could feel the creative energy coming together, the fantastic way to work together in a very small crew. We stayed in that apartment for seven weeks, because we had very few exteriors. It is one of greatest memories of my life. \n \n Were you surprised at the reaction to the film at the time? \n \n The movie was at that time attacked, particularly in Italy. In Italy they banned the movie. They wanted to burn it. In this time period they were doing so many movies that were much more erotic or violent than Last Tango but Last Tango was touching some principle in connection with a character that is upset with the structure of the family, the structure of the government, the structure of the country. As a principle, when he was making love to her it was like making love to the rest of the world. \n \n That\u2019s why Tango was seen as a movie that should be censored. That\u2019s why it is a great movie. It\u2019s not only erotic, but it touched a difficult moment that one person can have. And [Brando\u2019s character] putting his own life in relation to the world around him, starting from his wife who betrayed him to the moral issues of the world and so on. That\u2019s something written from the very first dialogue. That\u2019s why Brando loved to do the movie, because he loved to put himself in that kind of role. ||||| FILE - In this Oct. 15, 2016, file photo, director Bernardo Bertolucci poses for photographers during a photo call at the Rome Film festival in Rome.

It's terrible.\"Paladino, a Tea Party favorite, on Sunday had sharply attacked homosexuality in a speech to Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn even as the tragedy of gay bullying has riveted the nation and a day after three gay men were tortured in the Bronx because of their sexual orientation.Speaking to an enthusiastic crowd at Congregation Shaarei Chaim in the trendy and traditional Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, where hipsters live cheek by jowl with Hasidic Jews, Paladino was talking about the importance of not \"pandering to the pornographers and perverts\" when he continued on to the issue of gay rights, which he opposes.\"I just think my children and your children would be much better off and much more successful getting married and raising a family, and I don't want them brainwashed into thinking that homosexuality is an equally valid and successful option -- it isn't,\" said Paladino, who has a reputation for being frank to the point of volatility.Paladino also had controversial remarks that he did not deliver, writing at one point in his prepared speech: \"There is nothing to be proud of in being a dysfunctional homosexual\" and being homosexual \"is not how God created us.\"In the \"Today\" show interview, Paladino said he is not anti-gay and that he would \"absolutely\" recruit gays to work in his administration. \"You name it. Wherever their expertise may be, we'll put them in our government.\"Asked about the \"brainwashed\" remark, he said that comment had \"to do with schooling children. My feelings on homosexuality are unequivocal. I have absolutely no problem with it whatsoever. My only reservation is marriage.\"He said that \"children should not be exposed to that at a young age. They don't understand this. It's a very difficult thing. And exposing them to homosexuality, especially at a Gay Pride parade, and I don't know if you've ever been to one, but they wear these little Speedos and they grind against each other. It's just a terrible thing.\"When interviewer Matt Lauer noted that some of the content in Paladino's speech was written by the people he was addressing -- a group of Orthodox Jews -- Paladino said, \"That section of my presentation was written, okay, and it was handed to a staffer and it was put into the [text]. I crossed it out. \"\"That group gets to write the comments they want you to make?\" Lauer asked?\"No,\" Paladino responded. \"It was with a discussion, but then they went too far in the discussion and I crossed all that stuff out. The only part that I said was what you just quoted me\" on about children being brainwashed.Asked to clarify the reference to homosexuality equating with \"dysfunction,\" he replied, \"I did not say that. It's unacceptable.\" Click play below to watch Paladino on the \"Today\" show:In his remarks Sunday, the Republican also had harsh words for his Democratic opponent, Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, for marching in this year's gay pride parade. \"[T]hat's not the example we should be showing our children,\" he said to applause.He added: \"And don't misquote me as wanting to hurt homosexual people in any way. That would be a dastardly lie. My approach is live and let live.\"In his \"Today\" interview, Paladino took another swing at his opponent: \"I was trying to define myself very clearly, as oppposed to Mr. Cuomo. Mr. Cuomo took his daughters to a Gay Pride parade. Is that normal? Would you do it? Would you take your children to a Gay Pride parade? . . . I don't think it is proper for them to go there and watch a couple of grown men grinding against each other. I don't think that's proper. It's disgusting.\"Paladino's campaign manager, Michael R. Caputo, told The New York Times on Sunday that the candidate employs a gay man on his campaign staff and said his views reflect those of the Catholic Church.\"Carl Paladino is simply expressing the views that he holds in his heart as a Catholic,\" Caputo told The Times . \"Carl Paladino is not homophobic, and neither is the Catholic Church.\"Caputo continued that line in remarks to CNN.\"Carl Paladino's position on this is exactly equivalent to the Catholic Church,\" Caputo said . \"And if Andrew Cuomo has a problem with the Catholic Church's position on abortion and homosexuality, he needs to take it up with his parish priest.\"Paladino's comments drew a harsh rebuke from the gay community.\"His words foster a climate of hatred and intolerance instead of helping heal the city of its wounds,\" Michael Silver, executive director of the Transgender Legal Defense & Education Fund, told the Daily News. Silver called on Paladino to apologize immediately.Cuomo spokesman Josh Vlasto blasted Paladino's comments.\"Mr. Paladino's statement displays a stunning homophobia and a glaring disregard for basic equality,\" Vlasto said in a statement. \"These comments along with other views he has espoused make it clear that he is way out of the mainstream and is unfit to represent New York.\"Caputo disagreed. \"The majority of New Yorkers agree with him,\" he said of Paladino's views on homosexuals and gay rights.Polls have shown 58 percent of New Yorkers favor gay marriage, which Paladino says he opposes. Polls have also shown Cuomo expanding his lead on Paladino after the gap had closed last month to six points.Paladino's own personal life has been an issue in the campaign. He has raised charges about Cuomo's sex life that he now admits are unsubstantiated, while Paladino is married but has a 10-year-old daughter from an affair with a former employee of his.

S. 664-671. \n \n (a) The history of the Eighth Amendment and the decisions of this Court make it clear that the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment was designed to protect those convicted of crime. Pp. 430 U. S. 664-668. \n \n (b) There is no need to wrench the Eighth Amendment from its historical context and extend it to public school disciplinary practices. The openness of the public school and its supervision by the community afford significant safeguards against the kinds of abuses from which that Amendment protects convicted criminals. These safeguards are reinforced by the legal constraints of the common law, whereby any punishment going beyond that which is reasonably necessary for the proper education and discipline of the child may result in both civil and criminal liability. Pp. 430 U. S. 668-671. \n \n 2. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not require notice and hearing prior to imposition of corporal punishment as that practice is authorized and limited by the common law. Pp. 430 U. S. 672-682. \n \n Page 430 U. S. 652 \n \n (a) Liberty within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment is implicated where public school authorities, acting under color of state law, deliberately punish a child for misconduct by restraint and infliction of appreciable physical pain. Freedom from bodily restraint and punishment is within the liberty interest in personal security that has historically been protected from state deprivation without due process of law. Pp. 430 U. S. 672-674. \n \n (b) Under the longstanding accommodation between the child's interest in personal security and the traditional common law privilege, there can be no deprivation of substantive rights as long as the corporal punishment remains within the limits of that privilege. The child nonetheless has a strong interest in procedural safeguards that minimize the risk of wrongful punishment and provide for the resolution of disputed questions of justification. Pp. 675-676. \n \n (c) The Florida scheme, considered in light of the openness of the school environment, affords significant protection against unjustified corporal punishment of school children. The teacher and principal must exercise prudence and restraint when they decide that corporal punishment is necessary for disciplinary purposes. If the punishment is later found to be excessive, they may be held liable in damages or be subject to criminal penalties. Where the State has thus preserved what \"has always been the law of the land,\" United States v. Barnett, 376 U. S. 681, 376 U. S. 692, the case for administrative safeguards is significantly less compelling than it would otherwise be. Pp. 430 U. S. 676-680. \n \n (d) Imposing additional administrative safeguards as a constitutional requirement would significantly intrude into the area of educational responsibility that lies primarily with the public school authorities. Prior procedural safeguards require a diversion of educational resources, and school authorities may abandon corporal punishment as a disciplinary measure rather than incur the burdens of complying with procedural requirements. The incremental benefit of invoking the Constitution to impose prior notice and a hearing cannot justify the costs. Pp. 430 U. S. 680-682. \n \n 525 F.2d 909, affirmed. \n \n POWELL, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which BURGER, C.J., and STEWART, BLACKMUN, and REHNQUIST, JJ., joined. WHITE, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which BRENNAN, MARSHALL, and STEVENS, JJ., joined, post, p. 430 U. S. 683. STEVENS, J., filed a dissenting opinion, post, p. 430 U. S. 700. \n \n Page 430 U. S. 653 \n \n MR. JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court. \n \n This case presents questions concerning the use of corporal punishment in public schools: first, whether the paddling of students as a means of maintaining school discipline constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment; and, second, to the extent that paddling is constitutionally permissible, whether the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires prior notice and an opportunity to be heard. \n \n I \n \n Petitioners James Ingraham and Roosevelt Andrews filed the complaint in this case on January 7, 1971, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. [Footnote 1] At the time, both were enrolled in the Charles R. Drew Junior High School in Dade County, Fla., Ingraham in the eighth grade and Andrews in the ninth. The complaint contained three counts, each alleging a separate cause of action for deprivation of constitutional rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981-1988. Counts one and two were individual actions for damages by Ingraham and Andrews based on paddling incidents that allegedly occurred in October, 1970, at Drew Junior High School. Count three was a class action for declaratory and \n \n Page 430 U. S. 654 \n \n injunctive relief filed on behalf of all students in the Dade County schools. [Footnote 2] Named as defendants in all counts were respondents Willie J. Wright (principal at Drew Junior High School), Lemmie Deliford (an assistant principal), Solomon Barnes (an assistant to the principal), and Edward L. Whigham (superintendent of the Dade County School System). [Footnote 3] \n \n Petitioners presented their evidence at a week-long trial before the District Court. At the close of petitioners' case, respondents moved for dismissal of count three \"on the ground that, upon the facts and the law, the plaintiff has shown no right to relief,\" Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 41(b), and for a ruling that the evidence would be insufficient to go to a jury on counts one and two. [Footnote 4] The District Court granted the motion as to all three counts, and dismissed the complaint without hearing evidence on behalf of the school authorities. App. 142-150. \n \n Page 430 U. S. 655 \n \n Petitioners' evidence may be summarized briefly. In the 1970-1971 school year, many of the 237 schools in Dade County used corporal punishment as a means of maintaining discipline pursuant to Florida legislation and a local School Board regulation. [Footnote 5] The statute then in effect authorized limited corporal punishment by negative inference, proscribing punishment which was \"degrading or unduly severe\" or which was inflicted without prior consultation with the principal or the teacher in charge of the school. Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 232.27 (1961). [Footnote 6] The regulation, Dade County School Board Policy \n \n Page 430 U. S. 656 \n \n 5144, contained explicit, directions and limitations. [Footnote 7] The authorized punishment consisted of paddling the recalcitrant student on the buttocks with a flat wooden paddle measuring less than two feet long, three to four inches wide, and about one-half inch thick. The normal punishment was limited to one to five \"licks\" or blows with the paddle, and resulted in \n \n Page 430 U. S. 657 \n \n no apparent physical injury to the student. School authorities viewed corporal punishment as a less drastic means of discipline than suspension or expulsion. Contrary to the procedural requirements of the statute and regulation, teachers often paddled students on their own authority without first consulting the principal. [Footnote 8] \n \n Petitioners focused on Drew Junior High School, the school in which both Ingraham and Andrews were enrolled in the fall of 1970. In an apparent reference to Drew, the District Court found that \n \n \"[t]he instances of punishment which could be characterized as severe, accepting the students' testimony as credible, took place in one junior high school.\" \n \n App. 147. The evidence, consisting mainly of the testimony of 16 students, suggests that the regime at Drew was exceptionally harsh. The testimony of Ingraham and Andrews, in support of their individual claims for damages, is illustrative. Because he was slow to respond to his teacher's instructions, Ingraham was subjected to more than 20 licks with a paddle while being held over a table in the principal's office. The paddling was so severe that he suffered a hematoma [Footnote 9] requiring medical attention and keeping him out of school for several days. [Footnote 10] Andrews was paddled several times for minor infractions. On two occasions, he was struck on his arms, once depriving him of the full use of his arm for a week. [Footnote 11] \n \n Page 430 U. S. 658 \n \n The District Court made no findings on the credibility of the students' testimony. Rather, assuming their testimony to be credible, the court found no constitutional basis for relief. With respect to count three, the class action, the court concluded that the punishment authorized and practiced generally in the county schools violated no constitutional right. Id. at 143, 149. With respect to counts one and two, the individual damages actions, the court concluded that, while corporal punishment could in some cases violate the Eighth Amendment, in this case, a jury could not lawfully find \n \n \"the elements of severity, arbitrary infliction, unacceptability in terms of contemporary standards, or gross disproportion which are necessary to bring 'punishment' to the constitutional level of 'cruel and unusual punishment.'\" \n \n Id. at 143. \n \n A panel of the Court of Appeals voted to reverse. 498 F.2d 248 (CA5 1974). The panel concluded that the punishment was so severe and oppressive as to violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, and that the procedures outlined in Policy 5144 failed to satisfy the requirements of the Due Process Clause. Upon rehearing, the en banc court rejected these conclusions and affirmed the judgment of the District Court. 525 F.2d 909 (1976). The full court held that the Due Process Clause did not require notice or an opportunity to be heard: \n \n \"In essence, we refuse to set forth, as constitutionally mandated, procedural standards for an activity which is not substantial enough, on a constitutional level, to justify the time and effort which would have to be expended by the school in adhering to those procedures or to justify further interference by federal courts into the internal affairs of public schools.\" \n \n Id. at 919. The court also rejected the petitioners' substantive contentions. The Eighth Amendment, in the court's view, was simply inapplicable to corporal punishment in public \n \n Page 430 U. S. 659 \n \n schools. Stressing the likelihood of civil and criminal liability in state law, if petitioners' evidence were believed, the court held that \n \n \"[t]he administration of corporal punishment in public schools, whether or not excessively administered, does not come within the scope of Eighth Amendment protection.\" \n \n Id. at 915. Nor was there any substantive violation of the Due Process Clause. The court noted that \n \n \"[p]addling of recalcitrant children has long been an accepted method of promoting good behavior and instilling notions of responsibility and decorum into the mischievous heads of school children.\" \n \n Id. at 917. The court refused to examine instances of punishment individually: \n \n \"We think it a misuse of our judicial power to determine, for example, whether a teacher has acted arbitrarily in paddling a particular child for certain behavior or whether, in a particular instance of misconduct, five licks would have been a more appropriate punishment than ten licks. . . .\" \n \n Ibid. \n \n We granted certiorari, limited to the questions of cruel and unusual punishment and procedural due process. 425 U.S. 990. [Footnote 12] \n \n II \n \n In addressing the scope of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment, this Court has found it useful to refer to \"[t]raditional common law concepts,\" Powell v. Texas, 392 U. S. 514, 392 U. S. 535 (1968) (plurality opinion), and to the \"attitude[s] which our society has traditionally taken.\" Id. at 392 U. S. 531. So, too, in defining the requirements \n \n Page 430 U. S. 660 \n \n of procedural due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, the Court has been attuned to what \"has always been the law of the land,\" United States v. Barnett, 376 U. S. 681, 376 U. S. 692 (1964), and to \"traditional ideas of fair procedure.\" Greene v. McElroy, 360 U. S. 474, 360 U. S. 508 (1959). We therefore begin by examining the way in which our traditions and our laws have responded to the use of corporal punishment in public schools. \n \n The use of corporal punishment in this country as a means of disciplining schoolchildren dates back to the colonial period. [Footnote 13] It has survived the transformation of primary and secondary education from the colonials' reliance on optional private arrangements to our present system of compulsory education and dependence on public schools. [Footnote 14] Despite the general abandonment of corporal punishment as a means of punishing criminal offenders, [Footnote 15] the practice continues to play a role in the public education of schoolchildren in most parts of the country. [Footnote 16] Professional and public opinion is sharply divided on the practice, [Footnote 17] and has been for more than \n \n Page 430 U. S. 661 \n \n a century. [Footnote 18] Yet we can discern no trend toward its elimination. \n \n At common law, a single principle has governed the use of corporal punishment since before the American Revolution: teachers may impose reasonable but not excessive force to discipline a child. [Footnote 19] Blackstone catalogued among the \"absolute rights of individuals\" the right \"to security from the corporal insults of menaces, assaults, beating, and wounding,\" 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *134, but he did not regard it a \"corporal insult\" for a teacher to inflict \"moderate correction\" on a child in his care. To the extent that force was \"necessary to answer the purposes for which [the teacher] is employed,\" Blackstone viewed it as \"justifiable or lawful.\" Id. at *453; 3 id. at *120. The basic doctrine has not changed. The prevalent rule in this country today privileges such force as a teacher or administrator \"reasonably believes to be necessary for [the child's] proper control, training, or education.\" Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 147(2) (1965); see id. \u00a7 153(2). To the extent that the force is excessive or unreasonable, the educator in virtually all States is subject to possible civil and criminal liability. [Footnote 20] \n \n Page 430 U. S. 662 \n \n Although the early cases viewed the authority of the teacher as deriving from the parents, [Footnote 21] the concept of parental delegation has been replaced by the view -- more consonant with compulsory education laws -- that the State itself may impose such corporal punishment as is reasonably necessary \"for the proper education of the child and for the maintenance of group discipline.\" 1 F. Harper & F. James, Law of Torts \u00a7 3.20, p. 292 (1956). [Footnote 22] All of the circumstances are to be taken into account in determining whether the punishment is reasonable in a particular case. Among the most important considerations are the seriousness of the offense, the attitude and past behavior of the child, the nature and severity of the punishment, the age and strength of the child, and the availability of less severe but equally effective means of discipline. Id. at 290-291; Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 150, Comments c-e, p. 268 (1965). \n \n Of the 23 States that have addressed the problem through legislation, 21 have authorized the moderate use of corporal punishment in public schools. [Footnote 23] Of these States, only a few \n \n Page 430 U. S. 663 \n \n have elaborated an the common law test of reasonableness, typically providing for approval or notification of the child's parents, [Footnote 24] or for infliction of punishment only by the principal [Footnote 25] or in the presence of an adult witness. [Footnote 26] Only two States, Massachusetts and New Jersey, have prohibited all corporal punishment in heir public schools. [Footnote 27] Where the legislatures have at acted, the state courts have uniformly preserved the common law rule permitting teachers to use reasonable force in disciplining children in their charge. [Footnote 28] \n \n Against this background of historical and contemporary approval of reasonable corporal punishment, we turn to the constitutional question before us. \n \n Page 430 U. S. 664 \n \n III \n \n The Eighth Amendment provides: \"Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\" Bail, fines, and punishment traditionally have been associated with the criminal process, and, by subjecting the three to parallel limitations, the text of the Amendment suggests an intention to limit the power of those entrusted with the criminal law function of government. An examination of the history of the Amendment and the decisions of this Court construing the proscription against cruel and unusual punishment confirms that it was designed to protect those convicted of crimes. We adhere to this longstanding limitation, and hold that the Eighth Amendment does not apply to the paddling of children as a means of maintaining discipline in public schools. \n \n A \n \n The history of the Eighth Amendment is well known. [Footnote 29] The text was taken, almost verbatim, from a provision of the Virginia Declaration of Rights of 1776, which in turn derived from the English Bill of Rights of 1689. The English version, adopted after the accession of William and Mary, was intended to curb the excesses of English judges under the reign of James II. Historians have viewed the English provision as a reaction either to the \"Bloody Assize,\" the treason trials conducted by Chief Justice Jeffreys in 1685 after the abortive rebellion of the Duke of Monmouth, [Footnote 30] or to the perjury prosecution of Titus Oates in the same year. [Footnote 31] In \n \n Page 430 U. S. 665 \n \n either case, the exclusive concern of the English version was the conduct of judges in enforcing the criminal law. The original draft introduced in the House of Commons provided: [Footnote 32] \n \n \"The requiring excessive bail of persons committed in criminal cases and imposing excessive fines, and illegal punishments, to be prevented.\" \n \n Although the reference to \"criminal cases\" was eliminated from the final draft, the preservation of a similar reference in the preamble [Footnote 33] indicates that the deletion was without substantive significance. Thus, Blackstone treated each of the provision's three prohibitions as bearing only on criminal proceedings and judgments. [Footnote 34] \n \n The Americans who adopted the language of this part of the English Bill of Rights in framing their own State and Federal Constitutions 100 years later feared the imposition of torture and other cruel punishments not only by judges acting beyond their lawful authority, but also by legislatures engaged in making the laws by which judicial authority would be measured. Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349, 217 U. S. 371-373 (1910). Indeed, the principal concern of the American Framers appears to have been with the legislative definition of crimes and punishments. In re Kemmler, 136 U. S. 436, 136 U. S. 446-447 (1890); \n \n Page 430 U. S. 666 \n \n Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, 408 U. S. 263 (1972) (BRENNAN, J., concurring). But if the American provision was intended to restrain government more broadly than its English model, the subject to which it was intended to apply -- the criminal process -- was the same. \n \n At the time of its ratification, the original Constitution was criticized in the Massachusetts and Virginia Conventions for its failure to provide any protection for persons convicted of crimes. [Footnote 35] This criticism provided the impetus for inclusion of the Eighth Amendment in the Bill of Rights. When the Eighth Amendment was debated in the First Congress, it was met by the objection that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause might have the effect of outlawing what were then the common criminal punishments of hanging, whipping, and earcropping. 1 Annals of Cong. 754 (1789). The objection was not heeded, \"precisely because the legislature would otherwise have had the unfettered power to prescribe punishments for crimes.\" Furman v. Georgia, supra at 408 U. S. 263. \n \n B \n \n In light of this history, it is not surprising to find that every decision of this Court considering whether a punishment is \"cruel and unusual\" within the meaning of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments has dealt with a criminal punishment. \n \n Page 430 U. S. 667 \n \n See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97 (1976) (incarceration without medical care); Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153 (1976) (execution for murder); Furman v. Georgia, supra, (execution for murder); Powell v. Texas, 392 U. S. 514 (1968) (plurality opinion) ($20 fine for public drunkenness); Robinson v. California, 370 U. S. 660 (1962) (incarceration as a criminal for addiction to narcotics); Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86 (1958) (plurality opinion) (expatriation for desertion); Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U. S. 459 (1947) (execution by electrocution after a failed first attempt); Weems v. United States, supra, (15 years' imprisonment and other penalties for falsifying an official document); Howard v. Fleming, 191 U. S. 126 (1903) (10 years' imprisonment for conspiracy to defraud); In re Kemmler, supra, (execution by electrocution); Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U. S. 130 (1879) (execution by firing squad); Pervear v. Commonwealth, 5 Wall. 475 (1867) (fine and imprisonment at hard labor for bootlegging). \n \n These decisions recognize that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause circumscribes the criminal process in three ways: first, it limits the kinds of punishment that can be imposed on those convicted of crimes, e.g., Estelle v. Gamble, supra; Trop v. Dulles, supra; second, it proscribes punishment grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime, e.g., Weems v. United States, supra; and third, it imposes substantive limits on what can be made criminal and punished as such, e.g., Robinson v. California, supra. We have recognized the last limitation as one to be applied sparingly. \n \n \"The primary purpose of [the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause] has always been considered, and properly so, to be directed at the method or kind of punishment imposed for the violation of criminal statutes. . . .\" \n \n Powell v. Texas, supra at 392 U. S. 531-532 (plurality opinion). \n \n In the few cases where the Court has had occasion to confront claims that impositions outside the criminal process constituted cruel and unusual punishment, it has had no difficulty \n \n Page 430 U. S. 668 \n \n finding the Eighth Amendment inapplicable. Thus, in Fong Yue Ting v. United States, 149 U. S. 698 (1893), the Court held the Eighth Amendment inapplicable to the deportation of aliens on the ground that \"deportation is not a punishment for crime.\" Id. at 149 U. S. 730; see Mahler v. Eby, 264 U. S. 32 (1924); Bugajewitz v. Adams, 228 U. S. 685 (1913). And in Uphaus v. Wyman, 360 U. S. 72 (1959), the Court sustained a judgment of civil contempt, resulting in incarceration pending compliance with a subpoena, against a claim that the judgment imposed cruel and unusual punishment. It was emphasized that the case involved \"essentially a civil remedy designed for the benefit of other parties . . . exercised for centuries to secure compliance with judicial decrees.'\" Id. at 360 U. S. 81, quoting Green v. United States, 356 U. S. 165, 356 U. S. 197 (1958) (dissenting opinion). [Footnote 36] \n \n C \n \n Petitioners acknowledge that the original design of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause was to limit criminal punishments, but urge nonetheless that the prohibition should be extended to ban the paddling of schoolchildren. Observing that the Framers of the Eighth Amendment could not have envisioned our present system of public and compulsory education, with its opportunities for noncriminal punishments, petitioners contend that extension of the prohibition against cruel punishments is necessary lest we afford greater protection \n \n Page 430 U. S. 669 \n \n to criminals than to school children. It would be anomalous, they say, if school children could be beaten without constitutional redress, while hardened criminals suffering the same beatings at the hands of their jailers might have a valid claim under the Eighth Amendment. See Jackson v. Bishop, 404 F.2d 571 (CA8 1968); cf. Estelle v. Gamble, supra. Whatever force this logic may have in other settings, [Footnote 37] we find it an inadequate basis for wrenching the Eighth Amendment from its historical context and extending it to traditional disciplinary practices in the public schools. \n \n The prisoner and the school child stand in wholly different circumstances, separated by the harsh facts of criminal conviction and incarceration. The prisoner's conviction entitles the State to classify him a a \"criminal,\" and his incarceration deprives him of the freedom \"to be with family and friends and to form the other enduring attachments of normal life.\" Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U. S. 471, 408 U. S. 482 (1972); see Meachum v. Fano, 427 U. S. 215, 427 U. S. 224-225 (1976). Prison brutality, as the Court of Appeals observed in this case, is \n \n \"part of the total punishment to which the individual is being subjected for his crime and, as such, is a proper subject for Eighth Amendment scrutiny.\" \n \n 525 F.2d at 915. [Footnote 38] Even so, the protection afforded \n \n Page 430 U. S. 670 \n \n by the Eighth Amendment is limited. After incarceration, only the \"unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain,'\" Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. at 429 U. S. 103, quoting Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. at 428 U. S. 173, constitutes cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth Amendment. \n \n The school child has little need for the protection of the Eighth Amendment. Though attendance may not always be voluntary, the public school remains an open institution. Except perhaps when very young, the child is not physically restrained from leaving school during school hours; and at the end of the school day, the child is invariably free to return home. Even while at school, the child brings with him the support of family and friends, and is rarely apart from teachers and other pupils who may witness and protest any instances of mistreatment. \n \n The openness of the public school and its supervision by the community afford significant safeguards against the kinds of abuses from which the Eighth Amendment protects the prisoner. In virtually every community where corporal punishment is permitted in the schools, these safeguards are reinforced by the legal constraints of the common law. Public school teachers and administrators are privileged at common law to inflict only such corporal punishment as is reasonably necessary for the proper education and discipline of the child; any punishment going beyond the privilege may result in both civil and criminal liability. See 430 U. S. supra. As long as the schools are open to public scrutiny, there is no reason to believe that the common law constraints will not effectively remedy and deter excesses such as those alleged in this case. [Footnote 39] \n \n Page 430 U. S. 671 \n \n We conclude that, when public school teachers or administrators impose disciplinary corporal punishment, the Eighth Amendment is inapplicable. The pertinent constitutional question is whether the imposition is consonant with the requirements of due process. [Footnote 40] \n \n Page 430 U. S. 672 \n \n IV \n \n The Fourteenth Amendment prohibits any state deprivation of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. Application of this prohibition requires the familiar two-stage analysis: we must first ask whether the asserted individual interests are encompassed within the Fourteenth Amendment's protection of \"life, liberty or property\"; if protected interests are implicated, we then must decide what procedures constitute \"due process of law.\" Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. at 408 U. S. 481; Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U. S. 564, 408 U. S. 569-572 (1972). See Friendly, Some Kind of Hearing, 123 U.Pa.L.Rev. 1267 (1975). Following that analysis here, we find that corporal punishment in public schools implicates a constitutionally protected liberty interest, but we hold that the traditional common law remedies are fully adequate to afford due process. \n \n A \n \n \"[T]he range of interests protected by procedural due process is not infinite.\" Board of Regents v. Roth, supra at 408 U. S. 570. We have repeatedly rejected \"the notion that any grievous loss visited upon a person by the State is sufficient to invoke the procedural protections of the Due Process Clause.\" Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. at 427 U. S. 224. Due process is required only when a decision of the State implicates an interest within the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment. And \n \n \"to determine whether due process requirements apply in the first place, we must look not to the 'weight,' but to the nature, of the interest at stake.\" \n \n Roth, supra at 408 U. S. 570-571. \n \n The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, later incorporated into the Fourteenth, was intended to give Americans \n \n Page 430 U. S. 673 \n \n at least the protection against governmental power that they had enjoyed as Englishmen against the power of the Crown. The liberty preserved from deprivation without due process included the right \"generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.\" Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390, 262 U. S. 399 (1923); see Dent v. West Virginia, 129 U. S. 114, 129 U. S. 123-124 (1889). Among the historic liberties so protected was a right to be free from, and to obtain judicial relief for, unjustified intrusions on personal security. [Footnote 41] \n \n While the contours of this historic liberty interest in the context of our federal system of government have not been defined precisely, [Footnote 42] they always have been thought to encompass \n \n Page 430 U. S. 674 \n \n freedom from bodily restraint and punishment. See Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165 (1952). It is fundamental that the state cannot hold and physically punish an individual except in accordance with due process of law. \n \n This constitutionally protected liberty interest is at stake in this case. There is, of course, a de minimis level of imposition with which the Constitution is not concerned. But at least where school authorities, acting under color of state law, deliberately decide to punish a child for misconduct by restraining the child and inflicting appreciable physical pain, we hold that Fourteenth Amendment liberty interests are implicated. [Footnote 43] \n \n B \n \n \"[T]he question remains what process is due.\" Morrissey v. Brewer, supra at 408 U. S. 481. Were it not for the common law privilege permitting teachers to inflict reasonable corporal punishment on children in their care, and the availability of the traditional remedies for abuse, the case for requiring advance procedural safeguards would be strong indeed. [Footnote 44] But here we deal with a punishment -- paddling -- within that tradition, \n \n Page 430 U. S. 675 \n \n and the question is whether the common law remedies are adequate to afford due process. \n \n \"'[D]ue process,' unlike some legal rules, is not a technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time, place and circumstances. . . . Representing a profound attitude of fairness . . . , 'due process' is compounded of history, reason, the past course of decisions, and stout confidence in the strength of the democratic faith which we profess. . . .\" \n \n Anti-Fascist Comm. v. McGrath, 341 U. S. 123, 341 U. S. 162-163 (1951) (Frankfurter, J., concurring). Whether, in this case, the common law remedies for excessive corporal punishment constitute due process of law must turn on an analysis of the competing interests at stake, viewed against the background of \"history, reason, [and] the past course of decisions.\" The analysis requires consideration of three distinct factors: \n \n \"first, the private interest that will be affected . . . ; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest . . . and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the [state] interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.\" \n \n Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 424 U. S. 335 (1976). Cf. Arnett v. Kennedy, 416 U. S. 134, 416 U. S. 167-168 (1974) (POWELL, J., concurring). \n \n 1 \n \n Because it is rooted in history, the child's liberty interest in avoiding corporal punishment while in the care of public school authorities is subject to historical limitations. Under the common law, an invasion of personal security gave rise to a right to recover damages in a subsequent judicial proceeding. 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *120-121. But the right of recovery was qualified by the concept of justification. Thus, there could be no recovery against a teacher who gave only \"moderate correction\" to a child. Id. at *120. To the \n \n Page 430 U. S. 676 \n \n extent that the force used was reasonable in light of its purpose, it was not wrongful, but rather \"justifiable or lawful.\" Ibid. \n \n The concept that reasonable corporal punishment in school is justifiable continues to be recognized in the laws of most States. See 430 U. S. supra. It represents \"the balance struck by this country,\" Poe v. Ullman, 367 U. S. 497, 367 U. S. 542 (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting), between the child's interest in personal security and the traditional view that some limited corporal punishment may be necessary in the course of a child's education. Under that longstanding accommodation of interests, there can be no deprivation of substantive rights as long as disciplinary corporal punishment is within the limits of the common law privilege. \n \n This is not to say that the child's interest in procedural safeguards is insubstantial. The school disciplinary process is not \"a totally accurate, unerring process, never mistaken and never unfair. . . .\" Goss v. Lopez, 419 U. S. 565, 419 U. S. 579-580 (1975). In any deliberate infliction of corporal punishment on a child who is restrained for that purpose, there is some risk that the intrusion on the child's liberty will be unjustified, and therefore unlawful. In these circumstances, the child has a strong interest in procedural safeguards that minimize the risk of wrongful punishment and provide for the resolution of disputed questions of justification. \n \n We turn now to a consideration of the safeguards that are available under applicable Florida law. \n \n 2 \n \n Florida has continued to recognize, and indeed has strengthened by statute, the common law right of a child not to be subjected to excessive corporal punishment in school. Under Florida law, the teacher and principal of the school decide in the first instance whether corporal punishment is reasonably necessary under the circumstances in order to discipline \n \n Page 430 U. S. 677 \n \n a child who.has misbehaved. But they must exercise prudence and restraint. For Florida has preserved the traditional judicial proceedings for determining whether the punishment was justified. If the punishment inflicted is later found to have been excessive -- not reasonably believed at the time to be necessary for the child's discipline or training -- the school authorities inflicting it may be held liable in damages to the child and, if malice is shown, they may be subject to criminal penalties. [Footnote 45] \n \n Although students have testified in this case to specific instances of abuse, there is every reason to believe that such mistreatment is an aberration. The uncontradicted evidence suggests that corporal punishment in the Dade County schools was, \"[w]ith the exception of a few cases, . . . unremarkable in physical severity.\" App. 147. Moreover, because paddlings are usually inflicted in response to conduct directly \n \n Page 430 U. S. 678 \n \n observed by teachers in their presence, the risk that a child will be paddled without cause is typically insignificant. In the ordinary case, a disciplinary paddling neither threatens seriously to violate any substantive rights nor condemns the child \"to suffer grievous loss of any kind.\" Anti-Fascist Comm. v. McGrath, 341 U.S. at 341 U. S. 168 (Frankfurter, J., concurring). \n \n In those cases where severe punishment is contemplated, the available civil and criminal sanctions for abuse -- considered in light of the openness of the school environment -- afford significant protection against unjustified corporal punishment. See supra at 430 U. S. 670. Teachers and school authorities are unlikely to inflict corporal punishment unnecessarily or excessively when a possible consequence of doing so is the institution of civil or criminal proceedings against them. [Footnote 46] \n \n It still may be argued, of course, that the child's liberty interest would be better protected if the common law remedies were supplemented by the administrative safeguards of prior notice and a hearing. We have found frequently that some kind of prior hearing is necessary to guard against arbitrary impositions on interests protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. \n \n Page 430 U. S. 679 \n \n See, e.g., Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. at 408 U. S. 569-570; Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539, 418 U. S. 557-558 (1974); cf. Friendly, 123 U.Pa.L.Rev. at 1275-1277. But where the State has preserved what \"has always been the law of the land,\" United States v. Barnett, 376 U. S. 681 (1964), the case for administrative safeguards is significantly less compelling. [Footnote 47] \n \n There is a relevant analogy in the criminal law. Although the Fourth Amendment specifically proscribes \"seizure\" of a person without probable cause, the risk that police will act unreasonably in arresting a suspect is not thought to require an advance determination of the facts. In United States v. Watson, 423 U. S. 411 (1976), we reaffirmed the traditional common law rule that police officers may make warrantless public arrests on probable cause. Although we observed that an advance determination of probable cause by a magistrate would be desirable, we declined \n \n \"to transform this judicial preference into a constitutional rule when the judgment of the Nation and Congress has for so long been to authorize warrantless public arrests on probable cause. . . .\" \n \n Id. at 423 U. S. 423; see id. at 423 U. S. 429 (POWELL, J., concurring). Despite the distinct possibility that a police officer may improperly assess the facts and thus unconstitutionally deprive an individual of \n \n Page 430 U. S. 680 \n \n liberty, we declined to depart from the traditional rule by which the officer's perception is subjected to judicial scrutiny only after the fact. [Footnote 48] There is no more reason to depart from tradition and require advance procedural safeguards for intrusions on personal security to which the Fourth Amendment does not apply. \n \n 3 \n \n But even if the need for advance procedural safeguards were clear, the question would remain whether the incremental benefit could justify the cost. Acceptance of petitioners' claims would work a transformation in the law governing corporal punishment in Florida and most other States. Given the impracticability of formulating a rule of procedural due process that varies with the severity of the particular imposition, [Footnote 49] the prior hearing petitioners seek would have to precede any paddling, however moderate or trivial. \n \n Such a universal constitutional requirement would significantly burden the use of corporal punishment as a disciplinary measure. Hearings -- even informal hearings -- require time, personnel, and a diversion of attention from normal school pursuits. School authorities may well choose to abandon corporal punishment rather than incur the burdens of complying with the procedural requirements. Teachers, properly concerned with maintaining authority in the classroom, may well prefer to rely on other disciplinary measures -- which they may view as less effective -- rather than confront the \n \n Page 430 U. S. 681 \n \n possible disruption that prior notice and a hearing may entail. [Footnote 50] Paradoxically, such an alteration of disciplinary policy is most likely to occur in the ordinary case, where the contemplated punishment is well within the common law privilege. [Footnote 51] \n \n Elimination or curtailment of corporal punishment would be welcomed by many as a societal advance. But when such a policy choice may result from this Court's determination of an asserted right to due process, rather than from the normal processes of community debate and legislative action, the societal costs cannot be dismissed as insubstantial. [Footnote 52] We are reviewing here a legislative judgment, rooted in history and reaffirmed in the laws of many States, that corporal punishment serves important educational interests. This judgment must be viewed in light of the disciplinary problems commonplace in the schools. As noted in Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. at 419 U. S. 580: \"Events calling for discipline are frequent occurrences, and sometimes require immediate, effective action.\" [Footnote 53] Assessment \n \n Page 430 U. S. 682 \n \n of the need for, and the appropriate means of maintaining, school discipline is committed generally to the discretion of school authorities subject to state law. \n \n \"[T]he Court has repeatedly emphasized the need for affirming the comprehensive authority of the States and of school officials, consistent with fundamental constitutional safeguards, to prescribe and control conduct in the schools.\" \n \n Tinker v. Des Moines School Dist., 393 U. S. 503, 393 U. S. 507 (1969). [Footnote 54] \n \n \"At some point, the benefit of an additional safeguard to the individual affected . . . and to society in terms of increased assurance that the action is just, may be outweighed by the cost.\" \n \n Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. at 424 U. S. 348. We think that point has been reached in this case. In view of the low incidence of abuse, the openness of our schools, and the common law safeguards that already exist, the risk of error that may result in violation of a school child's substantive rights can only be regarded a minimal. Imposing additional administrative safeguards as a constitutional requirement might reduce that risk marginally, but would also entail a significant intrusion into an area of primary educational responsibility. We conclude that the Due Process Clause does not require notice and a hearing prior to the imposition of corporal punishment in the public schools, as that practice is authorized and limited by the common law. [Footnote 55] \n \n Page 430 U. S. 683 \n \n V \n \n Petitioners cannot prevail on either of the theories before us in this case. The Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment is inapplicable to school paddlings, and the Fourteenth Amendment's requirement of procedural due process is satisfied by Florida's preservation of common law constraints and remedies. We therefore agree with the Court of Appeals that petitioners' evidence affords no basis for injunctive relief, and that petitioners cannot recover damages on the basis of any Eighth Amendment or procedural due process violation. \n \n Affirmed. \n \n [Footnote 1] \n \n As Ingraham and Andrews were minors, the complaint was filed in the names of Eloise Ingraham, James' mother, and Willie Everett, Roosevelt's father. \n \n [Footnote 2] \n \n The District Court certified the class, under Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. 23(b)(2) and (c)(1), as follows: \n \n \"'All students of the Dade County School system who are subject to the corporal punishment policies issued by the Defendant, Dade County School Board. . . .'\" \n \n App. 17. One student was specifically excepted from the class by request. \n \n [Footnote 3] \n \n The complaint also named the Dade County School Board as a defendant, but the Court of Appeals held that the Board was not amenable to suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981-1988, and dismissed the suit against the Board for want of jurisdiction. 525 F.2d 909, 912 (CA5 1976). This aspect of the Court of Appeals' judgment is not before us. \n \n [Footnote 4] \n \n Petitioners had waived their right to jury trial on the claims for damages in counts one and two, but respondents had not. The District Court proceeded initially to hear evidence only on count three, the claim for injunctive relief. At the close of petitioners' case, however, the parties agreed that the evidence offered on count three (together with certain stipulated testimony) would be considered, for purposes of a motion for directed verdict, as if it had also been offered on counts one and two. It was understood that respondents could reassert a right to jury trial if the motion were denied. App. 142. \n \n [Footnote 5] \n \n The evidence does not show how many of the schools actually employed corporal punishment as a means of maintaining discipline. The authorization of the practice by the School Board extended to 231 of the schools in the 1970-1971 school year, but at least 10 of those schools did not administer corporal punishment as a matter of school policy. Id. at 137-139. \n \n [Footnote 6] \n \n In the 1970-1971 school year, \u00a7 232.27 provided: \n \n \"Each teacher or other member of the staff of any school shall assume such authority for the control of pupils as may be assigned to him by the principal and shall keep good order in the classroom and in other places in which he is assigned to be in charge of pupils, but he shall not inflict corporal punishment before consulting the principal or teacher in charge of the school, and in no case shall such punishment be degrading or unduly severe in its nature. . . .\" \n \n Effective July 1, 1976, the Florida Legislature amended the law governing corporal punishment. Section 232.27 now reads: \n \n \"Subject to law and to the rules of the district school board, each teacher or other member of the staff of any school shall have such authority for the control and discipline of students as may be assigned to him by the principal or his designated representative and shall keep good order in the classroom and in other places in which he is assigned to be in charge of students. If a teacher feels that corporal punishment is necessary, at least the following procedures shall be followed:\" \n \n \"(1) The use of corporal punishment shall be approved in principle by the principal before it is used, but approval is not necessary for each specific instance in which it is used.\" \n \n \"(2) A teacher or principal may administer corporal punishment only in the presence of another adult who is informed beforehand, and in the student's presence, of the reason for the punishment.\" \n \n \"(3) A teacher or principal who has administered punishment shall, upon request, provide the pupil's parent or guardian with a written explanation of the reason for the punishment and the name of the other [adult] who was present.\" \n \n Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 232.27 (1977) (codifier's notation omitted). Corporal punishment is now defined as \n \n \"the moderate use of physical force or physical contact by a teacher or principal as may be necessary to maintain discipline or to enforce school rules.\" \n \n \u00a7 228.041(28). The local school boards are expressly authorized to adopt rules governing student conduct and discipline, and are directed to make available codes of student conduct. \u00a7 230.23(6). Teachers and principals are given immunity from civil and criminal liability for enforcing disciplinary rules, \"[e]xcept in the case of excessive force or cruel and unusual punishment. . . .\" \u00a7 232.275. \n \n [Footnote 7] \n \n In the 1970-1971 school year, Policy 5144 authorized corporal punishment where the failure of other means of seeking cooperation from the student made its use necessary. The regulation specified that the principal should determine the necessity for corporal punishment, that the student should understand the seriousness of the offense and the reason for the punishment, and that the punishment should be administered in the presence of another adult in circumstances not calculated to hold the student up to shame or ridicule. The regulation cautioned against using corporal punishment against a student under psychological or medical treatment, and warned that the person administering the punishment \"must realize his own personal liabilities\" in any case of physical injury. App. 15. \n \n While this litigation was pending in the District Court, the Dade County School Board amended Policy 5144 to standardize the size of the paddles used in accordance with the description in the text, to proscribe striking a child with a paddle elsewhere than on the buttocks, to limit the permissible number of \"licks\" (five for elementary and intermediate grades and seven for junior and senior grades), and to require a contemporaneous explanation of the need for the punishment to the student and a subsequent notification to the parents. App. 126-128. \n \n [Footnote 8] \n \n 498 F.2d 248, 255, and n. 7 (1974) (original panel opinion), vacated on rehearing, 525 F.2d 909 (1976); App. 48, 138, 146; Exhibits 14, 15. \n \n [Footnote 9] \n \n Stedman's Medical Dictionary (23d ed.1976) defines \"hematoma\" as \n \n \"[a] localized mass of extravasated blood that is relatively or completely confined within an organ or tissue . . . ; the blood is usually clotted (or partly clotted), and, depending on how long it has been there, may manifest various degrees of organization and decolorization.\" \n \n [Footnote 10] \n \n App. 3-4, 18-20, 68-85, 129-136. \n \n [Footnote 11] \n \n Id. at 4-5, 104-113.

You let them loose; you do more -- you depart from the genius of your country. . . .\" \n \n 3 id. at 47. \n \n [Footnote 36] \n \n In urging us to extend the Eighth Amendment to ban school paddlings, petitioners rely on the many decisions in which this Court has held that the prohibition against \"cruel and unusual\" punishments is not \"fastened to the obsolete, but may acquire meaning as public opinion becomes enlightened by a humane justice.'\" Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. at 428 U. S. 171 (joint opinion); see, e.g., Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 356 U. S. 100-101 (1958) (plurality opinion); Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349, 217 U. S. 373, 217 U. S. 378 (1910). This reliance is misplaced. Our Eighth Amendment decisions have referred to \"evolving standards of decency,\" Trop v. Dulles, supra at 356 U. S. 101, only in determining whether criminal punishments are \"cruel and unusual\" under the Amendment. \n \n [Footnote 37] \n \n Some punishments, though not labeled \"criminal\" by the State, may be sufficiently analogous to criminal punishments in the circumstances in which they are administered to justify application of the Eighth Amendment. Cf. In re Gault, 387 U. S. 1 (1967). We have no occasion in this case, for example, to consider whether or under what circumstances persons involuntarily confined in mental or juvenile institutions can claim the protection of the Eighth Amendment. \n \n [Footnote 38] \n \n Judge Friendly similarly has observed that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause \n \n \"can fairly be deemed to be applicable to the manner in which an otherwise constitutional sentence . . . is carried out by an executioner, see Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U. S. 459 . . . (1947), or to cover conditions of confinement which my make intolerable an otherwise constitutional term of imprisonment.\" \n \n Johnson v. Glick, 481 F.2d 1028, 1032 (CA2), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1033 (1973) (citation omitted). \n \n [Footnote 39] \n \n Putting history aside as irrelevant, the dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE WHITE argues that a \"purposive analysis\" should control the reach of the Eighth Amendment. Post at 430 U. S. 686-688. There is no support whatever for this approach in the decisions of this Court. Although an imposition must be \"punishment\" for the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause to apply, the Court has never held that all punishments are subject to Eighth Amendment scrutiny. See n 40, infra. The applicability of the Eighth Amendment always has turned on its original meaning, as demonstrated by its historical derivation. See Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. at 428 U. S. 169-173 (joint opinion); Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. at 408 U. S. 315-328 (MARSHALL, J., concurring). \n \n The dissenting opinion warns that, as a consequence of our decision today, teachers may \"cut off a child's ear for being late to class.\" Post at 430 U. S. 684. This rhetoric bears no relation to reality or to the issues presented in this case. The laws of virtually every State forbid the excessive physical punishment of school children. Yet the logic of the dissent would make the judgment of which disciplinary punishments are reasonable and which are excessive a matter of constitutional principle in every case, to be decided ultimately by this Court. The hazards of such a broad reading of the Eighth Amendment are clear. \n \n \"It is always time to say that this Nation is too large, too complex and composed of too great a diversity of peoples for any one of us to have the wisdom to establish the rules by which local Americans must govern their local affairs. The constitutional rule we are urged to adopt is not merely revolutionary -- it departs from the ancient faith based on the premise that experience in making local laws by local people themselves is by far the safest guide for a nation like ours to follow.\" \n \n Powell v. Texas, 392 U. S. 514, 392 U. S. 547-548 (1968) (opinion of Black, J.). \n \n [Footnote 40] \n \n Eighth Amendment scrutiny is appropriate only after the State has complied with the constitutional guarantees traditionally associated with criminal prosecutions. See United States v. Lovett, 328 U. S. 303, 328 U. S. 317-318 (1946). Thus, in Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86 (1958), the plurality appropriately took the view that denationalization was an impermissible punishment for wartime desertion under the Eighth Amendment, because desertion already had been established at a criminal trial. But in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144 (1963), where the Court considered denationalization as a punishment for evading the draft, the Court refused to reach the Eighth Amendment issue, holding instead that the punishment could be imposed only through the criminal process. Id. at 372 U. S. 162-167, 372 U. S. 186, and n. 43. As these cases demonstrate, the State does not acquire the power to punish with which the Eighth Amendment is concerned until after it has secured a formal adjudication of guilt in accordance with due process of law. Where the State seeks to impose punishment without such an adjudication, the pertinent constitutional guarantee is the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n \n [Footnote 41] \n \n See 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *134. Under the 39th Article of the Magna Carta, an individual could not be deprived of this right of personal security \"except by the legal judgment of his peers or by the law of the land.\" Perry & Cooper, supra, n 33, at 17. By subsequent enactments of Parliament during the time of Edward III, the right was protected from deprivation except \"by due process of law.\" See Shattuck, The True Meaning of the Term \"Liberty,\" 4 Harv.L.Rev. 365, 372-373 (1891). \n \n [Footnote 42] \n \n See, e.g., Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U. S. 535, 316 U. S. 541 (1942) (sterilization); Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U. S. 11 (1905) (vaccination); Union Pacific R. Co. v. Botsford, 141 U. S. 250, 141 U. S. 251-252 (1891) (physical examinations); cf. ICC v. Brimson, 154 U. S. 447, 154 U. S. 479 (1894). \n \n The right of personal security is also protected by the Fourth Amendment, which was made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth because its protection was viewed as \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty' . . . enshrined in the history and the basic constitutional documents of English-speaking peoples.\" Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25, 338 U. S. 27-28 (1949). It has been said of the Fourth Amendment that its \"overriding function . . . is to protect personal privacy and dignity against unwarranted intrusion by the State.\" Schmerber v. California, 384 U. S. 757, 384 U. S. 767 (1966). But the principal concern of that Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures is with intrusions on privacy in the course of criminal investigations. See Whalen v. Roe, 429 U. S. 589, 429 U. S. 604 n. 32 (1977). Petitioners do not contend that the Fourth Amendment applies, according to its terms, to corporal punishment in public school. \n \n [Footnote 43] \n \n Unlike Goss v. Lopez, 419 U. S. 565 (1975), this case does not involve the state-created property interest in public education. The purpose of corporal punishment is to correct a child's behavior without interrupting his education. That corporal punishment may, in a rare case, have the unintended effect of temporarily removing a child from school affords no basis for concluding that the practice itself deprives students of property protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. \n \n Nor does this case involve any state-created interest in liberty going beyond the Fourteenth Amendment's protection of freedom from bodily restraint and corporal punishment. Cf. Meachum v. Fano, 427 U. S. 215, 427 U. S. 225-227 (1976). \n \n [Footnote 44] \n \n If the common law privilege to inflict reasonable corporal punishment in school were inapplicable, it is doubtful whether any procedure short of a trial in a criminal or juvenile court could satisfy the requirements of procedural due process for the imposition of such punishment. See United States v. Lovett, 328 U.S. at 328 U. S. 317-318; cf. Breed v. Jones, 421 U. S. 519, 421 U. S. 528-529 (1975). \n \n [Footnote 45] \n \n See supra at 430 U. S. 655-657, 430 U. S. 661. The statutory prohibition against \"degrading\" or unnecessarily \"severe\" corporal punishment in former \u00a7 232.27 has been construed as a statement of the common law principle. See 1937 Op.Fla.Atty.Gen., Biennial Report of the Atty.Gen. 169 (1937-1938); cf. 1957 Op.Fla.Atty.Gen., Biennial Report of the Atty.Gen. 7, 8 (1957-1958). Florida Stat.Ann. \u00a7 827.03(3) (1976) makes malicious punishment of a child a felony. Both the District Court, App. 144, and the Court of Appeals, 525 F.2d at 915, expressed the view that the common law tort remedy was available to the petitioners in this case. And petitioners conceded in this Court that a teacher who inflicts excessive punishment on a child may be held both civilly and criminally liable under Florida law. Brief for Petitioners 33 n. 11, 34; Tr. of Oral Arg. 17, 52-53. \n \n In view of the statutory adoption of the common law rule, and the unanimity of the parties and the courts below, the doubts expressed in MR. JUSTICE WHITE's dissenting opinion as to the availability of tort remedies in Florida can only be viewed as chimerical. The dissent makes much of the fact that no Florida court has ever \"recognized\" a damages remedy for unreasonable corporal punishment. Post at 430 U. S. 694 n. 11, 430 U. S. 700. But the absence of reported Florida decisions hardly suggests that no remedy is available. Rather, it merely confirms the common sense judgment that excessive corporal punishment is exceedingly rare in the public schools. \n \n [Footnote 46] \n \n The low incidence of abuse, and the availability of established judicial remedies in the event of abuse, distinguish this case from Goss v. Lopez, 419 U. S. 565 (1975). The Ohio law struck down in Goss provided for suspensions from public school of up to 10 days without \"any written procedure applicable to suspensions.\" Id. at 419 U. S. 567. Although Ohio law provided generally for administrative review, Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 2506.01 (Supp. 1973), the Court assumed that the short suspensions would not be stayed pending review, with the result that the review proceeding could serve neither a deterrent nor a remedial function. 419 U.S. at 419 U. S. 581 n. 10. In these circumstances, the Court held the law authorizing suspensions unconstitutional for failure to require \"that there be at least an informal give-and-take between student and disciplinarian, preferably prior to the suspension. . . .\" Id. at 419 U. S. 584. The subsequent civil and criminal proceedings available in this case may be viewed as affording substantially greater protection to the child than the informal conference mandated by Goss. \n \n [Footnote 47] \n \n \"[P]rior hearings might well be dispensed with in many circumstances in which the state's conduct, if not adequately justified, would constitute a common law tort. This would leave the injured plaintiff in precisely the same posture as a common law plaintiff, and this procedural consequence would be quite harmonious with the substantive view that the fourteenth amendment encompasses the same liberties as those protected by the common law.\" \n \n Monaghan, Of \"Liberty\" and \"Property,\" 62 Cornell L.Rev. 405, 431 (1977) (footnote omitted).

S. 659, and n. 12, to decide whether or under what circumstances corporal punishment of a public school child may give rise to an independent federal cause of action to vindicate substantive rights under the Due Process Clause. \n \n [Footnote 48] \n \n See also Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968). The reasonableness of a warrantless public arrest may be subjected to subsequent judicial scrutiny in a civil action against the law enforcement officer or in a suppression hearing to determine whether any evidence seized in the arrest may be used in a criminal trial. \n \n [Footnote 49] \n \n \"[P]rocedural due process rules are shaped by the risk of error inherent in the truthfinding process as applied to the generality of cases, not the rare exceptions. . . .\" \n \n Mathews v.

(Comm.Print 1977). \n \n [Footnote 54] \n \n The need to maintain order in a trial courtroom raises similar problems. In that context, this Court has recognized the power of the trial judge \"to punish summarily and without notice or hearing contemptuous conduct committed in his presence and observed by him.\" Taylor v. Hayes, 418 U. S. 488, 418 U. S. 497 (1974), citing Ex parte Terry, 128 U. S. 289 (1888). The punishment so imposed may be as severe as six months in prison. See Codispoti v. Pennsylvania, 418 U. S. 506, 418 U. S. 513-515 (1974); cf. Muniz v. Hoffman, 422 U. S. 454, 422 U. S. 475-476 (1975). \n \n [Footnote 55] \n \n MR. JUSTICE WHITE's dissenting opinion offers no manageable standards for determining what process is due in any particular case. The dissent apparently would require, as a general rule, only \"an informal give-and-take between student and disciplinarian.\" Post at 430 U. S. 693. But the dissent would depart from these \"minimal procedures\" -- requiring even witnesses, counsel, and cross-examination -- in cases where the punishment reaches some undefined level of severity. Post at 430 U. S. 700 n. 18. School authorities are left to guess at the degree of punishment that will require more than an \"informal give-and-take\" and at the additional process that may be constitutionally required. The impracticality of such an approach is self-evident, and illustrates the hazards of ignoring the traditional solution of the common law. \n \n We agree with the dissent that the Goss procedures will often be, \"if anything, less than a fair-minded school principal would impose upon himself.\" Post at 430 U. S. 700, quoting Goss, 419 U.S. at 419 U. S. 583. But before this Court invokes the Constitution to impose a procedural requirement, it should be reasonably certain that the effect will be to afford protection appropriate to the constitutional interests at stake. The dissenting opinion's reading of the Constitution suggests no such beneficial result and, indeed, invites a lowering of existing constitutional standards. \n \n MR. JUSTICE WHITE, with whom MR JUSTICE BRENNAN, MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, and MR. JUSTICE STEVENS join, dissenting. \n \n Today the Court holds that corporal punishment in public schools, no matter how severe, can never be the subject of the protections afforded by the Eighth Amendment. It also holds \n \n Page 430 U. S. 684 \n \n that students in the public school systems are not constitutionally entitled to a hearing of any sort before beatings can be inflicted on them. Because I believe that these holdings are inconsistent with the prior decisions of this Court and are contrary to a reasoned analysis of the constitutional provisions involved, I respectfully dissent. \n \n I \n \n A \n \n The Eighth Amendment places a flat prohibition against the infliction of \"cruel and unusual punishments.\" This reflects a societal judgment that there are some punishments that are so barbaric and inhumane that we will not permit them to be imposed on anyone, no matter how opprobrious the offense. See Robinson v. California, 370 U. S. 660, 370 U. S. 676 (1962) (Douglas, J., concurring). If there are some punishments that are so barbaric that they may not be imposed for the commission of crimes, designated by our social system as the most thoroughly reprehensible acts an individual can commit, then, a fortiori, similar punishments may not be imposed on persons for less culpable acts, such as breaches of school discipline. Thus, if it is constitutionally impermissible to cut off someone's ear for the commission of murder, it must be unconstitutional to cut off a child's ear for being late to class. [Footnote 2/1] Although there were no ears cut off in this case, the \n \n Page 430 U. S. 685 \n \n record reveals beatings so severe that, if they were inflicted on a hardened criminal for the commission of a serious crime, they might not pass constitutional muster. \n \n Nevertheless, the majority holds that the Eighth Amendment \"was designed to protect [only] those convicted of crimes,\" ante at 430 U. S. 664, relying on a vague and inconclusive recitation of the history of the Amendment. Yet the constitutional prohibition is against cruel and unusual punishments; nowhere is that prohibition limited or modified by the language of the Constitution. Certainly, the fact that the Framers did not choose to insert the word \"criminal\" into the language of the Eighth Amendment is strong evidence that the Amendment was designed to prohibit all inhumane or barbaric punishments, no matter what the nature of the offense for which the punishment is imposed. \n \n No one can deny that spanking of school children is \"punishment\" under any reasonable reading of the word, for the similarities between spanking in public schools and other forms of punishment are too obvious to ignore. Like other forms of punishment, spanking of school children involves an institutionalized response to the violation of some official rule or regulation proscribing certain conduct and is imposed \n \n Page 430 U. S. 686 \n \n for the purpose of rehabilitating the offender, deterring the offender and others like him from committing the violation in the future, and inflicting some measure of social retribution for the harm that has been done. \n \n B \n \n We are fortunate that, in our society, punishments that are severe enough to raise a doubt as to their constitutional validity are ordinarily not imposed without first affording the accused the full panoply of procedural safeguards provided by the criminal process. [Footnote 2/2] The effect has been that \n \n \"every decision of this Court considering whether a punishment is 'cruel and unusual' within the meaning of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments has dealt with a criminal punishment.\" \n \n Ante at 430 U. S. 666. The Court would have us believe from this fact that there is a recognized distinction between criminal and noncriminal punishment for purposes of the Eighth Amendment. This is plainly wrong. \"[E]ven a clear legislative classification of a statute as non-penal' would not alter the fundamental nature of a plainly penal statute.\" Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 356 U. S. 95 (1958) (plurality opinion). The relevant inquiry is not whether the offense for which a punishment is inflicted has been labeled as criminal, but whether the purpose of the deprivation is among those ordinarily associated \n \n Page 430 U. S. 687 \n \n with punishment, such as retribution, rehabilitation, or deterrence. [Footnote 2/3] Id. at 356 U. S. 96. Cf. Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144 (1963) \n \n If this purposive approach were followed in the present case, it would be clear that spanking in the Florida public schools is punishment within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment. The District Court found that \n \n \"[c]orporal punishment is one of a variety of measures employed in the school system for the correction of pupil behavior and the preservation of order.\" \n \n App 146. Behavior correction and \n \n Page 430 U. S. 688 \n \n preservation of order are purposes ordinarily associated with punishment. \n \n Without even mentioning the purposive analysis applied in the prior decisions of this Court, the majority adopts a rule that turns on the label given to the offense for which the punishment is inflicted. Thus, the record in this case reveals that one student at Drew Junior High School received 50 licks with a paddle for allegedly making an obscene telephone call. Brief for Petitioners 13. The majority holds that the Eighth Amendment does not prohibit such punishment, since it was only inflicted for a breach of school discipline. However, that same conduct is punishable as a misdemeanor under Florida law, Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 365.18 (Supp. 177), and there can be little doubt that, if that same \"punishment\" had been inflicted by an officer of the state courts for violation of \u00a7 365.16, it would have had to satisfy the requirements of the Eighth Amendment. \n \n C \n \n In fact, as the Court recognizes, the Eighth Amendment has never been confined to criminal punishments. [Footnote 2/4] Nevertheless, the majority adheres to its view that any protections afforded by the Eighth Amendment must have something to do with \n \n Page 430 U. S. 689 \n \n criminals, and it would therefore confine any exceptions to its general rule that only criminal punishments are covered by the Eighth Amendment to abuses inflicted on prisoners. Thus, if a prisoner is beaten mercilessly for a breach of discipline, he is entitled to the protection of the Eighth Amendment, while a school child who commits the same breach of discipline and is similarly beaten is simply not covered. \n \n The purported explanation of this anomaly is the assertion that school children have no need for the Eighth Amendment. We are told that schools are open institutions, subject to constant public scrutiny; that school children have adequate remedies under state law; [Footnote 2/5] and that prisoners suffer the social stigma of being labeled as criminals. How any of these policy considerations got into the Constitution is difficult to discern, for the Court has never considered any of these factors in determining the scope of the Eighth Amendment. [Footnote 2/6] \n \n Page 430 U. S. 690 \n \n The essence of the majority's argument is that school children do not need Eighth Amendment protection, because corporal punishment is less subject to abuse in the public schools than it is in the prison system. [Footnote 2/7] However, it cannot be reasonably suggested that, just because cruel and unusual punishments may occur less frequently under public scrutiny, they will not occur at all. The mere fact that a public flogging or a public execution would be available for all to see would not render the punishment constitutional if it were otherwise impermissible. Similarly, the majority would not suggest that a prisoner who is placed in a minimum security prison and permitted to go home to his family on the weekends should be any less entitled to Eighth Amendment protections than his counterpart in a maximum security prison. In short, if a punishment is so barbaric and inhumane that it goes beyond the tolerance of a civilized society, its openness to public scrutiny should have nothing to do with its constitutional validity. \n \n Nor is it an adequate answer that school children may have other state and constitutional remedies available to them. Even assuming that the remedies available to public school students are adequate under Florida law, [Footnote 2/8] the availability of state remedies has never been determinative of the coverage or of the protections afforded by the Eighth Amendment. The reason is obvious. The fact that a person may have a \n \n Page 430 U. S. 691 \n \n state law cause of action against a public official who tortures him with a thumbscrew for the commission of an antisocial act has nothing to do with the fact that such official conduct is cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. Indeed, the majority's view was implicitly rejected this Term in Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97 (1976), when the Court held that failure to provide for the medical needs of prisoners could constitute cruel and unusual punishment even though a medical malpractice remedy in tort was available to prisoners under state law. Id. at 429 U. S. 107 n. 15. \n \n D \n \n By holding that the Eighth Amendment protects only criminals, the majority adopts the view that one is entitled to the protections afforded by the Eighth Amendment only if he is punished for acts that are sufficiently opprobrious for society to make them \"criminal.\" This is a curious holding in view of the fact that the more culpable the offender, the more likely it is that the punishment will not be disproportionate to the offense, and consequently, the less likely it is that the punishment will be cruel and unusual. [Footnote 2/9] Conversely, a public school student who is spanked for a mere breach of discipline may sometimes have a strong argument that the punishment does not fit the offense, depending upon the severity of the beating, and therefore that it is cruel and unusual. Yet the majority would afford the student no protection no matter how inhumane and barbaric the punishment inflicted on him might be. \n \n The issue presented in this phase of the case is limited to whether corporal punishment in public schools can ever be prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. I am therefore not \n \n Page 430 U. S. 692 \n \n suggesting that spanking in the public schools is, in every instance, prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. My own view is that it is not. I only take issue with the extreme view of the majority that corporal punishment in public schools, no matter how barbaric, inhumane, or severe, is never limited by the Eighth Amendment. Where corporal punishment becomes so severe as to be unacceptable in a civilized society, I can see no reason that it should become any more acceptable just because it is inflicted on children in the public schools. \n \n II \n \n The majority concedes that corporal punishment in the public schools implicates an interest protected by the Due Process Clause -- the liberty interest of the student to be free from \"bodily restraint and punishment\" involving \"appreciable physical pain\" inflicted by persons acting under color of state law. Ante at 430 U. S. 674. The question remaining, as the majority recognizes, is what process is due. \n \n The reason that the Constitution requires a State to provide \"due process of law\" when it punishes an individual for misconduct is to protect the individual from erroneous or mistaken punishment that the State would not have inflicted had it found the facts in a more reliable way. See, e.g., Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 424 U. S. 335, 344 (1976). In Goss v. Lopez, 419 U. S. 565 (1975), the Court applied this principle to the school disciplinary process, holding that a student must be given an informal opportunity to be heard before he is finally suspended from public school. \n \n \"Disciplinarians, although proceeding in utmost good faith, frequently act on the reports and advice of others, and the controlling facts and the nature of the conduct under challenge are often disputed. The risk of error is not at all trivial, and it should be guarded against if that may be done without prohibitive cost or interference \n \n Page 430 U. S. 693 \n \n with the educational process.\" \n \n Id. at 419 U. S. 580. (Emphasis added.) To guard against this risk of punishing an innocent child, the Due Process Clause requires not an \"elaborate hearing\" before a neutral party, but simply \"an informal give-and-take between student and disciplinarian\" which gives the student \"an opportunity to explain his version of the facts.\" Id. at 419 U. S. 580, 419 U. S. 582, 419 U. S. 584. \n \n The Court now holds that these \"rudimentary precautions against unfair or mistaken findings of misconduct,\" id. at 419 U. S. 581, are not required if the student is punished with \"appreciable physical pain,\" rather than with a suspension, even though both punishments deprive the student of a constitutionally protected interest. Although the respondent school authorities provide absolutely no process to the student before the punishment is finally inflicted, the majority concludes that the student is nonetheless given due process because he can later sue the teacher and recover damages if the punishment was \"excessive.\" \n \n This tort action is utterly inadequate to protect against erroneous infliction of punishment for two reasons. [Footnote 2/10] First, under Florida law, a student punished for an act he did not commit cannot recover damages from a teacher \"proceeding \n \n Page 430 U. S. 694 \n \n in utmost good faith . . . on the reports and advice of others,\" supra at 430 U. S. 692; the student has no remedy at all for punishment imposed on the basis of mistaken facts, at least as long as the punishment was reasonable from the point of view of the disciplinarian, uninformed by any prior hearing. [Footnote 2/11] The \"traditional \n \n Page 430 U. S. 695 \n \n common law remedies\" on which the majority relies, ante at 430 U. S. 672, thus do nothing to protect the student from the danger that concerned the Court in Goss -- the risk of reasonable, good faith mistake in the school disciplinary process. \n \n Second, and more important, even if the student could sue for good faith error in the infliction of punishment, the lawsuit occurs after the punishment has been finally imposed. The infliction of physical pain is final and irreparable; it cannot be undone in a subsequent proceeding. There is every reason to require, as the Court did in Goss, a few minutes of \"informal give-and-take between student and disciplinarian\" \n \n Page 430 U. S. 696 \n \n as a \"meaningful hedge\" against the erroneous infliction of irreparable injury. 419 U.S. at 419 U. S. 583-584. [Footnote 2/12] \n \n The majority's conclusion that a damages remedy for excessive corporal punishment affords adequate process rests on the novel theory that the State may punish an individual without giving him any opportunity to present his side of the story, as long as he can later recover damages from a state official if he is innocent. The logic of this theory would permit a State that punished speeding with a one-day jail sentence to make a driver serve his sentence first without a trial and then sue to recover damages for wrongful imprisonment. [Footnote 2/13] Similarly, the State could finally take away a prisoner's good-time credits for alleged disciplinary infractions and require him to bring a damages suit after he was eventually released. There is no authority for this theory, nor does the majority purport to find any, [Footnote 2/14] in the procedural due process \n \n Page 430 U. S. 697 \n \n decisions of this Court. Those cases have \n \n \"consistently held that some kind of hearing is required at some time before a person is finally deprived of his property interests . . . , [and that] a person's liberty is equally protected. . . .\" \n \n Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539, 418 U. S. 557-558 (1974). (Emphasis added.) \n \n The majority attempts to support its novel theory by drawing an analogy to warrantless arrests on probable cause, which the Court has held reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. United States v. Watson, 423 U. S. 411 (1976). This analogy fails for two reasons. First, the particular requirements of the Fourth Amendment, rooted in the \"ancient common law rule[s]\" regulating police practices, id. at 423 U. S. 418, must be understood in the context of the criminal justice system for which that Amendment was explicitly tailored. Thus, in Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S. 103 (1975), the Court, speaking through MR. JUSTICE POWELL, rejected the argument that procedural protections required in Goss and other due process \n \n Page 430 U. S. 698 \n \n cases should be afforded to a criminal suspect arrested without a warrant. \n \n \"The Fourth Amendment was tailored explicitly for the criminal justice system, and its balance between individual and public interests always has been thought to define the 'process that is due' for seizures of person or property in criminal cases, including the detention of suspects pending trial. . . . Moreover, the Fourth Amendment probable cause determination is, in fact, only the first stage of an elaborate system, unique in jurisprudence, designed to safeguard the rights of those accused of criminal conduct. The relatively simple civil procedures (e.g., prior interview with school principal before suspension) presented in the [procedural due process] cases cited in the concurring opinion are inapposite and irrelevant in the wholly different context of the criminal justice system.\" \n \n Id. at 420 U. S. 125 n. 27. (Emphasis in last sentence added.) While a case dealing with warrantless arrests is perhaps not altogether \"inapposite and irrelevant in the wholly different context\" of the school disciplinary process, such a case is far weaker authority than procedural due process cases such as Goss v. Lopez, 419 U. S. 565 (1975), that deal with deprivations of liberty outside the criminal context. \n \n Second, contrary to the majority's suggestion, ante at 430 U. S. 680 n. 48, the reason that the Court has upheld warrantless arrests on probable cause is not because the police officer's assessment of the facts \"may be subjected to subsequent judicial scrutiny in a civil action against the law enforcement officer or in a suppression hearing. . . .\" The reason that the Court has upheld arrests without warrants is that they are the \"first stage of an elaborate system\" of procedural protections, Gerstein v. Pugh, supra at 420 U. S. 125 n. 27, and that the State is not free to continue the deprivation beyond this first stage without procedures. The Constitution requires the State to provide \n \n Page 430 U. S. 699 \n \n \"a fair and reliable determination of probable cause\" by a judicial officer prior to the imposition of \"any significant pretrial restraint of liberty\" other than \"a brief period of detention to take the administrative steps incident to [a warrantless] arrest.\" Id. at 420 U. S. 114, 420 U. S. 125. (Footnote omitted; emphasis added.) This \"practical compromise\" is made necessary because \n \n \"requiring a magistrate's review of the factual justification prior to any arrest . . . would constitute an intolerable handicap for legitimate law enforcement,\" \n \n id. at 420 U. S. 113; but it is the probable cause determination prior to any significant period of pretrial incarceration, rather than a damages action or suppression hearing, that affords the suspect due process. \n \n There is, in short, no basis in logic or authority for the majority's suggestion that an action to recover damages for excessive corporal punishment \"afford[s] substantially greater protection to the child than the informal conference mandated by Goss.\" [Footnote 2/15] The majority purports to follow the settled principle that what process is due depends on \n \n \"'the risk of an erroneous deprivation of [the protected] interest . . . and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards;' [Footnote 2/16]\" \n \n it recognizes, as did Goss, the risk of error in the school disciplinary process [Footnote 2/17] and concedes that \"the child has a strong interest in procedural safeguards that minimize the risk of wrongful punishment . . . ,\" ante at 430 U. S. 676; \n \n Page 430 U. S. 700 \n \n but it somehow concludes that this risk is adequately reduced by a damages remedy that never has been recognized by a Florida court, that leaves unprotected the innocent student punished by mistake, and that allows the State to punish first and hear the student's version of events later. I cannot agree. \n \n The majority emphasizes, as did the dissenters in Goss, that even the \"rudimentary precautions\" required by that decision would impose some burden on the school disciplinary process. But those costs are no greater if the student is paddled, rather than suspended; the risk of error in the punishment is no smaller; and the fear of \"a significant intrusion\" into the disciplinary process, ante at 430 U. S. 682 (cf. Goss, supra at 419 U. S. 585 (POWELL, J., dissenting)), is just as exaggerated. The disciplinarian need only take a few minutes to give the student \n \n \"notice of the charges against him and, if he denies them, an explanation of the evidence the authorities have and an opportunity to present his side of the story.\" \n \n 419 U.S. at 419 U. S. 581. In this context, the Constitution requires, \"if anything, less than a fair-minded school principal would impose upon himself\" in order to avoid injustice. [Footnote 2/18] Id. at 419 U. S. 583. \n \n I would reverse the judgment below. \n \n [Footnote 2/1] \n \n There is little reason to fear that, if the Eighth Amendment is held to apply at all to corporal punishment of school children, all paddlings, however moderate, would be prohibited. Jackson v. Bishop, 404 F.2d 571 (CA8 1968), held that any paddling or flogging of prisoners, convicted of crime and serving prison terms, violated the cruel and unusual punishment ban of the Eighth Amendment. But aside from the fact that Bishop has never been embraced by this Court, the theory of that case was not that bodily punishments are intrinsically barbaric or excessively severe, but that paddling of prisoners is \"degrading to the punisher and to the punished alike.\" Id. at 580. That approach may be acceptable in the criminal justice system, but it has little if any relevance to corporal punishment in the schools, for it can hardly be said that the use of moderate paddlings in the discipline of children is inconsistent with the country's evolving standards of decency. \n \n On the other hand, when punishment involves a cruel, severe beating or chopping off an ear, something more than merely the dignity of the individual is involved. Whenever a given criminal punishment is \"cruel and unusual\" because it is inhumane or barbaric, I can think of no reason why it would be any less inhumane or barbaric when inflicted on a school child, as punishment for classroom misconduct. \n \n The issue in this case is whether spankings inflicted on public school children for breaking school rules is \"punishment,\" not whether such punishment is \"cruel and unusual.\" If the Eighth Amendment does not bar moderate spanking in public schools, it is because moderate spanking is not \"cruel and unusual,\" not because it is not \"punishment\" as the majority suggests. \n \n [Footnote 2/2] \n \n By no means is it suggested that just because spanking of school children is \"punishment\" within the meaning of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, the school disciplinary process is in any way \"criminal,\" and therefore subject to the full panoply of criminal procedural guarantees. See 430 U. S. infra. Ordinarily, the conduct for which school children are punished is not sufficiently opprobrious to be called \"criminal\" in our society, and even violations of school disciplinary rules that might also constitute a crime, see infra at 430 U. S. 688, are not subject to the criminal process. See Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U. S. 308 (1976), where the Court held that persons who violate prison disciplinary rules are not entitled to the full panoply of criminal procedural safeguards, even if the rule violation might also constitute a crime. \n \n [Footnote 2/3] \n \n The majority cites Trop as one of the cases that \"dealt with a criminal punishment,\" but neglects to follow the analysis mandated by that decision. In Trop, the petitioner was convicted of desertion by a military court-martial and sentenced to three years at hard labor, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and a dishonorable discharge. After he was punished for the offense he committed, petitioner's application for a passport was turned down. Petitioner was told that he had been deprived of the \"rights of citizenship\" under \u00a7 401(g) of the Nationality Act of 1940 because he had been dishonorably discharged from the Armed Forces. The plurality took the view that denationalization in this context was cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. \n \n The majority would have us believe that the determinative factor in Trop was that the petitioner had been convicted of desertion; yet there is no suggestion in Trop that the disposition of the military court-martial had anything to do with the decision in that case. Instead, while recognizing that the Eighth Amendment extends only to punishments that are penal in nature, the plurality adopted a purposive approach for determining when punishment is penal. \n \n \"In deciding whether or not a law is penal, this Court has generally based its determination upon the purpose of the statute. If the statute imposes a disability for the purposes of punishment -- that is, to reprimand the wrongdoer, to deter others, etc. -- it has been considered penal. But a statute has been considered nonpenal if it imposes a disability not to punish, but to accomplish some other legitimate governmental purpose.\" \n \n 356 U.S. at 356 U. S. 96 (footnotes omitted). Although the quoted passage is taken from the plurality opinion of Mr Chief Justice Warren, joined by three other Justices, MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, in a concurring opinion, adopted a similar approach in concluding that \u00a7 401(g) was beyond the power of Congress to enact. \n \n [Footnote 2/4] \n \n Ante at 430 U. S. 669. In Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97 (1976), a case decided this Term, the Court held that \"deliberate indifference to the medical needs of prisoners\" by prison officials constitutes cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. Such deliberate indifference to a prisoner's medical needs clearly is not punishment inflicted for the commission of a crime; it is merely misconduct by a prison official. Similarly, the Eighth Circuit has held that whipping a prisoner with a strap in order to maintain discipline is prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. Jackson v. Bishop, 404 F.2d 571 (1968) (Blackmun, J.). See also Knecht v. Gillman, 488 F.2d 1136, 1139-1140 (CA8 1973) (injection of vomit-inducing drugs as part of aversion therapy held to be cruel and unusual); Vann v. Scott, 467 F.2d 1235, 1241241 (CA7 1972) (Stevens, J.) (Eighth Amendment protects runaway children against cruel and inhumane treatment, regardless of whether such treatment is labeled \"rehabilitation\" or \"punishment\"). \n \n [Footnote 2/5] \n \n By finding that bodily punishment invades a constitutionally protected liberty interest within the meaning of the Due Process Clause, the majority suggests that the Clause might also afford a remedy for excessive spanking independently of the Eighth Amendment. If this were the case, the Court's present thesis would have little practical significance. If, rather than holding that the Due Process Clause affords a remedy by way of the express commands of the Eighth Amendment, the majority would recognize a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for a deprivation of \"liberty\" flowing from an excessive paddling, the Court's opinion is merely a lengthy word of advice with respect to the drafting of civil complaints. \n \n Petitioners in this case did raise the substantive due process issue in their petition for certiorari, ante at 430 U. S. 659 n. 12, but consideration of that question was foreclosed by our limited grant of certiorari. If it is probable that school children would be entitled to protection under some theory of substantive due process, the Court should not now affirm the judgment below, but should amend the grant of certiorari and set this case for reargument. \n \n [Footnote 2/6] \n \n In support of its policy considerations, the only cases from this Court cited by the majority are Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U. S. 471 (1972), and Meachum v. Fano, 427 U. S. 215 (1976), both cases involving prisoners' rights to procedural due process. \n \n [Footnote 2/7] \n \n There is no evidence in the record that corporal punishment has been abused in the prison systems more often than in the public schools. Indeed, corporal punishment is seldom authorized in state prisons. See Jackson v. Bishop, supra at 580, where MR. JUSTICE (then Judge) BLACKMUN noted: \"[O]nly two states still permit the use of the strap [in prisons]. Thus almost uniformly has it been abolished.\" By relying on its own view of the nature of these two public institutions, without any evidence being heard on the question below, the majority today predicates a constitutional principle on mere armchair speculation. \n \n [Footnote 2/8] \n \n There is some doubt that the state law remedies available to public school children are adequate. See n. 11, infra. \n \n [Footnote 2/9] \n \n For a penalty to be consistent with the Eighth Amendment \"the punishment must not be grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime.\" Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 428 U. S. 173 (1976) (joint opinion of STEWART, POWELL, and STEVENS, JJ.). \n \n [Footnote 2/10] \n \n Here, as in Goss v. Lopez, 419 U. S. 565, 419 U. S. 580-581, n. 9 (1975), the record suggests that there may be a substantial risk of error in the discipline administered by respondent school authorities. Respondents concede that some of the petitioners who were punished \"denied misconduct,\" and that, \"in some cases, the punishments may have been mistaken. . . .\" Brief for Respondents 60-61. The Court of Appeals panel below noted numerous instances of students punished despite claims of innocence, 498 F.2d 248, 256-258 (CA5 1974), and was \"particularly disturbed by the testimony that whole classes of students were corporally punished for the misconduct of a few.\" Id. at 268 n. 36. To the extent that the majority focuses on the incidence of and remedies for unduly severe punishments, it fails to address petitioners' claim that procedural safeguards are required to reduce the risk of punishments that are simply mistaken. \n \n [Footnote 2/11] \n \n The majority's assurances to the contrary, it is unclear to me whether and to what extent Florida law provides a damages action against school officials for excessive corporal punishment. Giving the majority the benefit of every doubt, I think it is fair to say that the most a student punished on the basis of mistaken allegations of misconduct can hope for in Florida is a recovery for unreasonable or bad faith error. But I strongly suspect that even this remedy is not available. \n \n Although the majority does not cite a single case decided under Florida law that recognizes a student's right to sue a school official to recover damages for excessive punishment, I am willing to assume that such a tort action does exist in Florida. I nevertheless have serious doubts about whether it would ever provide a recovery to a student simply because he was punished for an offense he did not commit. All the cases in other jurisdictions cited by the majority, ante at 430 U. S. 663 n. 28, involved allegations of punishment disproportionate to the misconduct with which the student was charged; none of the decisions even suggest that a student could recover by showing that the teacher incorrectly imposed punishment for something the student had not done. The majority appears to agree that the damages remedy is available only in cases of punishment unreasonable in light of the misconduct charged. It states: \n \n \"In those cases where severe punishment is contemplated, the available civil and criminal sanctions for abuse . . . afford significant protection against unjustified corporal punishment.\" \n \n Ante at 430 U. S. 678. (Emphasis added.) \n \n Even if the common law remedy for excessive punishment extends to punishment that is \"excessive\" only in the sense that it is imposed on the basis of mistaken facts, the school authorities are still protected from personal liability by common law immunity. (They are protected by statutory immunity for liability for enforcing disciplinary rules \"[e]xcept in the case of excessive force or cruel and unusual punishment.\" Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 232.275 (1976).) At a minimum, this immunity would protect school officials from damages liability for reasonable mistakes made in good faith. \n \n \"Although there have been differing emphases and formulations of the common law immunity of public school officials in cases of student expulsion or suspension, state courts have generally recognized that such officers should be protected from tort liability under state law for all good faith, nonmalicious action taken to fulfill their official duties.\" \n \n Wood v. Strickland, 420 U. S. 308, 420 U. S. 318 (1975) (adopting this rule for \u00a7 1983 suits involving school discipline) (footnote omitted); see id. at 420 U. S. 318 n. 9 (citing state cases). Florida has applied this rule to a police officer's determination of probable cause to arrest; the officer is not liable in damages for an arrest not based on probable cause if the officer reasonably believed that probable cause existed. Miami v. Albro, 120 So.2d 23, 26 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1960); cf. Middleton v. Fort Walton Beach, 113 So.2d 431 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1959) (police officer would be personally liable for intentional tort of making an arrest pursuant to warrant he knew to be void); Wilson v. O'Neal, 118 So.2d 101 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1960) (law enforcement officer not liable in damages for obtaining an arrest warrant on the basis of an incorrect identification). There is every reason to think that the Florida courts would apply a similar immunity standard in a hypothetical damages suit against a school disciplinarian. \n \n A final limitation on the student's damages remedy under Florida law is that the student can recover only from the personal assets of the official; the school board's treasury is absolutely protected by sovereign immunity from damages for the torts of its agents. Buck v. McLean, 115 So.2d 764 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1959). A teacher's limited resources may deter the jury from awarding, or prevent the student from collecting, the full amount of damages to which he is entitled. Cf. Bonner v. Coughlin, 517 F.2d 1311, 1319 n. 23 (CA7 1975), modified en banc, 545 F.2d 565 (1976), cert pending, No. 76-6204 (state law remedy affords due process where no sovereign or official immunity bars tort suit for negligence by prison guard). \n \n [Footnote 2/12] \n \n Cf. G. M. Leasing Corp. v. United States, 429 U. S. 338, 429 U. S. 351-359 (1977). The Court there held that, in levying on a taxpayer's assets pursuant to a jeopardy assessment, revenue agents must obtain a warrant before searching the taxpayer's office, but not before seizing his property in a manner that involves no invasion of privacy. G. M. Leasing thus reflects the principle that the case for advance procedural safeguards (such as a magistrate's determination of probable cause) is more compelling when the Government finally inflicts an injury that cannot be repaired in a subsequent judicial proceeding (invasion of privacy) than when it inflicts a temporary injury which can be undone (seizure of property). The infliction of bodily punishment, like the invasion of privacy, presents this most compelling case for advance procedural safeguards \n \n [Footnote 2/13] \n \n To the extent that the majority attempts to find \"a relevant analogy in the criminal law\" -- warrantless arrests on probable cause -- to its holding here, ante at 430 U. S. 679-680 (and see infra at 430 U. S. 697-699), it has chosen the wrong analogy. If the majority forthrightly applied its present due process analysis to the area of criminal prosecutions, the police officer not only could arrest a suspect without a warrant, but also could convict the suspect without a trial and sentence him to a short jail term. The accused would get his due process in a tort suit for false imprisonment. \n \n [Footnote 2/14] \n \n For the proposition that the need for a prior hearing is \"significantly less compelling\" where the State has preserved \"common law remedies,\" ante at 430 U. S. 679, 430 U. S. 678, the majority cites only one case, Bonner v. Coughlin, supra, dismissing an allegation by a prisoner that prison guards acting under color of state law had deprived him of property without due process of law by negligently failing to close the door of his cell after a search, with the foreseeable consequence that his trial transcript was stolen. The panel held that the right to recover under state law for the negligence of state employees provided the prisoner with due process of law. The decision is distinguishable from the instant case on two grounds. First, recovery was not barred by sovereign or official immunity, and the state remedy ensured that the prisoner would be \"made whole for any loss of property.\" 517 F.2d at 1319, and n. 23. Cf. Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U. S. 102, 419 U. S. 156 (1974). The point here, of course, is that the student cannot be made whole for the infliction of wrongful punishment. Second, the State cannot hold a pre-deprivation hearing where it does not intend to inflict the deprivation; the best it can do to protect the individual from an unauthorized and inadvertent act is to provide a damages remedy. 517 F.2d at 1319 n. 25. Here, the deprivation is intentional, and a prior hearing altogether feasible. \n \n [Footnote 2/15] \n \n Ante at 430 U. S. 678 n. 46. \n \n [Footnote 2/16] \n \n Ante at 430 U. S. 675, quoting Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 424 U. S. 335 (1976). \n \n [Footnote 2/17] \n \n Ante at 430 U. S. 676, quoting Goss, 419 U.S. at 419 U. S. 579-580. Elsewhere in its opinion the majority asserts that the risk of error is \"typically insignificant\" because \"paddlings are usually inflicted in response to conduct directly observed by teachers in their presence.\" Ante at 430 U. S. 677-678. But it cites no finding or evidence in the record for this assertion, and there is no such restriction in the statute or regulations authorizing corporal punishment. See ante at 430 U. S. 655 n. 6, 430 U. S. 656 n. 7. Indeed, the panel below noted specific instances in which students were punished by an assistant to the principal who was not present when the alleged offenses were committed. 498 F.2d at 257, 259. \n \n [Footnote 2/18] \n \n My view here expressed that the minimal procedures of Goss are required for any corporal punishment implicating the student's liberty interest is, of course, not meant to imply that this minimum would be constitutionally sufficient no matter how severe the punishment inflicted. The Court made this reservation explicit in Goss by suggesting that more elaborate procedures such as witnesses, counsel, and cross-examination might well be required for suspensions longer than the 10-day maximum involved in that case. 419 U.S. at 419 U. S. 583-584. A similar caveat is appropriate here. \n \n MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting. \n \n MR. JUSTICE WHITE's analysis of the Eighth Amendment issue is, I believe, unanswerable. I am also persuaded that his analysis of the procedural due process issue is correct. Notwithstanding my disagreement with the Court's holding \n \n Page 430 U. S. 701 \n \n on the latter question, my respect for MR. JUSTICE POWELL's reasoning in 430 U. S. \n \n The constitutional prohibition of state deprivations of life, liberty, or property without due process of law does not, by its express language, require that a hearing be provided before any deprivation may occur. To be sure, the timing of the process may be a critical element in determining its adequacy -- that is, in deciding what process is due in a particular context. Generally, adequate notice and a fair opportunity to be heard in advance of any deprivation of a constitutionally protected interest are essential. The Court has recognized, however, that the wording of the command that there shall be no deprivation \"without\" due process of law is consistent with the conclusion that a post-deprivation remedy is sometimes constitutionally sufficient. [Footnote 3/1] \n \n When only an invasion of a property interest is involved, there is a greater likelihood that a damages award will make a person completely whole than when an invasion of the individual's interest in freedom from bodily restraint and punishment has occurred. In the property context, therefore, frequently a post-deprivation state remedy may be all the process that the Fourteenth Amendment requires. It may also be true -- although I do not express an opinion on the point -- that an adequate state remedy for defamation may satisfy the due process requirement when a State has impaired an individual's interest in his reputation. On that hypothesis, the Court's analysis today gives rise to the thought that Paul v. Davis, 424 U. S. 693, may have been correctly decided on an incorrect rationale. Perhaps the Court will one day \n \n Page 430 U. S. 702 \n \n agree with MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN s appraisal of the importance of the constitutional interest at stake in id. at 424 U. S. 720-723, 424 U. S. 734 (dissenting opinion), and nevertheless conclude that an adequate state remedy may prevent every state-inflicted injury to a person's reputation from violating 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.

She tied him to a bedpost with pantyhose and whipped him so badly with the cord from her iron that his stepfather had to take him to the hospital. \n \n On the way home, Langford said, his stepfather drove by the Birmingham jail to show him where all the other crooks went. \n \n Today Langford is in prison, having been convicted of federal corruption charges after he took money, clothes and jewelry in exchange for Jefferson County bond business. I guess he never learned better than to take things he shouldn't. \n \n But I'm telling this story now because, while I heard Langford deliver that speech at least a half dozen times, every time he gave it, from somewhere out in the crowd came an \"Amen!\" \n \n But here's the thing. That whole speech was a lie. In Alabama, we do still beat the kids like we used to, at least in places. And while the rest of the country has moved into the 21st century, Alabama has lingered in the past and been left behind. \n \n I've heard variations of Langford's speech all my life, and not just from him. \n \n Not long after I graduated, there was a fight at my high school that some folks in my hometown were even calling a \"race riot.\" \n \n This was 1997. \n \n There were conflicting accounts of what happened, but the most congruent version of events was that a white kid had been wearing a rebel flag bandana and some black kids had been giving him grief about it in the high school parking lot. The white kid apparently called them the n-word. A fight ensued. \n \n As it happened, I was home from college during fall break when the school board called an emergency meeting, so out of curiosity, I went. While the board members met in an executive session, I sat quietly among parents, white and black, who sat somewhat uncomfortably across from each other at cafetorium tables. \n \n I'm not sure what I expected. Maybe some hand-wringing over whether the peaceful and successful integration of the school system was coming unwound. \n \n But nah, instead, they were all talking about how the new principal didn't beat the kids. \n \n Not only that, but a weird one-upmanship followed -- a nostalgia for borderline child abuse. \n \n Our grandmama used to make us cut the switch. \n \n My daddy had a belt this wide and this long. \n \n My momma chased me around the house with a two-by-four. \n \n A consensus crystallized. If the school board brought back paddling, everything would be fine. \n \n But I had gone to that school, just a couple years before, when teachers and administrators did paddle, and I knew what all these parents were mouthing off about was wrong. \n \n When I had been in junior high, our school had a weekend detention called Saturday school. If you've seen the Breakfast Club, you've pretty much got the picture. \n \n Everybody hated Saturday school. Not just the students, but the administrators and teachers, most of all. So when faced with a punishment, most students got a choice -- three licks or three hours. \n \n Everybody took the licks. \n \n While I was still a student there, the school system ended Saturday school and the bargain changed -- three licks or three days suspension. \n \n Everybody still took the licks. \n \n So here's the thing -- if you're offering students a choice of punishment, doesn't it stand to reason that the option they avoid is the greater deterrent? \n \n Ultimately, the school wasn't paddling students because it was an effective deterrent. They were paddling students because it was cheap and easy. \n \n In college, I told classmates that my high school still paddled students and nobody believed me. It hadn't occurred to me before then that the educational environment I'd come up in was no longer considered normal. \n \n Again, that was in 1997. \n \n In the almost two decades since then, some schools in Alabama have moved away from corporal punishment. As Trisha Powell Crain reported for AL.com this week the state paddled nearly 40,000 students in 2000. Since then, that number has dropped by about half. \n \n However, corporal punishment is still legal. And common. \n \n It's not legal to paddle a grown person, mind you, even in an Alabama prison. But in schools, many still take the wood to even small children. \n \n Take a step back -- figuratively from space -- and look at the the map of schools that do and don't strike their students, and one thing is clear -- there is no discernable benefit to striking students instead other forms of punishment, just as those states where corporal punishment is illegal haven't turned into lawless dystopian hellholes. \n \n If corporal punishment did have any positive effect on student performance, Alabama wouldn't sit near the bottom of national academic rankings. It would be number two. \n \n Right behind Mississippi. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Every state has its own approach to the use of corporal punishment in public schools, from outright bans to more localized control. States that allow corporal punishment in public schools usually provide statutory details of what is considered reasonable, including the circumstances in which it's used. But states that don't allow the practice typically make an exception for emergency situations. \n \n See FindLaw's School Discipline section for related articles and resources, including School Discipline History. \n \n What Are Alabama's Laws on Corporal Punishment in Public Schools? \n \n Alabama legislation passed in 1995 allows the use of corporal punishment in public schools, but directs local school boards to adopt their own codes of conduct and disciplinary procedures. The statute doesn't provide much detail, but prohibits any \"excessive force or cruel and unusual punishment.\" \n \n Code Section 16-1-24.1 Punishment Allowed Local school boards to adopt code for conduct and discipline of students. Circumstances Allowable Except in the case of excessive force or cruel and unusual punishment, no certified or noncertified employee of the State Board of Education or any local board of education shall be civilly liable for any action carried out in conformity with state law and system or school rules regarding the control, discipline, suspension, and expulsion of students. \n \n Note: State laws are constantly changing, usually through either new legislation, ballot initiatives, or court rulings. Make sure you contact an Alabama education attorney or conduct your own legal research to verify the state law(s) you are researching. \n \n Examples of Corporal Punishment Policies in Alabama \n \n The majority of public school districts in Alabama use corporal punishment as a regular part of the discipline process, often with the use of a wooden paddle. Most of these policies discourage the use paddling as the first response and allow parents to opt-out. Below are some examples of corporal punishment policies in Alabama: \n \n Alexander City Schools: A maximum of \"three licks administered to a student's buttocks\" is reserved as a last resort before a student is suspended or expelled. A parent may ask that their child not be subject to corporal punishment, but the principal may use it without parental consent under some circumstances. \n \n A maximum of \"three licks administered to a student's buttocks\" is reserved as a last resort before a student is suspended or expelled.

Corporal punishment is of limited effectiveness and has potentially deleterious side effects. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents be encouraged and assisted in the development of methods other than spanking for managing undesired behavior. \n \n Parents often ask pediatricians for advice about the provision of appropriate and effective discipline. In fact, 90% of pediatricians report that they include advice about discipline when providing anticipatory guidance to families.1 The American Academy of Pediatrics held a consensus conference on corporal punishment, the report of which was published in Pediatricsand serves as one major source of information for this statement.2 \n \n The word discipline, which comes from the root word disciplinare\u2014to teach or instruct\u2014refers to the system of teaching and nurturing that prepares children to achieve competence, self-control, self-direction, and caring for others.3 An effective discipline system must contain three vital elements: 1) a learning environment characterized by positive, supportive parent\u2013child relationships; 2) a strategy for systematic teaching and strengthening of desired behaviors (proactive); and 3) a strategy for decreasing or eliminating undesired or ineffective behaviors (reactive). Each of these components needs to be functioning adequately for discipline to result in improved child behavior. \n \n As children grow older and interact with wider, more complex physical and social environments, the adults who care for them must develop increasingly creative strategies to protect them and teach them orderly and desirable patterns of behavior. As a result of consistent structure and teaching (discipline), children integrate the attitudes and expectations of their caregivers into their behavior. Preschoolers begin to develop an understanding of rules, and their behavior is guided by these rules and by the consequences associated with them. As children become school age, these rules become internalized and are accompanied by an increasing sense of responsibility and self-control. Responsibility for behavior is transferred gradually from the caregiving adult to the child, and is especially noticeable during the transition to adolescence. Thus, parents must be prepared to modify their discipline approach over time, using different strategies as the child develops greater independence and capacity for self-regulation and responsibility. The process can be more challenging with children who have developmental disabilities and may require additional or more intense strategies to manage their behavior. \n \n The main parental discipline for infants is to provide generally structured daily routines but also to learn to recognize and respond flexibly to the infant's needs. As infants become more mobile and initiate more contact with the environment, parents must impose limitations and structure to create safe spaces for them to explore and play. Equally important, parents must protect them from potential hazards (eg, by installing safety covers on electric outlets and by removing dangerous objects from their reach) and introduce activities that distract their children from potential hazards. Such proactive behaviors are central to discipline for toddlers. Communicating verbally (a firm no) helps prepare the infant for later use of reasoning, but parents should not expect reasoning, verbal commands, or reprimands to manage the behavior of infants or toddlers. \n \n The earliest discipline strategy is passive and occurs as infants and their caregivers gradually develop a mutually satisfactory schedule of feeding, sleeping, and awakening. Biologic rhythms tend to become more regular and adapt to family routines. Signals of discomfort, such as crying and thrashing, are modified as infants acquire memories of how their distress has been relieved and learn new strategies to focus attention on their emerging needs. 4 \n \n STRATEGIES FOR EFFECTIVE DISCIPLINE \n \n Effective discipline requires three essential components: 1) a positive, supportive, loving relationship between the parent(s) and child, 2) use of positive reinforcement strategies to increase desired behaviors, and 3) removing reinforcement or applying punishment to reduce or eliminate undesired behaviors. All components must be functioning well for discipline to be successful. \n \n Promoting Optimal Parent\u2013Child Relationships and Reinforcing Positive Behaviors For discipline techniques to be most effective, they must occur in the context of a relationship in which children feel loved and secure. In this context, parents' responses to children's behavior, whether approving or disapproving, are likely to have the greatest effect because the parents' approval is important to the children. Parental responses within the context of loving and secure relationships also provide children with a sense that their environment is stable and that a competent adult is taking care of them, which leads to the development of a sense of personal worth. As children respond to the positive nature of the relationship and consistent discipline, the need for frequent negative interactions decreases, and the quality of the relationship improves further for both parents and children. To this end, the best educators of children are people who are good role models and about whom children care enough to want to imitate and please. Certain conditions in the parent\u2013child relationship have been found to be especially important in promoting positive child behavior, including: maintaining a positive emotional tone in the home through play and parental warmth and affection for the child 5 ; \n \n providing attention to the child to increase positive behavior (conversely ignoring, removing, or withholding parent attention to decrease the frequency or intensity of undesirable behaviors). 6 For older children, attention includes being aware of and interested in their school and other activities; \n \n providing consistency in the form of regular times and patterns for daily activities and interactions to reduce resistance, convey respect for the child, and make negative experiences less stressful 7 ; \n \n responding consistently to similar behavioral situations to promote more harmonious parent\u2013 child relationships and more positive child outcomes 8 ; and \n \n being flexible, particularly with older children and adolescents, through listening and negotiation to reduce fewer episodes of child noncompliance with parental expectations.8 Involving the child in decision-making has been associated with long-term enhancement in moral judgment.9 These factors are important in developing a positive, growth-enhancing relationship between parent and child. Even in the best relationships, however, parents will need to provide behavioral limits that their children will not like, and children will behave in ways that are unacceptable to parents. Disagreement and emotional discord occur in all families, but in families with reinforcing positive parent\u2013child relationships and clear expectations and goals for behavior, these episodes are less frequent and less disruptive. \n \n Rewarding Desirable or Effective Behaviors The word discipline usually connotes strategies to reduce or eliminate undesirable behaviors. However, more successful child-rearing systems use procedures to both increase desirable behaviors and decrease undesirable behaviors. Eliminating undesirable behavior without having a strategy to stimulate more desirable behavior generally is not effective. The most critical part of discipline involves helping children learn behaviors that meet parental expectations, are effective in promoting positive social relationships, and help them develop a sense of self-discipline that leads to positive self-esteem. Behaviors that the parents value and want to encourage need to be identified by the parents and understood by their children. Many desirable behavioral patterns emerge as part of the child's normal development, and the role of adults is to notice these behaviors and provide positive attention to strengthen and refine them. Other desirable behaviors are not part of a child's natural repertoire and need to be taught, such as sharing, good manners, empathy, study habits, and behaving according to principles despite the fact that immediate rewards for other behaviors (eg, lying or stealing) may be present. These behaviors must be taught to children through modeling by parents and shaping skills through parental attention and encouragement. It is much easier to stop undesired behaviors than to develop new, effective behaviors. Therefore, parents must identify the positive behaviors and skills that they want for their children and make a concerted effort to teach and strengthen these behaviors. Strategies for parents and other caregivers that help children learn positive behaviors include: providing regular positive attention, sometimes called special time (opportunities to communicate positively are important for children of all ages); \n \n listening carefully to children and helping them learn to use words to express their feelings; \n \n providing children with opportunities to make choices whenever appropriate options exist and then helping them learn to evaluate the potential consequences of their choice; \n \n reinforcing emerging desirable behaviors with frequent praise and ignoring trivial misdeeds; and \n \n modeling orderly, predictable behavior, respectful communication, and collaborative conflict resolution strategies.10 Such strategies have several potential benefits: the desired behavior is more likely to become internalized, the newly learned behavior will be a foundation for other desirable behaviors, and the emotional environment in the family will be more positive, pleasant, and supportive. \n \n Reducing and Eliminating Undesirable Behavior When undesirable behavior occurs, discipline strategies to reduce or eliminate such behavior are needed.11 Undesirable behavior includes behavior that places the child or others in danger, is noncompliant with the reasonable expectations and demands of the parents or other appropriate adults (eg, teachers), and interferes with positive social interactions and self-discipline. Some of these behaviors require an immediate response because of danger or risk to the child. Other undesirable behaviors require a consistent consequence to prevent generalization of the behavior to other situations. Some problems, particularly those that involve intense emotional exchanges, may be handled best by taking a break from the situation and discussing it later when emotions have subsided, developing alternative ways to handle the situation (removing attention), or, in many cases, avoiding these situations altogether. Extinction including time-out and removal of privileges, and punishment are two common discipline approaches that have been associated with reducing undesired behavior. These different strategies, sometimes both confusingly called punishment, are effective if applied appropriately to specific behaviors. Although they both reduce undesired behavior, they work in very different ways and have very different short- and long-term effects. For both strategies, the following factors may increase the effectiveness: clarity on the part of the parent and child about what the problem behavior is and what consequence the child can expect when this behavior occurs; \n \n providing a strong and immediate initial consequence when the targeted behavior first occurs; \n \n consistently providing an appropriate consequence each time a targeted problematic behavior occurs; \n \n delivering instruction and correction calmly and with empathy; and \n \n providing a reason for a consequence for a specific behavior, which helps children beyond toddler age to learn the appropriate behavior12 and improves their overall compliance with requests from adults.13 Occasionally, the consequence for an undesired behavior is immediate, without parental involvement (eg, breaking one's own toy), and may be effective in teaching children to change their behavior. When this consequence is combined with parental reprimand, there is an increase in the likelihood that the child's behavior will be affected for future similar situations. ||||| By Trisha Powell Crain \n \n This story was written for AL.com by independent journalist Trisha Powell Crain of Alabama School Connection. \n \n While most of the nation long ago stopped striking children, Alabama principals continue to boast one of the highest batting percentages in the nation, paddling one child every four minutes. \n \n Across Alabama public schools, nearly 19,000 students were paddled in the 2013-2014 school year, according to newly available data from the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights. The count is of individual students and does not indicate how many were paddled more than once. \n \n Unlike in most of the developed world, Alabama law explicitly allows adults to administer corporal punishment, and education leaders in Alabama find no problem with paddling in schools. \n \n \"I don't anticipate this being the focus of change that Alabama needs to move our student achievement higher,\" said Rep. Terri Collins, R-Decatur, chair of the Education Policy committee in the Alabama House of Representatives. \n \n Collins said no one has brought up the subject of paddling in the legislature. \"As a child paddled, and as a parent who paddled, I've not experienced the negative side of corporal punishment personally, only the positive side,\" Collins said in a statement. \n \n While no studies exist showing improvement of student achievement after corporal punishment is banned, many studies show the negative impact paddling has on children's attitudes toward and achievement in school. After decades of research, all major children's advocacy and medical groups have called for an end to corporal punishment. \n \n But the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the right of public schools to administer corporal punishment to students in 1977. The new federal data shows that most states decline to use the option, as Alabama is one of just 21 states to report any paddling in any public school. \n \n Alabama is one of just 15 states with a state law that explicitly allows for corporal punishment. Another 29 states specifically ban the practice. \n \n In Alabama, the new data also shows disproportionate usage, as boys are far more likely to be paddled than girls, and black and multi-race students are more likely to be paddled than white students. Though black males made up only 24 percent of the population in the schools that paddle, they accounted for 35 percent of the boys who were paddled. \n \n While the number of total swings is far lower for girls, the racial disparity was higher. About a quarter of the girls in schools that paddle are African-American, but nearly half of the girls who were paddled were African-American. \n \n Dr. Amir Whitaker, an attorney at the Southern Poverty Law Center who has studied the effects of paddling, says that Alabama policy contradicts national research. \"It's a very convenient and knee-jerk reaction to discipline. And it does nothing but harm the child. All the research shows that, and all the experts know that,\" Whitaker said. \n \n \"Research clearly says you're more likely to be aggressive if someone is aggressive with you. You're more likely to physically abuse someone if someone has physically abused you,\" he said. \n \n Whitaker points out that if he, as an adult, hit a child with a board, he'd be charged with aggravated assault, yet Alabama law allows adult educators to hit children at school. \n \n \n \n \n \n No debate in Alabama \n \n Meanwhile, 49 nations, including most of Europe and South America, have outlawed the use of corporal punishment both in schools and in the home, according to the Global Initiative to End Corporal Punishment. \n \n And while pressure has mounted on holdouts, such as France, there has been little public debate in Alabama or neighboring states. \n \n \"Proper corporal punishment isn't abuse, and we should be clear about that,\" said Mary Scott Hunter, a member of the state Board of Education. \n \n Hunter said she had not reviewed any research on the subject, nor had she ever been asked about paddling while serving on the state board. But she said she knows many parents and school leaders who use corporal punishment on children, adding she defers to their judgment about its use in a school setting. \n \n \"We often see misbehavior in children that comes straight from the home, and I'd like to see some parents lined up and paddled for that,\" said Hunter. \"Habitual tardiness and truancy comes to mind.\" \n \n Heaviest hitters in the South \n \n Of the 21 states that paddled in 2013-2014, a dozen are in the South. \n \n And when it comes to frequency of paddling, seven of the top ten heaviest hitters are also in the South. Alabama lands at number three in the nation for percentage of students who are paddled, behind Mississippi and Arkansas. \n \n In Alabama, federal data shows 18,749 students were paddled in 2013-2014. That's about 2.5% of all students in Alabama. \n \n But the paddle is not invoked evenly across the state nor across school districts. More than half of all schools in Mississippi paddled students, but just under half in Alabama use corporal punishment. \n \n This first map shows the number of students paddled at least once. \n \n Meanwhile, American education and child advocacy groups, including the American Psychological Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Bar Association, the National Education Association, the American Federation of Teachers, the National Association for Secondary School Principals, and the American Civil Liberties Union, continue to call for a ban, citing harmful long-term effects of paddling on children and the need to keep physical violence out of the educational environment. \n \n The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry policy statement against corporal punishment, reads in part: \"Corporal punishment signals to the child that a way to settle interpersonal conflicts is to use physical force and inflict pain ... Supervising adults who willfully humiliate children and punish by force and pain are often causing more harm than they prevent.\" \n \n The federal definition of corporal punishment is \"paddling, spanking, or other forms of physical punishment imposed on a student\". Alabama leaves its definition to local boards of education. \n \n Here's what Alabama law says about corporal punishment: \n \n \"No student has a right to be unruly in his or her classroom to the extent that such disruption denies fellow students of their right to learn. The teacher in each classroom is expected to maintain order and discipline. Teachers are hereby given the authority and responsibility to use appropriate means of discipline up to and including corporal punishment as may be prescribed by the local board of education.\" \n \n In practice, spanking largely falls to principals and assistant principals, rather than classroom teachers. \n \n Alabama growing cautious \n \n The Alabama Board of Education just hired a new state superintendent from Massachusetts, a state that banned corporal punishment in 1971. State Superintendent Michael Sentance, who starts work today, could not be reached for comment. \n \n Requests for comment from the Alabama State Department of Education were not successful. \n \n But Dr. Eric Mackey, director of the School Superintendents of Alabama (SSA), said he believes the decision to paddle belongs at the district and school level. Mackey has worked in school districts that paddled students and in those that don't. \"I can certainly see both sides of the debate,\" he said. \n \n Maintaining order in the classroom is necessary to ensure students have a good learning environment, Mackey said. He said he believes Alabama school officials have grown cautious about using corporal punishment due in part to the litigious nature of society, but also due to the national trend away from paddling. \n \n For their part, he said, SSA cautions school superintendents to make certain teachers and administrators know what the local board policy allows and to ensure employees follow local board policy. \n \n While the National Education Association has called for a ban on paddling, the Alabama Education Association has not done so. Efforts to reach AEA President Sheila Remington Hocutt to determine why AEA has remained silent on this issue were not successful. \n \n Inside the numbers \n \n In Alabama in 2013-2014, boys were paddled at a 4.5-to-1 rate over girls. \n \n The federal data showed that 107 of Alabama's 133 school districts engaged in the practice. (Two small city school districts, Satsuma and Troy, were not included in the federal data.) \n \n Here's a look at which districts paddled students. Use the drop-down menu to choose whether you want to see the actual number of students paddled or the rate (or percentage) of students paddled. \n \n Even within districts, some schools paddled far more often than others. \n \n Nearly half, or 657 of Alabama's 1,367 schools, saw at least one incident of paddling. More than 400 of those schools that used corporal punishment enrolled elementary-aged children. \n \n Because grade levels vary widely within schools across Alabama, it's hard to say exactly at which grades most of the paddling happened, but 10,550, or 56% of the students who were paddled attended schools that enrolled kindergartners up to at least fifth graders. \n \n Here's a map of all schools that paddled students during the 2013-2014 school year. \n \n When looking at schools where paddling was practiced, black males received the highest rate of paddling, at 13 percent of black males enrolled. Though black males only made up 24 percent of the population, they accounted for 35 percent of the total male students that were paddled. Alabama's numbers mirror national numbers as black males make up 22 percent of the population nationwide and accounted for 38 percent of the total male students paddled nationwide. \n \n Among males of two or more races, one in ten was paddled, double the rate for Hispanic males, and three times the rate for Asian males. Six percent of American Indian males were paddled. \n \n About 8 percent of white males were paddled. Overall, white males made up 66 percent of the total student population in schools where students were paddled, and accounted for 60 percent of the students who were paddled. \n \n Black girls are being paddled at even more disproportionate rates. Though they make up only a quarter of the population at schools where students are paddled, they accounted for 47 percent of all girls who were paddled. White girls, making up 66 percent of the population in schools where students are paddled, also accounted for 47 percent of girls who were paddled. \n \n Students with disabilities were not paddled disproportionately more than students without disabilities statewide. Although within some schools, the numbers show students with disabilities were paddled at higher rates than those without disabilities. \n \n Trending Downward \n \n Though Alabama is still near the top of the list nationally when it comes to use of corporal punishment, the state's numbers have shown a long-term downward trend. \n \n In 2000, nearly 40,000 students were paddled, according to federal data. That number was nearly 30,000 in the 2009-2010 school year, and in the latest data that number is below 20,000. (It should be noted that a representative sample of schools was used prior to the 2011-2012 collection, when every school was required to report discipline data to the U.S. Department of Education.) \n \n Numbers are also trending downward in two Alabama districts that were among the heaviest users of the paddle in 2013-2014. \n \n In Selma City Schools, the Middle CHAT Academy, now known as R.B. Hudson Middle School, landed at the top of the state list for the percentage of students being paddled. Nearly 65%, or 301 of the school's 464 students were paddled. Males took most of the corporal punishment, with 200 of the 234 male students being paddled. Still, out of 230 female students, 101 were paddled. \n \n Throughout the Selma district as a whole, nearly one in four students was paddled. But that appears to have changed. \n \n Dr. Angela Mangum became superintendent of Selma City Schools in April of 2015. When asked about these numbers, Mangum provided 2015-2016 numbers showing only 178 incidents of paddling for the 3,588 students in the district, or one in 20 students, a difference she called \"dramatic\". \n \n \"One of the primary priorities in our district this year is to improve the socio-emotional well-being of students,\" Mangum wrote in an email response. \"We are addressing this priority through improving the climate and culture of our classrooms and schools, and by implementing advisory programs in grade K-12 that emphasizes character development and positive relationships with others.\" \n \n \"We are moving away from the use of corporal punishment,\" echoed Mackey with the Alabama Superintendent association. \n \n The use of alternative strategies, such as positive behavioral intervention supports (known as PBIS), are showing promise, he said. However, funding has \"decreased precipitously\" for teacher training within school districts, and training for programs like PBIS is suffering, he said. \n \n \"As a state, we're not investing in those behavioral interventions and professional development like we were ten years ago,\" Mackey said. \n \n Highest rate in Alabama \n \n While Selma may have claimed the highest rate for a single school, Conecuh County saw the highest rate of paddling by an entire district. \n \n Conecuh County Schools in south Alabama paddled more students at a higher rate than any other district in Alabama. Of the 1,463 students enrolled, 341, or 23.3%, were paddled during the 2013-2014 school year. That was just slightly higher than Selma. \n \n That means all students in Conecuh stood roughly a one in four chance of being paddled. Leading the way in Conecuh, with a 43% rate of paddling, was Thurgood Marshall Middle School in Evergreen, Alabama. \n \n Dr. Zickeyous Byrd, superintendent in Conecuh County Schools, said \"Corporal punishment is allowed in Conecuh County Schools with several restrictions. The very first, and most important one, is that any parent can 'opt out' of corporal punishment for his or her child.\" Byrd said it only takes a simple note from home. \n \n But Byrd also spoke of a move away from corporal punishment. He said since he became superintendent in March 2015, paddling is now used as a \"last resort,\" adding \"only after all other corrective actions have been tried do we administer corporal punishment.\" \n \n Conecuh County's student code of conduct sets out guidelines for how paddling is to be done and specifies \"the employee will use a Board issued paddle\" and the number of \"licks\" will be determined by the principal or his/her designee.\" Also, \"at no time more than three (3) licks will be administered.\" \n \n This map shows the rate of Alabama students paddled at each school by gender. The rate is the percent of students in that school and of that gender that were paddled. https://public.tableau.com/views/CorporalPunishment2013-2014OCRData/RateofStudentsbySchool?:embed=y&:display_count=yes \n \n Why 2013-2014 numbers? \n \n Without the federal civil rights database on school discipline, it is difficult to see what has happened since the 2013-2014 school year. Though many states provide disciplinary actions through their state department of education web sites, Alabama does not. \n \n Discipline data belongs to local school districts, and representatives from the Alabama State Department of Education (ALSDE) have said they do not have access to the data to be able to determine how many students were paddled during a school year. \n \n But paddling students has a long history in Alabama. Much has been said about how southerners tend to spank their children, both at home and at school, more than those living in other areas of the country. \n \n A recent study of all available research, called a \"meta-analysis\", on the effects of corporal punishment shows that paddling is not effective at controlling behaviors. \"Instead of helping children to develop the desire and motivation to behave well of their own accord, corporal punishment teaches children that it is desirable not to get caught: rather than behaving differently next time, they are therefore likely to repeat the undesired behavior and use strategies to avoid being caught.\" \n \n A recent international study linked corporal punishment with lower grades in school. \n \n Whitaker at the Southern Poverty Law Center said that cultural acceptance of spanking children in the South makes it difficult to end the practice at school. \n \n \"As a society, we've acknowledged that bullying in schools should not be tolerated. Arming administrators and teachers with weapons and telling them it's okay to use their physical dominance on children, it's a form of bullying that shouldn't be tolerated,\" he said. \"It sends a message that physical violence is an acceptable way to resolve conflict. In no other area is it acceptable to resolve conflict through violence.

UNICEF's \"Violence Against Children\" report doesn't exactly support paddling enthusiasts, noting that studies have linked corporal punishment to poor mental health, social issues, and academic problems. And many educational and child advocacy groups, including the American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, agree it's ill-advised. But a 1977 Supreme Court decision ruled corporal punishment was not cruel and unusual and that schools could decide whether to use it\u2014and in 1995, Alabama lawmakers gave public schools the right to do so.

Cholesterol-containing deposits (plaque) in your arteries and inflammation are usually to blame for coronary artery disease. \n \n When plaque builds up, they narrow your coronary arteries, decreasing blood flow to your heart. Eventually, the decreased blood flow may cause chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, or other coronary artery disease signs and symptoms.

For individuals with pre-existing heart disease, however, new research finds that the health consequences of repeatedly losing and gaining weight may be even more severe. \n \n \n \n Researchers have found that yo-yo dieting may have serious health implications for people with coronary heart disease. Researchers have found that yo-yo dieting may have serious health implications for people with coronary heart disease. \n \n Researchers found that people with coronary heart disease who had experienced large fluctuations in weight over an average of 4.7 years were at much higher risk of heart attack, stroke, and death than people who experienced little change in body weight. \n \n Lead study author Dr. Sripal Bangalore, of the Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York, and colleagues recently reported their results in the New England Journal of Medicine. \n \n Yo-yo dieting - also known as \"weight cycling\" or the \"yo-yo effect\" - is defined as repeated cycles of weight loss and weight gain. \n \n A number of studies have documented the possible health risks of yo-yo dieting. One study reported by Medical News Today last year, for example, uncovered a link between weight cycling and greater risk of death from heart disease. \n \n The new research from Dr. Bangalore and colleagues builds on those findings, revealing how yo-yo dieting may impact the health of individuals who have pre-existing coronary heart disease. \n \n Coronary heart disease (CHD) - also referred to as coronary artery disease - is the most common form of heart disease among men and women in the United States. Each year, the condition kills more than 370,000 people in the country. \n \n CHD is characterized by atherosclerosis - the buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries, which are those that supply the heart with oxygen-rich blood. This plaque buildup may block the blood supply to the heart, which can lead to angina (severe chest pain) or heart attack. \n \n Largest weight fluctuations linked to 124 percent more deaths \n \n For their study, Dr. Bangalore and colleagues analyzed the data of 9,509 men and women with CHD aged between 35 and 75 years. \n \n As well as CHD, all subjects had high cholesterol levels and a history of other heart problems. Around half of the participants were undergoing intensive cholesterol-lowering therapy. \n \n Over a median follow-up period of 4.7 years, participants were monitored for changes in body weight, and the researchers looked at whether these changes were associated with poorer outcomes. \n \n Subjects with the greatest changes in body weight experienced a weight fluctuation of up to 3.9 kilograms (around 8.6 pounds) during follow-up, while those with the smallest body weight changes had weight fluctuations of 0.9 kilograms (around 2 pounds). \n \n The team found that for individuals who were overweight or obese at study baseline, there were 117 percent more heart attacks, 124 percent more deaths, and 136 percent more strokes among those who experienced the largest changes in body weight, compared with those who experienced the smallest body weight changes. \n \n Additionally, the researchers found a link between changes in body weight and increased risk of new-onset diabetes. \n \n These findings remained after accounting for participants' average body weight and the presence of common risk factors for heart disease, the authors note. \n \n Findings raise concerns about weight fluctuation in people with CHD \n \n Dr. Bangalore and team say that their study is only observational, so it is unable to prove cause-and-effect between yo-yo dieting and increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and death among people with CHD. \n \n Additionally, the authors point to a number of limitations. For example, they were unable to pinpoint precisely why subjects lost or gained weight during follow-up. As such, it is possible that pre-existing heart problems led to weight changes. \n \n Still, the researchers believe that their results warrant further investigation. \n \n \"Our findings suggest that we need to be concerned about weight fluctuation in this group that is already at high risk due to coronary disease. Even though this analysis was not designed to find out the causes of increased risk with body weight fluctuations, we need to examine how we can help Americans keep weight off, rather than having it go up and down.\" Dr. Sripal Bangalore \n \n Learn how yo-yo dieting may be triggered by changes in gut microbes.",

Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

    "document": "WACO, Texas (Sept. 9, 2015) - Most people take breaks during their workdays. Coffee breaks. Lunch breaks. Short chats with coworkers. Maybe late afternoon walks around the building. \n \n But are they taking the best type of breaks? Breaks that boost energy, concentration and motivation? \n \n Two Baylor University researchers have published a new empirical study - \"Give Me a Better Break: Choosing Workday Break Activities to Maximize Resource Recovery\" - in the Journal of Applied Psychology. The research provides a greater understanding of workday breaks and offers suggestions on when, where and how to plan the most beneficial daily escapes from the J-O-B. The research also debunks some common break-time myths. \n \n Emily Hunter, Ph.D., and Cindy Wu, Ph.D., associate professors of management in Baylor University's Hankamer School of Business, surveyed 95 employees (ages 22-67) over a five-day workweek, and each person was asked to document each break they took during that time. Breaks were defined as \"any period of time, formal or informal, during the workday in which work-relevant tasks are not required or expected, including but not limited to a break for lunch, coffee, personal email or socializing with coworkers, not including bathroom breaks.\" \n \n Hunter and Wu chronicled and analyzed a total of 959 break surveys - an average of two breaks per person per day. They say the results of the study benefit both managers and employees. \n \n \"We took some of our layperson hypotheses about what we believed were helpful in a break and tested those empirically in the best way possible,\" Hunter said. \"This is a strong study design with strong analyses to test those hypotheses. What we found was that a better workday break was not composed of many of the things we believed. \" \n \n Key findings of the study include: \n \n 1. The most beneficial time to take a workday break is mid-morning. \n \n Hunter and Wu found that rather than the typical culture of working hard all morning only to take a lunch-hour or mid-afternoon break, a respite earlier in the workday replenishes more resources - energy, concentration and motivation. \n \n \"We found that when more hours had elapsed since the beginning of the work shift, fewer resources and more symptoms of poor health were reported after a break,\" the study says. \"Therefore, breaks later in the day seem to be less effective.\" \n \n 2. \"Better breaks\" incorporate activities that employees prefer. \n \n A common belief exists that doing things that are non-work-related are more beneficial, Hunter explained. Based on the study, there was no evidence to prove that non-work-related activities were more beneficial. \n \n Simply put, preferred break activities are things you choose to do and things you like to do. These could also include work-related tasks. \n \n \"Finding something on your break that you prefer to do - something that's not given to you or assigned to you - are the kinds of activities that are going to make your breaks much more restful, provide better recovery and help you come back to work stronger,\" Hunter said. \n \n 3. People who take \"better breaks\" experience better health and increased job satisfaction. \n \n The employee surveys showed that recovery of resources - energy, concentration and motivation - following a \"better break\" (earlier in the day, doing things they preferred) led workers to experience less somatic symptoms, including headache, eyestrain and lower back pain after the break. \n \n These employees also experienced increased job satisfaction and organizational citizenship behavior as well as a decrease in emotional exhaustion (burnout), the study shows. \n \n 4. Longer breaks are good, but it's beneficial to take frequent short breaks. \n \n While the study was unable to pinpoint an exact length of time for a better workday break (15 minutes, 30 minutes, etc.), the research found that more short breaks were associated with higher resources, suggesting that employees should be encouraged to take more frequent short breaks to facilitate recovery. \n \n \"Unlike your cellphone, which popular wisdom tells us should be depleted to zero percent before you charge it fully to 100 percent, people instead need to charge more frequently throughout the day,\" Hunter said. \n \n ### \n \n ABOUT BAYLOR UNIVERSITY \n \n Baylor University is a private Christian University and a nationally ranked research institution, characterized as having \"high research activity\" by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. The University provides a vibrant campus community for approximately 16,000 students by blending interdisciplinary research with an international reputation for educational excellence and a faculty commitment to teaching and scholarship.

What about keeping one eye on your email while checking the News feed on your cell phone with the other? Or eating a sad-looking salad at your desk for lunch? \n \n If you answered yes to any of those questions, your workday needs a serious upgrade. \n \n Many of us don't take any breaks at work -- roughly 80 percent of U.S. employees don't even take a lunch break -- and when we do, we're often going about them the wrong way. \n \n In a new study, researchers from Baylor University found, our health, productivity and job satisfaction can suffer when we don't make good use of the time we take to step away from work-related activities. \n \n For the study, researchers asked 95 employees to record all the breaks they took over the course of a workweek, which added up to a total of 959 breaks, or an average of two breaks per person each day. \n \n These breaks consisted of any period of time during which employees disengaged from work-related tasks, from an hour-long lunch with coworkers to a few minutes spent checking personal email -- they did not, however, include bathroom breaks. Afterwards, the employees were asked questions about their productivity and well-being. \n \n \"We took some of our layperson hypotheses about what we believed were helpful in a break and tested those empirically in the best way possible,\" Dr. Emily Hunter, one of the study's authors, said in a statement. \"What we found was that a better workday break was not composed of many of the things we believed. \" \n \n Contrary to popular belief, you don't necessarily need to go outside or even leave your desk Hunter said. \n \n Using the responses from the employees the researchers were able to identify which types of breaks tend to leave people feeling the most refreshed -- and it's not necessarily what you might think (or what you're already doing). \n \n Here are the three best ways to maximize your workday break: \n \n Take your first one in the morning. While most employees who were part of the study worked through the morning, pausing for breaks at lunch and maybe once again in the afternoon, the researchers found that the later in the day that people took breaks, the more likely they were to report poor focus, fatigue and headaches. \n \n The best time to take a break is actually mid-morning, before feelings of depletion set in. These early breaks were more effective in replenishing cognitive resources like energy, focus and motivation. \n \n \"You should pace yourself, similar to how plants should be watered early in the day before getting distressed from a long day in the sun,\" Hunter told The Huffington Post in an email. \n \n Keep them relatively short, and take them often. Taking more frequent, shorter breaks seemed to be more effective in boosting productivity and warding off fatigue than taking fewer, longer breaks. \n \n While the researchers weren't able to determine the optimum length of time for a work break, other research has suggested that as little as five minutes can increase energy levels and productivity. \n \n The idea here is that you're preventing yourself from getting too exhausted, instead of taking time to recover after you've already worn yourself out. \n \n \"Popular wisdom dictates that you should let your cell phone battery deplete to 0% before charging it, but you are not your phone,\" Hunter said. \"Instead, our research finds you should charge yourself more frequently, taking a break from work before your energy depletes to 0%.\" \n \n Do something that makes you happy. It doesn't really matter what you do as long as it's something that you truly enjoy doing -- even if it's a work-related passion project. What does that mean? No running errands or paying bills. \n \n \"Preferred activities are more refreshing because they provide a feeling of autonomy and control, they are enjoyable, and they don\u2019t require additional resource expenditure,\" Hunter said.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Did you just get caught taking a few minutes to update your fantasy football team or Instagram your lunch? Just tell your boss it's making you a better worker. Two researchers from Baylor University recently published a study after looking at the break habits of 95 workers to identify a better break. \"What we found was that a better workday break was not composed of many of the things we believed,\" researcher Emily Hunter says in a press release. For example, it turns out, midmorning\u2014not afternoon\u2014is the best time for a break. \"You should pace yourself, similar to how plants should be watered early in the day before getting distressed from a long day in the sun,\" Hunter tells the Huffington Post. Second, don't use the time to run errands. Breaks should be composed of an activity you enjoy\u2014even, counterintuitively, if it's work-related. (Like some kind of \"passion project,\" in the words of HuffPo.) Finally, the researchers found frequent, smaller breaks are ideal over a singular, longer break. \"Unlike your cellphone, which popular wisdom tells us should be depleted to 0% before you charge it fully to 100%, people instead need to charge more frequently throughout the day,\" Hunter says. While they didn't identify an ideal break length, the Huffington Post reports previous studies have shown as little as five minutes away from work can improve productivity. By following their advice for better breaks, researchers say employees will experience less mental and physical burnout. (Others say a lunchtime walk will cure your work woes.)",

    "document": "Only about 2 percent of commercials featuring men showed them doing domestic tasks. \n \n In a phone interview, Arlie Hochschild, the author of The Outsourced Self and the foundational feminist text on women and housework, The Second Shift, makes the argument that a women\u2019s desire for a clean home has deeper origins than just marketing. Cleaning, Hoschild says, is not simply physical work. It\u2019s emotional work. \u201cLetting the house go is in a way letting something deeper go. \u2026 You get a sense of safety in an orderly home,\u201d Hochschild says. \n \n But assuming both parties care about creating a sense of safety in the home, why does it fall to women? I suspect that women are more driven to keep a clean house because they know they\u2014before their male partners\u2014will be judged for having a dirty one. When I lived with two female roommates, I was much more of a slob. None of us was particularly responsible for the emotional tone of that apartment\u2014no single one of us was more likely to be shunned for the state of our bathroom. But when I got married, the dust bunnies hopping across our floor started seeming like a personal affront. Although it was my husband\u2019s father coming over, I was the one who insisted we clean. I was worried I would be judged for the beef jerky wrappers (on both aesthetic and gustatory grounds), despite the fact that my father-in-law has never once made a peep about the state of our abode. Somewhere lodged within me was the message that it was my responsibility. \n \n Unfortunately, the notion that women will be the first to be judged for a messy home and the first to be commended for an orderly one isn\u2019t much of an incentive for men to pick up a mop. In the instances in which men actually do the majority of the housework in their partnership, women are still the ones getting credit. David Michael Perez, the publisher and editor of Kindling Quarterly, says that though he does more decorating and cleaning than his spouse does, \u201coften when people say \u2018your house is nice,\u2019 it\u2019s directed more at my wife.\u201d If they\u2019re not even going to be rewarded for it, why bother at all? \n \n With all these obstacles to real gender parity of chores, what\u2019s a working woman to do? Philosophy professor Alexandra Bradner suggests on the Atlantic\u2019s website that couples sit down with a list of questions like, \u201cDo I do half of the laundry and half of the dishes every day?\u201d to figure out where they\u2019re slacking off in comparison to their mate. This sounds exhausting and impractical. If I do one load of laundry, it\u2019s easier for me to do the second rather than wait for my husband to mosey over. (Bradner also says that when men do traditionally female chores, they\u2019re enacting \u201c\u2018small instances of gender heroism,\u2019 or \u2018SIGH\u2019s\u201d\u2014which, barf.) \n \n I\u2019m much more inclined to take the advice of Jenny Anderson, the co-author of It\u2019s Not You, It\u2019s the Dishes, which applies economic theory to household tasks. A lot of women shoo their husbands away from cleaning because they know the men will do a sub-par job of scrubbing the sink. Anderson says you should divide up tasks according to the economic theory of comparative advantage. Let\u2019s say a woman is twice as good as her husband at doing the laundry, but only 20 percent better than her husband at doing the dishes. In that couple, the husband should always do the dishes. What\u2019s more, he\u2019ll get better at it through repetition. \n \n Another solution is for women to lower their filth thresholds. Did I really need to clean up the house for my father-in-law? Would he have cared if there were a few glasses sitting out on the kitchen table? Probably not. But it\u2019s harder to stomach this fix once you have children, when the threat of a Fisher Price plastic hell-scape is perpetually around the corner. One of the women I interviewed for this piece, who doesn\u2019t want to publicly shame her husband, said that when she came home after a weekday night out, it was so messy that it looked like she had 40 kids instead of two. If she had left the living room like that, it wouldn\u2019t have been very good hygiene modeling for her kids (and, at some point, might get social services called). \n \n One last suggestion comes from Magary, who so emphatically declared that cleaning sucks: make cleaning more fun. He says that when the Swiffer first came on the market, it was sort of enticing. (Swiffer reps said they had no information to share with me about men and cleaning.) \u201cWe like gadgets and stuff,\u201d Magary explains. \u201cIf there was some new electronic hovering Apple product that cleaned the bathroom, I\u2019d try it.\u201d Are you listening out there in Cupertino? You have a huge, untapped market on your hands for toilet-scrubbing iPods. I bet my husband would buy one. ||||| Photo: Roadside Attractions \n \n Jessica Grose has an interesting piece for The New Republic observing \u2014 and also decrying \u2014 that husbands may be catching up with childcare and even cooking, but still do way less housework than women. (\u201cWhen it comes to housecleaning,\u201d she writes, \u201cmy basically modern, egalitarian marriage starts looking more like the backdrop to an Updike short story.\u201d) \n \n Grose casts around for explanations, but does not consider a possibility that probably explains a big part of the gap: Women in general just have higher standards of cleanliness than men do. People who care a lot about neater homes spend more time cleaning them because that makes them happy. And while I agree in general that domestic life requires more gender equality, the housework problem has a partial solution that\u2019s simpler and more elegant: Do less of it. \n \n Viewing housework inequality as entirely a phenomenon of exploitative men free-riding off of female domestic labor makes sense only if you think men derive equal enjoyment from a cleaner and neater home. If that were the case, men who lived by themselves, or with other men, would have to keep their own homes tidy until they could conscript a wife or girlfriend to do their cleaning. \n \n Does anybody think that\u2019s true? In college, I lived in a group house with newspapers for carpeting and pizza boxes stacked to the ceiling. My brother\u2019s three-dude college apartment was so filthy it was condemned by the Ann Arbor board of health. It had a spilled milkshake on the floor that stayed there all year, forming a permanent, unearthly silver blob that became an object of curiosity. (To be clear, this was my brother, not me \u2014 I was content with the pizza box tower, but if it was my floor, I\u2019d have cleaned up the milkshake.) My post-college group house was vastly neater than my college home, yet still messy enough that my girlfriend refused to set foot in it, insisting we spend all our domestic time at her place. \n \n We\u2019re now married, which seems like the proper place to note that the mental image you have probably formed of my domestic habits is not accurate. Mainly because I work at home, and her in the office, I handle more than half the parental responsibilities. I buy all the groceries, cook dinner every night, get the kids ready for school, and walk them in the morning. We split bedtime. If one of them gets sick, my wife still heads to work, and it\u2019s up to me to take care of them. \n \n When the kids were born, we got a housekeeper once a week. Obviously, that\u2019s a luxury many people can\u2019t afford. I mention it because, when Grose bemoans \u201cthe drudgery of vacuuming day in and day out,\u201d I think, Really? Day in and day out? We pretty much figure the weekly vacuuming we pay for takes care of our vacuuming needs. The cover of New York, featuring Lisa Miller\u2019s story on feminist housewives, has an image of a mom holding a duster. We don\u2019t dust. Ever. \n \n The assumption of much of the feminist commentary surrounding household chores assumes that there is a correct level of cleanliness in a heterosexual relationship, and that level is determined by the female. I think a little cultural relativism would improve the debate. The tidiness level of a home is a matter of simple preference with no right or wrong (except perhaps when you reach the antagonizing-municipal-authorities extremes of my brother\u2019s pad.) My wife and I happily learned to converge on each other\u2019s level of tidiness. We settled \u2014 fairly, I think \u2014 on a home that\u2019s neater than I\u2019d prefer to keep it, but less neat than she would. She does a little more housecleaning than I do. But it\u2019s not that much more than the time I spend doing the man-work of trash-clearing, lightbulb-replacing, heavy-object-hauling, and screw-turning. \n \n The tricky thing in allocating the responsibilities between partners is that not all \u201cwork\u201d can be equated. This neat chart from Pew Research has been making the rounds: \n \n Photo: Pew Research \n \n All these things are not the same. Marching the kids through their morning checklist and getting them out the door is stressful work, where every morning feels like I\u2019m trying to pass a bill through the Senate and my kids are Mitch McConnell. Walking them to school is nice. Reading Harry Potter to my daughter, or wrestling on the carpet with my son, is incredibly fun. All those things are \u201cchildcare.\u201d Sometimes on weekdays, I have a sick kid on the sofa while I work in the room next door. Look \u2014 according to that chart, I performed nine hours of child care and nine hours of paid work! (Okay, eight \u2014 we took some story-time breaks.) \n \n Housecleaning is all drudgery and zero fun. But while some of it (like laundry) is necessary, other parts are purely discretionary. I like having magazines strewn across the coffee table. My wife doesn\u2019t. I won\u2019t protest when she stacks them up somewhere, but when she does it, I don\u2019t regard it as her participation in the shared household duties. She handles our household finances, which is a gigantic contribution, out of all proportion to the hours it consumes owing to its stressfulness. \n \n Cooking lies in between, though it depends on the person. I don\u2019t like cooking, especially \u2014 if I could magically conjure the meals instead of prepare them, I would. But it does come with the satisfaction of watching your family enjoy the meal, except that sometimes it comes with the frustration of your spouse coming home late and making it cold, or your kid announcing they won\u2019t try it and marching to the pantry to make a peanut-butter sandwich. \n \n A Pew-style chart of my household would show that I do both more paid work and more childcare than my wife \u2014 mainly because I don\u2019t commute. But that would present an inaccurately slanted picture of our relative contributions. Having more time around the kids while she slogs through the Red Line is a perk I enjoy, not a cost I\u2019m bearing. \n \n For differing reasons, both feminists and anti-feminists have sandblasted away the distinction between different kinds of work, but the distinction matters. I think Grose\u2019s general point, about the unequal demands faced by women, stands. But the specific indictment about housework doesn\u2019t seem quite as solid. \n \n Feminists want women to work like men do, right? Why not try living like men, too? Put down the duster. It\u2019ll be okay.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The world is becoming more egalitarian, with men doing a much larger share of things like cooking and childcare these days. \"It\u2019s seen as socially admirable and masculine for a man to be on diaper duty or to sous-vide a steak,\" writes Jessica Grose, whose own husband handles half the midnight baby feedings. \"But there are no closet organizing tips in the pages of Esquire, no dishwasher detergent ads in the pages of GQ,\" and her husband hasn't scoured a single toilet during their six-year relationship.

    "document": "Caitlyn Jenner, photographed in her Malibu home. \u201cIf I was lying on my deathbed and I had kept this secret and never ever did anything about it, I would be lying there saying, \u2018You just blew your entire life,\u2019 \u201d she says. \n \n On March 15, the day of the Los Angeles Marathon and myriad street closures, Bruce Jenner left his bunker-style home above Decker Canyon in Malibu at 4:15 in the morning to avoid any possibility of being late. Detection seemed unlikely this early in the day; even the paparazzi go back to their wormholes for a few hours\u2019 sleep before the body count begins again. But anything could happen, as it had in January of 2014 in the space of roughly five feet from the back door of a medical office to the car, with Jenner\u2019s neck in a bandage from a tracheal shave, his picture snapped and disseminated into the Internet infinity of insatiable gossip at warp speed. So the more nondescript the car the better, which is why the black 2014 BMW sedan, in the conspicuous consumption of Los Angeles, was inconspicuous. Jenner had already been taking hormones. The hair on his body and his facial hair had been removed. He had had his nose fixed twice and the tracheal shave. On this Sunday his destination was the office of a surgeon specializing in what is known as facial-feminization surgery. Pioneered in the 80s and 90s by San Francisco plastic surgeon Douglas Ousterhout, it can involve such procedures as hairline correction, forehead contouring, and jaw and chin contouring. There would also be a procedure to augment his breasts. Photograph by Annie Leibovitz. The car made its way to the surgical center in Beverly Hills without incident. Jenner was nervous. He knew there would be pain, and he hated taking any kind of drug to alleviate it because of the way it made him feel. But there was more than just physical dread. Several days earlier I had walked with him as he played golf at the exclusive Sherwood Country Club, in Thousand Oaks. He has been a member there for 15 years, ever since Kris Jenner, feeling generous toward her husband, paid the roughly $225,000 initiation fee. He played by himself because he almost always played by himself, a loner who said he wasn\u2019t lonely, although it was hard to see the difference. He didn\u2019t take his game very seriously: he could have been a scratch golfer if he had. He often played two balls at a time, voicing the usual golfer epithets of \u201cSit!\u201d and \u201cGet down!\u201d He liked the peace of it, the Santa Monica Mountains safeguarding the holes like a cupped hand. It was perhaps the only open space he could go to without getting besieged by the paparazzi, not only with their cameras hanging from their necks like evil eyes but also with their questions: \u201cAre you a woman yet?\u201d \u201cDo you still have a penis?\u201d \u201cYou wonder if you are making all the right decisions,\u201d he said as he played in the anonymous uniform of blue sweater and gray slacks and hat and sneakers, parring the 517-yard par-five second hole because he, as usual, drove it at least 280 yards off the tee, being the kind of athlete who can pick up anything instantly. \u201cI wish I were kind of normal. It would be so much more simple. \u201cThe uncomfortableness of being me never leaves all day long,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m not doing this to be interesting. I\u2019m doing this to live.\u201d Given his sense of humor, he couldn\u2019t resist adding, \u201cI\u2019m not doing this so I can hit it off the women\u2019s tee.\u201d After all the confusion and shame and self-conflict and dishonesty for virtually all of his 65 years, was this the right decision? Could he go on living as he had? He was not having genital surgery. There are an estimated 700,000 transgender women and men in the United States; only about a quarter of transgender women have had genital surgery. There is a common misperception that such surgery is somehow \u201crequired\u201d to be a transgender woman or man, akin to a certificate from the Transgender Licensing Board. The transgender community for years has been trying to get the public to understand that genitalia are not a determinant of gender: you can be born a woman with male genitalia, just as you can be born a man with female genitalia. In any case, under the World Professional Association for Transgender Health\u2019s \u201cStandards of Care,\u201d formed by a consensus of leading psychologists and medical specialists, genital surgery is not advised for at least a year after transition. Jenner had actually gone through various stages of transition once before, in the mid- and late 1980s. He took hormones that resulted in breast growth and had his beard removed through an incredibly painful two-year regimen of electrolysis that he withstood without any medication because \u201cpain is kind of, for me, part of the pain for being me \u2026 this is what you get for being who you are. Just take the pain.\u201d The physical changes had been so noticeable that rumors started, including a call from The New York Times about what was going on with Bruce Jenner, in particular Bruce Jenner the winner of the gold medal in the decathlon in the 1976 Olympics, a symbol of masculinity as interwoven into American culture as the Marlboro Man. Jenner had once talked in jest about going to Denmark and coming back to his four young children as Aunt Heather. It was obviously a bizarre thought, indicative of his terrible confusion. It also could be seen as a precursor to the fractured relationship that would occur when he essentially lost contact with the four children from his first two marriages, eventually in favor of yet another new family, with values that had once seemed so alien to his, the Kardashians. \n \n He was living in a one-bedroom house in the Malibu hills in almost total seclusion after he started to transition in the 80s. Dishes piled up. His career was in limbo after an income of half a million dollars the first year after the Olympics. Everything had seemed perfect then, or as close to perfect as it can be when you are pretending your way through life, conforming to the vision of millions because that\u2019s what they expect, and that\u2019s exactly what you give them because you are good at it, scary good. ABC executive Irwin Weiner had offered him a broadcasting job the very same night as his Olympic victory, in Montreal. He tried out for the lead role in the film Superman, which was too much of a stretch without acting experience, although Jenner was actually one of the great actors of our time. He adorned the front of the Wheaties box. He drank orange juice for Tropicana and took pictures for Minolta. He gave speeches about the 48 hours of his Olympic win all over the country to enthralled audiences. He was red, white, and blue. He was Mom and apple pie with a daub of vanilla ice cream for extra deliciousness in a country desperate for such an image. He had a tireless work ethic. He had beaten the Commie bastards. He was America. \u201cJenner is twirling the nation like a baton; he and his wife, Chrystie, are so high up on the pedestal of American heroism, it would take a crane to get them down,\u201d wrote Tony Kornheiser in The New York Times in 1977. He also secretly wore panty hose and a bra underneath his suit so he could at least feel some sensation of his true gender identity. He stopped transitioning in the late 80s. He was scared of what the reaction would be. He decided he could not do this to his four children, Burt, Cassandra, Brandon, and Brody. He needed to jump-start his career. He needed credibility to squelch the rumors, and he told me marrying Kris Kardashian, in 1991, helped give him that along with compatibility and love. Photograph by Annie Leibovitz; Styled by Jessica Diehl. In March, he had been living on his own for about a year and a half since his and Kris\u2019s separation, which would ultimately lead to their divorce after 23 years of marriage. It gave him the opportunity to live more freely as a woman. It wasn\u2019t enough. He worried the most about how the two daughters whom he and Kris share, Kendall and Kylie, would react to his transition. But Kendall was a 19-year- old supermodel, and Kylie, at 17, already had endorsement deals for various beauty products, in addition to what they make from Keeping Up with the Kardashians, on the E! network. They were each independent enough to have bought homes, Kendall a condo for $1.4 million in the area of Westwood, Kylie a house in Calabasas for $2.7 million. Now that he felt the two girls could process the change, there was only one step left. Bruce Jenner went to the office in Beverly Hills, thinking the facial-feminization surgery would take about five hours. Caitlyn Jenner left the office in Beverly Hills after the procedure had taken roughly 10 hours. Comfort in Isolation \n \n During the first full day of recuperation, there was a moment when Caitlyn Jenner lay down on her bed as best she could, hoping to get some sleep. The pain was such that she had no choice but to be on large amounts of medication. She had ice packs over her eyes. She closed them for a little bit, then suddenly shot up, causing the ice packs to slip. She was undergoing something that had never happened before in 65 years of life: a panic attack. She told the 24-hour nurse on duty she had to get out of bed. Caitlyn asked her to turn on the television so the sound would be a distraction. The recently purchased $3.6 million home\u2014built with concrete slabs like the artillery batteries you can still see on the Pacific coast, put there in case of a Japanese attack during World War II\u2014was one floor on top of an aboveground garage. There were three bedrooms off the long hallway and then the kitchen and dining area and sunken living room in an open floor plan. It offered remarkable views of Catalina Island and the Pacific and glimpses of whales through the floor-to-ceiling windows in her bedroom. Because of its literal mountaintop location, you could see everything but not hear anything except the flapping-flag sound of the wind. No nearby neighbors. No cars pulling up. It was encapsulated in silence, and maybe that was the point of living there, comfort in isolation. Caitlyn went into the long hallway and paced back and forth on the dark wood floor, where not even the footsteps made a sound. The panic attack lasted about 15 seconds, but a single thought continued to course through her mind: \u201cWhat did I just do? What did I just do to myself?\u201d A counselor from the Los Angeles Gender Center came over to the house so Caitlyn could talk to someone with professional expertise. The counselor helped ease her mind. She said such reactions were often induced by the pain medication. She also said such second-guessing was human and temporary. The thought has since passed and has not come back. There is no buyer\u2019s remorse. Not that it matters anyway, because there is no turning back. \u201cIf I was lying on my deathbed and I had kept this secret and never ever did anything about it, I would be lying there saying, \u2018You just blew your entire life,\u2019 \u201d she told me. \u201c \u2018You never dealt with yourself,\u2019 and I don\u2019t want that to happen.\u201d Bruce Jenner, she said, was \u201calways telling lies.\u201d Caitlyn Jenner, she said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t have any lies.\u201d Bruce Jenner caused hurt to four children who loved and idolized him before he gave his love and total attention to another family. Caitlyn Jenner has the possibility to make it right and close the fissure as much as she can. \u201cI have high hopes that Caitlyn is a better person than Bruce,\u201d said his oldest son, Burt, now 36. \u201cI\u2019m very much looking forward to that.\u201d \u201cIt Ain\u2019t Bruce\u201d \n \n This is the most remarkable story I have ever worked on in 38 years as a journalist, the only writer in the world with unlimited access to Jenner for a story of global interest, witness to the final months of one of the most iconic male athletes before he disappears and a woman appears in his place. I spent hundreds of hours with the man over a period of three months. Then I spent countless hours with the woman. It was initially weird, and virtually anyone who says it isn\u2019t weird is giving themselves far too much credit. It was initially surreal, having seen Bruce Jenner set seven personal bests as he won the decathlon in 1976 with that perfectly buff body, and seeing him now in an elegant black dress with fine-looking breasts. With apologies to members of the transgender community, who are rightfully sensitive about the use of language, I constantly used \u201che\u201d instead of \u201cshe,\u201d and at one point called Caitlyn \u201cdude\u201d out of force of habit, and closed conversations with \u201cAll right, man, I\u2019ll talk to you soon.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t really get hung up,\u201d she told me. \u201cA guy came in the other day and I was fully dressed\u2014it\u2019s just habit, I said \u2018Hi, Bruce here,\u2019 and I went, Oh fuck, it ain\u2019t Bruce, I was screwing up doing it.\u201d My miscues have nothing to do with intolerance\u2014I have been a cross-dresser with a big-time fetish for women\u2019s leather and an open critic of the often arbitrary delineation between men\u2019s and women\u2019s clothing\u2014but because it is a strange story regardless of all the important inroads that have been made by transgender men and women into the cultural mainstream. Just as it is a tragic one, and a painful one, and a harmful one, for so many years, not just to himself but to others he should have been closest to, and a lonely one, and a brave one, and a funny one, and maybe, just maybe, because it is far too early to tell, a triumphant one. The Show Must Go On \n \n Or maybe, given Jenner\u2019s past, it\u2019s all just fodder for a \u201cdocu-series\u201d (i.e., reality television in a fancy suit) that, in May, Caitlyn started shooting for the E! network, debuting this summer. Can you hear the thunder of a Kardashian spin-off? The same four children whom he lost contact with for years at a time, none of whom have the last name Kardashian, fear exactly that. They also fear that the spectacular way in which she came across on the ABC 20/20 special two-hour interview with Diane Sawyer (Caitlyn had completed her transition by the time the show aired, on April 24) will endanger what she can do for the continued momentum of the transgender movement. Instead they worry that the whole narrative will devolve into spectacle and shenanigans intercut with a little dash of social cause and the use of paid consultants who are experts on transgender issues as a cover for social responsibility. She is also someone who in the past has been easily influenced by the opinions of others. Caitlyn insists that will not be the case since, as an executive producer, she has full creative control. Her insistence is real. The children, collectively known as \u201cthe Jenner side\u201d and all in their 30s and as grounded as the Kardashians are not, feel otherwise. Through the portal of their television show, the relationship of the Kardashian children to their dad has unfolded publicly for eight years. The relationship of the Jenner children with their dad has gone untold: unless you were a Keeping Up with the Kardashians fetishist, you might not even know that he had four other children. Given the pressure placed on them to participate in the upcoming E! series, it became clear to me that their story is more germane than ever. They disagree with their father\u2019s decision to use not only the same production company that made Keeping Up with the Kardashians but many of the same people, including several original executive producers. The E! network, with such shows as Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Total Divas, The Royals, and Botched, is not known for its subtlety. In the hope of repairing their relationship with their father, they\u2014Brandon in particular\u2014have supported Caitlyn, and that support has been inspiring to her. The last thing the Jenner kids want to do is reverse the rebuilding of the relationship. But despite numerous entreaties from their father as well as the head of E! programming, the Jenner children refuse to participate, forgoing financial gain and exposure in the process. At first their decision did not seem to register with Caitlyn. She kept hoping they could be persuaded because she knows from eight years on Keeping Up with the Kardashians the necessity of a family dynamic for ratings success. When she realized the decision was final, she became increasingly frustrated and on one occasion hurled profanities. She told me she felt \u201cterribly disappointed and terribly hurt.\u201d Caitlyn neither understands the tragic irony of those words nor recognizes her historical tendency toward self-victimization. Based on hours of interviews with the Jenner children, as well as his two ex-wives, a picture emerges of a father who had been absent for years at a time, insensitive, hurtful, and weak in no longer making an effort to keep up contact after he married Kris Kardashian. Caitlyn openly acknowledged to me mistakes made with them as Bruce Jenner. The regret is genuine. Juggling two ex-wives with a third wife was at times very difficult. But not seeing his children for long periods, beginning around the time of their adolescence, not acknowledging birthdays, not going to graduations, and intentionally not being there for the birth of his daughter were Jenner\u2019s own decisions. The wounding only went deeper, given that Bruce Jenner was an exemplary father to the so-called Kardashian side, including Kendall and Kylie. In the course of their father\u2019s journey, the Jenner children have gone through their own journey as well. \u201cLove has nothing to do with gender,\u201d said his daughter Cassandra. She paused for a moment and added this: \u201cThere\u2019s no way to separate what he\u2019s going through, the trap he\u2019s been in for the past 60 years and how that has affected his choices around love and relationships. It\u2019s impossible.\u201d Light and Shadow \n \n About two weeks after the surgery, I sat on a stool at the kitchen counter opposite Caitlyn. She had listened to Monica Lewinsky\u2019s powerful TED talk on what it is like to be the ceaseless target of cyber-ridicule. The talk had struck a chord with Caitlyn because of the similarities with how she had been dealt with on the Internet. She had in front of her five pages of notes. It dawned on me that she was going to give her version of a TED talk to an audience of one: me. It went on for nearly 40 minutes. My heart bled for Caitlyn. She was so earnest, trying so hard: you could feel the essential goodness in Caitlyn, and Bruce Jenner before her. Mistakes had been made, ones that caused terrible scars, but as many others had said about him, they emanated from following a path of least resistance as well as from a hatred of confrontation. Bruce was instantly likable, a singsong lilt in a voice of amusement and bemusement, shades of sweet goofiness. It was how he liked to interact, bouncing along the surface. But it seemed like he often used the method of communication as a guard against emotional connection. \u201cIf he had emotional legs he\u2019d get up and walk to you,\u201d Jenner\u2019s second wife, Linda Thompson, remembers telling her son Brandon after his father had not attended his high-school graduation. \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t. He just doesn\u2019t have that capability.\u201d It was late afternoon by the time the simulated TED talk ended. Light streamed in through the kitchen bay windows, slanting through the bottle of handwash onto the porcelain sink and the Wolf stove and the Sub-Zero refrigerator. The clarity was piercing, only adding to the stillness, relics of an archaeological expedition, a remodeled kitchen untouched by human hands discovered in the hills of Malibu. The light then suddenly shifted. It angled on her face in a perfect dissection of brightness and shadow down the centerline. Caitlyn looked gorgeous in the light. Her features were accentuated and popped. Just as her features were obscured in the shadow. I did not know which way it would go. Only where it had already gone. \u201cNature Made a Mistake\u201d \n \n When Jenner\u2019s sister Pam was a young girl she noticed some\u00adthing puzzling one day on the bookshelf of the family\u2019s house, in Cornwall, New York. It was the mid-1950s, and like millions of other American families in the 50s the Jenners had a set of encyclopedias. What was odd to Pam was the way in which her brother Bruce, 16 months younger, had arranged them: from A to Z, right to left. She noticed how her younger brother spelled \u201csaw\u201d as \u201cwas\u201d and \u201cwas\u201d as \u201csaw.\u201d Pam concluded, as would just about any older sibling caught up in her own world, that Bruce was just \u201ca stupid younger brother.\u201d Their mother, Esther, was puzzled. When she worked on spelling with her son she noticed that he spelled every word right one day and then completely forgot the next. \u201cBruce, you\u2019re not concentrating. You\u2019re daydreaming,\u201d she said to him. In second grade, since he still could not read, he was held back. Teachers thought that the child, whose father, William, was a tree surgeon, was just lazy. It was only later that Jenner was diagnosed with dyslexia, a learning disability marked by difficulty in processing language. He wasn\u2019t lazy or stupid. He could spell every word right the first time because he had memorized them. His self-esteem as a child was understandably poor. Dealing with his dyslexia was enough of a challenge for Bruce Jenner. It was enough for any young boy trying to navigate the rock-rimmed shore of peer acceptance. Jenner is fond of invoking God in setting out the challenges of his life. If that is the case, then God had a daily double in store. When Bruce was around 10, he would sneak into his mother\u2019s closet, sometimes his sister\u2019s. He would put on a dress and maybe wrap a scarf around his head and walk around outside. Without knowing the clinical term for what he was feeling\u2014gender dysphoria\u2014he found himself \u201cfascinated by it all,\u201d just as he felt \u201cscared to death somebody was going to find out.\u201d Because there was nobody he could talk to about it. He didn\u2019t tell anyone until the early 1970s, when he told his first wife, Chrystie. In the context of the late 1950s the very concept of a transgender woman in the United States was foreign, the only publicized experience that of Christine Jorgensen, a former World War II G.I. from the Bronx whose name at the time was George Jorgensen Jr. She underwent gender-reassignment surgery in Denmark because it wasn\u2019t done in the United States. The story became public on December 1, 1952, after the New York Daily News got ahold of a letter Jorgensen had written to her parents in which she said, \u201cNature made a mistake, which I have had corrected, and I am now your daughter.\u201d The resulting publicity was astonishing but the interest largely prurient and centered on someone with a penis going to a foreign country and coming back with a vagina. In fifth grade Jenner ran in a race, perhaps the most important sporting event in which he ever participated. He turned out to be the fastest kid in school. His athletic ability led him to football and basketball at Sleepy Hollow High School, and then Newtown High School, in Sandy Hook, Connecticut, after he moved there in the middle of 11th grade. It also exhibited itself out of school when he won the Eastern States water-skiing championship. \u201cSports saved my life,\u201d Jenner said. He became popular because jocks are always popular. He became determined in sports because he was gifted, but also because it helped to prove his masculinity, since, as he told me, \u201cthat\u2019s what everybody wants to believe.\u201d He went to tiny Graceland College, in Lamoni, Iowa, on a football scholarship. He hurt his knee, ending his football career. But a coach there, L. D. Weldon, who happened to be an expert in the decathlon, saw something in Jenner, and Jenner responded to it. He came out of nowhere in April of 1971 to win the decathlon at the Kansas Relays. He made the United States Olympic team in 1972 and finished 10th in the decathlon in Munich. After the end of the competition, 10 different events in two days, Jenner went on a long-distance run through the streets of Munich. It was the beginning of a training regimen in which he would practice eight hours a day, every day, for the next four years, leading up to the 1976 Olympics. Going for Gold \n \n The decathlon was perfect for him, not just as a sporting event and the ultimate in he-man-ism but also as a years-long diversion from the awareness that he identified as a woman. He hoped for much of his life that the gender dysphoria would somehow go away, be stamped out with enough diversions, or at least not occupy his thoughts: decathlon training, other sports after the Olympics such as professional car racing and tennis, becoming a pilot, marrying and having a family. \u201cYou always think in the back of your mind, I can live with this. I can fix this\u2026. If I just do this it\u2019s going to be O.K.,\u201d he told me. On July 30, 1976, in Montreal, Jenner won the decathlon, the most grueling event of the Olympics, at the age of 26, with a world rec\u00adord 8,618 points. Because of the times, a country struggling with the aftershock of Vietnam and the oil embargo and Watergate, he became a supercharged hero. The United States\u2019 performance at the 1976 Olympics\u2014where it won only one individual gold medal in men\u2019s track and none in women\u2019s track and was embarrassed by the Soviet Union and East Germany at the peak of the Cold War\u2014only heightened the need. Tens of millions watched Jenner on television, buff and with that mane of hair flowing like a lion\u2019s, running through the Olympic stadium holding a small American flag which had been handed to him by an overjoyed spectator. He was six two and 194 pounds of mostly muscle, perfectly proportioned. \u201cBruce Jenner of San Jose, Calif., wants to be a movie or television star. After his record-breaking victory in the Olympic decathlon today, he probably can be anything he wants,\u201d wrote Frank Litsky in The New York Times. Although Litsky did not know it at the time\u2014no one did, except for Jenner\u2019s first wife, and she did not know the full extent\u2014falser words could never be written. Becoming a woman wasn\u2019t going to happen, because he had won not simply a gold medal but a gold medal in the decathlon, which carries with it the title of \u201cthe world\u2019s greatest athlete.\u201d Litsky went on to list the usual descriptive suspects\u2014\u201ca handsome, cheerful, outgoing man with long, straight blond hair.\u201d \u201cPeople say, Oh my God, what a body\u2014you look great. That wasn\u2019t what I was looking for,\u201d Jenner told me. \u201cI could not really cross-dress. I tried to grow my hair out as much as I could without getting yelled at.\u201d The night of his Olympic win Jenner and his wife, Chrystie, stayed in a penthouse hotel suite in Montreal. It was arranged by his lawyer at the time, Alan Rothenberg, after he realized that the Jenners, typically, with their innocence and lack of lavishness, had made no plan for a place to stay. After Jenner woke up the next morning, he walked past the grand piano into the bathroom. He was naked. The gold medal was around his neck. He looked at himself in the mirror. The grand diversion of winning the decathlon was finished. Everything would change. Nothing had changed. He didn\u2019t see a hunk. He didn\u2019t see success. Instead of reveling in the accomplishment, he diminished it in his mind because he had done it, the stupid little boy with dyslexia. The little boy who knew he had been born a girl and was now just trying to put one over on the rest of the world. \u201cNow what do I do?\u201d he said to himself. He was too irresistible for the starved nation, too perfect. He almost immediately signed a contract with ABC. He got taken in the seventh round of the National Basketball Association draft in 1977 by the Kansas City Kings. He did the endorsements and the speeches. He knew he was bullshitting. \u201cUnderneath my suit I have a bra and panty hose and this and that and thinking to myself, They know nothing about me. \u201cI walk off the stage and I\u2019d feel like a liar. And I would say, \u2018Fuck, I can\u2019t tell my story. There\u2019s so much more to me than those 48 hours in the stadium, and I can\u2019t talk about it.\u2019 It was frustrating. You get mad at yourself\u2026. Little did they know I was totally empty inside. Totally empty inside.\u201d Chrystie \n \n Jenner had married Chrystie Crownover in 1972. They had met in college. She was the daughter of a minister from southeastern Washington State. She suggested the marriage, in part because her job as a flight attendant for United Airlines gave her access to free tickets for herself and her spouse, so they could fly to decathlon events all over the world. In stark contrast to the Kardashian period, they drove under the redwoods of California with Beethoven blasting and grabbed a rope swing to drop into the Russian River. Chrystie was the breadwinner, a devoted partner in his journey to a gold medal. In 1973, early in the marriage, Chrystie noticed a rubber band attached to the hook of one of her bras. She asked Bruce about it. She remembered him telling her, \u201cGee, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Subsequently he gathered the nerve and brought up the mystery of the bra again. \u201cThat\u2019s why the rubber band. Because I\u2019ve been wearing your clothes.\u201d Photograph by Annie Leibovitz; Styled by Jessica Diehl. \u201cHe told me he always wanted to be a woman,\u201d Chrystie said. \u201cHe told me as a little kid how that felt. He told me [of] different fantasies that he had, related to loving women.\u201d Chrystie felt immense gratitude that he was sharing something so intimate with her. \u201cIf he had been wanting to dress up when he was with me or any of those things it would have been different. But he was still masculine. He was still my hero. He was still pursuing this goal of being the greatest athlete in the world. It wasn\u2019t like it was a hard thing to handle. It was like a piece of information he shared with me and then he went back to being a real guy\u2026. He had a strong, healthy sex drive and seemed like pure man.\u201d Bruce Jenner as Bruce Jenner had a sexual appetite exclusively for women. Caitlyn has no idea what the future will hold as Caitlyn Jenner. But, she adds, it is not important to her right now. \u201cIf you have a list of 10 reasons to transition, sex would be number 10.\u201d It should also be emphasized that sexual preference and gender identity have nothing to do with each other. In September 1978, Chrystie and Bruce had Burton, or Burt for short. He was named after Jenner\u2019s younger brother, who had died in a car accident shortly after the Olympics, on the day he was supposed to fly to California to live with Bruce and establish residency in hopes of attending a state university. The marriage began to fissure. They separated for a period of time, then got back together. Chrystie became pregnant; in an interview in Playboy in 1980, Jenner said, \u201cMy first reaction was that I didn\u2019t want it,\u201d and he asked her to consider an abortion. They separated permanently when Chrystie was still pregnant with their second child, Cassandra, who is now 34. She has two young children with her husband, Michael Marino, who is in private equity. \u201cI never knew he wasn\u2019t at my birth until I was about 13 years old and we were arguing on the phone about money,\u201d Cassandra, a 2001 graduate of Boston College and stay-at-home mother, told me. \u201cHe kept saying, \u2018You don\u2019t know the whole story.\u2019 \u201cI hung up the phone and was asking my mom what he was talking about until she confessed the history behind my birth.\u201d Jenner told me he was in the middle of divorcing Chrystie when he found out she was pregnant. He said he brought up the idea of an abortion but rejected it after 30 seconds. He was in a hotel room in Kansas City when Cassandra was born. He cried, but \u201cunder the circumstances I could not even see myself being there.\u201d Linda \n \n Jenner started seeing Linda Thomp\u00adson, a performer on the syndicated country-music and variety show Hee Haw who would go on to have an accomplished career as a songwriter. (She and her second husband, David Foster, co-wrote the song \u201cI Have Nothing,\u201d made famous by Whitney Houston.) Bruce and Linda had met at the Playboy Mansion during a tennis tournament. Jenner divorced Chrystie in 1980 and married Thompson several months later, in January of the following year. She was pregnant at the time with their first son, Brandon. He appeared on the cover of Playgirl with Linda Thompson in May of 1982. He was shirtless (but not hairless). Linda, in what looks to be a low-cut leotard, has her lips and nose pressed sensually against his cheek. In a question-and-answer interview he talks about his \u201cmasculine qualities\u201d and their healthy sex life and the fabulousness of their marriage after a year. It appears obvious in hindsight that he was desperately trying to maintain his cover in a society that still largely condemned transgender women and men. They had been married for more than four years and had two children, Brandon and Brody, when he told Linda of his gender dysphoria. She said she was shocked and devastated. Brandon was about three and a half at the time and Brody 18 months. They went into counseling, but, Thompson told me, the therapist said the condition would never go away. \u201c \u2018You can live with him as he transitions and you can have what you might consider a lesbian relationship because, you know, you can stay married to him. You will both be women, but he\u2019s attracted to you. He would like to stay married to you. Or if that doesn\u2019t appeal to you, you can move on.\u2019 \u201cAnd I opted for the latter because I married a man\u2026. As much as I felt my life and my dream were destroyed and I was going to have to get a divorce, and then my kids, I was going one day to have to explain to them\u2014I thought my pain doesn\u2019t compare to the pain that he\u2019s in. At least I\u2019m comfortable living in my own body.\u201d Jenner describes the period of the mid- to late 80s as \u201cthe dark years.\u201d He had no social life. Professional opportunities dwindled, in part because he had no motivation to work and didn\u2019t seem to care. He had moved from ABC to NBC, and around 1983 his contract was not renewed. He was tired of giving speeches. His acting career had resulted in one feature film, back in 1980: Allan Carr\u2019s frantic Can\u2019t Stop the Music, a thoroughly bizarre film with Steve Guttenberg and Valerie Perrine and the Village People trying to capitalize on the disco era. Its campiness is so bad that it\u2019s sociologically fascinating to watch today. But it received the 1980 Razzie for worst picture and screenplay; Jenner was nominated for worst actor but lost out to Neil Diamond, for The Jazz Singer. A made-for-television film, Grambling\u2019s White Tiger\u2014starring Jenner as a white quarterback on the otherwise all-black Grambling State University football team, with Harry Belafonte as legendary coach Eddie Robinson\u2014was well received. But it did not propel him anywhere. He was running out of the diversions that had guided his life. But the gender issues were not going away; if anything, they were intensifying. \u201cThe gender issues were big at that time,\u201d Jenner told me. \u201cI had ignored them for so long, but I was aging.\u201d \u201cI Don\u2019t Want to Be This Way\u201d \n \n It was during that first attempt at transition, in the mid-and late 1980s, that he went on hormones, had his beard removed, and had plastic surgery on his nose. The changes were noticeable. Brody Jenner, now 31 years old and a reality-TV staple with a new show called Sex with Brody, debuting on E! this summer, was somewhere around 4 when he said to his mother, \u201cMommy, we saw Daddy get out of the shower and he\u2019s got boobs.\u201d Rumors began in the media and were squelched. \u201cI was terrified of being discovered,\u201d Jenner said. \u201cI was not at a point in my life where I was comfortable with myself. \u201c \u2018I don\u2019t want to be this way\u2019 was the bottom line. Who would want to be dealing with all these issues\u2026. I look at men and say, Oh my God, would it not be so wonderful to be comfortable in your own skin, male or female, so when you wake up in the morning you get dressed and go to work and this identity issue is not even pres\u00adent? \u201cYou\u2019re happy being who you are. You have a beautiful wife and this and that\u2026. I look at women and think the exact same thing: Wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful to wake up in the morning and be able to get dressed and go out and live your life?\u201d But the context of the times made Jenner scared. There were only a handful of well-publicized transgender cases. The at\u00admo\u00adsphere for transgender men and women was still extremely difficult. Johns Hopkins Hospital had come to public attention for championing sexual-reassignment surgeries in 1966 but stopped doing the procedure 13 years later, after a controversial study by a psychiatrist there reported that recipients, in making psychosexual adjustment, were no better off than those who didn\u2019t have the surgery. Paul McHugh, psychiatrist in chief for the medical school, whose stance against gender-reassignment surgery borders on religious zealotry in the eyes of activists, was instrumental in the decision, concluding that the only surgery as radical and misguided was the lobotomy. The same year, 1979, Professor Janice G. Raymond published The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male. She wrote in the book, \u201cI contend that the problem of transsexualism would best be served by morally mandating it out of existence.\u201d Enormous strides are being made today in the acceptance of transgender women and men, thanks, in part, to the Golden Globe Award-winning Amazon series Transparent and such transgender spokeswomen as the writer Janet Mock and Orange Is the New Black star Laverne Cox. (Last year Cox appeared on the cover of Time magazine with the headline THE TRANSGENDER TIPPING POINT.) Yet only 19 states have laws to protect transgender workers. Kris \n \n Around 1990, Jenner stopped his transition. He decided he needed to \u201cget back in the game.\u201d He was in Ketchikan, Alaska, finishing a celebrity fishing show with former Los Angeles Dodgers first-baseman Steve Garvey, when Garvey\u2019s wife, Candace, raised the idea of fixing him up with Kris Kardashian. She was divorced from Robert Kardashian, who went on to fame\u2014or perhaps infamy\u2014as a friend and attorney of O. J. Simpson\u2019s and died of cancer in 2003, at the age of 59. Candace mentioned that Kris lived in Beverly Hills with a marvelous sense of style and great shopping skill. Jenner at first was not interested. \u201cI\u2019m thinking the last thing I need is a Beverly Hills shopper,\u201d Jenner said. \u201cI don\u2019t need that. No offense to shoppers. It\u2019s the perception of this woman who sits around Beverly Hills and goes shopping all day.\u201d On second thought, Candace said, it would never work since Kris, like Jenner, had four children. Then Jenner was interested: \u201cShe comes with as much baggage as I do.\u201d They hit it off immediately and seven months later, in 1991, were married. The issue of how much Bruce Jenner told Kris of his gender-identity issues is a matter of dispute: neither side wants to appear rancorous, but the two sides agree on virtually nothing. Breast growth as the result of hormones is irreversible. Jenner insists that he was a \u201cgood solid B cup\u201d when he met Kris. She said it was comparable to a \u201clittle bit of a man boob situation\u201d but that there was \u201cno B cup going on.\u201d The issue goes to the core of how much moral obligation Jenner, or anyone with established gender dysphoria, has to tell a prospective spouse of his or her condition. \u201cWhen I met Bruce,\u201d Kris said, \u201che told me that he had done hormones back in the early 80s. This was a conversation that took place in the early 90s. So, what he was telling me happened a dec\u00adade earlier, and he never really explained it.\u201d As far as Kris Jenner was concerned, \u201cthere wasn\u2019t a gender issue. Nobody mentioned a gender issue. Somebody mentioned that [he] at one point in his life liked to dress up.\u201d Jenner is emphatic that he told Kris he had taken hormones in the late 1980s up until the year they met, and was equally emphatic in saying there were other side effects besides breast growth. He finds it implausible for her to suggest she was not aware of his gender struggle. But he does concede that \u201cprobably a mistake I made was maybe not having her understand\u2014not the severity of it but that this is a condition you cannot get away from. From that standpoint maybe I blew it away a little bit, sort of \u2018This is what I do.\u2019 \u201d He said he did cross-dress in front of her. But ultimately, he said, she set down rules: he could cross-dress when he was traveling on his own but not at home. Kris said he never cross-dressed in front of her, the only evidence \u201ca few times I would see a suitcase or things lying around the house.\u201d She also said she never set down any rules. At first, based on interviews, the merging of Jenner\u2019s children from the first two marriages with the four children from Kris\u2019s first marriage\u2014Kourtney, Kimberly, Khlo\u00e9, and Robert junior\u2014was a happy one. The eight of them performed together at the Jenners\u2019 wedding as \u201cthe \u201cJennashians.\u201d The Jenner children continued to live with their mothers, but they said that they frequently went over to their father\u2019s house and that Kris embraced them. Then it all stopped. The children maintain that Kris essentially turned on them. Kris said she and her husband stopped seeing the children \u201cbecause you just got to a point where it became exhausting to be embattled all the time. We weren\u2019t getting anywhere with constantly asking to see the kids and not getting a yes. And I think the kids really didn\u2019t hear that side of it.\u201d Relations became further strained when Linda Thompson, after waiving child support at the time of divorce, took her ex-husband to court to get it. Jenner told me that the suit had a very negative impact on Kris\u2019s willingness to integrate the families. Jenner acknowledged that his focus was on Ken\u00addall and Kylie and his four stepchildren and that he thought, \u201cI can hopefully build a relationship with the Jenner side once they\u2019re old enough and mature enough and they\u2019re out from under the apron of their mothers.\u201d Burt Jenner, who owns West LA Dogs, a day-care center for dogs, said he does not remember seeing his father more than twice a year for a period of roughly 10 years. Brandon Jenner, who is 33 and in an accomplished indie-pop duo with his wife, Leah, still maintained a sporadic relationship with his father. But even he went through stretches of two to three years without ever hearing from him. The other two children also went through long periods of never seeing their father at all. Jenner said he was not invited to such milestone events as high-school graduations and would have gone had he known; the children and their mothers say he was invited and in some instances did not even respond. When the Northridge earthquake hit the Los Angeles region, in 1994, Brandon, then 12, told his mother that his father had called to see if the family was O.K. His mother was delighted that Bruce had called. \u201cMom, I\u2019m just kidding,\u201d Brandon told her. \u201cI think the nail in the coffin for the relationship was the beginning of the TV show,\u201d in 2007, said Burt. \u201cThere was a you-aren\u2019t-part-of- this kind of thing. Kris made the choice to make a good TV show that was in their image and brand.\u201d As she put it in a book she wrote called Kris Jenner \u2026 and All Things Kardashian, the title \u201cKeeping Up with the Kardashians and the Jenners just didn\u2019t have the same ring to it.\u201d Family Matters \n \n Burt wonders now if it would have been better for him if his dad had not been an Olympic champion. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to have a father to idolize,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt would have been much easier if he hadn\u2019t won the Olympics.\u201d Burt is a formidable racecar driver, as his father was, winning the Octane Academy competition on NBC in 2013, which netted him $50,000 in prize money and a car. \u201cMy father taught me on the athletic field,\u201d Burt said. \u201cThe confidence in yourself to go out and win.\u201d But Burt, notable in the family for being bluntly candid, also said, \u201cI was very fortunate to have an awesome stepfather to fill the void\u2026. At the end of the day there\u2019s no way I can get around it. I am ungodly thankful and I feel very fortunate to not have had my father in my life\u2026. I learned how to open doors and shake hands and look people in the eye. Things that my dad never would have taught me.\u201d Photograph by Annie Leibovitz; Styled by Jessica Diehl. Jenner does have regrets. \u201cI have made a lot of mistakes raising the four Jenner kids. I had times not only dealing with my own issues but exes. [It was] very traumatic and there was a lot of turmoil in my life, and I wasn\u2019t as close to my kids as I should have been.\u201d It was actually during one of the most difficult periods of his life, the attempted transition in the late 1980s, that they found a caring and loving father. As Cassandra put it, he was a better parent when he \u201cwas moving towards his authentic self.\u201d As she said of her dad, \u201cI would happily have traded a distant father for a loving, involved mom.\u201d Keeping Up with Bruce and Kris \n \n Kris Jenner took over her husband\u2019s foundering career after they were married. She got rid of Jenner\u2019s handlers. She renewed his speaking engagements. He appeared in infomercials for Eagle Eyes Sunglasses and for a piece of workout equipment called the SuperStep and other products. They did an infomercial series called \u201cSuper Fit with Bruce and Kris Jenner.\u201d The efforts were financially successful. But after Keeping Up with the Kardashians started and became a runaway hit, the dynamics of the relationship changed, Jenner told me. \u201cThe first 15 years I felt she needed me more because I was the breadwinner\u2026. Then really around the show, when that hit and she was running this whole show and getting credit for it and she had her own money, she didn\u2019t need me as much from that standpoint. The relationship was different. \u201cI think in a lot of ways she became less tolerant of me. Then I\u2019d get upset and the whole relationship kind of fizzled.\u201d One has to watch only a sampling of the show to see the interaction. \u201cA lot of times she wasn\u2019t very nice,\u201d Jenner said. \u201cPeople would see how I got mistreated. She controlled the money \u2026 all that kind of stuff.\u201d Kris Jenner acknowledged that her workload quadrupled as the result of the ever-expanding Keeping Up with the Kardashians empire and she \u201cdidn\u2019t have the kind of time she had in the past.\u201d She also said Bruce was often angry and upset during the last years of the marriage. \u201cHe was married to me and he wasn\u2019t who he wanted to be so he was miserable\u2026. All I was doing was working very hard for my family so that we could all have a wonderful future, and he was pissed off. \u201cAt the end of my relationship with Bruce he definitely had a lot of social anxiety,\u201d Kris said. \u201cThat was one of the reasons we were in a struggle at the end. We fought a lot because we would go out together and before we got to the end of the block we were in a fight because he started saying, \u2018When can we go home?\u2019 \u201d What strikes her now is how her husband, after fully embracing life for much of their marriage, \u201cjust decided I\u2019m done now\u201d without explaining his gender dysphoria until after they were divorced. \u201cIt was like the most passive-aggressive thing I think I\u2019ve ever experienced.\u201d As she asked rhetorically of her former husband, \u201cWhy would you want to be married and have kids if this is what you wanted since you were a little boy? Why would you not explain this all to me?\u201d Jenner said that from his perspective the disintegration of the marriage had far less to do with gender issues and far more to do with the way Kris dealt with him: \u201cTwenty percent was gender and 80 percent was the way I was treated.\u201d They separated in June 2013. He rented a house in Malibu. They were amicably divorced last September. The agreement was completed with no lawyers, an indication, Jenner said, \u201cof 23 great years together.\u201d He said that he retained the contracts that were his and she retained the ones considered hers. The agreement, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, states that they aimed to divide their assets evenly, but Kris almost certainly emerged much wealthier than Bruce, since she kept sole possession of all the business interests and intellectual property in her name\u2014including Keeping Up with the Kardashians and its spin- offs. Jenner knew that at some point he would have to tell his children of his gender identity. But any right to privacy he should have had was irrevocably lost in December of 2013 when he got a call from TMZ asking him if he had just had a medical consultation for the tracheal shave. Jenner remembers pulling his car to the side of the road. He pleaded that nothing be published because it would \u201cdestroy lives.\u201d The pleas were unsuccessful. The item appeared online. Pacing the hallway of his rented home in Malibu that night after publication, he contemplated suicide with a gun he kept in the house. He decided not to go through with it. But he also realized that, with the story now out there, he was going to have to tell his children. He also knew he would now need a strategy for eventually going public with his transition. The TMZ disclosure had robbed him of any right to his own timeline. He told each of his children individually, starting with Brandon, whose reaction was unequivocal: \u201cI\u2019ve never been more proud of you than I am at this moment.\u201d The rest of the Jenner children reacted much the same way. They were already aware of their father\u2019s identity as a woman. Their mother had told Burt and Cassandra roughly 20 years earlier, when they were 13 and 11. Brandon had assumed it because of the obvious physical changes. Brody was not told by his mother until he was 29. \u201cAs soon as I heard it, it was almost a relief. Because it just made a lot of sense growing up,\u201d Brody told me. \u201cReasons and things like why he wasn\u2019t there. Not around. I finally realized he had his own issues he was dealing with at that time.\u201d About a year ago, Brandon and Brody got a sobering glimpse of their father\u2019s life when they went over to the Malibu rental house to surf. As they put on their wetsuits early in the morning, they saw that lights were on inside. Brandon went over to say hello, then quickly came back and told his brother they needed to leave immediately because he had just seen their father at the computer in a gown and earrings. Because they knew their father identified as a woman, they were not shocked. But they also knew he did not want them to see him dressed like this. \u201cHe wakes up at 4:30 in the morning probably because he\u2019s not tired but [also] because that\u2019s the [only] part of the day he actually gets to be\u201d what he wants, said Brody. \u201cThat\u2019s so sad, when you can\u2019t be like that always.\u201d The Jenner children feel both happiness for their father and inspiration at his bravery. They also feel that their relationship with their dad will now have an opportunity to grow. \u201cI feel like he\u2019s been the closest to us and the best parent when he\u2019s been moving toward his true identity,\u201d said Cassandra. As part of the transition, Jenner started hosting intermittent and small gatherings called \u201cgirls\u2019 nights,\u201d casual occasions with wine and food in which Jenner could dress as desired and feel natural and comfortable in the presence of women. It was at a girls\u2019 night that Cassandra met Caitlyn for the first time. \u201cI was just nervous that I wouldn\u2019t make her feel comfortable,\u201d Cassandra said. \u201cI was worried I wouldn\u2019t say the right things or act the right way or seem relaxed.\u201d But almost all of it melted away when she got there. \u201cWe talked more than we ever have. We could just be girls together.\u201d It\u2019s Her World Now \n \n For the Jenner children the issue of the transition has become a non-issue. They all still see their dad as their dad regardless of any gender label. Brandon said he was a little taken aback when he saw Caitlyn for the first time after surgery and she pulled her top up to reveal her new breasts. \u201cWhoa, I\u2019m still your son,\u201d he gently reminded her. But the moment easily passed. After so many years of non-contact and hurt, one of the most stirring parts of the transition has been the renewal of the relationship of the Jenner children with their father. Except that disagreement over the upcoming E! docu-series has posed yet another hurdle. The children believe that with the right producers the show could be wonderful on multiple levels, including elevating public consciousness of the issues surrounding the transgender community, much the way the Sawyer interview did. The docu-series will be produced by Bunim/Murray, the company responsible for such shows as The Real World, The Simple Life, Bad Girls Club, and, of course, Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Bunim/Murray is credited with inventing reality television: nobody does it better. But this is not your typical reality show. Their father\u2019s adamant decision to use some of the same producers and much of the same crew who have produced the Kardashian episodes for 10 seasons only enhanced their concern that the show would devolve into maximum mayhem and minimum social awareness. The children said they were interested not in their own financial gain but in ensuring the legacy of their father as perhaps the most socially influential athlete since Muhammad Ali. At a meeting at the Jenner house with another prospective producer, who was not chosen, Brandon laid out his concerns succinctly: \u201cYou go on E!\u2019s Web site, the Bunim/Murray Web site, and you look at all the shows, every one of them is a circus.\u201d \u201cWith Bunim/Murray and E! it\u2019s been the opposite of inspiration,\u201d he said during the meeting. \u201cOh my God, we\u2019re diving into the lion\u2019s den\u2014they\u2019re gonna make a show about the Jenners versus the Kardashians.\u201d Brandon Jenner wants his father to know this is simply the kind of disagreement that happens in families. He wants his dad to know he loves and admires her, as do all the Jenner children, just as he hopes that his father\u2019s love will not become conditional, as it has been in the past. \u201cThis is the fourth quarter of [her] life. But within our relationship this is the first quarter, the relationship that [she] has with the kids. Regardless of the show and all that stuff, there will be a fourth quarter of the relationship. And I envision the fourth quarter as having a 15- or 16-year-old daughter who knows her grandparent as \u2018Mapa\u2019 or whatever Dad wants to be, and loves that grandparent for who she is.\u201d E!\u2019s head of programming, Jeff Olde, hopes the children will decide to participate once they see the quality and tone of the show. He respects their decision and knows it is \u201ccoming from a place of pure love.\u201d He also said this will be a quality show with a totally different feel from other E! offerings. \u201cIt\u2019s not at all a Kardashian spin-off\u2026. We will not resort to spectacle. That doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t have fun with it.\u201d \u201cWe all love ratings,\u201d Olde said, \u201cbut we understand the power and responsibility to be able to share this story.\u201d Olde, who is gay and married, said he and his husband have been in the trenches for almost 20 years fighting for equal rights. \u201cThis is so far beyond television, on a personal level. If I get one thing right in my professional career, it will be this.\u201d Jeff Jenkins, the executive vice president of development and programming for Bunim/Murray, echoed Olde\u2019s sentiment and said that \u201cratings are not the goal\u201d of the series. \u201cIt is to tell Bruce\u2019s story the way he wants it to be told.\u201d Bunim/Murray has produced several well-received shows on members of the L.G.B.T. community, including Pedro Zamora, whose groundbreaking participation in 1994\u2019s The Real World: San Francisco made him one of the first openly gay H.I.V.-positive people to be depicted on prime-time television. There are many out there who think the E! series, while slightly more elegant perhaps, is just a stunt to make money. Caitlyn Jenner is prepared for the criticism just as she is also prepared with an answer. \u201c \u2018Oh, she\u2019s doing a stupid reality show. She\u2019s doing it for the money. She\u2019s doing this, she\u2019s doing that.\u2019 I\u2019m not doing it for money. I\u2019m doing it to help my soul and help other people. If I can make a dollar, I certainly am not stupid. [I have] house payments and all that kind of stuff. I will never make an excuse for something like that. Yeah, this is a business. \u201cYou don\u2019t go out and change your gender for a television show. O.K., it ain\u2019t happening. I don\u2019t care who you are. It ain\u2019t happening, O.K.? You don\u2019t do it.\u201d Caitlyn\u2019s 89-year-old mother, Esther, while enormously proud of her son\u2019s courage, is among those who have wondered about motive. \u201cI woke up one night and all I was thinking about is: Why is it necessary [for Caitlyn] to go through all these surgeries?\u201d Esther said. \u201cIs this all about making money? And that was bothering me. He\u2019s lived a life the last 25 years\u2014and I don\u2019t know if it was both he and Kris or mainly Kris\u2014it seemed like their lifestyle was about money; that\u2019s why it came to my mind.\u201d The lifestyle was the materialistic equivalent of morbid obesity, but Jenner never was a part of it. I can say unequivocally that he actually hates to spend money. The recently purchased house did cost $3.6 million, but that is low by celebrity standards, and it has a mortgage on it. The big-ticket items, a 2011 Porsche 911 GT3 RS that cost somewhere around $180,000 and the country-club membership, were birthday gifts from Kris. I watched with fascination as he fetched golf balls out of the water hazard on the sixth hole at Sherwood with a pole so he would never have to buy any himself, honorably returning the ones stamped with \u201c99\u201d to fellow club member Wayne Gretzky. The Legend Becomes Her \n \n It was early May, and Caitlyn had just gotten three letters from transgender women thanking her for the interview and the dignified way in which ABC and Sawyer had handled it. One of them was addressed \u201cBruce Jenner, Malibu, California,\u201d as if she had become her own country. An incredible 16.9 million had watched on a Friday night. \u201cHonestly, since the Diane Sawyer piece every day it\u2019s exciting to go to the mailbox, because I get letters every day from all of these people from all over the world,\u201d she told me. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten a lot from trans women, telling their story, and how excited they were to see the Diane piece.\u201d She first watched the Sawyer interview on ABC\u2019s East Coast feed with the Kardashian klan, sitting between Kendall and Kylie. The two youngest children worried that the reaction would be negative, only to be put at ease by the Twitter messages rolling in from famous people\u2014Lady Gaga and Miley Cyrus and Oprah Winfrey and Jimmy Fallon and a dozen others. Caitlyn then watched a second time at nine P.M. with the four Jenner children and their mothers. Brandon called the experience \u201cone of the best nights of my life.\u201d \u201cWas it tough to watch? Of course it was,\u201d Caitlyn told me. \u201cI never thought in a million years I would ever have to divulge such private, intimate feelings I\u2019ve had all my life\u2026. I was also excited to get it off my chest. Scared but excited.\u201d The reaction from the celebrity community was overwhelmingly positive, perhaps because Caitlyn Jenner is a fellow club member. The estimated 700,000 transgender women and men in the country are virtually all anonymous, too many of them suffering from job discrimination and violence. A 2013 report co-authored by a variety of equality and human-rights groups, including the Human Rights Campaign, said that transgender workers have a 14 percent rate of unemployment, double that of the general population; 44 percent are under-employed; and 15 percent have a household income under $10,000, as opposed to 4 percent in the general population. The National Transgender Discrimination Survey Report in 2010, based on roughly 6,500 responses to an extensive questionnaire, determined that the attempted-suicide rate for transgender women and men was a staggering 41 percent, compared to 1.6 percent in the general population. I can report that Caitlyn seems immensely happy, relaxed, with a shiny sense of purpose and confidence. She can\u2019t wait when she goes out now to tell the paparazzi to \u201cmake sure it\u2019s a good shot,\u201d instead of asking patrons to help shield her from them in the parking lot of the local Starbucks. She looks forward to re-creating the at\u00admo\u00adsphere of \u201cgirls\u2019 night\u201d on a more regular basis, \u201cwhere everybody is treating you the same way. You can talk about anything you want to talk about. You can talk about outfits. You can talk about hair and makeup, anything you want. It becomes not a big deal.\u201d She is aware of the appalling conditions in which many transgender women and men live, and said that in her E! show she will focus on ways of lowering the rates of suicide and attempted suicide, among other issues. Caitlyn also plans a segment in which she sees if she can still hit a golf ball 300 yards off the tee, even with those very ample breasts. There is a road trip planned, in which Caitlyn and several transgender women will take an R.V. from the Los Angeles area to San Francisco to visit a center for transgender youth, and then on to Napa Valley. She said she now accepts the children\u2019s decision regarding the E! series. \u201cI think it\u2019s better for the show right now. It keeps me on point and doesn\u2019t distract with all the family issues.\u201d As a possible peace offering, Caitlyn went over to Brandon and Leah\u2019s house recently, not to make one last charge to persuade but to help plant a garden. \u201cI think the relationship will take a new shape,\u201d said Brandon. \u201cMy hopes that the relationship would blossom, that we would turn over a new leaf, has kind of turned into, I just want a relationship that is sustainable. I just want to have the best parts as possible.\u201d On July 15, Caitlyn\u2019s first major public appearance, she will be awarded the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at ESPN\u2019s ESPYs in Los Angeles. Its past winners include Muhammad Ali, Nelson Mandela, and Billie Jean King. All 10 of her children and stepchildren are expected to be onstage when she accepts it.

In the weeks following this disaster, the Project Loon team has been working with the Government of Puerto Rico, the FCC, the FAA, FEMA, spectrum partners and international aviation authorities to bring balloon powered internet to the island to help. Thanks to their support, we are now collaborating with AT&T to deliver emergency internet service to the hardest hit parts of the island. \n \n Working with AT&T, Project Loon is now supporting basic communication and internet activities like sending text messages and accessing information online for some people with LTE enabled phones. This is the first time we have used our new machine learning powered algorithms to keep balloons clustered over Puerto Rico, so we\u2019re still learning how best to do this.

    "document": "[+] Enlarge Frederick Breedon/Getty Images Brek Shea and the U.S. took a one-goal lead into stoppage time. But El Salvador equalized to end the match at 3-3, eliminating the Americans from Olympic qualifying. \n \n Despite being a heavy favorite to emerge from the CONCACAF qualifying tournament with a ticket to the 2012 Olympics in London this summer in hand, the U.S. Under-23 national team was eliminated in a 3-3 tie to El Salvador Monday night. \n \n Needing a win to advance from Group A after suffering a 2-0 upset to Canada on Saturday, the U.S. went ahead before a minute was up, surrendered its lead, went behind, equalized, went ahead again and allowed the game-tying goal in the very last minute of extra time. \n \n A first-minute goal got the U.S. off to a flying start. Brek Shea broke through on the left and sent a cross into Terrence Boyd, who volleyed the ball into the net from close range. \n \n But the Americans had trouble establishing their usual possession-dominating rhythm in the first half, discovering quickly that they were facing the strongest opponent in the tournament thus far. El Salvador competed for the ball and clogged the spaces well. This forced the U.S. to lump long balls to Shea and Boyd. And although Boyd did his best to be a handful in the box -- winning the ball in the 11th and putting himself through on goal before giving up possession -- this tactic was largely ineffective. \n \n Crucially, keeper Bill Hamid tweaked his left ankle in the 31st minute. Within six minutes, El Salvador would twice punish his refusal to come off, or coach Caleb Porter's failure to substitute him. Undoubtedly, this will be picked apart in the coming weeks. In the 35th minute, Hamid failed to impose himself, or even move, on a corner to his near post. Lester Blanco rose over Kofi Sarkodi and headed in to equalize. In the 37th, Perry Kitchen and Jorge Villafana stood and watched as a low, straightforward cross into the box rolled toward the post, where Andres Flores beat the stumbling Hamid to the ball and slipped it underneath him and into the net. Shell-shocked and panicked, the U.S. barreled forward for the remainder of the half but produced little of consequence. \n \n In the second half, El Salvador set about running down the clock, nibbling away the minutes with a series of time-wasting tactics. Mostly, El Salvador frustrated the U.S. by inviting the Americans into its own half before crashing the spaces and clearing the ball to send its opponent back to square one. Throughout the game, the U.S.'s midfield trio failed to secure enough of the ball to settle into a rhythm and provide service to the forwards. All the U.S. could muster, then, for 20 minutes, was a dangerous shot by Freddy Adu. \n \n In the 64th minute, a flagging El Salvadoran defense slipped up. Boyd brought down a long punt from Sean Johnson (who had replaced the injured Hamid), whereupon Adu slipped Boyd a ball through the back line. Boyd finished cleanly, making it 2-2. Four minutes later, Joe Corona, anonymous throughout the game, found himself on the end of a rare dangerous cross from Adu at the second post and was allowed to head in the liberating goal. With the deficit overturned, the U.S. was seemingly on its way to the decisive semifinal game. \n \n It had now fallen to the U.S. to ride out the game. But it fell into the same trap as El Salvador had. The Americans allowed themselves to be put under pressure and cede the initiative to their irked opponents, who grew increasingly aggressive. The Yanks appeared to be getting away with it, too. But in the fourth and final minute of extra time, Amobi Okugo lost track of playmaker Jaime Alas, who ran through the center of the U.S.'s defense and hit a bouncing shot that skipped awkwardly. Johnson punched the ball skyward, only to see it skip into the U.S. goal. \n \n The U.S. had been unable to stamp its authority on a second consecutive game, allowing El Salvador entry points into the game time and again by failing to maintain possession. Brimming with talent, this U.S. team's failure to qualify for the Summer Games will be remembered as both a stain on a federation that failed to send a U-20 team to the 2011 World Cup and a blight on the resume of coaching prodigy Porter. \n \n But given its performances, it's hard to argue that the U.S. deserved much better. Here are our player grades (10=best) \n \n GK -- Bill Hamid, 3: Was convincing in the early going but should have indicated that he was in no condition to proceed after taking a knock in the 30th minute. El Salvador's first two goals could have been avoided by prompter interventions from Hamid (or the coach) before he came off in the 39th minute. \n \n D -- Kofi Sarkodie, 4.5: Simply beaten in the air on the 1-1, Sarkodie was once again better going forward than he was defensively. \n \n D -- Ike Opara, 4: Looked sharper than he had against Canada, but he failed to step out on Alas on the dooming 3-3. \n \n D -- Perry Kitchen, 4: Kitchen was steady enough throughout the game, but he should have been more alert as the eventual 2-1 rolled past him. \n \n D -- Jorge Villafana, 4.5: Impressive early on, Villafana just let Flores run by him undisturbed to make it 2-1. \n \n M -- Amobi Okugo, 5.5: A seventh-minute yellow card took the sting out of his game but he nevertheless had a strong night plugging holes and shielding the defense. And then he let Alas run away from him to score the 3-3. \n \n M -- Mix Diskerud, 5: Not a banner night for him, but not his worst either. He tried his best to distribute but was sometimes sloppy and didn't find enough of the ball to go around. \n \n M -- Joe Corona, 4.5: Scored the goal that should have sent the U.S. through but was otherwise invisible. Like he had against Canada, Corona appeared completely lost. \n \n F -- Freddy Adu, 7: Played out on the right again, a position where he never looked comfortable, Adu was most effective on set pieces and when he drifted inside. His two assists were incisive, however, and should have made the difference. \n \n F -- Terrence Boyd, 7: Active and mobile, Boyd replaced Agudelo capably by providing a good target and getting teammates involved. He converted two of four big chances and should have been the hero of the night. \n \n F -- Brek Shea, 6: Did good work disturbing the back line and picked up an assist. But his crossing often let him down. \n \n Subs: \n \n GK -- Sean Johnson, 4.5: Confidently stepped in for Hamid in the 39th minute and made a handful of crucial saves. But that bouncing shot that sent the U.S. crashing out may haunt him for years, as he probably should have dealt with it. \n \n M -- Michael Stephens, Incomplete: An 88th minute substitute for Corona, Stephens had little impact. \n \n F -- Joe Gyau, Incomplete: A 93rd minute time-wasting substitution. \n \n Leander Schaerlaeckens is a soccer writer for ESPN.com.

(Associated Press) \n \n The United States, known for producing top goalkeepers such as Brad Friedel, Kasey Keller and Tim Howard, found itself done in Monday night when substitute Sean Johnson couldn't handle a long shot from Jaime Alas of El Salvador in stoppage time. \n \n The ball bounced off his hands, up over him and into the net, and El Salvador ousted the United States from Olympic qualifying with a 3-3 tie. \n \n The stunned Americans missed the Olympics for the second time since 1976 and second time in three games. \n \n \"This is probably the worst feeling I've ever felt in my life so far as a pro athlete,\" U.S. captain Freddy Adu said. \"This is going to be hard to get over. But at the end of the day things like this happen. For me, I never want to feel this way again, and I'm going to do whatever it takes to never feel this way again.\" \n \n The Americans had to win to reach Saturday's semifinals in Kansas City, Kan., and they led 3-2 on Joe Corona's goal in the 68th minute. Officials added 4 minutes of stoppage time onto the game, and U.S. coach Caleb Porter said they were \"seconds away\" from closing out the win and taking the top spot in Group A. A television clock showed the ball going in 4 minutes, 14 seconds into stoppage time. \n \n What happened is something U.S. midfielder Mix Diskerud said no one wants to experience in life, something he couldn't believe. \n \n \"The last 20 minutes after our third goal, all those minutes felt like very, very long hours. But I thought we were going to make it. Everybody thought we were going to make it.,\" Diskerud said. \n \n \"One shot.\" \n \n Several Americans dropped to the field in exhaustion and disbelief after Alas' score, and Porter had to rally them back to their feet for one last gasp chance that didn't materialize. Porter said he hugged Johnson after the game. The 6-foot-4 keeper did not speak with reporters. \n \n \"He feels like he's let everybody down, let his teammates down, and I told him he didn't,\" Porter said. \n \n El Salvador reached the semifinals, putting it a win away from its first Olympic berth since 1968. Canada, which tied Cuba 1-1 earlier, finished second. Lester Blanco and Andres Flores also scored for El Salvador, a team coach Mauricio Alfaro pointed out had less than two weeks to prepare for this tournament and didn't have the whole roster together until late. \n \n \"It was just incredible,\" Alfaro said of the win, speaking through an interpreter. \n \n But Alfaro also said he had told his players to shoot more in the second half to try to pressure Johnson and the El Salvador coach said he did feel Johnson made a mistake on Alas' kick. \n \n \"The shot didn't have much power,\" Alfaro said. \n \n Terrence Boyd scored twice for the U.S., and Johnson replaced keeper Bill Hamid in the 39th minute. \n \n After a 2-0 loss to Canada in the second of this three-game, round-robin tournament, the Americans needed to win to advance. \n \n So did El Salvador, and the crowd of 7,889 was about evenly split between the countries keeping the U.S. from a true home-field advantage at LP Field, home of the NFL's Tennessee Titans. El Salvador survived a physical game with plenty of yellow cards on each side. \n \n Boyd went to the sideline with blood on the front of his shirt late in the game.

Design Secondary analysis of a prospective, multi-institution, longitudinal study of patients with advanced cancer. Setting Eight outpatient oncology clinics in the United States. Participants 386 adult patients with metastatic cancers refractory to at least one chemotherapy regimen, whom physicians identified as terminally ill at study enrollment and who subsequently died. Main outcome measures Primary outcomes: intensive medical care (cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, or both) in the last week of life and patients\u2019 place of death (for example, intensive care unit). Secondary outcomes: survival, late hospice referrals (\u22641 week before death), and dying in preferred place of death. Results 216 (56%) of 386 terminally ill cancer patients were receiving palliative chemotherapy at study enrollment, a median of 4.0 months before death. After propensity score weighted adjustment, use of chemotherapy at enrollment was associated with higher rates of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, or both in the last week of life (14% v 2%; adjusted risk difference 10.5%, 95% confidence interval 5.0% to 15.5%) and late hospice referrals (54% v 37%; 13.6%, 3.6% to 23.6%) but no difference in survival (hazard ratio 1.11, 95% confidence interval 0.90 to 1.38). Patients receiving palliative chemotherapy were more likely to die in an intensive care unit (11% v 2%; adjusted risk difference 6.1%, 1.1% to 11.1%) and less likely to die at home (47% v 66%; \u221210.8%, \u22121.0% to \u221220.6%), compared with those who were not. Patients receiving palliative chemotherapy were also less likely to die in their preferred place, compared with those who were not (65% v 80%; adjusted risk difference \u22129.4%, \u22120.8% to \u221218.1%). Conclusions The use of chemotherapy in terminally ill cancer patients in the last months of life was associated with an increased risk of undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilation or both and of dying in an intensive care unit. Future research should determine the mechanisms by which palliative chemotherapy affects end of life outcomes and patients\u2019 attainment of their goals. \n \n Introduction Chemotherapy is used to treat metastatic cancer, with the goal of palliating symptoms and improving survival. Between 20% and 50% of patients with incurable cancers receive chemotherapy within 30 days of death,1 2 despite growing concerns that it may not be effective. Recently, the American Society for Clinical Oncology identified end of life chemotherapy as one of the \u201ctop five\u201d practices that could improve patients\u2019 care and reduce costs, if stopped.3 Deciding when to discontinue chemotherapy is often challenging, however, given limited data on whether chemotherapy is helpful or harmful in the final months of life.2 4 5 Research suggests that the use of chemotherapy within two weeks of death is associated with lower rates of hospice use,6 7 but only 6.2% of patients receive chemotherapy this late.8 Most decisions about treatment occur months before death, when data to guide decision making about chemotherapy are more limited. For example, in a randomized controlled study comparing early palliative care integrated with oncology care versus standard oncology care among patients newly diagnosed as having metastatic lung cancer, Greer et al found that 62% of all enrolled patients received chemotherapy within two months of death.9 10 However, patients who received concurrent palliative and oncologic care stopped intravenous chemotherapy an average of two months earlier than did those in the standard oncology group but had a longer median overall survival and were more likely to receive at least one week of hospice services.9 10 To our knowledge, however, Greer at al\u2019s study and others have not specifically examined whether the use of chemotherapy in the months leading up to the patient\u2019s death is associated with the subsequent receipt of intensive medical care in the last week of life or death in an intensive care unit. In this secondary analysis of Coping with Cancer data,11 we sought to determine whether terminally ill cancer patients who were receiving chemotherapy at study enrollment were more likely to receive intensive medical care in the last week of life and die in an intensive care unit, compared with those who were not. We hypothesized that palliative chemotherapy would be associated with more intensive medical care (for example, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, or both) and late referrals to a hospice, as chemotherapy is often an exclusion criterion for hospice admission,12 13 and oncologists express reluctance about discussing advance care planning while prescribing chemotherapy.14 15 16 Similarly, we expected that patients receiving palliative chemotherapy would be less likely to die where they wanted to, as oncologists often delay discussing patients\u2019 preferred site of death, compared with other non-cancer specialists.14 \n \n Methods Coping with Cancer was a federally funded, prospective, longitudinal, multi-institution cohort study of terminally ill cancer patients and their informal caregivers, which was designed to examine how psychosocial factors influence patients\u2019 medical care and caregivers\u2019 adjustment to bereavement.11 Of 917 eligible patients, 638 (69.6%) consented and enrolled in Coping with Cancer. The three most common reasons for non-participation were \u201cnot interested\u201d (n=120), \u201cother\u201d (n=69), and \u201ccaregiver refuses\u201d (n=37). Participants were more likely than non-participants to be Hispanic (12% (75/638) v 6% (16/279), P=0.006), but otherwise did not differ by sociodemographic characteristics. This report describes 386 patients who were recruited between October 2002 and February 2008 and died during the course of the study, such that we could analyze their end of life medical care. We excluded participants in clinical trials (n=37), as their treatment preferences and therapeutic expectations often differ from those of patients receiving standard chemotherapy or supportive care.17 Patients who had died as of February 28, 2008 did not differ significantly in type of cancer or receipt of chemotherapy from participants who lived. However, decedents had worse performance status, more symptoms, and greater awareness of terminal illness and were more likely to be male, unmarried, uninsured, less educated, younger, and non-white (all P<0.05). Participating sites included Yale Cancer Center, the Veterans Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System Comprehensive Cancer Clinics, the Parkland Hospital Palliative Care Service, Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and New Hampshire Oncology-Hematology. The Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center\u2019s Office for Human Research Studies coordinated the study, and all patients provided written informed consent. Patients were eligible to participate if they had metastatic cancer that had progressed through at least one chemotherapy regimen, had a physician formulated prognosis of six months or less to live, were aged at least 20 years, had an informal caregiver, and were assessed by clinic staff and interviewer as having adequate stamina to complete the interview. We excluded patient-caregiver dyads in which either the patient or the caregiver refused to participate, met criteria for dementia or delirium (by neurobehavioral cognitive status examination), or did not speak either English or Spanish. Patients participated in a baseline interview in English or Spanish for a $25 (\u00a315; \u20ac18) payment at a time that was close to when decisions about chemotherapy were being made. We reviewed medical charts at the time of study enrollment and recorded current use of chemotherapy. Research assistants confirmed patients\u2019 performance status and prognosis of six months or less with physicians. We did not record the number and length of previous and subsequent treatments. After each patient\u2019s death, we conducted a chart review and postmortem interview with the patient\u2019s caregivers to confirm the medical care received at the end of life, the patient\u2019s place of death, and whether the patient died in his or her preferred place of death. Main outcome measures The primary outcomes were end of life treatment and location of death. We determined use of intensive interventions in the last week of life (that is, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, or both) and location of death (intensive care unit, hospital, nursing home, inpatient hospice, or home) through a medical chart review and interviews with caregivers. Secondary outcome measures Survival\u2014We abstracted the time from study enrollment to death from medical charts. Late hospice referrals\u2014We determined the duration of hospice services through chart review and interviews with caregivers. We defined late referrals to a hospice as one week or less before death.11 Attainment of preferred place of death\u2014In postmortem interviews, we asked caregivers, \u201cDo you think that the place of death was where the patient would have most wanted to die?\u201d Patients whose caregivers responded \u201cyes\u201d were designated as having died where they wanted to. Primary independent variable of interest We reviewed medical charts on study enrollment to determine whether patients were receiving chemotherapy, radiation, pain management, or treatment on a clinical trial at the time of enrollment. Patients receiving chemotherapy as any part of their treatment, outside of a clinical trial, were included in the chemotherapy group. Additional covariates measured at baseline Sociodemographic characteristics\u2014Patients reported sex, age, marital status, race/ethnicity, religion, health insurance coverage, and last grade completed in school. Health status measures\u2014We measured patients\u2019 functional status with the Karnofsky score and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status,18 comorbid medical conditions with the Charlson Comorbidity Index,19 and quality of life with the McGill Quality of Life Index.20. Treatment preferences, terminal illness acknowledgment, coping, communication, and advance care planning\u2014We used validated measures to elicit patients\u2019 preferences for chemotherapy, mechanical ventilation, admission to an intensive care unit near death, and life extending care versus comfort care.21 22 We also assessed patients\u2019 acknowledgment of terminal illness, as this has been associated with higher rates of advance care planning and hospice use.23 The Brief COPE and RCOPE surveys assessed active, emotion focused, maladaptive, and positive religious coping with cancer related stress.24 We also asked patients whether they recalled having an end of life discussion with their physician,11 had a strong therapeutic alliance with their providers,25 and had completed a living will, durable power of attorney, or do not resuscitate order (see web appendix). Statistical analyses We used t test, \u03c72, and Fisher\u2019s exact statistics, as appropriate, to test for significant associations between patients\u2019 baseline characteristics and the receipt of chemotherapy at study enrollment. We used multiple imputation to impute missing data for items other than the dependent variables (for which no data were missing in our cohort)26; item non-response was less than 14% for all variables. We used propensity score analyses to assess the association between patients who were or were not receiving chemotherapy at the time of enrollment.27 To do the propensity score analysis, we first used logistic regression to assess the association of all measured demographic, clinical, psychosocial, and institutional characteristics with being treated with chemotherapy at baseline. The model included age, sex, marital status, insurance status, education, race/ethnicity, religion, institution, cancer type, Karnofsky and ECOG scores, Charlson Comorbidity Index, McGill Quality of Life Index subscales, patients\u2019 treatment preferences and advance care planning, terminal illness acknowledgment, therapeutic alliance with physicians, end of life discussions, and coping styles. For each patient, we used the regression coefficients and the observed covariates to calculate the propensity to receive chemotherapy at study enrollment and derived individual weights equal to the probability of belonging to the opposite group (that is, not receiving chemotherapy).11 28 Thus, after propensity adjustment the weighted distribution of characteristics in both groups were balanced. We then used a generalized linear regression model with an identity link function and a binomial distribution, with the propensity weighted cohorts, to estimate the association of chemotherapy with binary outcomes (for example, cardiopulmonary resuscitation and/or mechanical ventilation). Our events were rare, so we calculated and reported our results as adjusted risk differences as odds ratios may exaggerate the actual risk. We did a sensitivity analysis to examine the effect of excluding covariates that might change over time (Karnofsky score, ECOG score, McGill Quality of Life scales, treatment preferences, and terminal illness awareness), as the exact date of starting palliative chemotherapy was not ascertained during the baseline assessment. We used Cox proportional hazard models to compare the overall survival of patients who were receiving palliative chemotherapy with those who were not, with adjustment for propensity weights. We used SOLAS for Missing Data Analysis version 4.0 for multiple imputation and SAS version 9.2 for statistical analyses. We present two sided P values without adjustment for multiple comparisons; we considered P<0.05 to be significant. \n \n Results The cohort consisted of 386 terminally ill cancer patients who died a median of 4.0 (interquartile range 1.8-8.3) months after enrollment in the study. Overall, 56.0% of participants were receiving palliative chemotherapy on study enrollment. As shown in table 1\u21d3, patients who were receiving palliative chemotherapy were more likely to be younger, married, insured, and better educated and to have better performance status, overall quality of life, physical functioning, and psychological wellbeing compared with patients who were not receiving chemotherapy (all P\u22640.04). They were also more likely to express a preference to receive \u201clife extending\u201d care over comfort care (39% v 26%, P=0.01), including chemotherapy if it might extend their life by one week (86% v 60%, P<0.001), compared with those not receiving chemotherapy. Table 1 Participants\u2019 characteristics by chemotherapy at study enrollment. Values are numbers (percentages) unless stated otherwise View this table: Patients receiving palliative chemotherapy were less likely to acknowledge that their illness was terminal (35% v 49%, P=0.04) and to report having discussed their end of life wishes with a physician (37% v 48%, P=0.03), compared with those who were not. They were also less likely to have completed a do not resuscitate order (36% v 49%, P<0.05). Propensity score weighting successfully balanced all of the observed differences in patients\u2019 characteristics between the two groups (table 1\u21d1). In propensity score weighted analyses, receipt of chemotherapy at enrollment was associated with significantly more intensive medical interventions near death. As shown in table 2\u21d3, patients receiving palliative chemotherapy were more likely to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, or both in the last week of life (14% v 2%; adjusted risk difference 10.5%, 95% confidence interval 5.0% to 15.5%) compared with those who were not. Chemotherapy use was also associated with higher rates of use of a feeding tube in the last week (11% v 5%; adjusted risk difference 7.1%, 1.7% to 12.5%) and of late hospice referrals (54% v 37% enrolled within one week of death; 13.6%, 3.6% to 23.6%). In adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, we found no significant difference in overall survival between patients who were receiving palliative chemotherapy at study enrollment and those who were not (hazard ratio 1.11, 95% confidence interval 0.90 to 1.38). In a secondary model, we assessed the association between receipt of palliative chemotherapy and the intensity of end of life medical care without including characteristics that might have changed since the decision to start palliative chemotherapy was made (that is, performance status, quality of life, treatment preferences, and terminal illness acknowledgment), and the results did not change. Table 2 Associations between chemotherapy at study enrollment and intensity of end of life care. Values are numbers (percentages) unless stated otherwise View this table: As shown in table 3\u21d3, patients who received chemotherapy at enrollment were more likely to die in an intensive care unit (11% v 2%; adjusted risk difference 6.1%, 1.1% to 11.1%) and less likely to die at home (47% v 66%; \u221210.8%, \u22121.0% to \u221220.6%), compared with those who were not. Patients who were receiving palliative chemotherapy on study enrollment were also less likely die in their preferred place, compared with those who were not (68% v 80%; adjusted risk difference \u22129.4%, \u22120.8% to \u221218.1%). In a second model, we examined the association between palliative chemotherapy and patients\u2019 place of death without including characteristics that might change over time; our results were consistent, except that patients\u2019 likelihood of dying in their preferred place was no longer statistically significant (P=0.07). Table 3 Associations between chemotherapy at study enrollment, place of death, and attainment of preferred place of death. Values are numbers (percentages) unless stated otherwise View this table: \n \n Discussion Our results suggest that terminally ill patients with advanced cancers who receive chemotherapy a few months before death are more likely to receive intensive care at the end of life, compared with patients who do not. In this study, the use of chemotherapy a median of 4.0 months before death was associated with an increased risk of undergoing mechanical ventilation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or both in the last week of life and of being referred to a hospice late, both of which have been associated with worse quality of life for patients at the end of life,11 29 30 more distress in bereaved caregivers, 11 29 and higher costs.31 The use of palliative chemotherapy was also associated with an increased risk of dying in an intensive care unit, a decreased likelihood of dying at home, and a lower likelihood that patients died in their preferred place. Comparison with other studies This is the first study, to our knowledge, to examine the associations between the use of palliative chemotherapy and patients\u2019 location of death. Whereas previous studies have identified patient, caregiver, and system level factors that influence where cancer patients die,32 33 34 few have focused on how the care that terminally ill cancer patients receive in the final months of life relates to their place of death outside of hospice or palliative care settings.35 In this study, only a minority of terminally ill cancer patients preferred life extending medical care over care that focused on relieving pain and discomfort. However, more than half wanted chemotherapy if it would extend their life by one week, including 60% of patients who were not receiving chemotherapy. This finding is consistent with previous studies that have shown that many cancer patients are willing to undergo significant treatment related toxicities for small objective benefits.36 37 The one week survival threshold for chemotherapy that we observed is significantly lower than the four to five month thresholds previously reported in similar populations of patients,37 38 39 and it suggests that cancer patients may not regard chemotherapy as burdensome because they are willing to receive it for very limited temporal pay-off. Our findings also underscore the challenge that many oncologists face when discussing the option of stopping chemotherapy with patients and their caregivers,40 particularly when patients\u2014and physicians\u2014may equate stopping treatment with \u201cgiving up\u201d or \u201cdoing nothing.\u201d41 42 In this study, we observed significant differences in the rates of use of chemotherapy by institution, although they were balanced after propensity weighting and therefore did not influence the observed associations between receipt of chemotherapy and patients\u2019 end of life medical care and place of death. Although our study could not directly compare the relative influences of patient, provider, and institution level factors, we suspect that a combination of these factors explains the differences observed. Future studies should examine the most important determinants of end of life use of chemotherapy. In this study, we did not observe a difference in survival between patients who received palliative chemotherapy and those who did not. This should not be interpreted as evidence that palliative chemotherapy is futile in terminally ill cancer patients, as our analysis was limited to small sample of decedents and may have excluded patients who benefited most from chemotherapy. Instead, this finding should serve as a reminder that palliative chemotherapy does not necessarily extend life, but is associated with more intensive end of life care and increased risk of dying in an intensive care unit, so continuing treatment should not come at the cost of engaging in advance care planning.14 15 Strengths and limitations This study has several important strengths. Previous studies have found that older patients who received chemotherapy within two weeks of death had higher rates of emergency department visits and hospital admissions and decreased hospice use at the end of life.6 7 43 Our data, collected more than a decade later, extend these results by examining associations between palliative chemotherapy given months before death, at the time when most decision making about chemotherapy occurs, and the intensity of patients\u2019 end of life medical care and place of death. Our study may also be more representative of the care provided to \u201cdying patients\u201d than previous work because it enrolled patients of all ages who were prospectively identified by their physicians as terminally ill with a prognosis of six months or less to live.44 45 In addition, we had comprehensive data on patients\u2019 performance status, physical functioning, quality of life, and many other psychosocial factors associated with end of life decision making, including patients\u2019 treatment preferences, awareness of terminal illness, and end of life discussions with physicians,11 22 23 46 which are rarely available in other databases. The study also has limitations. Most notably, we did not have any information about the timing or nature of patients\u2019 decisions about treatment after study enrollment, except for the last week of life. However, subsequent decisions to resume or stop chemotherapy would minimize differences between the two groups, making detection of the effects observed less likely. Despite this, we observed significant associations between the use of palliative chemotherapy and the intensity of patients\u2019 end of life care and place of death, and our results did not change when we removed characteristics that often change in response to chemotherapy (such as quality of life and performance status) or disease progression (such as treatment preferences and awareness of terminal illness). However, the association between receipt of palliative chemotherapy and patients\u2019 preferred place of death became marginally significant in sensitivity analyses and when we included additional covariates in propensity weighted models; thus, future studies should confirm these results in larger populations. In addition, we did not have information about patients\u2019 baseline preferences for the timing of referral to a hospice or place of death. Although short hospice stays\u2014and treatment in an intensive care unit near death\u2014may be viewed as beneficial to dying patients or their family caregivers,47 our previous work suggests that for most patients these outcomes are associated with worse quality of life for patients and more distress in family caregivers six months after bereavement.11 29 In addition, we did not randomize patients to receive palliative chemotherapy or not. Whereas propensity score weighting can effectively adjust for observed differences, it can adjust for unobserved confounders only if they are associated with observed confounders. Furthermore, patients who were receiving chemotherapy at enrollment may have differed in unmeasured ways from those who were not receiving chemotherapy (for example, in their disease duration or previous experiences with chemotherapy). Finally, our analyses were limited to deceased patients who died in 2008, and only a small proportion of our patients experienced the end of life outcomes of interest. Nevertheless, the frequency of events we observed is comparable to or higher than those from population based studies using the most recent Medicare claims available. For example, Teno et al found that 6.7% of cancer patients received mechanical ventilation in the last month of life in 2009.48 In our study, 8.5% of terminally ill cancer patients received mechanical ventilation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the last week of life, but a significant difference existed between groups (13.9% v 1.6%) based on exposure to chemotherapy at baseline. Furthermore, we expect that our findings may be a conservative estimate, as Teno et al also found that the intensity of medical care near death is increasing over time.48 Conclusions and policy implications Our results suggest that less use of palliative chemotherapy among patients recognized to have a life expectancy of six months or less\u2014or more frequent end of life discussions in this group\u2014may reduce intensive end of life care and promote earlier access to hospice services, thus improving the quality of advanced cancer patients\u2019 end of life care. Future studies should determine the mechanisms by which palliative chemotherapy is associated with increased risk of receiving intensive care at the end of life and dying in an intensive care unit and examine explicitly whether palliative chemotherapy is associated with patients\u2019 goal attainment. Our study has important implications for oncology providers, patients with advanced cancer, and caregivers facing decisions about treatment. It suggests that end of life discussions may be particularly important for patients receiving palliative chemotherapy, who should be informed by data on the likely outcomes associated with its use. The findings also suggest the need for oncology providers to elicit patients\u2019 preferred site of death to ensure that patients\u2019 end of life experiences are congruent with their values.

(Associated Press) \n \n In the past months, rebels fighting to topple President Bashar Assad have frequently targeted military aircraft and air bases in an attempt to deprive his regime of a key weapon used to target opposition strongholds and reverse rebel gains in the 2-year-old conflict. \n \n The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights on Monday posted a video online showing several armed men standing in front of the wreckage. One of the fighters in the footage says it's a helicopter that the rebels shot down late Sunday in the eastern province of Deir el-Zour, along Syria's border with Iraq. \n \n As the man speaks, the camera shifts to a pickup truck piled with bodies. The fighter is then heard saying that all of Assad's troops who were aboard the helicopter were killed in the downing. He says Islamic fighters of the Abu Bakr Sadiqq brigade brought down the helicopter as it was taking off from a nearby air base in the provincial capital of Deir el-Zour. \n \n The Observatory, which relies on a network of activists on the ground, said eight troops were killed. \n \n On Sunday, rebels occupied parts of a military air base in northern Syria after days of fighting with government troops who were defending the sprawling facility near the border with Turkey for months, the Observatory said. \n \n Assad's warplanes were pounding rebel positions inside the Mannagh air base Monday as clashes between rebels and government forces raged on, the Observatory said, adding there was an unknown number of casualties on both sides. \n \n The day before, rebels moved deep into the air base despite fire from government warplanes, capturing a tank unit inside the base and killing the base's commander, Brig. Gen. Ali Salim Mahmoud, according to another activists group, the Aleppo Media Center. \n \n The fighting came hours after Israeli warplanes struck areas in and around the Syrian capital, setting off a series of explosions as they targeted a shipment of highly accurate, Iranian-made guided missiles believed to be bound for Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group, officials and activists said. \n \n The attack, the second in three days and the third this year, signaled a sharp escalation of Israel's involvement in Syria's civil war. Syrian state media reported that Israeli missiles on Sunday struck a military and scientific research center near Damascus and caused casualties. \n \n The Syrian conflict started with largely peaceful protests against President Bashar Assad's regime in March 2011, but eventually turned into a civil war that has killed more than 70,000 people according to the United Nations. \n \n More than one million Syrians have fled their homes during the fighting and sought shelter in the neighboring countries such as Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. Millions of others have been displaced inside Syria. ||||| Israeli public security minister Tzaji Hanegbi speaks at a news conference in Mexico City March 25, 2004. Hanegbi is in Mexico to speak with local and federal police chiefs. \n \n JERUSALEM Israel sought to persuade Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on Monday that its recent air strikes around Damascus did not aim to weaken him in the face of a more than two-year-old rebellion. \n \n Officials say Israel is reluctant to take sides in Syria's civil war for fear its actions would boost Islamists who are even more hostile to Israel than the Assad family, which has maintained a stable stand off with the Jewish state for decades. \n \n But Israel has repeatedly warned it will not let Assad's ally Hezbollah receive hi-tech weaponry. Intelligence sources said Israel attacked Iranian-supplied missiles stored near the Syrian capital on Friday and Sunday that were awaiting transfer to Hezbollah guerrilla group in neighboring Lebanon. \n \n Syria accused Israel of belligerence meant to shore up the outgunned anti-Assad rebels - drawing a denial on Monday from veteran Israeli lawmaker Tzachi Hanegbi, a confidant of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \n \n Interviewed on Israel Radio, Hanegbi said the Netanyahu government aimed to avoid \"an increase in tension with Syria by making clear that if there is activity, it is only against Hezbollah, not against the Syrian regime\". \n \n Hanegbi noted Israel had not formally acknowledged carrying out the raids in an effort to allow Assad to save face, adding that Netanyahu began a scheduled visit to China on Sunday to signal the sense of business as usual. \n \n \"DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS\" \n \n The Assad government has condemned the air strikes as tantamount to a \"declaration of war\" and threatened unspecified retaliation. \n \n But Hanegbi said Israel was ready for any development if the Syrians misinterpreted its messages and was ready \"to respond harshly if indeed there is aggression against us\". \n \n As a precaution, Israel deployed two of its five Iron Dome rocket interceptors near the Syrian and Lebanese fronts and grounded civilian aircraft in the area, although an Israeli military spokesman said the airspace would reopen on Monday. \n \n Yedioth Ahronoth, Israel's biggest-selling newspaper, said the Netanyahu government had informed Assad through diplomatic channels that it did not intend to meddle in Syria's civil war. \n \n Israeli officials did not immediately confirm the report, but one suggested that such indirect contacts were not required. \n \n \"Given the public remarks being made by senior Israeli figures to reassure Assad, it's pretty clear what the message is,\" the official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. \n \n Military analysts say Syria would be no match for Israel, a U.S. defense ally, in any confrontation. But Damascus, with its leverage over Hezbollah, could still consider proxy attacks through Lebanon, where Israel's conventional forces fought an inconclusive war against the Iranian-backed guerrillas in 2006. \n \n Tehran, which has long backed Assad, whose Alawite minority has religious ties to Shi'ite Islam, denied Israel's attack was on arms. Shi'ite Hezbollah did not comment. \n \n (Writing by Dan Williams; Editing by Jon Boyle) ||||| FILE -- In this Thursday, Nov. 15, 2012 file photo, the Iron Dome defense system fires to intercept an incoming missiles from Gaza in the port town of Ashdod, Israel.

    "document": "Scientists from Imperial College believe that intelligence may be influenced by two networks of genes, possibly controlled by a master regulatory system \n \n British scientists believe they have made a huge step forward in the understanding of the mechanisms of human intelligence. That genetic inheritance must play some part has never been disputed. Despite occasional claims later dismissed, no-one has yet produced a single gene that controls intelligence. \n \n But Michael Johnson of Imperial College London, a consultant neurologist and colleagues report in Nature Neuroscience that they may have discovered a very different answer: two networks of genes, perhaps controlled by some master regulatory system, lie behind the human gift for lateral thinking, mental arithmetic, pub quizzes, strategic planning, cryptic crosswords and the ability to laugh at limericks. \n \n Diverse parental genes lead to taller, smarter children, finds extensive study Read more \n \n As usual, such research raises potentially politically-loaded questions about the nature of intelligence. \u201cIntelligence is a composite measure of different cognitive abilities and how they are distributed in a population. It doesn\u2019t measure any one thing. But it is measurable,\u201d Dr Johnson said. \n \n About 40% of the variation in intelligence is explained by inheritance. The other factors are not yet certain. But the scientists raise the distant possibility that armed with the new information they may be able to devise ways to modify human intelligence. \n \n \u201cThe idea of ultimately using drugs to affect cognitive performance is not in any way new. We all drink coffee to improve our cognitive performance,\u201d Dr Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s about understanding the pathways that are related to cognitive ability both in health and disease, especially disease so one day we could help people with learning disabilities fulfil their potential. That is very important.\u201d \n \n The two networks, known just as M1 and M3, one with roughly 1000 genes, the other with more than a 100, also play a role in neurodevelopmental disorders such as epilepsy, schizophrenia and autism. The functions do not seem to overlap, and the role of each network has yet to be settled. \n \n \u201cWe know that genetics plays a major role in intelligence but until now haven\u2019t known which genes are relevant. This research highlights some of the genes involved in human intelligence and how they interact with each other,\u201d Dr Johnson said. \u201cWhat\u2019s exciting about this is that the genes we have found are likely to share a common regulation, which means that potentially we can manipulate a whole set of genes whose activity is linked to human intelligence.\u201d \n \n The discovery is testament to the power of patience, patients and the assembly of huge sets of data. The Imperial College scientists started with evidence from 100 mouse brains, 122 samples of human brain, and 102 whole human brains preserved postmortem. Such indicators of a genetic connection between neurodevelopmental problems or memory and understanding were then checked against records of 6,732 people in the \u201cGeneration Scotland\u201d family health study, which tracks the life history of thousands of volunteers, and repeated in 1,003 healthy people who had volunteered to take part in a study called the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936. \n \n Gene linked to long life also protects against mental decline in old age Read more \n \n It assessed a range of cognitive abilities \u2013 among them memory, attention, processing speed and reasoning \u2013 and then it combined the results with genetic information donated by healthy people who had taken IQ tests, and from people with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. Included in the research were studies of people who had undergone neurosurgery for epilepsy. \n \n Then the scientists then harnessed massive computing power to see what the data could tell them. They found that the genes that influenced the intelligence and ability of healthy people were the same ones that impaired cognitive ability and caused epilepsy when mutated. If researchers understand what may go wrong in the interplay of inheritance that delivers human reasoning or memory, they might \u2013 the possibility for the moment is only theoretical \u2013 be able to devise new ways to deliver help. \n \n \u201cTraits such as intelligence are governed by large groups of genes working together - like a football team made up of players in different position,\u201d he said. \u201cWe found that some of these genes overlap with those that cause severe childhood onset epilepsy or intellectual disability,\u201d \n \n The researchers may have identified a pool of players in a team: they still have to identify how the players co-operate, which are the key players and precisely what game is being played. \n \n \u201cEventually we hope that this sort of analysis will provide new insights into better treatments for neurodevelopmental disease such as epilepsy, and ameliorate or treat the cognitive impairments associated with these devastating diseases.\u201d \n \n \u2022 This article was amended on 29 December 2015 to remove a reference to autism as a neurodevelopmental illness; it is a disorder, not an illness. ||||| STRADL - Stratifying Resilience and Depression Longitudinally In 2014, the Wellcome Trust awarded \u00a34.8M to researchers in Edinburgh and Aberdeen to fund a study of depression using GS:SFHS.

Over the next five years, scientists will study individual groups of people who have known depression risk factors such as a family history of low mood, early life problems such as being born underweight or psychological trauma in childhood. Participants will asked to complete new questionnaires on their mental health and resilience.

Ben Cardin, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, exclusively told \"Fox News Sunday\" that President Trump bears responsibility for General Motors' decision last month to close five facilities and slash 15 percent of its North American salaried workforce. \n \n His comments echoed complaints by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was quoted by the Toronto Star at the G20 Summit in Argentina on Friday saying that GM's restructuring was \"all the more reason why we need to keep working to remove the tariffs on steel and aluminum between our countries.\" \n \n \"I do think the way the president has gone about the trade policies, imposing tariffs -- there\u2019s a consequence, there\u2019s a domestic consequence,\" Cardin told host Chris Wallace. \"And clearly General Motors' decisions are in part based upon the tariff issue, so yes it has an impact, and it costs us jobs here in America.\" \n \n The GM closures in Ohio, Michigan, Maryland and Ontario drew Trump's ire and led him to threaten to cut all subsidies for the largest American automaker. The layoffs could affect up to 14,000 employees. GM will also cease production of several car models, including the Chevrolet Cruze and the Buick LaCrosse. \n \n But Cardin sounded a positive note on the 90-day trade truce reached by Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, which brings a temporary halt to new tariffs between the U.S. and China, as well as the newly signed United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trilateral agreement. \n \n \"President Trump has agreed that on Jan. 1, 2019, he will leave the tariffs on $200 billion worth of product at the 10 percent rate, and not raise it to 25 percent at this time,\" the White House announced. \"Over the next 90 days, American and Chinese officials will continue to negotiate lingering disagreements on technology transfer, intellectual property and agriculture.\" \n \n CHINESE OFFICIAL SAYS TRUMP IS HARD TO READ, SAYS US WARSHIPS AT CHINA'S DOORSTEPS SPARK TENSION \n \n \"Clearly, it is encouraging to see that we're talking with the Chinese on the trade front,\" Cardin said. \"China has created many problems with trade, many obstacles for free trade. My concern about the president's trade policy is that his first action was to take tariffs against our closest allies based upon national security exceptions. We lost the unity that we needed in dealing with China.\" \n \n Speaking separately to \"Fox News Sunday,\" Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt called for more details on the China truce, but agreed with Cardin that the news was positive. \n \n \"People like me who have really been concerned about the president\u2019s stated trade policy can take some encouragement in what happened in the last couple of days, the signing of the U.S. Canada and Mexico agreement -- that\u2019s a big step that 6 months ago or even just a few weeks ago we were concerned that we would not be making that kind of progress,\" Blunt said. \n \n \"And on the Chinese front you are right, we need more specifics here,\" he added. \"I think it\u2019s hard to win a trade war, and I also think, though, that the facts on the table with China are stronger than any other country in terms of our legitimate concerns, and the more other things that the president can move off the table -- whether it's Canada or Mexico, the EU, Japan -- the more of those things he can move off the table, the more flexibility he has with China.\" \n \n The White House has bipartisan support for hitting back at Chinese intellectual property theft.

Bush after Bush criticized Cheney's role in his son's administration. \n \n The elder Bush, who died at 94 in his Houston home on Friday night, made several comments to presidential biographer Jon Meacham in his 2015 book, \"Destiny and Power: The American Odyssey of George Herbert Walker Bush,\" that were critical of Cheney's militaristic policy prescriptions after the 9/11 attacks. \n \n \"I don't know he just became very hard-line and very different from the Dick Cheney I knew and worked with,\" Bush said of Cheney, who served as his secretary of defense for his entire administration. \n \n More: George Bush's last day started with three eggs, ended with 'I love you' \n \n \"Just iron ass,\" Bush said of Cheney's attitude after the attacks. He decried Cheney's \"seeming knuckling under to the real hard-charging guys who want to fight about everything, use force to get our way in the Middle East.\" \n \n Bush was also critical of Cheney's autonomy as his son's vice president and the degree to which he expressed his views publicly. \n \n More: Here's why VP Mike Pence named George H.W. Bush as his role model for the No. 2 job \n \n \"He had his own empire there and marched to his own drummer,\" Bush said. \n \n \"Fox News Sunday\" host Chris Wallace asked Cheney about Bush's remarks to Meacham during a discussion of the 41st president's legacy. \n \n \u201cI was more, I guess, of an \u2018iron ass\u2019 when I was vice president,\" Cheney conceded. \"The thing that had intervened between my time at defense for 41 and my time as vice president was 9/11. We\u2019d had 3,000 of our people killed on 9/11, more people than we lost at Pearl Harbor and we moved, I think legitimately, into a war-time setting rather than simple law enforcement.\" \n \n Cheney said Bush reached out to smooth things over after his critical comments became public and sent him a note that said, \u201cDear Dick, I did it.\u201d \n \n \"And then he went on at great length to tell me what a great American I was,\" Cheney said. \n \n Cheney said Bush also invited him to sit at the head table at that year's Alfalfa Club dinner, one of the most exclusive annual events in Washington. \n \n \"That sort of dampened down the notion that there was some kind of fundamental break between Bush and Cheney,\" the former vice president said. \n \n More: Trump pardons Scooter Libby, the Cheney aide convicted of lying to the FBI \n \n More: Christian Bale transforms to a ruthless Dick Cheney in 'Vice' first trailer \n \n Read or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/12/02/bush-criticism-cheney/2183449002/",

But as the calendar turns to March 8, it\u2019s also time for the corporate pile-on of feel-good ads and product rollouts as brands rush to chime in on the pro-woman conversation. \n \n Mattel on Tuesday unveiled 17 new \u201crole model\u201d Barbies for the occasion, honoring female icons such as Amelia Earhart and NASA mathematician Katherine Johnson. Modern-day figures like Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins and Olympic snowboarder Chloe Kim also got their own lookalike dolls. \n \n During the Oscars on Sunday, Nike aired a new ad starring Serena Williams that commemorated International Women\u2019s Day. In the commercial, the tennis star says she\u2019s been criticized as not \u201cthe right kind of woman,\u201d but has learned that \u201cthere\u2019s no wrong way to be a woman.\u201d \n \n Read More: Why You Should Wear Purple on International Women\u2019s Day \n \n Uber released a video in Asian markets that seeks to disprove myths about female drivers there, and Facebook has designed IWD-themed cards, photo frames, and backgrounds to adorn text posts by users on mobile devices. \n \n In a wackier stunt, a California McDonald\u2019s location is turning its trademark golden arches upside-down so what is normally an M becomes a W for women. \n \n The history of International Women\u2019s Day stretches back more than a century, but supporting it in 2018 may feel especially urgent for brands, as it\u2019s the first IWD since the #MeToo movement went viral, prompting a much-needed reevaluation of how corporate America, Hollywood, and the media treat female employees. But even in the current climate, where the public seems especially receptive to messages of female empowerment, brands must tread carefully. There was criticism, for instance, that Mattel\u2019s \u2018role model\u2019 Barbies appear to fit the doll\u2019s trademark silhouette and the McDonald\u2019s W was panned by some on social media as an empty, odd symbol. \n \n Great job, feminism \u2014 we did it!!! pic.twitter.com/6ICfQbYuop \u2014 Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) March 7, 2018 \n \n The ongoing #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up movements may make it seem like celebrating IWD is a no-brainer for brands, but in fact, the campaigns against sexual harassment and sexism have raised the bar, says Erin Keeley, CMO at Mono, an ad agency. \n \n Messaging like the Nike ad is \u201cmotivational,\u201d Keeley says. Such ads \u201cmake you feel good; they are a positive message,\u201d she says. \u201cYou hate to say that you don\u2019t want brands to do that.\u201d But the dialogue around women\u2019s equality seems to be \u201cturning a corner,\u201d she says, where awareness and inspiration aren\u2019t enough. The conversation has moved on to action; into \u201cwhat happens next,\u201d she says. \n \n Subscribe to The Broadsheet, Fortune\u2019s newsletter for and about the world\u2019s most powerful women. \n \n That\u2019s a harder mission for brands, but Keeley says Getty Images seemed to pull it off during International Women\u2019s Day 2017, when it announced that it was launching a female-focused sports photography internship with the goal of adding more diversity to the field and contributing \u201cto a more positive portrayal of sportswomen in the media.\u201d \n \n In that same vein, commentators commended Frances McDormand for including in her Oscars acceptance speech an actionable step\u2014demanding an inclusion rider\u2014that actors could take to change the industry; she went beyond just girl-power cheerleading. \n \n Read More: See Photos of the Women\u2019s Rights Movement Dating Back 100 Years \n \n The IWD conversation is also one that not every brand has to join. Tapping into IWD makes sense \u201cif your brand is about progress; if it\u2019s aligned with what\u2019s happening that day,\u201d Keeley says. \n \n But even for those companies, IWD can be a prickly occasion to celebrate. \n \n Liquor company Diageo tried to promote the progressive history of its Johnnie Walker brand in late February when it introduced its limited edition \u201cJane Walker\u201d scotch whisky, its traditional Johnny Walker bottle with a female iteration of the brand\u2019s Striding Man logo. Sale of Jane Walker is tied to Women\u2019s History Month and International Women\u2019s Day. In introducing the new bottle, the company touted the near equal gender make-up of its expert blenders and the women in its leadership ranks. \u201cWomen have played a significant role in the brand\u2019s history dating back to 1893,\u201d the company said in a release. But a quote by the brand\u2019s vice president\u2014\u201cScotch as a category is seen as particularly intimidating by women\u201d\u2014riled critics, including late-night host Stephen Colbert, who gave it the monologue treatment: \u201cThey changed the name to Jane Walker with a lady version of the mascot.

These new dolls are a direct response to this anxiety. \u201cWe are thrilled to shine a light on real life role models to remind them that they can be anything,\u201d Lisa McKnight, SVP and GM of Barbie, said in a statement announcing the collection. \n \n At first blush, the toy brand has done an admirable job of highlighting inspirational women of many different ethnicities from around the world who have an impressive array of achievements. There\u2019s Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins from the United States, two Michelin-star French chef H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Darroze, and Chinese ballerina Yuan Tan. There are even historical icons like artist Frida Kahlo, NASA mathematician Katherine Jenkins, and pilot Amelia Earhart. \n \n And some even come with props! Olympic gold medalist Chloe Kim has her own snowboard, Australian conservationist (and Steve Irwin\u2019s daughter) Bindi Irwin comes with a koala bear, and Chinese volleyball champion Hui Ruoqi has a ball in tow. \n \n The dolls\u2019 faces, eye colors, and hairstyles appear carefully designed to capture the likenesses of the real woman each is meant to represent. But for all this attention to detail, it seems strange that Mattel made all the dolls rail thin. In fact, the dolls\u2019 bodies are almost identical each another\u2013which is the first tip-off that something is amiss. Irwin\u2019s doll is a little shorter than her counterparts, while Ruoqi\u2019s is slightly taller, and Spanish entrepreneur Vicky Martin Berrocal\u2019s is a smidge curvier, but there is nothing realistic about these dolls at all. \n \n It\u2019s an odd move for Mattel. Since 2009, Barbie sales have spiraled downward. Between 2012 and 2014 alone, the brand\u2019s sales plummeted by 20%. While part of this shift has to do with kids preferring electronic toys over analog ones, analysts say that part of the decline is due to parents who believe Barbie is a bad influence on girls. A slew of research has found that playing with Barbie makes girls feel lower self-esteem about their bodies. ||||| If you\u2019ve visited Google, you\u2019ll know that Wednesday\u2019s Doodle honors International Women\u2019s Day! \n \n The Google Doodle, which can be viewed around the world, is an interactive feature on the website\u2019s homepage that features stories from \u201ceveryday women,\u201d including 12 female artists of varying backgrounds to celebrate women\u2019s social, economic, and political achievements as well as to address gender equality. \n \n International Women\u2019s Day was founded more than a century ago after more than 15,000 women marched in New York City to demand better working conditions and voting rights. \n \n This year, the company collaborated with Tunalaya Dunn, Kaveri Gopalakrishnan, Anna Haifisch, Isuri, Saffa Khan, Laerte, Estel\u00ed Meza, Karabo Poppy Moletsane, Philippa Rice, Francesca Sanna, Chihiro Takeuchi and Tillie Walden to mark International Women\u2019s Day 2018, which is officially celebrated on March 8. \n \n In addition, their inspiring messages have been translated into more than 80 languages. \n \n It's officially #IWD2018 in the \ud83c\udf0e\ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0f!

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Thursday is International Women's Day, an annual event getting more attention than usual in 2018 because it's the first in the wake of the #MeToo movement. As expected, brands (including McDonald's) are looking to capitalize, though critics are calling out examples of perceived misfires. Here's a look at what's going on in the US and around the world: Obituaries: One of the more interesting efforts comes from the New York Times, which acknowledges that it has focused too much on men in its obituaries over the years. A new project, \"Overlooked,\" seeks to correct that by catching up on obits that should have been done but weren't. Subjects now getting their due include poet Sylvia Plath, anti-lynching crusader Ida B. Wells, and Jane Eyre author Charlotte Bronte. Branding: At the Financial Times, Kate Allen thinks the move by McDonald's to flip its arches into a W is \"possibly the most superficial approach to gender politics in the universe.\" Nor is she a fan of the stunt by French newspaper Liberation to charge male readers more on Thursday. \"There are various ways to highlight the gender pay gap, but this is a vastly oversimplified one to pick.\" Branding, II: Fortune looks at other corporate efforts, including Mattel's \"role model\" Barbies, also being panned.

Three hours after they were sent, riot police officers pushed past barricades of burned buses at that site and were met by a crowd of protesters in ski masks and bicycle helmets, carrying sticks and ready to fight. \n \n The police fired plastic bullets and threw stun grenades. They pressed as far as a cobblestone-throwing catapult built by protesters the day before and dismantled it before retreating. \n \n The opposition leaders who are members of parliamentary factions face a difficult choice over whether to embrace or denounce the more radical groups as the demonstrations grow more violent. So far, the politicians have condemned those fighting with the police as not representing the aspirations of the larger number of peaceful protesters who have gathered in Independence Square since November in support of closer economic integration with the European Union. \n \n Photo \n \n Some of those fighting the police, carrying baseball bats and throwing gasoline bombs say they are supporters of the European free-trade agreement whose rejection by Mr. Yanukovich set off the protests. \n \n But other groups have also appeared in Kiev, adding to the sense of chaos. Young men carrying sticks wandered side streets near the central square threatening to beat protesters who walked alone.

Yanukovich is pretending he does not see us or hear us,\" said Vasyl Somkovych, 30, a protester from the region of Ivano-Frankivsk in largely pro-European western Ukraine. \n \n In Kiev, a presidential aide ruled out the declaration of a state of emergency to quell the unrest. \n \n Asked by a journalist if the presidency was considering such a step, Andriy Klyuev, secretary of the National Council of Security and Defense, said: \"There will be no declaration of a state of emergency. \n \n On Tuesday, 2,000-3,000 protesters faced about 1,000 police in central Kiev, where Reuters reporters saw nine burnt-out buses and trucks, smoke wafting from some of the tyres. \n \n Cobblestones were strewn across a main street where violence erupted on Sunday. Priests were among people walking in an area between a police line and a protesters' barricade. \n \n Police periodically beat their shields with truncheons and constantly boomed out warnings to protesters through megaphones. \n \n \"We will act according to the situation,\" said Sergei, 45, a protester from western Ukraine. \"If the OMON (riot police) attack, we will respond with full force.\" \n \n (Editing by Gareth Jones and Janet Lawrence) nL5N0KV115 ||||| KIEV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych refused to meet Tuesday with an opposition leader who came to his office hoping for negotiations, dimming hopes for a resolution soon to the political crisis that has escalated into vicious street clashes between protesters and police. \n \n Protesters burn car tires as they clash with police in central Kiev, Ukraine, early Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2014.

(Associated Press) \n \n Ukraine's two-month standoff shifted into a new phase after Yanukovych pushed through harsh anti-protest laws last week in an attempt to quash the demonstrations calling for his ouster. The mass protests in Kiev, the capital, erupted after Yanukovych spurned a pact with the European Union in favor of close ties with Russia, which offered him a $15 billion bailout. \n \n Seeing the government ignore their demands and opposition leaders unable to present a coherent plan or even select a single leader, radical protesters have clashed with riot police in Kiev since Sunday, hurling stones and fire bombs at police and getting hit with tear gas and rubber bullets in return. \n \n \"A revolution is under way in Ukraine,\" said Petro Denkovets, 34, an entrepreneur. \"What revolution takes place peacefully? Each side is showing its strengths. The government, its troops, and we, our fearlessness.\" \n \n In a bid to ease the crisis, opposition leader Vitali Klitschko, who is a heavyweight boxing champion, went to Yanukovych's office for face-to-face talks on Tuesday, but was received only by his aides. The aides were part of a working group that Yanukovych told to hold negotiations with the opposition. \n \n Yanukovych's office said the president was in a meeting at the time. But Klitschko held out hope that the leader would receive him later Tuesday. \n \n \"The center of the city of Kiev has been burning for two days,\" a disappointed Klitschko said. \"The president sits two blocks away and does not hear it.\" \n \n Despite heavy snowfall and freezing temperatures, several thousand protesters remained camped outside a government district in Kiev in front of rows of helmeted riot police who hid behind metal shields. Charred buses stood covered with ice, the ground was dotted with stones and the popular rock song \"I will not give up without a fight\" blared over the crowd. \n \n The protesters had managed to hold their ground overnight, even as police moved in to dismantle some barricades. Fighting lulled on Tuesday morning, after Orthodox priests intervened and asked both sides for calm. \n \n Still, nearly 1,500 activists sought medical help after the clashes, according to Oleh Musiy, who runs the protesters' medical team. \n \n Opposition leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk, who had previously condemned violent protests, said the situation has changed. \n \n \"People have received the right to switch from peaceful to non-peaceful protest because the deafness of the authorities and their disregard for the people,\" he said Tuesday. \n \n His ally, the jailed former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, also urged Ukrainians to go to the barricades. \n \n \"There is no other way for the people to deal with the mafia. Those standing on the front lines for Ukraine are heroes!\" Tymoshenko said in a statement. \n \n Heeding the call, young women worked Tuesday to clear the protest site of debris. Nearby, middle-aged men and women produced a drum beat of protest by hitting metal barrels and shields with sticks. In one dramatic scene, three black-robed Orthodox priests, holding crosses and icons, walked in between the police and the protesters, causing the fighting to stop. \n \n During the clashes Monday night, Klitschko claimed that groups of young men had been hired by pro-government forces to smash shop windows and set cars ablaze in Kiev to create a pretext for the government to introduce martial law. \n \n Protesters chased the men around, captured them and took them to be questioned. In a video broadcast by several Ukrainian media organizations, the activists showed a hammer and other tools used by the assailants. The protesters then marched the captives down the street and forced them to apologize. \n \n Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, meanwhile, accused the West of instigating the protests and some EU politicians of joining them. \n \n \"We would prefer that our European colleagues, at least some of them, don't behave in such an unceremonious way in connection with the Ukrainian crisis,\" he said. \"It's simply unseemly and this is what is heating up the situation.\"",

But the attempt to scare away protesters didn't work\u2014clashes with police continued in Kiev.

The nurse who was convicted of killing patients in Germany with overdoses of heart medication is now believed to have killed at least 84 people... (Associated Press) \n \n BERLIN (AP) \u2014 A male nurse who was convicted of killing patients in Germany with overdoses of heart medication is now believed to have killed at least 86 people \u2014 and the true scale of the killings could be even larger, investigators said Monday. \n \n Many of the deaths could have been prevented if health authorities had acted more quickly on their suspicions, said Johann Kuehme, police chief in the northwestern city of Oldenburg. \n \n Niels Hoegel, now 40, was convicted in 2015 of two murders and two attempted murders at a hospital in the northwestern town of Delmenhorst. He was sentenced to life in prison. But prosecutors have long said they believe he killed many more people, last year putting the figure at 43 at least. \n \n The crimes came to light after Hoegel was convicted of attempted murder in another case. Authorities subsequently investigated hundreds of deaths, exhuming bodies of former patients in Delmenhorst and nearby Oldenburg. \n \n Kuehme said Monday that authorities have now unearthed evidence of 84 killings in addition to the ones for which Hoegel was convicted. The number of actual killings is likely higher because some possible victims were cremated, making it impossible to gather evidence, Kuehme added. \n \n \"Eighty-four killings ... leave us speechless,\" Kuehme told reporters. \"And as if all that were not enough, we must realize that the real dimension of the killings by Niels H. is likely many times worse.\" \n \n The fact that the cases go back many years and people may struggle to remember the exact details of their loved ones' deaths hurts authorities' ability to determine an exact number, Kuehme said. \n \n He faulted local health authorities for being slow to act. \n \n \"If the people responsible at the time, particularly at the Oldenburg clinic but also later in Delmenhorst, hadn't hesitated to alert authorities \u2014 for example police, prosecutors \u2014\" Hoegel could have been stopped earlier, Kuehme said. \n \n Authorities are already pursuing criminal cases against former staff at the two facilities. \n \n Hoegel worked at the Oldenburg hospital from 1999 to 2002 and in Delmenhorst from 2003 to 2005. \n \n Kuehme said other medical workers at Oldenburg were aware of an elevated number of resuscitations, and initial indications of possible wrongdoing by the nurse in Delmenhorst emerged as early as April 2003. \n \n During his trial, Hoegel had said he intentionally brought about cardiac crises in some 90 patients in Delmenhorst because he enjoyed the feeling of being able to resuscitate them. \n \n He later told investigators that he also killed patients in Oldenburg. \n \n Prosecutors are expected to try Hoegel on at least some of the additional killings but Germany's judicial system does not allow for consecutive sentences, so future convictions won't affect his life term. \n \n The identities of the suspected 84 victims haven't been released. There was no immediate comment Monday from any representatives of victims' families.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 He has been convicted of killing two and attempting to murder two more\u2014and he could actually be \"Germany's worst post-war killer,\" reports the BBC. Niels Hoegel, 40, was sentenced to life in prison in 2015 for those crimes, but prosecutors voiced their belief that the nurse had killed many more while working at clinics in Oldenburg (from 1999 to 2002) and Delmenhorst (from 2003 to 2005), reports the AP. Now police are giving a sense of just how many more: at least 84. Hoegel said at trial that he wanted to play the hero and drugged his patients so that he could then resuscitate them and win praise. Except a commission established three years ago to determine the breadth of his crimes has found that many patients ended up receiving lethal doses of drugs that brought on heart failure or destroyed the circulatory system. The BBC reports that 134 bodies have been exhumed and tested for traces of the drug, but \"it is simply not possible to say how many people were killed,\" per Oldenburg police chief Johann Kuhme. That's in part because many of his patients were cremated.

    "document": "SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email \n \n President-elect Donald Trump, who won the hearts and minds of millions of working-class voters, may help deliver a multibillion-dollar bonanza to America\u2019s wealthiest families. \n \n The Manhattan businessman\u2019s election offers congressional Republicans their best chance in years to eliminate the estate tax, which he and others call the \u201cdeath tax.\u201d Abolishing it would save more than $20 billion a year for the millionaires and billionaires the tax applies to -- including the Trump family and several of the people he has chosen for his administration. \n \n \u201cA lot of families go through hell over the death tax,\u201d Trump said during his presidential run. The tax\u2019s opponents say it forces some families to sell their farms or small businesses in order to pay up. Studies suggest that only a small percentage of estates fall into those categories. \n \n Wiping out the estate tax has been a longstanding goal for Republican lawmakers, and the party\u2019s sweeping victories in the 2016 election have brought them thrillingly close to achieving it. But there are potential stumbling blocks. Their narrow margin in the Senate leaves few votes to spare. And Trump may have a hard time reconciling his populist campaign themes with a tax break for America\u2019s richest. \n \n Under federal law, the tax, which is levied at a 40 percent rate, applies only to estates worth more than $5.45 million for individuals and $10.9 million for couples. Estates worth less than that may be passed on to heirs tax-free. Last year, just 0.2 percent of estates of people who died were subject to the tax, according to estimates by the Tax Policy Center, a Washington-based research group that\u2019s a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. \n \n \u2018The Forgotten Guy\u2019 \n \n Trump \u201ccampaigned as someone who\u2019s going to help the middle class, the forgotten guy, but every policy he\u2019s advocating -- huge tax cuts for the wealthy, estate tax -- all for the top .001 percent,\u201d said Representative Jerry Nadler, a Democrat from Manhattan. \n \n America\u2019s wealthiest \u201chit the jackpot\u201d with Trump\u2019s election, he said. \n \n Since Trump\u2019s election, House Ways & Means Chairman Kevin Brady and Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch have repeated their desire to repeal the estate tax. House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have long supported its elimination. Passage in the Republican-led House is assured. In the Senate, a decade-long estate tax repeal can pass with 50 of 52 expected GOP senators under a special mechanism called reconciliation, while 60 votes could end it for good. \n \n \u201cThe death tax on family farms, small businesses, ranches and estates has crippled hard-working families for far too long,\u201d Hatch told Bloomberg News in a statement. \n \n In 2013, 120 of the 3,780 estates subject to the tax were farms and businesses, according to the Tax Policy Center. That\u2019s a little more than 3 percent. The same year, estates valued above $20 million paid an average tax rate of 18.8 percent -- many achieve a lower effective rate through tax-planning strategies, including giving some of their fortune away to charity. \n \n Windfall to Leaders \n \n At that 18.8 percent effective rate, repealing the tax would be a large windfall to the leaders-in-waiting of the Trump administration. \n \n Trump\u2019s estate would save $564 million, based on his estimated net worth of $3 billion. Trump disagrees with that net-worth estimate, which Bloomberg News compiled in July; he has said his net worth exceeds $10 billion. If so, his savings would increase -- to as much as $1.9 billion at an 18.8 percent effective tax rate. Trump\u2019s transition team didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment for this story. \n \n Trump\u2019s Commerce secretary choice, Wilbur Ross, might save about $545 million, based on his estimated net worth of $2.9 billion. Ross is the chairman and chief strategy officer of WL Ross & Co. LLC. Richard DeVos, the father-in-law of Trump\u2019s education secretary choice Betsy DeVos, might save $900 million, based on his estimated $4.8 billion net worth. Richard DeVos is co-founder of Alticor Inc., the parent of closely held direct-seller Amway Corp. Linda McMahon, Trump\u2019s pick to head the Small Business Administration, and her husband, Vince McMahon, who together founded World Wrestling Entertainment Inc., might save more than $250 million based on their shared net worth of at least $1.35 billion. The nominees\u2019 net worth estimates were compiled by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. \n \n Repealing the tax would also benefit Treasury secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin, who held shares in CIT Group Inc. worth more than $100 million as of Dec. 2. And Gary Cohn, who is said to be Trump\u2019s choice for his chief economic policy adviser, would leave his position as president of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. with $266 million of stock and awards amassed during his years at the investment bank, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \n \n Early Test \n \n The looming estate-tax debate may be an early test of how Republicans deal with the electorate\u2019s populist-over-elite mood. In interviews, Republican senators and congressmen played down the tension between Trump\u2019s populist image and repealing the estate tax. \n \n \u201cEvery president who\u2019s ever had the office is going to have tension between their campaign and reality,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican. \u201cHow he handles that tension is up to him. But there\u2019s nothing new about a president campaigning one way and having to govern another.\u201d \n \n Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, said on Thursday he expects an estate tax repeal to be included in the budget reconciliation beginning in April. Others want it to be part of a comprehensive tax overhaul package. GOP aides said many are waiting for guidance from Trump. \n \n Some conservatives caution that upper-end tax breaks are politically problematic. \n \n \u201cTrump would do well to craft a tax-reform agenda that is populist in a very visible, obvious way that delivers tangible gains to middle-income voters,\u201d said Reihan Salam, executive editor of the National Review, a conservative magazine. \u201cI believe that coming right out of the gate and focusing on high-end tax cuts might prove costly.\u201d \n \n Democratic Opposition \n \n Democrats overwhelmingly oppose reducing the tax \u2014 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton campaigned on raising its rate to 65 percent for couples worth $1 billion. \u201cI\u2019m against\u201d repealing the tax, said incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. \u201cTo do it would sure help out the wealthiest few in America.\u201d \n \n GOP leaders are thus wary of over-promising. \u201cEvery tax bill is going to have a lot of tension and a lot of problems because the Democrats are not real enthused about things,\u201d Hatch said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to see. But we may be able to do some things.\u201d \n \n The politics of repeal may depend on which description of the tax reaches the public. A Gallup poll in March found that 54 percent of Americans favored eliminating it when told it\u2019s a tax paid when a person dies. But researchers have found that people are more likely to support it -- and to want it to be increased -- when told who it affects. \n \n \u201cIt becomes a question of how effective Democrats are at reframing that issue beyond this notion of a death tax,\u201d said Norman Ornstein, a political analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. \n \n \u2014 With assistance by Brendan Coffey ||||| Highlighted areas show what parts of President Trump\u2019s 2005 tax return could have been affected by the new tax plan. \n \n President Trump could cut his tax bills by more than $1.1 billion, including saving tens of millions of dollars in a single year, under his proposed tax changes, a New York Times analysis has found. \n \n On Wednesday, the White House announced a sweeping plan to cut a variety of taxes that would overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy. The estimate of Mr. Trump\u2019s savings is based in part on information from his 2005 federal tax return. The analysis compares what his tax burden would be under current law with what it would be under the proposal. \n \n Mr. Trump\u2019s 2005 return is the most recent available publicly and was released in March by David Cay Johnston on the website DCReport.org. The Times\u2019s figure also relies on an estimate of Mr. Trump\u2019s net worth, calculated by the Bloomberg Billionaire\u2019s Index to be $2.86 billion. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t benefit. I don\u2019t benefit,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Wednesday. \u201cIn fact, very, very strongly, as you see, I think there\u2019s very little benefit for people of wealth.\u201d \n \n In fact, high-income earners like Mr. Trump are likely to benefit disproportionately if the White House proposal becomes law. The estimates, calculated with the help of Robert Willens, an accounting expert, and Stephen Breitstone, a tax lawyer, provide a view into precisely how. \n \n Savings of about $1.1 billion from repealing the estate tax \n \n Though it would not be reflected on his income tax return, Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to eliminate the estate tax would generate the largest tax savings. If his assets \u2014 reportedly valued at $2.86 billion \u2014 were transferred after his death under today\u2019s rules, his estate would be taxed at about 40 percent. Repealing the federal estate tax could save his family about $1.1 billion, though it could still be subject to New York estate taxes. \n \n Savings of $31 million from repealing the alternative minimum tax \n \n Line 45 of Mr. Trump\u2019s 2005 tax return shows he paid $31.3 million because of the alternative minimum tax. \n \n The decades-old alternative minimum tax is meant to prevent America\u2019s wealthiest from using deductions to pay very low or no federal income tax. In 2005, it accounted for about 80 percent of Mr. Trump\u2019s overall income tax payment. His plan to repeal the tax would save him $31.3 million. \n \n Savings of about $16 million from taxing certain types of business income at 25 percent \n \n Lines 12 and 17 of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax return show the income he earned from businesses, rental real estate and other kinds of business partnerships, totaling $109.76 million. \n \n Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed changes could allow individuals to qualify for a significantly reduced tax rate of 25 percent on certain types of income they receive through business partnerships and similar entities. That is up from the original proposal in April of 15 percent, but far lower than the top tax rates currently faced by high-income earners of 39.6 percent. \n \n Mr. Trump could save as much as $6.2 million on business income and $9.8 million on income from real estate and other kinds of partnerships under this plan, compared with his tax burden under current law. (In 2005, much of this taxable income was offset by a $103.2 million write-down in business losses.) \n \n The proposal released Wednesday \u201ccontemplates\u201d that Congress will adopt measures to prevent the wealthy from recharacterizing their income to take advantage of the new, lower rate and avoid the top personal rate. If that happens, it could have a big effect on Mr. Trump\u2019s tax bill. \n \n Savings of about $0.5 million from cutting the highest tax rate \n \n Lines 7, 8a and 9a show $10.79 million in wages, taxable interest and ordinary dividends that Mr. Trump earned in 2005. \n \n The proposal to reduce the highest tax rate to 35 percent from 39.6 percent would save high-income earners similar to Mr. Trump a relatively small amount compared with the repeal of the alternative minimum tax. The $500,000 in savings is a rough estimate because Mr. Trump has not specified income levels for his proposed tax brackets. \n \n Increase of $3 million to $5 million in taxes from repealing most deductions \n \n Line 40 shows Mr. Trump itemized his deductions instead of using the standard tax deduction, claiming $17 million. \n \n Mr. Trump would probably lose most of the deductions he reported in 2005. Depending on his effective tax rate under the proposal, Mr. Trump could pay roughly $3 million to $5 million more in taxes. ||||| President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans unveiled Wednesday their plan for a massive tax overhaul. \n \n The plan, meant to be a framework for Congress to negotiate into legislation, still has missing parts. But read on for a look at who wins and loses under the proposal as it stands now. \n \n Winners \n \n Corporations with high tax rates: The framework lowers the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. Trump initially wanted to lower it to 15 percent but said his \u201cred line\u201d for the rate is 20. \n \n It also lowers the tax rate for small businesses to 25 percent. The majority of small business owners would use the extra cash to expand businesses and hire additional employees, Alfredo Ortiz, president of the nonprofit Job Creators Network, told Fox News. \n \n Heirs to large estates: The plan eliminates the so-called death tax, or estate tax. The federal estate tax, which typically affects wealthier Americans, is a tax on property transferred after the owner\u2019s death. \n \n People who do their own taxes: With the framework, Republicans hoped to simplify the tax code and the way Americans file their taxes. The plan collapses the number of brackets from seven to as little as three. \n \n High-income households: The framework includes multiple tax cuts for high-income taxpayers, including the elimination of the Alternative Minimum Tax. The AMT is a supplemental income tax meant to offset benefits a person with a high economic income could receive. \n \n Low-income households: The plan doubles the standard deduction, which reduces the amount of taxed income, to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for married couples, making low-income taxpayers a winner, Steve Odland, CEO of the Committee for Economic Development, told Fox News. \n \n It also increases the child tax credit which could be beneficial to families. \n \n Losers \n \n Taxpayers in high-tax states: The plan eliminates state and local tax deductions, meaning taxpayers in states with high taxes will lose out on the write-off. This impacts those in mostly blue states, such as California and New York. \n \n Congressional New York Republicans have warned that they will not vote for a plan that includes the removal. \n \n Accountants: Because the plan would streamline the tax process, less people would potentially need to hire tax accountants, lawyers and firms, Odland predicted. \n \n Trump has said he wants to put H&R Block \"out of business.\" \n \n National debt: The plan would result in approximately $2.2 trillion of net tax cuts -- a blow to the national debt, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said. \n \n \u201cGiven today\u2019s record-high levels of national debt, the country cannot afford a deficit-financed tax cut,\u201d the nonprofit said. \n \n Social programs: With the greatly reduced amount of tax collections the plan calls for, it\u2019s possible that domestic spending on programs such as welfare programs and education could take a hit, Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told Fox News. \n \n People who want a concrete plan: Aaron also said the plan was lacking in details, making it difficult for policy experts to come up with concrete estimates of the framework\u2019s impact. \n \n \u201cPeople can make assumptions about what the details will be and make estimates based on their assumptions, but you won\u2019t really know until the details are in,\u201d he said.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It's hard to know for sure, but President Trump may save a pretty penny if his administration's \"once in a generation\" tax proposal goes into effect, despite Trump insisting earlier this week the plan is \"not good for me.\" The New York Times put Trump's estimated net worth of $2.86 billion and his 2005 federal tax return\u2014one of the few publicly available pieces of detailed info on the president's finances\u2014up against the current tax law and the new plan. Its findings: The president and his estate could save more than $1 billion. Experts commissioned by the Times postulate the benefits would mostly come from the elimination of the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax. Under the current estate tax, Trump's estate would take a 40% hit following an assets transfer after his death. In what it called a potential \"bonanza\" for Trump and his Cabinet members, Bloomberg last year estimated Trump's family would save $564 million by dumping the estate tax; the Times figures it closer to $1.1 billion, minus New York state taxes. Getting rid of the AMT, which made up about 80% of Trump's income tax payment in the 2005 return, could save him more than $31 million.

    "document": "Secret files exposing evidence of widespread match-fixing by players at the upper level of world tennis can today be revealed by BuzzFeed News and the BBC. \n \n The sport\u2019s governing bodies have been warned repeatedly about a core group of 16 players \u2013 all of whom have ranked in the top 50 \u2013 but none have faced any sanctions and more than half of them will begin playing at the Australian Open on Monday. \n \n \n \n It has been seven years since world tennis authorities were first handed compelling evidence about a network of players suspected of fixing matches at major tournaments including Wimbledon following a landmark investigation, but all of them have been allowed to continue playing. \n \n \n \n The investigation into men\u2019s tennis by BuzzFeed News and the BBC is based on a cache of leaked documents from inside the sport \u2013 the Fixing Files \u2013 as well as an original analysis of the betting activity on 26,000 matches and interviews across three continents with gambling and match-fixing experts, tennis officials, and players. \n \n The files contain detailed evidence of suspected match-fixing orchestrated by gambling syndicates in Russia and Italy, which was uncovered in the landmark 2008 probe, and which authorities subsequently shelved. \u201cThey could have got rid of a network of players that would have almost completely cleared the sport up,\u201d said Mark Phillips, one of the investigators. \u201cWe gave them everything tied up with a nice pink bow on top and they took no action at all.\u201d \n \n BuzzFeed News began its investigation after devising an algorithm to analyse gambling on professional tennis matches over the past seven years. It identified 15 players who regularly lost matches in which heavily lopsided betting appeared to substantially shift the odds \u2013 a red flag for possible match-fixing. \n \n Four players showed particularly unusual patterns, losing almost all of these red-flag matches. Given the bookmakers\u2019 initial odds, the chances that the players would perform that badly were less than 1 in 1,000. (Read more about the analysis here.) \n \n Tennis is the latest sport to be caught up in allegations of corruption following the scandals that have engulfed world football and athletics. \n \n \n \n It can today be revealed: \n \n Winners of singles and doubles titles at Grand Slam tournaments are among the core group of 16 players who have repeatedly been reported for losing games when highly suspicious bets have been placed against them. \n \n One top-50 player competing in the Australian Open is suspected of repeatedly fixing his first set. \n \n Players are being targeted in hotel rooms at major tournaments and offered $50,000 or more per fix by corrupt gamblers. \n \n Gambling syndicates in Russia and Italy have made hundreds of thousands of pounds placing highly suspicious bets on scores of matches \u2013 including at Wimbledon and the French Open. \n \n \n \n The names of more than 70 players appear on nine leaked lists of suspected fixers who have been flagged up to the tennis authorities over the past decade without being sanctioned. \n \n Nigel Willerton, who leads the Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU) set up to enforce fair play following the 2008 investigation, acknowledged that authorities had drawn a line under the evidence uncovered in the 2008 probe. The leaked files show that investigators implicated 28 players in suspected fixing and urged that they face a full disciplinary investigation. But Willerton said that tennis authorities took no action against them. \n \n Players are being targeted in hotel rooms at major tournaments and offered $50,000 or more per fix by corrupt gamblers. ID: 7783665 \n \n He said the evidence was shelved because lawyers had advised that a new integrity code introduced in the wake of the investigation could not be enforced retrospectively. \u201cAs a result,\u201d he said, \u201cno new investigations into any of the players who were mentioned in the 2008 report were opened.\u201d \n \n Match-fixing has been explicitly outlawed by every previous version of the rules enforced by the game\u2019s governing bodies. Moreover, since the new code took effect, tennis authorities have been warned that at least nine of the players who escaped further investigation have continued to play in suspicious matches. \n \n Willerton insisted that the sport takes \u201ca zero-tolerance approach to all aspects of betting-related corruption\u201d and that \u201call credible information received by the TIU is analysed, assessed, and investigated by highly experienced former law-enforcement investigators.\u201d And he pointed out that the Tennis Integrity Unit has disciplined 13 male players (all low-ranking) for fixing and banned five for life even though, Willerton said, prosecuting corruption cases is \u201cnotoriously difficult\u201d. \n \n \u201cI can assure you that tennis is not treating this lightly,\u201d said Chris Kermode, the president of the Association of Tennis Professionals, which governs the men\u2019s game, last night. \u201cThe idea that tennis is not acting appropriately is ludicrous.\u201d \n \n But, as the 2016 Grand Slam season begins on Monday with the Australian Open, former integrity chiefs from within world tennis are breaking ranks to accuse the sport of failing to stamp out match-fixing. \n \n Among them is Ben Gunn, the former police chief who led the review that recommended the formation of the integrity unit after the 2008 probe. He said the authorities had missed a \u201cperfect opportunity\u201d to clean up the sport and instead created a feeble and understaffed integrity unit that ignored key betting evidence. \u201cWhat they did is a plastic solution which was not effective then and it\u2019s not effective now,\u201d he said. \n \n Richard Ings, the former executive vice president for rules and competition at the Association of Tennis Professionals, said that match-fixing was a \u201cregular thing\u201d in the sport. He said the integrity unit\u2019s response to the problem has been \u201cvery disappointing\u201d and it is \u201cfar too secretive\u201d. \n \n \n \n The 2008 probe was triggered by a notorious match between the world number four, Nikolay Davydenko, a Russian, and the Argentine player Martin Vassallo Arguello, which attracted millions of pounds\u2019 worth of highly suspicious betting triggered by accounts in Moscow. \n \n The tennis authorities announced at the end of the investigation that they had found no evidence of rule-breaking by Vassallo Arguello or Davydenko. But the files reveal that Vassallo Arguello had exchanged 82 text messages at a previous tournament with the suspected ringleader of an Italian gambling syndicate that made hundreds of thousands of pounds betting on his other matches. Inquiries into the Russian gamblers who placed suspicious bets on Davydenko stalled when one threatened violence. These Italian and Russian gambling syndicates and another in Sicily were found to have placed suspicious bets on 72 matches involving the 28 players that the investigators flagged to the authorities. \n \n Weeks after tennis authorities were handed the evidence, Bill Babcock, the head of the International Tennis Federation\u2019s Grand Slam committee, declared that tennis was \u201chealthy\u201d and there was no corruption inside the sport. But the Fixing Files show that allegations of widespread corruption have continued to pour into the integrity unit in the years since. \n \n The whistleblowers from inside world tennis who handed over the Fixing Files have asked to remain anonymous. But Phillips and two other investigators who conducted the probe said the evidence they found was \u201cas strong as any evidence we\u2019ve had\u201d and the authorities \u201cdid nothing\u201d. \n \n In all, more than 20 gambling industry officials, international police detectives, and sports integrity experts told BuzzFeed News that world tennis is failing to confront a serious problem with match-fixing. BuzzFeed News and the BBC have chosen not to name the players whose matches have repeatedly been flagged for attracting highly suspicious betting, because without access to phone, bank, or computer records it is not possible to prove a link between the players and the gamblers. The integrity unit has the power to demand all that evidence from any tennis professional, yet many of the individuals whose activity attracted the most serious concern are still playing at a high level. Meanwhile, tennis has grown to a multibillion-dollar global phenomenon. \n \n Today the secret evidence of corruption at the heart of the \u201cgentlemen\u2019s game\u201d can be laid bare for the first time. \n \n Peter Andrews / Reuters Czarek Sokolowski / ASSOCIATED PRESS Nikolay Davydenko of Russia (left) in the 2 August 2007 match against Martin Vassallo Arguello of Argentina (right) at the Orange Prokom Open ATP tennis tournament in Sopot, Poland. ID: 7783601 \n \n In pristine whites, Nikolay Davydenko looked in typically commanding form as he stepped out onto the clay court in Sopot, Poland, to defend his title as reigning champion of the Orange Prokom tournament. It ought to have been an easy victory: Davydenko was the world\u2019s fourth-best tennis player, while his Argentine opponent, Martin Vassallo Arguello, languished far below him at number 87 in the rankings. \n \n The wiry Russian played all his usual penetrating groundstrokes to win the first set and swiftly broke his opponent\u2019s serve in the second. To the fans enjoying Polish kabanos sausages in the stands, play seemed to be progressing exactly as anyone would have expected. \n \n But before the first ball had even been struck at the match on 2 August 2007, warning lights had begun flashing on the monitoring systems at the Betfair gambling exchange in London. Hundreds of thousands of pounds had begun flooding into the market that morning, backing Vassallo Arguello to win. By any objective measure Davydenko was the near-certain victor, but the amount of money stacking up against him was so significant that the odds had tipped to make his opponent the favourite to win. \n \n Even after play began and Davydenko went a set and a break up, still greater sums of money continued crashing in against him. In total, \u00a33.6 million was wagered on the game \u2013 more than 10 times the usual volume of cash for a tournament at that level \u2013 and much of the money being bet against the Russian was coming in from nine linked accounts registered to users in Moscow. Everything in the rankings and the way play was progressing on court pointed towards a resounding victory for Davydenko, and yet the Russian account holders seemed sure he would lose. What did they know that the bookmakers didn\u2019t? \n \n Davydenko (right) receives treatment on his foot during his second-round match with Vassallo Arguello at the Prokom Open, 2 August 2007. Czarek Sokolowski / ASSOCIATED PRESS ID: 7783612 \n \n Alarmed, the head of Betfair\u2019s anti-corruption team in London picked up the phone to Gayle Bradshaw, the executive vice president of the Association of Tennis Professionals, to tell him something deeply suspicious was happening in Sopot. From the ATP\u2019s office in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, Bradshaw got straight on the phone to the tournament supervisor in Poland, who rushed down to the courtside to watch the rest of the match. No sooner had he arrived than the contest took a dramatic turn. \n \n Davydenko suddenly began hobbling. He repeatedly requested medical time-outs, complaining of pain in his ankle and then his toe, and he lost the second set to Vassallo Arguello. Three games into the third set, he threw in the towel and announced he was forfeiting the game due to injury. \n \n Immediately after he walked off court, Betfair suspended the market and later announced \u2013 for the first time in its history \u2013 that all bets placed on the game were void. The market, it said in a statement, \u201cquite clearly wasn\u2019t fair\u201d. It promised to turn over all its betting records to the tennis authorities. \n \n The move caused a global sensation, and Davydenko was engulfed by the first major match-fixing scandal to hit world tennis. From the outset, the Russian insisted he was innocent. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to throw a match,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI know that if you are in pain and can\u2019t play on, you withdraw.\u201d But the game had been shaken to the core, and the ATP announced it would conduct a full investigation. \n \n Matt Chase for BuzzFeed News ID: 7783605 \n \n Betfair and other bookmakers had been warning the ATP of the threat of gambling corruption in tennis for several years before the situation came to a head in Sopot. \u201cThis was something that we had been watching build,\u201d recalled Betfair\u2019s co-founder Mark Davies. \n \n Bosses at the betting exchange felt they had to protect honest bettors who could lose huge sums of money if corrupt gamblers were rigging the market. Crisis talks were convened in London. \n \n Six or seven players, including Davydenko and Vassallo Arguello, had repeatedly attracted suspicious betting activity, Davies recalled, and the management committee decided to take a drastic step: They would suspend all bets on those players. \n \n The ATP\u2019s own Richard Ings, who served as the association\u2019s executive vice president for rules and competition until 2005, had compiled a list of 20 players who had been implicated in suspicious matches flagged by bookmakers \u2013 including both Davydenko and Vassallo Arguello. \u201cThere were consistently matches across the depth and breadth of men\u2019s pro tennis with extremely suspicious shifts in betting odds,\u201d Ings told BuzzFeed News and the BBC. \u201cWhat became very clear is that, whilst there were lots of matches with suspicious betting patterns, you tended to see the names of the same players cropping up again and again.\u201d \n \n Players were widely rumoured to be \u201ctanking\u201d \u2013 deliberately forfeiting matches by not giving their best efforts \u2013 when they were tired or carrying minor injuries and wanted to preserve their energy for more important tournaments. Sometimes, it was said, players would carve up the spoils of victory: One would deliberately lose but get to keep the prize money, while the other would win and bag the coveted ranking points. Now, however, the ballooning phenomenon of online gambling meant billions of pounds were being bet each year on tennis, and a tip about a player\u2019s intention to tank a match could yield vast winnings. Prize money at lesser tournaments can be paltry, and a year on the tennis tour can set a player back more than \u00a3100,000, making it tempting to cash in on the occasional fix. \n \n \u201cIf you were to invent a sport that was tailor-made for match-fixing, the sport that you would invent would be called tennis.\u201d ID: 7783669 \n \n Ings recalled that he had talked to a \u201cgreat many players\u201d about the problem and it became clear that fixing was \u201ca regular thing within the sport\u201d. He said five or so players told him they had been approached and offered sums \u201cin the vicinity of fifty-thousand U.S. dollars to throw a first-round match at a middle-level ATP tournament\u201d. \n \n He began to realise that tennis was particularly vulnerable to corruption because tens of thousands of matches are played each year, with billions of pounds at stake on the gambling markets, and it only took one player to fix the outcome. \u201cIf you were to invent a sport that was tailor-made for match-fixing, the sport that you would invent would be called tennis,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take much effort on a player to throw a match without the opponent or the officials or the fans or even the media being aware. Where it does become apparent is in the betting market.\u201d \n \n Ings had wanted to find out why the same names kept cropping up in bookmakers\u2019 reports of suspicious matches, but at that time officials lacked the power to investigate further. \u201cIdentifying whether someone has fixed a match is incredibly difficult without betting records, without access to telephone records, without access to financial transactions,\u201d he said. So Ings introduced a new anti-corruption code that compelled players to hand over their phone and bank records to the ATP if they were suspected of fixing matches. Those powers were to be crucial in investigating the match in Sopot. \n \n Matt Chase for BuzzFeed News ID: 7783606 \n \n A team of former detectives and betting investigators from the British Horseracing Authority \u2013 whose integrity unit was considered the gold standard in world sport \u2013 were recruited by the ATP to get to the bottom of the Sopot mystery. They set up a temporary office on Shaftesbury Avenue in London\u2019s theatre district, where they were led by Paul Scotney, the horseracing authority\u2019s integrity director; Paul Beeby, its head of intelligence; and Phillips, its top betting investigator. \n \n \n \n Scotney and Beeby were a pair of veteran organised crime detectives who in retirement had turned their hand to policing gambling corruption. \u201cWhen you go to a murder scene and there\u2019s a body, you know someone\u2019s dead,\u201d Scotney told BuzzFeed News. \u201cOn some betting markets you know there\u2019s a body, and the Davydenko match was one of those. The odds just did not match with their rankings at all, and the amount of money that had gone into Betfair was totally disproportionate.\u201d \n \n While his colleagues set about preparing to interview the players and their entourages, Phillips was tasked with analysing the gambling data. He quickly found that about a fifth of the \u00a33.6 million traded on the Betfair exchange had flooded in from a network of nine Moscow accounts, which were accessed from the same group of computers. \u201cThis strongly suggests that either all accounts were being controlled by one person or that the account holders were \u2018working\u2019 together,\u201d Phillips noted in his formal statement to the ATP. \n \n \n \n BuzzFeed News ID: 7783611 \n \n The betting odds should have reflected the fact that Davydenko was a far stronger player and had won the whole tournament in Sopot the previous year, but the sums of money bet against him were so vast that before play had even begun the odds were stacked heavily in Vassallo Arguello\u2019s favour. By the time Davydenko was up two games to one in the first set, Phillips reckoned that Vassallo Arguello\u2019s odds to win should have been around 5/1, which meant anyone betting on him would win \u00a35 for every \u00a31 wagered. Such odds would have implied a 17% chance that Vassallo Arguello would defeat Davydenko. But just 15 minutes into the match, one of the Russian accounts took odds for Vassallo Arguello\u2019s victory at just 1/7, suggesting nearly 90% probability the underdog would win and only \u00a31 could be won for every \u00a37 bet on him. \n \n \n \n Phillips concluded: \u201cIn almost 20 years of working in the gambling industry, as an on-course bookmaker, an odds compiler/trader, and as a betting investigator, I have never seen a match or race where so much of the money wagered was done at such unrealistic odds and by linked accounts.\u201d \n \n The betting analyst was then tasked with examining which other matches the Moscow ring had been betting on. His main brief was to crack the Sopot case, but he also took a wider look at suspect gambling patterns he was seeing on tennis matches across the Betfair exchange. \n \n Meanwhile, the former detectives were tracking down the owners of the nine suspicious accounts. With the help of Betfair, they were traced to an affluent area of Moscow, and in January 2008, the investigators began calling the individual bettors. \n \n The first account holder to pick up was a 31-year-old Muscovite called Julia Tsoy who had bet more than \u00a3260,000 against Davydenko by the time he had won the first set and would have almost doubled her money had Betfair not voided the market. She was hesitant in answering questions but acknowledged that she knew two of the other account holders. She said she researched the players from publicly available information before the match and had seen articles about Davydenko\u2019s injuries. Then she told the investigators they needed to speak to her fianc\u00e9, Rustem, if they wanted to know more. \n \n \n \n Rustem Ersainov owned at least two of the other accounts that had stood to make a huge profit on Davydenko\u2019s loss, and he had started betting one minute after his fianc\u00e9e had finished. He refused to talk about the bets he had placed and instead raged about Betfair\u2019s decision to void the market. The investigators went on to contact the other Moscow gamblers but found them impossible interviewees. \u201cThe account holders were all drunk when we phoned them,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cOne of them said people are going to get hurt over this. Some of them got angry, and some of them were just laughing.\u201d \n \n The computer sharing evidence, the betting patterns, and the interviews led the investigators to conclude that Ersainov was likely to be the ringleader in Moscow. They also found that the accounts he controlled had bet heavily on a string of suspicious matches involving other high-ranking players. \n \n \n \n But shortly after the phone calls, Ersainov got in touch with Betfair and threatened \u201cphysical harm\u201d to its main account manager in Russia if it didn\u2019t call off the ATP investigators. Immediately, Betfair moved the manager out of the city. Neither Ersainov nor Tsoy could be reached for comment by BuzzFeed News. \n \n The Betfair integrity unit were furious that the manager in Moscow had been put at risk. \u201cWe had advised the investigators how to approach the account holders, but they went in with their size 12s,\u201d one source recalled. The unit\u2019s manager wrote a stern email to the investigators. He said that Tsoy, another account holder, \u201cand, in particular, Mr Rustam are three of our clients who did not wish to be contacted by the ATP\u201d and that \u201cthe first two were cordial to you, but the last has provided us with an unequivocal warning that physical harm will be done to our employee. It is a significant problem which needs the sting taking out of it promptly in order to best help protect our employee. Would it be possible to send them a letter, at the soonest opportunity, apologising for contacting them?\u201d \n \n The manager got a terse email back from Beeby, reluctantly agreeing to send the letter, but complaining: \u201cI have some serious concerns about what has been happening here,\u201d adding that \u201cI don\u2019t think we needed to apologise to anyone for the action we took.\u201d \n \n BuzzFeed News ID: 7783614 \n \n The blockage in Moscow was a major setback to the investigation \u2013 particularly because Phillips was unravelling a trail leading from the Russian betting ring to a whole range of other suspicious matches where the account holders appeared to have used inside information to bet heavily on a particular player to lose. The investigators were becoming increasingly certain that what had apparently happened in Sopot was going on around the world. And it wasn\u2019t just the Russian account holders cashing in. Phillips was confident he was closing in on evidence that gambling syndicates in north Italy and Sicily were also profiting on inside information. \n \n He noted a clear pattern in the way play progressed during these matches that mirrored what had gone on in Sopot. \u201cThey were the set-and-break mob,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cThe favourite will win the first set and go a break up in the second so the money comes in and the odds on him are as high as they can be \u2013 and then they\u2019ll lose all their games from then on. That\u2019s how it works.\u201d \n \n Meanwhile, the former detectives had also interviewed everyone connected with the match in Sopot. They spoke to the match umpire, who said Davydenko had not shown any sign of intending to throw the match during play, and the crowd had clearly not suspected anything untoward. \u201cIf he did tank the match he did it in a professional way and with style,\u201d according to the report on what the umpire said. But the ATP manager who had rushed down to courtside after receiving the warning from Betfair noted that \u201cit was very strange to see Mr Davydenko playing all return games in a very relaxed way and never getting close to break point.\u201d \n \n \n \n The physiotherapist who had attended to the Russian during his repeated medical time-outs told the investigators that the player had remarked: \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of staying on? The hard-court season is coming up.\u201d Davydenko had then asked what the physiotherapist considered a \u201cstrange\u201d question about his foot: \u201cIs this a medical reason to retire?\u201d He answered that it was, and Davydenko played three more games before pulling out. It seemed to the investigators as if his mind was made up that he wasn\u2019t going to carry on playing some time before he withdrew. \n \n If he did tank the match, the referee noted, he did it in a professional way and with style. ID: 7783675 \n \n An examination of the player\u2019s medical records found that he had been diagnosed with an inflamed tendon in his foot, a common complaint among tennis players, three days before the match against Vassallo Arguello. Davydenko\u2019s managers told the media that he had subsequently been diagnosed with a stress fracture. But while several doctors confirmed he had visited them shortly after the match, this diagnosis was not found in his records. \n \n \n \n The detectives interviewed the Russian tennis star at the Sheraton Hotel at Frankfurt Airport in September 2007 along with his wife, his brother, and his coach. He denied having any relationship with the Russian account holders or being involved in any gambling. No one had approached him in advance about the Sopot match, and he hadn\u2019t told anyone that he would retire injured. But he acknowledged he had told some other players, his wife, and his brother that he was carrying a foot injury. According to the notes of the interview, he said it was \u201cnormal, during a small tournament, that players might not try so hard during a match if they had an injury or, if there was a big tournament (such as a Grand Slam) coming up.\u201d But this, he insisted, was not what had happened in Sopot. He also said he barely knew his opponent and they had not communicated before the match. \n \n The player\u2019s wife said she had not spoken to anyone about her husband\u2019s foot injury. But his brother, Eduard, said he often received phone calls from journalists asking about Davydenko\u2019s form and whether he was injured before a match, and that the player \u201cdoes not keep his injuries quiet when speaking with Russian supporters\u201d. \n \n Davydenko declined to hand over his mobile phone \u2013 or those of his wife and brother \u2013 for forensic examination. On the advice of his lawyer, he resisted handing over his call records for so long that, by the time he was compelled to release them, much of the data was irretrievable. Investigators also suspected that he used more than one phone. \u201cThe situation with obtaining Davydenko\u2019s complete telephone billings and/or an explanation for other phones he was suspected of using has not satisfactorily been resolved,\u201d they noted. \n \n \n \n The Russian\u2019s lawyer, meanwhile, was fulminating about the way the investigators had treated his client. \u201cWhat has happened here to Nikolay is just incredible,\u201d Frank Immenga told ESPN. \u201cFrom the first day, he was pushed into the corner and treated like a criminal.\u201d \n \n \u201cI know that my client is truly innocent, so they will reveal nothing,\u201d he said in another interview. \u201cDavydenko was hurt; he had something on his foot; this was already seen before the match,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere are people looking for information \u2026 When they find out that somebody is already hurt they are going to bet against him. That is exactly what happened.\u201d \n \n Vassallo Arguello, too, leapt to the defence of his opponent. \u201cI don\u2019t think the investigation is going to show that Davydenko was involved in anything,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cEverything that happened on the court seemed very normal to me.\u201d \n \n ID: 7783642 \n \n Davydenko\u2019s Argentine opponent also denied in his interview with investigators that he had ever discussed the outcome of a match with anyone connected with betting, though he acknowledged gambling on soccer and women\u2019s tennis. Unlike his opponent, however, Vassallo Arguello handed over his phone, and that of his coach. This led to a series of discoveries. \n \n \n \n The first was a mobile number stored under the name Davydenko \u2013 which was curious because the Russian had said he and his opponent did not know each other. The rest of the discoveries were about matches that had nothing to do with Davydenko and, the investigators felt sure, would \u201cform the basis for future investigations concerning this player\u201d. \n \n The detectives found that Vassallo Arguello had the numbers of several Italian Betfair account holders in his phone memory. The investigators sent the phone for forensic examination, which revealed text messages that the Argentine had deleted. Experts were able to recover the first few words of each of them. \n \n Meanwhile, Phillips had identified a ring of Sicilian account holders who had cashed in on suspicious matches Vassallo Arguello had played during a previous European tournament. As with the Russian accounts, these were connected by computer sharing, suggesting to Phillips that they were being controlled by one person. The analysis of Vassallo Arguello\u2019s phone showed he had exchanged 82 text messages with one of the account holders, a 43-year-old man called Fabrizio Guttadauro living in Sicily. And the phone numbers of other account holders were stored on Vassallo Arguello\u2019s phone. \n \n \n \n The first contact with Guttadauro was the day before an early match when Vassallo Arguello received a text message from him. As with all the deleted messages, investigators were only able to retrieve the first few words. They read: \u201cThis is my number, please if\u2026\u201d Then on the day of the match, Vassallo Arguello received another text: \u201cAre you awake? Can I call you? Room 1.\u201d Two more messages followed: \u201cDon\u2019t call from the mobile but from the room,\u201d and \u201cI would like to talk to you because of the match.\u201d \n \n To the investigators, it appeared that the two had then discussed the outcome on their hotel phones and agreed that Vassallo Arguello would approach his opponent, because at 1:15pm he texted the Sicilian with disappointing news: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to do it. He intends to win and force\u2026\u201d But then 11 minutes later he sent another message: \u201cI\u2019ll come,\u201d and, a little after that, \u201cAll okay.\u201d The four Sicilian accounts then bet heavily on Vassallo Arguello to win the match. His opponent won the first set before losing in the second and third. The Sicilian bettors won more than \u00a3300,000 off the back of Vassallo Arguello\u2019s victory. \n \n The phone records revealed Vassallo Arguello had texted both the suspected Sicilian fixer and his opponent about the outcome of another match during the same tournament. The night before the game, the Argentine received a text from the player he was due to face saying simply, \u201cWhere are you?\u201d Twenty minutes later, he texted Guttadauro, saying, \u201cHe\u2019s replying to me this evening.\u201d Later, the other player texted Vassallo Arguello giving his room number and asking, \u201cCan we talk?\u201d It was impossible to know what the opponents had discussed, but the following morning Vassallo Arguello sent another frustratingly truncated message to the Sicilian. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken with [him]. He asked me for a\u2026\u201d it said. \n \n Sicilian money poured into the Betfair exchange before and during the match, and Vassallo Arguello lost heavily. As well as Guttadauro, the investigators linked another of the account holders to a number stored in the player\u2019s phone. After the match, the other player texted Vassallo Arguello: \u201cMartin, we have to talk. These guys are\u2026\u201d Four hours later, Vassallo Arguello wrote to Guttadauro, \u201cUnfortunately he can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d \n \n Reached by BuzzFeed News, Guttadauro initially said he did not know Vassallo Arguello and claimed his phone must have been hacked during the tournament. Then he called back, wanting to know if it was the Argentine who handed over his number, and whether he was in trouble with the FBI. He refused to answer any questions about his communications with the player, but added that under the right circumstances he might be able to provide \u201ca scoop\u201d. \u201cYou can make me an offer,\u201d he said, \u201cand then maybe I can tell you many more things.\u201d \n \n When they saw the text messages, the investigators told BuzzFeed News they thought the combination of the phone records and the betting patterns they had observed was \u201ca smoking gun\u201d. They found a further five highly suspicious matches played by Vassallo Arguello, on which the north Italian and Sicilian betting rings had gambled heavily. \n \n Overall, the Russian and Italian gambling syndicates had bet on more than 72 matches in a way that Phillips thought looked overtly corrupt. There were 28 players whom Phillips suspected of rigging the outcome of those matches, with a core of 10 against whom he felt the case was overwhelming. And these were not all obscure games at small-time tournaments. Three of them had taken place at Wimbledon, and one was at the French Open. \n \n BuzzFeed News ID: 7783628 \n \n Phillips prepared a report on the three suspected gambling syndicates in the spring of 2008. \u201cIt was absolutely conclusive to me that the players in my final report were fixing,\u201d he told BuzzFeed News. He said he put in only the most egregious matches, but there were 40 or 50 more that he considered highly suspicious. \n \n As for the gamblers apparently cashing in on the games, Phillips had found 11 highly suspicious Betfair accounts in Russia and concluded: \u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that these accounts are in receipt of inside information, at the very least, regarding Russian players.\u201d \n \n In Sicily, he found 10 betting accounts and 12 matches that warranted further investigation. \u201cThe betting patterns on some of these matches are nothing short of remarkable,\u201d Phillips wrote. \u201cThe accounts appeared to know exactly how the games would pan out and backed the winning players at odds so far short of where they should have been that it made the betting markets on the matches completely farcical and obvious to anyone with betting analysis experience that the result was almost certainly a foregone conclusion.\u201d \n \n But the most disturbing group was in north Italy, where Phillips determined that six accounts were responsible for apparently fixing 29 matches. Eight players, most of them Argentine or Spanish, featured heavily on the list of suspicious matches \u2013 including Vassallo Arguello. \u201cThis group of accounts,\u201d Phillips wrote, \u201care a bigger threat to the integrity of the sport than either the Russian or the Sicilian groups.\u201d He added, \u201cThe way these accounts traded on some of these suspect matches, it would strongly suggest that both players in the match are involved in the conspiracy.\u201d \n \n \n \n When they drafted their report for the ATP following the Davydenko\u2013Arguello match, the investigators concluded that a corrupt betting syndicate in Russia \u201cknew \u2026 the outcome of the match in question before its conclusion\u201d and that \u201cit was this knowledge that allowed them to bet with such confidence prior to and during the match and would have allowed them to make a profit of \u00a3354,799 had Betfair not voided all bets.\u201d There was \u201cno doubt\u201d in the investigators\u2019 minds that advance word of Davydenko\u2019s decision to retire injured had been passed to Moscow \u201cfrom one of the players or their support\u201d, but between the player\u2019s refusal to turn over his phone and the threat to Betfair\u2019s employee, the investigators had hit a brick wall. It just wasn\u2019t possible to determine who the guilty party was in relation to this match. \n \n So they concluded that the investigation had \u201cbeen unable to find any evidence to support the possibility of Nikolay Davydenko or Martin Vassallo Arguello being involved in any corrupt practices surrounding their second-round match in Sopot on 2nd August 2007. It is felt that had we had the full support of Betfair account holders and all requested itemised telephone billings then this investigation may well have had a different conclusion.\u201d \n \n But the January after the Sopot match, the International Tennis Federation (ITF), the game\u2019s overarching governing body, had launched a sweeping review of integrity across the whole sport, and that was still underway. \n \n ID: 7783625 \n \n The review was led by Ben Gunn, the former chief constable who had set up the British Horseracing Authority\u2019s integrity unit, and Jeff Rees, a former detective chief superintendent with the Metropolitan police who had gone on to found the International Cricket Council\u2019s anti-corruption department. The Sopot team handed over their evidence of the 72 suspicious matches they had found, and of the gambling networks in Russia and Italy. They knew Gunn well and trusted him to get to grips with it. \n \n \n \n Armed with this evidence, the two detectives flew around the world interviewing players and observing tournaments. They concluded that, though tennis was not \u201cinstitutionally corrupt\u201d, \u201ccheating at tennis for corrupt betting purposes\u201d was the \u201cmost serious threat \u2026 to the core of the integrity of the sport\u201d. In their landmark Environmental Review of Integrity in Professional Tennis, Gunn and Rees identified \u201cspecific concerns\u201d about 45 of the matches that Phillips had highlighted, which they said warranted further investigation. Furthermore, they said, \u201cPatterns of suspected betting activity have been noted on 27 accounts in two different countries.\u201d \n \n There was, the review warned, \u201cno room for complacency\u201d. World tennis must adopt a \u201cco-ordinated and focused Anti-Corruption Programme with an adequately resourced Integrity Unit\u201d. \n \n Prize money at lesser tournaments can be paltry, and a year on the tennis tour can set a player back more than \u00a3100,000, making it tempting to cash in on the occasional fix. ID: 7783679 \n \n Bill Babcock, the ITF\u2019s Grand Slam director who had overseen their investigation, publicly accepted the recommendation, but he put an optimistic spin on it. \u201cThis review is a positive statement,\u201d he declared. \u201cTennis is a healthy sport. There are corruptors around the sport but not inside.\u201d \n \n What the world did not know was that, behind closed doors, a schism had opened up between Gunn and Rees over the proper model for the integrity unit. Gunn proposed including full-scale betting risk analysis capability to monitor the markets and proactively flag suspicious gambling just as Betfair had done on the Sopot match. It would be accompanied by a team of investigators to pursue cases against players once serious suspicions had been raised. Gunn\u2019s model required six high-paid investigators, but Rees countered with a proposal for a much lighter-touch, less costly unit of just three. The Rees proposal would rely on tips from the gambling industry rather than initiating its own analyses or tracing heavily skewed bets back to their source. \n \n The colleagues descended into a major shouting match, insiders say, with Gunn accusing Rees of \u201ctrying to do this with two men and a dog\u201d. They were told to put both their proposals into their final report and allow world tennis to decide which it preferred. \n \n Four months later, in September, Gunn learned that the authorities had opted for Rees\u2019s approach, with half the number of investigators he had proposed, and no one to analyse betting data. Gunn was livid. \u201cThey were trying to do it, in my mind, with one hand tied behind their back,\u201d he told BuzzFeed News and the BBC. \n \n Willerton told BuzzFeed News that the decision not to employ a betting analyst was not a \u201csoft option or a decision based on cost\u201d but was \u201cthe recommendation of a highly qualified investigator\u201d. And he cautioned against overemphasising the value of betting statistics, which he said should be treated as information rather than evidence: \u201cBetting data alone is not sufficient to bring forward a prosecution; it has to be considered, assessed, and verified along with the TIU\u2019s many other sources of intelligence.\u201d \n \n ID: 7783622 \n \n The newly formed Tennis Integrity Unit was unveiled in September 2008, headed by Rees. The same day, the ATP announced that it had found \u201cno evidence of a violation of its rules by either Mr Arguello or Mr Davydenko or anyone else associated with the match\u201d in Sopot. But no mention was made of the other alarming things the investigation had turned up: threats from the Moscow betting ring or the Argentine\u2019s telephone links with Sicilian gamblers betting on other matches. As far as the public was allowed to know, the case was closed. \n \n \n \n The investigators were then invited to hand over their wider evidence in a private meeting with the new unit at an exclusive hotel in London. They gave a PowerPoint presentation, published today by BuzzFeed News and the BBC, setting out their case. \n \n The presentation laid out the text messages Vassallo Arguello had exchanged with suspected fixers and described the \u201cvery suspicious betting\u201d by the Sicilian and Russian accounts. It listed all the matches and players that investigators believed were implicated in corrupt betting worldwide, and recommended that they all face a full disciplinary investigation. \n \n \u201cWe said, \u2018This is what you need,\u2019 and we handed them over around five ring-bound files with all the hard evidence, and we also gave them the electronic evidence as well,\u201d said Phillips. \n \n \u201cFrom my experience of working on dozens of cases for British horseracing, this evidence was very strong. It was really as strong as any evidence we\u2019ve had.\u201d \n \n But Phillips, who now runs a private betting monitoring firm called Global Sports Integrity, recalled that Rees and his men \u201clooked nonplussed\u201d during the presentation and \u201cdidn\u2019t ask questions\u201d. Having gone in with high hopes, he said, \u201cWe finished the presentation and it was \u2018Thank you, there\u2019s the door.\u2019\u201d \n \n BuzzFeed News ID: 7783620 \n \n Still, they continued to hope that the newly formed unit would pursue their evidence. \u201cWe waited and expected to hear that these players were being called into disciplinary hearings,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cEven if they had only done the half-dozen strongest, it would have sent the message that needed to be sent. But they did nothing.\u201d \n \n Shortly after the inception of the unit, a new code was introduced, and every professional player was forced to sign up to its terms. Like the previous anti-corruption rules, it outlawed all forms of fixing and gave investigators the power to compel players to hand over their phone and bank records if they came under suspicion. The burden of proof it adopted in order to merit a ban from the game was low. Investigators just had to establish that an offence had been committed based on the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d \u2013 there was no requirement to prove the allegations beyond reasonable doubt, as a court of law would require. \n \n But in their joint statement to BuzzFeed News, tennis authorities said the new integrity code applied only to future offences. A top US law firm \u201cconfirmed\u201d that they could not apply new rules retrospectively, the statement said. \n \n The ATP\u2019s previous anti-corruption code had also plainly outlawed any \u201cattempt to contrive the outcome or any other aspect of any event\u201d \u2013 but the authorities said they had decided there was not enough evidence to bring any prosecutions under those rules. And they have not opened any new investigations based on the evidence handed over by the Sopot team. \n \n \n \n The upshot was that the 28 players implicated in the 2008 report were never given a second look. Since 2009, the Tennis Integrity Unit has been warned again about nine of them. \n \n The newly formed integrity unit also adopted a policy of withholding all details of its investigations from the public. \u201cWe accept that our confidentiality policy is not popular,\u201d Willerton wrote in his statement to BuzzFeed News, \u201cbut we make no apology for it.\u201d The policy, he said, protects players from \u201cmalicious allegations\u201d, retains the element of surprise, and assures witnesses of confidentiality. But it also leaves the rest of world in the dark, even in cases where players have been punished, about what evidence went before it and on what basis its decisions were made. \n \n The lack of transparency has rankled those who believe the sport is failing to confront a global problem effectively. \u201cIt\u2019s a very secretive unit,\u201d said Ings, the former ATP rules executive who set up its anti-corruption code. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what it\u2019s investigating, and when it does find violations the information that\u2019s disclosed is so minimal that we really can\u2019t get a handle on exactly how it\u2019s operating,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat\u2019s a very disappointing aspect of the Tennis Integrity Unit at the moment.\u201d \n \n Meanwhile, the disbanded Sopot team carried on monitoring the markets and, from time to time, tried to warn the tennis authorities about matches that looked \u201chooky\u201d. \n \n After one such letter, Rees sent a stinging response. \n \n \u201cI have hesitated before writing to you, but I think I need to make you aware that in my view it is only a matter of time before a tennis player brings an action for libel against organisations, individuals, newspapers, those who make wild and irresponsible allegations,\u201d he wrote, adding that he was already aware of the match that had been flagged. \u201cAs the Tennis Integrity Unit is charged with combating corruption in tennis we do, as I have already said, of course welcome any information about apparently suspicious betting patterns which helps us meet our responsibilities. However, as this and many other cases show, it is unwise to rely simply on betting patterns unequivocally to describe a tennis match as \u2018fixed\u2019.\u201d \n \n After that, the investigators stopped trying. \n \n Matt Chase for BuzzFeed News ID: 7783619 \n \n In the years since, other investigators, bookmakers, foreign police, and gambling regulators have continued to warn the unit about some of the same players \u2013 and many more besides. \n \n \n \n BuzzFeed News and the BBC have seen a total of nine lists of suspected fixers handed to the world tennis authorities over the past decade, comprising more than 70 names. Of those, a core of 16 names appear repeatedly \u2013 in several cases as many as seven times. \n \n At least six of the 15 players identified by the BuzzFeed News analysis of 26,000 matches have been flagged to tennis authorities by outside sources. The same analysis shows that the players whom the Sopot investigators first flagged to the Tennis Integrity Unit in 2008 have gone on to lose at least 112 matches where heavily lopsided betting appears to have significantly shifted the odds. \n \n Willerton said the Tennis Integrity Unit did not need to employ a betting expert to perform this kind of analysis, because it got \u201cimmediate real-time access to gambling market intelligence\u201d through cooperative agreements with the betting industry. But he downplayed the importance of this information, which he said was of limited use in prosecuting players. \u201cInformation supplied by betting operators can be an indicator of suspicious activity but is certainly not proof that corruption has taken place,\u201d he said. \n \n \n \n Bookmakers have told BuzzFeed News that, in many cases, when they tried to warn the Tennis Integrity Unit about suspicious matches they got no response. The tennis authorities often did not follow up to request in-depth information \u2013 such as the betting history and computer details of the suspicious gamblers \u2013 to which only bookmakers have access. Without that information, they say, a thorough investigation would be virtually impossible. \n \n The European Sports Security Association, which collects suspicious betting alerts from bookmakers, has sent the Tennis Integrity Unit warnings from its members about suspicious matches involving 15 of the players whose names have repeatedly been flagged to the authorities. In one case, the integrity unit was sent four alerts about a particular player and warned to take note of his \u201crelentless abuse\u201d. \n \n In addition, the European Sports Security Association alerted the Tennis Integrity Unit to 49 suspicious matches in the first three quarters of last year alone and warned in three successive reports that tennis attracts more dubious betting activity than any other sport. \n \n By 2011, Betfair had flagged up at least 20 players who were attracting heavily skewed betting on their matches to the integrity unit \u2013 five of whom had also been in the Sopot files. No disciplinary action was taken against anyone named on the list, and in many cases, sources at Betfair said they heard nothing back from the integrity unit and were not asked to supply further information about the suspicious betting accounts. \n \n \u201cI mean, there were so many guys. And of course, it\u2019s, like, big money in the game,\u201d he said. \u201cFor one stupid match, just losing.\u201d ID: 7783742 \n \n FederBet, a nonprofit sport betting watchdog, said it had flagged more than 20 matches to the tennis authorities in the last quarter of 2015 to no avail. \u201cThe problem of match-fixing in tennis is getting bigger and bigger,\u201d said general director Francesco Baranca. He said bookmakers \u201ctry hard to fight against this because they realise they are losing a lot of money\u201d, but he complained that the tennis authorities are unreceptive. Four other bookmakers also complained that their reports had met with inaction. \n \n Willerton said that the integrity unit assesses \u201call credible information\u201d and that investigations can take years. He added that \u201cit is not the role of betting companies to make judgments about corrupt activity\u201d and gambling sources \u201care simply not qualified to make statements about whether investigations have or have not taken place\u201d. \n \n International police sources, too, share evidence with the Tennis Integrity Unit. In 2013, a former player was prosecuted for corrupt betting on matches. As part of a plea bargain, he handed police a list of 28 players he said were involved in fixing. Six of them had previously been flagged to the tennis authorities by either the Sopot investigators or Betfair. He had placed asterisks against the names of seven players who he said he knew for certain had tanked matches. Officers sent the list to the integrity unit at Wimbledon, but say they heard nothing back. None of the players the fixer said he knew to be involved in corruption have been sanctioned. (One low-ranking player from the wider list was recently disciplined for failing to cooperate with the integrity unit in relation to unspecified offences.) \n \n Last year, Italian police swooped in on two of the players who were flagged to the Tennis Integrity Unit by the Sopot team in 2008. Potito Starace and Daniele Bracciali were accused of match-fixing by judicial authorities in Cremona based on intercepted phone and internet conversations. Bracciali had allegedly discussed fixing a match in Rhode Island with an accountant who was later arrested, while the owner of a betting parlour had allegedly been overheard saying Starace agreed to fix the result of a final in Morocco in 2011. The evidence was passed to the Italian Tennis Federation, which briefly banned both players for life last August before its appeal court decided to clear Starace entirely and reduce Bracciali\u2019s ban to one year in October. The federation did not publicly explain the appeal court\u2019s reasoning. The pair, who deny the allegations, are still facing criminal charges in Italy. The Tennis Integrity Unit has not publicly sanctioned them for fixing. Both men deny the charges. \n \n And a source in the Victoria police, whose sporting integrity unit guards against corruption at the Australian Open, said officers had tried to report concerns about fixing to the unit but had been frustrated by its unwillingness to discuss the problem. \u201cThe TIU need to be more proactive,\u201d the source said. \u201cTennis is one of the easiest sports to corrupt, because there\u2019s only one person up against the other, and because there\u2019s so much money involved,\u201d he went on. \u201cYou\u2019re better off getting it out there and you might suffer a lot of short-term pain, but it\u2019s better to weed out the problem.\u201d \n \n Daniel K\u00f6llerer, 2010 Matthew Stockman / Getty Images ID: 7783736 \n \n World tennis issued its first life ban against a player \u2013 the Austrian Daniel K\u00f6llerer \u2013 in 2011 for taking money to fix matches. No details of the charges against him, which he still denies, were provided. Speaking for the first time about his ban, K\u00f6llerer claimed that authorities were targeting him instead of pursuing stronger evidence against other players. \n \n The Austrian was a deeply unpopular figure \u2013 known as \u201cthe most hated player on the tour\u201d for brawling, spitting at opponents, and ridiculing ball boys. When he was eventually banned for match-fixing, he said that he had been approached three times \u2013 including one time at the French Open \u2013 by gamblers and asked to fix matches for sums ranging from $50,000 to $100,000. But he denied ever accepting the offers and said he had reported the approaches to the authorities. \n \n K\u00f6llerer said that match-fixing was a widespread problem and claimed he knew of other players who were implicated. \u201cThey were losing matches on purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes they were talking, like, in the next locker,\u201d he went on. \u201cI mean, there were so many guys. And of course, it\u2019s, like, big money in the game,\u201d he said. \u201cFor one stupid match, just losing.\u201d \n \n In a statement, the Tennis Integrity Unit said that the approaches K\u00f6llerer reported \u201cproved to be from unidentifiable individuals on social media which could not be validated\u201d and that he did not provide helpful information during his investigation. \n \n The year after K\u00f6llerer\u2019s ban, Rees stepped down from the unit and was replaced by Nigel Willerton, another retired senior detective from the \u201cflying squad\u201d \u2013 Scotland Yard\u2019s armed robberies division. \n \n Davydenko went on to enjoy a glittering career at the top of the game before retiring in November 2014. He reached four Grand Slam semi-finals and beat both Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer to win the ATP World Tour in 2009. When he announced his withdrawal from the game, he said, \u201cUnfortunately, for some years now, I have been struggling with injuries. It\u2019s hard for me to talk about it.\u201d \n \n His lawyer, Frank Immenga, told BuzzFeed News that his client had been cleared of wrongdoing. \u201cNikolay has finally been able to overcome the emotional distress suffered by this unjustified proceeding and does not want to be part of any further speculations,\u201d he said. \u201cTherefore, he will not be giving further answers to questions that he has answered already.\u201d \n \n Vassallo Arguello climbed to 47th in the world rankings in 2009 before his career began to tail off. He has never officially announced his retirement, but his last professional game was in 2011. He now works as a coach in Argentina.

Three of these matches were at Wimbledon. \n \n In a confidential report for the tennis authorities in 2008, the enquiry team said 28 players involved in these matches should be investigated, but the findings were never followed up. \n \n Tennis introduced a new anti-corruption code in 2009 but after taking legal advice were told previous corruption offences could not be pursued. \n \n \"As a result, no new investigations into any of the players who were mentioned in the 2008 report were opened,\" a TIU spokesman said. \n \n In subsequent years, there were repeated alerts sent to the TIU about a third of these players. None of them was disciplined by the TIU. \n \n A group of whistle blowers inside tennis, who want to remain anonymous, recently passed the documents on to the BBC and Buzzfeed News. \n \n We contacted Mark Phillips, one of the betting investigators in the 2007 enquiry, who told the BBC that they discovered repeated suspicious betting activity about a clear group. \n \n \"There was a core of about 10 players who we believed were the most common perpetrators that were at the root of the problem,\" he said. \n \n He has never spoken publicly about the material he gathered, which he said was as powerful as any he had seen in over 20 years as a betting investigator. \n \n \"The evidence was really strong,\" he added. \"There appeared to be a really good chance to nip it in the bud and get a strong deterrent out there to root out the main bad apples.\" \n \n Media playback is not supported on this device Mark Phillips is a betting analyst who worked on an investigation into suspicious gambling in tennis \n \n The BBC and Buzzfeed were also passed the names of other current players the TIU have repeatedly been warned about by betting organisations, sports integrity units and professional gamblers. \n \n Many of these players have been on the radar of the tennis authorities for involvement in suspicious matches going back to 2003. \n \n The BBC and Buzzfeed News have decided not to name the players because, without access to their phone, bank and computer records, it is not possible to determine whether they may have been personally taking part in match fixing. \n \n However, tennis' integrity unit does have the power to demand all this evidence from any professional tennis player. \n \n \"There is an element of actually keeping things under wraps,\" said Benn Gunn, a former police chief constable who conducted a major review of betting in tennis that led to the creation of the Tennis Integrity Unit. \n \n It's the first time he has publicly spoken about his concerns. \n \n Media playback is not supported on this device In 2011, Daniel Koellerer was banned for life from professional tennis over alleged match-fixing but denied the claims. \n \n \"If they were really serious about dealing with this, then they really need to create an integrity unit with teeth,\" he said. \n \n The European Sports Security Association, which monitors betting for leading bookmakers, flagged up more than 50 suspicious matches to the TIU in 2015. \n \n The organisation declared that tennis attracts more suspicious gambling activity than other sport. \n \n While he welcomed the support of the betting industry, Nigel Willerton, director of the TIU, said \"it is not the role of betting companies to make judgements about corrupt activity\". \n \n He added: \"All credible information received by the TIU is analysed, assessed, and investigated by highly experienced former law-enforcement investigators.\" \n \n The problem of suspicious betting and match-fixing is not going away. \n \n Eight of the players repeatedly flagged to the TIU over the past decade are due to play in the Australian Open which starts on Monday 18 January. \n \n Analysis \n \n BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller: \n \n \"The TIU has a full-time staff of just five and relies on intelligence from players and betting companies to alert them to potential corruption. They have a presence at between 20 and 30 tournaments a year, and their investigations over the past two years have resulted in seven players and one official being banned for between six months and a lifetime. \n \n \"Only one of those players has ever reached the top 200, and there are clearly temptations for lower-ranked professionals. Players outside the top 200 are unlikely to earn much more than \u00a340,000 in prize money each year, and that is before coaching, travel and hotel expenses are taken into account. \n \n \"It is highly debatable whether enough resources are directed towards the TIU, and another potential flaw is that representatives from the sport's four governing bodies decide whether the evidence gathered is strong enough to be presented to an independent hearing. Professional Tennis Integrity Officers from the ITF, ATP, WTA and the Grand Slams make that call, and as a result the process is not as transparent as it should be.\"",

    "document": "Updated | Older fathers appear to have geekier sons, scientists have discovered. In a study of over 30,000 twins, researchers found boys who had older fathers scored higher on the \u201cgeek index\u201d\u2014and that the older the father, the higher the score. (The geek effect was only seen in boys.) \n \n By the age of 12, boys with older fathers were found to be more intelligent, more focused on their interests and were less concerned about whether or not they fitted in with their peers. \n \n While there has been much research showing the negative impact having children later in life can have\u2014including increased risk of autism and schizophrenia\u2014little has been done into the potential benefits. \n \n The latest study, published in the journal Translational Psychiatry on Tuesday, indicates there are evolutionary advantages for men having children later in life. \n \n Scientists from the U.K and the U.S. collected cognitive and behavioral data on 15,000 sets of twins. At the age of 12, they completed tests measuring their \u201cgeeky\u201d traits, including their non-verbal IQ, their focus on subjects of interest and their social aloofness. Parents were asked how they were perceived by their peers and if they had interests that dominated their time. \n \n From this, the researchers were able to produce a \u201cgeek index score\u201d for each child in the study and to compare it to the age of the parents. \n \n Their findings showed a correlation between the age of the father and the geekiness of the sons, with a positive correlation between the two\u2014the older the father, the geekier the son. They also noticed geek traits appeared more after the age of 45. \n \n Geeky boys did better in school exams, especially STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) subjects, suggesting they would be more successful in their careers as adults. \n \n The authors say there are several limitations to the study. They were not able to determine whether the geek effect extended beyond secondary education and future success, adding it \u201cremains possible that personality traits associated with GI [geek index] cease to be advantageous in later life.\u201d For example, being flexible and socially aware rather than focusing on a single goal may provide more benefits in the work environment in the long-term. \n \n They also said they could not verify whether geek traits were associated with things like poor emotional and social functioning. \n \n However, they said the findings show there may be some benefits associated with having an older father. \n \n Study author Magdalena Janecka tells Newsweek: \u201cOur primary hypothesis is that higher levels of those \u2018geeky\u2019 traits in offspring of older men are mainly due is due to characteristics of the fathers themselves. Men who decide to delay fatherhood often do so due to their extended career and educational pursuits, and likely themselves display higher levels of \u2018geekiness.\u2019\u201d \n \n Another implication of the study is the link between autism and higher paternal age. The scientists were not able to measure the link directly, but say that some of the genes relating to geekiness and autism overlap, and that these genes may be more prevalent in older fathers. \n \n If a child is only born with some of these genes, it may help them succeed in school, but if they get a \u201chigher dose,\u201d they may be more at risk of autism. \n \n This link could also explain why the geek effect was only seen in boys. \u201cWe think the reasons for this may be similar to those why females seem protected from autism in general,\u201d Janecka says. \u201cFor some reason, there could be a selective passage of those traits from fathers to son, but biologically, we still do not know how this could work.\u201d \n \n She also says girls with older fathers may well be geeky too, just in different ways: \u201cAnother possibility is that we have not measured \u2018geekiness\u2019 in a way that allows to capture its manifestation in females\u2014there remains a caveat that daughters of older men are just as geeky, but we could not capture it in the current study.\u201d \n \n The study, Janecka adds, does not mean men should put off having children until they are older in the hope of having more intelligent sons. \u201cThose findings should definitely not be taken to guide individual decisions about parenthood,\u201d she says. \u201cEffects we are describing are visible in large samples, but may operate very differently in cases of individual families.\u201d \n \n Patrik Magnusson, from the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, has studied the link between parental age and autism risk. Commenting on the study, he tells Newsweek: \u201cThat geekiness is associated with school success is not strange at all, to be a geek is defined as being someone with skills that are very well suited for school. That geekiness is associated with having an old father is a little stranger.\u201d \n \n He says this link is likely down to several different factors, including geekiness being heritable. Another could be that men who get the chance to become fathers at a later age need to show \u201cspecial positive skills.\u201d \n \n \u201cThis special skill may be genetic and transmitted to the offspring,\u201d he says. \u201cAlso, fathers that wait with kids may predominantly be fathers that have spent time studying or spent time developing ideas or business in favour of a the more common family life. Such personality is likely genetically inherited.\u201d \n \n This story has been updated to include comments from Patrik Magnusson. ||||| Older men tend to have \u201cgeekier\u201d sons who are more aloof, have higher IQs and a more intense focus on their interests than those born to younger fathers, researchers claim. \n \n The finding, which emerged from a study of nearly 8,000 British twins, suggests that having an older father may benefit children and boost their performance in technical subjects at secondary school. \n \n \n \n Researchers in the UK and the US analysed questionnaires from 7,781 British twins and scored them according to their non-verbal IQ at 12 years old, as well as parental reports on how focused and socially aloof they were. The scientists then combined these scores into an overall \u201cgeek index\u201d. \n \n \n \n Magdalena Janecka at King\u2019s College London said the project came about after she and her colleagues had brainstormed what traits and skills helped people to succeed in the modern age. \u201cIf you look at who does well in life right now, it\u2019s geeks,\u201d she said. \n \n \n \n Drawing on the twins\u2019 records, the scientists found that children born to older fathers tended to score slightly higher on the geek index. For a father aged 25 or younger, the average score of the children was 39.6. That figure rose to 41 in children with fathers aged 35 to 44, and to 47 for those with fathers aged over 50. \n \n \n \n The effect was strongest in boys, where the geek index rose by about 1.5 points for every extra five years of paternal age. The age of the children\u2019s mothers seemed to have almost no effect on the geek index. \n \n \n \n When the scientists looked at the children\u2019s achievements at school they found that having a high IQ, a tendency to focus intensely and social aloofness were all linked to children taking more technical GCSEs. When children displayed all three traits, the effect was even more pronounced, the researchers write in the journal Translational Psychiatry. Overall, children who were born when their fathers were 50 or older were 32% more likely to achieve two A or A* grades at GCSE than children born to men aged under 25. \n \n Janecka said the study is one of the first to suggest that having an older father can have benefits for a child. Previous work by Janecka and others has found that children born to older men are more at risk of medical conditions including autism and schizophrenia. \n \n \n \n The scientists calculate that 57% of the geek index score is inherited, but that figure is likely to vary with age. If right, it suggests that DNA and the environment have roughly an equal share in how geeky someone turns out. Writing in the journal, the researchers speculate that there may be some overlap with genes that contribute to autism and a high score on their index. \n \n \n \n The effect that a father\u2019s age had on their child\u2019s geek index remained when the researchers took into account the men\u2019s qualifications, their job and socioeconomic status. \u201cWe have known for a while about the negative consequences of advanced paternal age, but now we have shown that these children may also go on to have better educational and career prospects,\u201d Janecka said. She added that some of the genes that contribute to geekiness and academic success might also lead to a higher risk of autism when a child inherits more of them. \u201cWith a higher \u2018dose\u2019 of these genes, and when there are other contributing risk factors, they may end up with a higher predisposition to autism.\u201d \n \n The findings do not, however, make an unshakeable argument for delaying fatherhood. Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg rank among the greatest geeks in the world but both of their fathers were about 30 when they had their sons. \n \n If the findings are right, it is unclear why the effect is much stronger for boys than girls. Janecka said that the study may simply have failed to capture how girls display geekiness. \u201cMaybe we aren\u2019t measuring geekiness properly. They may be geeky in a different way to boys,\u201d she said. But it is also possible that whatever averts autism in girls \u2013 five times as many males are diagnosed than females \u2013 also shields them from the most geeky traits. \n \n Research is under way to recognise why older parents are more likely to have children with particular mental disorders. One theory pinpoints mutations that build up in parents\u2019 sperm and eggs. But with geekiness, the answer could lie in geekier men simply being more likely to delay fatherhood. \n \n \u201cCertain men who delay fatherhood tend to be better educated and have better jobs and a higher geek index and they pass those genetics nto their offspring,\u201d said Janecka. \u201cIt causes them to delay fatherhood, but other factors might contribute too.\u201d ||||| Citation: Translational Psychiatry (2017) 7, e1156; doi:10.1038/tp.2017.125 \n \n Published online 20 June 2017 \n \n M Janecka1,2, F Rijsdijk1, D Rai3, A Modabbernia2 and A Reichenberg2,4 \n \n Advanced paternal age (APA) at conception has been associated with negative outcomes in offspring, raising concerns about increasing age at fatherhood. Evidence from evolutionary and psychological research, however, suggests possible link between APA and a phenotypic advantage. We defined such advantage as educational success, which is positively associated with future socioeconomic status. We hypothesised that high IQ, strong focus on the subject of interest and little concern about \u2018fitting in\u2019 will be associated with such success. Although these traits are continuously distributed in the population, they cluster together in so-called \u2018geeks\u2019. We used these measures to compute a \u2018geek index\u2019 (GI), and showed it to be strongly predictive of future academic attainment, beyond the independent contribution of the individual traits. GI was associated with paternal age in male offspring only, and mediated the positive effects of APA on education outcomes, in a similar sexually dimorphic manner. The association between paternal age and GI was partly mediated by genetic factors not correlated with age at fatherhood, suggesting contribution of de novo factors to the \u2018geeky\u2019 phenotype. Our study sheds new light on the multifaceted nature of the APA effects and explores the intricate links between APA, autism and talent. \n \n Top of page Introduction Advanced paternal age (APA) at conception has been associated with a number of adverse neuropsychiatric outcomes in offspring, particularly autism spectrum disorders1, 2 and schizophrenia.3, 4 Although well replicated, it is plausible that these observations reflect only one side of the nature of the APA effects. Given that historically, conceiving a child later in life was indicative of biological fitness,5 there could also exist a link between APA and a phenotypic advantage. In an environment characterised by high mortality, only the fittest males would survive and be able to reproduce when old,6 passing their advantageous traits onto offspring. Alternatively, more recent indices of \u2018fitness\u2019\u2014including extended educational and career pursuits\u2014could themselves correlate with an older age at fatherhood. Either of these selection mechanisms could help offset negative effects of de novo genetic mutations that accumulate in paternal sperm with age.7 Despite broad evidence concerning negative consequences of early parenthood, the potential advantage of APA has received very little attention. Very young parents tend to be characterised by lower education and economic disadvantage,8 and their offspring were shown to be at increased risk for educational underachievement, crime, substance abuse and health problems.9 Although the effects of early reproduction are likely qualitatively different from those of APA,10 it may seem surprising that the possibility of protective effects of delayed parenthood has thus far received so little attention. Here we investigated whether having an older father is associated with certain beneficial traits. We defined such advantageous phenotype based on considerations of what could be \u2018adaptive\u2019 in the modern environment. We hypothesised that high IQ; ability to retain strong focus on the subject of interest; and some degree of social aloofness are likely to be particularly beneficial in the knowledge-driven economy. Although these traits are continuously distributed in the population, ethnographic literature groups them under an umbrella-term \u2018geek\u2019 (\u2018intelligent outcast\u2019; \u2018labelled because of their expertise and lack of social skills\u2019; \u2018socially awkward and overly intellectual (\u2026) prone to obsessive interests\u201911, 12, 13). Therefore, we labelled our composite measure of non-verbal intelligence, restrictive interests and reduced need to fit in with the peer group as \u2018geek index\u2019 (GI). We validated our measure of GI by verifying its scope to predict future academic achievement. Although the GI components were all independently associated with school results, we show they are most beneficial when co-occurring in the \u2018geek\u2019 cluster. Finally, we tested the hypothesis that advancing paternal age is associated with higher GI in offspring. Using data from the Twin Early Development Study (TEDS), a British, population-representative study of twins, allowed us to further examine sex differences, as well as genetic and environmental contributions to this index. \n \n Top of page Materials and methods Sample The study used the TEDS sample, a large nationally representative cohort of British twins.14 There were 12 468 twins from 6234 families assessed at the age of 12, with data on relevant questionnaires available for 8601 (4528 families; questionnaire details below). Out of these, 7781 (4097 families) individuals had complete data on all covariates. This subset of individuals had higher mean maternal and paternal ages than those recorded in the full sample (<1 year difference for both), lower CAST scores (6% difference), higher Raven\u2019s Matrices test results (1% difference) and higher academic achievement at age 16 (4% difference; Supplementary Table S1). All sample descriptives are presented in Supplementary Table S1. Measures GI was computed using child\u2019s scores of (i) non-verbal intelligence, (ii) restrictive and repetitive behaviours (RRBs) and (iii) social aloofness. Scores on the Raven\u2019s Standard Progressive Matrices15 test were used to obtain (i). Childhood Autism Spectrum Test16 (CAST) scores were used to obtain both (ii) and (iii). CAST measures came from parental reports (see Supplementary Table S2 for the list of items), and the cognitive tests were completed by the TEDS participants via web platforms; all assessments took place at the age of 12. Covariates in the adjusted models included socioeconomic status (SES; index of parent qualifications and employment, and mother\u2019s age at birth of first child), maternal age at conception, sex and zygosity. Education achievement was measured using the results of nationally standardised exams taken in the United Kingdom typically at the age of 16 in a wide range of subjects (General Certificate of Secondary Education, GCSE). The curriculum and awarding of GCSEs is overseen by examination boards regulated by the British government, ensuring consistent standards across the country and throughout the time. All pupils are required to sit exams in English Language and Literature, Mathematics and Science, but are otherwise free to choose among a number of other subjects. Science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects refer to the part of the school curriculum that focuses on development of the knowledge and skills essential for a number of science and technology-related careers. As such, they have been the focus of the educational policies in both United Kingdom and United States.17, 18, 19 High attainment in the STEM subjects have been consistently shown to predict future income over and above overall school performance, with STEM degree majors earning on average more than $15 000 per year than non-STEM degree majors in full-time jobs.20, 21 Geek index GI scores were computed by multiplying the non-verbal cognitive scores with the sum of the CAST social and RRBs items (after weighing down high RRB scores\u2014see below). In order to avoid the confusion between GI and autism symptoms, and to ensure that our construct represents an advantageous trait, we recoded very high RRB scores (Supplementary Table S3), so that the highest GI scores were associated with midrange RRB values. In addition, all scales contributing to GI were linearly transformed, so that 1 represented a true score of 0, 2 a score of 1 and so on. This was done to avoid obtaining GI=0 for all individuals scoring 0 on at least one of the GI subscales, as a result of multiplication by 0. Finally, to ensure that our results did not arise due to unequal contribution of measures used to compute GI, or transformation of the RRB score described above, all analyses were also done using (i) standardised subscales and (ii) non-transformed RRB scores. Statistical analysis All analyses were conducted using R22 (version 3.2.2) and OpenMX.23 Validation of the GI To establish whether GI can predict future academic attainment, we looked at the association between GI and school results at the age of 16. The measure of academic performance reflected a product of grade score and qualification value, in approximate number of GCSE equivalents (A levels completed at this age were assumed to be double the workload of GCSEs). This enabled us to obtain an index of school attainment for all individuals regardless of the qualification taken. Given the evidence that attainment in STEM subjects is a stronger predictor of future income than attainment in Art subjects, we also investigated the association between GI and (i) number of STEM GCSEs taken, (ii) mean grades at STEM GCSEs and (iii) probability of obtaining A or A* in at least two STEM GCSEs. The effect of GI on academic performance was tested using linear and logistic mixed models fitted by maximum-likelihood procedure, with a random effect of family ID around the intercept (lme4 package), and controlling for the effects of SES, sex, zygosity and maternal age. We also verified whether the cognitive and behavioural traits used to derive the GI were associated with choosing more STEM GCSEs when clustering together, rather than existing independently of each other. We defined high/low levels of the GI subscales as \u00b11 s.d. from the mean, and looked at mean number of STEM GCSEs in \u2018geeks\u2019 (high IQ, socially aloof, high RRBs), compared to individuals with (i) high IQ, not socially aloof and low RRBs score and (ii) low IQ, socially aloof and high RRBs score. To investigate how specific this effect was, we performed similar analyses for GCSEs in Art subjects. Finally, we used structural equation modelling (lavaan package) to verify whether a latent construct underlain by RRBs score, non-verbal IQ and social aloofness are associated with school results at age 16. Association between paternal age and GI The association between paternal age (treated as a continuous variable) and GI was investigated using mixed models, in line with the procedures described above. Both linear and quadratic models were investigated, and a log-likelihood ratio test was used to evaluate whether adding quadratic component significantly improved the fit of the model. To validate that the association between paternal age and GI is stronger than that between paternal age and the GI subscales, we compared the size and significance level of paternal age effects on the standardised GI subscales. Given the evidence for the sexually dimorphic nature of the paternal age effects,1, 24 we tested whether the link between GI and paternal age differs between males and females. Furthermore, to ensure that our results did not arise due to either very limited number of offspring of fathers in the highest paternal age categories (paternal age >51) or enrichment of autism cases among the offspring of older men, all analyses were also conducted in (i) a subset of children with fathers aged 50 or younger at conception, and (ii) after excluding individuals with a confirmed autism diagnosis. Mediation between paternal age and education outcomes We tested the association between association paternal age and conception, applying mixed models methodology, as specified above. Next, we investigated whether this association is mediated by the effects of paternal age on GI. In line with the other procedures, this was done using a multilevel framework (mediation package), thus controlling for the family structure in our data. Paternal age was specified as a predictor, GI as a mediator and exam results as the outcome, with the covariates including SES, maternal age, zygosity and\u2014where appropriate\u2014sex. For each model, we run 100 simulation and used a bootstrap procedure to estimate 95% Quasi\u2013Bayesian confidence intervals of the effect size estimates. Testing our hypothesis of sexually dimorphic effects of APA, we run the mediation analysis separately for male and female offspring. Effects of paternal age on heritability of GI We derived tetrachoric correlations for GI in mono- (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins in OpenMx, using raw data full information maximum-likelihood estimation. Given the high MZ correlation (which was more than twice the DZ correlations and suggestive of dominance effects), we ran both ADE and AE univariate twin models to obtain the standardised genetic and environmental variance components for the trait. For more details on these models see Rijsdijk and Sham,25 and Neale and Maes.26 Subsequently, we ran a basic GxE model27 on GI with paternal age as moderator. This allowed us to partition the genetic and environmental effects on GI into those that are moderated and those that are independent of paternal age. As the moderating effects on the variance components in this model could be biased by a (genetic) correlation between moderator and GI, paternal age effects were regressed out of the GI scores prior to fitting the GxE model. This model allowed us to get an insight into the mechanisms behind the association between paternal age and GI\u2014due to perfect correlation of paternal age in MZ and DZ twins, it would not be possible to formally test the genetic and environmental contributions to this association otherwise. \n \n Top of page Discussion In summary, male offspring of older fathers had higher \u2018geek index\u2019 scores, a composite measure of high IQ, strong focus on the subject of interest and social aloofness. To our knowledge, this is the first time that APA was shown to associate with an advantageous outcome. GI was positively linked with future academic attainment\u2014including the key predictors of future SES\u2014suggesting a phenotypic advantage in the offspring of older fathers. Using a population-based longitudinal twin sample protects against bias and enhances generalisability, while controlling for the key covariates\u2014including maternal age, SES and sex\u2014and adjusting for the family structure mitigates against inflation in the reported effects. Molecular underpinnings of the effects of APA on GI Our study offered new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the APA effects on offspring. We showed that GI was 57% heritable, highlighting the importance of the genetic factors in educational success.29 Both familial, additive genetic effects and de novo mutations\u2014including those accumulating in paternal sperm with age\u2014likely contributed to this measure of heritability. We acknowledge that \u2018geekiness\u2019 likely runs in families, and correlates with paternal age at conception\u2014and therefore, the association observed in our study is underlain largely by familial factors. Nevertheless, our results suggest that genetic influences on GI may extend beyond those. First, all associations between paternal age an GI in males remained significant after controlling for SES, which\u2014indexing parental education and employment status\u2014likely correlates with parental GI. Second, using a GxE model we showed that the genetic, but not environmental, contribution to GI variance increases with paternal age. In other words, genes were becoming more important in determining the GI as paternal age increased. Controlling for the genetic correlation between GI and paternal age limited the chance that the observed association arose solely due to the genetic make-up of men who decide to delay fatherhood, therefore suggesting potential contribution of de novo genetic factors. Such multifactorial nature of the APA effects\u2014with relatively minor contribution of de novo effects\u2014is in line with the results from recent population genetics model,30 and represents a consensus between multiple lines of evidence from molecular and epidemiological research.7, 31, 32, 33 Although these studies focused largely on the mechanisms of association between APA and neurodevelopmental disorders, as we explain below, they can provide useful insights in unravelling the factors underlying the link between paternal age and GI. \u2018Geekiness\u2019, autism and talent It is possible that the factors mediating the association between advanced paternal age and GI are overlapping with those between advanced paternal age and autism.1, 32, 34, 35 Although autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that is qualitatively different from being a \u2018geek\u2019, it is possible that some of its facets are captured by the index measured in the current study. Indeed, original descriptions of autistic disorders by Kanner (1943) and Asperger (1944) involved a notion that the associated personality characteristics are relevant for development of high-level skills (\u2018astounding vocabulary of the speaking children, the excellent memory for events of several years before, the phenomenal rote memory for poems and names, and the precise recollection of complex patterns and sequences, bespeak good intelligence\u2019 (Kanner, 194336); \u2018the problems are compensated by a high level of original thought and experience. This can often lead to exception achievements later in life\u2019 (Asperger, 1944, translated by Uta Frith37). Several studies point towards high prevalence of individuals with the broad autism phenotype in certain professional groups, including academics, engineers and musicians.38, 39, 40, 41, 42 Furthermore, superior performance on non-verbal cognitive tasks in individuals on the autism spectrum versus controls has been shown before,43 and common genetic variants for autism were predictive of higher IQ in the general population.44 We showed that GI was positively associated with educational attainment, including the measures particularly predictive of future SES, and fully mediated the positive association between paternal age and school results. Although we could mitigate against the results being biased by the inclusion of individuals with a diagnosis of autism, it is likely that the effects of APA on autism symptomatology in offspring are continuously distributed in the general population,2, 45 contributing to the patterns reported in the current study. If advanced paternal is associated with familial and de novo molecular events that contribute to autism, it could also contribute to the \u2018cognitive strengths\u2019 associated with the liability to this disorder\u2014and our results capture some of this signal. Of particular interest here is the recent evidence suggesting that familial risk for autism can be partitioned into several components, including a cluster of variants contributing to high IQ.46 Although our focus here remained on the beneficial effects of APA, we must emphasise they are likely to be specific to the modern knowledge-based environment, without necessarily having such advantageous effects historically. In other words, offspring of older fathers are not inherently biologically \u2018fit\u2019; rather, the cluster of behavioural and cognitive traits, which we showed they are enriched for, conveys an advantage in modern times. This is supported by a recent study investigating offspring fitness in relation to paternal age in historical and current cohorts, with a total sample size of over 1.3 million and data spanning four centuries.47 Although APA was strongly associated with increased infant mortality in pre-industrial populations, this relationship was reversed in the 20th-century Sweden, suggesting relative recency of the phenomenon of APA-related advantage. Sexual dimorphism of the effects of APA and the \u2018geek index\u2019 The notion that APA mediated geekiness and autism via partly overlapping pathways fits in with our observations of sexually dimorphic effects of APA on GI. Previous studies consistently reported higher rates of autism in males versus females,48, 49 with suggestions of a female protective factor contributing to this gender imbalance.50 Such protective effects have yet to be characterised, with mechanisms proposed to date including X chromosome-mediated effects,51 role of hormones,52, 53 differential gene expression54 and social factors.55 Nevertheless, how these mechanisms could interact with the familial and de novo genetic factors for autism/GI discussed above remains to be elucidated. The notion of sexually dimorphic effects of APA on offspring has received some attention before, however, the evidence emerging from the research to date remains inconclusive. The majority of studies reporting sex differences in the APA effects suggested higher risk for APA-related disorders in female than in male offspring, with up to three-fold increase in risk in girls compared to boys.1, 56, 57 However, neither the meta-analysis of APA-schizophrenia studies by Miller et al.,57 nor multi-cohort autism study by Sandin et al.58 confirmed the presence of such differences. Comparison with previous findings At first, our findings seem to be at odds with previous research suggesting an association between APA and lower cognitive skills. However, the results to date have been mixed, with some studies reporting lack of APA effects on IQ,59 and others a decrease in cognitive performance in the offspring of aged fathers.50, 51 In the largest study reporting effects of paternal age on educational attainment, D\u2019Onofrio et al.34 showed that higher paternal age was associated with better school performance (D\u2019Onofrio appendix) in population-based analyses. In our study, advanced paternal age was associated with higher scores on the Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrices test (data not shown), therefore the lack of agreement between our findings and the literature cannot be attributed to compounding the non-verbal IQ with other measures. Discrepancies in research could be explained by different ages of the populations studied, differences in definitions of both the outcome measure and the covariates (particularly SES), and analytical methods. It is worth noting that results regarding maternal age contribution to offspring cognitive outcomes are similarly inconclusive, with literature providing the evidence for either direction of its effects.60, 61 Strengths and limitations Our novel hypothesis, analytical methods and use of a large, population-representative sample of twins, are the main strengths of our study. Controlling for SES and maternal age, we could ensure that our results did not arise solely due to higher levels of education, better financial status in men who conceive later in life or maternal factors. Furthermore, using a mixed-model approach allowed us to leverage the unique twins data set without the risk of inflating results. Finally, we verified that our findings were not driven by outliers in the sample, and remained significant after excluding individuals of very old fathers (>50 years) or those with a diagnosis of autism. The study has, however, several limitations. It was not possible to determine whether the advantageous effects of GI extend beyond secondary education, and correlate with future SES. It remains possible that personality traits associated with GI cease to be advantageous later in life. In career settings, cognitive flexibility and ability to tune in to subtle social cues may convey more benefits than strong focus and pursuing one\u2019s goal irrespective of others\u2019 opinion. Although we could show that GI was strongly associated with measures of educational attainment in STEM subjects, which has been previously shown to strongly predict future income, we could not test these effects directly because cohort members are young. We also could not verify whether high GI is associated with any adverse outcomes, for example, worse socioemotional functioning, and we acknowledge that the \u2018geek\u2019 phenotype has yet to be fully characterised. Finally, we could not control for paternal age at birth of his first child. Although this would be a useful predictor of the socioeconomic index composite and would help verify the GI in offspring of men who delay versus those who extend fatherhood, relevant data had not been collected. \n \n Top of page Conclusions Results of our study indicate that APA is associated with some phenotypic advantage in male offspring. A cluster of behavioural and cognitive traits identified as characteristic of \u2018geeks\u2019 was strongly predictive of academic, and thus likely also career success. We could show that paternal age is more strongly associated with such combination of traits than any of these traits alone, suggesting a special relationship between APA and educational attainment. Such an association is likely to be mediated by factors similar to those linking APA and autism. Our results provide original insights into the possibility of phenotypic advantage associated with delayed fatherhood. \n \n Top of page Conflict of interest The authors declare no conflict of interest. \n \n Top of page References Reichenberg A, Gross R, Weiser M, Bresnahan M, Silverman J, Harlap S et al.

Or it could be down to differences in the way the brains of the boys and girls developed. \n \n Prof Allan Pacey, from the University of Sheffield, said: \"Whilst it may be chic to be a geek, I would not recommend that would-be parents delay their plans to start a family to specifically increase the odds of having a child with geek-like qualities. \n \n \"The dangers of older parenting are well described, such as an increased risk of infertility, miscarriage, or conceiving a child with a variety of debilitating disorders. \n \n \"However, I do find the idea of a 'geek gene' quite intriguing, and, given our recent trend to have our children later in life, perhaps we are destined for future society of geniuses that are going to help us solve all the world's problems.\" \n \n The research team also believe some genetic traits being inherited from older fathers could be affecting both geekiness and autism. \n \n Dr Janecka said: \"When the child is born only with some of those genes, they may be more likely to succeed in school. \n \n \"However, with a higher 'dose' of these genes, and when there are other contributing risk factors, they may end up with a higher predisposition for autism.\" \n \n Follow James on Twitter.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A new study suggests an upside for boys who have older dads: higher IQs. More specifically, they tend to score higher on what the researchers call the \"geek index,\" reports the Guardian. And this is clearly seen as a positive: \"If you look at who does well in life right now, it\u2019s geeks,\" says Magdalena Janecka at King\u2019s College London. The geek index, she explains, is determined by such factors as ability to focus, non-verbal IQ scores taken at age 12, and social aloofness. The latter trait may sound like a negative, but the BBC frames it as the boys not being overly concerned with fitting in. A mother's age appears to have no impact. The team studied more than 7,000 sets of twins in the UK. The average geek score for boys born to dads 25 or younger is 39. It goes up to 41 when dads had the child between 35 and 44, and jumps to 47 when dads were 50 or older. The impact was less pronounced on girls, and more pronounced when measuring science, tech, engineering, and math scores. Kids born to fathers 50 or older were 32% more likely to earn at least two A's on standardized tests than children born to men aged under 25, the researchers report in Translational Psychiatry. They calculate that 57% of the geek index score is inherited, with possible overlap between genes that contribute to a high geek score and to autism. \u201cOur primary hypothesis is that higher levels of those \u2018geeky\u2019 traits in offspring of older men are mainly due is due to characteristics of the fathers themselves,\" Janecka tells Newsweek. \"Men who decide to delay fatherhood often do so due to their extended career and educational pursuits, and likely themselves display higher levels of \u2018geekiness.\u2019\u201d (Younger fathers are also likelier to die younger.)",

Geeky boys did better in school exams, especially STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) subjects. Scientists were not able to determine whether the geek effect extended beyond secondary education and future success, adding it \u201cremains possible that personality traits associated with GI [geek index] cease to be advantageous in later life\u201d",

    "document": "Trigger warning: child loss \n \n We were never supposed to leave our beach vacation early to plan a funeral for our 3-year-old son. And, yet, within the course of one week, we had driven to the beach, returned without him, and held his funeral. \n \n Do you know that drowning is the leading cause of death in children ages 1-4 and the second leading cause in ages 1-14? Do you know that 69% of children who drown are not expected to be swimming, yet they are found in water? Do you know that a child can drown in less than one minute? \n \n Unfortunately, I know these facts all too well. On June 10, 2018, my three year old son, Levi, drowned while on vacation in Fort Morgan, AL. \n \n There is a misconception that drowning only happens when you are swimming. But, drowning also happens when you are 200 feet away from a pool, upstairs, eating Cheetos, wearing your neon yellow crab-hunting shirt, when you leave your mom\u2019s side, even though you are usually Velcro-ed to her. Drowning isn\u2019t splashing and yelling. It is silent, and it takes SECONDS. \n \n I have always taken water safety seriously. In each of the pictures I have of my son\u2019s final day, he is wearing a life jacket. Flying a kite with his dad? Life jacket. Eating M&M\u2019s in a beach chair? Life jacket. \n \n How could I have known that every parent\u2019s worst nightmare would be my reality? It happened so quickly. I don\u2019t know how Levi got away from us as we were cleaning up from dinner, or what lured him to go outside alone. I was the one who found him, face down, in the deep end. Just moments before this horrific discovery, I split a brownie with him. I still had the other half of the brownie in my mouth when I jumped into the pool to grab my son. Mere moments, seconds. \n \n We had six physicians on our trip, including my own husband. If Levi could have been saved by desperation, skill, and love, he would still be here. Yet, how did I not fully realize just how quickly a child can drown? They initiated CPR immediately, even intubated him before the ambulance arrived. But Levi could not be saved, even with this immediate response. \n \n In the days after we lost Levi, when we were forced to stumble forward without our baby boy, I started researching. I am (was?) on my third journey of parenting a child in the 1-4 age group. Why did I not know that drowning is the leading cause of death? Of course, I knew drowning was a potential danger. We utilized life jackets, swim lessons, supervision while swimming. But why did I not know about the dangers of drowning during NON-SWIMMING times? How did I not know it took less than one minute? \n \n Why is my mom-brain filled with internal debates about screen time, organic fruit, and sunscreen free of oxybenzone? I still cut my 9-year-old\u2019s grapes. I buy DHA milk. I worry that the hours of YouTube my kids watch will prevent them from being functioning adults one day. These are the topics that are pushed in my direction, the worries that I have grasped onto as I navigate parenting. Well, the unfortunate irony here is that I had taken the iPhone away from my son not too long before he slipped away from us. I sure wish I had cared a little less about screen time that night. \n \n The more I researched, the angrier I became. Oh, and I had to search. Why are discussions about drowning almost an afterthought? Background noise? This is a LEADING cause of death, and it is 100% PREVENTABLE. Yes, there are news stories, but we have become numb to these \u201cdon\u2019t forget to watch your kids while swimming\u201d factual articles that are regurgitated each year and the faded \u201cno lifeguard on duty\u201d signs stuck on a wall by a pool. \n \n The harsh reality is that Levi\u2019s death rests on me. These are the hardest words I will ever have to admit, but the truth is that I failed my son, failed to keep him safe. Yes, this accident happened in moments. But, the fact that I have to live with for the rest of my life is that losing Levi was preventable. I am not trying to push blame off of my shoulders. But, I sure wish I had known these statistics before June 10. \n \n For the last month, I have fueled my grief and anger into action. Based on the research on drowning, I have created a non-profit called Levi\u2019s Legacy. My mission is to eradicate drowning completely. You can read more about my mission (and about designated supervision) at www.levislegacy.com. \n \n So, here I am, a grieving mother facing a future I would never have imagined. Lying in bed and sobbing will not bring him back (oh, but if it would). I don\u2019t want this role of water-safety advocate. I want 30 seconds back on June 10. But I am determined to share these facts I so desperately wish I had known. Levi\u2019s message has already spread, but now, it\u2019s time to take the next step, and it is a big one. \n \n American Academy of Pediatrics, I am asking for your help. We need you. I say this as someone who is married to a physician and who respects my own pediatrician very much. But, thousands of people have reached out to me over the last month sharing the same comment each time: \u201cI had no idea. Why didn\u2019t I know any of this about drowning?\u201d \n \n I am well aware how much a pediatrician has to cover during a well-child visit: build a relationship, answer questions, prepare for milestones, look into the ears of a squirming child. Pediatricians have thousands of topics they must be knowledgable of and share with parents. Therefore, American Academy of Pediatrics, you play a major role in setting priorities and equipping your pediatricians with the resources they need in order to inform parents and help eliminate this preventable tragedy. Parents of young children, especially in the age range of 1-4, should be given a handout that clearly explains the statistics on drowning. On the questionnaire, when I fill out it if my child can hold a crayon, hop on one foot, or sleep through the night, there needs to be a section on water safety. American Academy of Pediatrics, you have the platform and power to reach millions. Please, please join this cause. \n \n The AAP has a website for parents (www.healthychildren.org); on July 11, 2018, in the middle of summer, do you know how many times \u201cdrowning\u201d was displayed on the homepage? Zero. When I searched \u201cdrowning,\u201d I found a list of 17 total items, with articles from 2017 and 2014 being at the top. These articles include information that is so dull that nobody will read it (assuming anyone searches). They include information on how to tell if your child is drowning, such as: \u201ceyes closed / not using legs/ appearing to be climbing an invisible ladder.\u201d Not only is this a waste of words (is a parent seriously going to go through this mental checklist before saving a child?), but it just reinforces to people the incorrect assumption that drowning means splashing and yelling. \n \n A 3-year-old can drown in less than one minute: silently and without a struggle. The articles also fail to mention how often (the majority of times) drowning happens when not swimming. I am like any other mom: winging it, doing my best, and depending on parenting guidance from pediatricians and parenting articles. How else am I supposed to know what I am doing? Drowning needs to be addressed with as much concern as newborns sleeping on their backs to sleep, vaccinations, and car seat safety. Drowning is just as deadly and just as preventable. Drowning is a leading cause of death in children, and it needs to be treated as such. Can we please start talking about it? \n \n I want to make it clear that hundreds of pediatricians and other medical professionals have reached out to me about Levi\u2019s story. I am encouraged, humbled, and touched by how many of these influential people are already advocating for water safety and want to continue to be part of this solution. Thank you. I hope to get the same response from the American Academy of Pediatrics. \n \n I used to be the parent who would read a story like this one and immediately start scanning, looking for a loophole, desperate for the detail that would exempt me from this particular nightmare ever being mine. But, it turns out, tragedy does not play fair. My son is gone. And, yet, we are choosing to live a purposeful life in the midst of this ultimate despair. \n \n We have two daughters, Levi\u2019s older sisters, whom he adored, and we cannot let them lose us, too. This pain is unimaginable, but every second is a CHOICE. I am choosing to breathe, choosing to advocate. The pain and darkness threaten to suffocate. But when I choose to turn on the light, I see goodness. People are hearing Levi\u2019s message, questioning why they didn\u2019t know the truth about drowning, taking action. \n \n We have a chance to change the future, to save sons and daughters, grandchildren, nieces and nephews. Trust me, I never imagined myself in the role of water-safety advocate until I was thrust into it by my grief. Drowning is a leading cause of death and is 100% preventable. We can do better. We can fix this for our children. ||||| Bode Miller\u2018s wife, Morgan Beck Miller, does not want another parent to know the pain she and her husband are going through after their 19-month-old daughter drowned in a backyard pool accident. \n \n The mother of two, 31, shared a photo of her and Miller\u2019s late daughter Emeline Grier in the snow on Tuesday.

    "document": "Watching her boys play hockey, working nights at Tim Hortons and enjoying movies and walks in the park \u2014 it all sounds like a typical mom. \n \n But 40-year-old Andrea Giesbrecht stands accused of concealing the bodies of six infants after their remains were found in a U-Haul storage locker earlier this week. \n \n New details about Giesbrecht, also known as Andrea Naworynski, emerged from documents and a court hearing last month, in which she pleaded guilty to fraud over $5,000. \n \n Court heard that Giesbrecht has struggled with a gambling addiction for at least 14 years. \n \n Giesbrecht, 40, is charged with concealing the bodies of six infants in a U-Haul storage locker. (CBC) \u200bGiesbrecht was convicted of \"borrowing\" $7,850 from a 73-year-old woman, then writing bad cheques and not repaying her. \n \n \"I feel distraught and severely taken advantage of,\" the woman wrote in a victim impact statement. \n \n A friend of Giesbrecht took a different view, in a letter to court that she wrote before the sentencing. \n \n \"In the five years I have known Andrea I have come to love her as a friend and person,\" wrote the friend. \"She is a loving, considerate person and I have seen her drop everything to be there.\" \n \n The two met through their boys' mutual hockey team. Giesbrecht has two teenage sons who are involved in hockey and soccer. \n \n Started gambling in her teens \n \n Giesbrecht, an only child, was born in York, Ont., but lived for most of her life in Winnipeg's Garden City and Maples neighbourhoods. \n \n In the pre-sentence report, Giesbrecht was described as having a happy childhood, full of trips to the beach, Ukrainian dance, swimming lessons and church activities. \n \n She met her husband at the age of 16. That's also about the time she began gambling, something that she watched her parents do while she was growing up. \n \n Giesbrecht's gambling began with VLTs, and then card games. \n \n According to the report, Giesbrecht first believed she had a gambling problem 14 years ago, when she could not pay rent. \n \n During the worst of it, she said she could bet $500 at a time, many times over the course of a single evening, and would do this several times a week. \n \n She would borrow thousands of dollars from her parents to feed the habit \u2014 money she never repaid, and money they never asked her for, according to documents. \n \n Giesbrecht's parents have since died. \n \n Caused tension with husband \n \n Giesbrecht said this addiction caused tension with her husband and described gambling as the \"number one problem\" between them. \n \n As for her husband, Giesbrecht said he could easily become agitated. A probation officer once had to ask him to leave a meeting after he \"chastised\" his wife and \"refused to calm down.\" \n \n The same officer described Giesbrecht as polite and respectful, but noted that she could be \"highly excitable, easily distracted and unorganized.\" \n \n The pre-sentence report concluded that she posed a low risk of re-offending for fraud. \n \n Giesbrecht graduated from Red River College with a business administration diploma. In the past 10 years, she has worked for local organizations DASCH and St. Amant (which support people with disabilities), as well as a cleaning company. This spring, she began working at Tim Hortons. She also volunteers at Siloam Mission. \n \n Giesbrecht is now charged with six counts of concealing bodies of infants after the remains were found in a U-Haul storage locker in Winnipeg's West Alexander neighbourhood on Monday. \n \n U-Haul employees made the grim discovery when they went in to clear out the locker because rental payments had not been made. \n \n Winnipeg police initially said they believed there were three or four bodies found in various states of decomposition, but they later raised the total to six. \n \n Giesbrecht's next court date on the charges is Nov. 12. ||||| Photos View photos zoom \n \n WINNIPEG\u2014Police have charged a woman who was renting a storage locker where the remains of six babies were found Monday, but they say it could be months before they know who the infants were, how they died and how long they had been inside. \n \n Andrea Giesbrecht, 40, was arrested outside her home in north Winnipeg. Const. Eric Hofley said she faces six charges of concealing a body and one charge of breaching probation. \n \n Court records show that Giesbrecht, who has also used the name Andrea Naworynski, is a gambling addict with a low-paying job at a fast-food restaurant and recently admitted to defrauding a senior of several thousand dollars. \n \n Hofley said it will take an extensive forensic investigation to determine if Giesbrecht is related to the dead infants. \n \n More news at thestar.com: \n \n The state of the remains discovered Monday was such that police were initially unable to determine how many babies were in the locker. Their ages are still unknown, but they are believed to have been newborns, he said. \n \n \u201cThe forensics that are going to be involved in this investigation, they\u2019re numerous,\u201d Hofley said Wednesday. \u201cIt will be a long time before we\u2019re able to answer these questions \u2014 if at all.\u201d \n \n There are no homicide charges right now and police aren\u2019t interviewing any other suspects, he said. \n \n \u201cNothing is ruled out until all the information has been gathered and processed,\u201d Hofley said. \u201cBut, at this point, this is what is known and these are the charges that are appropriate at this time.\u201d \n \n Greg Brodsky, Giesbrecht\u2019s lawyer, said he had seen a preliminary outline of the charges and met with his client. \n \n \u201cShe\u2019s in bewilderment,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t talk to you about what she said to me because that would be a breach of solicitor-client privilege.\u201d \n \n Giesbrecht was initially arrested on murder charges, but those weren\u2019t the charges that were filed with the court, Brodsky said. That indicates the autopsy and forensic investigation isn\u2019t complete yet, he said. \n \n \u201cThe forensic examination is really important,\u201d Brodsky said. \u201cThere has to be an autopsy conducted and more investigation done in order to determine where this case is going.\u201d \n \n The breach of probation charge relates to two charges of fraud over $5,000 that were laid against Giesbrecht in 2012. She was given a suspended sentence and two years of probation at a court hearing three weeks ago after pleading guilty to borrowing money from a 73-year-old neighbour and repaying her with bounced cheques. \n \n Her lawyer at that hearing, Alan Libman, told the court that Giesbrecht\u2019s parents were longtime gamblers who had \u201cgambled away all their savings\u201d before they died and left taxes unpaid on the house that Giesbrecht now lives in. \n \n Gambling \u201cwas part of the family milieu,\u201d Libman is heard to say in a recording of the proceedings. \n \n Records indicate Giesbrecht was also unable to pay taxes and utilities, and borrowed money on more than one occasion from her neighbour. Eventually, she wrote two cheques to repay the woman. But the bank account the cheques were written on had been closed for two years. \n \n Giesbrecht wanted to repay the woman, but was caught up in addiction, Libman told the hearing. \n \n \u201cThe focus on this was to always pay it back. \u2018I was going to get the winnings. I was going to make the slot machine come through for me,\u2019 \u201d Libman said in reference to Giesbrecht\u2019s thinking. \n \n \u201cAll these things she talked about \u2014 her house being in arrears, not being able to pay bills \u2014 that all occurred because she gambled away all her money.\u201d \n \n Giesbrecht spoke briefly at her sentencing hearing and apologized to her neighbour for \u201cbringing her into this chaos.\u201d \n \n Provincial court Judge Janice leMaistre ordered Giesbrecht to perform 100 hours of community service and to repay her victim $200 a month during her two-year probation. She was also ordered to stay out of casinos and video lottery terminal lounges. \n \n Giesbrecht will be applying for bail on the new charges and a date for that hearing is expected to be set Thursday, Brodsky said. \n \n Workers were taking inventory at a delinquent U-Haul storage locker on Monday when they found the remains of what police believed were three or four infants. The U-Haul employees immediately called police. \n \n Even with an arrest, there are few answers to explain what may have happened. \n \n Hofley wouldn\u2019t say how long the remains were in the locker or how police believe they came to be there.",

Employees of the U-Haul facility opened the locker when Giesbrecht stopped making payments, and a court appearance late last month might shed light on why she fell behind. Giesbrecht pleaded guilty to defrauding an older neighbor of about $8,000 as evidence of a long-term gambling addiction came to light, reports the Winnipeg Sun. \"I feel distraught and severely taken advantage of,\" her 73-year-old neighbor wrote in a victim-impact statement obtained by the CBC.

    "document": "The US military's takeover of emergency operations in Haiti has triggered a diplomatic row with countries and aid agencies furious at having flights redirected. \n \n Brazil and France lodged an official \u00adprotest with Washington after US military aircraft were given priority at Port-au-Prince's congested airport, forcing many non-US flights to divert to the Dominican Republic. \n \n Brasilia warned it would not \u00adrelinquish command of UN forces in Haiti, and Paris complained the airport had become a US \"annexe\", exposing a brewing power struggle amid the global relief effort. The Red Cross and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res also complained about diverted flights. \n \n The row prompted Haiti's president, Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val, to call for calm. \"This is an extremely difficult situation,\" he told AP. \"We must keep our cool to co-ordinate and not throw accusations at each other.\" \n \n The squabbling came amid signs that aid was reaching some of the hundreds of thousands of people in desperate need of water, food and medicine six days after a magnitude 7 earthquake levelled the capital, killing more than 100,000, according to Haitian authorities. \n \n The UN was feeding 40,000 and hoped to increase that to 1 million within a fortnight, said the secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, as he arrived in Port-au-Prince yesterday. \"I am here with a message of hope that help is on the way,\" he said, speaking outside the severely damaged national palace. He also acknowledged \"that many people are frustrated and they are losing their patience.\" \n \n Ban said he has three priorities in Haiti: saving as many lives as possible, stepping up humanitarian assistance and ensuring the co-ordination of aid coming into the country. \"We should not waste even a single item, a dollar,\" he said. \n \n The plight of 80 elderly people at a partially collapsed municipal hospice just a mile from the airport, now a huge aid hub, showed the desperate need. The body of a dead 70-year-old man rotted on a mattress, nearly indistinguishable from the exhausted, hungry and thirsty people around him. \"Others won't live until tonight,\" an administrator, Jean Emmanuel, told the Associated Press. \n \n The Haitian government has established 14 food distribution points and aid groups have opened five emergency health centres. Water-purification units \u2013 a priority to avert disease and dehydration \u2013 were arriving. \n \n But with aftershocks jolting the ruins, bloated bodies in the street and severe shortages of water and food many survivors had had enough: an exodus trekked on foot out of the city to rural areas. \n \n The security situation worsened, with some looters fighting with rocks and clubs for rice, clothing and other goods scavenged from debris. In places the embryonic aid machine did not even try to organise distribution. Aid workers tossed out food packets to crowds and US helicopters took off as soon as they offloaded supplies, prompting scrambles in which the fittest and strongest prevailed. \n \n \"They are not identifying the people who need the water. The sick and the old have no chance,\" Estime Pierre Deny, \u00adhoping to fill a plastic container with water amid a scrum of people, told Reuters. \n \n Frustration over aid bottlenecks among donors became tinged by national rivalry as it became clear the US was taking ownership of the crisis. A vanguard of more than 1,000 US troops was on the ground and 12,000 were expected in the region by today, including marines aboard the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson which anchored offshore as a \"floating airport\". \n \n The Haitian government, paralysed by the destruction of the presidential palace and ministries, signed a memorandum of understanding formally transferring control of Toussaint L'Ouverture airport to the US. Former president Bill Clinton said he will travel to Haiti today to meet with government officials and deliver much-needed emergency supplies. \n \n The UN mission, which had a 9,000-strong peacekeeping force in Haiti before the quake, seemed too stunned by its own losses to take control. Its dead include its Tunisian head, H\u00e9di Annabi, his Brazilian deputy, Luiz Carlos da Costa, and the acting police commissioner, Doug Coates, a Canadian. \n \n Flights seeking permission to land continuously circle the airport, which is damaged and has only a single runway, rankling several governments and aid agencies. \"There are 200 flights going in and out every day, which is an incredible amount for a country like Haiti,\" Jarry Emmanuel, air logistics officer for the UN's World Food Programme, told the New York Times. \"But most flights are for the US military. Their priorities are to secure the country. Ours are to feed. We have got to get those priorities in sync.\" \n \n France, which as the former \u00adcolonial power expects a prominent role, \u00adprotested when an emergency field hospital was turned back. The foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, said the airport was not for the international community but \"an annexe of Washington\", according to France's ambassador to Haiti, Didier Le Bret. \n \n Brazil, which saw its leadership of the UN peacekeeping mission as a calling card of its burgeoning influence, was also indignant when three flights were not allowed to land. The foreign ministry reportedly asked Hillary Clinton to grant Brazil priority over chartered flights. Nelson Jobim, the defence minister, said Brazil would not relinquish command duties and suggested it, not Washington, would continue to lead UN forces. Analysts said it was vital command issues be resolved. \n \n The Red Cross and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res complained about flights with medical staff and equipment which were redirected to the Dominican Republic. \"We are all going crazy,\" said Nan Buzard, of the American Red Cross. \n \n The Obama administration has enlisted former presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton to spearhead relief efforts. In a series of interviews both men deflected right-wing accusations that the White House was seeking political advantage from the disaster. \"I'd say now is not the time to focus on politics,\" Bush said, as he sat beside his predecessor. \"You've got children who've lost parents. People wondering where they're going to be able to drink water.\" ||||| But with Haitian officials relying so heavily on the United States, the United Nations and many different aid groups, coordination was posing a critical challenge. An airport hobbled by only one suitable runway, a ruined port whose main pier splintered into the ocean, roads blocked by rubble, widespread fuel shortages and a lack of drivers to move the aid into the city are compounding the problems. \n \n About 1,700 people camped on the grass in front of the prime minister\u2019s office compound in the P\u00e9tionville neighborhood, pleading for biscuits and water-purification tablets distributed by aid groups. A sign on one fallen building in Nazon, one of many hillside communities destroyed by the quake, read: \u201cWelcome U.S. Marines . We need help. Dead Bodies Inside!\u201d \n \n Haitian officials said the bodies of tens of thousands of victims had already been recovered and that hundreds of thousands of people were living on the streets. A preliminary Red Cross estimate put the total number of affected people at 3.5 million. \n \n The United Nations also confirmed the death of three of its most senior officials in the quake: the secretary general\u2019s special representative for Haiti, H\u00e9di Annabi; his deputy, Luiz Carlos da Costa; and the acting police commissioner for the peacekeeping force, Doug Coates of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. They were meeting with eight members of a Chinese police delegation in the agency\u2019s headquarters, the Christopher Hotel, when it collapsed on Tuesday. \n \n Even as the United States took a leading role in aid efforts, some aid officials were describing misplaced priorities, accusing United States officials of focusing their efforts on getting their people and troops installed and lifting their citizens out. Under agreement with Haiti, the United States is now managing air traffic control at the airport, helicopters are flying relief missions from warships off the coast and 9,000 to 10,000 troops are expected to arrive by Monday to help with the relief effort. \n \n The World Food Program finally was able to land flights of food, medicine and water on Saturday, after failing on Thursday and Friday, an official with the agency said. Those flights had been diverted so that the United States could land troops and equipment, and lift Americans and other foreigners to safety. \n \n \u201cThere are 200 flights going in and out every day, which is an incredible amount for a country like Haiti,\u201d said Jarry Emmanuel, the air logistics officer for the agency\u2019s Haiti effort. \u201cBut most of those flights are for the United States military. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n He added: \u201cTheir priorities are to secure the country. Ours are to feed. We have got to get those priorities in sync.\u201d \n \n In a notice over the weekend, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said priority would be given to search and rescue, military and humanitarian aircraft, in that order. Flights were being routed through a command center at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida and pilots must tell controllers what they have on board and when they would like to arrive. \n \n American officials said they were making substantial progress. Mrs. Clinton said the military was beginning to use a container port in Cap Haitien, in northern Haiti, which should increase the flow of aid. \n \n The United States Agency for International Development was helping choose sites and clear roads for 14 centers for the distribution of food and water. Rajiv Shah, the agency\u2019s administrator, said the United States had moved $48 million of food supplies from Texas since the quake and distributed 600,000 packaged meals. It has also installed three water-purification systems capable of purifying 100,000 liters a day. \n \n Yet problems remain. American officials said that 180 tons of relief supplies had been delivered to the airport, but much was still waiting for delivery. While the military has cleared other landing sites for helicopters around the capital, they are thronged by people looking for help, making landings hazardous. \n \n Fuel shortages were mounting. At several gas stations around Port-au-Prince, attendants or customers said that even though the stations had fuel left in their tanks, there was no electricity to work the pumps. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

And Stephanie Bunker, the spokeswoman for the United Nations humanitarian relief effort, said Saturday that a United Nations logistics team was trying to coordinate with other agencies, and that the peacekeeping forces were trying to clear roads. \n \n Criticism of the United Nations \u201cmay reflect people\u2019s frustrations with the entire effort because it is such a grueling effort,\u201d she said. \u201cIt takes a long time for all this stuff to be cleared up and fixed.\u201d She noted that all modes of transportation \u2014 air, road and sea \u2014 were still limited. A shortage of trucks remained a problem. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Michel Chancy, appointed by Mr. Pr\u00e9val to coordinate relief, said that much of the aid to Haiti was coming to a government that was itself under siege. \n \n \u201cThe palace fell,\u201d he said. \u201cMinistries fell. And not only that, the homes of many ministers fell. The police were not coming to work. Relief agencies collapsed. The U.N. collapsed. It was hard to get ourselves in a place where we could help others.\u201d \n \n At the American Embassy in Port-au-Prince, American rescue teams continued to roll out of the gate. Most of their equipment had arrived, and at any given time, the teams were working on several different piles of rubble throughout the city. \n \n \u201cPeople need to get the message, we\u2019re out, we\u2019re doing stuff,\u201d said Craig Luecke, a coordinator with the search and rescue team from Fairfax County, Va., who has been tracking American efforts in advance of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s arrival here. \u201cMy Google Earth map is filled with American activity.\u201d \n \n Though the numbers are fluid, he said four American teams had helped pulled nearly two dozen survivors from the rubble. The State Department said 15 Americans were confirmed dead in the earthquake. \n \n Some airplanes, after circling the capital\u2019s airport, have been turning back or landing in Santo Domingo , in the neighboring Dominican Republic . Its airfield was growing ever more crowded with diverted flights. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re all going crazy,\u201d said Nan Buzard, senior director of international response and programs for the American Red Cross . \u201cYou don\u2019t have any kind of orderly distributions of food, water, shelter, clothing. The planes are in the air, the materials are purchased. It remains a profoundly frustrating situation for everyone.\u201d \n \n Among the aid groups avoiding the logjam in Port-au-Prince by entering Haiti from the Dominican Republic was International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n A caravan of eight trucks from the federation was creeping toward the Haitian border on Saturday morning, carrying medical equipment and aid workers. \n \n The group had originally planned to touch down in Haiti, but the delays at the airport forced them to divert to Santo Domingo, delaying their arrival in Haiti by about 12 hours, said Paul Conneally, a Red Cross spokesman who was traveling with the convoy. \n \n \u201cEvery minute counts, I know that, but we cannot be on standby to land at Port-au-Prince because it may not be for two or three days,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s problematic to go across roads, but it\u2019s a small price to pay.\u201d \n \n Mr. Pr\u00e9val, speaking at the airport, now the effective seat of the Haitian government, urged patience. He showed a map covered with red dots, indicating the worst-hit areas. When the earthquake struck, he said, \u201cWe in Haiti thought it was the end of the world.\u201d \n \n Mr. Pr\u00e9val said he was making food, water, medical supplies and the re-establishment of communication the priorities for his government. \u201cWe have a lot of work to do,\u201d he said.",

    "document": "It\u2019s any barbecue-lover\u2019s worst nightmare: You go to bed after enjoying a juicy burger or a smoky rack of ribs, only to awaken, covered in sweat and hives. You\u2019ve become allergic to meat. An increasing number of meat lovers in the United States and around the world have had this horrific experience in recent years, and it\u2019s all because of a tiny parasite. \n \n The culprit, the Lone Star Tick, spreads this potentially life-threatening allergy through its bites. Researchers don\u2019t know exactly how the tick spreads the allergy, but they have identified which component of meat causes the allergic reaction. Mammal meat \u2014 pork and beef \u2014 contains a sugar called galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal for short), and in people with the allergy, alpha-gal triggers an immune response that includes a massive release of histamines, much like your body would respond to other allergies. \n \n Wired reported that in 2004, University of Virginia immunologist Thomas Platts-Mills, Ph.D., identified the alpha-gal connection after examining blood work from people that experienced strange reactions not to meat but to a cancer drug called cetuximab. People in the southeastern U.S., they found, were 10 times more likely to be allergic to this effective cancer drug. Further investigation showed that the region was also home to people with meat allergies. Since cetuximab and mammal meat both contain alpha-gal, and the affected people\u2019s blood contained alpha-gal antibodies, the researchers hypothesized that the sugar was behind the allergy. \n \n Most scientists agree that allergies occur when a foreign allergen \u2014 like alpha-gal \u2014 is mistakenly marked as an invader by the antibodies of the body\u2019s immune system, which then releases chemical weapons to destroy it. One of those weapons is histamine, which triggers the inflammation necessary to deal with the allergen \u2014 but also causes the rest of your body to swell up, as well. \n \n Since cases of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, which is spread by the Lone Star Tick, also arise in the same southeastern region, researchers are pretty sure that it\u2019s the tick bites that are causing the allergies to meat and cetuximab. While the details of the allergy-spreading mechanism have yet to be understood, they\u2019re likely involved in priming the body\u2019s immune system to react badly to alpha-gal invasions. \n \n As far as scientists know, this condition is lifelong. Unfortunately, the reaction is life-threatening, too, as anaphylaxis can cause a person\u2019s airway to swell shut. \n \n These cases have previously occurred mostly in the southern, southeastern, and central U.S., reports of new meat allergies have surfaced in the northeast, including Pennsylvania and New York. It\u2019s unclear whether this means that the tick\u2019s range is spreading or whether the ability to confer this allergy has spread to other tick species. \n \n Original Could Kratom Solve the Opioid Crisis? \n \n If you want to avoid developing this allergy, take basic precautions when going out in the woods or high grass. Check yourself thoroughly when you get home, especially in your body\u2019s folds and near waistbands or elastic parts of clothes. And if you experience sweating, itching, or difficulty breathing a few hours after you eat meat, seek immediate medical attention. ||||| First comes the unscratchable itching, and the angry blossoming of hives. Then stomach cramping, and\u2014for the unluckiest few\u2014difficulty breathing, passing out, and even death. In the last decade and a half, thousands of previously protein-loving Americans have developed a dangerous allergy to meat. And they all have one thing in common: the lone star tick. \n \n Red meat, you might be surprised to know, isn\u2019t totally sugar-free. It contains a few protein-linked saccharides, including one called galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose, or alpha-gal, for short. More and more people are learning this the hard way, when they suddenly develop a life-threatening allergy to that pesky sugar molecule after a tick bite. \n \n Yep, one bite from the lone star tick\u2014which gets its name from the Texas-shaped splash of white on its back\u2014is enough to reprogram your immune system to forever reject even the smallest nibble of perfectly crisped bacon. For years, physicians and researchers only reported the allergy in places the lone star tick calls home, namely the southeastern United States. But recently it\u2019s started to spread. The newest hot spots? Duluth, Minnesota, Hanover, New Hampshire, and the eastern tip of Long Island, where at least 100 cases have been reported in the last year. Scientists are racing to trace its spread, to understand if the lone star tick is expanding into new territories, or if other species of ticks are now causing the allergy. \n \n The University of Virginia is deep in the heart of lone star tick country. It\u2019s also home to a world-class allergy research division, headed up by immunologist Thomas Platts-Mills. He\u2019d been hearing tales of the meat allergy since the \u201990s\u2014people waking up in the middle of the night after a big meal, sweating and breaking out in hives. But he didn\u2019t give it much thought until 2004, when he heard about another group of patients all suffering from the same symptoms. \n \n This time, it wasn\u2019t a plate of pork chops they shared; it was a new cancer drug called cetuximab. The drug worked, but curiously, patients that lived in the southeast were 10 times as likely to report side effects of itching, swelling, and a dangerous drop in blood pressure. \n \n Platts-Mills teamed up with cetuximab\u2019s distributor, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and began comparing patient blood samples. He discovered that all the patients who experienced an allergic reaction had pre-existing antibodies to alpha-gal, and cetuximab was full of the stuff, thanks to the genetically modified mice from which it was derived. With that mystery solved, Platts-Mills turned to figuring out what made patients so sensitive to alpha-gal. \n \n The best hint he had was the geographic overlap between the cetuximab patients and previously reported meat allergies. The area perfectly matched where people came down with Rocky Mountain spotted fever\u2014a disease carried by the lone star tick. But it wasn\u2019t until Platts-Mills and two of his lab members came down with tick-induced meat allergies of their own that they made the connection. \n \n Over the next few years Platts-Mills and his colleague Scott Commins screened more meat allergy patients and discovered that 80 percent reported being bitten by a tick. What\u2019s more, they showed that tick bites led to a 20-fold increase in alpha-gal antibodies. Since ethics standards prevented them from attaching ticks to randomized groups of patients, this data was the best they could do to guess how meat allergy arises. Something in the tick\u2019s saliva hijacks humans\u2019 immune systems, red-flagging alpha-gal, and triggering the massive release of histamines whenever red meat is consumed. \n \n Researchers are still trying to find what that something is. Commins has since moved to the University of North Carolina, where he\u2019s injecting mice with lone star tick extracts to try to understand which molecules are setting off the alpha-gal bomb. It\u2019s tricky: Tick saliva is packed with tons of bioactive compounds to help the parasite feed without detection. One of them might be an alpha-gal analogue\u2014something similar-but-different-enough in shape that it sets off the human immune system. But it could also be a microbe\u2014like a bacteria or virus\u2014that triggers the response. Some have even suggested that residual proteins from the ticks\u2019 earlier blood meals could be the culprit. \n \n Whatever it is, allergy researchers will be paying attention. Because, as far as anyone can tell, alpha-gal syndrome seems to be the only allergy that affects all people, regardless of genetic makeup. \u201cThere\u2019s something really special about this tick,\u201d says Jeff Wilson, an asthma, allergy, and immunology fellow in Platts-Mills\u2019 group. Usually a mix of genes and environmental factors combine to create allergies. But when it comes to the lone star tick it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re predisposed or not. \u201cJust a few bites and you can render anyone really, really allergic,\u201d he says. \n \n In the meantime, Platts-Mills, Commins, and Wilson are busy communicating the scale of the public health problem. Every day they check local news headlines to log new cases of catastrophic hamburger aversion, and spend hours on the phone gathering the latest intel from allergy clinics and academic centers around the country. They\u2019re building the first real red meat allergy incidence map of the US\u2014because state health departments aren\u2019t required to report alpha-gal syndrome to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And it\u2019s still rare enough outside the southeastern US that many doctors don\u2019t correctly diagnose it. \n \n Wilson is trying to get blood samples from all the new outbreaks, to figure out if the patients\u2019 antibodies correspond to the saliva of lone star ticks or a different tick species. That will tell him if the increases in the allergy are the result of changing range patterns, or if other ticks have developed the capacity to rewire human immune systems in the same way. That information would also provide further clues to the mechanism itself. As for a cure? There\u2019s not much science has to offer on that front, besides Epipens and veggie burgers.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Ticks are out in force this year, and there's one species in particular you should watch out for if you'd ever like to eat meat again. Experts say the lone star tick appears to be spreading from its home base in the southeastern US. Whereas other ticks can spread ailments such as Lyme disease, the lone star tick is bothersome because it is believed to trigger a potentially life-threatening and apparently lifelong meat allergy with its bite. The tick doesn't technically make people allergic to meat, but rather to a sugar molecule found in red meat known as alpha-gal. This alpha-gal allergy has typically been limited to the southeastern US, where the lone star tick is prevalent, but no more, reports Wired. Cases\u2014in which the consumption of meat can result in hives, difficulty breathing, or death\u2014have been reported in Minnesota, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and New York, per Inverse. Long Island has seen at least 100 cases in the last year. Researchers suspect the spread of the allergy coincides with the spread of lone star ticks, though it's also possible that other ticks are responsible. Either way, \"the nuisance level [for lone star ticks] is much higher than the black-legged tick,\" an expert tells the Weston Forum. \"It is aggressive and very abundant.\" Researchers are currently studying the effect of a lone star tick bite on mice to determine why it triggers the allergy.

Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| CNN has launched an investigation into claims that one of its star correspondents misled viewers in a report showing his emergency medical intervention on an earthquake victim in Nepal. \n \n \n \n Dr Sanjay Gupta, an acclaimed neurosurgeon and the network\u2019s chief medical correspondent was reporting on the devastating 7.8 magnitude quake that killed more than 8,000 people in the poor South Asian country in April, when he participated in an emergency operation on a victim. \n \n In both a report and interviews with CNN anchors, Gupta said he had been involved in an intervention which had saved the life of an eight-year-old girl suffering from major head injuries. Gupta was shown inspecting scans of what were said to be the girl\u2019s skull prior to the surgery, and then in the operating theatre at the Bir Hospital, in central Kathmandu. \n \n His actions, which came only two days after the tremor, were widely reported across the world. The girl was said to be suffering from a life-threatening blood clot in her brain. \n \n The accuracy of Gupta\u2019s report has now been challenged in an investigation by the Global Press Institute, an independent organisation that trains journalists in the developing world and publishes their reports. \n \n After speaking to doctors involved in the incident as well as patients and their families, the institute reported that Gupta had actually helped with an operation on a different patient \u2013 a 14-year-old \u2013 and that the eight-year-old named in the report had not sustained any serious injuries. \n \n The institute also reported that CNN had published a text story before the video segment aired that correctly described the girls\u2019 injuries. Hours later, the article was updated to remove one of the girls and misreport the others\u2019 injuries. The modified article reflected the reporting in the broadcast story. \n \n On Wednesday, Gupta attempted to clarify the situation on the network\u2019s morning news program, New Day, conceding that the patient he operated on \u201cmay not have been this eight-year-old girl but rather separately a 14-year old girl in that same hospital\u201d. \n \n He described the scene at Bir Hospital as complete chaos in the aftermath of the earthquake. Amid the havoc, details may have been confused, he said. \n \n \u201cThese facts are important to us ... we are trying to independently verify which child it was who got that operation at the time. There were many children, many people in the hospital,\u201d Gupta told viewers. \n \n \u201cWhen you report on these kinds of situations you take lots of different bits of information and you consolidate it and in the end you tell the story.\u201d \n \n Nepal was certainly in turmoil in the days after the earthquake struck, but that should not excuse the reporting errors, said Cristi Hegranes, the founder and executive director of the San Francisco-based Global Press Institute and the publisher of Global Press Journal. \n \n \u201cA pretty grave mistake was made \u2026 the excuse that things were chaotic shouldn\u2019t hold up for any journalist especially when that journalist is also performing a medical operation,\u201d Hegranes said. \n \n The publisher said the culture of celebrity reporting raises concerns about the way foreign correspondents report abroad, Hegranes said. She argued that local journalists wouldn\u2019t have made this mistake, and that her team, comprised of local female reporters, undertook this story to \u201cset the record straight\u201d. \n \n \u201cNow we know the identity of the patient on the table,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that this conversation can be the first of many about the role of foreign correspondents and celebrity journalists in America and how they cover the developing world.\u201d \n \n Gupta, a former candidate for US surgeon general, said he was shown several children who were suffering brain injuries. \n \n In a statement CNN said: \u201cJournalism is not brain surgery. But brain surgery is brain surgery.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe are so proud that Sanjay was one of the few reporters in Nepal to cover the earthquake, and while there was asked to help save a young victim\u2019s life. As we reported he assisted the surgeons at Bir Hospital by performing a craniotomy on a young victim. Some reporting has suggested it was not the young girl we, at the time of our own reporting in the midst of the crisis, believed her to be. We will try to verify that. Regardless, Sanjay spent a week in Nepal, helped save a young life in the operating room, and we couldn\u2019t be prouder of him. He has our full and unequivocal support.\u201d \n \n Dr Rajiv Jha, the senior neurosurgeon at Bir Hospital who conducted the operation, told the Guardian on Wednesday that Gupta had repeatedly asked to participate in an operation, rather than been requested by medical staff to help. \n \n \u201cI met him that day. He said he was a reporter and a neurosurgeon too. He said \u2018if you need some help, I can help you\u2019. We only had one [theatre] at the time and I had sufficient manpower,\u201d Jha said. \n \n After \u201ca few hours\u201d, Gupta was allowed to \u201cassist in one of the cases\u201d, Jha said. \n \n On CNN on Wednesday, Gupta maintained that he had been asked to intervene. \n \n Jha also said he had been surprised to see footage of the operation broadcast as he had refused to allow CNN to bring a \u201cbig camera\u201d into the theatre but believed a colleague of Gupta had filmed the intervention on a cellphone. \n \n \u201cIt was never discussed with me that it would be broadcast ... He never took permission to take film,\u201d Jha told the Guardian. \n \n There was no immediate response from CNN to the claim. \n \n Gupta has regularly stepped in to save lives while covering a story for CNN. He treated a two-year-old boy in Iraq, and examined patients on camera after the 2010 Haiti earthquake. \n \n Ethics experts have previously raised questions over the conflicting instincts of a physician-journalist. \n \n Connie St Louis, director of the Science Journalism programme at City University in London, told the Guardian in April that she was \u201creally, really worried\u201d about the ethics of filming a journalist\u2019s medical intervention. \n \n \u201cAs a journalist with medical training, do you really need to film the times when you get involved? There\u2019s certainly a possible confidentiality issue, as well as the potential for self-promotion. If you film the journalist doing the medical procedure, they become the story. My feeling is, why do it in Nepal when there is no way you could possibly do this in America?\u201d she said. \n \n",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 He didn't use the word \"conflate,\" but Sanjay Gupta used many other words to try and clarify why a report he filed from Nepal after the April earthquake there was apparently filled with inaccuracies, the Guardian reports.

Gupta tried to clear things up yesterday on CNN, admitting he may have mixed details up during the chaos. \"There were many children, many people in the hospital,\" he said, per the Guardian. \"When you report on these kinds of situations, you take lots of different bits of information and you consolidate it and in the end you tell the story.\" The neurosurgeon who performed the surgery on the older girl also tells the paper that Gupta wasn't asked to help, as Gupta claims, but that he harangued staff until they conceded; the surgeon also says he never gave permission for Gupta's team to film the operation. His statements underscore what some ethics experts are saying is a conflict of interest: being a physician and a journalist and filming your interventions. Meanwhile, the director of the GPI isn't buying Gupta's \"things were so crazy\" excuse. \"A pretty grave mistake was made,\" she tells the Guardian. \"The excuse that things were chaotic shouldn't hold up for any journalist, especially when that journalist is also performing a medical operation.\" CNN notes it's investigating, adding, \"Journalism is not brain surgery.

Industry leaders hope tablet devices and subscription-based digital editions can help newspapers stem, if not reverse, losses incurred after they began offering content online for free years ago. \n \n \"Newspapers are seriously trying to re-create the traditional print model in digital editions for tablets and e-readers,\" Fidler said. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Publishers wanted to pay Apple a fee rather than a cut of subscription and advertising revenue and are not happy with Apple's terms, he said. They had hoped to offer app editions as part of subscription bundles that include print versions of the paper. Instead, they must use Apple as an intermediary with subscribers. \n \n While the leap into the digital tablet market comes with short-term problems for newspapers, the iPad and future tablets will provide a new digital palette for publications to create sophisticated and lucrative ads, said Needham & Co. analyst Charles Wolf. \n \n \"I would say it's a risk, but I would argue it's a short-term risk,\" Wolf said. \"If you can put animation and multimedia into ads, that will greatly enhance reader views.

However, analysts expect high-quality tablets based on Google's Android operating system to eventually challenge Apple's lead. This will give publications more leverage in future negotiations, Fidler added, though Google does not yet offer subscriptions through the Android Market. \n \n While newspapers are anxious to get subscriber-based content onto tablets, there is some concern readers could drop print editions for app versions too quickly. \n \n \"Most publishers don't want to see a rapid migration to apps without a comparable growth in advertisement revenue from tablet editions,\" Fidler said. \"That would be disastrous.\" \n \n Contact John Boudreau at 408-278-3496. ||||| I\u2019ve criticized press coverage of Apple quite a bit. \n \n But I have to acknowledge something: The company\u2019s NSA-like secrecy makes it a bear to cover, and readers really want to read about Apple (me, too!). Those factors don\u2019t excuse weak coverage, but they complicate providing good coverage. \n \n Today, as an example, we have this San Jose Mercury News story reporting that Apple is about to launch a digital newspaper-subscription service. \n \n First, the sourcing is thin and unclear. There\u2019s nothing but the old passive-voice attribution in the lede: \n \n Apple is expected to announce soon a new subscription plan for newspapers, which hope tablets like the iPad will eventually provide a new source of profits as media companies struggle with declining print circulation and advertising revenue. \n \n And the second paragraph makes us doubt the accuracy of the first, relying as it does on speculation (at least as far as we know) from an outsider. \n \n Apple did not respond to a request for comment. But Roger Fidler, head of digital publishing at the Donald W. Reynolds Journalism Institute in Columbia, Mo., said Apple probably will take a 30 percent cut of all subscriptions sold through the company\u2019s online App Store, and as much as 40 percent of the advertising revenue from publications\u2019 apps. \n \n Finally, in the third graph we get some sourcing for the actual news: \n \n The Cupertino company has agreed to provide an opt-in function for subscribers to allow Apple to share with publishers their information, which includes vital data that news organizations use to attract advertisers, industry sources say. \n \n Anonymous sourcing is fine here. It\u2019s either that or nothing. But it\u2019s the only time any of the news angle is sourced in the whole story, and the only piece of news that looks solid. Look at the weasel words in the first two graphs\u2014all at critical places: \u201cis expected to\u2026 soon\u2026 probably\u2026 as much as\u2026\u201d \n \n Again, it\u2019s extremely tough to cover this company, but this isn\u2019t good enough.

The market is so starved for any nugget of news or \u201cnews\u201d about Apple that when a scrap appears, it gets rewritten and repackaged almost immediately by hundreds of online outlets. Pageviews soar. \n \n So let\u2019s be honest here, that\u2014rather than the difficulty of reporting around Steve Jobs & Co.\u2014is what causes news organizations to forego their standards when it comes to Apple (although in this case it doesn\u2019t hurt that everybody assumes that Apple is going to do some deal with newspapers anyway). \n \n Otherwise they\u2019d rather be scooped than have their work labeled \u201crumor,\u201d accurately, by a bunch of bloggers who know it when they see it. \n \n And if you want my guess (pure speculation\u2014labeled as such!) I\u2019d say newspapers won\u2019t give Steve Jobs 30 percent cut. Far be it from me to overestimate the business prowess and intelligence of newspaper executives, but surely they\u2019re not so dumb as to give him nearly a third of a recurring revenue stream. \n \n \u2014 Further Reading: \n \n The Press in the Reality Distortion Field: Gossip, rumor, rank speculation\u2014all on the table if it\u2019s an Apple product \n \n Steve Jobs, Holy Moses.

A woman was found inside dead from a gunshot wound, Bruley said in a statement. \n \n Authorities investigating a St. Paul man in Wednesday\u2019s fatal shooting of a UCLA professor discovered a \u201ckill list\u201d in his apartment that led them to the body of his estranged wife. \n \n Police found Ashley Hasti, 31, dead in her Brooklyn Park home shortly after 12:30 a.m. Thursday. Her name and the names of two UCLA professors were on the \u201ckill list\u201d found in the North End apartment belonging to Mainak Sarkar, 38, who killed himself after gunning down Professor William S. Klug. Police said Sarkar, who had two semi-automatic pistols and multiple rounds of ammunition, also intended to kill the second, unnamed professor who was off campus when he arrived. \n \n \u201cHe was certainly prepared to engage multiple victims with the ordnance he had at his disposal,\u201d Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said at a news conference. \n \n Sarkar apparently believed Klug had stolen some of his work while he was a doctoral student at UCLA. \n \n Sarkar\u2019s motive for Hasti\u2019s slaying remains unclear. The two were married by a justice of peace in 2011, said Hasti\u2019s grandmother, Jean Johnson. The couple split about a year later and Hasti moved back home to Brooklyn Park. \n \n \u201cThey just didn\u2019t get along,\u201d Johnson said. The two didn\u2019t divorce because Hasti couldn\u2019t afford one, Johnson said. Hasti was in medical school at the University of Minnesota and expected to graduate next spring. \n \n Gallery: Police ID man who carried out UCLA murder-suicide Gallery: Police ID man who carried out UCLA murder-suicide \n \n \u201cThe only enemy she had was him, I guess,\u201d she said. \u201cI never thought he would do something like that.\u201d \n \n The two met while Hasti, who grew up in the Twin Cities, was in school in California from 2009-10. Hasti attended a one-year post-baccalaureate pre-med program at Scripps College in Claremont. Sarkar seemed like a quiet, smart man, but he was \u201creal hyper,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHe had trouble sleeping. He just needed to see a doctor.\u201d \n \n Johnson said she didn\u2019t know whether there was any animosity or anger after the two split. \u201cI would ask about him and Ashley would say, \u2018He\u2019s got his own place and he\u2019s doing just fine.\u2019 \u201d \n \n At a midday news conference, Beck said Sarkar left a note at the UCLA scene asking authorities to check on his cat. That led police to the St. Paul apartment, where a second note with the \u201ckill list\u201d led them to Hasti\u2019s body. \n \n St. Paul police spokesman Steve Linders said he could only confirm that the department searched an apartment in the 1000 block of Agate Street, traced to Sarkar through police and court records, to assist another agency. He said a suspicious package was found nearby and rendered safe by the bomb squad. At the request of Los Angeles police, Brooklyn Park authorities arrived at Hasti\u2019s home in the 2400 block of Pearson Parkway and found her dead inside from a gunshot wound. \n \n \u201cWhat I can tell you is we believe she was deceased prior to the UCLA shooting Wednesday, but because it is so early in the investigation the timing [of her death] we don\u2019t know at this point,\u201d said Brooklyn Park Deputy Chief Mark Bruley. \n \n There were no other police calls that week to the home. \n \n Sarkar\u2019s only contact with police aside from Wednesday\u2019s search was in 2006 for a traffic accident. \n \n Hasti was stellar student \n \n At the time of her death, Hasti was enrolled for the summer term in the University of Minnesota Medical School, a university spokesman said. She\u2019d been enrolled in the med school continuously since 2012. In 2008, she received a bachelor\u2019s degree from the U in Asian languages and literatures, the spokesman said. \n \n Jason McGrath, an associate professor at the U, taught two of her undergraduate classes. Even 10 years later, he remembers her earning top grades and having a warm personality, he said. In a recommendation letter for Hasti\u2019s pre-med program, McGrath described her as \u201ca student of rare intelligence and talent\u201d who wrote a paper so good that he asked her if he could post it anonymously to the course website as an example to other students. \n \n \u201cShe was one of the best students of her time,\u201d he said. \u201cShe had an easy familiarity in talking even to her professors, which was appreciated because you like students who are approachable and don\u2019t keep you at arm\u2019s length.\u201d \n \n Hasti was a part-time liberal arts student at North Hennepin Community College from 2003 to 2006 and again from 2011 to 2012, said spokesman Mike Laninga. \n \n Beck said authorities believe Hasti was shot \u201cwithin the last couple of days,\u201d and that Sarkar arrived in Southern California \u201cvery recently.\u201d \n \n Sarkar lived in Minnesota for a number of years, and \u201cI don\u2019t think either of them expected to see him,\u201d Beck said of the professors. Beck said police have contacted the professor who was unharmed to make sure he is safe. \u201cI would characterize his response as knowing [Sarkar] had issues with him,\u201d Beck said, \u201cbut not to the level that would rise to homicide.\u201d \n \n The chief said police are looking for Sarkar\u2019s car, a 2003 Nissan Sentra with Minnesota plate 720KTW, in hopes of tracking his movements and determining a motive. \n \n Students attended a candlelight vigil for Prof. William Klug at the University of California, Los Angeles, on Thursday night in Los Angeles. A former UCLA graduate student killed a woman in Minnesota before carrying two semi-automatic pistols and a grudge back to Los Angeles, where he fatally shot a young professor on Wednesday he once called a mentor and then killed himself, police said Thursday. \n \n Beck told KTLA-TV that it appears that mental health problems were a factor in the UCLA shooting He said Sarkar apparently believed that Klug, 39, had released intellectual property that harmed him. \n \n Sarkar earned a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from UCLA in 2013, the university confirmed to the New York Times. \n \n On March 10, in a blog post that has since been deleted, Sarkar called the professor \u201ca sick person\u201d who stole his work. \u201cI was this guy\u2019s Ph.D. student,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe had personal differences. He cleverly stole all my code and gave it [to] another student. He made me really sick.\u201d \n \n On the block where Hasti lived, Gordy Aune, a neighborhood watch leader, said he talked with people who lived at the home \u201ca couple of times over the years.\u201d \n \n Wayne Hasti, Ashley\u2019s father, also lived there, \u201cbut they weren\u2019t around very often,\u201d Aune said.

The investigation into a murder-suicide on the UCLA campus took a more sinister turn Thursday... (Associated Press) \n \n LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The Latest on a murder-suicide at UCLA (all times local): \n \n 9:05 p.m. \n \n Hundreds of students have gathered at UCLA to remember a professor who was shot and killed by a former student, who then took his own life. \n \n The crowd gathered for a vigil Thursday night in Bruin Plaza, where the base of the bear mascot statue was covered with colored notes paying tribute to William Krug. \n \n The 39-year-old professor was shot in a campus office Wednesday by one of his former students, Mainak Sarkar, who then turned the gun on himself. \n \n Sarkar claimed Klug had stolen his computer code. Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck says Sarkar was mentally unstable and the theft was all in his mind. \n \n Authorities say days before the shooting, Sarkar also shot and killed his estranged wife in Minnesota. \n \n ___ \n \n 7:45 p.m. \n \n The grandmother of the slain wife of the UCLA gunman says the two of them \"just didn't get along.\" \n \n Jean Johnson, grandmother of Ashley Hasti, told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune that her granddaughter and Mainak Sarkar split about a year after they married in 2011, and she moved back to her hometown of Brooklyn Park, Minnesota. \n \n Johnson said the two didn't get a divorce because Hasti couldn't afford one. \n \n Johnson says Hasti was in medical school at the University of Minnesota and expected to graduate in spring. \n \n She says Sarkar was the only enemy her granddaughter had. \n \n Authorities say Sarkar shot and killed a professor at UCLA on Wednesday and later found a \"kill list\" he had made. \n \n A law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation tells The Associated Press Hasti was on the list. \n \n The official was not authorized to publicly discuss the case and spoke on condition of anonymity. \n \n ___ \n \n Reporting by AP writer Amanda Lee Myers \n \n ___ \n \n 7:45 p.m. \n \n The wife of a UCLA professor gunned down in his campus office says she'll miss him every day for the rest of her life. \n \n Mary Elise Klug released the statement Thursday via UCLA a day after her husband, engineering professor William Klug, was shot and killed. \n \n Klug says she is grateful for the outpouring of support from UCLA and elsewhere for what she calls an indescribable loss. \n \n She says Klug was so much more than her soul mate and knowing so many others share her sorrow has provided comfort. \n \n She asks that her family's privacy be respected so they can mourn. \n \n A campus vigil for Klug will be held later Thursday night. \n \n Police say Mainak Sarkar shot William Klug on Wednesday before fatally shooting himself. \n \n ___ \n \n 5:40 p.m. \n \n A law enforcement official says the Minnesota woman on the UCLA gunman's \"kill list\" was Ashley Hasti, and documents show they were married. \n \n Los Angeles police said the list was found in gunman Mainak Sarkar's Minnesota home and included two UCLA professors and a woman. \n \n Following Wednesday's UCLA shooting that left one of the professors and Sarkar dead, police went to the woman's home in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, and found her dead. \n \n Police would not disclose the woman's name. \n \n However, a law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation said the name on the kill list was Hasti, and a neighbor told The Associated Press that Hasti lived in the home with her father. \n \n The official was not authorized to publicly discuss the case and spoke on condition of anonymity. \n \n The neighbor, Gordy Aune Jr., is the neighborhood watch commander and said he sometimes spoke with the Hastis on his walks. He described them as quiet. \n \n Records in Hennepin County, Minnesota, show Hasti married Sarkar in 2011. It's not clear if they still were married. \n \n ___ \n \n Reporting by AP writer Amanda Lee Myers \n \n ___ \n \n 1 p.m. \n \n The man who carried out the UCLA murder-suicide wrote a dissertation in which he thanked the professor he fatally shot. \n \n The 2013 dissertation by Mainak Sarkar includes two lines about professor William Klug. It says: \"I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. William Klug, for all his help and support. Thank you for being my mentor.\" \n \n The document thanks several other professors and three friends, with Sarkar saying, \"I will always remember all the good time we had together.\" \n \n The dissertation, approved by Klug and four colleagues, is dedicated to Sarkar's dead mother, Ira Sarkar. It's titled, \"Coupled Cardiac Electrophysiology and Contraction using Finite Element.\" \n \n Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said Thursday that Sarkar drove from his home in Saint Paul, Minnesota to kill Klug and another professor named in a \"kill list\" found in Sarkar's home. Sarkar killed himself after killing Klug. The other professor named is safe. \n \n A woman on the \"kill list\" was found dead in her home outside Saint Paul, and authorities say it appears she was killed before the UCLA shooting. \n \n ___ \n \n 11:30 a.m. \n \n The Los Angeles police chief says a note about a cat at the scene of the UCLA murder-suicide led to the discovery of a so-called kill list and a dead woman's body in Minnesota. \n \n The note was found Wednesday after Mainak Sarkar killed engineering professor Bill Klug and then himself in Klug's office. \n \n Beck says the note requested that the finder check on a cat at Sarkar's residence in St. Paul, Minnesota. \n \n At the residence, investigators found a so-called kill list with the names of two professors and a woman living in Brooklyn Park outside St. Paul. \n \n Local police found the woman's body and believe she was killed before the UCLA shooting. \n \n Police believe Sarkar also intended to kill the other professor, who was off campus at the time. \n \n ___ \n \n 11:10 a.m. \n \n The Los Angeles police chief says investigators believe the man who carried out the UCLA murder-suicide went to the campus to kill two professors. \n \n Chief Charlie Beck says the second professor was off campus Wednesday when Mainak Sarkar (MY'-nahk SUR'-kahr) arrived armed with two guns and many rounds of ammunition. \n \n Sarkar killed engineering professor Bill Klug and then killed himself. \n \n Beck says the other professor's name turned up in a \"kill list\" discovered in Sarkar's Minnesota residence. \n \n A woman also named on that list was found dead early Thursday of an apparent gunshot at her Minnesota home. \n \n ___ \n \n 10:10 a.m. \n \n A blog post that appears to be written by a man who carried out a murder-suicide at UCLA calls the victim of the crime a \"sick guy.\" \n \n The blog, posted in March by a man identifying himself as Mainak Sarkar (MY'-nahk SUR'-kahr), says he and UCLA Professor Bill Klug had personal differences. \n \n The blog accuses Klug of stealing Sarkar's intellectual property and giving it to another student and says \"he made me really sick.\" \n \n It ends with: \"Your enemy is your enemy. But your friend can do a lot more harm. Be careful about whom you trust.\" \n \n Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck told KTLA-TV on Wednesday that the motive of the UCLA shooting was tied to Sarkar's belief that Klug released his intellectual property. Beck says UCLA asserts it was all in Sarkar's imagination. \n \n Family and friends of Klug describe him as a kind, gentle man who didn't appear to have conflicts with anyone. \n \n ___ \n \n 9:45 a.m. \n \n Police in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, say they found a dead woman when Los Angeles police asked them to conduct a welfare check at a local address in connection with the UCLA murder-suicide investigation. \n \n A Brooklyn Park police statement says officers responded early Thursday and found the woman dead of an apparent gunshot wound. \n \n The statement says early indications are that the woman's shooting happened before the UCLA shooting, which occurred at midmorning Wednesday. \n \n Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck tells KTLA-TV that a \"kill list\" was found in the Minnesota home of UCLA shooter Mainak Sarkar. \n \n The list contained the names of UCLA engineering professor Bill Klug, who was slain in the murder-suicide, another UCLA professor, and the Minnesota woman. Beck says the other UCLA professor is OK. \n \n ___ \n \n 9 a.m. \n \n The Los Angeles police chief says the man who carried out a murder-suicide at UCLA left a \"kill list\" at his Minnesota home that led authorities to find a woman's dead body. \n \n Speaking on KTLA-TV, Chief Charlie Beck says Mainak Sarkar drove to Los Angeles from Minnesota with two guns and killed Professor William Klug before killing himself. \n \n Beck says when authorities searched Sarkar's home in Minnesota, they found a \"kill list\" with the names of Klug, another UCLA professor and a woman. \n \n Beck says the woman was found shot dead in her home in a nearby Minnesota town. The other professor on the list is all right. \n \n Beck says it appears that mental issues were involved and says Sarkar's dispute with Klug appears to be tied to Sarkar thinking the professor released intellectual property that harmed Sarkar. \n \n Police are asking the public's help to find the car Sarkar drove to Los Angeles, a 2003 Nissan Sentra with the license plate of 720KTW. \n \n ___ \n \n 7:15 a.m. \n \n Los Angeles police have identified the man they say carried out a murder-suicide on the UCLA campus. \n \n A police spokeswoman, Officer Jenny Houser, says the gunman was Mainak Sarkar. \n \n Sarkar gunned down mechanical engineering professor William Klug in an office Wednesday before taking his own life. \n \n The shooting triggered a huge police response until authorities determined there was no continuing threat. \n \n Classes are resuming Thursday except for the engineering department, which will reopen next week. ||||| \"William Klug, UCLA professor is not the kind of person when you think of a professor,\" Sarkar wrote. \"He is a very sick person.

Earlier, the court heard from Pistorius' neighbour Annette Stipp. She said she heard three sounds which sounded like gunshots and moments later heard a woman's \"terrified, terrified screaming\"",

    "document": "Tongchang-ri, North Korea (CNN) -- As North Korea presses forward with a controversial rocket launch, journalists were granted a rare glimpse Sunday of the reclusive country's preparations. \n \n CNN was part of a group taken to the Sohae Satellite Launching Station in Tongchang-ri, in the northwest part of the country. \n \n North Korea announced last month that it would launch a rocket carrying a satellite between April 12 and 16 to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, the founder of the Communist state. His birthday on April 15, known as the \"Day of the Sun,\" is a key public holiday in the North Korean calendar. \n \n Pyongyang says the operation is for peaceful purposes, but Japan, the United States and South Korea see the launch as a cover for a long-range ballistic missile test. \n \n Firing the long-range rocket would breach U.N. Security Council resolutions, and Washington has suspended a recent deal to provide food aid to North Korea as a result. Japan has said it will shoot down any part of the rocket that enters its territory. \n \n \"If you look for yourselves with your own eyes, then you can judge whether it's a ballistic missile, or whether it's a launch vehicle to put a satellite into orbit,\" Jang Myong Jin, head of the launch site, said through a translator. \"That's why we've invited you to this launch site.\" \n \n Journalists -- who were not allowed to take laptops or cell phones to the site, but were permitted to film -- were shown the control center and the satellite that officials said would be shot into space. \n \n The rocket itself is 30 meters, or about 100 feet, long. It was white, with some red and blue paint. \n \n International leaders have urged North Korea to cancel the launch, but Pyongyang has refused to back down, insisting that the operation is for scientific purposes. \n \n The last time Pyongyang carried out what it described as a satellite launch, in April 2009, the U.N. Security Council condemned the action and demanded that it not be repeated. \n \n An independent European analyst who visited the launch site said he saw nothing obvious that raised red flags. \n \n \"I don't know what they want to do in the future, but today what we see is a space launcher,\" said Christian Lardier. ||||| (2nd LD) N. Korea's rocket fueling imminent \n \n SEOUL, April 9 (Yonhap) -- North Korea is expected to begin fueling a long-range rocket soon, the final step toward its launch set for as early as this week, a South Korean official said Monday.\"North Korea has only fueling remaining after completing the installation of three stages of boosters on a launch pad,\" the official said on condition of anonymity. \"Fueling is expected to begin soon, considering it usually takes two to three days.\"Pyongyang says the Unha-3 rocket will blast off between April 12-13 to put what it claims is a satellite into orbit. South Korea, the United States and other regional powers view the claim as a pretext to disguise a banned missile test.In an attempt to bolster its case, the North has invited foreign journalists and experts to observe the launch. Reporters from more than 20 media firms have arrived in the communist nation, according to state media.Foreign journalists and space experts have toured the launching station in the country's northwestern area of Cholsan, Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency reported Monday.North Korea told them Sunday that the satellite will gather necessary information on the distribution of forestry resources in the country, severity of natural disasters, crop estimates, weather forecasts and survey of natural resources during polar orbit.\"Seeing the satellite and carrier rocket ... they had deep understanding of the fact that the satellite launch is aimed at space development and use for peaceful purposes from A to Z,\" the Korean Central News Agency said in an English-language dispatch.The dispatch also claimed the foreign journalists and space experts \"admired to learn that the North's space science and technology has entered the practical stage of satellite.\"It also said the satellite launch \"is an inspiring deed and an event of historic significance of the nation.\"The rocket launch is timed to celebrate the April 15 centennial of the birth of North Korea's late founder Kim Il-sung, the grandfather of current leader Kim Jong-un.Weather is expected to be a key factor in North Korea's decision on when to launch the rocket. Considering that the regime has said it will accept foreign journalists until Thursday, a launch could take place on Friday or Saturday.Further adding to tensions, North Korea is also believed to be readying for a nuclear test.Satellite images show the communist nation digging a new tunnel underground in the Punggye-ri nuclear test site in the country's northeast, where it conducted two previous nuclear tests, first in 2006 and then in 2009, according to South Korean officials.The construction is believed to be in its final stage, the official said.Commercial satellite imagery showed piles of earth and sand at the entrance of a tunnel in the Punggye-ri site. The soil is believed to have been brought to the site to plug the tunnel, one of final steps before carrying out a nuclear test blast.South Korean officials said they cannot rule out the possibility of North Korea setting off a nuclear device built with highly enriched uranium this time, unlike two previous tests where plutonium was used.The North's nuclear and missile programs have long been a regional security concern. The country is believed to have advanced ballistic missile technology, though it is still not clear whether it has mastered the technology to put a nuclear warhead on a missile.(END)",

That's because plugging tunnels with dirt was the final step taken during its two previous nuclear tests at the Punggye-ri site, in 2006 and 2009. Meanwhile, the North is almost ready to start fueling a long-range rocket; it will be launched April 12-13, according to Pyongyang. While officials there say the rocket's goal is to send a satellite into space, the US fears the country is preparing a prohibited missile launch. The North has aimed to reassure journalists by inviting them to view preparations, Yonhap News reports. \"If you look for yourselves with your own eyes, then you can judge whether it's a ballistic missile, or whether it's a launch vehicle to put a satellite into orbit,\" the launch site's boss told the group of the 100-foot-long red- and blue-painted rocket, according to CNN journalists who were present.",
