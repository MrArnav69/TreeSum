    "document": "Resources Thank the PFMC for Protecting the West Coast Ecosystem \n \n The Pacific coast of North America supports one of the most vibrant and diverse marine ecosystems on Earth, largely because of the presence of thick schools of small prey fish such as Pacific sardines. Unfortunately, this crucial forage fish appears to be in the midst of a severe population decline. Its absence will be felt by dozens of species of West Coast seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna that depend on sardines as a major food source. In addition, because sardines have been a staple of commercial purse-seine fishing on the West Coast, their decline raises the potential for fishing pressure to shift to similar, but more abundant, schooling species of forage fish. \n \n \n \n The Pacific Fishery Management Council, which manages fishing in federal waters off California, Oregon, and Washington, should do two things to help maintain a healthy Pacific Ocean: \n \n Set conservative catch limits on sardines when the population is so low. \n \n Fulfill its September 2013 commitment to prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish species such as sand lance, saury, and lanternfish that are not currently managed or monitored. \n \n \n \n Cause for concern \n \n Populations of forage fish along the West Coast fluctuate widely, so a species can be abundant one year and dwindle unexpectedly the next. That\u2019s because forage fish are highly dependent on the upwelling of cold nutrient- rich waters to stimulate the growth of phytoplankton, their primary food source. \n \n The Pacific sardine fishery, immortalized in John Steinbeck\u2019s novel Cannery Row, collapsed notoriously the 1950s. The November 2013 population estimate of 378,000 tons is the lowest in more than a decade, far below the peak of 1.5 million tons estimated in 2000 and a major decline by historical standards. Geological records of fish scales deposited off Southern California indicate that the unfished sardine population fluctuated naturally between a low of 400,000 tons to as much as 16 million tons. \n \n \n \n Keeping an eye on the big picture \n \n Forage fish account for more than one-third of the global catch of marine fish and are mostly used for industrial purposes such as feed for livestock, poultry, and farmed fish rather than being directly eaten by people. Most forage fish landed on the West Coast are exported for purposes such as bait in tuna longlining in Asia or as feed for farmed fish. In 2012, the Lenfest Forage Fish Task Force, a group of eminent scientists from around the world, calculated that forage fish worldwide are worth twice as much when left in the water\u2014about $11.3 billion\u2014as they are when caught because of their value as food for commercially important predators. \n \n For further information, please visit: pewenvironment.org/pacificfish \n \n \n \n Write the Pacific Fishery Management Council at: pfmc.comments@noaa.gov ||||| The sardine fishing boat Eileen motored slowly through moonlit waters from San Pedro to Santa Catalina Island, its weary-eyed captain growing more desperate as the night wore on. After 12 hours and $1,000 worth of fuel, Corbin Hanson and his crew returned to port without a single fish. \n \n \"Tonight's pretty reflective of how things have been going,\" Hanson said. \"Not very well.\" \n \n To blame is the biggest sardine crash in generations, which has made schools of the small, silvery fish a rarity on the West Coast. The decline has prompted steep cuts in the amount fishermen are allowed to catch, and scientists say the effects are probably radiating throughout the ecosystem, starving brown pelicans, sea lions and other predators that rely on the oily, energy-rich fish for food. \n \n If sardines don't recover soon, experts warn, the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds and fishermen could suffer for years. \n \n The reason for the drop is unclear. Sardine populations are famously volatile, but the decline is the steepest since the collapse of the sardine fishery in the mid-20th century. And their numbers are projected to keep sliding. \n \n One factor is a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which in recent years has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast. While those conditions have brought a boom in some species, such as market squid, they have repelled sardines. \n \n If nature is responsible for the decline, history shows the fish will bounce back when ocean conditions improve. But without a full understanding of the causes, the crash is raising alarm. \n \n An assessment last fall found the population had dropped 72% since its last peak in 2006. Spawning has taken a dive too. \n \n In November, federal fishery managers slashed harvest limits by more than two-thirds, but some environmental groups have argued the catch should be halted outright. \n \n \"We shouldn't be harvesting sardines any time the population is this low,\" said Geoff Shester, California program director for the conservation group Oceana, which contends that continuing to fish for them could speed their decline and arrest any recovery. \n \n The Pacific sardine is the ocean's quintessential boom-bust fish. It is short-lived and prolific, and its numbers are wildly unpredictable, surging up and down in decades-long cycles in response to natural shifts in the ocean environment. When conditions are poor, sardine populations plunge. When seas are favorable, they flourish in massive schools. \n \n It was one of those seemingly inexhaustible swells that propelled California's sardine fishery to a zenith in the 1940s. Aggressive pursuit of the species transformed Monterey into one of the world's top fishing ports. \n \n And then it collapsed. \n \n By mid-century sardines had practically vanished, and in the 1960s California established a moratorium on sardine fishing that lasted 18 years. The population rebounded in the 1980s and fishing resumed, but never at the level of its heyday. \n \n Since the 1940s scientists have debated how much of the collapse was caused by ocean conditions and how much by overfishing. Now, researchers are posing the same question. \n \n \"It's a terribly difficult scientific problem,\" said Russ Vetter, director of the Fisheries Resources Division at NOAA's Southwest Fisheries Science Center. \n \n Separate sardine populations off Japan, Peru and Chile fluctuate in the same 50- to 70-year climate cycle but have been more heavily exploited, Vetter said. West Coast sardines are considered one of the most cautiously fished stocks in the world, a practice that could explain why their latest rebound lasted as long as it did. The West Coast's last sardine decline began in 1999, but the population shot back up by the mid-2000s. \n \n In recent years scientists have gained a deeper understanding of sardines' value as \"forage fish,\" small but nutrition-packed species such as herring and market squid that form the core of the ocean food web, funneling energy upward by eating tiny plankton and being preyed on by big fish, seabirds, seals and whales. \n \n Now, they say, there is evidence some ocean predators are starving without sardines. Scarcity of prey is the leading theory behind the 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up along beaches from Santa Barbara to San Diego in early 2013, said Sharon Melin, a wildlife biologist at the National Marine Fisheries Service. \n \n Melin's research indicates that nursing sea lion mothers could not find fatty sardines, so they fed on less nutritious market squid, rockfish and hake and produced less milk for their young in 2012. The following year their pups showed up on the coast in overwhelming numbers, stranded and emaciated.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment\u2014the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans\u2014which also depend on sardines for food\u2014are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)\u2014and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing. Last month, Pew Charitable Trusts warned that dozens of species, including whales, sharks, dolphins, salmon, and tuna, could feel an impact.",

Between 2003 and 2013, the camp expanded to include several new buildings, agricultural fields and almost two dozen guards, the committee says. The camp is estimated to house about 5,000 prisoners. \n \n As the Post\u2019s Chico Harlan has reported, gulags are alive and well in North Korea -- despite official claims to the contrary: \n \n Today Pyongyang operates six giant political prison camps as well as dozens of smaller facilities that emphasize \u201cre-education\u201d as well as pure labor. At all but one of those major gulags, prisoners stay for life and remain officially \u201cmissing\u201d even after they die. Amnesty International estimates that the North holds roughly 200,000 people at these gulags \u2014 one in every 120 citizens. \n \n In October, rumors spread that North Korea had shut down Camp 22, its largest labor camp. While that doesn\u2019t appear to be true -- satellite photos show well-tended fields and piled coals -- HRNK theorizes that downsizing and consolidation at other facilities could explain the growth at Camp 25. A crackdown on would-be defectors and political opponents could also be behind the expansion. \n \n In either case, it\u2019s impossible to do more than guess at the reasons for Camp 25\u2019s shifting borders. The gulags remain one of the most shadowy corners of the already secretive North Korea -- they only recently showed up on maps. And because most inmates are imprisoned for life, even to the second or third generation, few people have managed to share stories from inside the camp. \n \n Shin Dong-hyuk was the first known escapee when he fled to South Korea in 2008. \n \n \u201cIt is just a matter of time before Kim Jong Il thinks of this,\" Shin said in an interview with the Post, referring to video footage he\u2019d seen of the Holocaust. \"I hope that the United States, through pressure and persuasion, can convince Kim not to murder all those people in the camps.\" ||||| N. Korea seen as expanding gulags: satellite imagery \n \n By Lee Chi-dongWASHINGTON, Feb. 25 (Yonhap) -- North Korea is expanding its main political prison camps, apparently due either to hikes in the number of prisoners or the consolidation of its facilities, a human rights group said here Monday.The findings came from joint research by the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea (HRNK) and DigitalGlobe, a commercial earth image provider.An analysis of satellite photos of Camp No. 25 in the remote northeastern area of Chongjin-si showed that agricultural development, maintenance and construction activities have continued there, the HRNK said in a report.\"Between 2009 and 2010, the camp perimeter increased from approximately 3,710 meters to about 5,100 meters, a 37 percent expansion,\" it said. \"During the same period, the camp size increased from approximately 580 square meters to about 1,000 square meters, a 72 percent increase.\"It added the number of guard posts has also sharply grown.The HRNK said the reasons for the expansion could include an intensified crackdown on attempted defectors, the purge of political dissidents after Kim Jong-un assumed power, and the consolidation of the nation's political prison camp system.\"It appears that North Korea's vast system of unlawful imprisonment may be undergoing an alteration involving the consolidation of some of its political prison camps, and the expansion of others,\u201dGreg Scarlatoiu, executive director of the committee, said in a press release.If the dismantlement of some of North Korea's political prisoner camps and prisoner transfers to expanded facilities are in progress, he added, it is essential to ensure that the North Korean regime does not attempt to erase evidence of atrocities at the camps or execute the surviving prisoners.Multiple civic groups around the world estimate there are 150,000-200,000 political prisoners in North Korea.leechidong@gmail.com(END) ||||| Crawl of outlinks from wikipedia.org started March, 2016.

    "document": "(Reuters) - Diebold Nixdorf Inc and NCR Corp, two of the world\u2019s largest ATM makers, have warned that cyber criminals are targeting U.S. cash machines with tools that force them to spit out cash in hacking schemes known as \u201cjackpotting.\u201d \n \n The two ATM makers did not identify any victims or say how much money had been lost. Jackpotting has been rising worldwide in recent years, though it is unclear how much cash has been stolen because victims and police often do not disclose details. \n \n The attacks were reported earlier on Saturday by the security news website Krebs on Security, which said they had begun last year in Mexico. \n \n The companies confirmed to Reuters on Saturday they had sent out the alerts to clients. \n \n NCR said in a Friday alert that the cases were the first confirmed \u201cjackpotting\u201d losses in the United States. It said its equipment had not been targeted in the recent attacks, but that it was still a concern for the entire ATM industry. \n \n \u201cThis should be treated by all ATM deployers as a call to action to take appropriate steps to protect their ATMs against these forms of attack,\u201d the alert said. \n \n Diebold Nixdorf said in a separate Friday alert that U.S. authorities had warned the company that hackers were targeting one of its ATM models, known as Opteva, which went out of production several years ago. \n \n A confidential U.S. Secret Service alert sent to banks said the hackers targeted stand-alone ATMs typically located in pharmacies, big box retailers and drive-thru ATMs, Krebs on Security reported. \n \n FILE PHOTO: A man types on a computer keyboard in front of the displayed cyber code in this illustration picture taken on March 1, 2017. REUTERS/Kacper Pempel/Illustration/File Photo \n \n Diebold Nixdorf\u2019s alert described steps that criminals had used to compromise ATMs. They include gaining physical access, replacing the hard drive and using an industrial endoscope to depress an internal button required to reset the device. \n \n Reuters was unable to obtain a copy of the Secret Service report and an agency representative declined comment. Officials with the Federal Bureau of Investigation could not immediately be reached. \n \n Russian cyber security firm Group IB has reported that cyber criminals remotely attacked cash machines in more than a dozen countries across Europe in 2016. Similar attacks were also reported that year in Thailand and Taiwan. ||||| ATM \u201cjackpotting\u201d \u2014 a sophisticated crime in which thieves install malicious software and/or hardware at ATMs that forces the machines to spit out huge volumes of cash on demand \u2014 has long been a threat for banks in Europe and Asia, yet these attacks somehow have eluded U.S. ATM operators. But all that changed this week after the U.S. Secret Service quietly began warning financial institutions that jackpotting attacks have now been spotted targeting cash machines here in the United States. \n \n To carry out a jackpotting attack, thieves first must gain physical access to the cash machine. From there they can use malware or specialized electronics \u2014 often a combination of both \u2014 to control the operations of the ATM. \n \n On Jan. 21, 2018, KrebsOnSecurity began hearing rumblings about jackpotting attacks, also known as \u201clogical attacks,\u201d hitting U.S. ATM operators. I quickly reached out to ATM giant NCR Corp. to see if they\u2019d heard anything. NCR said at the time it had received unconfirmed reports, but nothing solid yet. \n \n On Jan. 26, NCR sent an advisory to its customers saying it had received reports from the Secret Service and other sources about jackpotting attacks against ATMs in the United States. \n \n \u201cWhile at present these appear focused on non-NCR ATMs, logical attacks are an industry-wide issue,\u201d the NCR alert reads. \u201cThis represents the first confirmed cases of losses due to logical attacks in the US. This should be treated as a call to action to take appropriate steps to protect their ATMs against these forms of attack and mitigate any consequences.\u201d \n \n The NCR memo does not mention the type of jackpotting malware used against U.S. ATMs. But a source close to the matter said the Secret Service is warning that organized criminal gangs have been attacking stand-alone ATMs in the United States using \u201cPloutus.D,\u201d an advanced strain of jackpotting malware first spotted in 2013. \n \n According to that source \u2014 who asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak on the record \u2014 the Secret Service has received credible information that crooks are activating so-called \u201ccash out crews\u201d to attack front-loading ATMs manufactured by ATM vendor Diebold Nixdorf. \n \n The source said the Secret Service is warning that thieves appear to be targeting Opteva 500 and 700 series Dielbold ATMs using the Ploutus.D malware in a series of coordinated attacks over the past 10 days, and that there is evidence that further attacks are being planned across the country. \n \n \u201cThe targeted stand-alone ATMs are routinely located in pharmacies, big box retailers, and drive-thru ATMs,\u201d reads a confidential Secret Service alert sent to multiple financial institutions and obtained by KrebsOnSecurity. \u201cDuring previous attacks, fraudsters dressed as ATM technicians and attached a laptop computer with a mirror image of the ATMs operating system along with a mobile device to the targeted ATM.\u201d \n \n Reached for comment, Diebold shared an alert it sent to customers Friday warning of potential jackpotting attacks in the United States. Diebold\u2019s alert confirms the attacks so far appear to be targeting front-loaded Opteva cash machines. \n \n \u201cAs in Mexico last year, the attack mode involves a series of different steps to overcome security mechanism and the authorization process for setting the communication with the [cash] dispenser,\u201d the Diebold security alert reads. A copy of the entire Diebold alert, complete with advice on how to mitigate these attacks, is available here (PDF). \n \n The Secret Service alert explains that the attackers typically use an endoscope \u2014 a slender, flexible instrument traditionally used in medicine to give physicians a look inside the human body \u2014 to locate the internal portion of the cash machine where they can attach a cord that allows them to sync their laptop with the ATM\u2019s computer. \n \n \u201cOnce this is complete, the ATM is controlled by the fraudsters and the ATM will appear Out of Service to potential customers,\u201d reads the confidential Secret Service alert. \n \n At this point, the crook(s) installing the malware will contact co-conspirators who can remotely control the ATMs and force the machines to dispense cash. \n \n \u201cIn previous Ploutus.D attacks, the ATM continuously dispensed at a rate of 40 bills every 23 seconds,\u201d the alert continues. Once the dispense cycle starts, the only way to stop it is to press cancel on the keypad. Otherwise, the machine is completely emptied of cash, according to the alert. \n \n An 2017 analysis of Ploutus.D by security firm FireEye called it \u201cone of the most advanced ATM malware families we\u2019ve seen in the last few years.\u201d \n \n \u201cDiscovered for the first time in Mexico back in 2013, Ploutus enabled criminals to empty ATMs using either an external keyboard attached to the machine or via SMS message, a technique that had never been seen before,\u201d FireEye\u2019s Daniel Regalado wrote. \n \n According to FireEye, the Ploutus attacks seen so far require thieves to somehow gain physical access to an ATM \u2014 either by picking its locks, using a stolen master key or otherwise removing or destroying part of the machine. \n \n Regalado says the crime gangs typically responsible for these attacks deploy \u201cmoney mules\u201d to conduct the attacks and siphon cash from ATMs. The term refers to low-level operators within a criminal organization who are assigned high-risk jobs, such as installing ATM skimmers and otherwise physically tampering with cash machines. \n \n \u201cFrom there, the attackers can attach a physical keyboard to connect to the machine, and [use] an activation code provided by the boss in charge of the operation in order to dispense money from the ATM,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOnce deployed to an ATM, Ploutus makes it possible for criminals to obtain thousands of dollars in minutes. While there are some risks of the money mule being caught by cameras, the speed in which the operation is carried out minimizes the mule\u2019s risk.\u201d \n \n Indeed, the Secret Service memo shared by my source says the cash out crew/money mules typically take the dispensed cash and place it in a large bag. After the cash is taken from the ATM and the mule leaves, the phony technician(s) return to the site and remove their equipment from the compromised ATM. \n \n \u201cThe last thing the fraudsters do before leaving the site is to plug the Ethernet cable back in,\u201d the alert notes. \n \n FireEye said all of the samples of Ploutus.D it examined targeted Diebold ATMs, but it warned that small changes to the malware\u2019s code could enable it to be used against 40 different ATM vendors in 80 countries. \n \n The Secret Service alert says ATMs still running on Windows XP are particularly vulnerable, and it urged ATM operators to update to a version of Windows 7 to defeat this specific type of attack. \n \n This is a quickly developing story and may be updated multiple times over the next few days as more information becomes available. \n \n Tags: atm jackpotting, atm logical attacks, Daniel Regalado, Diebold Nixdorf, Diebold Opteva, endoscope, FireEye, NCR Corp, Ploutus.D, U.S. Secret Service, Windows 7, Windows XP",

The ATM will then seem to be out of service when other potential customers show up to use it, and \"co-conspirators\" can then send an SMS or use an external keyboard to command the ATM to start spitting out cash \"like slot machines\" to a \"money mule\" lying in wait, per the Post. In past hacks, also known as \"logical attacks,\" the ATMs would churn out the bills \"at a rate of 40 bills every 23 seconds,\" per the Secret Service alert, cleaning out the ATM unless the \"Cancel\" button was pressed.

But it\u2019s not doing any of those things. \u201cFocus\u201d is ridiculous in every detail. It\u2019s a movie with no truth that teaches nothing and shows nothing, that has only its audacity to recommend it. Once that\u2019s realized, it\u2019s possible to take it for what it is and enjoy it, a little. \n \n Forget the con artists, and think of it as a movie about Will Smith\u2019s jaded charm and about how Margot Robbie looks completely different with her hair up than she does with it down. Think of it as scenes disconnected from other scenes, which are amusing for their own sake but that have little to do with each other. Then you won\u2019t be disappointed. \n \n One scene in particular captures the strengths and weaknesses of \u201cFocus.\u201d Smith and Robbie are in a VIP box at a football game, making small bets with each other, and an Asian businessman asks if he can bet with them. As the stakes rise, from $10 into the multiple thousands, the businessman goes from seemingly innocuous to sinister, and the personal dynamic is fascinating. You can\u2019t take your eyes off of BD Wong, who plays the businessman with an arresting mix of giddy playfulness and menace. \n \n But the scene itself is absurd, not just far-fetched, but groan-out-loud ludicrous. And the resolution \u2014 that is, the explanation that comes afterward \u2014 only makes it worse. \n \n Nicky (Smith) and Jess (Robbie) meet cute, with Jess trying to swindle him. When she realizes that she can\u2019t cheat a cheater, that she has hooked the Yoda of crooks, she begs him to give her lessons in stealing. He proceeds to give her a tutorial on picking pockets. Apparently, it\u2019s all about focus. \n \n The first hint that the movie is just plain silly is Jess\u2019 audition scene, in which she picks about a dozen wallets and assorted jewelry, in a series of intricately choreographed moves involving multiple accomplices. Pretty good for a first time out. The second hint comes when we see Nicky\u2019s operation \u2014 a massive warehouse in which wallets and jewelry are coming in from multiple sources. For some reason, all these independent pickpockets feel the need to kick up to him. Maybe they owe him. Maybe he did for them what he did for Jess, taught them how to become masters of the craft in just one five-minute lesson. \n \n Yet for all this, the nature of Nicky\u2019s business remains vague; it seems to be whatever the script wants it be at any given moment. So, though we\u2019re introduced to him as the Mozart of pickpocketing, we\u2019re also to understand that he\u2019s a swindler of international scope. Most of the film, in fact, takes place in Buenos Aires, with Nicky working a con for a major tycoon \u2014 but by this time, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. You just know that nothing can be as it seems. That really means watching the movie waiting for the trick, which is not the same as being fooled. \n \n There are some scattered good moments; for example, the disconcerting sound of race cars whizzing by outside, as two people converse in the track\u2019s cafe. They sound like powerful mosquitoes. And Adrian Martinez has a couple of funny scenes as a socially maladroit con artist. \n \n But the emotional core of the movie, the relationship between Nicky and Jess, lacks impact, mostly because you can\u2019t believe a word that they say, but also because Smith is not a strong leading man. Smith\u2019s idea of playing romance is to act cool, and his idea of playing cool is to act withdrawn and serious. That means the eclipse of the thing that made him a movie star in the first place, his personality. \n \n Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicle\u2019s movie critic. E-mail: mlasalle@sfchronicle.com Twitter: @MickLaSalle \n \n Focus \n \n Drama. Starring Will Smith and Margot Robbie. Directed by John Requa and Glenn Ficarra. (R. 104 minutes.) ||||| Musical chairs or Russian roulette? Sometimes there\u2019s as much tense drama in the casting of a Hollywood movie as there is in the finished product. This week\u2019s example: Focus, a caper film about a veteran con man and the young woman he takes as his accomplice. Ryan Gosling, then Brad Pitt and Ben Affleck were touted as the dapper con, while the female lead was reckoned to be played, at one time or another, by Jennifer Lawrence, Emma Stone, Kristen Stewart, Michelle Williams, Jessica Biel, Rose Byrne, Olivia Munn \u2014 basically, every working actress under 35. \n \n Since Focus conjures up a more relaxed time in Hollywood history, when the top stars radiated their golden appeal in romantic comedies about duplicitous souls, writer-directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa might have dreamed of Cary Grant and Grace Kelly, who paired in Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s 1955 To Catch a Thief. Grant had just hit 50, and Kelly was 25, but their upmarket glamour and wiles made a perfect match for a movie about an aging cat burglar and the young American heiress who dares to play his game. \n \n Ficarra and Requa, the authors of this script that everyone and nobody wanted to star in, finally settled on Will Smith, 46, and Margot Robbie, the 24-year-old blond Aussie who shared Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s bed (and a ton of cocaine) in The Wolf of Wall Street. The mix of longtime star and minx on the rise is one tasty element in the success of a movie that approaches the modest goals and effortless allure of a 60-year-old Hitchcock. \n \n \u201cI can convince anyone of anything,\u201d says Smith\u2019s Nicky Spurgeon, and the man is not boasting. The con in con man is short for confidence \u2014 what he radiates, and what he extracts from his marks before fleecing them. The blithe smile, the genial but steely authority he wears like a bespoke suit: that\u2019s Smith since his Fresh Prince days. \n \n What\u2019s odd is that in most of his movies \u2014 from the time he sauntered into action stardom with Independence Day, through a decade of dystopian sci-fi roles in I, Robot, I Am Legend, Hancock and the misfortune known as After Earth \u2014 Smith has been obliged to glower, macho-man style, as if Bruce Willis hadn\u2019t already patented the stoic scowl. Even in the Men is Black movies, the actor\u2019s cool was deadpan; the smile had to be inferred. So Ficarra and Requa deserve some credit in letting Will be Will in the star\u2019s first charm barrage since 2005\u2019s Hitch. \n \n Spurgeon (whose Urban Dictionary definition genteelly translates as \u201cthe man of all men\u201d) runs a con outfit of 20 or so filchers who work casinos, racetracks, football games \u2014 any place where cocky rich guys can be separated from their loot. He\u2019s on hiatus when he meets the creamy blond Jess Barrett (Robbie), who pulls a clumsy ruse that he plays along with simply from professional curiosity. Out of her league but a quick study, Jess learns to pick the pockets of smitten strangers and earns her bona fides. She\u2019s now ready to be Nicky\u2019s partner, and perhaps rival, in con. \u201cCongratulations,\u201d Nicky\u2019s aide-de-camp Horst (Brennan Brown) tells Jess, \u201cyou\u2019re a criminal.\u201d \n \n See the Most Memorable On-Screen Couples Columbia Pictures/Getty Images Silver Screen Collection/Archive Photos/Getty Images Columbia Pictures/Getty Images Popperfoto/Getty Images Archive Photos/Getty Images Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer/Getty Images United Artists/Getty Images Movie Poster Image Art/Getty Images Fotos International/Getty Images Columbia/Getty Images Paramount Pictures/Fotos International/Getty Images Lucasfilm NBC/Getty Images Vestron/Getty Images 20th Century Fox Hulton Archive/Getty Images Buena Vista/Getty Images Disney SGranitz\u2014WireImage/Getty Images Paramount Pictures NBC/Getty Images NBC/Getty Images 20th Century Fox/Getty Images Getty Images HBO/Getty Images Buena Vista/Getty Images New Line Cinema Focus Films Fox Searchlight Pixar/Disney 1 of 30 Close expandIcon 1 30 Close \n \n The dapper-con genre, which includes The Lady Eve and The Sting, with a brief recent revival in Now You See It, demands of its audience only a readiness to fall for the flimflam, as Nicky\u2019s marks do. The big gamble in Focus: it\u2019s a Will Smith movie that dares to be small. It leads its stars into swanky peril with a zillionaire gambler (B.D. Wong) and an Argentine race-car mogul (Rodrigo Santoro), in games the viewer is wise to trust no one. \n \n Ficarra and Requa, who pulled off a more brazen act of sex and treachery in I Love You Philip Morris, here just want to have and provide a good time. Which they do. They\u2019ll even take an R rating for the fun of some raunchy wit spouted by one of Nicky\u2019s pals (Adrian Martinez). \n \n And Robbie validated the filmmakers\u2019 trust at the end of a long casting process. Suggesting a modern Grace Kelly who wears her libido on the outside, and is a bit more self-conscious in her scheming, Robbie is really closer to a high-end knockoff of the young Michelle Pfeiffer. But that\u2019s O.K. too: it adds to the film\u2019s playful sense that everything, including star quality, is a con. \n \n Except for Smith, of course. He may not be the 21st-century Cary Grant \u2014 who could be? \u2014 but as a Hollywood charmer, he\u2019s still the real deal. ||||| The character suits Smith to a tee, given that his ability to persuade anyone of anything is the linchpin of his work. Though his career began as a rapper, it took the NBC hit comedy \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\" which began its six-season run in 1990, to establish him as an actor. As a street-smart Philly teen working his magic on the upscale California relatives who took him in, Smith found his sweet spot, and it started a trend \u2014 the actor charming his way into high society in \"Six Degrees of Separation\" or softening up his crusty crime-fighting partner played by Tommy Lee Jones in \"Men in Black.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Will Smith stars as Nicky, an established con man who takes on a new apprentice, Australian newcomer Margot Robbie's Jess, in Focus. They both love the con game, but who's playing who? Here's what critics are saying: Richard Corliss at Time is a fan. \"The mix of longtime star and minx on the rise is one tasty element in the success of a movie that approaches the modest goals and effortless allure of a 60-year-old Hitchcock,\" he writes. Smith \"takes a welcome break from glowering sci-fi roles\" and writer-directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa \"deserve some credit in letting Will be Will in the star's first charm barrage since 2005's Hitch.\" Steven Rea at the Philadelphia Inquirer admits Smith \"shows some of the movie-star wattage that's been missing from his recent pics. He charms.\" There's also \"combustible chemistry\" between Smith and Robbie, but the movie just \"disappoints,\" Rea writes. \"Even if you're willing to forgive its sinkhole plotholes and farthest-fetched conceits, the film ... ultimately makes no sense.\" Betsy Sharkey, on the other hand, says this \"rom-com-con\" is \"an irresistible reminder of all the reasons we first fell for the Fresh Prince so many years ago.\" Writing at the Los Angeles Times, she notes the romantic role of Nicky fits Smith perfectly, while Robbie is \"more than holding her own\" as his match. \"The scams are Rubik's Cube complicated, but what keeps you guessing is whether the romantic connection between Jess and Nicky is real or just another con.\" But Mick LaSalle at the San Francisco Chronicle isn't convinced. In a review titled \"Will Smith just stole $12 from your pocket,\" he argues Focus is \"ridiculous in every detail. It's a movie with no truth that teaches nothing and shows nothing, that has only its audacity to recommend it.\" Nicky and Jess lack \"impact,\" partly because \"Smith is not a strong leading man,\" he says. Viewers are left \"waiting for the trick, which is not the same as being fooled.\"",

    "document": "\n \n John Harris, left, editor in chief of Politico, and Jim VandeHei, Politico executive editor, speak to advertisers in Arlington, Va., on Jan. 19, 2007. (Jacquelyn Martin/Associated Press) \n \n Over the past few months and years, the hard-working staff here at Spoiler Alerts has tried to make a few useful suggestions for improving the quality of punditry during this campaign season. For example: \n \n Don\u2019t use Donald Trump as a vehicle for your particular hobbyhorse \u2014 you\u2019ll just get tarnished. Don\u2019t call for a military leader on horseback to rescue the country \u2014 the ones interested in the job are probably the last ones who should be president. Don\u2019t use Silicon Valley buzzwords to describe anything with respect to politics or policy \u2014 it means those words have been played out. Don\u2019t assume Americans care too much about foreign policy or national security. They don\u2019t. Don\u2019t call for a third-party candidate to enter the race because: (a) that candidate won\u2019t win, and (b) even if the candidate wins, the new president still needs to cope with a Congress that will remain a product of the two-party system. \n \n To be fair, I never actually wrote that last point up, mostly because I thought it was so obvious that it did not need to be said out loud. \n \n I bring this up because Politico co-founder Jim VandeHei\u2019s Wall Street Journal op-ed manages to ignore all of these warnings. Praising the plain language of Donald Trump? Check. References to disruption? Check. Calls for an \u201cInnovation Party?\u201d Check. VandeHei also leans hard on the \u201cNormal America vs. D.C. bubble\u201d trope, which will be a topic for another column. \n \n Today, however, Spoiler Alerts would like to focus on VandeHei\u2019s yearning for a military leader to set things right: \n \n Exploit the fear factor. The candidate should be from the military or immediately announce someone with modern-warfare expertise or experience as running mate. People are scared. Terrorism is today\u2019s World War and Americans want a theory for dealing with it. President Obama has established an intriguing precedent of using drone technology and intelligence to assassinate terrorists before they strike. A third-party candidate could build on death-by-drones by outlying the type of modern weapons, troops and war powers needed to keep America safe. And make plain when he or she will use said power. Do it with very muscular language \u2014 there is no market for nuance in the terror debate. \n \n There are many, many things wrong with that paragraph. But ignore the \u201cscare Americans and use force at will\u201d rhetoric for a few paragraphs. Do you know who would fit VandeHei\u2019s bill perfectly? Retired four-star admiral William McRaven. Former Navy SEAL. Former JSOC commander. Current chancellor of the University of Texas system. Architect of the Osama bin Laden raid. \n \n Even better, it seems as though McRaven is ready to enter the political fray. Except that, as my Washington Post colleague Craig Whitlock notes, McRaven\u2019s latest political intervention is \u2026 somewhat problematic: \n \n [McRaven] made clear that he was angry at the Senate for its treatment of Rear Adm. Brian L. Losey, the commander in charge of the Navy\u2019s elite SEAL teams and other commando units. Losey, who formerly served under McRaven, was denied promotion last month and is being forced to retire after several senators from both parties pressured the Navy to hold him accountable for retaliating against multiple whistleblowers. \u2026 McRaven\u2019s description of Losey as an innocent victim is at odds with the findings of the Defense Department\u2019s inspector general, which concluded that he had repeatedly violated whistleblower-protection laws. \u2026 Had he stopped there, McRaven\u2019s comments probably would not have attracted much public attention. Instead, he went on to slam lawmakers and question whether a fundamental underpinning of the American system of government \u2014 civilian control of the military \u2014 was frayed or at risk. \u201cThe greater concern for America is the continued attack on leadership in the military,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDuring my past several years in uniform, I watched in disbelief how lawmakers treated the chairman, the service chiefs, the combatant commanders and other senior officers during Congressional testimony. These officers were men of incredible integrity, and yet some lawmakers showed no respect for their decades of service.\u201d \n \n So the poster boy for VandeHei\u2019s new leadership is \u2026 a recently retired admiral who challenges civilian control of the military. I would be uncomfortable with this person in charge of determining the proper allocation of war powers between the different branches of government. By exploiting the fear factor. \n \n Enough with the op-eds that search for magical solutions to existing problems. Can we see some op-eds that address how to restore trust in Congress? Because that is the underlying problem that enables McRaven or VandeHei to go on these rants. ||||| I have spent the past two decades in the Washington, D.C., bubble\u2014the heart of Establishment America\u2014covering politics and building a company, Politico, focused solely on politics. But I\u2019ve also spent a lot of time in my hometown of Oshkosh, Wis., and my adopted hometown of Lincoln, Maine, two blue-collar towns in the heart of Normal America. \n \n Here are my two big takeaways: Normal America is right that Establishment America has grown fat, lazy, conventional and deserving of radical disruption. And the best, perhaps only way... ||||| Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Elle \n \n In Tuesday\u2019s edition of the Wall Street Journal, Jim VandeHei, the former CEO of Politico who left to start a still-mysterious new venture, has written one of the more clueless and despicable op-eds I have read from a current or former journalist. That it manages to be at once both sinister and utterly banal is its signal achievement. \n \n Isaac Chotiner Isaac Chotiner is a Slate staff writer. \n \n VandeHei\u2019s piece is ostensibly a common man\u2019s plea for a responsible third party\u2014one that would depart from the potential third-party paths laid out by Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump. In this and in this alone, it differs little from the Beltway pundits\u2019 quadrennial exercise in hyperventilation over the prospect of a third-party candidacy. But VandeHei also puts forth some random and unfocused ideas that unite only around a bizarre combination of demagogy and Silicon Valley\u2013driven innovation. Call it #Authoritarianism. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n VandeHei begins by laying out his credentials. He assures us that he actually spends lots of time in blue-collar \u201cNormal America.\u201d Naturally, the places he mentions as being \u201cnormal\u201d\u2014Lincoln, Maine, and Oshkosh, Wisconsin\u2014are small and more than 90 percent white. From this experience, VandeHei declares that \u201cNormal America is right\u201d: Washington \u201chas grown fat, lazy, conventional and deserving of radical disruption.\u201d These sentences, with their lazy assumptions about Washington mingling with the TED Talkese, achieve a sort of majesty in their bathos. \n \n VandeHei then explains the problem with Sanders and Trump; one is a socialist, and the other is too vulgar, as if Trump\u2019s language were the most offensive thing about him. VandeHei adds: \u201cBut if someone turned the critique, passion and disdain shared by the two movements into a new one, they could change the system in meaningful ways. Only an outside force can knock Washington out of its governing rut\u2014and the presidency is the only place with the power to do it.\u201d The rest of the piece offers a \u201ctemplate\u201d for doing so. \n \n And it\u2019s here that the column starts rotating between the vapid and the creepy. The former comes in large doses, as VandeHei calls for \u201ca true outsider\u201d who will help \u201cmandate that lawmakers \u2026 get outside of the D.C. bubble by holding months-long sessions in different sections of Normal America.\u201d But amid this sort of dreary nonsense, VandeHei lets the mask drop here and there. \u201cAnd exploit cable TV\u2019s addiction to whatever is hot and new,\u201d he writes. This is gross enough coming from someone in the media, but here is the next section, which is much worse, in full: \n \n Exploit the fear factor. The candidate should be from the military or immediately announce someone with modern-warfare expertise or experience as running mate. People are scared. Terrorism is today\u2019s World War and Americans want a theory for dealing with it. President Obama has established an intriguing precedent of using drone technology and intelligence to assassinate terrorists before they strike.

Do it with very muscular language\u2014there is no market for nuance in the terror debate. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n For a politician to call for the exploitation of fear is one thing. For someone in the media to call for it is another. For a media personality to call for it in the midst of a campaign that has seen unprecedented levels of bigotry and xenophobia is the ultimate monument to the Politico view of politics as a mindless exercise in signaling and brand management. (The bit about the ticket having military experience is a particularly nice touch.) \n \n Perhaps fearing that he had reached his quota of fascistophilic appeals, VandeHei returns to banality, offering up such beauties as \u201cUse the Internet revolution for the greater good.\u201d He then adds, \u201cAlso, call on Silicon Valley technologist [sic] to do tours of service to bring data solutions and efficiencies to our aging governmental systems.\u201d Terrific. \n \n You can tell where this is headed, can\u2019t you? \u201cWhy not recruit Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg or Sheryl Sandberg to head a third-party movement?\u201d VandeHei writes. \u201cMaybe we can convince Michael Bloomberg to help fund the movement with the billions he planned to spend on his own campaign\u2014and then recruit him to run Treasury and advise the president.\u201d So essentially the only way to fix our broken country that has been screwed over by elites is to give more authority to three of the most powerful people in the country.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 One of the co-founders of Politico makes the case that the success of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders shows that America is ready for a third-party movement. Those two have raised a \"terrific middle finger\" to the establishment, but neither presents a coherent governing strategy, writes Jim VandeHei in the Wall Street Journal. He wants a new party to combine the best of their movements, and even floats a name for it: the Innovation Party. VandeHei suggests someone like Mark Zuckerberg or Sheryl Sandberg could lead it, while Michael Bloomberg could provide financial backing and then perhaps run the Treasury. \"Right now, millions of young people are turned on by a 74-old-year socialist scolding Wall Street\" and \"millions of others by a reality-TV star with a 1950s view of women,\" writes VandeHei. His ideal candidate is instead someone from outside the political system who can talk to Americans in \"unvarnished\" language. He or she should also be from the military or select a running mate who is, because \"terrorism is today's World War.\" Click for his full column, which is meeting with some heated criticism.

He takes particular exception to VandeHei's suggestion that a candidate \"exploit the fear\" of Americans. \"Anyone who believes we are a meritocracy should read Jim VandeHei, who somehow rose to the top of journalism world,\" tweets Ian Millhiser of ThinkProgress. At the Washington Post, Daniel Drezner provides a critique \"of an op-ed gone horribly, horribly wrong,\" from VandeHei's use of \"Silicon Valley buzzwords\" to his call for a military leader to save us all.",

The trial was carried out from 2009-11 in two Midlands probation areas and found that offenders taking such tests were twice as likely to tell probation staff they had contacted a victim, entered an exclusion zone or otherwise breached terms of their release licence. \n \n Continuing concerns about the reliability of the tests and misinterpretation of the results mean they still cannot be used in any court in England and Wales. \n \n But it is expected that the compulsory polygraph tests will be used to monitor the behaviour of 750 of the most serious sex offenders, all of whom have been released into the community after serving a sentence of at least 12 months in jail. \n \n The tests involve measuring reactions to specific questions by monitoring heart rate, blood pressure, breathing and levels of perspiration to assess whether the subject is being truthful. The results will be used to determine whether they have breached the terms of their release licence or represent a risk to public safety and should be recalled to prison. \n \n The power to introduce compulsory lie detector tests was put on the statute book six years ago in the Offender Management Act 2007. On Tuesday MPs will debate secondary legislation in the form of a statutory instrument to come into force from 6 January 2014.

At least six revealed more serious offending and were found to pose a more serious risk to children than previously estimated. A further trial was ordered but at the time the Association of Chief Police Officers voiced caution about the adoption of such tests: \"Polygraph techniques are complex and are by no means a single solution to solving crimes, potentially offering in certain circumstances an additional tool to structured interrogation,\" a spokesman said. \n \n Polygraph testing is used in court in 19 states in America, subject to the discretion of the trial judge, but it is widely used by prosecutors, defence lawyers and law enforcement agencies across the US.",

The 12-year-old boy died at the scene and the baby was taken to Children\u2019s Medical Center of Dallas, but later died. \n \n Neither of the children were identified. \n \n Reyna said the children\u2019s mother and father and another child were treated for minor cuts and bruises. \n \n Walker was taken to a local hospital, but later transported to the Dallas County Jail. Officials were investigating if any other factors, including alcohol and slick roads, played a role in the crash. \n \n Walker, who has been convicted of theft and burglary in Dallas County, faces a charge of vehicular manslaughter. He is being held in the Dallas County Jail. Bail had not been set as of late Friday. \n \n Three other people were reported dead Friday morning after flooding in North Texas. \n \n Garland firefighters found Benjamin Taylor Floyd, 29, dead inside a submerged \u200bHyundai Elantra early Friday. It appears he tried to drive through high water on Campbell Road near Brand Road, said Garland fire spokesman Merrill Balanciere. \n \n Floyd, a Wylie resident, would have turned 30 next week, according to the Dallas County medical examiner\u2019s office. \n \n It wasn\u2019t clear how long the car had been under water. A search and rescue team was called to the scene\u200b about 8:30 a.m., but had to wait for the water\u200b level\u200b to \u200bdecrease before checking on the car. \n \n In Johnson County, authorities pulled a body out of a vehicle that was swept away overnight. About 11:40 a.m., authorities said they found another body near Mansfield but didn\u2019t release any other details. \n \n And in Burleson, authorities were still looking for the 70-year-old driver of a submerged vehicle. Around 1 a.m., a Tarrant County sheriff\u2019s deputy was swept away during a high water rescue in Burleson. \n \n Deputy Krystal Salazar stopped in the 11600 block of Oak Grove Road to help a stranded motorist, who was stuck in about 5 feet of water. Salazar, a bystander trying to help and the motorist were both swept away when the deputy tried to wade over. \n \n Salazar was found about two hours later clinging to a tree. She was transported to the hospital as a precaution. The female motorist had not been rescued from her vehicle, which was submerged. \n \n Fort Worth fire officials said that \u201crescue efforts have moved to a recovery stage.\u201d \n \n Most of the Dallas-Fort Worth area remains under a flash flood watch or warning Friday morning, with rain expected to continue throughout the day. \n \n Road closures have been reported throughout the area due to flooding.

The combustible mix that inspired them \u2014 economic woes and revulsion at corruption and repression \u2014 seemed to echo in so many other countries in the Middle East, American allies like Egypt foremost among them. \n \n Al Jazeera headlined its broadcasts: \u201cTunisia ... the street creates change.\u201d \n \n Mohammed al-Maskati, a blogger in Bahrain, put it more bluntly on Twitter. \u201cIt actually happened in my lifetime!\u201d he wrote. \u201cAn Arab nation woke up and said enough.\u201d \n \n Through the eight years of the Bush administration, democratization was at least a rhetorical priority of American policy in the Middle East, even as the United States maintained its support for Egypt, Saudi Arabia and other authoritarian governments in the region. On Thursday, as the protests in Tunisia were escalating, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton issued a scathing critique of Arab leadership and the region\u2019s political and economic stagnation. Her comments seemed one attempt to reposition the United States, which backed Tunisia\u2019s dictatorial leader as a partner against terrorism. \n \n Photo \n \n In the end, the most dramatic change in the old Arab order in years was inspired by Mohamed Bouazizi, the 26-year-old university graduate who could find work only as a fruit and vegetable vendor. He set himself on fire in a city square in December when the police seized his cart and mistreated him. \n \n A Facebook page called Tunisians hailed him as \u201cthe symbol of the Tunisian revolution.\u201d \u201cGod have mercy on you, Tunisia\u2019s martyr, and on the all free martyrs of Tunisia,\u201d it read. \u201cOne candle burns to create light and one candle beats all oppression.\u201d \n \n In Egypt, his name came up at a small solidarity protest. \n \n \u201cEgypt needs a man like Mohamed Bouazizi,\u201d said Abdel-Halim Qandil, a journalist and opposition leader who joined dozens of others at the Tunisian Embassy. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In Egypt, protesters, often lacking in numbers, are occasionally beset by divisions between secular and religious activists. The mass protests in Lebanon that followed the assassination of Rafik Hariri, a former prime minister, in February 2005 ended up deepening divisions in a country almost evenly split over questions of ideology, sectarian loyalty and foreign patrons. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Tunisians\u2019 grievances were as specific as universal: rising food prices, corruption, unemployment and the repression of a state that viewed almost all dissent as subversion. \n \n Smaller protests, many of them over rising prices, have already taken place in countries like Morocco, Egypt, Algeria and Jordan. Egypt, in particular, seems to bear at least a passing resemblance to Tunisia \u2014 a heavy-handed security state with diminishing popular support and growing demands from an educated, yet frustrated, population. \n \n In Jordan, hundreds protested the cost of food in several cities, even after the government hastily announced measures to bring the prices down. Libya abolished taxes and customs duties on food products, and Morocco tried to offset a surge in grain prices. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s the creeping realization that more and more people are being marginalized and pauperized and that, increasingly, life is more difficult,\u201d said Rami Khouri, director of the Issam Fares Institute at the American University of Beirut. \u201cYou need little events that capture the spirit of the time. Tunisia best captures that in the Arab world.\u201d \n \n Despite the enthusiasm, the scene Friday night in Cairo might serve as caution. \n \n The protesters who gathered at the Tunisian Embassy in the upscale neighborhood of Zamalek chanted slogans into a megaphone and waved red Tunisian flags. They went through a litany of the region\u2019s strongmen \u2014 from Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya to Hosni Mubarak of Egypt \u2014 and warned each that his day of reckoning was coming. \n \n \u201cDown, down with Hosni Mubarak!\u201d some chanted. \n \n \u201cBen Ali, you fraud! Mubarak, you fraud! Qaddafi, you fraud!\u201d others shouted. \n \n They were ringed by police officers in black berets, and outnumbered by them, as well. They had little room to maneuver. And an hour later, the protesters went their way, a Tunisian flag flying from one of the cars, as it ventured down a largely empty street. ||||| Hassene Dridi, AP \n \n Sponsored Links \n \n TUNIS, Tunisia -- Gunfire rang out Sunday in central Tunis near the Interior Ministry, as police and troops try to calm tensions after the president's ouster.Issam Chebbi, a senior member of the main opposition party PDP, said a gunfight also broke out Sunday between security forces and unidentified attackers in front of the opposition party headquarters. A big crowd was gathered in front of the building and heavy security was deployed in the area.Soon afterward, repeated volleys of gunfire were heard nearby, near the Interior Ministry. The source of the shots was unclear.The violence broke out as Tunisia sped toward a new future after its iron-fisted leader fled. A new interim president ordered the country's first multiparty government to be formed.But violence in many parts of the capital heaped doubt on hopes for a smooth transition to a new era.The omnipresent posters of ex-President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali were coming down, a vivid signal to citizens that Tunisia is moving on after 23 years of autocratic rule. Even the main state TV station changed its name.For Tunisians who protested for four weeks - with police shooting dozens to death - the announcement that a \"government of national unity\" would be formed opens the possibility of a leap toward democracy in this Muslim country in North Africa whose modernity clashed with Ben Ali's repressive rule.The nation must wait 60 days to see whether the party that maintained the ex-leader in power gets an upper hand in the new government, locking the old system back in place.The 74-year-old Ben Ali fled his country Friday for Saudi Arabia, literally chased out by angry legions of citizens protesting joblessness, corruption and lack of freedoms - a first for an Arab country. Numerous citizens laid a large measure of blame for his fate on his in-laws, supremely wealthy and considered just as corrupt.The interim president, Fouad Mebazaa, the former president of the lower house of parliament, was named Saturday - the second change of power in fewer than 24 hours. He quickly ordered the creation of a unity government that by its nature would include the opposition which had been frozen out under Ben Ali.\"We can start to hope,\" said a founder of the main opposition party, the Progressive Democratic Party, Nejib Chebbi. The question now, he said, is whether a new government will be pluralistic or again dominated by Ben Ali's ruling RCD party. \"If the RCD is dominant, we're not out of the woods.\"The Tunis airport reopened Saturday but the state of emergency declared Thursday continued. Instability ruled in the streets and spotter helicopters churned in the sky above the capital.Fire blackened the main Tunis train station, torched along with large stores and scattered shops as troublemakers defied a curfew Friday night.At least 42 people were killed Saturday in a prison fire in a resort town and the director of another prison let 1,000 inmates flee after a deadly rebellion.Assailants fired on police guarding the Interior Ministry in a bold attack on the symbol of the Ben Ali reign and police returned fire, battening down the city center. An Associated Press Television News cameraman near the scene saw two bodies on the ground. Their identities were not known.Street violence took a new form Saturday with marauding gangs sacking homes in at least one wealthy neighborhood and residents, armed with golf clubs, forming self-styled vigilante committees to protect themselves.Rumors were rife in a chaotic Tunisia, with some citizens voicing suspicions the gangs were made up of Ben Ali loyalists bent on sewing chaos in the country.Many Tunisians also expressed worries about what lies ahead.\"This all happened in three days. Maybe tomorrow we can't eat,\" said Mohsen Yacoubi, referring to the mostly closed shops in the capital. He said Ben Ali's departure should have been negotiated over time. \"Instead, it's war right away.\"Soldiers took up posts around Tunis, with tanks guarding strategic facilities like ministries and some major crossroads. The army presence was clear but discrete. Police were everywhere.Two quick changes in leadership since Ben Ali bowed out fed rumors that the army was the shadow ruler in a country without a government.Longtime Prime Minister Mohammed Ghannouchi, a Ben Ali ally, stepped stepped in briefly Friday to assume power after Ben Ali fled, leaving open the possibility that the longtime leader could return. But on Saturday, Constitutional Council President Fethi Abdennadher declared the president's departure permanent and gave lawmaker Mebazaa 60 days in which to organize new elections.Hours later, 77-year-old Mebazaa was sworn in and announced that all parties will be consulted \"without exception or exclusion.\"\"Ben Ali was a military dictator and everyone knows it,\" said Nouredine Jouini, 56, a former mechanical designer now guarding a closed up mall on Tunis' main avenue. But, he added, \"The people aren't dumb. We know the prime minister was appointed by defense forces .... But it won't stay this way. Tunisia will function.\"Streets were flush with police, for decades the most visible - and most feared - force in Tunisia. Cars were checked, particularly rental cars considered suspect as gangs combed the city.In the idyllic coastal resort of Monastir, a prison fire killed 42 people, coroner Tarek Mghirbi told The Associated Press on Saturday. The cause of the fire was not immediately clear. In Mahdia, a resort town further down the coast, inmates were set free after a rebellion by prisoners who set fire to the facility holding some 1,000. Soldiers opened fire and five inmates were killed, a top local official said, asking not to be identified because of security concerns.A Paris-based photographer, Lucas Mebrouk Dolega of the EPA photo agency, was in critical condition Saturday after being hit in the face by a tear gas canister.An Associated Press photographer saw soldiers fire warning shots and try to stop looters from sacking the supermarket in Ariana, north of the capital, to no avail. Shops near the Tunis bazaar were also looted.Public television station TV7 - just renamed Tunisian National Television - broadcast phone calls from residents of working-class neighborhoods on the capital's outskirts, describing attacks against their homes by knife-wielding assailants. Young boys were seen armed with long sticks along some streets.The wealthy were not spared, with some homes sacked in the upper class La Marsa neighborhood.Tunisian television has urged citizens to organize patrols, and men and boys in the tony Tunis neighborhood of El Menzah set up makeshift barricades and armed themselves with golf clubs and baseball bats for patrols against intruders.Businesses owned by member's of Ben Ali's family also appeared to be targets. The family of the ex-president's wife, Leila Trabelsi, has financial interests in wide-ranging sectors from banking to car dealerships. A branch of the Zeitouna bank in Tunis founded by Ben Ali's son-in-law was torched, as were vehicles made by Kia, Fiat and Porsche - brands distributed in Tunisia by members of the ruling family.\"This isn't good at all. I'm very afraid for the kids and myself,\" said Lilia Ben Romdhan, a mother of three in central Tunis. \"If (Ben Ali) had stayed in the country it would be better.\"Saudi King Abdullah's palace ended hours of speculation about where Ben Ali had fled to, confirming Saturday that the ousted president and some family members had landed in Saudi Arabia. The palace said the kingdom welcomed him with a wish for \"peace and security to return to the people of Tunisia.\"A source inside the kingdom said he was in the small city of Abha, about 310 miles (500 kilometers) south of Jeddah - taken there to avoid sparking any possible demonstrations by Tunisians living in the larger, seaside city of Jeddah. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.The whereabouts of all family members were unclear.The French government said some members are in France - former colonial ruler - but are \"not welcome.\" Spokesman Francois Baroin told France-Info radio that Ben Ali's family \"have not shown a desire to stay on French soil and are going to leave.\"Thousands of tourists were being evacuated from the Mediterranean nation, where tourism is a chief industry.Ben Ali's downfall sent a warning to other autocratic leaders across the Arab world, especially because he did not seem vulnerable until very recently and managed his country of 10 million better than many other Middle Eastern nations.However, the new era he dubbed \"The Change\" - starting when he snatched power from the nation's founder, President Habib Bourguiba, in a bloodless palace coup in 1987 - never fully materialized.The improved quality of life for many failed to keep up with the increased limits on civil rights like freedom of expression and a growing reputation as a police state - invisible to the tourists flocking to the country's Mediterranean beaches.The unemployment rate stands officially at 14 percent but is thought to be far higher among the young - who make up 52 percent of Tunisia's 10 million inhabitants.The self-immolation, and eventual death, of a 26-year-old university graduate selling fruits in central Tunisia triggered a dizzying series of riots that moved to the capital and, relayed by social media like Facebook, spun into general anger over the regime.Nicolas Garriga, Oleg Cetinic in Tunis, Hassan Ammar in Doha, Qatar and Angela Doland and Jenny Barchfield in Paris contributed to this report. ||||| The leadership of this troubled country changed hands for the second time in less than 24 hours Saturday as security forces and ordinary Tunisians struggled to quell mayhem that some have attributed to henchmen loyal to ousted President Zine el Abidine ben Ali Fouad Mebazaa, president of the lower house of the parliament, was sworn in as chief of state amid fast-moving political developments and chaotic lawlessness that have transformed Tunisia into a symbol of revolution in the Arab world.Mebazaa, 77, became the national president less than a day after Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia , handing power to his prime minister, Mohamed Ghannouchi, whose appointment sparked new demonstrations and questions about constitutional propriety. Mebazaa promised in a televised speech to consult with all political parties before holding elections within 60 days.\"I urge you all, and all dynamic forces of political parties, national organizations and components of civil society to put national interest first and to help the armed forces and national security in maintaining security and in protecting private and public property, and to restore calm and tranquillity to all citizens,\" he said.With video of the uprising airing constantly on satellite television throughout the region, the events in Tunisia have captivated Arabs who hope it will inspire the toppling of other entrenched authoritarian regimes. That has raised the stakes for a people's power rebellion that could be threatened by the continuing violence.Tension and confusion gripped the streets, where many residents spent hours searching for bread and other food.Army tanks were positioned in the heart of Tunis, along the capital's main Avenue Habib Bourguiba . Death toll figures were not available, but scores of people across the nation have died in the unrest, including 57 reportedly killed Saturday in an inferno at a prison.As a 5 p.m. curfew approached, surly young men appeared to be gathering steam for another night of clashes with police officers, who stalked sidewalks wearing riot gear and holding clubs, menacing pedestrians who didn't move quickly enough.As night fell, occasional bursts of gunfire could be heard throughout Tunis and its suburbs, as well as the occasional roar of army helicopters roaming the skies.Common criminals and overzealous young demonstrators have contributed to the spasm of looting and violence in this previously placid and tightly controlled North African country. But just as loyalists to Iraq's Saddam Hussein set off fires and released prisoners in the wake of his 2003 ouster by U.S.-led forces, security officials loyal to the autocratic Ben Ali, many Tunisians suspect, have played a role in the unrest here.\"These are not ordinary people,\" said Bochra Belhaj Hmida, a lawyer and human rights activist. \"They are at risk because they tortured people. They are going to be condemned for their crimes if they are arrested.\"The country's constitutional court ruled Saturday that the departure of Ben Ali, driven out of office Friday after weeks of protests over rising food prices, unemployment and a lack of political freedom, was permanent. And France , the former colonial power that had long backed Ben Ali, asked relatives of the former president who had entered the country to leave and announced the launch of investigations of suspicious money transfers between Tunisia and France.Many Tunisians suspect that former members of Ben Ali's presidential guard, his most brutal adjutants in the Interior Ministry and loyalists in his ruling Constitutional Democratic Rally were fomenting the violence to discredit the protesters and contribute to chaos that would justify harsh security measures.\"These are people from the ex-government who are orchestrating everything,\" said Mokhtar Trifi, president of the Tunisian Human Rights League, an opposition group.Officials of the interim government could not be reached for comment. But there were signs that security forces loyal to the interim government, especially the army, were trying to beat back efforts by the former regime to spread chaos.Al Jazeera pan-Arab satellite television network reported the arrest of Ali Seriati, the head of Ben Ali's despised presidential guard. In the capital's November 7 Square, police fatally shot two of their own, explaining to a European journalist at the scene that the pair were former regime loyalists who were responsible for crimes.Mohammad ben Ghomdhan, head of a small socialist political party, Renewal, that is conferring with the interim government, said officials had told him Saturday that during the preceding two days, soldiers at army checkpoints had seized two armored Interior Ministry vehicles filled with weapons.On television shows, on the Internet and in the few cafes that remained open in the capital, many said they feared that security officials close to Ben Ali also were responsible for an outbreak of violence at the country's prisons. Al Jazeera cited a medical source as saying 57 people had died in a fire at a prison in Monastir, about 80 miles southeast of the capital, amid reports of attempted escapes at at least two other detention facilities.Al Jazeera also reported that political prisoners held at Borj Roumi prison in the northern port city of Bizerte had been released. It was not clear who had given the order to free them.On the streets, the tension between the population and the police, which answers to the Interior Ministry, was palpable, as was the higher status that Tunisians accord their army.When police officers tried to detain a young man at the square near the Republic Metro station, a crowd waiting for a tram erupted with fury, moving toward the officers and tossing rocks. The police fired teargas volleys, but the crowd only got angrier and moved closer.\"We are not afraid!\" they chanted.A group of soldiers ran into the square to intervene, forcing the police to release the man. The crowd cheered the man as he boarded the tramway platform.Numerous videos posted on the Internet during the weeks of protest showed police officers in uniform smashing shop windows and setting fires. In the hours after Ben Ali stepped down, residents of the Manar and Menzah neighborhoods of Tunis reported spotting vans dropping off people armed with clubs and canisters of gasoline to start fires. Some of the witnesses said the vehicles were escorted by police.Ben Ghomdhan said that unlike in post-invasion Iraq, where the U.S. disbanded the army and regime stalwarts were able to organize an insurgency in the ensuing power vacuum, Tunisia's interim government and relatively popular army were already a step ahead of the Ben Ali loyalists.\"I think they cannot win,\" he said. \"These networks have been identified, from the information that I have so far. Their chief, Seriati, has been arrested, and many of his networks have already been arrested.\"",

    "document": "\n \n Ty is a 6-year-old brindle and white Bull Terrier (Photo via Frank Romano) \n \n A man is searching for his dog after he went missing Friday night, apparently from a cargo area at LAX. \n \n Frank Romano said he was flying to Tampa out of LAX via Delta Airlines Friday night with his family and his 6-year-old bull terrier, Ty. Ty was in the cargo area in a carrier Romano said he had purchased from PetCo. Romano's family boarded the plane, but a Delta employee escorted him off the plane and told him that an hour earlier, Ty had chewed through the door of his pet kennel and escaped. Romano found this odd. \n \n \"I don't know how he could've bit through his kennel though when it had a metal door and was made of hard plastic,\" he said. \n \n Romano says the story about what happened to his \"best friend\" gets even more bizarre from there. For one, he doesn't understand why the Delta employee didn't tell him about Ty's escape immediately. Also, he said he was told that the kennel Ty escaped from would appear in baggage claim, but it never did. \n \n Romano said he searched around LAX, but Ty never turned up. The next day, his family flew to Tampa as planned. Romano has called Delta several times, but the situation has only become more confusing. \n \n \"They give us the run around,\" he told LAist. \"Even gave us a number to the cargo place at Tampa airport saying he was there. We called and said they had no dogs.\" \n \n If this story sounds odd, you might be disheartened to know that it's not uncommon. Delta apparently has a history of losing pets. The airline has allegedly lost so many dogs under their care that someone created a Change.org petition with over 2,000 signatures to demand they take responsibility. \n \n In 2011, a New York man bought a puppy in Alabama, then arranged to have the puppy sent back to New York along with him. Delta temporarily misplaced the dog, then found it in Atlanta. In 2011, a German Shepherd headed from California to Germany to join its owner\u2014a couple in the Army\u2014got loose in Atlanta while under Delta's care. That dog was later hit by a car and died. Another unsatisfied Delta customer reported that he and his girlfriend had adopted a stray dog in Mexico in 2010, spent money nursing him to health and then made plans to bring the dog back to their home in Canada with them. Delta allegedly also gave them the run-around as to where the dog was with a similar story about an escape, but couldn't seem to produce the dog. \n \n Delta also mixed up two children in 2010\u2014a boy and a girl\u2014sending one to Boston and the other to Cleveland when it was meant to be the other way around. \n \n Romano is still looking for Ty, and still doesn't have any concrete answers from Delta. A representative at Delta told LAist that they would look into this and get back to us tomorrow. We're hoping we see Ty and Romano reunited soon. \n \n Update, November 7, 12 p.m.: Delta has provided us with the following statement: \n \n Delta continues to investigate what happened, but early indications show that procedures were followed, and the dog may have compromised the kennel on its own. Delta immediately worked with LAX airport teams and the customer to locate the dog but was unsuccessful. We remain in contact with this customer, and we are fully supporting the search for their pet. Delta understands that pets are important members of the family and regrets this occurred while this pet was entrusted to our care. ||||| Update: In December 2010, Delta lost yet another dog. This time, a German Shepherd mix named Nala was being flown to Germany. During her layover in Atlanta, the airlines called the owner, saying she was trying to break out of her crate so they wanted to keep her overnight. The next day, they suddenly couldn't find the owner's number once Nala escaped. She was found dead along the highway about a week later. \"It is really hard for me to believe their story,\" said the owner. But, like the others, she hasn't been able to receive any answers from Delta. \n \n Update: In November 2010, more problems were reported with Delta transporting dogs. While flying a family's two dogs from Germany to Washington state, via Atlanta, one died en route and the other was \"misrouted\" several times before finally being reunited with her family. \n \n The fact that Delta could so egregiously mishandle a dog after the loss of her companion and all the publicity around the other cases of incompetent animal transport shows that they are not committed to safe pet travel. Delta Airlines needs to investigate these cases, as well as conduct a review to update their policies and procedures around animal transport. \n \n ***** \n \n In May 2010, Delta Airlines lost a dog who had been rescued in Mexico and was on his way to his new home in Canada. After giving the owners the run-around, they refunded the pet fee in the form of a $200 voucher. After public outrage, they offered more airline vouchers and reimbursement for what the couple had spent on vet care in Mexico. The dog has not been found, and Delta hasn't offered help to the rescue groups on-the-ground who are still looking for him. \n \n In June 2010, a week after sending two kids to the wrong cities, they flew a puppy to California who was supposed to be headed for Maine. Again, Delta has not been forthcoming with information on what happened, whether the puppy - who was diagnosed by a vet with dehydration and pneumonia - received any care or attention from staff, how the mistake happened, and whether they'll compensate the owner in any reasonable way. \n \n It is unacceptable for Delta Airlines to be so careless when transporting live animals. There's no amount of money - or airline vouchers - that can make up for a lost pet. Tell Delta to launch an internal investigation on what went wrong and how they will prevent it from happening again in the future.",

    "document": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), a cell-based gene therapy, to treat adult patients with certain types of large B-cell lymphoma who have not responded to or who have relapsed after at least two other kinds of treatment. Yescarta, a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, is the second gene therapy approved by the FDA and the first for certain types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). \n \n \u201cToday marks another milestone in the development of a whole new scientific paradigm for the treatment of serious diseases. In just several decades, gene therapy has gone from being a promising concept to a practical solution to deadly and largely untreatable forms of cancer,\u201d said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. \u201cThis approval demonstrates the continued momentum of this promising new area of medicine and we\u2019re committed to supporting and helping expedite the development of these products. We will soon release a comprehensive policy to address how we plan to support the development of cell-based regenerative medicine. That policy will also clarify how we will apply our expedited programs to breakthrough products that use CAR-T cells and other gene therapies. We remain committed to supporting the efficient development of safe and effective treatments that leverage these new scientific platforms.\u201d \n \n Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of NHL in adults. NHLs are cancers that begin in certain cells of the immune system and can be either fast-growing (aggressive) or slow-growing. Approximately 72,000 new cases of NHL are diagnosed in the U.S. each year, and DLBCL represents approximately one in three newly diagnosed cases. Yescarta is approved for use in adult patients with large B-cell lymphoma after at least two other kinds of treatment failed, including DLBCL, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, high grade B-cell lymphoma and DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma. Yescarta is not indicated for the treatment of patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma. \n \n Each dose of Yescarta is a customized treatment created using a patient\u2019s own immune system to help fight the lymphoma. The patient\u2019s T-cells, a type of white blood cell, are collected and genetically modified to include a new gene that targets and kills the lymphoma cells. Once the cells are modified, they are infused back into the patient. \n \n \u201cThe approval of Yescarta brings this innovative class of CAR-T cell therapies to an additional group of cancer patients with few other options \u2013 those adults with certain types of lymphoma that have not responded to previous treatments,\u201d said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). \n \n The safety and efficacy of Yescarta were established in a multicenter clinical trial of more than 100 adults with refractory or relapsed large B-cell lymphoma. The complete remission rate after treatment with Yescarta was 51 percent. \n \n Treatment with Yescarta has the potential to cause severe side effects. It carries a boxed warning for cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which is a systemic response to the activation and proliferation of CAR-T cells causing high fever and flu-like symptoms, and for neurologic toxicities. Both CRS and neurologic toxicities can be fatal or life-threatening. Other side effects include serious infections, low blood cell counts and a weakened immune system. Side effects from treatment with Yescarta usually appear within the first one to two weeks, but some side effects may occur later. \n \n Because of the risk of CRS and neurologic toxicities, Yescarta is being approved with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS), which includes elements to assure safe use (ETASU). The FDA is requiring that hospitals and their associated clinics that dispense Yescarta be specially certified. As part of that certification, staff involved in the prescribing, dispensing or administering of Yescarta are required to be trained to recognize and manage CRS and nervous system toxicities. Also, patients must be informed of the potential serious side effects and of the importance of promptly returning to the treatment site if side effects develop. \n \n To further evaluate the long-term safety, the FDA is also requiring the manufacturer to conduct a post-marketing observational study involving patients treated with Yescarta. \n \n The FDA granted Yescarta Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designations. Yescarta also received Orphan Drug designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases. The Yescarta application was reviewed using a coordinated, cross-agency approach. The clinical review was conducted by the FDA's Oncology Center of Excellence, while CBER conducted all other aspects of review and made the final product approval determination. \n \n The FDA granted approval of Yescarta to Kite Pharma, Inc. \n \n The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines, and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation\u2019s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products. \n \n ### ||||| In 2010, Josh Feldman was on his honeymoon -- a globe-spanning trip that at one point involved swimming with humpback whales -- when he noticed a \"Garbanzo-sized\" lump on the back of his neck. It turned out to be lymphoma, which worsened even as he cycled through treatments: chemotherapy, the immunotherapy Opdivo, a targeted drug called Zydelig. What actually worked for the 55-year-old photographer was a radical treatment in which his own white blood cells were genetically re-engineered to kill his cancer. Compared to the other drugs, it was \"a walk in the park,\" he said earlier this year while overlooking a mango tree on his property. \"I'd like to see it become first-line therapy,\" he said. In September, 15 months after his treatment, he was still in remission. \n \n That's still a long way away. But the treatment Feldman received was just approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the brand name Yescarta, with a bracing price tag: $373,000 per patient. That doesn't include the costs of dealing Yescarta's side effects, which include life-threatening fevers triggered by the immune response the therapy creates that can mean weeks in the hospital, or other drugs patients must receive. \n \n FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, himself a cancer survivor, called Yescarta \"another milestone in the development of a whole new scientific paradigm.\" David Maloney, a physician at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, had this to say about Yescarta's approval in a prepared statement: \"There will likely be thousands of lives saved in the next few years because of it.\" Louis DeGennaro, the chief executive of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, which helped fund Yescarta's development, wrote in an email blast that \"many patients who were out of treatment options are now in remission\" because of experimental studies of the drug. \n \n It's no surprise that the excitement comes at a high economic price. In August, the treatment's developer, Kite Pharmaceuticals, was purchased by biotech giant Gilead Pharmaceuticals for $11.9 billion, a price which made Kite founder and chief executive Arie Belldegrun's shares worth some $600 million. The process of making the drug is laborious and expensive. But critics are likely to counter that much of the work of developing the drug was done by the National Cancer Institute, by Steven Rosenberg, a researcher there. \n \n Yescarta is the second treatment of its kind, called a Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell, or CAR-T, for the particular genetic modifications made to white cells. The first, Kymriah, for Novartis, was addressed at children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a small group of patients. Yescarta is being approved for a much larger population. About 24,000 Americans are diagnosed with diffuse large-cell b-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the variety Yescarta treats, every year. \n \n Novartis priced Kymriah at $475,000, which makes Kite's price sound significantly lower. But Novartis said it is offering insurance companies a unique, \"value-based\" pricing structure, in which it only pays for those patients who go into remission withing three months. For Novartis' treatment in DLBCL, that's only 45% of patients, which means at the $475,000 price, Novartis would only be receiving about $200,000 per patient. (Novartis has not said how it will price in DLBCL). \n \n In patients' whose disease did not shrink after chemotherapy, Yescarta shrank tumors 70% of the time. More impressively, 51% went into complete remission, meaning their cancer was undetectable. The severe fever and neurological side effects led the FDA to give the treatment a boxed warning, its most severe. \n \n Kite also boasts about its ability to manufacture individual CAR-T cells for each patient. \"Our manufacturing success rate was 99% and the turnaround had a median of 17 days,\" said David Chang, Kite's chief scientific officer. \"I haven\u2019t anything close to that coming from Novartis.\" \n \n In an interview conducted before the approval, Chang also had a response for critics who point to the role that the NCI and the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society had in developing Yescarta as an argument that it should cost less. He says that people don't have enough appreciation of the difficult of moving from government-sponsored research to an approved, manufactured product. \n \n \"Look,\" Chang said, \"Government is not in the business of making and commercializing a drug. They are more in the business of creating the innovation. And innovation has to be matched with the right private company to make sure all the right necessary steps are done. This is the underlying premise of how the credo is set. Both for the government the private sector and ultimately for the patients.\" \n \n Chang says Kite (now Gilead) is developing CAR-T treatments for other cancers. It will test a CAR-T against a target called BCMA in multiple myeloma, another targeted against cancers caused by the human papilloma virus, and a third against MAGE3, hoping to to move the technology beyond cancers of the blood. \"The clinical results are really, really different from anything else that proceeded that before,\" Chang said.",

The new \"CAR T-cell therapy\" has been approved for non-Hodkins lymphoma patients with few other treatment options, a group that could number around 3,500 per year, the Washington Post reports. But the innovative therapy won't come cheap: Forbes reports that the cost will be $373,000 per patient, not including the cost of treating side effects that could include dangerous fevers. A similar treatment approved for leukemia in July costs $475,000 per patient. Doctors believe the new treatment, produced by Kite Pharma under the brand name Yescarta, could save thousands of lives, the New York Times reports.

    "document": "A Nasa spacecraft that will hurtle past Pluto on Tuesday at more than 45,000 kilometres per hour has revealed the dwarf planet to be larger than scientists thought. \n \n Fresh measurements from New Horizons, the first spacecraft to reach Pluto on the outer edge of the solar system, show that it is 2,370 kilometres across, roughly two-thirds the size of Earth\u2019s moon. \n \n \n \n Alan Stern, the lead scientist on the $700m (\u00a3450m) mission, said the increased dimensions meant Pluto must hold more ice and less rock beneath its surface than researchers had expected. Pluto has been hard to measure with any accuracy from Earth because it is so far away, and its atmosphere creates mirages that can fool ground-based telescopes. \n \n Other instruments onboard New Horizons confirmed that Pluto\u2019s north pole bears an icy cap. The latest measurements beamed to Earth from the probe picked up chemical signatures of methane and nitrogen ice in the polar cap. \n \n \n \n One early image received from New Horizons last week showed Pluto as an orangey globe bearing a large bright spot shaped like a heart. More recent images have revealed cliffs, craters and chasms larger than the Grand Canyon. \n \n \u201cThe science we\u2019ve already made is mouth-watering,\u201d said Stern. \u201cThe Pluto system is enchanting in its strangeness and its alien beauty.\u201d \n \n \n \n New Horizons will perform its historic flyby at 12.49pm BST on Tuesday. But scientists must wait until 2am BST on Wednesday for the probe to make contact with Earth and confirm it has survived the encounter. \n \n The most dangerous hazards for New Horizons are dust particles trapped in orbit around Pluto after being dislodged from its moons by meteorite impacts. A strike from a dust particle the size of a grain of rice could destroy the spacecraft, but the risk of such a disaster is low, at around one in 10,000. \n \n \n \n The New Horizons spacecraft has spent more than nine years on its 4.8bn kilometre journey to Pluto, the last world in the solar system to be visited by a spacecraft. On board are seven sophisticated instruments and the ashes of Clyde Tombaugh, the astronomer who discovered Pluto in 1930. \n \n \n \n Sorry, your browser is unable to play this video. Facebook Twitter Pinterest \n \n When the probe blasted off in January 2006, Pluto was the ninth planet in the solar system. Seven months later, astronomers at the International Astronomical Union voted to downgrade the icy body to a dwarf planet, because it does not dominate its region of space in the way the other major planets do. \n \n \n \n The spacecraft will take scores of photographs as it speeds past Pluto and its five known moons, Charon, Hydra, Nix, STyx and Kerberos. The images will give the first close-up view of the mountains and valleys of the unknown world, and its tenuous atmosphere seen as the sun rises and sets behind it. Instruments on New Horizons might even find evidence that it snows on the tiny world. \n \n \n \n Nasa officials expect the first images from the flyby to be released on Wednesday night. The snapshots from onboard cameras will capture details up to 100 metres across, a vast improvement on those taken on approach, which pick out features about 15 kilometres across. \n \n But scientists are in for a long wait to learn everything New Horizons sees. The probe will collect so much information as it passes Pluto that it will take 16 months to send it all back to Earth. \n \n \n \n The mission marks the end of the US space agency\u2019s bid to explore every planet in the solar system, starting with Venus in 1962. Tuesday\u2019s flyby coincides with the 50th anniversary of the first ever fly-by of Mars by the Mariner 4 probe. ||||| An illustration of the New Horizons spacecraft as it approaches Pluto and its largest moon, Charon. \n \n Nine and a half years after it launched into space, a NASA probe is set to become the first spacecraft to fly by the dwarf planet Pluto. The New Horizons spacecraft is expected to make its closest approach tomorrow (July 14) at 7:49 a.m. EDT (1149 GMT), coming within 7,800 miles (12,500 kilometers) of Pluto's surface. But even 4.67 billion miles (7.5 billion km) away, the historic mission could help scientists learn more about planet Earth. This is because studying other objects in the solar system can provide clues about Earth's history. Here are five things researchers can learn about Earth by studying the dwarf planet Pluto. \n \n How Earth formed \n \n Earth and the other planets in this solar system were likely born after a bunch of smaller objects smashed into each other. In fact, early in Earth's history, a Mars-sized object nearly annihilated the planet, according to NASA.The resulting pieces of debris eventually coalesced into the moon we see today. [Photo Timeline: How the Earth Formed] \n \n Artist's impression of a planetary system being formed. Credit: NASA \n \n Roughly 4 billion years ago, the inner solar system was a billiard zone, partly because Jupiter's strong gravity served as a slingshot that sent asteroids and comets hurtling toward the sun. In the region of space where Pluto is found, called the Kuiper Belt, icy and rocky objects had a relatively tranquil environment. This means that observing Pluto (and similar objects in the Kuiper Belt) offers hints about what the solar system looked like early in its history. \n \n Where Earth's water came from \n \n Last year, scientists discovered that water from comets may not have seeded Earth with life-building molecules, as had previously been thought. Observations from the European Rosetta spacecraft showed a different type of water on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The molecules of water (specifically, the deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio) were different from the molecules found on Earth, according to a study published in the journal Science in December 2014. \n \n There are many objects in the solar system that are icy, including moons, dwarf planets and even parts of the planet Mars. It's possible that there is ice on Pluto as well, scientists have said. Examining the ice on the dwarf planet could help researchers refine theories about how water spread through the solar system. \n \n How life began on Earth \n \n Life on Earth is full of carbon. This is why the potential discovery of organics (carbon-based molecules) in other parts of the solar system is such an exciting prospect. While not every organic chemical originated from something living, they are considered the building blocks of life. \n \n Are there organics even on icy, hostile Pluto? There are some reasons to think there may be, given that organics have been found in similarly life-unfriendly environments such as Mercury and Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Finding organic material \u2014 or even not finding them \u2014 could give scientists a better idea of how life first arose on Earth. \n \n Earth's atmospheric structure \n \n Earth's atmosphere, as seen from high above the surface. Credit: NASA \n \n Pluto has something of a bizarre atmosphere. The dwarf planet's gravity is so low that its tenuous atmosphere extends much higher than Earth's atmosphere does. Some scientists think the dwarf planet's atmosphere collapses onto the surface when Pluto is colder. Because Pluto's orbit is taking it closer to the sun right now, gases in the atmosphere are heating up and expanding. [5 Strange Facts About Pluto] \n \n By studying the atmospheres of other worlds, astronomers can learn more about how these same processes work on Earth. For example, Venus has a hothouse surface driven by a runaway greenhouse effect. Measurements of Venus' superhot, hellish atmosphere have helped scientists better understand global warming on Earth. \n \n How the sun affects Earth \n \n Life on Earth wouldn't survive for long without the sun. Most of the heat on Earth comes from its closest stellar neighbor. The sun even has effects high in the atmosphere, such as when solar flares belch gas (called coronal mass ejections) toward Earth and \"excite\" molecules in its atmosphere, causing stunning auroras (also known as the northern and southern lights). \n \n While auroras are benign, the sun's radiation can also zap power lines or satellites during so-called geomagnetic storms. Scientists are interested in seeing how the sun interacts with atmospheres throughout the solar system, including at Pluto. These observations will help researchers better predict the effects of intense solar activity, ranging from what happens after a solar flare to how the sun affects Earth's climate. \n \n Follow Live Science @livescience, Facebook & Google+.

Right now, we're just standing under the waterfall and enjoying it,\" New Horizons' principal investigator, Alan Stern, told BBC News. \n \n Just getting the probe in position to make the flyby has been a monumental feat. \n \n Because the observations are all run on an automated command sequence, New Horizons must fly a perfect path past Pluto, and with perfect timing - otherwise its cameras will shoot empty sky where the dwarf or its moons are expected to be. \n \n This has necessitated aiming New Horizons at a \"keyhole\" in space just 100km by 150km (60miles by 90 miles), and arriving at that location within a set margin of 100 seconds. \n \n All this has been achieved after a multi-billion-km flight across the Solar System lasting nine and a half years. \n \n The mission team will not celebrate until New Horizons contacts Earth again, which should happen at 00:53 GMT Wednesday (01:53 BST). \n \n This communication will contain only engineering information on the status of the probe, but controllers should be able to tell very quickly whether the flyby sequence worked properly or not. \n \n The first high-resolution pictures from the pass should be downlinked later on Wednesday. \n \n There is a very small possibility that New Horizons could be lost as it flies through the Pluto system. \n \n Any stray icy debris would be lethal if it collides with the spacecraft at its 14km/s velocity (31,000mph). \n \n As an insurance policy, the mission team therefore downlinked one last set of data from all seven of the probe's instruments on Monday. \n \n This included a final full-frame picture of Pluto before the approaching dwarf filled the entire field of view. This image is expected to be released by Nasa on its website at the moment of closest approach on Tuesday. \n \n Media caption Prof Alan Stern says Pluto is \"a little larger than anticipated\" \n \n On Monday, the New Horizons team announced a new, more precise measurement of Pluto's diameter at 2,370km.

(AP) \u2014 NASA's New Horizons spacecraft was expected to get up-close and personal with Pluto on Tuesday, on track to zoom within 7,800 miles of the small icy world left unexplored until now. \n \n This July 11, 2015, image provided by NASA shows Pluto from the New Horizons spacecraft. On Tuesday, July 14, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft will come closest to Pluto. New Horizons has traveled 3 billion... (Associated Press) \n \n It's the final destination on NASA's planetary tour of the solar system, which began more than a half-century ago. Pluto was still a full-fledged planet when New Horizons rocketed away in 2006, only to become demoted to dwarf status later that year. \n \n The 3 billion-mile journey from Cape Canaveral, Florida, culminates Tuesday at 7:49 a.m. EDT. That's when the spacecraft is due to fly past Pluto at 31,000 mph. \n \n The New Horizons team gathered at Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, won't know for many hours if everything went well. The spacecraft will be too busy taking photographs and collecting information to \"phone home.\" A confirmation signal is expected at around 9 p.m. EDT. \n \n New Horizons has already beamed back the best-ever images of Pluto and big moon Charon. Pluto also has four little moons. \n \n \"The Pluto system is enchanting in its strangeness, its alien beauty,\" principal scientist Alan Stern told reporters Monday. \n \n Discovered in 1930, Pluto is the largest object in the so-called Kuiper Belt, considered the third zone of the solar system after the inner rocky planets and outer gaseous ones. This unknown territory is a shooting gallery of comets and other small bodies. \n \n An extension of the $720 million mission, not yet approved, could have New Horizons flying past another much smaller Kuiper Belt object, before departing the solar system. \n \n ___ \n \n Online: \n \n NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/main/ \n \n Johns Hopkins University: http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/ ||||| Ahead of Tuesday's historic flyby, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft has already delivered data that 'is a gift for the ages.' Among the discoveries: Pluto is bigger than previously thought. \n \n Will Macy's become the next store to drop the Ivanka Trump brand? \n \n On the eve of NASA's historic flyby of Pluto, scientists and tourists at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona are excited about the images and discoveries the New Horizons' spacecraft will beam back to Earth. \n \n NASA's New Horizons mission to the Pluto-Charon system has yet to mark its finest hours \u2013 a historic flyby that makes its closest approach to the binary planet and its moons Tuesday morning. \n \n But even as the spacecraft puts the wraps on its final approach, data New Horizons has delivered within the past 48 hours \"is a gift for the ages,\" says Alan Stern, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., and the mission's principal investigator. \n \n The craft's approach is revealing \"tremendous diversity between the two planets in the system and their moons,\" he said. \"We're already seeing complex and nuanced surfaces that tell us of history for these two bodies that is probably beyond our wildest dreams.\" \n \n In short, \"the Pluto system is enchanting in its strangeness and alien beauty,\" Dr. Stern said during a briefing Monday. \n \n How alien? \n \n It's as though \"we're on the bridge of the Enterprise approaching some alien planet around Alpha Centauri 3 or whatever it is,\" said Paul Schenk, a planetary geologist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston and a member of the New Horizons science team. \"It's like someone painted it for a 'Star Trek' episode.\" \n \n Even seemingly mundane measurements, such as a new, more-accurate determination of Pluto's size \u2013 now pegged at 1,473 miles across, at the high end of estimates that have ranged from 1,429 miles to around 1,491 miles \u2013 carry import. \n \n The new size, combined with long-established, precise measurements of Pluto's mass, yields a dwarf planet a bit less dense than previously estimated. That means its interior contains more ice, versus rock, than previously estimated. This change has implications \u2013 yet to be worked out \u2013 for the process that formed the binary-planet system as well as for the chemistry of the disk of dust, gas, and ice that encircled the sun and provided the building blocks for the planets ad their moons, Stern explained. \n \n Bragging rights also come into play. \n \n \"The new measurement unambiguously settles the debate about the largest object in the Kuiper Belt,\" Stern said, referring to a region of the solar system extending more than 2 billion miles beyond Neptune. By some estimates, the region hosts trillions of comets as well as several hundred thousand objects larger than 60 miles across. It's also the region that gave birth to Pluto and the object that would collide with it to form Charon. Another Kuiper Belt inhabitant, Eris, had previously laid claim to the \"largest\" label at 1,445 miles across. \n \n A larger Pluto also means that the lower layer of the atmosphere is shallower than previously thought, which will affect models that try to shed light on the atmosphere's structure and behavior. \n \n Another early result involves nitrogen escaping from Pluto's tenuous atmosphere. New Horizons' instruments began to pick up the great escape five days ago, when the craft supposedly was too far away to see it, Stern said. It could mean that the nitrogen is fleeing the planet at a higher rate than models have suggested or that the mechanism responsible for triggering the loss is different than researchers have anticipated. \n \n In addition, incoming data show that a hypothesized polar cap on Pluto is in fact an ice cap consisting of nitrogen and methane ices. \n \n New Horizons also is revealing features on Pluto that are generating speculation, pending more detail from measurements taken at the closest approach. \n \n For instance, images of Pluto released over the weekend show a surface that in many places hosted vast expanses of small, tightly packed dimple-like formations. \n \n The features appear to be similar to those on Neptune's moon Triton, Dr. Schenk said. Triton \u2013 itself thought to be a Kuiper Belt object that Neptune captured \u2013 hosts a surface \"that looks like a boiling pot of porridge, with cells of material popping up. They create a cellular pattern that looks like the skin of a cantaloupe.\" \n \n There, researchers suspect that relatively buoyant rock or ice has risen from deeper in the crust to build the array of hills and depressions \u2013 similar in principle to salt domes that rise through surrounding rock to form low hills in southern Louisiana or southeastern Texas. \n \n The science team hopes to get a closer look at some of these dimpled regions in images New Horizons takes during its closest approach Tuesday morning. \n \n In addition, images so far show a relatively smooth surface over much of Pluto, suggesting that the surface could be relatively young, Schenk said. \n \n Again, he cites Triton as a possible analog. The relative smoothness of much of Triton's surface suggests that it's less than 100 million years old. \"On Triton, everything is very young,\" Schenk said. \n \n It speaks to Triton as a captured Kuiper Belt object whose orbit around Neptune initially would have been elliptical, but over time became circular. The change in orbit would have heated Triton significantly, allowing fresh material to well up from depth and repave the surface, erasing any evidence of impact craters that would have accumulated over time. \n \n On Pluto, \"we're not seeing any large craters that would pop out and say: There's a big basin here,\" he says. \"So we're beginning to think that maybe that it's a very young surface.\" \n \n The source of internal heating required to provide material for repaving Pluto is unclear, Schenk acknowledges. Perhaps heat left over from the impact that formed Charon remained intense enough long enough to provide sources of fresh material for resurfacing Pluto. \n \n \"We still don't know,\" he says. \"But we'll find that out.\" \n \n [Correction: This article has been updated to correct the new measurements of Pluto's diameter.] ||||| Pluto is pictured from a million miles away in this July 11, 2015 handout image from New Horizons' Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI). \n \n SYDNEY A space tracking station surrounded by cows in an Australian valley will on Tuesday become the first place in the world to get close-up images of Pluto, the most distant planetary body ever explored. \n \n After nine-and-half years of traveling 5.3 billion km (3.3 billion miles), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s spacecraft New Horizons will get within 12,500 km (7,800 miles) of Pluto on Tuesday evening. \n \n The spacecraft has been sent specifically to take pictures of Pluto, a part of the solar system that has been in deep freeze for billions of years. The data will be relayed back to the tracking station at Canberra's Deep Space Communication Complex (CDSCC). \n \n \"It's very exciting because we have never ever visited Pluto, either by robots or man missions because it is so far away,\" CDSCC Director Ed Kruzins told Reuters. \n \n Up to now, little has been known about Pluto, the most distant planetary body in the solar system and the last to be explored by NASA. \n \n It was downgraded from a planet to a dwarf planet in 2006 and is thought to contain important clues about the origins of the solar system. \n \n \"There's a feeling among scientists that Pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it's now locked in deep freeze and maybe it will tell us what we once were, a long time ago,\" Kruzins said. \n \n New Horizons, the fastest spacecraft ever launched, is due to send a message that will be received by the Australian tracking station on Wednesday - a key message that will determine if the mission has been a success. \n \n Each piece of data will then take about four-and-half hours to transmit, with the full dataset taking about 15 months to complete. \n \n New Horizons will travel at 58,000 km (36,039 miles) per hour past Pluto, Kruzins said, which could pose a problem if there is any space debris. \n \n \"Even a grain of sand would cause significant damage to the vehicle, it would be like being hit by a brick at 70 kilometers per hour,\" Kruzins said. \n \n The tracking station, 35 km (20 miles) from the capital of Canberra, is part of NASA's Deep Space network and is one of only three tracking stations in the world. \n \n New Horizons will be at its closest to Pluto for about 24 hours before continuing on its journey to the outer solar system. \n \n (Editing by Robert Birsel) ||||| NASA\u2019s New Horizons spacecraft will fly within 8,000 miles of Pluto on Tuesday and reveal the last world in the solar system\u2014or at least the last of the planets that most of us learned about in school. Until now, Pluto\u2019s face has remained hidden because it's so far away. To really see it as more than a blurry blob, we needed to go there. (Learn more about the historic mission to Pluto on the National Geographic Channel.) \n \n But getting to the icy world is no easy feat. By the time New Horizons reaches Pluto at 7:50 a.m. EDT Tuesday, it will have traveled roughly 3 billion miles for a single, fleeting chance to fly past the dwarf planet. \n \n Launched in 2006, New Horizons is the fastest spacecraft to ever leave Earth. It crossed the orbit of Jupiter the next year and has been traveling nearly a million miles a day \u2014but it still took 9.5 years for the spacecraft to reach Pluto and its moons. \n \n View Images On Saturday, New Horizons got one of its last looks at this side of Pluto, which faces its moon Charon. Captured from a distance of 2.5 million miles from Pluto, the photo shows mysterious geometric features above the equator, along with sinewy dark splotches. Photograph by NASA/JHUAPL/SWRI \n \n In fact, New Horizons is going so fast\u2014more than 30,000 miles per hour\u2014that the spacecraft will pass by Pluto in just three minutes. \n \n The entire close encounter lasts for hours, though, with New Horizons making hundreds of observations of Pluto and its five bizarre moons . The first of the highest-resolution images will be released Wednesday afternoon, and the rest of the data will trickle in over the next 16 months. \n \n While waiting for the flyby at New Horizons mission headquarters, space writer Nadia Drake answers some of the biggest questions about Tuesday's event. \n \n 1. Why a flyby? Why not slow down or orbit Pluto? \n \n Simply put, slowing down and orbiting Pluto is nearly impossible if you want to get there in a reasonable amount of time. The planet\u2019s gravity is so weak that a spacecraft pulling into orbit would need to be going really slowly. For New Horizons to slow down enough, it would have to carry enough fuel to fire its brakes and reverse all its forward momentum\u2014that\u2019s about as much fuel as was used to launch the spacecraft and get it zooming along in the first place. Launching all that propellent, plus the spacecraft, is pretty much impossible . (Read about chasing Pluto's shadow ). \n \n WATCH: NASA's New Horizons spacecraft will fly by Pluto on July 14, after traveling three billion miles from Earth in roughly 9.5 years. Video by Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory \n \n 2. We see amazing shots of faraway galaxies, so why haven't we ever gotten a good picture of Pluto? \n \n Though they\u2019re far away, those distant, glittering galaxies are really big and bright, which is why telescopes like Hubble can see them. But Pluto is too small and dim for even our sharpest Earth-based eyes to get a good look at: It's only about two-thirds as wide as Earth\u2019s moon. Even dwarf planet Ceres, which lives much closer to Earth, is too small to be anything but a blurry blob in Hubble pictures. (Learn more about Pluto's first close-up ). \n \n 3. What's the biggest thing that could go wrong? \n \n It could be disastrous for the spacecraft to run into a dust particle as it flies through the Pluto system. Because the spacecraft is going so fast, colliding with something the size of a rice pellet could be catastrophic. So, the team has spent the last few weeks intensively surveying the system for anything that might be shedding dust and debris in the spacecraft\u2019s path, and so far have found nothing to be concerned about. (Learn what happened when the spacecraft went silent ). \n \n 4. What will the pictures of Pluto look like? \n \n The images coming back from New Horizons are already by far the best ever taken of the dwarf planet, even though the latest image, on July 12, was taken from about a million miles away. Tuesday\u2019s encounter will produce close-up, detailed images of Pluto and Charon, plus some images of the smaller moons. (Also see \" Three Possible Plutos \"). \n \n On the side of Pluto that the spacecraft will be able to see, features as small as the lakes in New York City\u2019s Central Park will be visible. But that\u2019s not all: After New Horizons zooms by Pluto, it will swivel around and take a look at the planet\u2019s south pole, which we haven\u2019t seen yet. (Check out the weirdest feature I'd like to see on Pluto ). Facing away from the sun, that pole is in the dark, except for the soft glow of sunlight reflected off Charon. In other words, New Horizons will give us a glimpse of Pluto\u2019s wintry pole, in Charon's moonlight. (Also see: \" Proposed Names for Pluto System's Features Include Kirk and Spock \"). \n \n 5. How long does it take to send a photo of Pluto to Earth? \n \n Radio signals traveling at the speed of light take 4.5 hours to travel between Pluto and Earth. So, data received from New Horizons will have been on the road for about as long as it takes to drive between San Francisco and Santa Barbara. Because of that, it will take about 16 months for all of New Horizons\u2019 flyby data to make it to Earth\u2014meaning that new discoveries will be trickling in through the end of 2016. (See the first color image of Pluto from New Horizons ). \n \n View Images The New Horizons spacecraft, illustrated here flying past Pluto, traveled about 3 billion miles to visit the dwarf planet and its five known moons. Illustration by Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Southwest Research Institute (JHUAPL/SwRI) \n \n 6. What are we going to learn about Pluto? \n \n New Horizons will take a good, detailed look at Pluto and its large moon Charon (in fact, Charon is so large it forms a binary system with Pluto). Scientists are curious about Pluto\u2019s terrains and composition, whether there\u2019s evidence for geologic activity, and what the planet\u2019s thin, nitrogen atmosphere is doing. They\u2019ll also be looking for clues to how the Pluto system formed and evolved\u2014and many of those clues might lie in the features of the four small moons Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx . (Check out Pluto's possible polar cap ). \n \n 7. What will New Horizons do after it passes Pluto? How long can it keep going? \n \n After New Horizons passes Pluto, it will continue sailing on into the Kuiper Belt, which is a vast, icy debris ring outside the orbit of Neptune. If NASA approves it, New Horizons will sail past and study another icy world within the next five years. The spacecraft carries enough fuel for that encounter (it\u2019ll use the propellent to adjust its course), and will still be able to send data back to Earth, even though that body is nearly a billion miles farther out. Ultimately, it will continue heading out of the solar system, much as NASA\u2019s Voyager I and II spacecraft are doing. (Learn more about New Horizon's Mission ). \n \n 8. Is this our only chance, or will any other spacecraft be going to Pluto? \n \n There are no plans at this point to send another spacecraft to Pluto, but it sure would be nice to learn even more about that enigmatic little world and its cousins on the fringe of the observable solar system. \n \n 9. Is it carrying a message for aliens? \n \n Not yet. There is a project, called the One Earth Message, that aims to upload a digital message to the spacecraft once it\u2019s done collecting data and sending it all to Earth. That could be years from now, if New Horizons flies by another body in the Kuiper Belt. The message would be something like a new version of the Voyager Golden Record , which carried the sights and sounds of Planet Earth into the cosmos aboard the Voyager I and II spacecraft. \n \n 10. What did New Horizons do during the nine years it took to get to Pluto? \n \n It spent a lot of that time hibernating, but did occasionally wake up for system tests. And, of course, it woke up to take a look at Jupiter as it flew by the giant planet in 2007. No sense missing out on that view! Later, when it crossed Neptune\u2019s orbit in 2014, New Horizons woke up again to snap a picture of the icy blue giant\u2014but Neptune was so far away it looked like a faint dot.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 This is one of the biggest days in the exploration of our solar system since Voyager 2 approached Neptune in 1989\u2014and there may not be a day like it again. According to NASA's calculations, its New Horizons spacecraft flew by Pluto at 31,000mph at 7:49am EDT today; confirmation of that will come tonight, some 13 hours later, reports the AP. The confirmation will mark the completion of NASA's tour of the \"classical nine\" planets, reports the AP, which notes that Pluto was considered a full-fledged planet instead of a dwarf one when the probe began its journey in 2006. Some things to know about the historic flyby, which comes 50 years to the day after the first successful flyby of Mars: New Horizons will have to capture a vast amount of data in a short time. The probe will be pushed to its limits as it pivots to capture photos and information on Pluto and its moons Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra during the flyby. \"I can't wait to get into the data and really start making sense of it. Right now, we're just standing under the waterfall and enjoying it,\" principal New Horizons scientist Alan Stern tells the BBC. We don't know whether it was a success. The probe is far too busy to \"phone home,\" the AP notes, but it's expected to send a confirmation signal at around 9pm tonight. The eagerly awaited first photos from the flyby should be released tomorrow night, the Guardian reports, though it will take 16 months to send all the data from the flyby back to Earth. We've already learned a lot of new things about Pluto. \"The science we've already made is mouth-watering,\" says Stern. \"The Pluto system is enchanting in its strangeness and its alien beauty.\" Among NASA's findings in recent days: Pluto's North Pole has an icy cap and the planet's diameter is 1,597 miles across, not 1,471 miles as previously thought. The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time. LiveScience notes that new information from Pluto could help explain how our own planet formed and how life began. \"There's a feeling among scientists that Pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it's now locked in deep freeze and maybe it will tell us what we once were, a long time ago,\" the director of the Deep Space Communication Complex tells Reuters. The Australian facility will be first to receive new information from the spacecraft. New Horizons isn't done. New Horizons will keep traveling into the Kuiper Belt debris field and beyond after it passes Pluto, National Geographic notes, and it may have more research to do if NASA approves funding.

    "document": "Voters in Tuesday's Florida Republican primary chose Mitt Romney as the candidate best able to beat President Barack Obama in the fall, preferring electability over ideology in lifting the former Massachusetts governor to a broad victory despite concerns that his issue positions are not conservative enough. \n \n ROMNEY RECAPTURES ELECTABILTY: A majority of Florida GOP voters said Romney is the candidate best able to beat Obama in a general election matchup; only about 3 in 10 said the same of Newt Gingrich. And Romney carried 6 in 10 votes among those seeking a candidate who could defeat the president in November. Gingrich had a strong showing among those seeking a true conservative and split the vote with Romney among those seeking an experienced candidate. \n \n CONSERVATIVES THEN AND NOW: In 2008, Romney carried the mantle of conservative alternative to eventual Republican nominee John McCain. This time around, about 4 in 10 Florida voters said Romney's issue positions are not conservative enough, and very conservative voters were more apt to back Gingrich than the former governor of Massachusetts. Strong supporters of the tea party movement also favored Gingrich over Romney, but Romney carried 50 percent or more among those who support the movement somewhat, are neutral or oppose it. \n \n THE GENDER GAP: Romney won by a wide margin among women after a deeply negative campaign in Florida raising questions about Gingrich's character. Women were more apt than men to say they were influenced by campaign advertising, and were a bit more likely to say a candidate's \"strong moral character\" was the most important factor in their vote. In the end, only about half of women in the poll report holding a positive opinion of Gingrich as a person, compared with nearly 8 in 10 who have a positive opinion of Romney. \n \n ECONOMIC CONCERNS TRUMP ALL: About 6 in 10 said the economy was their top issue in choosing a candidate, about half said foreclosures were having a major impact on their community, and 3 in 10 said they were falling behind financially. \n \n SEEKING OTHER CHOICES: Four in 10 voters said they would like to see someone else run for the nomination, more than said so in New Hampshire a few weeks ago, though the window for another candidate to join the field is nearly closed. About half of voters said they would be satisfied if Gingrich or Rick Santorum became the nominee. More, about two-thirds, said they'd be satisfied with a Romney candidacy, including about 4 in 10 who voted for Gingrich and half who backed Santorum. \n \n The survey of 2,739 Republican voters was conducted for The Associated Press and the television networks by Edison Research. This includes preliminary results among 2,139 voters interviewed Tuesday as they left their polling places at 40 randomly selected sites in Florida. In addition, 600 who voted early or absentee were interviewed by landline or cellular telephone from Jan. 23 to 29. The survey has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. ||||| Mitt Romney won a commanding victory in the Florida primary Tuesday night, rebounding from defeat a week earlier and taking a major step toward the Republican presidential nomination.

So far, he noted, he was in third place in delegates, adding \"that's what really counts, and we've only just gotten started.\" \n \n No candidate so far has more than 10% of the 1,144 delegates needed to win the nomination at the August convention. \n \n According to exit poll information, Romney led in most categories in Florida to show his appeal to Republican voters who said their main concern was choosing a candidate who can defeat Obama. \n \n Romney gained significant ground in the Latino community, carrying Hispanics by 23 points. In the 2008 Florida primary, Romney lost Hispanics to eventual GOP nominee Sen. John McCain by 40 points. \n \n In particular, Romney carried Cuban-Americans -- a vital constituency for Republicans in Florida against Obama -- by 24 points. \n \n He lost to Gingrich only among the most hardcore elements of the GOP base -- voters who described themselves as very conservative and evangelical or born-again. However, Romney ran strongly among women voters, getting 51% to 29% for Gingrich, indicating that Gingrich's history of three marriages, two divorces and infidelity might be harming him. \n \n Final polls closed at 8 p.m. ET and Romney jumped out to a strong early lead, buoyed by solid support among more than 632,000 voters who cast absentee or early ballots. His double-digit victory blunted any momentum Gingrich gained from his January 21 victory in South Carolina, the previous primary. \n \n Both Romney and Gingrich focused their speeches Tuesday night on the ultimate goal -- taking on Obama in November. \n \n Romney listed what he called the differing ideologies between himself and the president, promising to balance the budget without raising taxes and saying \"together we will build an America where hope is a new job with a paycheck, not a faded word on an old bumper sticker.\" \n \n \"The path I lay out is not one paved with ever increasing government checks and cradle-to-grave assurance government will always be the solution,\" Romney said. \"If this election is a bidding war for who can promise the most goodies and the most benefits, I'm not your president. You have that president today.\" \n \n Gingrich pledged to compete in every contest in the nomination process, and to repeal Obama policies hated by conservatives -- such as health care reform and Wall Street reform -- on his first day in office. \n \n \"This is the most important election of your lifetime,\" Gingrich said, adding: \"If Barack Obama gets re-elected, it will be a disaster for the United States of America.

Marco Rubio told CNN Tuesday . \"Florida is a mini America.\" \n \n GOP strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos said a Romney victory would not automatically end the Repubican nomination campaign. \n \n \"With a win, Romney puts the nomination firmly in his grip. But it appears Gingrich and Santorum will keep trying to rip it from his hand,\" said Castellanos, who was a Romney media adviser in 2008 but is not taking sides this year. \n \n Gingrich stormed into Florida 10 days earlier on a roll off of his double-digit victory over Romney and the rest of the field in the South Carolina primary. \n \n His momentum quickly faded after Romney's campaign went on the offensive, turning in two strong debate performances in the Sunshine State and unleashing a barrage of ads targeting Gingrich. \n \n Negative ads accounted for 92% of political ads airing in Florida over the last week -- a record rate for political campaigns , according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks advertising content and spending. \n \n \"I spent much of my academic career telling reporters, 'Relax, this is not the most negative campaign ever,' \" CMAG President Ken Goldstein said. \"Well, this IS the most negative campaign ever.\" \n \n Romney told reporters Tuesday that he had learned his lesson from his South Carolina loss. \n \n \"If you're attacked, I'm not going to just sit back,\" he told reporters in Tampa, repeating a refrain he's used regularly recently. \"I'm going to fight back and fight back hard.\" \n \n On the day before the primary, Gingrich accused Romney of dishonesty but conceded the wave of attack ads had been effective. \n \n \"Frankly if all that stuff were true I wouldn't vote for myself,\" Gingrich said in Jacksonville Monday , referring to what he called \"dishonest\" Romney ads. \n \n JUST WATCHED Who voted in the Florida primary?

It has been kind of painfully revealing to watch.\" \n \n While Romney and Gingrich were in Florida on Tuesday night to watch election returns, Santorum and Paul, knowing they're out of the running for the 50 delegates, have moved on to the next contests. \n \n Santorum campaigned in Colorado and Nevada on Tuesday, while Paul was in Maine over the weekend and was spending Tuesday in Colorado and Nevada. \n \n Nevada's caucuses take place Saturday, when Maine starts its week-long caucuses. \n \n Minnesota and Colorado hold their caucuses on February 7, the same day that Missouri holds its non-binding primary. \n \n In Lone Tree, Colorado, Santorum called on voters to consider questions that have arisen about the character and discipline of Gingrich, his main rival for support from conservatives. \n \n \"It's an issue of trust,\" Santorum said when a man at his Tuesday event challenged the character of Gingrich, who has been divorced twice and cited for a violation of House ethics rules. \n \n Personal mistakes don't automatically disqualify someone from seeking high office, Santorum said, noting Gingrich has sought forgiveness. \n \n \"I don't question his sincerity of his repentance, but as I have said many times there is two areas that are open for concern and that is -- the issue of trust and whether someone who has a record of that is someone you feel comfortable has truly changed and you forgive them,\" Santorum continued. \"That doesn't mean they necessarily have changed their ways.\" \n \n The Paul and Santorum campaigns are strategically looking to states in which they can pick up delegates. \n \n \"Ultimately they're conceding in advance in Florida, while trying to shore up future states,\" said Doug Heye, a GOP strategist and Republican National Committee communications director. \"Unfortunately for Paul and Santorum, that generally has not been a winning strategy. It's not being done out of a position of strength.\" \n \n Romney's convincing win in Florida, coupled with an unfriendly calendar for Gingrich in February with friendlier Super Tuesday states more than a month away, could put Gingrich in a bind. \n \n \"February doesn't look good for Newt Gingrich. He'll lose Nevada, with its large LDS (Mormon) population and lose Michigan (February 28), where Romney's father was governor. Newt will have a long march across the desert with no debates to revive his campaign,\" Castellanos said. \n \n \"Newt has to hold his breath all the way to Super Tuesday, March 6th, raise 30 or 40 million dollars for advertising and fix his problem with female voters to catch Romney. Those are grandiose problems, even for Gingrich.\" ||||| TAMPA, Fla. \u2014 Mitt Romney claimed a powerful victory in Florida\u2019s presidential primary, reasserting himself as the front-runner for his party\u2019s nomination and leaving Newt Gingrich reeling from a likely double-digit defeat and facing an uncertain path to regaining his post-South Carolina momentum. \n \n With 96 percent of precincts reporting, Romney led Gingrich by 16 percentage points, 47 percent to 32 percent. Rick Santorum was a distant third, with 13 percent, followed by Ron Paul with 7 percent. \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset Winners & Losers in 60 seconds Romney wins in Florida Gingrich after 2nd place finish \n \n In just 10 days, Romney went from limping out of South Carolina \u2014 where Gingrich beat him handily \u2014 to scoring an almost across-the-board win against the former House speaker with nearly every category of GOP primary voter. \n \n Addressing an energetic crowd of supporters here in Tampa, Romney acknowledged that the primary campaign was not over but predicted the GOP was on its way to victory in the fall. \n \n \u201cA competitive primary does not divide us. It prepares us. And we will win,\u201d Romney said. \u201cWhen we gather back here in Tampa seven months from now for our convention, ours will be a united party with a winning ticket for America.\u201d \n \n Said Romney: \u201cI stand ready to lead this party and to lead our nation.\u201d \n \n Romney\u2019s final victory margin may tighten as returns come in from Florida\u2019s conservative western Panhandle. But with a majority of votes reported, Romney appeared on the brink of an important symbolic accomplishment: winning more votes than Gingrich and Santorum \u2014 the two would-be anti-Romney conservatives \u2014 combined. \n \n That won\u2019t put to rest questions about Romney\u2019s ability to connect with and fire up the activist base of the Republican Party. It may, however, deprive his beleaguered opponents of a key argument they\u2019ve used to explain their persistence in the race. \n \n Romney won with both men and women and in every age and income group, according to network exit polls. He won a majority of white voters \u2014 53 percent \u2014 and 44 percent of Latinos. \n \n The only conspicuous bright spot for Gingrich was voters who described themselves as \u201cvery conservative,\u201d who made up 33 percent of the electorate and broke for Gingrich over Romney, 43 percent to 29 percent. \n \n In his own evening speech in Orlando, Gingrich insisted that Florida had only helped to reinforce the overarching narrative of the campaign. \n \n \u201cIt is now clear that this will be a two-person race between the conservative leader, Newt Gingrich, and the Massachusetts moderate,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cThe voters of Florida really made that clear.\u201d \n \n With supporters waving signs that read, \u201c46 States to Go,\u201d Gingrich vowed: \u201cWe are going to contest every place and we are going to win and we will be in Tampa as the nominee in August.\u201d \n \n Gingrich will be hard-pressed to keep up with Romney, financially and organizationally \u2014 a dynamic already in play in Florida. \n \n The dramatic scale of Romney\u2019s win is in some respects a tale of traditional campaign legwork and preparation paying off. The Bay Stater raised money faster and earlier, built an operation in Florida sooner, and worked aggressively to exploit the state\u2019s early and absentee voting laws.",

The economics prize, which is not technically a Nobel, will be announced Oct. 8. ||||| Image copyright Uni Waterloo Image caption Dr Strickland shared the prize for discoveries in laser physics \n \n The Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded to a woman for the first time in 55 years. \n \n Donna Strickland, from Canada, is only the third woman winner of the award, along with Marie Curie, who won in 1903, and Maria Goeppert-Mayer, who was awarded the prize in 1963. \n \n Dr Strickland shares this year's prize with Arthur Ashkin, from the US, and Gerard Mourou, from France. \n \n It recognises their discoveries in the field of laser physics. \n \n Dr Ashkin developed a laser technique described as optical tweezers, which is used to study biological systems. \n \n Drs Mourou and Strickland paved the way for the shortest and most intense laser pulses ever created. They developed a technique called Chirped Pulse Amplification (CPA). It has found uses in laser therapy targeting cancer and in the millions of corrective laser eye surgeries which are performed each year. \n \n Speaking to the BBC, Dr Strickland said it was \"surprising\" it had been such a long time since a woman had won the award. \n \n However, she stressed that she had \"always been treated as an equal\", and that \"two men also won it with me, and they deserve this prize as much if not more than me\". \n \n Image copyright Reuters Image caption Arthur Ashkin and Gerard Mourou were honoured for their contributions to the field \n \n The award comes a few days after a physicist gave a \"highly offensive\" lecture at the Cern particle physics laboratory in Geneva in which he said that physics had been \"built by men\" and that male scientists were being discriminated against. \n \n He has since been suspended by the research centre. \n \n Dr Strickland called the physicist's remarks \"silly\" and said she never took such comments \"personally\". \n \n The last woman to win the physics prize, German-born American physicist Maria Goeppert-Mayer, took the award for her discoveries about the nuclei of atoms. \n \n Polish-born physicist Marie Curie shared the 1903 award with her husband Pierre Curie and Antoine Henri Becquerel for their research into radioactivity. \n \n The award is worth a total of nine million Swedish kronor (\u00a3770,686; $998,618). \n \n Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre Curie \n \n Reacting to her win, Dr Strickland, who is based at the University of Waterloo in Canada, said: \"First of all you have to think it's crazy, so that was my first thought. And you do always wonder if it's real. \n \n \"As far as sharing it with Gerard, of course he was my supervisor and mentor and he has taken CPA to great heights so he definitely deserves this award. And I'm so happy Art Ashkin also won.\" \n \n She added: \"I think that he made so many discoveries early on that other people have done great things with that it's fantastic that he is finally recognised.\" \n \n In a statement, the American Institute of Physics (AIP) offered its congratulations to all the winners, adding: \"The countless applications made possible by their work, like laser eye surgery, high-power pettawat lasers, and the ability to trap and study individual viruses and bacteria, only promise to increase going forward. \n \n \"It is also a personal delight to see Dr Strickland break the 55-year hiatus since a woman has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, making this year's award all the more historic.\" \n \n Image copyright SPL Image caption Mourou and Strickland's technique has found several applications, including in laser eye surgery \n \n What is the work that has won a Nobel? \n \n Before Dr Strickland and Dr Mourou's pioneering work, the peak power of laser pulses was limited because, when cranked up to high intensities, they would destroy the material used for amplifying its energy. \n \n To get round this, the researchers first stretched the laser pulses in time to reduce their peak power, then amplified them and finally compressed them. \n \n When a laser pulse is compressed in time and becomes shorter, more light is packed into a small space. This dramatically increases the intensity of the pulse. \n \n Dr Strickland and Dr Mourou's technique, called chirped pulse amplification (CPA), became standard for high intensity lasers. \n \n Arthur Ashkin realised an old dream in science fiction - using the radiation pressure of light to move physical objects. In doing so, he invented the optical tweezers that are today used to grab particles, atoms, viruses and living cells with their laser-based pincers. \n \n He first worked on getting laser light to push small particles towards the centre of the beam and hold them there. \n \n Then, in 1987, he used the tweezers to capture living bacteria without harming them. The technique is now used widely to study the machinery of life. \n \n Follow Paul on Twitter. \n \n Previous winners of the Nobel Prize in Physics \n \n Image copyright S.Ossokine/A.Buonanno (MPI Gravitational Physics) Image caption A computer simulation of gravitational waves radiating from two merging black holes \n \n 2017 - Rainer Weiss, Kip Thorne and Barry Barish earned the award for the detection of gravitational waves. \n \n 2016 - David Thouless, Duncan Haldane and Michael Kosterlitz shared the award for their work on rare phases of matter. \n \n 2015 - Takaaki Kajita and Arthur McDonald were awarded the prize the discovery that neutrinos switch between different \"flavours\". \n \n 2014 - Isamu Akasaki, Hiroshi Amano and Shuji Nakamura won the physics Nobel for developing the first blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs). \n \n 2013 - Francois Englert and Peter Higgs shared the spoils for formulating the theory of the Higgs boson particle. \n \n 2012 - Serge Haroche and David J Wineland were awarded the prize for their work with light and matter. ||||| Tweet with a location \n \n You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

The Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences on Tuesday awarded half the $1.01 million prize to Arthur Ashkin of the United States, and the other half will be shared by Gerard Mourou of France and Donna Strickland of Canada, per the AP. Strickland is the third female laureate in physics, but the first in more than half a century, reports the BBC. The academy says Ashkin developed \"optical tweezers\" that can grab tiny particles such as viruses without damaging them. As the Guardian notes, \"this means scientists can hold even living cells in place, allowing them to probe their inner workings.\" Strickland and Mourou helped develop short and intense laser pulses that have broad industrial and medical applications. The Nobel panel's explanation: \"Ultra-sharp laser beams make it possible to cut or drill holes in various materials extremely precisely\u2014even in living matter. Millions of eye operations are performed every year with the sharpest of laser beams.\" (A CERN scientist just got suspended for saying physics was built by men.)",

Today we have been in contact with the NFLPA and will work together to gather more information from the club's medical staff and Mr. Brady. The health and safety of our players is our foremost priority and we want to ensure that all our players have and continue to receive the best care possible.\" \n \n According to David P. Woods of The Score, the Patriots have not listed Brady on the injury report with a concussion over the past four seasons. \n \n ESPN's Bomani Jones offered some perspective with regard to Gisele labeling whatever Brady was dealing with as a concussion: \n \n The 12-time Pro Bowler sat out the first four games of 2016 due to a suspension stemming from Deflategate before going on to post an 11-1 regular-season record and lead the Pats to a win over the Atlanta Falcons in the Super Bowl. \n \n Despite the concussion, Gisele told Rose that Brady's transition to a plant-based diet has made him feel better physically, per CBS News: \n \n The 39-year-old veteran showed no signs of slowing down last season, throwing for 3,554 yards, 28 touchdowns and just two interceptions during the regular season. \n \n Brady has not missed a game due to injury since 2008, when he was forced to sit out 15 contests after tearing his ACL and MCL in the season opener. ||||| She's been hailed as one of the great beauties of the world, but retired supermodel Gisele B\u00fcndchen is now hoping to turn the world's gaze from the dazzle of the catwalk to the condition of the planet. \n \n \"I believe we are spiritual beings having a human experience. And I believe that Planet Earth is, like, you know, it's a spaceship. Let's put it that way,\" B\u00fcndchen told \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Charlie Rose. \"In this spaceship, life is very fragile, in a way.\" \n \n \"This planet \u2013 I mean, look at it. Fruits grow on trees. You know, the Earth provide us food, rivers, all the animals, all the species. I mean, we are blessed! We are living in heaven here. I mean, come on,\" B\u00fcndchen added. \n \n \n \n Having stepped off the runway last year, B\u00fcndchen uses her global platform to advocate for the environment, exploring deforestation in the Amazon, working as a United Nations goodwill ambassador, and now addressing climate change with environmentalist Paul Hawken. She's helping promote his latest book, \"Drawdown.\" \n \n CBS News \n \n \n \n \n \n \"What is Drawdown?\" Rose asked. \n \n \n \n \"Drawdown is the first time when greenhouse gasses peak, and go down on a year-to-year basis,\" Hawken said. \n \n \n \n \"When will that happen?\" Rose asked. \n \n \n \n \"Well, we don't know. But the point we try to make in that book is that nobody's aiming for it,\" Hawken responded. \n \n Hawken's book lists 100 solutions to reverse global warming, all based on existing science and ranked by cost and carbon impact. It inspired B\u00fcndchen to take action. \n \n \n \n \"I saw, 'Oh my God,' someone is actually addressing solutions. Someone is focusing on the solutions here, instead of focusing on the problems\u2026 like, 'How can I help? How do I sign up to help?' And that's how I \u2013 that's how I'm here,\" she said. \n \n Asked why people haven't advocated for the environment more in recent years, Hawken said while \"the science is impeccable,\" the communication of the science \"has been miserable.\" \n \n \"Because it has focused on threat, on gloom, and the idea somehow that we'll get people to act if we scare the pee out of them actually hasn't worked at all,\" Hawken said. \n \n \n \n \"I hear you talking about the fact that you gotta have a plan, and you gotta be optimistic. And you gotta understand what you can do. But at the same time, I know lots of people who are saying that unless we do something immediately, it's gonna be catastrophic,\" Rose said. \n \n \n \n \"And I agree. And then what I'm saying is we're acting,\" Hawken said. \"This is in place. It is scaling. And if we continue to scale in a rigorous but reasonable way over 30 years, we can reverse global warming.\" \n \n \n \n For now, the two claim to be unfazed by the Trump administration's efforts to revive the coal industry and roll back environmental rules. B\u00fcndchen said she is concerned but called herself \"an optimist.\" \n \n \n \n \"So I believe\u2026 that what all of this noise is doing, I feel, is bringing more awareness,\" B\u00fcndchen said. \"And I think now people are just more kinda feeling like, you know, I have to take the matters to my own hands. Like, I have to get educated. I have to learn. I have to kind of figure out how are we gonna do this.\" \n \n \"But don't you think we should be a catalyst to try \u2013 if you disagree with government policy, try to change it?\" Rose asked. Hawken and B\u00fcndchen agreed. \n \n \"But I think the way you do that is by bringing forth the information, because I think we are all learning, right? \u2026 And live that what we believe, right? Live our convictions. Like, you know, in my situation, like, we have a plant-based diet. And we've been having it for 10 years,\" B\u00fcndchen said. \n \n \"And why is that?\" Rose asked. \n \n \n \n \"Because we feel better. It is better for our health,\" B\u00fcndchen said. \"And everything we put into our body has an effect on us, has an effect on our energy and how we feel.\" \n \n \n \n \"And your husband says, Tom Brady says, 'Unless I had this plant-based diet, I would not be the player I am and I would not be -- have the career at 39 that I do,'\" Rose said. \n \n \n \n \"He's almost 40, right? \u2026 But the thing is, he said he's been feeling so much better, I have to say it's amazing. You know? The way he feels, he doesn't feel achy. He just feels so much more energy,\" B\u00fcndchen said. \n \n She influenced her family's view on the plant-based diet. \n \n \"So he has his career to thank you,\" Rose said. \n \n \"No,\" B\u00fcndchen said. \"He has to thank his commitment and his dedication to it. Because he still has to wanna do it, right? \u2026 In the beginning he was like, it was a little, you know, different for him. But now he loves it, and he wouldn't have it any other way, because he feels better.\" \n \n Beyond their diets, B\u00fcndchen expressed concern for her husband's health from his activity on the field. \n \n \"If it was up to my wife she would have me retire today,\" Brady told Sirius XM NFL Radio earlier this year. \"She told me that last night three times and I said, 'Too bad, babe, you know, I'm having too much fun right now.'\" \n \n \"As you know, it's not the most, like-- let's say 'unaggressive' sport. Right? Football, like, he had a concussion last year. I mean, he has concussions pretty much every-- I mean, we don't talk about-- but he does have concussions,\" B\u00fcndchen said. \"And he's-- I don't really think it's a healthy thing for your body to go through, like-- you know, through that kind of aggression, like, all the time, that could not be healthy for you, right? \u2026 And I'm planning on having him be healthy and do a lot of fun things when we're, like, 100, I hope.\" \n \n As for Brady's Super Bowl victory, B\u00fcndchen said it was a \"very emotional\" experience for them. \n \n \"I saw the victory as something much bigger than just a victory of like a team playing another team. I thought that was an amazing message there,\" B\u00fcndchen said. \"I was, like, 'You know what? For all the people who feel like, you know, when they're losing, like, they give up, I was, like, never give up.' Like, if you're here, if you're standing, if you're breathing, there is a way. You know? And as long as we have focus and dedication and clarity of purpose, we're gonna make it happen.\" ||||| Gisele B\u00fcndchen is worried for her husband\u2019s future after football, and says Tom Brady had a concussion last year that went unreported. \n \n The NFL, however, has a simple response: Nothing to see here. \n \n Brady\u2019s wife told \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d on Wednesday the superstar Patriots quarterback suffered a head injury last season. The Brazilian supermodel\u2019s bombshell claim led the league and NFL Players Association to look into the matter \u2014 the Patriots could face discipline for not reporting an injury \u2014 and they said it had no merit. \n \n Brady only appeared on the Patriots injury report for knee and thigh issues toward the end of the 2016 regular season. Brady concluded the season by directing a historic comeback for his fifth Super Bowl title. \n \n \u201cHe had a concussion last year,\u201d B\u00fcndchen said when Charlie Rose asked about Brady\u2019s future. \u201cHe had pretty much concussions every, I mean we don\u2019t talk about, but he does have concussions. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a healthy thing for a body to go through that kind of aggression all the time. That can\u2019t be healthy for you.\u201d \n \n The NFL refuted the claim, but also said it would continue to look into the matter. \n \n \u201cWe have reviewed all reports relating to Tom Brady from the unaffiliated neurotrauma consultants and certified trainer spotters who worked at Patriots\u2019 home and away 2016 games as well as club injury reports that were sent to the league office,\u201d the league said in a statement. \u201cThere are no records that indicate that Mr. Brady suffered a head injury or concussion, or exhibited or complained of concussion symptoms. \n \n \u201cToday we have been in contact with the NFLPA, and will work together to gather more information from the club\u2019s medical staff and Mr. Brady.\u201d \n \n The Patriots declined to respond to B\u00fcndchen\u2019s comments on Wednesday morning, and Brady\u2019s agent did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n \n Brady, 39, has said he wanted to keep playing until his mid-40s \u2014 and told ESPN in a recent interview he would continue even beyond that if he were able to stay healthy and productive. \n \n It\u2019s clearly left his wife fretting about the long-term effects of brain trauma. ||||| Tom Brady's wife, Gisele Bundchen, says the New England Patriots quarterback has a history of concussions, including one suffered last year during a Super Bowl-winning season. \n \n \"He had a concussion last year. He has concussions pretty much every -- I mean, we don't talk about it. He does have concussions,\" Bundchen said on \"CBS This Morning\" on Wednesday. \"I don't really think it's a healthy thing for a body to go through that kind of aggression all the time. That could not be healthy for you.\" \n \n The Patriots did not list Brady as having a concussion at any point in the 2016 season, and no concussion or head injury is listed for Brady in his professional career, according to Stats Pass. New England did report leg, thigh and ankle injuries for Brady during the 2016 calendar year. \n \n Editor's Picks 17 seasons of ailments: Tom Brady's entire reported injury history Tom Brady's wife, Gisele Bundchen, said Wednesday that the QB has a history of concussions, but the Patriots have never reported one. Here are all of Brady's listed NFL injuries. \n \n Tom Brady concussion story prompts questions While Gisele Bundchen says her husband has had concussions, including in 2016, Tom Brady has never been listed on the injury report with a head injury. 1 Related \n \n The NFL requires \"significant or noteworthy\" injuries to be reported, regardless of whether a player is expected to miss playing time, and says honest reporting of injuries \"affects the integrity of the game.\" \n \n In a statement issued later Wednesday, the league said records it reviewed did not indicate Brady had suffered any type of head ailment. \n \n \"We have reviewed all reports relating to Tom Brady from the unaffiliated neurotrauma consultants and certified athletic trainer spotters who worked at Patriots' home and away 2016 season games as well as club injury reports that were sent to the league office,\" an NFL spokesman said. \"There are no records that indicate that Mr. Brady suffered a head injury or concussion, or exhibited or complained of concussion symptoms.\" \n \n The league added that it has contacted the NFL Players Association and that they will work together to collect additional information. The union's review of such a matter is standard protocol. \n \n A Comcast SportsNet reporter tweeted a response from NFLPA head DeMaurice Smith. \n \n Happened to have lunch with @DeSmithNFLPA today and brought up the Tom Brady situation, this is what he had to say #NFLPA : pic.twitter.com/SLKqe0az8U \u2014 Jill Sorenson (@JillCSN) May 17, 2017 \n \n The Patriots declined to comment on the report, and Brady's agent didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. \n \n Bundchen was responding to a question about comments Brady has made that she wanted him to retire. She did not specify when Brady suffered a concussion or whether it was medically diagnosed and was not asked a follow-up question. \n \n Her comments come two days after the 39-year-old quarterback reiterated to ESPN's Ian O'Connor that he wants to play into his 40s. \n \n \"I always said my mid-40s,\" Brady said of the prospect of retirement, \"and naturally that means around 45. If I get there and I still feel like I do today, I don't see why I wouldn't want to continue.\" \n \n He told O'Connor that his wife, who retired as a runway model at age 34 in 2015 and has since focused on environmental issues, wants him to play that long as well. \n \n \"She wants me to do that too,\" Brady said. \"She also wants me to take good care of myself and still have my energy. My kids have grown up faster than I thought.\" \n \n Brady started in 12 regular-season games and three playoff games last season, including the Super Bowl. He sat out the first four games last season while serving a suspension related to the Deflategate scandal. \n \n Bundchen said she was more concerned about Brady's long-term health than his football career. \n \n \"That kind of aggression all the time, that cannot be healthy for you,\" she said. \"I'm planning on him being healthy and do a lot of fun things when we're like 100, I hope.\" \n \n In his ESPN interview, Brady acknowledged that his wife would play a role in his decision to eventually retire. \n \n \"She makes decisions for our family that I've got to deal with. Hopefully she never says, 'Look, this has to be it,'\" Brady told O'Connor \"My wife and my kids, it's a big investment of their time and energy too.\" \n \n The Associated Press contributed to this report. ||||| Gisele Tom Brady Has Concussions All The Time 'We Don't Talk About' \n \n Gisele Says Tom Brady Has Concussions All The Time, 'We Don't Talk About' \n \n Breaking News \n \n Tom Brady suffered a football-related concussion last year that nobody knew about -- and he secretly gets concussions all the time -- so says his wife, Gisele. \n \n The supermodel appeared on \"CBS This Morning\" on Wednesday and expressed frustration with Tom's health ... particularly the brain injuries he suffers on the field. \n \n \"Football ... like he had a concussion last year,\" Gisele said. \n \n \"I mean he has concussions pretty much every [year] ...

USA TODAY \n \n There are plans to shutter up to 160 Applebee's and IHOP locations, according to parent DineEquity. (Photo: Andrew Burton, Getty Images) \n \n The parent company of Applebee's and IHOP plans to close up to 160 restaurants, vastly boosting the number of eateries from the two comfort-food chains that it plans to shutter. \n \n Some 105 to 135 Applebee's restaurants will close, up from the 40 to 60 that parent DineEquity said would close in the first quarter. Also on the chopping block are an estimated 20 to 25 IHOP sites, up from about 18. \n \n At the same time, the two chains now will open 125 restaurants globally between them in new locations, DineEquity said. \n \n The casual-dining segment, where both chains are positioned, is experiencing increased troubles as more customers have gravitated to the quick-service restaurants like Panera Bread or Chipotle Mexican Grill, many of which market themselves as offering healthier and more upscale food. \n \n Analysts say Applebee\u2019s, in particular, has had a hard time. \n \n Applebee\u2019s \"remains out-of-favor with casual-dining consumers....Sister concept IHOP may be feeling the effects of DineEquity\u2019s struggles as well,\" said Instinet analyst Mark Kalinowski in a report released Friday. \n \n But DineEquity officials say the painful job of closing restaurants will help in the long run. \n \n \"We are investing in the empowerment of our brands by improving overall franchisee financial health, closing underperforming restaurants and enhancing the supply chain,\" interim CEO Richard Dahl said in a statement. \n \n He said Applebee's is in the middle if a \"transitional year\" and is \"making the necessary investments for overall long-term brand health.\" \n \n The company declined to release a list of locations that will be shuttered. \n \n DineEquity reported net income of $20.9 million, or $1.18 a share, in the second quarter, a drop from $26.4 million, or $1.45 a share, compared to the same quarter last year. \n \n Applebee's domestic system-wide comparable same-restaurant sales declined 6.2% in the second quarter of 2017, while IHOP's declined 2.6% during the same period, according to the company. \n \n \"IHOP remains on solid ground, despite soft sales this quarter. I am optimistic about the growth in both effective franchise restaurants and systemwide sales,\" Dahl said. \n \n DineEquity reiterated its plan to open 20 to 30 Applebee\u2019s, mostly abroad, and revised its plan to open 80 to 95 IHOP restaurants, mostly in the U.S. That's up from the 75 to 90 restaurants globally that it announced previously. \n \n \"Restaurant closures are a normal course of business in the industry and when you have a footprint as large as ours,\" Amy Mason, senior vice president for global communications and consumer insights, said. \"They are either older locations in a lapsed trade area, where once vibrant retail, residential and traffic characteristics are no longer present; others are closed when they are underperforming with unsustainable economics. Closing these well-below average restaurants can have a positive brand benefit since guests are no longer experiencing a substandard experience.\" \n \n On Thursday, the company also named Stephen Joyce, former CEO of Choice Hotels, as its new CEO. He replaces Julia Stewart, who resigned in February; she was at the helm when Applebee's as acquired in 2007. \n \n DineEquity CFO Thomas Emrey resigned in March and no permanent replacement has been named. \n \n The Glendale, Calif.-based company has 3,700-plus restaurants in 19 countries. \n \n DineEquity stock was trading at $38.7, up $1.42 or 3.81%, in mid-afternoon trading. \n \n Related: \n \n Follow USA TODAY reporter Zlati Meyer on Twitter: @ZlatiMeyer \n \n Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2wMoRw5 ||||| On the IHOP side, DineEquity said closures could range between 20 and 25 restaurants, while the company expects to open 80 to 95 new locations, most of which will be in the U.S. That could mean 75 net openings for the chain.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Fans of IHOP and Applebee's, take note: It's possible your hometown location will be closing, though it's also possible one will opening there soon. Parent company DineEquity announced a plan to close as many as 160 of the restaurants and to open up to 125 new ones, reports USA Today. The problem is that the company hasn't decided specifics yet in regard to locations. A safe bet when all is said and done: It will be harder to find an Applebee's in the US but easier to find an IHOP. The Los Angeles Times provides more details on that front: 105 to 135 Applebee's restaurants will close, and while that will be offset slightly by 20 to 30 openings, most of those openings will be outside the US. As for IHOP, 20 to 25 restaurants will close, but 80 to 95 will open, mostly in the US. DineEquity operates 1,968 Applebee's locations worldwide and 1,752 IHOP sites.",

The seemingly damning photo of Lee Harvey Oswald -- who was arrested and charged for the assassination of US president John F Kennedy, but died before trial -- pictures him holding the same type of rifle that killed JFK, and a couple of Marxist newspapers. \n \n Dartmouth College \n \n For over forty-five years the photo's authenticity has been disputed. Oswald said it was fake. And conspiracy theorists -- who believe the assassination was part of a government plot -- cite it as a key piece of evidence in their case. The claim goes that Oswald's pose is physically implausible, and that there are inconsistencies in the lighting, shadows, geometry, and proportions of the image. \n \n Any evidence of tampering in the photo would naturally be used as evidence for a conspiracy -- as unlikely as that remains. But two separate US inquiries have dismissed such claims. And now a study from Dartmouth College has used digital image forensics and 3D modelling to confirm the inquiries' findings, and prove that Oswald's pose in the picture is indeed plausible. \n \n Dartmouth College \n \n \"Our detailed analysis of Oswald's pose, the lighting and shadows, and the rifle in his hands refutes the argument of photo tampering,\" said Henry Farid, senior author of the study. \n \n The researchers built a realistic 3D model of Oswald and manipulated it to stand in the same pose as the real Oswald in the photo. They added mass to different parts of the model in a \"balance analysis\" to see if the model remained stable. It did. They also confirmed that the rifle length is consistent with the one used to murder President Kennedy. \n \n Don't miss \n \n Farid and his team have previously analysed the lighting and shadows in the image -- and concluded the patterns are realistic. \n \n \"It is highly improbable that anyone could have created such a perfect forgery with the technology available in 1963,\" said Farid in 2009. \"As our digital forensic tools become more sophisticated, we increasingly have the ability to apply them to historic photos in an attempt to resolve some long-standing mysteries.\" ||||| HANOVER, N.H. - A new Dartmouth study confirms the authenticity of the famous backyard photo of Lee Harvey Oswald holding the same type of rifle used to assassinate President John F.

Both the Warren Commission and a special House committee on assassinations had already found photo tampering hadn't taken place, and Farid had done studies in 2009 and 2010 that determined the photo's lighting and shadows were indeed feasible, per Phys.org. But some said that Oswald's pose in the photo, in which he appears to be standing somewhat off-balance, was a physical impossibility, so this time around Farid and his team put the photo through a rigorous 3D stability analysis. By adding appropriate mass little by little to each section of a 3D model of Oswald, they were able to examine Oswald's balance to show he certainly could have stood that way.

    "document": "BALTIMORE As night falls on Baltimore on Tuesday, thousands of police and National Guard troops fanned out to enforce a new curfew and prevent further violence as the mayor fended off criticism that she responded sluggishly to a night of rioting, looting and fires. \n \n More than 3,000 police from Maryland, New Jersey and the District of Columbia, and National Guard members in helmets, took up posts in front of businesses and hospitals in Baltimore a day after the worst rioting in the United States in years. \n \n Shops were looted, buildings burned to the ground, 20 officers injured and police arrested more than 250 people in the violence that erupted following Monday's funeral of a 25-year-old black man who died in a hospital on April 19 a week after sustaining injuries in police custody. \n \n The death of Freddie Gray gave new energy to the public outcry that flared last year after police killings of unarmed black men in Ferguson, Missouri; New York City and elsewhere. \n \n For nearly a week after Gray died from a spinal injury, protests in Baltimore had been peaceful and Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said she acted cautiously on Monday because she wanted to avoid a heavy-handed response that would incite more violence. \n \n \"It's a very delicate balancing act, when we have to make sure that we're managing but not increasing and escalating the problem,\" said Rawlings-Blake, 45, an African-American and Democrat who grew up in the city 40 miles (64 km) from Washington, D.C. \n \n Maryland Governor Larry Hogan said he had called Rawlings-Blake repeatedly Monday but that she held off requesting the National Guard until three hours after looting started. \n \n \"The mayor of Baltimore had the city of Baltimore police on the ground. Quite frankly, they were overwhelmed. All the rest of the (boots) on the ground came from us,\" the Republican governor said the day after declaring a state of emergency in the largely black city. \n \n Rawlings-Blake imposed a one-week curfew but stressed the need to respond in a way that did not incite more violence. \n \n Bars and restaurants were shutting down early since they did not expect clients due to the 10 p.m. curfew for all adults, which will last the rest of the week. \n \n \"We have no exceptions other than for medical or coming and going from work. We will be stopping people who are out after curfew. We are taking that seriously. We don't want to engage in any forceful action,\" Police Commissioner Anthony Batts told reporters. \n \n Peaceful protesters marched through some Baltimore streets on Tuesday, but there was no sign of the rock- and brick-throwing that set off a night of looting and arson that burned 19 buildings and left one person in critical condition. \n \n \"They tore the city down last night, and today we're trying to rebuild it again,\" said Perry Hopkins, who formed a line of men from the community separating police from the crowd in the afternoon. \n \n Volunteers armed with brooms cleaned up debris from burned out and looted buildings in the city of 620,000 people, where schools, many businesses and some government offices closed until security improved. \n \n The security crisis disrupted the city's daily routines. In a rare move, the Major League Baseball game between the Baltimore Orioles and Chicago White Sox will be played as scheduled Wednesday but closed to the public. \n \n Acrid smoke hung over the streets and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said it was sending two teams to Baltimore to investigate the multiple blazes on Monday night. \n \n Gray was arrested on April 12 while running from officers. He was taken to the police station in a van, with no seat restraint and suffered a spinal injury. \n \n Six officers have been suspended, and the U.S. Justice Department is investigating possible civil rights violations. \n \n 'DELICATE BALANCING ACT' \n \n \"There's no excuse for the kind of violence that we saw yesterday,\" said President Barack Obama, who said he spoke to the governor and the mayor. \"It is counterproductive.\" \n \n Obama also said at a news conference the problems in places such as Baltimore were not new and need to be addressed by everyone. \n \n \"We can't just leave this to the police,\" Obama said, adding that \"we as a country have to do some soul searching. This is not new. It's been going on for decades.\" \n \n Almost a quarter of people in Baltimore live below the poverty line and decayed, crime-ridden areas of the city inspired the gritty television police drama \"The Wire.\" \n \n Monday's ransacking of stores, pharmacies and a shopping mall and clashes with police in riot gear was reminiscent of rioting in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 after authorities declined to indict a white police officer who shot dead an unarmed black teenager. \n \n Police in Ferguson came under intense criticism last year for quickly adopting a militarized posture, using armored vehicles, showing heavy weapons and using tear gas. \n \n Baltimore police Captain John Kowalczyk told reporters that the city had prepared for protests by teenagers on Monday. But as the violence increased, older people were involved. \n \n \"When we deployed our officers yesterday, we were deploying for a high school event,\" Kowalczyk said. \"I don't think there's anyone in the country that would expect us to deploy with automatic weapons and armored vehicles to an event with 13- 14- and 15-year-olds.\" \n \n (Additional reporting by Jim Bourg and Scott Malone in Baltimore, Laila Kearney in New York, Dan Whitcomb in Los Angeles and Suzannah Gonzales in Chicago; Writing by Mary Milliken and Fiona Ortiz; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Grant McCool) ||||| December 15, 2015 \n \n Quality bicycling trails help define a region\u2019s quality of life. They provide health and transportation benefits. They\u2019re fun and becoming a major tourism draw for the places with compelling facilities. Trails appeal to teenagers, millennials, families, and retirees. Unfortunately, the Baltimore region\u2019s combination of trails is far inferior to Washington\u2019s, Philadelphia\u2019s, New York\u2019s, Boston\u2019s, and we are falling behind Pittsburgh. These other northeastern metros have invested far more and have developed networks and high profile trails. Our region should at least try to be in the same league. The good news is\u2013the six projects identified below, collectively, would cost less than one basic highway interchange and help Baltimore take a giant leap forward. \n \n Other Northeastern Metros are investing in their trail systems. Here are a few of their investments. \n \n This slideshow requires JavaScript. \n \n Right now, Baltimore has a handful of average to good trails, but mostly they are one-offs, with little relation to one another. Imagine if I-95 didn\u2019t connect to the 695 Beltway and 695 didn\u2019t connect to I-83 or 795. These highways by themselves would be useful, but the connected network is exponentially more beneficial. Over the next decade, the Baltimore region should connect its primary trails. It should also develop a few marquis trails that show off the beauty of our city, watershed, and region. Here are six projects that would create the backbone of a connected regional trail network reflective of our affluent region. \n \n Project 1\u2013Gwynns Falls/Middle Branch Trail to BWI/B&A Trail. (Shown in orange) \n \n Estimated cost and length: $10 million, 10 miles (7 miles shared with project 6) \n \n Sister trail: Guadalupe River Trail, San Jose, CA \n \n Project 1, from the Middle Branch Trail\u2019s end in Baltimore\u2019s Cherry Hill Park, to the BWI trailhead-at the BWI rail station, is approximately 10 miles. By completing this missing link, the trail network could continuously reach from Mt. Washington in Northern Baltimore City to Greater Annapolis, a roughly forty mile spine. \n \n There is good news. It\u2019s feasible. The Patapsco River and Stony Run tributary valleys provide virtually continuous right-of-way, which would make the trail relatively free of street crossings, with little need for property acquisition or easements. \n \n There are more reasons to like this project. The river valleys provide great scenery of Baltimore\u2019s most significant river. There are marshes, riverscapes, forests and lots of other features that make for a scenic recreational trail. If project 1 is completed, the trail will connect job centers, neighborhoods, and the rail transit system. \n \n Project 2\u2013Baltimore Trail \u201cBeltway\u201d \n \n Estimated cost and length: $10-20 million, 15 miles of new trail to make 35 mile loop \n \n Sister trail: Beltline, Atlanta \n \n This project is the urban trail version of I-695. It fills in the gaps that would enable a continuous 35 mile loop in Baltimore City. To complete the loop a little over 10 miles of trails would need to be constructed and some additional upkeep on existing trails would improve the experience. This project is being spearheaded by the Rails to Trails organization, headquartered in Washington DC. \n \n This project may not be as logistically easy as Project 1 because it loops through neighborhoods and requires cooperation with CSX and BGE in a few places. However, a theoretical right-of-way has been established and with a little cooperation, this project is feasible. \n \n There are lots of reasons to like this project. It has many of the benefits of Atlanta\u2019s Beltline, but with a fraction of its price. The Baltimore Trail \u201cBeltway\u201d is a home run waiting to be hit because it covers so many bases. Tourism, health, better transportation, recreation, and economic development are expected benefits of its completion. \n \n Project 3\u2013Jones Falls Trail to Torrey C. Brown Trail (Shown in red (Towson Run Trail) and then blue) \n \n Estimated cost and length: $15-20 million, 14 miles (This includes Towson Run Trail Project) \n \n Sister Trail: Rock Creek Trail, Washington DC and Montgomery County, MD \n \n Project 3 connects a trail gap between Mt. Washington in Baltimore City and Hunt Valley, Baltimore\u2019s most northern suburb. The completion of the project would also fill in the missing vertebrae in a trail spine and create a continuous link from Baltimore\u2019s Inner Harbor to York, Pennsylvania. \n \n The Torrey C. Brown trail is, arguably, the Baltimore region\u2019s most popular paved trail. It is heavily used and is part of the Rails to Trails Hall of Fame, but it is isolated. \n \n This connecting project would have to bisect suburban neighborhoods and would likely contain some street routes in spots (with buffered lanes). The bad news is there is no obvious path north of Towson, but the good news is there are many possible routes the trail could take. This project could be challenged by NIMBYism and crossing over the 695 Beltway may be a challenge depending on the course. \n \n There are many reasons this is a good project. We will start with the East Coast Greenway (ECG). The ECG plan is a continuous trail from Maine to Florida. Project 3 fills a key gap in the ECG. Another good reason is access. By extending the mostly rural Torrey C. Brown Trail into the inner suburbs and ultimately the city, far more people will be within reach of a super trail. \n \n Project 4\u2013Middle Branch Loop Trail (Shown in yellow of the Project 1 map) \n \n Estimated cost and length: $4-10 million, 3 new trail miles, 4 total miles (If a trail right-of-way can be constructed on the Hanover Street Bridge replacement, the trail cost will be on the lower end) \n \n Sister Trail: Lake Union Loop, Seattle \n \n The Middle Branch Trail Loop, if completed, will hug the water and help connect Baltimoreans and visitors to the city\u2019s waterfront. The Middle Branch is destined to be the new home for Under Armour. A premier waterfront recreational amenity would be a great cultural compliment between the company, the city, and the water. \n \n The challenge is adding a trail facility on a little-used century-old CSX owned swing bridge and the heavily used Hanover Street Bridge. Furthermore, Under Armour would need to be supportive of a public facility and not seek to privatize the space to the water\u2019s edge. \n \n An urban waterfront loop that utilizes two large bridges may be a big attraction because it\u2019s a unique design that\u2019s rarely implemented. Also, a trail running across a former train bridge adds historical value. \n \n Project 5\u2013The Towson Run Trail (shown in red) \n \n Estimated cost and length: $6-8 million, 5 miles of new trail \n \n Sister Trail: Capital Crescent Trail, Washington DC and Montgomery County \n \n This project would connect the Jones Falls Trail (Shown in brown), the Falls Road Light Rail station, and Lake Roland with Towson University and Downtown Towson and its \u201cbike beltway.\u201d \n \n Building a trail adjacent to the Towson Run stream into the center of the university and to the business district appears to be feasible, but might face some NIMBY opposition in the area between Lake Roland and Charles Street. The trail may need a bridge to cross Lake Roland. \n \n This is a good project because Towson, the Baltimore County government seat and home to over 55,000 people, has few recreational bicycle facilities. Linking Towson via the valley of the Towson Run Creek into the Jones Falls Trail would help solve that problem, while tying Towson into the regional trail network. This project could fill a gap in the East Coast Greenway Project and share the first five miles of Project 3. \n \n Project 6\u2013The Patapsco Trail (shown in dark yellow on the Project 1 map) \n \n Estimated cost and length: $15-20 million, 16 miles of new trail and 18 total (7 miles shared with Project 1) \n \n Sister Trail: Schuylkill River Trail, Philadelphia \n \n This project is identical to Project 1 for about the first seven miles, sharing the Patapsco River Valley at its source in the Middle Branch. Project 1 makes a southerly turn to connect with the BWI Trail. Project 6 continues northwest along the Patapsco Valley paralleling the river. It will feed into the Grist Mill Trail and then extend into historic Ellicott City. \n \n This project appears logistically easy because of existing public right-of-way next to the river. There are a few places the trail will likely have to go underneath major roads. There will be some wetlands the trail may pass through. \n \n Project 6 is a trail with tourist and transportation benefits. It would connect charming historic Ellicott City with downtown Baltimore, while taking a scenic, flat, and relatively direct path along the river. It would provide a great day trip in either direction. \n \n Regions in the Northeast and across the US are investing in their trail networks and marquis trails. They know that quality of life amenities are a major component to region attractiveness and competitiveness. The Baltimore region\u2019s trails are inferior to many of our competitors and the gap is widening. It may be a leap to propose more trails when some of our major existing trails are not well designed and are in poor repair. However, the workforce of the future and tourists will want quality trails.

(Leslie Westbrook/The Advocate via AP) (Associated Press) \n \n 10 a.m. \n \n The wife and other family members of the Louisiana theater gunman asked for a temporary protective order in 2008 against the man. \n \n Court documents seeking the order said John Houser, \"exhibited extreme erratic behavior and has made ominous as well as disturbing statements.\" \n \n The documents said even though he lived in Phenix City, Alabama, he had come to Carroll County, Georgia, where they lived and \"perpetrated various acts of family violence.\" \n \n Houser \"has a history of mental health issues, i.e., manic depression and/or bi-polar disorder\" the filing said. \n \n The filing says Houser's wife, Kellie Maddox Houser, \"has become so worried about the defendant's volatile mental state that she has removed all guns and/or weapons from their marital residence.\" \n \n The protection order was at least temporarily granted. \n \n She filed for divorce in March. \n \n ___ \n \n 9 a.m. \n \n The father of a woman in the theater at the time of the shooting says his daughter was sitting with a friend in the same row as the shooter. \n \n \"They heard a couple of pops and didn't know what it was,\" Randall Mann said. \"And then they saw the muzzle flashes, and that's when they knew what was going on. She hit the floor immediately.\" \n \n Randall Mann said his daughter Emily and her friend escaped uninjured. \n \n \"She's traumatized,\" he said. \n \n The gunman killed two woman and wounded nine other people before he killed himself Thursday night. \n \n ___ \n \n 8:35 a.m. \n \n Police and court records show the Louisiana movie theater gunman has been arrested and ticketed for several offenses in the past, ranging from arson to speeding. \n \n Police officials said at a news conference Friday that 59-year-old John Russel Houser's arrests date 10 to 15 years ago or more. Those include charges of arson and selling alcohol to a minor. He had been married once in the past but was not currently married. \n \n In Alabama, records show Houser had four speeding tickets and one no-seatbelt ticket between 1981 and 2003. \n \n Alabama court records show Houser filed a small claims court lawsuit in 2004 claiming he was injured when he donated plasma at a Phenix City donation center. He asked for $1,800 to pay his emergency room bill and for a narcotics prescription. The case was settled, according to court records. \n \n ___ \n \n 8:30 a.m. \n \n A 19-year-old college student who was watching a movie in a theater across the hall from the shooting says he heard three loud pops before the lights came on. \n \n Jacob Broussard said Friday that he didn't initially know there was a shooting, but as he was evacuating the theater, he saw a woman who had been shot in the leg. \n \n Authorities say a gunman stood up about 20 minutes into the movie and started firing, killing two women and wounding nine others. \n \n Broussard, a student at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, says he felt lucky. \n \n His father, Shannon Broussard, described gratitude for a teacher who apparently pulled the fire alarm to alert theatergoers that they needed to evacuate the building. \n \n ___ \n \n 8:10 a.m. \n \n The two victims who were killed when a gunman opened fire in a Lafayette, Louisiana, movie theater have been identified as 33-year-old Jillian Johnson and 21-year-old Mayci Breaux. \n \n The gunman, who authorities identified as 59-year-old John Russel Houser, killed himself after trying to flee the scene. \n \n Nine others were wounded in the Thursday night shooting that happened during a showing of the comedy \"Trainwreck.\" \n \n ___ \n \n 7:20 a.m. \n \n Authorities are describing the gunman in the movie theater shooting as a 59-year-old man who previously lived in Alabama but is \"kind of a drifter\" who had been in the Lafayette area since early July. \n \n Police said Friday that the gunman fired a handgun 13 times inside the theater, killing two people and wounding at least nine others before fatally shooting himself. \n \n Lafayette Police Chief Jim Craft said the gunman parked his car near the theater's exit door and was intent on escaping, but couldn't because police arrived so quickly. \n \n Authorities have not determined a motive. They searched a motel room he had been staying in and found wigs and other disguises. \n \n ___ \n \n 5:15 a.m. \n \n About a dozen law enforcement personnel were gathered at a Motel 6 in Lafayette early Friday as authorities investigate a shooting at movie theater that killed three people, including the gunman. \n \n Louisiana State Police spokesman Maj. Doug Cain said the theater investigation led them to a room at the Motel 6. Cain said authorities were investigating whether the shooter had stayed there. He said the bomb squad swept the room before going in as a precaution. \n \n About a dozen police personnel could be seen outside the motel. At one point, an officer carried out a cardboard box from the room and other officers could be seen knocking on neighboring doors. \n \n ___ \n \n 3:50 a.m. \n \n The White House says President Barack Obama has been briefed on the shooting at a Louisiana movie theater that left three people dead, including the gunman. \n \n Obama was briefed aboard Air Force One on Thursday by Lisa Monaco, his homeland security adviser, while on his way to Africa for a two-nation visit. \n \n Obama asked his team to keep him updated on the investigation and the status of those wounded in the shooting. \n \n He also offered his thoughts and prayers to the community of Lafayette, Louisiana, where the movie theater is located, and to the families of those who were killed. \n \n ___ \n \n 3:30 a.m. \n \n Lafayette Police Chief Jim Craft told reporters that nine people in total were wounded in the shooting. \n \n He said at least one of those was in critical condition and being operated on at an area hospital. \n \n \"At this point we have three dead, nine wounded and of the three dead one is definitely the shooter,\" he said. \n \n ___ \n \n 2:30 a.m. \n \n Lafayette Police Chief Jim Craft told reporters that based on the investigation so far, they believe the shooter stood up in the theater, started shooting, and then as people started fleeing, he began to leave as well. \n \n But, investigators believe, he spotted two police officers, who had been out in the parking lot when the shooting happened. The shooter then turned around against the crowd before firing a single shot. \n \n \"It looks like he spotted the officers coming in and he turned around and he went against the crowd, and he fired a single gunshot,\" he said. \"He was seated in the theater just like everybody else.\" \n \n \"The information we have at this time indicates that he was by himself, sat by himself and the first two people he shot were sitting right in front of him,\" Craft said. \n \n ___ \n \n 1:10 a.m. \n \n Police say they are checking out suspicious packages inside the Lafayette movie theater where a gunman opened fire Thursday. \n \n Sgt. Brooks David of the Louisiana State Police said a dog alerted to a backpack and other small items in the theater. \n \n Three people were killed, including the gunman, and seven injured in the shooting. ||||| There are on the Patch.com story from Dec 3, 2012, titled Cumming Man Found Murdered in His Deer Processing Business.

He appears to have gone by the nickname Rusty Houser\u2014a name tied to him by an email address listed on a LinkedIn page of the man wanted in the shooting. \n \n Some news reports identify Houser spelling Russell as Russel. On his LinkedIn page, however, Houser identifies past self-employment as \u201cJohn Russell Houser.\u201d \n \n A Tea Party Nation page was registered to that name in 2013. He said he was from Phenix, Alabama, but does not appear to have been very active on the site. \n \n \n \n On PoliticalForum.com, a user identifying as Rusty Houser boasted about posting with his real name and that he \u201csay(s) what he thinks.\u201d In another foreboding post on the site in 2013, he welcomed a newcomer to the forum: \u201cJump in the deep end, I don\u2019t think we have that long.\u201d \n \n \n \n A Debate Politics page registered to Rusty Houser lists his political viewings as \u201cvery conservative.\u201d Among his interests, Houser lists the Greek nationalist party Golden Dawn. It also identifies him as having a hometown of Phenix City, Alabama\u2014and having a JD and CPA certification, just like on the John Russell Houser LinkedIn profile. \n \n Houser\u2019s posts on the site were made in early 2014. In one about Golden Dawn, he called the group \u201ca legitimate effort to solve problems.\u201d \u201cThe leaders of the group are in fact leaders,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIntelligent, well spoken, and exercising good faith.\u201d \n \n \n \n \"Type in WHITE POWER GROUPS and you get mag articles about their never ending claims of racism, and no information of how to find White power groups you might want to join,\" he continued. \n \n \n \n A poster responded: \u201cEvidently you\u2019re from Alabama. You don\u2019t need the Internet to find a white power group. Just stick a sheet over your head and run around in traffic. Somethings bound to hit you.\u201d \n \n In multiple posts, Houser seemed obsessed with comparing America to Iran. On January 18, 2014, he posted a screed about censorship in response to a thread on coverage of Chris Christie\u2019s scandals versus those of President Obama. \u201cThe US heavily censors. Why wouldn\u2019t they twist. You say there is no censorship?\u201d he wrote. \u201dTell me how I can read any of the 30 newspapers printed in Iran. How to find White rights groups on the internet. What your computer gives you when you type AMERICA CENSORS INTERNET, or censors anything.\u201d \n \n Another post on that site echoes distrust of mainstream media. Houser implied that he hopes young people \u201cwill not watch any source of \u2018news.\u2019\u201d \n \n \n \n Yet Houser appeared on a local TV show many times in the early 1990s. He boasted on LinkedIn that he \u201cInvited political controversy on every one of them, and loved every minute of it.\u201d The host told NBC News on Friday morning that Houser was a \u201cradical guy.\u201d \u201cHe was on from time to time because he was a very radical person with radical views,\u201d Calvin Floyd said. Floyd answered \u201cno\u201d when asked if he was surprised that Houser is accused of shooting up the Louisiana movie theater. \u201cThe association I had with him was for entertainment,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was very entertaining. He made for good TV and when it was over, you would leave shaking your head.\u201d \n \n \n \n On a forum about car parts, Houser described himself as \u201cnot brainwashed.\u201d \n \n \n \n Other details of Houser's past also raise eyebrows. Authorities say he was arrested for arson in Columbus, Georgia, but don't have an exact date. The arson charge meant that Houser was denied a concealed carry permit in 2006. His violent streak continued when he was evicted from his home in 2014. Russell County, Georgia, Sheriff Heath Taylor said that Houser then damaged the Phenix City home, and disconnected the gas line to the fireplace. \n \n \n \n On a Topix thread, a Rusty Houser commented on an article about a Georgia farm hiring foreigners: \u201cThe more hard working people with family values we have, the better. What we need to worry about is those who WILL NOT WORK and have no concept of family. They may largely be identified by race also.\u201d \n \n \n \n Get The Beast In Your Inbox!

    "document": "The DSM-5 was officially released today. We will be covering it in the weeks to come here on the blog and over at Psych Central Professional in a series of upcoming articles detailing the major changes. \n \n In the meantime, here is an overview of the big changes. We sat in on a conference call that the American Psychiatric Association (APA) had in order to introduce the new version of the diagnostic reference manual used primarily by clinicians in the U.S. to diagnose mental disorders. It is called the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and is now in its fifth major revision (DSM-5). \n \n James Scully, Jr., MD, CEO of the APA, kicked off the call by remarking that the DSM-5 will be a \u201ccritical guidebook for clinicians\u201d \u2014 a theme echoed by the other speakers on the call. \n \n Why has it taken on such a large \u201crole [both] in society as well as medicine?\u201d he asked. Dr. Scully believes it\u2019s because of the prevalence of mental disorders in general, touching most people\u2019s lives (or someone we know). \n \n The APA has published three separate drafts of the manual on their website, and in doing so received over 13,000 comments from 2010 \u2013 2012, as well as thousands of emails and letters. Every single comment was read and evaluated. This was an unprecedented scale of openness and transparency never before seen in the revision of a diagnostic manual. \n \n \u201cThe manual is first and foremost a guidebook for clinicians,\u201d reiterated David Kupfer, M.D., DSM-5 task force chair, who walked us through the major changes detailed below. \n \n 1. Three major sections of the DSM-5 \n \n I. Introduction and clear information on how to use the DSM. \n \n II. Provides information and categorical diagnoses. \n \n III. Section III provides self-assessment tools, as well as categories that require more research. \n \n 2. Section II \u2013 Disorders \n \n Organization of chapters is designed to demonstrate how disorders are related to one another. \n \n Throughout the entire manual, disorders are framed in age, gender, developmental characteristics. \n \n Multi-axial system has been eliminated. \u201cRemoves artificial distinctions\u201d between medical and mental disorders. \n \n DSM-5 has approximately the same number of conditions as DSM-IV. \n \n 3. The Big Changes in Specific Disorders \n \n Autism \n \n There is now a single condition called autism spectrum disorder, which incorporates 4 previous separate disorders. As the APA states: \n \n ASD now encompasses the previous DSM-IV autistic disorder (autism), Asperger\u2019s disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. ASD is characterized by 1) deficits in social communication and social interaction and 2) restricted repetitive behaviors, interests, and activities (RRBs). Because both components are required for diagnosis of ASD, social communication disorder is diagnosed if no RRBs are present. \n \n Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder \n \n Childhood bipolar disorder has a new name \u2014 \u201cintended to address issues of over-diagnosis and over-treatment of bipolar disorder in children.\u201d This can be diagnosed in children up to age 18 years who exhibit persistent irritability and frequent episodes of extreme behavioral dyscontrol (e.g., they are out of control). \n \n ADHD \n \n Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been modified somewhat, especially to emphasize that this disorder can continue into adulthood. The one \u201cbig\u201d change (if you can call it that) is that you can be diagnosed with ADHD as an adult if you meet one less symptom than if you are a child. \n \n While that weakens the criteria marginally for adults, the criteria are also strengthened at the same time. For instance, the cross-situational requirement has been strengthened to \u201cseveral\u201d symptoms in each setting (you can\u2019t be diagnosed with ADHD if it only happens in one setting, such as at work). \n \n The criteria were also relaxed a bit as the symptoms now have to had appeared before age 12, instead of before age 7. \n \n Bereavement Exclusion Removal \n \n In the DSM-IV, if you were grieving the loss of a loved one, technically you couldn\u2019t be diagnosed with major depression disorder in the first 2 months of your grief. (I\u2019m not sure where this arbitrary 2 month figure came from, because it certainly reflects no reality or research.). This exclusion was removed in the DSM-5. Here are the reasons they gave: \n \n The first is to remove the implication that bereavement typically lasts only 2 months when both physicians and grief counselors recognize that the duration is more commonly 1\u20132 years. Second, bereavement is recognized as a severe psychosocial stressor that can precipitate a major depressive episode in a vulnerable individual, generally beginning soon after the loss. When major depressive disorder occurs in the context of bereavement, it adds an additional risk for suffering, feelings of worthlessness, suicidal ideation, poorer somatic health, worse interpersonal and work functioning, and an increased risk for persistent complex bereavement disorder, which is now described with explicit criteria in Conditions for Further Study in DSM-5 Section III. Third, bereavement-related major depression is most likely to occur in individuals with past personal and family histories of major depressive episodes. It is genetically influenced and is associated with similar personality characteristics, patterns of comorbidity, and risks of chronicity and/or recurrence as non\u2013bereavement-related major depressive episodes. Finally, the depressive symptoms associated with bereavement-related depression respond to the same psychosocial and medication treatments as non\u2013bereavement-related depression. In the criteria for major depressive disorder, a detailed footnote has replaced the more simplistic DSM-IV exclusion to aid clinicians in making the critical distinction between the symptoms characteristic of bereavement and those of a major depressive episode. \n \n PTSD \n \n More attention is now paid to behavioral symptoms that accompany PTSD in the DSM-5. It now includes four primary major symptom clusters: \n \n Reexperiencing \n \n Arousal \n \n Avoidance \n \n Persistent negative alterations in cognitions and mood \n \n \u201cPosttraumatic stress disorder is now developmentally sensitive in that diagnostic thresholds have been lowered for children and adolescents. Furthermore, separate criteria have been added for children age 6 years or younger with this disorder.\u201d \n \n Major and Mild Neurocognitive Disorder \n \n Major Neurocognitive Disorder now subsumes dementia and the amenstic disorder. \n \n But a new disorder, Mild Neurocognitive Disorder, was also added. \u201cThere was concern we may have added a disorder that wasn\u2019t \u2018important\u2019 enough.\u201d \n \n \u201cThe impact of the decline was noticeable, but clinicians lacked a diagnosis to give patients,\u201d noted Dr. Kupfer. There were two reasons for this change: \u201c(1) Opportunity for early detection. The earlier the better for patients with these symptoms. (2) It also encourages an early effective treatment plan, \u201d before dementia sets in. \n \n Other New & Notable Disorders \n \n Both binge eating disorder and premenstrual dysphoric disorder and now official, \u201creal\u201d diagnoses in the DSM-5 (they were not prior to this, although still commonly diagnosed by clinicians). Hoarding disorder is also now recognized as a real disorder, separate from OCD, \u201cwhich reflects persistent difficulty dis-carding or parting with possessions due to a perceived need to save the items and distress associated with discarding them. Hoarding disorder may have unique neurobiological correlates, is associated with significant impairment, and may respond to clinical intervention.\u201d \n \n Jeffrey Lieberman, MD, President-Elect of the APA reminded us that the DSM-5 is not a pop-psychology book intended for consumers: \u201c[It is] a guide, an aide to assist clinicians to \u2026 help facilitate treatment.\u201d \n \n The APA also noted that a large number of sessions \u2014 21 \u2014 will be dedicated to the DSM-5 this weekend at the APA\u2019s annual meeting. \n \n Commenting on the swirling controversy regarding the DSM-5, that perhaps the diagnostic system isn\u2019t good enough, Dr. Lieberman said, \u201cIt can\u2019t create the knowledge, it reflects the current state of our knowledge.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe can\u2019t keep waiting for such breakthroughs,\u201d (in reference to biomarkers and laboratory tests). \u201cClinicians and patients need the DSM-5 now. \n \n Critics have accused the DSM-5 of lowering diagnostic thresholds across the board, making it far easier for a person to be diagnosed with a mental disorder. Lieberman disagrees, however: \u201cHow [the DSM-5] is applied reflects critical practice\u2026 it\u2019s not necessarily because of the criteria [themselves]. It\u2019s because of the way the criteria are applied.\u201d \n \n Want to learn more about the \n \n specific changes in the DSM-5? \n \n Stay updated by visiting our DSM-5 Resource Guide. ||||| The creators of the D.S.M. in the 1960s and \u201970s \u201cwere real heroes at the time,\u201d said Dr. Steven E. Hyman, a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at the Broad Institute and a former director at the National Institute of Mental Health. \u201cThey chose a model in which all psychiatric illnesses were represented as categories discontinuous with \u2018normal.\u2019 But this is totally wrong in a way they couldn\u2019t have imagined. So in fact what they produced was an absolute scientific nightmare. Many people who get one diagnosis get five diagnoses, but they don\u2019t have five diseases \u2014 they have one underlying condition.\u201d \n \n Dr. Hyman, Dr. Insel and other experts said they hoped that the science of psychiatry would follow the direction of cancer research, which is moving from classifying tumors by where they occur in the body to characterizing them by their genetic and molecular signatures. \n \n About two years ago, to spur a move in that direction, Dr. Insel started a federal project called Research Domain Criteria, or RDoC, which he highlighted in a blog post last week. Dr. Insel said in the blog that the National Institute of Mental Health would be \u201creorienting its research away from D.S.M. categories\u201d because \u201cpatients with mental disorders deserve better.\u201d His commentary has created ripples throughout the mental health community. \n \n Dr. Insel said in the interview that his motivation was not to disparage the D.S.M. as a clinical tool, but to encourage researchers and especially outside reviewers who screen proposals for financing from his agency to disregard its categories and investigate the biological underpinnings of disorders instead. He said he had heard from scientists whose proposals to study processes common to depression, schizophrenia and psychosis were rejected by grant reviewers because they cut across D.S.M. disease categories. \n \n \u201cThey didn\u2019t get it,\u201d Dr. Insel said of the reviewers. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do with RDoC is say actually this is a fresh way to think about it.\u201d He added that he hoped researchers would also participate in projects funded through the Obama administration\u2019s new brain initiative. \n \n Dr. Michael First, a psychiatry professor at Columbia who edited the last edition of the manual, said, \u201cRDoC is clearly the way of the future,\u201d although it would take years to get results that could apply to patients. In the meantime, he said, \u201cRDoC can\u2019t do what the D.S.M. does. The D.S.M. is what clinicians use. Patients will always come into offices with symptoms.\u201d \n \n For at least a decade, Dr. First and others said, patients will continue to be diagnosed with D.S.M. categories as a guide, and insurance companies will reimburse with such diagnoses in mind. ||||| The controversial revision to psychiatrists' \"bible\" of diagnostic criteria has finally arrived. The American Psychiatric Association released its fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or dubbed simply as the \"DSM-5.\" \n \n The manual's release was coincided with the APA's annual meeting that kicked off May 18 in San Francisco. \n \n The first major revision to the manual in almost two decades, the new DSM has been met by controversy since reports of proposed changes started to crop up last March. \n \n Revisions to be announced soon to D.S.M. \n \n Doctors often utilize the DSM to diagnose mental health disorders in patients that meet a specific set of criteria. \n \n Among the major changes that garnered the most controversy was dropping Asperger's syndrome, child disintegrative disorder and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD), and included them under the blanket diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. \n \n Revisions were also made to diagnostic criteria for mental health disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, dissociative identity disorder and depressive disorders. \n \n For example, in the last version of the manual, the 1994 DSM-IV, there was was an exclusion criterion for a major depressive episode that was applied to people with symptoms of depression lasting less than 2 months following the death of a loved one. The DSM-5 removed this after the APA realized since the last version that grief can last up to two years, and bereavement can be a severe psychological stressor that triggers depression, rather than an exception. \n \n Besides worrying some mental health advocates over concerns changes in their diagnosis would affect their abilities to get treatment for state funding, the manual's release also pitted the government's National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and the American Psychiatric Association (APA), \n \n NIMH director Thomas Insel wrote in a statement in early May that the NIMH felt the proposed definitions for psychiatric disorders were too broad and ignore smaller disorders that were lumped in with a larger diagnosis. \n \n \"The weakness is its lack of validity. Unlike our definitions of ischemic heart disease, lymphoma, or AIDS, the DSM diagnoses are based on a consensus about clusters of clinical symptoms, not any objective laboratory measure. In the rest of medicine, this would be equivalent to creating diagnostic systems based on the nature of chest pain or the quality of fever,\" he wrote. \n \n The government agency said it would use a different classification system, the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project, instead for its studies. \n \n The NIH and APA released a joint statement on May 13, saying that \"patients, families, and insurers can be confident that effective treatments are available and that the DSM is the key resource for delivering the best available care.\" But, the statement also said, \"The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has not changed its position on DSM-5.\" \n \n A petition was also started by doctors to protest the new DSM. \n \n \"Psychiatrist's bible\" changes: Doctor talks controversy \n \n One vocal critic, Dr. Allen Frances, who co-authored the DSM-IV, told CBS This Morning on Thursday that we are over-treating people in this country who are \"basically well\" and are \"shamefully neglecting\" people with mental disorders who are really sick, including one million people in prison with psychiatric disorders. The new manual, he said, is too loose for its diagnoses. \n \n He said the average diagnosis is being given by a primary care doctor in a seven minute visit. \n \n \"People who are basically normal are getting all kinds of medicine that they don't need that makes them worse and it is a terrible drain on the economy,\" Frances said. \n \n \"I'm very curious to see what happens because as you know there's kind of this tension between the DSM and some of the new NIMH initiatives,\" Dr. James Murrough, an assistant professor of psychiatry and neuroscience at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, told CBSNews.com Murrough was not involved in the new DSM, but will be presenting research at the APA meeting this weekend. \n \n He said by now, some psychiatrists had hoped the new DSM would contain more information about scientific tests or scans for psychologists or psychiatrists to help aid their diagnoses. But, he added the new version doesn't appear to look very different from the last one. \n \n \"I think everyone is kind of disappointed that we don't have that yet,\" he said. \n \n More information about the DSM-5 can be found on the APA's website. ||||| Psychiatry tops all other disciplines of medicine in captivating and confusing the public. It captivates because of the storied disturbances in human thought, emotion and behavior that psychiatrists describe. It confuses because, to the natural question, \"What exactly are these disturbances?\" psychiatrists today just provide a list of diagnoses, as if naming disorders explains them. \n \n Ellen Weinstein The most enduring feature of Freudianism was its claim that important facts about a patient's mental life are buried in the \"unconscious.\" \n \n Jerome Groopman, in his informative 2007 book \"How Doctors Think,\" confesses that \"trying to assess how psychiatrists think was beyond my abilities.\" If this gifted physician finds psychiatry mystifying, how can we expect ordinary people who are seeking help to form suitable judgments? \n \n Things will not improve with the American Psychiatric Association's release this week of the fifth edition of its famed Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). Like its predecessors, the massive new volume will shape what psychiatrists say and do with their patients. It is thus a perfect moment to consider how the DSM came about in the first place\u2014and why this new edition will do nothing to clear up the public's growing confusion. \n \n From about 1940 to 1970, Sigmund Freud's theoretical concepts of mental life and its disorders dominated American psychiatry. The most enduring, problematic feature of Freudianism was its claim that the important facts about our mental life are disguised, buried in the \"unconscious,\" stifled by convention and conformity. \n \n Only a Freudian analyst instructed in the supposedly universal conflicts of human sexuality and domestic life (the Oedipal complex, etc.) could decode and disentangle them. By knowing these secrets, the analyst could derive\u2014from the disguises \"manifest\" in dreams, slips of the tongue, symptoms and behaviors\u2014the \"latent\" truth provoking the different mental disorders. \n \n Freud and his followers played down efforts at gathering such information as a patient's family background, educational and occupational course, intelligence, temperament, habits, medical condition and conscious assumptions. These factors were said to lack psychological depth. \n \n In the 1960s, the authority of the Freudians began to wane in America, partly because their ineffectiveness with serious mental disorders became evident and partly because their treatments were costly, in both time and money. At the same time, the field began to make real progress with the discovery of medications, such as lithium, that were effective against specific and severe mental disorders. New psychological treatments such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy also emerged and helped patients by addressing their conscious attitudes rather than conjectures about their unconscious minds. \n \n Still, among many psychiatrists, the notion persisted that the true causes of mental disorders were unconscious. This belief opened the doors of psychiatry in the 1970s to many wild and conflicting suppositions about mental illnesses. Psychiatrists began acting like Sherlock Holmes, looking for various \"dogs that didn't bark\" to explain their patients' problems. This brought us fiascoes such as the multiple-personality craze and \"repressed memories\" of child abuse. Grotesque therapeutic programs\u2014\"encounter groups,\" the use of hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD, primal-scream therapy\u2014also found their day, in the name of bringing \"the hidden\" to consciousness for treatment. \n \n Ultimately, the profession could not tolerate the mounting turmoil. In 1980, the APA proposed simply setting aside the chaos of claims about the causes and mechanisms of mental disorders, including those of the Freudians. Were there not aspects of mental illnesses that everyone in the profession could recognize and agree upon? \n \n With its third edition (DSM-III), the manual (which had existed since 1952) underwent a transformation. Its editors focused on codifying symptoms that seemed to distinguish one mental disorder from another. If psychiatrists would use these criteria consistently, they suggested, then perhaps researchers would be able to explain and differentiate disorders in terms of psychobiology. \n \n This prescription for diagnostic peacemaking radically changed the psychiatric scene. No longer was it an unruly market of claims, counterclaims and \"orientations.\" Psychiatric practices became centered on using the manual to identify disorders, much as a naturalist uses a field guide to identify birds or trees. The treatments derived from these diagnoses had no particular theory behind them. They were efforts, mostly pharmacological and rule-of-thumb, to provide relief from symptoms. Psychiatric thinking about patients and their disorders withered. \n \n Today the public complains that psychiatrists seem ready to call every state of mental distress an illness. They see that any restless boy can receive a diagnosis of attention deficit disorder, that troubled veterans\u2014whether exposed to combat or not\u2014are routinely said to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, and that enormous numbers of discouraged, demoralized people are labeled victims of depression and have medications pressed upon them. \n \n The public is not far wrong. A recent nationwide diagnostic census based on DSM claimed that the majority of Americans have or have had a mental disorder. As a result, an appalling number of young adults in schools and colleges are on one form or another of psychiatric medication. \n \n The problem, though, is not only that psychiatrists have gone too far in naming mental states\u2014they surely have\u2014but that they have gone on too long with their field-guide checklists. They seem unable to do better. DSM-5 will be more of the same\u2014a way to \"know of\" disorders without \"knowing about\" them, to draw a distinction made by William James. \n \n With its new manual, the APA might instead have started taking steps toward a system of classification that, as in medicine, organizes disorders according to what we know about their natures and causes. Such knowledge, rather than checklists of symptoms, would then direct treatment and research. \n \n Psychiatrists know, for instance, that depression and anxiety can derive from a number of different sources: cerebral diseases such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder; alcoholism or drug addiction; experiences of loss, deprivation or trauma; and, more generally, a vulnerable temperament, characterized by introversion, shyness and emotional intensity. \n \n Deciding which of these sources, alone or in combination, applies to a particular patient requires hours of evaluation. Prescribing an appropriate treatment involves not checking symptoms but determining who the patient is and what he or she has experienced and done. \n \n DSM-5 displays none of this thinking. It remains a field guide organized by symptoms, clustered in categories that can expand without limit. Official, APA-approved psychiatry seems to lack the will to change. It justifies its stagnation not only by reminding its members of the chaos of the 1970s but by claiming that the U.S. health system would not pay psychiatrists if they tried to know their patients the way that they could and should. \n \n DSM-5 is a missed opportunity to advance the discipline, instruct the public and encourage financial support for needed psychiatric services. Its editors seem willing to waste another decade before dispersing the mysteries of psychiatry and bringing practitioners and patients together in understanding what they are doing and why. \n \n \u2014Dr. McHugh is University Distinguished Professor of Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins and former psychiatrist in chief at Johns Hopkins Hospital. \n \n A version of this article appeared May 18, 2013, on page C3 in the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: A Manual Run Amok.",

Biology never read that book.\" Among other changes, the new DSM-5 has encompassed four previously separate disorders under the blanket \"autism spectrum disorder.\" Another change: previously, those grieving for a lost love one couldn't be diagnosed with depression within two months of the death. Now bereavement is actually classed as a trigger. (PsychCentral has a thorough rundown of all the changes.) John Hopkins psychiatry professor Paul McHugh has also criticized the new manual in the Washington Post, saying it encourages doctors to rely on check-lists rather than getting to know their patients. \"DSM-5 will be more of the same\u2014a way to 'know of' disorders without 'knowing about' them,\" he writes.",

    "document": "For years, Google has used its squadron of Street View cars to capture both imagery and 3D geometry for Google Maps and data about Wi-F i networks that it uses in its geolocation-enabled apps. It's been a controversial practice. And on April 27, the company published a blog post to clear up misconceptions about its practices. The tone was very slightly edgy, and the gist was (A) we're not invading anybody's privacy; and (B) other people have been doing this stuff even long than we have. \n \n Except...now Google is saying that its statement that it was only collecting SSID and MAC information from the networks it drove by is incorrect. At the request of the German government, Google examined its system more carefully. And it discovered that for the past three years, Street View cars have been accidentally using a piece of software that can pick up data being transmitted over non-password-protected networks. Since the cars were in constant motion and their network-monitoring equipment changed channels five times a second, the company says it's \"typically\" only picked up \"fragments\" of data. \n \n Nevertheless, it's temporarily grounded the cars, has isolated the data in question while it figures out what to do with it, and says it'll hire a third party to examine the software. And it's \"profoundly sorry for this error\" and will try to learn from it. \n \n None of this is cause for panic -- if anything, Google is guilty of sustained incompetence, not malevolence. Yes, there are scenarios in which the data is used in appalling ways. But the chances of problems arising for any of the individuals whose data was accidentally sniffed are vastly lower than those of the same individuals having their identities stolen by intentional data thieves. \n \n A few other thoughts: \n \n * I'm glad the German government browbeat Google over this. \n \n * Before it discovered it had screwed up, Google insisted it was doing nothing wrong. No company ever admits to invading anyone's privacy. It's always \"your privacy is important to us\" blah blah blah -- and the proper response is always skepticism. \n \n * PASSWORD PROTECT YOUR WI-FI NETWORK. NOW. ||||| Google\u2019s roaming Street View cameras have been doing more than snap pics of your neighborhood; they\u2019ve also been collecting packets of information sent over private WiFi networks, the company acknowledged Friday. \n \n The company said the collection was \u201ca mistake,\u201d the result of a programming error, and that it has now stopped collecting the data, according to a post on its blog. \n \n But the revelation raises questions about whether the company violated federal wiretapping laws in collecting the information and could draw scrutiny from U.S. regulators. \n \n Last month, regulators with the Data Protection Authority in Germany asked the search giant what information its Street View cameras collected and what it did with that information. \n \n Google disclosed at the time that in addition to taking pictures, its camera system collected certain data about local WiFi networks set up in neighborhoods where the cameras traveled. That data included the SSID (the network\u2019s name) and the MAC address (a unique number given to each WiFi router) and was collected to improve the location-based services it offers consumers. \n \n The company asserted, however, that it did not collect or store \u201cpayload data\u201d \u2014 that is, web surfing data or the content of e-mails, transmitted over WiFi networks. \n \n The DPA asked to examine the WiFi network data Google collected. The request prompted Google to take a closer look at the data itself, whereby the company discovered that it was indeed collecting snippets of information passing over WiFi networks and therefore its previous statement was incorrect. \n \n The company wrote in an update on Friday that \u201cit\u2019s now clear that we have been mistakenly collecting samples of payload data from open (i.e. non-password-protected) WiFi networks, even though we never used that data in any Google products.\u201d \n \n The company insisted that the collection was minimal and that its cameras were able to collect \u201conly fragments of payload data,\u201d because the Street View cars are constantly on the move, and someone would need to be using the WiFI network as a Google car passed in order for the data to be collected. The car system also cycles through channels about five times a second, limiting the data it could collect from a single network at any one time. \n \n The problem was attributed to an oversight error. In 2006 \u201can engineer working on an experimental WiFi project wrote a piece of code that sampled all categories of publicly broadcast WiFi data,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cA year later, when our mobile team started a project to collect basic WiFi network data like SSID information and MAC addresses using Google\u2019s Street View cars, they included that code in their software\u2014although the project leaders did not want, and had no intention of using, payload data.\u201d \n \n Google said that once it discovered the issue, it grounded its Street View cars. It intends to delete the data that\u2019s already been collected and is working with regulators to determine how to dispose of it. In the interest of transparency, the company will also have a third party review its software to verify what data was collected and confirm that it\u2019s been deleted. \n \n The company says it has stopped collecting WiFi data network entirely and will review its internal controls to ensure that a similar programming error doesn\u2019t occur again. \n \n Photo: Byrion/Flickr ||||| When we announced three weeks ago that we had mistakenly included code in our software that collected samples of payload data from WiFi networks, we said we would ask a third party to review the software at issue, how it worked, and what data it gathered. That report, by the security consulting firm \n \n , is now complete and was sent to the interested data protection authorities today. In short, it confirms that Google did indeed collect and store payload data from unencrypted WiFi networks, but not from networks that were encrypted. You can read the report \n \n .

Some early reaction: \"It\u2019s not likely that Google grabbed enough data about many individuals for this to be a major privacy concern,\" writes Jason Kincaid at TechCrunch.

Thompson said tips from the public led investigators to the suspect and his home in nearby Port St. Lucie, where a search turned up additional evidence tying him to the crime. \n \n An examination of Schreiber\u2019s social media account also uncovered \u201cmultiple anti-Islamic posts and comments,\u201d Thompson said. He did not elaborate. \n \n But a Facebook page apparently belonging to the suspect - established under his name with photos resembling his booking photo - include a message posted on July 12 that said \u201cALL ISLAM IS RADICAL, and should be considered TERRORIST AND CRIMANALS\u201d written in capital letters with several mispellings. \n \n Schreiber was arrested without incident on Wednesday while walking along a sidewalk in Fort Pierce, Thompson said. \n \n Schreiber, who was being held without bond, was still being questioned by police following his arrest. He was expected to make his first court appearance on Thursday. It was not clear if he had obtained legal representation. \n \n Emergency personnel are seen at the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce which was set on fire, in Fort Pierce, Florida, September 12, 2016. St. Lucie County Sheriff's Office/Handout via Reuters \n \n He has been charged with arson, and his status as a \u201cprison release re-offender\u201d qualifies him for a mandatory minimum prison sentence of 30 years if convicted. And as a \u201chabitual felony offender\u201d whose criminal record includes armed robbery, Schreiber also would be eligible for a life term, police said. \n \n Federal authorities are also investigating the fire for any potential violations of federal law, U.S. officials said. \n \n The Fort Pierce Islamic Center has reported numerous threats of violence and intimidation since it was identified publicly as Mateen\u2019s place of worship. In June a motorcycle gang circled the property and shouted at its members, and in July a Muslim man was beaten outside the mosque.",

He wants to avoid extradition to Sweden over a rape claim, which he denies. \n \n The Met Police says Mr Assange will be arrested if he leaves the embassy. \n \n Swedish prosecutors said the UN panel's decision would have \"no formal impact\" on its ongoing investigation. \n \n Mr Assange earlier said his passport should be returned and his arrest warrant dropped if the UN panel, due to deliver its findings on Friday, ruled in his favour. \n \n The Australian was originally arrested in London in 2010 under a European Arrest Warrant issued by Sweden over rape and sexual assault claims. \n \n In 2012, while on bail, he claimed asylum inside the Ecuadorean embassy in Knightsbridge after the UK Supreme Court had ruled the extradition against him could go ahead. \n \n Swedish prosecutors dropped two sex assault claims against Mr Assange last year. However, he still faces the more serious accusation of rape. \n \n Why is Julian Assange back in the news? \n \n Who is Julian Assange? \n \n Timeline of the Julian Assange case \n \n How unhealthy is living indoors? \n \n 'Avoiding lawful arrest' \n \n In 2014, Mr Assange complained to the UN that he was being \"arbitrarily detained\" as he could not leave the embassy without being arrested. \n \n The application claimed Mr Assange had been \"deprived of his liberty in an arbitrary manner for an unacceptable length of time\". \n \n The UN's Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has been investigating the issue. \n \n The Press Association said key factors in the panel's decision would include the inability of Mr Assange to access political asylum, the fact he has never been charged, and changes to UK law and procedures since he arrived at the embassy. \n \n Wikileaks earlier tweeted it was waiting for \"official confirmation\" of the UN panel's decision. \n \n Downing Street said the panel's ruling would not be legally binding in the UK while a European Arrest Warrant remained in place. \n \n \"We have been consistently clear that Mr Assange has never been arbitrarily detained by the UK but is, in fact, voluntarily avoiding lawful arrest by choosing to remain in the Ecuadorean embassy,\" a spokesman said. \n \n \"The UK continues to have a legal obligation to extradite Mr Assange to Sweden.\" \n \n The Swedish foreign ministry said in a statement that it noted the UN panel's decision \"differs from that of the Swedish authorities\". \n \n The statement added the legal process for Mr Assange's case would be handled in court by Swedish prosecutors. \n \n Image caption Mr Assange issued his statement on Twitter \n \n Per Samuelsson, Mr Assange's lawyer, said Swedish authorities would be \"morally\" wrong to continue the investigation if the UN panel found in his favour. \n \n \"The ball is in Sweden's yard, in the prosecutor's yard. She is not formally bound by the decision by the UN, but morally it is very difficult to go against it.\" \n \n The journalist John Pilger, who is a friend of Mr Assange, said \"the ball is now at the feet of the British government\", whose international legal \"obligations\" were represented by the UN panel. \n \n \"They did something in terms of supporting the tribunal in all the other celebrated cases, and Assange now joins them because the UN jurists have clearly found this is a case of arbitrary detention,\" he said. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Assange's supporter and friend Vaughan Smith hopes he will now be freed \n \n Mr Assange's Wikileaks organisation posted secret American government documents on the internet, and he says Washington could seek his extradition to the US to face espionage charges if he is sent to Sweden. \n \n In the statement, published earlier by Wikileaks on Twitter, Mr Assange said: \"Should the UN announce tomorrow that I have lost my case against the United Kingdom and Sweden I shall exit the embassy at noon on Friday to accept arrest by British police as there is no meaningful prospect of further appeal. \n \n \"However, should I prevail and the state parties be found to have acted unlawfully, I expect the immediate return of my passport and the termination of further attempts to arrest me.\" \n \n Last October, Scotland Yard said it would no longer station officers outside the Ecuador embassy following an operation which it said had cost \u00a312.6m.

(Reporting by Elizabeth Piper, writing by Guy Faulconbridge; editing by Stephen Addison) ||||| A United Nations panel has decided that Julian Assange\u2019s three-and-a-half years in the Ecuadorian embassy amount to \u201carbitrary detention\u201d, leading his lawyers to call for the Swedish extradition request to be dropped immediately. \n \n A Swedish foreign ministry spokeswoman confirmed that the UN panel, due to publish its findings on Friday, had concluded that Assange was \u201carbitrarily detained\u201d. \n \n The WikiLeaks founder sought asylum from Ecuador in June 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden to face questioning over rape and sexual assault allegations, which he denies. \n \n The panel\u2019s findings were disclosed to the Swedish and British governments on 22 January, and will be published on Friday morning. Their judgment is not legally binding but can be used to apply pressure on states in human rights cases. \n \n Julian Assange's embassy showdown: what it means and what happens next Read more \n \n Anna Ekberg, spokesperson for the Swedish foreign ministry, said: \u201cThe UN working group on arbitrary detention has concluded that Mr Assange is arbitrarily detained. The working group\u2019s view differs from that of the Swedish authorities. We will forward a reply to the working group tomorrow. It will be more clear tomorrow why we reject the working group\u2019s conclusions.\u201d \n \n Assange\u2019s Swedish lawyer, Per Samuelson, said earlier that if the working group found in his favour, \u201cthere is only one solution for Marianne Ny [the Swedish prosecutor seeking Assange\u2019s extradition], and that is to immediately release him and drop the case\u201d. Samuelson added: \u201cIf he is regarded as detained, that means he has served his time, so I see no other option for Sweden but to close the case.\u201d \n \n \n \n Assange\u2019s lawyers demanded assurances from the UK that he would not be arrested and subjected to extradition proceedings to face potential prosecution over WikiLeaks\u2019 publishing activities. \n \n The British Foreign Office said it would not pre-empt the panel\u2019s findings, but said in a statement: \u201cWe have been consistently clear that Mr Assange has never been arbitrarily detained by the UK but is, in fact, voluntarily avoiding lawful arrest by choosing to remain in the Ecuadorian embassy. \n \n \u201cAn allegation of rape is still outstanding and a European arrest warrant in place, so the UK continues to have a legal obligation to extradite Mr Assange to Sweden.\u201d \n \n In a statement issued by WikiLeaks on Twitter, Assange said that if the UN panel rejected his claim, he would voluntarily walk out of the embassy on Friday and accept arrest \u201cas there is no meaningful prospect of further appeal\u201d. \n \n He added: \u201cHowever, should I prevail and the state parties be found to have acted unlawfully, I expect the immediate return of my passport and the termination of further attempts to arrest me.\u201d \n \n Neither Sweden nor the UK will be compelled to take any action, but a source familiar with the working group said that if the governments choose to ignore the decision, it could make it difficult for them in future to bring pressure on other countries over human rights violations. \n \n Assange\u2019s lawyers had appealed to the UN panel claiming that his stay in the embassy was arbitrary because he had been unable to exercise his right to asylum, arguing: \u201cThe only way for Mr Assange to enjoy is right to asylum is to be in detention. This is not a legally acceptable choice.\u201d \n \n They also argued that UK law had changed since 2012, which meant that if arrested today he would no longer be liable to extradition under the European arrest warrant. \n \n Melinda Taylor, an Assange legal spokeswoman, said the Australian had not yet been formally informed by the panel of its findings, but \u201cif it finds that the standard for arbitrary detention is met, we would expect his release and compensation\u201d. \n \n In addition to Sweden dropping the extradition request, she called for the UK to return Assange\u2019s passport and give him assurances that he would not be subject to arrest for a potential further extradition request by the US. \n \n Assange and WikiLeaks have been the subject of a secret grand jury investigation in Virginia that has been looking into whether to prosecute them over the US cable disclosures, and the Australian fears that he could become immediately subject to a second extradition process even if Sweden drops its inquiry. \n \n \u201cIf one of the orders is that he should be released and his liberty should be assured, we would obviously look to the UK to make sure that it is effective and not illusory, that it\u2019s not just liberty for five seconds, but liberty that is meaningful,\u201d Taylor said. \n \n British police ended the costly 24-hour guard of the Knightsbridge embassy last October, but the building remains under covert surveillance. A Metropolitan police spokesman said on Thursday: \u201cThe operation to arrest Julian Assange does continue and should he leave the embassy the MPS will make every effort to arrest him.\u201d \n \n Sweden and Ecuador have been locked in lengthy negotiations over arrangements to allow Swedish prosecutors to interview Assange in the embassy. Ecuador\u2019s foreign minister said last month that the country would allow access for questioning, but Sweden later said its request had been rejected \u201con formal grounds\u201d. It is considering whether to submit a fresh request. \n \n Samuelson said his client still hoped to clear his name. \u201cThis does not mean that the question of interrogation will be over. We still want an interrogation to take place so that Mr Assange can clear his name and show everyone that he is innocent. \n \n \u201cThe difference is that he will no longer be in custody in absentia and thus be able to use his asylum outside of the embassy. If Assange is regarded as detained he has already served the time so to speak so Marianne Ny should drop the case altogether.\u201d \n \n Last August Sweden dropped part of its investigation into Assange after the statute of limitations on allegations of sexual assault expired. It is still seeking to interview him on one outstanding allegation of rape. The accusations were made by two women in Sweden in 2010, but no charges have been brought. \n \n Timeline: Julian Assange and Sweden's prosecutors Read more \n \n At the Ecuadorian embassy, the WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said that if Assange\u2019s claim through the UN was successful he planned to appear by videolink at a press conference in west London on Friday. \u201cIf he loses, as he says, he\u2019ll just walk out of there,\u201d Hrafnsson told the Guardian, as he left the embassy building after around three hours of discussions with Assange. \n \n \u201cThe process has been going on for 18 months, the UK government has made submissions to the working group so it has accepted its authority,\u201d Hrafnsson said. \u201cWhat signal does it send that the UK and Sweden would ignore this UN body? It would completely destroy its authority. Are they willing to set that precedent? Egypt has not accepted its findings with regard to the detention of its former president [Mohammed Morsi] - is that the standard the UK wants to hold?\u201d \n \n Assange\u2019s health is fragile from the effects of living inside for more than three years but Hrafnsson said he was busily preparing for Friday. \u201cHowever the decision goes, it is an extremely important moment for him. Hopefully it\u2019s the end of the road.\u201d",

The official ruling is to be made public on Friday, but both the BBC and the Guardian say the panel has sided with Assange. The WikiLeaks founder has been holed up in the embassy for more than three years, hoping to avoid being extradited to Sweden to face sex-crimes charges. In an earlier tweet, Assange said he would turn himself in to police if the panel ruled against him, reports the AP. \"However, should I prevail and the state parties be found to have acted unlawfully, I expect the immediate return of my passport and the termination of further attempts to arrest me,\" he wrote. That appears unlikely: A spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron said Thursday that the ruling isn't legally binding and that Assange\u2014who also fears extradition to the US over the leaking of military secrets\u2014would be immediately arrested if he tries to leave. WikiLeaks, meanwhile, says it is awaiting confirmation of the news reports about the ruling.",
    "generated_summary": "WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange says he will accept arrest by British police if a U.N. working group on arbitrary detention decides that the three years he has spent holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy does not amount to illegal detention. The Australian was originally arrested in London in 2010 under a European Arrest Warrant issued by Sweden over rape and sexual assault claims. He took refuge in Ecuador's British embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden where two women have accused him of sexual assault. Swedish prosecutors said the UN panel's decision would have \"no formal impact\" on its ongoing investigation. The UN's Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has been investigating the issue.",

(Photo: WFAA) \n \n DALLAS-- A recently filed lawsuit in Dallas County District Court blames negligence on behalf of the Boy Scouts of America for the death of a Fort Worth teen three months ago. \n \n Reid Comita,15, died from heat stroke while hiking at Buffalo Trail Scout Ranch in June. \n \n \"The Boy Scouts of America are responsible for my son's death. It's that simple. They are responsible,\" John Comita told WFAA in a sit-down interview. \n \n The new lawsuit outlines a series of allegations surrounding Reid's death, namely that he was \"...sent on an extremely aggressive hike\" in temperatures hovering around 100 degrees with a heat index well over that. \n \n The Comita family had specifically signed Reid up for an introductory backpacking class, under adult supervision, because they felt it was the safest option for their son. \n \n \"He wasn't an athlete. He wasn't prepared to go on an advanced hike,\" his father said. \n \n Photos from the camp's Facebook page show rugged, mountainous terrain meandering through Jeff Davis County in southwest Texas. \n \n The petition further contends that Reid didn't receive proper training at the camp before being sent out on the more advanced hike and that he was accompanied by only two other teenagers, not the required two adults. \n \n The circumstances have left Copper Comita, Reid's mother, baffled, angry and crushed. \n \n \"It doesn't take it away. It doesn't make it any better. It's just that much more pain,\" said Copper. \n \n The lawsuit also outlines communication issues, claiming the Comita family wasn't notified of his death for more than four hours. \n \n \"We were calling, and no one could give us a straight answer as to how he was,\" said Copper. \n \n The backpacking course would have been Reid's final task to accomplish Eagle Scout. His troop has since awarded him the honor posthumously. \n \n \"His friends, his troop, have been great,\" says John. \"But we haven't heard from the BSA or organization at all.\" \n \n The BSA sent WFAA the following statement: \n \n \u201cThis remains a difficult time for our Scouting community, and we continue to keep the family in our thoughts and prayers. The health and safety of our youth members is of paramount importance to the BSA, and integral to everything we do. We strive to create a safe environment for youth to experience outdoor adventure.\" \n \n For Copper, the loss of a son who excelled in studies and choir when he wasn't earning merit badges, is a void that simply can't be filled. \n \n \"He was very special,\" she said. \n \n John says he grew up participating in the Boy Scouts, and that he always felt it was something he could proudly share with his son. \n \n \"It was great bonding for us,\" he said. \"On one hand, they pass themselves off as a great, upstanding organization with the 12 points.

But at least one prominent investor says the market has gotten it wrong. \n \n Warren E. Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and one of the world\u2019s wealthiest investors, told Reuters on Monday that the fall in the market represented a buying opportunity because Japan would bounce back. \n \n \u201cIt will take some time to rebuild, but it will not change the economic future of Japan,\u201d Mr. Buffett said during a visit to Daegu, South Korea, after which he was to meet with Lee Myung-bak, the South Korean president. \n \n \u201cIf I owned Japanese stocks, I would certainly not be selling them.\u201d \n \n While Japanese markets and businesses were closed on Monday for the Spring Equinox Holiday, investors around the world were closely watching the efforts of the Japanese government and Tokyo Electric Power to end the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. \n \n Mr. Buffett\u2019s remarks were confirmed by a Daegu official, Bae Young-chul. Mr. Buffet also said he expected the Japanese disasters to affect the world economy for a while, but that the global impact would be limited. \n \n \u201cFrequently, something out of the blue like this, an extraordinary event, really creates a buying opportunity,\u201d Reuters quoted him as saying. \u201cI have seen that happen in the United States, I have seen that happen around the world. I don\u2019t think Japan will be an exception.\u201d \n \n Mr. Buffett is not alone in his optimism. \n \n \u201cI saw lots of buying last week by overseas investors,\u201d said Yoji Takeda, director of Asian equities at RBC Investment (Asia) in Hong Kong. \n \n \u201cI tend to agree with Mr. Buffett for the long term,\u201d he said. \u201cI suppose the economy will be weaker over the short term but reconstruction spending will eventually help.\u201d \n \n Even without the damage and fear inflicted by the nuclear accident, which followed the earthquake and tsunami, Economy Minister Kaoru Yosano has said the cost of rebuilding the damaged northeastern coast of Honshu, the largest of Japan\u2019s islands, could be more than 20 trillion yen ($247 billion). \n \n In a report Monday, the World Bank said it might take Japan as long as five years to rebuild at a cost of up to $235 billion. \n \n Already, reconstruction-related businesses are booming. Shares of Daiwa House Industry, Japan\u2019s biggest home construction company, and other builders and contractors have soared since disaster struck on March 11. \n \n Mr. Takeda said shares might have been oversold in the market panic last week because of overblown fears about the nuclear plant. \n \n \u201cI think the radiation scare is overplayed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of people fleeing Tokyo, and that\u2019s too much.\u201d \n \n Su-hyun Lee contributed reporting from Seoul. ||||| DAEGU, South Korea Billionaire investor Warren Buffett believes Japan's devastating earthquake is the kind of extraordinary event that creates a buying opportunity for shares in Japanese companies. \n \n Japan, the world's third-largest economy, has been battling to bring an overheating nuclear plant under control after it was battered by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that rattled global markets and prompted massive intervention in currency markets by the Group of Seven industrial nations. \n \n \"It will take some time to rebuild, but it will not change the economic future of Japan,\" Buffett said on Monday on a visit to a South Korean factory run by a company owned by one of his funds. \"If I owned Japanese stocks, I would certainly not be selling them. \n \n \"Frequently, something out of the blue like this, an extraordinary event, really creates a buying opportunity. I have seen that happen in the United States, I have seen that happen around the world. I don't think Japan will be an exception,\" said the 80-year-old investor, dubbed the \"Sage of Omaha\" for his successful long-term investment strategy. \n \n Buffett heads Berkshire Hathaway Inc, which has substantial insurance and utility investments globally. \n \n Japan's Nikkei share average rose 2.7 percent on Friday, buoyed by the G7 support, but still ended the week down around 10 percent, with some $350 billion wiped off share values -- the market's biggest weekly slide since the global financial crisis in 2008. Japanese markets were closed on Monday. \n \n Buffett said Berkshire Hathaway, which at the year-end was sitting on $38 billion of cash equivalent and last week bought U.S. specialty chemicals maker Lubrizol for $9 billion, was looking for more large-scale acquisitions anywhere in the world. \n \n In his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders last month, Buffett had said he was looking for more acquisitions. \n \n \"The United States is most likely where we will do something,\" he said at a ground-breaking ceremony for a South Korean factory run by a unit of an Israeli firm owned by his investment vehicle. \n \n Buffett will have yet more money to invest after Goldman Sachs buys back $5 billion of its preferred stock from Berkshire Hathaway, which the fund bought at the height of the global financial crisis. \n \n EYE ON KOREA \n \n Buffett, ranked the world's third-richest man by Forbes this year, said he was also looking to buy entire businesses and large-cap shares in South Korea -- where Berkshire is already a leading shareholder in steelmaker POSCO. \n \n He said geopolitical risks associated with North Korea had not curbed his interest in South Korea, Asia's fourth-largest economy. Berkshire also owns a stake in Chinese car and battery maker BYD. \n \n Buffett did not disclose any holdings in Japan on Monday, and Berkshire Hathaway's annual report did not show any major investments there. He had been due to visit Japan later this week, but canceled due to the earthquake. \n \n Unlike many foreign fund managers, Buffett, who arrived in the southeastern city of Daegu on Sunday by private jet, won plaudits from ordinary South Koreans. \n \n Sporting gray sweat pants and running shoes, Buffett was greeted by signs reading \"Mr Buffett: Daegu Loves You.\" \n \n Many in this country of nearly 50 million people have bad memories of the 1998 Asian financial crisis when a deal with the International Monetary Fund bailed out the country but at the cost of tens of thousands of jobs. \n \n Some U.S. hedge funds have been branded \"vultures\" for buying South Korean assets on the cheap in the wake of that crisis. \n \n \"It's a once in a life-time opportunity. I'm honored to meet such a respected businessman,\" said Seo Hyun-joo, a housewife wearing Korean traditional dress. \n \n Buffett later meets South Korean President Lee Myung-bak in Seoul and heads to India on Tuesday to launch his firm's insurance selling portal. \n \n (Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin; Editing by David Chance and Ian Geoghegan)",

The person who was killed in the crash was standing on the train platform and struck by debris, Christie said. \n \n The majority of people injured were on board the train, Christie said. \n \n \"The power of the train coming in is devastating at impact,\" Cuomo said. \"We hope there is only one fatality and it stops there.\" \n \n There is no timeframe for resuming NJ Transit service through the Hoboken station, Christie said.

He was thrown into his seat, but was not injured, he said. \n \n \"There was a tremendous jolt, and it seemed like we were on a bit of an incline, and then we kept going,\" Wulwick said. \"There was a horrendous sound of crashing, just a loud, scary, hard sound. It seemed like we were going for a little bit. When I got out and saw the damage, it was amazing how far the train went.\" \n \n Wulwick said the speed of the train seemed normal before the crash. \n \n \"It didn't seem anything out of the ordinary,\" Wulwick said. \"I'm on the train for some 30 odd years. I didn't seem like it was going faster than it should have been.\" \n \n In the immediate aftermath, there was \"absolute panic. Screaming. Just screaming and panic.\" \n \n Some were trying to calm down other passengers, and someone kicked out the emergency window on the train, and passengers started to climb through. At the same time, the door of the train opened, and most people left that way, Wulwick said. \n \n He didn't see anyone seriously injured, except one man in a torn suit with a large gash to his head who seemed to be in shock. The scene inside the station was equally jarring, Wulwick said. \n \n \"The ceiling was totally demolished,\" Wulwick said. \"It was collapsed, wires all over the place.\" ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

(RAI) agreed to buy rival Lorillard Inc. (LO) for about $25 billion excluding debt, a deal that would leave the 400-year-old U.S. tobacco industry with two competitors controlling 90 percent of the market. \n \n Reynolds, the maker of Camel and Pall Mall cigarettes, will pay cash and stock valuing Lorillard at $68.88 a share, according to a statement. British American Tobacco Plc (BATS) will fund $4.7 billion of the transaction, letting it maintain a 42 percent stake in Reynolds. BAT\u2019s U.K. rival Imperial Tobacco Group Plc (IMT) will acquire brands such as Kool and Blu e-cigarettes for $7.1 billion in a bid to assuage antitrust concerns. \n \n Modernized Cigarette Seeks Respectability \n \n Decades of anti-tobacco health campaigns have hurt demand and put pressure on the industry to consolidate. Acquiring Lorillard, the U.S. industry\u2019s third-largest competitor, would help Reynolds cope with the slowdown and give it the Newport menthol line, which is popular in urban areas. Still, the deal faces challenges, and investors signaled that they\u2019re uncertain it will close in its current form. Lorillard shares slid to $60.17 in New York, 13 percent below the purchase price. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of risk,\u201d said Owen Bennett, an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc. in London. \u201cThere are a lot of factors involved.\u201d \n \n Photographer: Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg Lorillard Inc. brand Newport cigarettes aa a store in Shelbyville, Kentucky. Close Lorillard Inc. brand Newport cigarettes aa a store in Shelbyville, Kentucky. Close Open Photographer: Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg Lorillard Inc. brand Newport cigarettes aa a store in Shelbyville, Kentucky. \n \n Including debt, the purchase is valued at $27.4 billion. The new company will have annual revenue of more than $11 billion -- almost two-thirds the yearly sales of U.S. market leader Altria (MO) Group Inc. -- and operating income of about $5 billion. \n \n Market Share \n \n Reynolds shares also fell, dropping 6.9 percent to $58.84. Imperial Tobacco declined 3.7 percent to 2,638 pence in London, while BAT fell 1.8 percent to 3,532 pence. Altria dropped 3.7 percent to $41.76. \n \n Reynolds said the combined company will account for almost 33 percent of the U.S. industry. That leaves the U.S. with two competitors -- Reynolds and Altria -- selling nine out of every 10 cigarettes. Imperial said its market share will more than triple to 9.5 percent from 2.5 percent. \n \n The companies will fight for customers in an industry where health concerns and smoking restrictions have eroded sales. Total U.S. cigarette shipments fell by a median of 2.9 percent in the first quarter among the nation\u2019s top tobacco companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Industries. \n \n Yet even amid the slump, the companies have remained profitable, with Altria, Reynolds and Lorillard all boosting net income last year. \n \n Lorillard Drops \n \n The deal -- which followed months of intermittent talks -- will have to pass antitrust hurdles. As part of the effort to overcome those challenges, Imperial will acquire well-known brands such as Salem, Winston and Maverick. Getting the Blu lineup also gives Imperial a foothold in the emerging market for e-cigarettes -- battery-powered devices that can deliver nicotine and other substances through vapor. \n \n \u201cThe most surprising element is that Imperial is taking the e-cigarette business from Lorillard,\u201d said Philip Gorham, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. in Amsterdam. \u201cIt was probably the sweetener that convinced them to buy what is essentially a selection of third-tier brands.\u201d \n \n Including the Blu brand in the deal was needed to get Imperial to the table and reduced antitrust concerns from having the products in the same company as Reynolds\u2019s Vuse e-cigarettes, said a person familiar with the matter. \n \n E-Cig Sales \n \n U.S. e-cig sales were forecast by Euromonitor International to triple last year to $1.5 billion and then double annually through 2018. Still, the products face uncertainty as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration explores how to regulate them while cities and employers debate where they can be used. \n \n Reynolds is \u201cabsolutely confident\u201d in the future of its Vuse e-cig brand, Chief Executive Officer Susan Cameron said today in an interview. \n \n Reynolds said cost savings from the deal will be about $800 million and that it will add to earnings in the first year. Cameron will continue as CEO of Reynolds after the acquisition, and the company will remain headquartered in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Murray Kessler, chairman, president and CEO of Greensboro, North Carolina-based Lorillard, will join Reynolds\u2019s board. \n \n Reynolds and BAT also agreed to share next-generation tobacco technology, including heat-not-burn cigarettes and vapor products. Imperial will acquire Lorillard\u2019s manufacturing and research facilities in Greensboro and about 2,900 employees, including a national sales force. \n \n Newport Brand \n \n Lorillard\u2019s biggest product, Newport, will give Reynolds fresh ammunition against Altria, whose brands account for more than half of the U.S. retail cigarette industry. Altria\u2019s Marlboro by itself has market share in the U.S. of about 44 percent, according to the company\u2019s website. \n \n Newport is the second-most-popular brand among all U.S. cigarettes and the leader among menthol smokes, which account for about a third of the $90 billion U.S. cigarette market. The brand was the main selling point for Reynolds, and recent signals that the FDA won\u2019t institute overly onerous regulations on menthols gave the company confidence to move ahead with the purchase, said a person familiar with the situation. \n \n Lazard served as lead financial adviser to Reynolds, which also consulted with JPMorgan Chase & Co., while Centerview Partners and Barclays Plc advised Lorillard. Jones Day LP provided legal counsel to Reynolds, while Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP served as Lorillard\u2019s legal adviser. \n \n Imperial Tobacco, which said it will fund its portion of the transaction entirely through debt, is being advised by Credit Suisse Group AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. \n \n Months Talking \n \n Reynolds, Lorillard and London-based BAT have been in talks since last fall to reach an agreement that would satisfy all three parties, people familiar with the matter have said. \n \n Those discussions got a boost when Cameron returned as Reynolds\u2019s CEO in May, Kessler said in an interview. \n \n She was instrumental \u201cin getting this transaction from what was sort of out there and theoretical to a very compelling transaction that our board could support,\u201d Kessler said. \u201cShe was extremely helpful in bringing that home.\u201d \n \n The companies made a tentative deadline of July to reach a deal because of an agreement by BAT not to raise its stake in Reynolds without the approval of Reynolds\u2019s board until this month, people familiar have said. \n \n BAT\u2019s agreement keeping it from increasing its stake in Reynolds dates back to the merger of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Inc. with Brown & Williamson Tobacco. \n \n Hard Look \n \n The Federal Trade Commission is likely to take a hard look at the latest proposed transaction, according to David Balto, a Washington attorney and former policy director for the FTC who litigated BAT\u2019s merger with Reynolds in 2004. \n \n The FTC allowed that deal to go through because Brown & Williamson was losing market share and Lorillard was still a viable competitor, according to the FTC. The market is more consolidated now, and this deal will face serious scrutiny, Balto said. \n \n Selling off the minor brands to Imperial, and even unloading a bigger name like Camel, may not be enough, he said. \n \n \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put any number on the likelihood of this deal being approved,\u201d Balto said in an interview. \u201cI think it would need to be more substantial than Camel.\u201d \n \n To contact the reporters on this story: Duane D.

The firm can continue to operate in the capital \u2013 where it has 3.5 million users \u2013 until it has exhausted the appeals process, which could take months.. \n \n How will you be affected by Uber losing its licence to operate in London? Read more \n \n Uber\u2019s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, wrote to staff on Friday confirming that the company would appeal against the ruling. He said he disagreed with the decision but it was based on past behaviour. \n \n \u201cThe truth is that there is a high cost to a bad reputation,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt really matters what people think of us, especially in a global business like ours. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s critical that we act with integrity in everything we do, and learn how to be a better partner to every city we operate in. That doesn\u2019t mean abandoning our principles \u2013 we will vigorously appeal TfL\u2019s decision \u2013 but rather building trust through our actions and our behaviour. In doing so, we will show that Uber is not just a really great product, but a really great company that is meaningfully contributing to society, beyond its business and its bottom line.\u201d \n \n Khosrowshahi, who was brought in to run the firm after a series of scandals, also tweeted an appeal to Londoners to \u201cwork with us\u201d in solving the issue. \n \n dara khosrowshahi (@dkhos) Dear London: we r far from perfect but we have 40k licensed drivers and 3.5mm Londoners depending on us. Pls work w/us to make things right \n \n The decision by TfL was backed by the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, employment rights campaigners, and the trade body for the capital\u2019s black-cab drivers, who have been staunch opponents of the US-based company. \n \n However, it drew immediate criticism from Uber users, drivers and Greg Hands, the trade minister. \n \n \n \n One of Uber\u2019s 40,000 drivers in the capital, James Farrar, who has campaigned for better working conditions at the firm, said TfL\u2019s decision was a \u201cdevastating blow\u201d. \n \n TfL said it had rejected the company\u2019s application to renew its licence because \u201cUber\u2019s approach and conduct demonstrate a lack of corporate responsibility\u201d in relation to reporting serious criminal offences, obtaining medical certificates and driver background checks. \n \n The licensing body also said it was concerned by Uber\u2019s use of Greyball, software that can be used to block regulatory bodies from gaining full access to its app and undertaking regulatory or law enforcement duties. \n \n The decision to remove Uber from one of its biggest markets is the latest blow for a company that has shot to a $70bn (\u00a352bn) valuation since it was founded in 2009 but has been hobbled by opposition from national and municipal governments around the world \u2013 including in Italy and Rio de Janeiro \u2013 due to concerns over safety or the threat to existing taxi businesses. \n \n \n \n Prof Andre Spicer, from Cass Business School in London, said the decision was a \u201cpotentially mortal blow\u201d to Uber. \u201cIn the past Uber operated at the edge of the law with new technology as an alibi. Now its rogue business model is proving to be a big liability.\u201d \n \n Khan said he fully supported TfL\u2019s decision, saying all companies needed to \u201cplay by the rules\u201d. \n \n \n \n He said: \u201cI want London to be at the forefront of innovation and new technology and to be a natural home for exciting new companies that help Londoners by providing a better and more affordable service. \n \n \u201cHowever, all companies in London must play by the rules and adhere to the high standards we expect \u2013 particularly when it comes to the safety of customers.\u201d \n \n But Hands, who is also minister for London, said: \u201cAt the flick of a pen Sadiq Khan is threatening to put 40,000 people out of work and leave 3.5 million users of Uber stranded. \n \n \u201cUber must address safety concerns and it is important there is a level playing field across the private hire market. \n \n \u201cBut a blanket ban will cause massive inconvenience to millions of Londoners, all while showing that the Mayor of London is closed to business and innovation.\u201d \n \n Sam Gyimah, a Conservative justice minister and MP for East Surrey, said it was \u201cpossible to have effective regulation of Uber without \n \n penalising the consumers who benefit from more choice and lower \n \n prices\u201d. \n \n How will TfL's decision affect Uber? Read more \n \n Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers\u2019 Association, which represents black-cab drivers, said the mayor had made the right decision. \n \n \u201cSince it first came on to our streets Uber has broken the law, exploited its drivers and refused to take responsibility for the safety of passengers. This immoral company has no place on London\u2019s streets,\u201d he said. \n \n Uber said in a statement the decision would \u201cshow the world that, far from being open, London is closed to innovative companies\u201d. \n \n \u201c3.5 million Londoners who use our app, and more than 40,000 licensed drivers who rely on Uber to make a living, will be astounded by this decision,\u201d the company added. \n \n The company wrote to users on Friday asking them to \u201cdefend the livelihoods\u201d of its drivers and sign a petition asking the mayor to reverse TfL\u2019s decision. \n \n Uber (@Uber) Help ensure Londoners have more, not fewer, transportation options\u2014sign the petition. https://t.co/nheuOcYjQH \n \n Farrar, a co-claimant in a landmark employment tribunal decision against Uber and chair of the Independent Workers\u2019 Union of Great Britain\u2019s private hire drivers\u2019 branch, said TfL should have stepped in earlier to protect drivers. \n \n \u201cTo strip Uber of its licence after five years of laissez-faire regulation is a testament to a systemic failure at TfL,\u201d he said. \n \n The majority of Uber users responding to a Guardian request for comment opposed the decision to revoke the company\u2019s licence. \n \n Helen, from Walthamstow in east London, criticised the decision and said TfL should be working more closely with Uber. \u201cWith a lack of staff and police visible [on public transport], I often feel unsafe travelling alone and Uber has given me an affordable alternative to get home safely,\u201d she said. \n \n Leo, a wheelchair user, said less than 30% of the tube network was accessible to him and buses were slow. \u201cUber has been a lifesaver for me. It has got me to visit family at short notice when the nearest accessible station was miles away and the bus took two hours,\u201d he said. \n \n Uber is treating its drivers as sweated labour, says report Read more \n \n In London, Uber has faced criticism from unions, lawmakers and traditional black-cab drivers over working conditions. Unions including the IWGB and GMB called on TfL to insist Uber guaranteed basic employment rights under the terms of its new five-year licence. \n \n Employment rights campaigners said TfL\u2019s decision was a warning shot to so-called gig economy companies, which include apps such as Deliveroo and delivery firms such as Hermes who argue their drivers and riders are self-employed. \n \n Frank Field, the Labour MP who led a parliamentary inquiry which found that Uber drivers were treated as Victorian-style \u201csweated labour\u201d said: \u201cThis is a gamechanger for the gig economy.

As he worked to mend ties with Germany in its espionage dispute with the U.S. and handle the ongoing crisis in Israel and Gaza, Kerry also took on face-to-face meetings with his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif with a ticking clock behind them. By the day's end, no breakthrough had been produced and representatives from the six countries negotiating with Iran said that big hurdles remained. \n \n The expiration of the interim deal \n \n After decades of tense relations and mistrust, Iran and the United States (as part of the P5+1 Group) surprised the world by managing to secure an interim deal last fall that would ease sanctions on the Islamic Republic in exchange for suspending work on its nuclear program. July 20 was the date set for the deal to expire. And here we are. \n \n While there have been some slight hints that discussions could extend beyond the deadline, the P5+1 group seems keen on getting a deal done by July 20. \n \n As the Associated Press noted: \n \n Lower-ranking officials represented both Russia and China, possibly reflecting their view even before Sunday that talks past July 20 are unavoidable. But Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi suggested any extension would be relatively short, saying \"there is not much willingness\" by either side to go a full six months. He, too, earlier spoke of \"huge and deep differences.\" \n \n \"There is a huge gap\" \n \n As reported, several gaps remain between the six countries and Iran, including major questions about the level to which Iran can enrich its uranium. Today, things got interesting. \n \n Word started to spread about a speech given several thousand miles east of Vienna, in which Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei emphasized the need for Iran to enrich its uranium capacity at the very moment that the Iranian nuclear delegation and the P5+1 Group were bargaining to reduce it. \n \n As the news broke, the words \"scuttle\" and \"undermine\" began floating: \n \n Basically looks like Khamenei cut Zarif and co at the knees: http://t.co/9CMVgKD6dX \u2014 Jordan Hirsch (@jordanchirsch) July 14, 2014 \n \n Classic Khamenei: 1) Express support for negotiations 2) Undermine negotiators by setting impossible red lines. http://t.co/7dhb5BIzO9 \u2014 Karim Sadjadpour (@ksadjadpour) July 14, 2014 \n \n Does Iran want a deal? \n \n Are these negotiating tactics or reluctance?

Would economic relief be simply convenient, or does Iran consider failure to achieve it an existential threat to the regime? The negotiations won't succeed unless Iran wants a deal more than its international interlocutors do.

(Associated Press) \n \n U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry leaves the hotel where closed-door nuclear talks on Iran take place in Vienna, Austria, , Monday, July 14, 2014. Secretary of State John Kerry was deep in discussions... (Associated Press) \n \n The state of U.S.-Iranian relations was adding a new wrinkle to the long negotiation aimed at curbing the Islamic republic's uranium and plutonium programs. \n \n While the two sides are arguably fighting proxy wars in Israel, Gaza and Syria, they're talking cooperation in Iraq and Afghanistan. And, perhaps in a first, the nuclear matter is battling for full attention. \n \n U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif spoke for about two hours around midday Monday, the second day of talks in Vienna. They gathered again in the afternoon, hoping to make progress before Sunday's initial deadline for a comprehensive nuclear agreement. An extension of the deadline is possible, though there are opponents of that idea on both sides. \n \n \"We are in the middle of talks about nuclear proliferation and reining in Iran's program,\" Kerry told U.S. Embassy staff in Vienna during a break in the conversations. \"It is a really tough negotiation.\" \n \n But other matters were being discussed, too, including Afghanistan, where Kerry visited before Vienna to broker a power-sharing agreement between rival presidential candidates and a full audit of their contested election. \n \n As the two diplomats sat down Sunday, Zarif called Kerry's Afghan mediation \"extremely important\" for the Afghan people and echoed the need \"to ensure the national unity of Afghanistan and prevent its breakup.\" \n \n \"We agree,\" Kerry said. \"And it's good to begin with an agreement.\" \n \n But even as the U.S. and Iran have recently found increasing areas for cooperation, such as stemming a flow of Sunni extremists into Iraq, they remain diametrically opposed elsewhere. \n \n The U.S-Iranian regional divide was underscored Monday as the Israeli military downed a drone launched by Gaza militants \u2014 the first such unmanned aircraft encountered since the start of the Jewish state's offensive last week. \n \n Iran is Hamas' primary benefactor and the presumed source of its newfound drone capacity. Washington provides billions in aid each year to Israel. \n \n The State Department didn't say if Kerry and Zarif broached the escalating Israeli-Palestinian violence or the civil war in neighboring Syria, where the U.S. is providing political and military support to moderate rebels fighting President Bashar Assad's Iranian-backed government. \n \n But one change appeared clear in this week's talks. Unlike in years past, where U.S.-Iranian interaction appeared largely limited to nuclear matters, the two countries' interests now crisscross at multiple levels, and their discussions are broader. \n \n Nevertheless, American officials said Kerry was focused on tackling the many differences between the U.S. and Iran on nuclear matters. His goal is to gauge \"Iran's willingness to make the critical choices it needs to make,\" according to a senior State Department official. \n \n The official wasn't authorized to be quoted by name and demanded anonymity. \n \n Monday's talks came a day after Kerry and the foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany failed to reach a breakthrough with Iran on uranium enrichment and other issues standing in the way of a deal that would curb Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the end of nuclear-related sanctions on Tehran. Each official cited significant gaps. \n \n Iran says it needs to expand enrichment to make reactor fuel and insists it does not want atomic arms. But the U.S. and others fear Tehran could steer the activity toward manufacturing the core of nuclear missiles. Washington is leading the insistence on deep enrichment cuts. \n \n Under a six-month interim agreement that went into effect in January, world powers and Iran have until July 20 to conclude a final deal. The goal for the West is a long-term agreement setting clear limits on Iranian activity and locking in place an international monitoring regime to ensure that the Islamic republic cannot develop nuclear weapons. \n \n The interim arrangement also offers the option of an additional six-month period for negotiations, an extension that appears increasingly likely. Officials have suggested they may agree on a shorter window, however. \n \n In Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest wouldn't say whether President Barack Obama had authorized Kerry to extend the deadline if necessary. \n \n \"To its credit, Iran has defied the expectations of some,\" Earnest said, by fulfilling some of the steps it agreed to take. But he said on other key issues Iran hasn't yet made the decisions needed to prove the world its intentions are peaceful. \"That's ultimately where the gaps remain,\" he said. \n \n For the U.S. and Iran, an extension makes sense in multiple ways. With so much at stake, and the potential for U.S.-Iranian cooperation in other areas being explored, neither side wants to terminate the nuclear talks. Such a course could put Tehran back on a path toward isolation and even set the stage for U.S. military action if Iran proceeded again toward nuclear weapons capacity. \n \n Even if their interests in continuing nuclear talks align, both face difficult internal pressures against a deal \u2014 or an extension for that matter. \n \n Iranian hardliners oppose almost any concession by President Hassan Rouhani's government. In the U.S., some lawmakers have threatened to scuttle any emerging agreement if it would allow Iran to maintain some enrichment capacity. \n \n A letter being circulated in Congress by Sens. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., emphasizes that a lessening of U.S. sanctions should be conditional on the nuclear agreement making tough demands on Iran. \n \n These would include international inspections lasting for a minimum of two decades and full disclosure by Iran of any military aspects of its nuclear program.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A Sunday deadline is looming for Iran to strike a nuclear deal with six world powers under a plan set in motion last year\u2014but with just days to go, Iran's supreme leader has made the chances of a deal being forged in time look supremely unlikely. In a major speech, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the country will need 190,000 centrifuge machines, 19 times as many as the 10,000 negotiators from the US, France, Britain, Russia, China, and Germany want to limit the country to in order to reduce its capacity to build nuclear weapons. After the leader's speech appeared to undermine negotiators, analysts began to wonder whether Iran really wants a deal that would limit its nuclear capacity in return for the lifting of sanctions, or if Khamenei is playing for time, the Atlantic notes. \"In ostensibly expressing support for the Iranian negotiating team, close scrutiny of Khamenei's speech shows that in reality his remarks were aimed at severely curtailing his team's room for maneuver, making it effectively impossible to bridge gaps with the stance\" of the six powers, an intelligence analysis seen by Reuters states. If all sides agree, the talks could be extended for another six months, though US officials say they will need to see some progress in the days to come before they will agree to an extension. John Kerry joined the talks in Vienna yesterday, but it's not clear whether he made any progress during hours of talks with Iran's foreign minister; issues including Afghanistan were also discussed, the AP reports.",
    "generated_summary": "With just six days before the deadline, Iran's nuclear talks seem to be faltering. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry arrived in Vienna on Sunday. By the day's end, no breakthrough had been produced and representatives from the six countries negotiating with Iran said that big hurdles remained. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei emphasized the need for Iran to enrich its uranium capacity at the very moment that the Iranian nuclear delegation and the P5+1 Group were bargaining to reduce it. But there is a difference between wanting a deal and considering one essential. Would economic relief be simply convenient, or does Iran consider failure to achieve it an existential threat to the regime?",

The caption: \"Just an average day for a Golden Corral Employee, best working conditions ever!\" \n \n SEE ALSO: Taco Bell Employee Who Licked Taco Shells Is Getting Fired \n \n That, coupled with the video above, has prompted a subReddit devoted to the chain. \n \n A rep from the chain offered the following statement: \n \n A video was recently posted showing an incident of improper food handling at our Port Orange, Fla., location. None of these items were served to a single customer. All were destroyed within the hour at the direction of management. Brandon Huber, the employee who made the video, participated in the disposal of the food. \n \n \n \n The following day, the father of the employee, posted an offer to sell the video for $5,000, which was not accepted. \n \n \n \n The manager involved in the improper storage was terminated for failing to follow approved food handling procedures. \n \n Huber could not be reached for comment. \n \n The barrage comes after images of a Taco Bell employee licking some taco shells emerged on Facebook last month.

It was called \u201cBomb Squad\u201d and it wasn\u2019t any fun at all. \n \n Over the next few weeks, two important things happened: First, after neglecting work, family, and a social life, Shane and Elan developed a rule-set that started working and brought the game to life. Second, Matt Inman saw the game, thought it was super fun, and asked to join the team. (btw, if Matthew Inman ever asks you if he can join your team, the answer is \u201cHELL YES\u201d.) \n \n We changed the name to \"Exploding Kittens\" and our little team was born. \n \n BUT YOU'RE BLOWING UP KITTENS! NOT COOL, BUDDY. \n \n We struggled with this a lot. We love the name Exploding Kittens, but we don't want to hurt kittens. We also don't want the kittens to be hurt by anyone else. Eventually we decided to explore the concept of the kittens blowing themselves up. \n \n First, Matt tried drawing the kittens as the actual bombs: \n \n But that felt too Angry Birds\u2019ish. \n \n Next, we tried making the kittens suicidal, but that felt terrible. \n \n In the end, we realized that everyone understands feline shenanigans, and that could be our solution. Our kitties would not blow up out of malicious intent or negligence, but by doing the things that kittens do, like running across keyboards or chewing on things they shouldn't be chewing on. \n \n From there, the rest of the cards fell into place, and the cards used to defuse the exploding kittens were items you'd use to defuse regular kittens. \n \n HELP US BUILD THIS GAME \n \n We wanted to put this project on Kickstarter because it's the fastest way for us to get the game into your hands and make improvements as a community. We think this game is great, but we need your help making it even better. \n \n So, if a world full of weaponized pork missiles is a world you want to live in, please back this project and help us build this game. \n \n \n \n With love and pork missiles, \n \n -The Exploding Kittens Team (Matt, Elan, and Shane) \n \n \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n For more information about the game: http://www.explodingkittens.com \n \n \n \n Follow us: Facebook Twitter \n \n \n \n Music: Royalty-free music from Bensound. ||||| All artwork and content on this site is Copyright \u00a9 2018 Matthew Inman.

That player immediately \"explodes\" and loses. Players can strategically use other cards they've picked up to negate an exploding kitten, or make it more likely for other players to pick one up. All of the cards feature Inman's signature Oatmeal-style drawings, and many include drawings from his past comics. \n \n Within minutes, Inman's Kickstarter campaign had raised its $10,000 goal, and an hour later, it had over $100,000.

The move infuriated Democrats and emboldened Republican nominee Donald Trump. \n \n It's impossible to know before results are tallied what impact Comey's actions -- first raising a vaguely worded red flag 11 days out, and then lowering it two days from the election -- will have on the contest. But the news could help Clinton put to rest a controversy that has dogged her in the 2016 race's closing days, helping Trump narrow a polling gap nationally and in key battleground states. \n \n Trump assailed the FBI's handling of the matter, though he did not directly address Comey's announcement at a rally in Sterling Heights, Michigan. \n \n \"You can't review 650,000 new emails in eight days. You can't do it, folks,\" Trump said, adding, \"Hillary Clinton is guilty. She knows it, the FBI knows it, the people know it, and now it's up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box on November 8.\" \n \n JUST WATCHED Cooper to Conway: Fine to speculate without facts?

The laptop which was found was about a decade old with lots of personal content on it not relevant to the investigation, according to one source. \n \n The probe is considered over with regard to Clinton. Though with not all the deleted emails recovered and not all the devices in FBI's possession, it is always possible something else could turn up that would require more review. \n \n There were some classified emails found, but law enforcement officials stressed the issue is not the classified information so much as proving intent. The sources would not specify if the the classified messages were new or duplicates of ones already reviewed, nor would would officials say how many there were and what levels at which they were classified. \n \n \"Keep in mind we are focused on intent,\" the official said. \"We know there are classified materials, but that doesn't change the conclusion reached back in July.\" \n \n As for others who were part of the probe, including Abedin, the FBI is still working on some remaining aspects of the review, including determining how the emails ended up on the laptop in the first place. Abedin's attorneys have said she doesn't know why these emails were there because this wasn't a computer she used. \n \n JUST WATCHED Who is Huma Abedin? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Who is Huma Abedin? 03:25 \n \n The expectation remains that investigators will have to talk to Abedin again. \n \n It isn't uncommon to come across new evidence after concluding a probe -- which is what happened here in October. Normally, investigators take a look to see if anything changes in their conclusions and it's not a controversial issue. This case isn't a normal case, given the election and the stakes. \n \n DOJ informed of decision \n \n Comey sent the letter as soon as possible, the senior law enforcement official said. He was \"very careful\" about how the letter was crafted given the sensitivities. \n \n Attorney General Loretta Lynch was informed ahead of time that the FBI director was sending the updated letter to Congress informing them of that there would be no change in the FBI stance on Hillary Clinton, a Justice official told CNN on Sunday. \n \n Lynch and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates disagreed with Comey's earlier decision to notify Congress. The attorney general backed Comey's move Sunday. \n \n \"Everyone is on the same page,\" the source said. \n \n Since there is no change to the original findings, the Justice Department has no need to weigh in further, the official said. \n \n \"The Department of Justice and the FBI dedicated all necessary resources to conduct this review expeditiously,\" the Justice Department said in a brief statement released Sunday afternoon. \n \n Campaigns weigh in \n \n Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said her campaign is validated in its belief that nothing would change. \n \n We were always confident nothing would cause the July decision to be revisited. Now Director Comey has confirmed ithttps://t.co/BMQQx9eRzw \u2014 Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) November 6, 2016 \n \n \"We were always confident nothing would cause the July decision to be revisited. Now Director Comey has confirmed it,\" he tweeted. \n \n The Trump campaign quickly slammed Comey. \n \n \"We thought that Director Comey and the FBI were wrong when they made their initial recommendation in July, and we think that they're wrong now,\" Trump spokesman Jason Miller told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on \"The Situation Room.\" \n \n GOP vice presidential nominee Mike Pence sought to keep the pressure on Clinton. \n \n \"Mishandling classified information is a crime,\" he said at a rally in an airport hanger in Hickory, North Carolina. \"Hillary Clinton said that she never sent or received any classified information and the director of the FBI told the Congress classified information was sent.\" \n \n In Michigan, Trump called Clinton \"the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidency of the United States.\" \n \n But the Republican nominee, who has expressed hope in the last week that the FBI's review of new emails might yield an indictment, emphasized to his supporters Sunday that Clinton is \"protected\" by powerful forces. \n \n \"Well, you have to understand it's a rigged system and she's protected,\" Trump said in Minnesota, though he offered no evidence to back up his theory. \n \n 'It opened a wound' \n \n A senior Democrat close to Clinton's campaign told CNN that \"it's impossible to fully undo the damage of the last nine days.\" \n \n Internal campaign polling, the source said, found that some independents and Republican women fled Clinton after the original Comey announcement, robbing her of a constituency that she'd hoped would turn her contest with Trump into a blowout. \n \n \"It opened a wound that cannot be quickly healed,\" the Democrat said. \n \n However, the Democrat called it a relief that the \"matter is resolved\" and said Clinton's campaign plans to \"make everyone know about\" Comey's Sunday letter. \n \n Comey's last-minute announcement gives Clinton an opportunity for an I-told-you-so moment. \n \n \"We have seen Director Comey's latest letter to the Hill,\" said Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton's communications director, speaking with reporters after the news broke. \"We are glad to see that he has found, as we were confident that he would, that he had confirmed the conclusions he reached in July and we are glad that this matter is resolved.\" \n \n Trump and his allies have seized on that announcement, using it to claim Clinton was likely to face criminal charges. \n \n \"If she were to win, it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis,\" Trump claimed Saturday night in Reno, Nevada. \"In that situation we could very well have a sitting president under felony indictment and ultimately a criminal trial. It would grind government to a halt.\" \n \n Political benefit \n \n The political benefit for Trump has been that Republicans who'd been skeptical of their party's nominee have largely followed vice presidential nominee Mike Pence's calls to \"come home\" to the party -- finding Trump less objectionable than Clinton. \n \n It's not just Trump's campaign that seized on Comey's actions. Down-ballot Republicans -- particularly Senate candidates who had been forced to answer for Trump's statements for months -- used the moment to change the topic, shifting to the more comfortable ground of attacking Clinton. \n \n The last-minute Sunday move from Comey could also provide new fuel for Trump's claims of a \"rigged\" system -- allowing him to cast the FBI director's intervention in the presidential election in a new light. \n \n Comey and the FBI went from Trump's scapegoat to the Republican nominee's hero, with Trump claiming Comey had redeemed himself just in time. \n \n Newt Gingrich, a top Trump ally, tweeted \"Comey must be under enormous political pressure to cave like this.\" \n \n Comey must be under enormous political pressure to cave like this and announce something he cant possibly know. \u2014 Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) November 6, 2016 \n \n Dems, GOP react \n \n House Speaker Paul Ryan dismissed the significance of Comey's latest letter. \n \n \"Regardless of this decision, the undisputed finding of the FBI's investigation is that Secretary Clinton put our nation's secrets at risk and in doing so compromised our national security,\" Ryan said in a statement. \"Fortunately, the American people have the opportunity to ensure Secretary Clinton never gets her hands on classified information again.\" \n \n Capitol Hill Democrats praised Comey's decision to release more information. \n \n \"While the original letter should never have been sent so close to an election, the expeditious review of these emails should put to rest -- once and for all -- the irresponsible speculation indulged in by the Trump campaign and others,\" Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee said. \"Voters can now make their decision based on the merits, and that decision should be simple: it is the choice between a woman superbly qualified to be commander in chief, and a man patently unfit for office.\" \n \n Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus issued a statement saying, \"None of this changes the fact that the FBI continues to investigate the Clinton Foundation for corruption involving her tenure as secretary of state.

    "document": "Photo \n \n It\u2019s not in the stars after all. Instead, it seems, the shape of a person\u2019s social network is a powerful signal that can identify one\u2019s spouse or romantic partner \u2014 and even if a relationship is likely to break up. \n \n So says a new research paper written by Jon Kleinberg, a computer scientist at Cornell University, and Lars Backstrom, a senior engineer at Facebook. The paper, posted online on Sunday, will be presented at a conference on social computing in February. \n \n The pair used a hefty data set from Facebook as their lab: 1.3 million Facebook users, selected randomly from among all users who are at least 20 years old, with from 50 to 2,000 friends, who list a spouse or relationship partner in their profile. That makes for a lot of social connections to analyze, roughly 379 million nodes and 8.6 billion links. The data was used anonymously. \n \n Their key finding was that the total number of mutual friends two people share \u2014 embeddedness, in social networking terms \u2014 is actually a fairly weak indicator of romantic relationships. Far better, they found, was a network measure that they call dispersion. \n \n This yardstick measures mutual friends, but also friends from the further-flung reaches of a person\u2019s network neighborhood. High dispersion occurs when a couple\u2019s mutual friends are not well connected to one another. \n \n In the graphic of one person\u2019s network neighborhood (above), the cluster at the top is the individual\u2019s co-workers. The cluster at the right is old college friends. The node (friend) in the lower left quadrant of the graphic, with links to the two dense clusters \u2014 but at a distance from those clusters \u2014 is the user\u2019s spouse. \n \n \u201cA spouse or romantic partner is a bridge between a person\u2019s different social worlds,\u201d Mr. Kleinberg explained in an interview on Sunday. \n \n Their dispersion algorithm was able to correctly identify a user\u2019s spouse 60 percent of the time, or better than a 1-in-2 chance. Since everyone in the sample had at least 50 friends, merely guessing would have at best produced a 1 in 50 chance. The algorithm also did pretty well with people who declare themselves to be \u201cin a relationship,\u201d correctly identifying them a third of the time \u2014 a 1 in 3 chance compared with the 1 in 50 for guesswork. \n \n Particularly intriguing is that when the algorithm fails, it looks as if the relationship is in trouble. A couple in a declared relationship and without a high dispersion on the site are 50 percent more likely to break up over the next two months than a couple with a high dispersion, the researchers found. (Their research tracked the users every two months for two years.) \n \n For Facebook, the research is part of its automated efforts to look more closely at the relationships among its users to tailor content and ads. Mr. Backstrom is the engineering manager in charge of Facebook\u2019s News Feed, which delivers content from a user\u2019s friends. \n \n The more Facebook knows about a user\u2019s relationships, the more appropriately tailored the News Feed can be. Do you want to see pictures of a child\u2019s swimming lesson yesterday? Probably yes, if it\u2019s from a family member or close co-worker, but probably not from someone on the fringes of your network of 2,000 \u201cfriends.\u201d \n \n So much of social-network analysis confirms what we already know. Relationships that last are ones in which the other person widens our world? Well, yes. Still, it\u2019s kind of nice to have it confirmed with lots of data and algorithms. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t had this view of it before,\u201d Mr. Kleinberg observed. ||||| It might seem reasonable then if \"embeddedness\" could be used to predict people's plus-ones. But that's not what researchers Lars Backstrom of Facebook and Jon Kleinberg of Cornell University found. In a new paper , they write that embeddedness is an at best mediocre predictor of that special something. Relying on embeddedness, they were able to accurately predict Facebook users' significant others 24.7 percent of the time. \n \n Here's what that means: The number of mutual friends (\"embeddedness\") is a reliable indicator of how close two people are. Simply put: You have more friends in common with your closest friends than with your acquaintances. \n \n Facebook data scientists have developed a novel method for identifying who among a user's friends is that person's partner\u2014and their work puts an empirical stamp on something that is perhaps intuitive: A significant other occupies a unique place in a person's social network, one characterized not by \"embeddedness\"\u2014the standard way of measuring a tie's proximity\u2014but by what the researchers call \"dispersion.\" \n \n Another measure fared much better: \"dispersion,\" or how many different networks of theirs a person's friend shares. In other words, your significant other won't just share many friends with you, but friends from all walks of life: your colleagues, your high school buds, your college friends, your family, and so on. Using dispersion, Backstrom and Kleinberg doubled their accuracy: 50 percent of the time, a person was romantic partners with the person who was the most dispersed across his or her social network. For married people, their accuracy rose to 60 percent, a figure which they say is more than 30 times higher than random guessing would produce (everyone in their sample had at least 50 friends). \n \n The researchers were able to work with their findings to produce a telling observation about the health of a given relationship: The more dispersion a relationship demonstrated, the more likely it was that that relationship would still be around 60 days later (the researchers excluded married couples from this analysis, though that would be quite interesting to see too). This is not necessarily causal (no, you can't get your girlfriend to stick around by bringing her to the company holiday party), but couples who are building a life together, as demonstrated by their multiple and interconnected social circles, seem to have more staying power. (Presumably, though no measurement tools have been developed yet, the breakups of such relationships are also the most painful.) \n \n For now, researchers relied on looking at Facebook users who identify their partners on the site, but, as this sort of analysis gets refined, it's easy to see how they could use their methodology to detect a relationship which is not quote-unquote \"Facebook official.\" Such information will be useful to Facebook in prioritizing certain people in your newsfeed, showing you those\u2014and especially the one\u2014you care most about.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Facebook data scientists can figure out who you're sleeping with, even if your relationship isn't \"Facebook official,\" and in a new paper researchers explain how they figured out the method, the Atlantic reports. Turns out the key is to look at more than just mutual friends. \"Embeddedness,\" or the number of mutual friends two people have, can show how close those people are (the more mutual friends, the closer they are). But researchers found embeddedness predicted the correct significant others just 24.7% of the time. A more accurate predictor is something called \"dispersion.\" That means researchers looked at how many networks were shared between two people, working on the theory that your romantic partner will have met your family and your current friends and co-workers, as well as old friends from high school or college. By looking at which friend was the most dispersed across all of a Facebook user's networks, researchers upped their accuracy at predicting significant others to 50%. \"A spouse or romantic partner is a bridge between a person\u2019s different social worlds,\" one researcher explains, according to the New York Times. Oh, and dispersion also works to predict the health of your relationship: The more dispersion a user had with his or her partner, the more likely the relationship was to last at least 60 days.",

At 3 p.m. EDT, Al Gore's former Current TV will turn out the lights in more than 45 million TV homes, replaced by the new U.S. affiliate of Al-Jazeera. \n \n The network has hired many veterans of U.S. television, including John Seigenthaler, Joie Chen, Antonio Mora and Sheila MacVicar, and is promising a meaty diet of news that it believes will contrast with the opinionated talk that dominates American news networks. \n \n \"We're breaking in with something that we think is unique and are confident, with our guts and some research, that the American people are looking for,\" said Kate O'Brian, the former ABC News executive who is now Al-Jazeera America's president. \n \n The dozens of flat-screen TVs and occupied desks scattered around marble pillars in AJA's New York office indicate this is no cheap startup. And this is temporary; the network is looking for a larger office in New York but wanted to start quickly after buying out Current in January. Bureaus are also being established in 11 other American cities. \n \n Until Al-Jazeera America revealed a prime-time schedule last week, there were few indications of what the network would look like. Scheduled shows include a nightly newscast anchored by Seigenthaler, a newsmagazine hosted by Chen, a news talk show with Mora and a business program starring Ali Velshi. \n \n It's still not clear what will be shown in the mornings and whether much of the broadcast day will be devoted to documentary-style programming or live news. \n \n With its domestic bureaus, AJA will seek out stories beyond the towers of New York and government buildings in Washington, said Ehab Al Shihabi, the network's interim CEO. Besides those two cities, bureaus are located in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas, Detroit, Chicago, Denver, Miami, Seattle, Nashville, Tenn., and New Orleans. \n \n \"I am here because the promise of doing good work is just exceptional,\" said David Doss, a veteran of ABC, NBC and CNN who is Al-Jazeera America's senior vice president of news programming. \n \n Al-Jazeera is well-established overseas, and the American network will take advantage of its 70 bureaus. But executives have been careful to stress that AJA will be geared toward American tastes. They have a careful line to walk: Al-Jazeera doesn't want to remind Americans of when Bush administration officials questioned its independence in the months after the terrorist attacks, and the years when American cable operators wanted nothing to do it. Tight security is evident at the New York office. A visitor last week needed to go through an airport-style metal detector and be checked by two guards. \n \n The American launch has caused some internal dissension. A memo to his bosses from Marwan Bishara, an Al-Jazeera political analyst, suggested that executives have gone too far to ingratiate themselves with a U.S. audience. \"How have we moved from the main idea that the strength of (Al-Jazeera) lies in the diversity, plurality and even accents of its journalists to a channel where only Americans work?\" Bishara wrote, his memo made public by The Guardian newspaper in England. \n \n Bishara said that asking potential viewers in a poll whether they consider Al-Jazeera to be anti-American sends a bad message. \n \n Bishara worries that Al-Jazeera will water down its journalism for an American audience, \"and nothing could be further from the truth,\" said Paul Eedle, deputy launch manager. Being bold _ not bland _ is the secret to success, he said. \n \n The Al-Jazeera English network, which has disseminated its programming online and over some widely scattered cable systems during the past decade, is generally straightforward in its news coverage, said Philip Seib, a professor of journalism and public policy at the University of Southern California, who has written a book about Al-Jazeera. \n \n \"That's what's encouraging about Al-Jazeera America,\" Seib said. A focus on technology and science-oriented programs indicate an effort to reach smart, younger viewers, he said. \n \n Dave Marash, a former Al-Jazeera English reporter, said he believes that AJA will be able to produce the solid news reporting it is counting on to distinguish itself from its competition. \n \n \"Almost all of their hires are respectable people with real careers and real records,\" Marash said. \"Several are flat-out outstanding _ Sheila MacVicar is outstanding. I'm optimistic.\" \n \n AJA will be available in less than half of American homes at its launch. The Time Warner cable system, for example, dropped Current when the sale was announced. AJA is negotiating with Time Warner and carriers like Cablevision that didn't carry Current in the first place, to get in more homes. But people at the network expect a wait-and-see period. \n \n Another handicap is the channel's location on cable systems. Current was often given a high-numbered channel that makes it much less likely that viewers would find it by chance; AJA said it is working to improve that. \n \n Even with Al-Jazeera rarely available on TV in the U.S., the Al-Jazeera English network had a substantial following online. But that will end; as a condition of being carried on cable systems, Al-Jazeera will no longer be able to send out a live Internet stream of its programming. \n \n That seems unwise, Marash said. Essentially, Al-Jazeera will be trading a young and growing audience online _ the distribution form that best represents the industry's future _ for a smaller, older television audience, he said. \n \n \"None of this makes any sense unless you talk about it in the context of ego,\" Marash said. \n \n AJA has said little about its online plans. Al Shihabi said the company's goal is to get near-universal carriage on television, making the worries about the online audience moot. \n \n \"We are not coming here to compete,\" Al Shihabi said. \"We are coming here to win.\" \n \n ___ \n \n EDITOR'S NOTE _ David Bauder can be reached at dbauder(at)ap.org or on Twitter (at)dbauder.

If the operation fulfills this claim, it will be sitting opposite the popular networks who have made their millions on this formula. \n \n Al Jazeera America will be available to nearly half of the country's 100 million television subscribers on Tuesday afternoon when it overtakes Current TV's distribution network, which it acquired in January for $500m. By taking over the station, Al Jazeera America is susceptible to the risks of having a high-numbered channel far from its competitors grouped together in the lower, more accessible, digits. \n \n American cable companies have been reluctant to include Al Jazeera in their television packages, because of what some commentators call an \"anti-American\" bias. Marwan Bishara, one of the network's most prominent journalists, voiced fears that the network will sacrifice its bold approach to assuage these criticisms in an extensive email sent to company executives in June. \n \n It also has to let go of Al Jazeera English, currently available to a small amount of US cable subscribers and to stream online until Tuesday. During crises in the Middle East, the channel and online stream are one of the few resources Americans have providing live, extensive coverage of events. \n \n During the Arab Spring, the live stream had more than 1.6m views and the network was endorsed by Hillary Clinton, then the US secretary of state, who called its coverage \"real news.\" \n \n This service will be missed as events continue to unfold in Egypt, which has seen violent unrest since president Mohammed Morsi was ousted in July. \n \n In an era of rapidly declining journalism jobs and dismal news profits, the network has built up an unusually large outfit of 900 employees \u2013 400 of whom are on the news team \u2013 an extensive network of freelancers and 12 US bureaus, with the potential for more. This is made possible by the oil-rich Qatar government, which funds the news agency. \n \n Al Jazeera representatives have said the American audience is interested in a more substantive 24-hour news network and are promising content that does just that. \n \n With only six minutes of commercials per hour \u2013 far less than the usual 16 on most US networks \u2013 Al Jazeera America will feature documentary films, a hearty online news section and a 16-person investigative reporting team. The latter is particularly unique in a country where the archetype of 24-hour cable news \u2013 CNN \u2013 recently dissolved its entire investigate team. \n \n The beta-version of their news site on Monday featured stories on Egypt, Guantanamo Bay and farm workers in Washington \u2013 the final of which has been subject to little media coverage. Al-Shihabi and company representatives have said that the intent of Al Jazeera is to create journalism in the public interest instead of \"infotainment.\" ||||| Would-be competitors at big broadcast news divisions like NBC and established cable news channels like CNN have mostly shrugged at the start-up. A senior television news executive predicted that Al Jazeera America would, at the outset, receive even lower ratings than the channel it is replacing, Current TV . \n \n Last month the lame-duck Current had about 24,000 viewers in prime time, according to Nielsen data; Fox News had 1.3 million. \n \n Al Jazeera acquired Current TV for $500 million in January to start an American channel, after trying unsuccessfully for years to win cable and satellite carriage for its English-language international news channel. \n \n But with carriage comes concessions. Since distributors discourage their partners from giving programming away on the Internet, Al Jazeera will have to block American users from the live streams of its programming that tend to be popular in periods of tumult overseas. \n \n Al Jazeera will start in about 48 million of the country\u2019s roughly 100 million homes that subscribe to television. \n \n It is in talks with Time Warner Cable , which publicly dropped Current TV upon Al Jazeera\u2019s acquisition. Meanwhile, one of Al Jazeera\u2019s overseas rivals, the British Broadcasting Corporation , continues to press for wider carriage of BBC World News in America. \n \n What is unique about Al Jazeera \u2014 its seemingly limitless financing from an oil- and gas-rich government \u2014 may be its biggest advantage and its most-remarked-upon weakness. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n With a staff of 900, including 400 newsroom employees, it is one of the most significant investments in television journalism in modern times. \n \n Photo \n \n Paul Eedle, an Al Jazeera English executive who is helping to start the channel, would not comment on the total budget, but said hundreds of millions of dollars were being spent. \u201cWe\u2019re here because we think our journalistic mission has something to offer America,\u201d he said. \n \n Many contend Qatar\u2019s geopolitical aims are a motivator, too. The Al Jazeera name still arouses deep suspicion in some Americans, mostly because of the period immediately after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, when Al Jazeera broadcast messages from Osama bin Laden and was demonized by Bush administration officials as anti-American. \n \n Al Jazeera America officials rebut questions about whether its brand name will hurt its chances on cable by invoking other foreign brands, like Honda , that are now viewed favorably in the United States. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Some of them, like John Seigenthaler, had left the business and said they thought they would not take another job in television, until Al Jazeera came along. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n \u201cThey said: \u2018We want to do real news. We want to give it context and perspective and make it balanced and in-depth.\u2019 I thought, \u2018Gee, this is a dream come true,\u2019 \u201d he said. \n \n Mr. Seigenthaler (the anchor of the weekend editions of \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d until 2007) will kick off prime time at 8 p.m. with a straightforward newscast. \u201cAmerica Tonight,\u201d a newsmagazine, will follow at 9 p.m. It will be hosted by Joie Chen (a CBS News correspondent until 2008), and has been billed as Al Jazeera\u2019s flagship program. Antonio Mora (a former \u201cGood Morning America\u201d news anchor who spent the last 10 years at local stations) will take over at 10 p.m. with a talk show called \u201cConsider This.\u201d \n \n Al Jazeera\u2019s approach \u2014 more time for more serious journalism \u2014 is an implicit criticism of the other options for news on television. \n \n Mr. Mora said he had sensed far less commercial pressure at Al Jazeera than at local stations where he had worked. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense here of the news being a public trust,\u201d he said. \n \n None of the anchors said they had felt any slant in coverage plans, pro-Qatar or otherwise, despite accounts from some former Al Jazeera English employees of interference from above. \n \n In interviews, the anchors made offhand remarks that it is hard to imagine counterparts at other networks making. For instance, Ms. Chen asked: \u201cHow big does our audience need to be? I don\u2019t know. Nobody talks about that here.\u201d \n \n She was scheduled to be in South Dakota over the weekend, filing stories from an Indian reservation. \n \n \u201cThat\u2019s not even a pitch I would have made in my old newsroom,\u201d she said, because of budget limitations. \u201cHere, we never have any debate about resources,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like this: \u2018Is that a good story?\u2019 \u2018Yes, it\u2019s a good story.\u2019 \u2018Then go tell it.\u2019 \u201d",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Al Jazeera America launches this afternoon, and while some analysts believe the channel's entry to cable line-ups is a development as important as the launch of CNN or the Fox News Channel, others wonder if the new channel and its formula of serious, in-depth news will ever be able to attract more than a handful of viewers. The channel has decided to focus heavily on US news, and its \"seemingly limitless financing\" from the Qatari government may be \"its biggest strength and its most remarked-upon weakness,\" writes Brian Stelter at the New York Times. With 900 staff, it is \"one of the most significant investments in TV journalism in modern times,\" he notes. The channel has bureaus in New York City; Washington, DC; Los Angeles; San Francisco; Dallas; Detroit; Chicago; Denver; Miami; Seattle; Nashville; and New Orleans. The channel's chief executive has promised \"less opinion, less yelling, and fewer celebrity sightings,\" reports the Guardian, which notes that its 16-person investigative team sets it apart from peers like CNN, which recently ditched its entire investigative team. Advertisers, however, seem wary, and AJA will start out with just six minutes of commercials per hour.

I'm optimistic.\" Other major hires include John Seigenthaler, Joie Chen, and Antonio Mora.

    "document": "Hillary Clinton joins the race for president today. If you believe the leaks from her staff, and there\u2019s no reason you shouldn\u2019t, she\u2019ll do it in a video released at noon as she herself flies high above the nation in a chartered plane. She and her top advisors, all smart people, must think it\u2019s a good idea. It doesn\u2019t feel like one. \n \n For months Clinton has run a front-porch campaign -- if by porch you mean Boo Radley\u2019s. Getting her outdoors is hard enough; when she does get out it\u2019s often to give paid speeches to people who look just like her: educated, prosperous and privileged. Needing desperately to connect with the broader public, she opts for the virtual reality of a pre-taped video delivered via social media. Go figure. \n \n Her leakers say she\u2019ll head out on a listening tour like the one that kicked off her first Senate race. They say listening to real people talk about real stuff will make her seem more real. This too may be a good idea, but it made more sense when she was a rookie candidate seeking a lesser office in a state she barely knew. Running for president is different. So are the times. Voters are more desperate now, and in a far worse mood. If you invite their questions, you\u2019d better have some answers. I\u2019ll return to this point shortly. \n \n Her leakers say she\u2019ll avoid big events, rallies, stadiums, that sort of thing. This is about 2008, when she and her tone-deaf team seemed to be planning a coronation. This time they say she doesn\u2019t want to come off as quite so presumptuous. Yet next week she keynotes a \u2018Global Women\u2019s Summit\u2019 cohosted by Tina Brown and the New York Times, at which \u201cworld leaders, industry icons, movie stars and CEOs convene with artists, rebels, peacemakers and activists to tell their stories and share their plans of action.\u201d Orchestra seats go for $300. \n \n Clinton personifies the meritocracy that to an angry middle class looks increasingly like just another privileged caste. It\u2019s the anger captured best by the old \u2018Die Yuppie Scum\u2019 posters and in case you haven\u2019t noticed, it\u2019s on the rise. Republicans love to paint Democrats as elitists. It\u2019s how the first two Bushes took out Dukakis, Gore and Kerry -- and how Jeb plans to take out Hillary. When she says she and Bill were broke when they left the White House; when she sets her own email rules and says it was only for her own convenience; when she hangs out with the Davos, Wall Street or Hollywood crowds, she makes herself a more inviting target. \n \n During its long ramp-up, Democrats searched for signs that this Clinton campaign would be better than the last, a seething cauldron of rivalries and resentments run by D.C. consultants who made their real livings from corporate clients. Things do look better at the top. The chief of staff is John Podesta, a man whose core competency is competency. Pollster Joel Benenson is a huge step up from the fiercely anti-populist Mark Penn. \n \n Still, the leaks are a bad sign. All campaigns fall prey to them and it\u2019s sometimes a good thing for the First Amendment that they do. All White House staffs leak to settle scores or advance agendas and careers. Bill Clinton\u2019s White House added a new wrinkle -- leaks that elevated the leaker at Clinton\u2019s expense. Often the leaker wanted only to prove his insider status and savvy; the result was to frame everything Clinton did as political even before he did it. Every modern president polled as much as Clinton but none was so scorned for it. Leakers had a lot to do with that. \n \n All political reportage is full of insider tales about how every link of sausage is made. When House Democrats resumed their push for a minimum wage hike, staff framed the initiative not as sound policy but as clever politics. Even if authorized, nearly all such leaks harm the principle. On Friday, Clinton\u2019s campaign let slip its aim to raise $2.5 billion; maybe that's not the best way to say hello to a struggling middle class. Someone gabbed about the message of Hillary\u2019s planned sit downs with average families, a sure fire way to make the families look and feel like props -- and to make the whole, hollow exercise look and feel like a hollow exercise. \n \n There are three problems that go far deeper than Hillary\u2019s image or her campaign\u2019s operations. Each is endemic to our current politics; all are so deeply connected as to be inseparable. You already know them. The first is how they raise their money. The second is how they craft their message. The third pertains to policy. \n \n To get the money they think they need candidates who crook the knee to moneyed interests. They spend vast sums on polls, focus groups and data mining to find out what messages to send and to whom, and vaster sums to send them. The need to serve their donors keeps them from solving real problems. With so little to show for their service, they must rely even more on paid propaganda. The emptier their ads, the more of them they need. \n \n The first thing to know about this system is how well it works for Republicans, most of whom would back the status quo with or without the money. Since they can\u2019t afford to be too honest about policy anyway, consultants\u2019 metaphors and themes suit them fine, as do the strict limitations of texts, tweets and ads. \n \n The opposite is true for Democrats. When they truckle to the status quo, they break sacred vows. Their base feels most betrayed ,but everyone notices and no one likes what they see. Convinced by their consultants that politics is all about metaphors and emotion, they treat issues as landmines and do everything possible to avoid stepping on one. They skip real debates to pursue what Obama consigliere David Axelrod calls \u2018the politics of biography.\u2019 Trading real reform for public policy vaporware, they lose all sense of purpose -- and eventually stop making sense. \n \n On Friday, Clinton\u2019s campaign began the quick, quiet buildup to her Sunday announcement by placing a new epilogue to her last memoir in the Huffington Post. It\u2019s mostly about how being a grandmother gives her new energy and insight. At the end of the piece she says it also inspires her to work hard so every child has as good a chance in life as her new granddaughter has. Her recent speeches, even those her leakers tout as campaign previews, say little more than that. \n \n Barring a Jeremiah Wright-level crisis, a presidential candidate gets just two or three chances to make her case to a big audience. Her announcement is often her best shot. That Hillary passed on hers is unsettling. If she thinks she doesn\u2019t have to make her case real soon she\u2019s wrong. If she thinks she can get by on the sort of mush Democratic consultants push on clients she\u2019s finished. On Thursday the Q poll released three surveys. In two states, she now trails Rand Paul. In all three a plurality or majority said she is \u2018not honest or trustworthy.\u2019 You can bet the leak about her $2.5 billion campaign will push those negatives up a notch. \n \n Clinton seems as disconnected from the public mood now as she did in 2008. I think it\u2019s a crisis. If she doesn\u2019t right the ship it will be a disaster. In politics it\u2019s always later than you think. Advisors who told her voters would forget the email scandals probably say this too will pass. If so, she should fire them. \n \n Leaders as progressive as Howard Dean and Barney Frank urge Democrats to circle the wagons and spare the party the bloodshed of a real contest, but this party needs to get its blood moving. Clinton needs a real challenge and a real debate, not just a sparring partner; not some palooka to dance her around the ring for a couple of rounds, but a real fighter. She needs the debate. We all do. But who will bring it? \n \n Underdogs always need to get an early start, so it\u2019s surprising that Clinton beat all of her prospective primary opponents into the race. Some seem to be auditioning for the second spot on her ticket. Others may not make the race. If no champion emerges, progressives must mount their own debate and relearn some of the skills they applied so successfully back in the days before everybody had a PAC. \n \n The Democrats' third problem is policy. They don\u2019t really have clear policies to deal with our biggest problems. It\u2019s why Hillary won\u2019t have the answers those Iowa families seek and why so few Democrats do. It\u2019s why we need a real debate. It is Clinton\u2019s misfortune to find herself master of a dying system. \n \n If she raises all that money it will ruin her. Fundraising nearly ruined her husband in 1996. He didn\u2019t need all the money he raised then and God knows she doesn\u2019t need all the money she wants to raise now. Even if raising the money doesn\u2019t land her in hot water, if she spends it the way most Democrats do, that will ruin her. \n \n Like Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 race, this election is about the economy. But this one\u2019s about how to reform the economy, not just jumpstart it. Our political system isn\u2019t set up to debate whether or not our economic system needs real reform. It will take a very different kind of politics, and leader, to spark that debate. We\u2019ll soon know whether anyone is ready, willing and able to fight. \n \n Bill Curry Bill Curry was White House counselor to President Clinton and a two-time Democratic nominee for governor of Connecticut.

You can find Democrats boasting about their \u201cblue wall\u201d in the Electoral College and how hard this will make it for any Republican to win. Or Republicans warning that the Democratic Party rarely wins three elections in a row. \n \n Most of this analysis is flimsy. So is the commentary about the ups-and-downs in early swing state polls. And when you see some pundit declaring a minor misstep to be a \u201cgame changer,\u201d find someone else to follow on Twitter. \n \n The truth is that a general election win by Clinton \u2014 she\u2019s very likely to become the Democratic nominee \u2014 is roughly a 50/50 proposition. And we\u2019re not likely to learn a lot over the rest of 2015 to change that. Here\u2019s why: \n \n Incumbency and Obama\u2019s Approval Rating. Start with the fact that there\u2019s no incumbent president running. There actually haven\u2019t been a lot of cases that precisely meet the circumstances voters will face next year: Barack Obama, assuming he serves out the rest of his term, will become just the fifth president limited by the 22nd Amendment from seeking an additional term in office. Still, the evidence we have from presidential elections and from other contexts like gubernatorial elections is that these cases default to being toss-ups. \n \n Clinton\u2019s chances will be affected by Obama\u2019s popularity as he exits office. The relationship between the popularity of the previous president and the performance of the new nominee from his party isn\u2019t perfect \u2014 Al Gore (narrowly) lost in 2000 despite Bill Clinton\u2019s popularity, for example \u2014 but it certainly matters some, especially given that Clinton served in Obama\u2019s cabinet. \n \n However, Obama currently has an approval rating of about 45 percent, and a favorability rating of 48 percent \u2014 about average, in other words. If those numbers decline into the low 40s or climb into the 50s, they could matter more, producing either a \u201changover effect\u201d or \u201chalo effect\u201d for Clinton. But don\u2019t bet on this: Obama\u2019s approval ratings have been extraordinarily stubborn for most of his presidency, rarely deviating much from the mid-40s. \n \n The Economy. I\u2019d warn against simplistic economic \u201cfundamentalism,\u201d the notion that the economy is pretty much the only thing that matters. We\u2019ll save the technical discussion for later, but because of a problem known as overfitting, statistical models that claim to make remarkably precise predictions about election outcomes from economic variables alone (without looking at polls) have a mediocre track record. \n \n Still, the economy will matter a lot to voters, and a better economy will help Clinton, the candidate from the incumbent party. As Byron York points out, you should be wary of claims that 2016 will be a \u201cforeign policy election.\u201d \n \n Like Obama\u2019s approval ratings, however, the performance of the American economy has been about average recently. GDP grew by 2.4 percent in 2014, adjusted for inflation, close to the historical average. Furthermore, we know relatively little about what economic growth will look like a year from now, when the general election campaign heats up. Historically, economists have shown almost no ability to predict the rate of economic growth more than six months in advance. \n \n The Electoral College And The \u201cEmerging Democratic Majority.\u201d What about that \u201cblue wall\u201d \u2014 the supposed advantage that Democrats hold in the Electoral College? \n \n Mostly, the \u201cblue wall\u201d was the effect of Obama\u2019s success in 2008 and 2012, not the cause of it. If the economy had collapsed in the summer of 2012, Obama would probably have lost the election, and most of those blue states would have turned red. \n \n It\u2019s true that in both elections, the \u201ctipping-point state\u201d (in both years it was Colorado) was slightly more Democratic than the country as a whole. That implies Obama would have won if the popular vote had been very close. But it would have had to be very close indeed \u2014 within a percentage point or two. \n \n That advantage is small enough that it might have been the result of circumstances peculiar to Obama and his campaign. If Clinton has an ever-so-slightly different coalition \u2014 say more working-class whites vote for her but fewer African-Americans \u2014 this small advantage could evaporate or reverse itself. (The Electoral College favored Republicans as recently as 2000, after all.) The same might be true if she isn\u2019t as effective as Obama at mobilizing voters in swing states. \n \n Another theory \u2014 the so-called \u201cEmerging Democratic Majority\u201d \u2014 holds that demographic trends favor the Democratic Party. We\u2019ll have a lot more to say about this theory between now and next November, but it\u2019s probably dubious too. As Sean Trende has pointed out, it relies on a selective reading of the evidence \u2014 emphasizing 2012, 2008 and 2006 but ignoring 2014, 2010, and 2004. Perhaps more important, predictions made on the premise of \u201cemerging\u201d majorities have a miserable track record: Republicans were bragging about their \u201cpermanent\u201d majority in 2004, for instance, only to get their butts kicked in 2006 and 2008. \n \n Clinton and the Republican Candidates. The factors I\u2019ve described so far are sometimes referred to as the \u201cfundamentals\u201d \u2014 those things that matter regardless of the candidates and their campaigns. The closer these basic factors are, the more difference the candidates could make. \n \n Nonetheless, the candidates matter less in U.S. presidential elections than in just about any other type of electoral contest. The reason is that the arduous, 50-state nomination process (and the \u201cinvisible primary\u201d before it) screens out most candidates who would be huge liabilities to their party. An underqualified or unvetted or politically extreme or profoundly unpopular candidate might win one primary or caucus, but voters and the political parties will move to stop him in his tracks after that, as Republicans did to Newt Gingrich in 2012. \n \n Consider the three measurable factors that our U.S. Senate model uses to evaluate candidates. One of them is their qualifications on a 4-point scale as measured by their highest elected office, where the highest rating goes to those candidates previously elected as governors or senators. Almost all presidential candidates \u2014 including Hillary Clinton and the viable Republican candidates this cycle \u2014 rate as extremely well qualified by that standard. \n \n Another factor is fundraising, which is important unto itself, but also as a proxy for a candidate\u2019s organizational strength. We\u2019re not breaking any news here, but Clinton and the Republican nominee are going to raise oodles of money \u2014 probably in excess of $1 billion each, beyond what Obama and Mitt Romney did in 2012. That\u2019s well past the point of diminishing returns. The candidates may struggle to make good use of all the money they\u2019ve raised, in fact, and if one brings in 10 or 20 percent more than the other, it\u2019s not likely to matter very much at the margin. \n \n The third factor is a candidate\u2019s ideology as measured on a left-right scale. \u201cExtreme\u201d candidates (like Barry Goldwater) suffer an electoral penalty, while moderate ones (like Dwight Eisenhower) usually perform well. \n \n But nominees like Goldwater (or George McGovern) are rare. So are those like Eisenhower, for that matter. Usually a party nominates a candidate closer to the median of its voters and elected officials. \n \n That\u2019s part of why Clinton is such a safe bet to be the Democratic nominee. Her political positions are essentially those of a \u201cgeneric Democrat.\u201d She\u2019s neither a true centrist, nor extremely far to the left, so she\u2019s not especially vulnerable to a challenge from either flank of her party. \n \n Republicans have a choice between more moderate and more conservative candidates. Jeb Bush\u2019s positions might be just moderate enough to give Republicans a slight advantage next November, other factors held constant, while Scott Walker\u2019s might be conservative enough that they could harm Republicans. \n \n But the positions of the Republican candidates are likely to converge toward one another. Bush, in the primaries, will seek to prove his conservative credentials, while Walker, should he become the frontrunner after the first few primaries and caucuses, will work to reassure GOP elites that he\u2019s an \u201celectable\u201d alternative and not the next Goldwater. By next November, the difference might boil down to the equivalent of couple of percentage points on the general-election ballot. It could matter in an a close election, but not one where the fundamentals have shifted strongly to one party by then. \n \n Finally we can look at what the polls say right now. If you\u2019re going to do this, you should take the polls with whole tablespoons full of salt. And it\u2019s probably best to look at the favorability ratings for each candidate rather than head-to-head polls, since favorability polls allow voters to say they don\u2019t know enough about the candidates to have formulated an opinion. (Head-to-head polls taken this far out from the election will tend to favor candidates like Clinton with strong name recognition, by contrast.) \n \n In the chart below, I\u2019ve compiled favorability rating averages for each candidate based on polls conducted since Jan. 1. The chart plots the candidates in two dimensions: the vertical axis indicates how popular the candidate is (how much the candidate\u2019s favorable rating exceeds his or her unfavorable rating) while the horizontal axis plots how well-known the candidate is. \n \n Hillary Clinton is extremely well-known, but her favorability ratings are now only break-even: 46 percent favorable and 45 percent unfavorable. These are nearly identical to President Obama\u2019s ratings, which are 48 percent favorable and 46 percent unfavorable. \n \n Clinton\u2019s ratings are down sharply from her tenure as Secretary of State. However, as we\u2019ve been warning Democrats for a long time, a lot of this was predictable. Clinton\u2019s numbers have often been about break-even when she\u2019s been a highly partisan figure \u2014 during the early stages of the 2008 campaign, for example \u2014 and better only when she\u2019s been above the fray of day-to-day partisan politics. \n \n Break-even favorability ratings don\u2019t look so bad, however, when compared to some of the alternatives. Vice President Biden\u2019s are net-negative, for instance. On the Republican side, Walker and Marco Rubio aren\u2019t all that well-known yet, but their ratings are also about break-even. Chris Christie\u2019s are terrible (28 percent favorable, 46 percent unfavorable). Jeb Bush\u2019s are quite poor too. His unfavorable rating is already as high as Clinton\u2019s, 45 percent, but his favorable rating is just 31 percent. \n \n Clinton is so well-known, in fact, that it\u2019s almost as if voters are dispensing with all the formalities and evaluating her as they might when she\u2019s on the ballot next November. About half of them would like to see her become president and about half of them wouldn\u2019t. Get ready for an extremely competitive election. \n \n Editor\u2019s note: This article was updated to reflect Clinton\u2019s announcement of her candidacy this afternoon. ||||| Hillary Clinton, probably your 45th president. Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images \n \n Unless the economy goes into a recession over the next year and a half, Hillary Clinton is probably going to win the presidential election. The United States has polarized into stable voting blocs, and the Democratic bloc is a bit larger and growing at a faster rate. \n \n Of course, not everybody who follows politics professionally believes this. Many pundits feel the Democrats\u2019 advantage in presidential elections has disappeared, or never existed. \u201cThe 2016 campaign is starting on level ground,\u201d argues David Brooks, echoing a similar analysis by John Judis. But the evidence for this is quite slim, and a closer look suggests instead that something serious would have to change in order to prevent a Clinton victory. Here are the basic reasons why Clinton should be considered a presumptive favorite: \n \n 1. The Emerging Democratic Majority is real. The major disagreement over whether there is an \u201cEmerging Democratic Majority\u201d \u2014 the thesis that argues that Democrats have built a presidential majority that could only be defeated under unfavorable conditions \u2014 centers on an interpretive disagreement over the 2014 elections. Proponents of this theory dismiss the midterm elections as a problem of districting and turnout; Democrats have trouble rousing their disproportionately young, poor supporters to the polls in a non-presidential year, and the tilted House and Senate map further compounded the GOP advantage. \n \n Skeptics of the theory instead believe that the 2014 midterms were, as Judis put it, \u201cnot an isolated event but rather the latest manifestation of a resurgent Republican coalition.\u201d Voters, they argue, are moving toward the Republican Party, and may continue to do so even during the next presidential election. \n \n It has been difficult to mediate between the two theories, since the outcome at the polls supports the theory of both the proponents and the skeptics of the Emerging Democratic Majority theory equally well. \n \n A Pew survey released this week gives us the best answer. Pew is the gold standard of political polling, using massive surveys, with high numbers of respondents and very low margins of error. Pew\u2019s survey shows pretty clearly that there was not a major change in public opinion from the time of Obama\u2019s reelection through the 2014 midterms: \n \n Of course, Pew is not surveying actual voters. It\u2019s surveying all adults. But that is the point. What changed between 2012 and 2014 was not public opinion, but who showed up to vote. \n \n 2. No, youngsters are not turning Republican. The Emerging Democratic Majority thesis places a lot of weight on cohort replacement: Republicans fare best with the oldest voters, and Democrats with the youngest, so every new election cycle incrementally tilts the electoral playing field toward the Democrats. \n \n Skeptics have pushed back by claiming that the youngest voters \u2014 the ones entering their voting years since 2008 \u2014 are turning back toward the Republican Party. Their main evidence has been pollings of millennial voters by the Harvard Institute of Politics. Conservatives have given these results a great deal of attention \u2014 it suggests that the youngest voters, disillusioned by the Obama administration, have abandoned the liberal tendencies of their older brothers and sisters. But Harvard\u2019s polling has not held up well; it predicted millennial voters would support a Republican Congress in 2014, which turned out to be extremely inaccurate. \n \n Pew\u2019s more recent survey combs through the data and throws more cold water on the \u201cyounger millennials\u201d thesis. As Nate Cohn notices, younger millennials lean Democratic at nearly the same rate as older ones: \n \n (Cohn does note that younger nonwhite millennials seem less Democratic than older nonwhite millennials, but young whites are far more Democratic than older ones, making the trade somewhat of a wash.) \n \n 3. Clinton isn\u2019t that unpopular. A more recent line of thought has settled on Clinton\u2019s limits as a candidate. It is probably true that she lacks Obama\u2019s talents as a communicator and a campaign organizer. A recent Quinnipiac poll showing her struggling in Iowa and Colorado attracted wide media attention and seemed to confirm that the email scandal has tarnished Clinton\u2019s national image. \n \n It is true that Clinton has, inevitably, lost much of the popularity she won when she was serving as secretary of State and largely removed from partisan politics. Nonpartisan figures can attract broad support, while people engaged in political fights tend to revert toward the mean. Clinton\u2019s support is, as it has been through most of her career, closely divided: \n \n On the other hand, Republicans are much less popular. Jeb Bush, who is probably the best known of the Republican contenders, has much worse favorable ratings: \n \n So there is little reason to think Clinton\u2019s personal unpopularity will hold her back in a race against a Republican who is likely to have no more personal appeal, and possibly a lot less. \n \n 4. Obama is trending up. One major question looming over the next election is whether the public feels satisfied with the Democrats\u2019 policy direction or wants to give Republicans a chance. Importantly, President Obama\u2019s job approval ratings have recovered since the midterm elections, when his net approval stood at minus ten, to about minus three. His approval ratings on handling the economy have risen even more sharply. Approval of Obama\u2019s economic job performance has actually reached parity with disapproval for the first time since 2009: \n \n If the economy continues to expand between now and the 2016 election, Obama\u2019s approval rating will probably rise a little higher. In the modern political world, strong popularity is not necessary to win; Obama won reelection with approval ratings below 50 percent. Voters make comparative choices, and all a candidate needs is to be superior to the alternative. But the economy is currently on a course, barring a slowdown, to leave the incumbent party in a stronger position. \n \n 5. Is it time for a change? The one remaining ground for Republican optimism is the possibility that voters will decide three straight presidential terms for the Democratic Party is too much. Many political scientists (such as Alan Abramowitz) believe this exhaustion factor is real; after a second term, voters grow increasingly restless with the in-party and are more likely to decide it\u2019s time for a change. If this is true, Clinton may face headwinds even in an otherwise favorable landscape. \n \n It may well be true. But there are reasons to doubt it. One reason is that models that detect voter impatience are based on a very small number of data points. Since World War II, there have been eight presidential elections in which the incumbent party has held office for two terms or more. It\u2019s hard to draw definitive conclusions from such a limited number of events. \n \n A second reason is that nearly all of those elections took place in a very different kind of party system. The 20th century was a time of loose-knit parties with a great deal of ideological overlap. There were liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats, which created large constituencies to swing back and forth. Democrats won more than 60 percent of the vote in the 1964 election, and then Republicans did the same eight years later. That made sense in a world where the two parties seemed to share a lot of common assumptions. Voters who supported Lyndon Johnson in 1964 weren\u2019t crazy to switch to Richard Nixon in 1972; Nixon had established the Environmental Protection Agency and supported universal health care and a basic income. \n \n The polarized electorate of today is a different place, and voters may not act the same way as they used to. There are fewer swing voters, and therefore conditions like a third straight term, or even a severe recession, may not budge as many of them from their normal partisan habits. We don\u2019t know how deeply the partisan split has hardened into place; each party seems to be able to count on the support of at least 45 percent of the voters regardless of what is happening in the world. \n \n 6. There\u2019s no alternative. All of the above brings us back to the central challenge facing Clinton. She cannot promise her supporters a dramatic change or new possibilities; she is personally too familiar, and the near certainty of at least one Republican-controlled chamber of Congress suggests continued legislative stalemate. Her worry is that ennui sets in among the base and yields a small electorate more like the kind that shows up at the midterms, which is an electorate Republicans can win. \n \n The argument for Clinton in 2016 is that she is the candidate of the only major American political party not run by lunatics. There is only one choice for voters who want a president who accepts climate science and rejects voodoo economics, and whose domestic platform would not engineer the largest upward redistribution of resources in American history. Even if the relatively sober Jeb Bush wins the nomination, he will have to accommodate himself to his party\u2019s barking-mad consensus. She is non-crazy America\u2019s choice by default. And it is not necessarily an exciting choice, but it is an easy one, and a proposition behind which she will probably command a majority.",

A sampling of what the pundits are saying: In New York, Jonathan Chait argues that \"the United States has polarized into stable voting blocs, and the Democratic bloc is a bit larger and growing at a faster rate.\" That should put Clinton in the White House, though it's not guaranteed. \"She cannot promise her supporters a dramatic change or new possibilities,\" Chait notes. \"Her worry is that ennui sets in among the base and yields a small electorate more like the kind that shows up at the midterms, which is an electorate Republicans can win.\" But at Salon, a former aide for Bill Clinton is concerned about his wife's strategy so far. \"Republicans love to paint Democrats as elitists.

Silver questions the so-called \"Emerging Democratic Majority\" that plays a role in Chait's thinking. Right now, Clinton's favorability ratings are \"break-even,\" and she's \"so well-known \u2026 that it\u2019s almost as if voters are dispensing with all the formalities and evaluating her as they might when she\u2019s on the ballot next November.

It takes something pretty special to grab attention during a season when one valedictorian got a nationally televised do-over after his school banned him from coming out in his address, and everyone from President Obama to Matthew McConaughey, Bill Nye, Ed Helms and Stephen Colbert have been lighting up stages. \n \n So, Colin Yost knew he needed to up his game. The valedictorian at Portsmouth High School in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, pulled off one for the ages on Friday, when he ended his inspirational speech by saying, \"all you have to do it shake it off.\" \n \n He then stepped back and began shaking it as Taylor Swift's hit came on over the gym's loudspeakers. \n \n \"I've always wanted to do a flash mob and I thought graduation would be the perfect place because our class is very cohesive and doesn't really have a lot of cliques,\" Yost told MTV News on Monday morning, while taking a break from his job as an assistant in a cardiovascular operating room at a Portsmouth hospital. \n \n \"I was listening to 'Shake It Off' in the car and I thought that would be great for a flash mob so I talked to a few of my friends about making it happen.\" One friend, a stage manager, handled the music, while two others with dance experience helped choreograph the whole thing. \n \n They put together an instructional video for the class that they shared privately on YouTube and then got the administration on board, who said they were fine with the plan as long as Yost and his 230+ classmates could actually pull it off. They even let the seniors use five scheduled graduation rehearsals to get the routine right. \n \n \"As we practiced, the energy was just building and everyone was feeling how great it was to work together and send this positive message,\" Yost said. \n \n Following his funny, touching speech about embracing your inner nerd and striving for perfection in anything you're passionate about, Yost started the dance alone, which was (purposely) awkward. \"My parents and a lot of other parents didn't know, so at the end of my speech half were laughing and some where like, 'oh gosh, what is he doing?'\" \n \n But then, little by little, the front row joined in, then another row and the looks of confusion and fear turned into laughter and tears from the families as pretty soon the routine turned the class of '15 into an undulating sea of maroon and white caps and gowns. \n \n Yost, who wants to be a heart surgeon, is headed to Princeton in the fall, where he plans to major in chemical and biological engineering. \n \n And, in case you were wondering. \"No, I've never taken dance lessons.\" ||||| Published on Jun 14, 2015 \n \n First line got cut off: \"One of the many unspoken social rules of middle school was to never, ever associate...\" \n \n Portsmouth High School (NH) Class of 2015 Graduation ||||| PORTSMOUTH \u2014 Graduation ceremonies, no matter how important, are often drawn-out affairs with little to break the ceremonial monotony. \n \n A few friends at Portsmouth High School decided to change that. \n \n Spearheaded by valedictorian Colin Yost, the class of roughly 235 students successfully performed a flash mob to Taylor Swift\u2019s pop tune \u201cShake It Off,\u201d shocking the audience and eventually going viral once MTV came calling. \n \n The video had been viewed on YouTube more than 270,000 times by Tuesday afternoon.

Five marching practices were used to get the timing and movements correct. \n \n \u201cAbout three weeks before graduation, I woke up at 3 a.m. to a text from Colin asking me to help with choreography for a graduation flash mob,\u201d Head said, adding she started watching the Swift music video and mapping out a dance routine. \n \n There was difficulty crafting a suitable routine, as all the graduates were sitting. The students decided that having different sections jump in would help with the display. \n \n \u201cWe played around with some moves,\u201d Head said. \u201cWe knew the front row was the class council, so we could get up and move around.\u201d \n \n The other important detail was hitting the music cue, which was where the administration finally came into play. \n \n \u201cWe hadn\u2019t planned on telling administration,\u201d Yost said. \n \n But as each senior would be on the auditorium floor, someone was needed to start the song. \n \n \u201cAt first they were against it,\u201d said Gagne. \u201cBut we told them to listen to us and we showed them our plan.\u201d \n \n The students presented detailed outlines of the entire performance to the administration, complete with white board diagrams and a sneak peek at the dance by Yost himself. \n \n As Yost finished his speech \u2014 the ending words were \u201cAll you have to do, is shake it off\u201d \u2014 he broke out into dance as looks of shock and surprise come over faces in the audience. \u201cIt was such a great moment ending the speech, hearing the music play and then dancing awkwardly,\u201d Yost said. \n \n While the moment was meant to be light-hearted and fun, Yost said the song and dance routine summed up exactly what he was talking about in his valedictory address: To embrace your inner nerd. \n \n \u201cThe goal was to basically try to go viral and send a positive message, not about Portsmouth High School and the Class of 2015, but life in general,\u201d said Yost, who will attend Princeton University this fall. \u201cMy speech leading up to the flash mob is about embracing your inner nerd and being proud of who you are. The song aligns with that.\u201d \n \n Yost and the other students didn\u2019t expect much hoopla in the aftermath, but they did start to notice when Facebook videos of the event from a teacher and parent started to creep into the tens of thousands of views. \n \n \u201cAfter just a couple nights, two Facebook videos had more than 10,000 views separately, so that was shocking.\u201d \n \n Yost said the videos spread around a little bit more before he received an email from a writer for MTV.com asking to talk to him about the flash mob. \n \n \u201cI was thrilled and shocked,\u201d Yost said. \u201cI called them, talked for a few minutes and once that article was posted, it exploded.\u201d \n \n article became the top-trending story on Thebecame the top-trending story on MTV.com later Monday evening, and has been shared across Facebook more than 50,000 times. \n \n Yost, who works as an assistant support personnel in the cardiovascular operating room at Portsmouth Regional Hospital, said it\u2019s a memory that will stay with him forever.",

File Photo by Keizo Mori/UPI | License Photo \n \n Dec. 26 (UPI) -- One of the North Korean soldiers who defected to the South in 2017 was found to have antibodies in his bloodstream, a sign Pyongyang possesses anthrax, the acute disease caused by bacteria. \n \n South Korean authorities did not identify the soldier, who was either exposed to or vaccinated for anthrax, but did confirm he had developed immunity to the deadly disease before he defected, local news network Channel A reported Tuesday. \n \n \"Anthrax antibodies have been found in the North Korean soldier who defected this year,\" a South Korean intelligence official told the network on the condition of anonymity. \n \n The discovery of the antibodies is causing concern in Seoul. \n \n The disease can kill at least 80 percent of those who are exposed to the bacterium in 24 hours, unless antibiotics are taken or vaccination is available. \n \n But South Korea's military has yet to secure an anthrax vaccine. \n \n Defense Ministry spokeswoman Choi Hyun-soo has said an anthrax \"vaccine is expected to be developed by the end of 2019,\" but not sooner, for the South Korean military. \n \n North Korea has been suspected of developing biological weapons after the regime publicized the works of the Pyongyang Biological Technology Research Institute in 2015, run by the Korean People's Army Unit 810. \n \n Pyongyang claimed the facility specializes in pesticide research but analysts have said dual-use equipment on the site suggests biological weapons are being manufactured in North Korea. \n \n The news of possible North Korea anthrax development comes at a time when South Korean newsmagazine Sisa Journal is reporting the U.S. military in the South has continued to test live bacteria at local bases. \n \n The Joint United States Forces Korea Portal and Integrated Threat Recognition, or JUPITR, is budgeted to receive about $9 million, according to the report. \n \n The program, aimed to shape biological detection capabilities, is ongoing, according to Sisa. \n \n Concerns spiked in South Korea after Seoul's defense ministry confirmed the U.S. military in South Korea imported samples of anthrax 15 times since 2009, and a shipment in 2015 exposed as many as 22 people.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Blood tests on at least one of the North Korean soldiers that defected to the South this year have detected something extremely concerning, according to a South Korean TV channel. Channel A, citing an unnamed South Korean military source, says anthrax antibodies were detected in the soldier, suggesting Pyongyang could be ramping up its biological weapon capabilities, UPI reports. According to Channel A, South Korean authorities have confirmed that the soldier is immune to the deadly bacterium, though it's not clear whether his immunity comes from vaccination or exposure. Anthrax can kill within 24 hours if people are not vaccinated, the International Business Times notes, and the South Korean military says its anthrax vaccine will not be ready until the end of 2019. The news adds to concerns about possible biological attacks: The White House released a report last week that said Pyongyang had spent \"hundreds of millions of dollars on nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons that could threaten our homeland,\" and Japan's Asahi newspaper recently reported that North Korea has been trying to find ways for anthrax to survive the high temperatures that intercontinental ballistic missiles experience.",

One year on CJ's ashes have been taken to more than 100 countries and have even been sent into space. \n \n Of the many photographs you can see on the Scattering CJ Facebook page, one appears more often than any other. It is a picture of a young man, smiling into the camera, sunglasses resting on his head and wearing a Boston Red Sox T-shirt. \n \n He is CJ Twomey from Maine in the United States - a former member of the US air force who loved to travel and loved adventure. On 14 April 2010, when he was 20 years old, CJ took his own life. \n \n Last November, as his mother was looking at the urn filled with her son's ashes sitting on the mantelpiece, she decided that she wanted to send him on a journey. \n \n \"It dawned on me that his ashes would be sitting in that urn forever,\" says Hallie Twomey. \"He didn't get to see the world and I wanted to give CJ something he didn't get a chance to have.\" \n \n After discussing it with her husband John, Hallie set up a Facebook page asking if anyone would be willing to scatter a small amount of CJ's ashes in a place of their choosing. \n \n Image copyright Facebook/Scattering CJ Image caption CJ's ashes have been scattered in Machu Picchu, Peru... \n \n Image copyright Facebook/Scattering CJ Image caption ... and on a tea plantation in Tamil Nadu, India \n \n At the beginning, the offers were slow to come in - Hallie and her family thought they would be lucky to get a few hundred people making contact. \n \n But one year on, more than 9,000 people have offered to take some of her son's ashes on their travels and Hallie now has to be selective. \n \n Find out more Hallie Twomey spoke to Weekend on the BBC World Service \n \n She chooses people going to places that are particularly unique or where CJ's remains haven't yet been. \"I wish we could involve every person that offers but we only have a finite amount of ash,\" says Hallie. \n \n When someone makes contact and the offer is accepted, Hallie places a small amount of CJ's ashes into a little bag and posts it along with a letter and the photo of CJ in his Red Sox shirt. \n \n \"I ask them to let CJ know that we loved him,\" says Hallie. \"And the thing I need people to do most for me is to tell CJ I'm sorry. Because I am - I feel I let my son down.\" \n \n Image copyright Facebook/Scattering CJ Image caption CJ's ashes have been skydiving several times, including on this occasion in Arizona \n \n Image copyright Facebook/Scattering CJ Image caption Scattering the ashes on sand dunes near Swakopmund in Namibia... \n \n Image copyright Facebook/Scattering CJ Image caption ... and from a hot air balloon over Cappadocia, Turkey \n \n Those who scatter CJ's ashes are asked to take a picture and send back a few words about their chosen location. The Scattering CJ Facebook page is filled with photographs from around the world - famous landmarks, snowy mountains and tropical islands all make an appearance. \n \n Most of the photographs include the little bag of ashes and CJ's picture in the foreground - many show a small amount of ash held in someone's outstretched hand, ready to be scattered. \n \n The page also shows an impressive list of destinations where CJ's ashes have been scattered - ranging from Alabama to Afghanistan and Cambodia to Cape Verde. \n \n Image copyright Facebook/Scattering CJ Image caption On the Zugspitze, the highest mountain in Germany... \n \n Image copyright Facebook/Scattering CJ Image caption ... and 16m below the sea surface near the Dominican Republic \n \n Despite so many packets being sent to so many destinations, there have been relatively few issues in getting CJ's ashes to those who wish to scatter them. \n \n But a few envelopes have arrived at their destination damaged - some with the ashes missing. \"That can be hard to hear but we decided to believe that wherever CJ's ashes ended up, that's where they were meant to be,\" says Hallie. \n \n Sending cremated remains by post \n \n Image copyright Reuters \n \n Postal systems around the world have different rules about sending cremated human remains by post \n \n The US Postal Service (USPS) allows the shipment of cremated remains both domestically and internationally \n \n The Royal Mail in the UK considers human remains, including ashes, a \"prohibited item\" and will not transport them \n \n If posting ashes internationally, the USPS advises to check whether the destination country permits it or if certain procedures apply \n \n (Source: USPS / Royal Mail) \n \n Occasionally some of CJ's ashes are returned - perhaps people have changed their minds or their travel plans have fallen through. It's something they are asked to do if they feel they can't fulfil their offer. \n \n But it can be difficult for Hallie to receive those packets in the post. \"I'm not sure why that makes me feel sad when it has always been an option,\" writes Hallie on Facebook. \n \n The people who have offered to scatter CJ's ashes are from different backgrounds, age groups and nationalities. Some of them have had their lives affected by suicide or perhaps contemplated it themselves. \n \n \"Because of CJ and his journey, some people have shared with us that they no longer want to end their life,\" says Hallie. \"We never for even one moment imagined that our son's story could save others.\" \n \n Image copyright Facebook/Scattering CJ Image caption Port Willunga Beach in South Australia \n \n Image copyright Facebook/Scattering CJ Image caption Overlooking Haikou City on Hainan Island in China \n \n Image copyright Facebook/Scattering CJ Image caption One of the US Winter Olympic team offered to scatter CJ at the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi \n \n Although his ashes have been scattered across seven continents including Antarctica, there are still a few locations his family would love CJ to get to - the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro, the Galapagos Islands, the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt and under the ancient Angel Oak Tree in South Carolina. \n \n CJ's journey hasn't only been confined to Earth - his ashes were part of a rocket's payload launched from the New Mexican desert in October. \"It allowed our larger than life son to reach farther than we ever imagined,\" says Hallie. \n \n Image copyright John Ottoway/Scattering CJ \n \n CJ's family don't intend to send all of his ashes away - a small amount will remain at home and some have already been incorporated into jewellery for Hallie to wear. They have never measured the exact amount of ash in CJ's urn but about two thirds of what they planned to share has now been sent. \n \n Their aim is to post the remaining third by early 2015 but there is no definite timeline. \"I trust that I will know when it is time to be finished,\" says Hallie. \n \n Image copyright Hallie Twomey Image caption Hallie Twomey and her son CJ \n \n Hallie doesn't know how she will feel when the Scattering CJ project draws to a close and she sends off the last packet of CJ's ashes - but she is sure she will cry. \"Mailing your child's ashes anywhere will never feel right because it's totally wrong that he's gone,\" she says, but she's glad she did it. \n \n \"As his Mum, my single biggest fear is that CJ will be forgotten,\" says Hallie. And with more than 18,000 people now following the Scattering CJ Facebook page and new offers to scatter his ashes still arriving each day, she hopes that sending CJ on this journey will keep his memory alive. \n \n Hallie Twomey spoke to Weekend on the BBC World Service \n \n Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox. ||||| AUBURN, Maine (AP) \u2014 A Maine mother who's using social media to have her son's ashes scattered all over the world has sent him on his greatest journey yet: to space. \n \n Using her Facebook page, which has more than 17,000 likes, Hallie Twomey has mailed hundreds of packets of her son C.J.'s ashes to strangers worldwide so they can be scattered at the many places he wasn't able to see before he died more than four years ago. \n \n On Thursday, a rocket containing a vial of his ashes was launched into space from the desert in New Mexico. The rocket spent a few minutes in space before landing in the nearby White Sands Missile Range. \n \n Twomey called it the perfect send off for her adrenaline-loving son, who was 20 years old when he shot himself after getting into an argument with his parents. \n \n His ashes have been scattered in nearly all 50 states and in dozens of places overseas, including Saudi Arabia, Thailand and Denmark. \n \n Twomey, who lives with her husband and 21-year-old son in Auburn, Maine, said that while she hasn't been able to get over her guilt, she has been touched by the kindness of strangers over the last year. \n \n \"I have never experienced such a collective sort of hug,\" she said. \"I feel less alone, and for me that has been huge.\" \n \n Twomey's ashes and those of about three dozen others were on the rocket. The roughly $1,000 to launch his ashes was paid by for by Celestis, the company that has completed 13 such memorial spaceflights. ||||| He Killed Himself After An Argument With His Mom. What She Did Next Is Unbelievable. \n \n Hallie Twomey is living a nightmare no mother should ever have to experience. The last things she ever said to her son were spoken during an argument. On April 14, 2010, after fighting with his mother, C.J. Twomey tragically took his own life. The former member of the Air Force was only 20 years-old when he died. His ashes used to sit upon a shelf in his mother\u2019s home, but now, she is sending him on one last adventure with the help ofFacebook. What she is doing for him is simply unbelievable. \n \n Hallie didn\u2019t want her son to just sit upon a shelf for her benefit. She wanted him to be able to travel the world one last time. So, this mother made a request on Facebook. She enlisted the help of others to take him to lands he never even dreamed of. At first just her friends were helping\u2026 but then after the original post was shared over 100 times, strangers began volunteering to help C.J. travel, too. At Lake Pattagansett in East Lyme, Connecticut. There are only two rules for helping scatter C.J.\u2019s ashes. (This photo is at St. Paul\u2019s Chapel in NYC.) 1.) They have to tell him that his mother will always love him. 2.) They have to tell him that she is sorry. (At St. Theresa\u2019s Chapel Beach in Juneau, Alaska.) \u201cYOU MUST AGREE TO SAY THAT,\u201d Hallie posted on Facebook. (Near the Hollywood sign in California.) Given how Hallie and C.J. were before they were separated\u2026 (At the Gulf of Mexico.) She wants him to know, for sure, before he takes off into the world. (From Iron Mountain in California.) At Lake Erie in Cleveland, Ohio. In Jamaica. In Plymouth, Massachusetts. At Milford Lake in Kansas. At Kalapana-Kapoho Road in Hawaii. Inside the Banyan Tree at Rainbow Falls in Hawaii. These are all of the different places that C.J.\u2019s ashes have been scattered across the US, but they aren\u2019t the only places. Over 150 packets of his ashes have been sent around the world. One volunteer said they would even take him to the top of Mount Everest. \n \n This is a message from his mother, posted on the Facebook page dedicated to C.J.\u2019s journey: \n \n SCATTERING CJ is a labor of love. \n \n It\u2019s an idea born out of my broken mom\u2019s heart following the tragic suicide of my beloved son CJ. \n \n CJ was only 20 years old when he ended his life. \n \n For the past three years, I have literally stumbled through life trying to wake from this horrible nightmare. I can\u2019t change what happened although I would do anything to bring him back. \n \n As his mom, I want nothing more than to turn back the clock and fix whatever led him to this decision\u2026repair what was broken\u2026give him the life he no longer has\u2026grant him the gift of time that he\u2019ll never know. \n \n SCATTERING CJ is my attempt to give my son SOMETHING. It\u2019s a mission to show my son \u2013 my crazy, life of the party, lover of people, smile so wide it entered a room before he did son \u2013 some of the world that he never got to see. It\u2019s an effort to allow my child to forever rest in locations hand picked by caring friends, family and strangers alike. \n \n It\u2019s simply a chance to put my faith in mankind (a faith that has completely disappeared since witnessing my son end his life) and ask that others help me complete CJ\u2019s final journey. \n \n Please share this page and my mission with others if you are so inclined. So many people have already agreed to help take CJ on this journey but I truly hope many more will. This page will allow people to quickly and easily indicate that they are willing to scatter his ashes. It will also be a great way for me to share some of the pictures and video that I receive. Please feel free to comment or post as often as you\u2019d like. Each time someone shares this page or leaves a quick note, CJ\u2019s journey will grow. \n \n Thank you in advance to anyone that offers to take CJ on an adventure. \n \n I honestly can\u2019t find words that adequately express how much I appreciate it. \n \n Please know that you are helping my very broken mom heart deal with the worst pain I have ever and will ever face. \n \n Share this story and help Hallie ease her pain\u2026 and maybe even help C.J. travel the world. No family should ever have to experience something like this. \n \n Source: Scattering CJ on Facebook \n \n ADVERTISEMENT \n \n What do you think? ||||| Christopher John Twomey 1989 - 2010 \"Fly High CJ\" More Photos \n \n hristopher John Twomey, known to his loved ones as CJ, passed away unexpectedly on Thursday, April 15, 2010 at the age of 20. He was the beloved first born son of John and Hallie Twomey, arriving on July 3, 1989 in Stoneham, Massachusetts. Following his graduation from Edward Little High School in 2007, CJ spent time proudly serving as an enlisted aircrew member in the United States Air Force, successfully earning his enlisted aircrew wings. CJ was known as a friend to all, a natural comedian and the life of the party. His smile brought joy to his friends and his family alike. He was charismatic, extremely charming and always willing to lend a hand to a friend in need. CJ never met a mirror he didn\u2019t like \u2013 he was handsome and he knew it! He loved unconditionally and made sure those people he cared about always felt special. His zest for life and his ability to see the good in all will never be forgotten. He was and always will be the world's greatest big brother to Connor. Their relationship was something to behold. They adored one another from day one and were the best of friends. CJ loved adventure and considered himself a bit of an adrenaline junky. He loved jumping out of planes as part of his military training as well as riding roller coasters, and he appreciated fast cars. He was the first to suggest an activity and liked to be the center of attention. He was a people person from the day he was born and felt comfortable in groups of all sizes. He loved loud music and was often found dancing his way through the house. He loved to give giant bear hugs and found great pleasure in poking his family until they begged him to stop. He loved military themed movies, goofy TV shows and could quote line after line from Monty Python. CJ often talked about his love of travel and dreamed of visiting distant lanes. He adored family vacations and was a beach bum at heart. He loved flying and was game to jump on a plane and head out to locations unknown at the drop of a hat. CJ\u2019s death at such a young age prevented him from exploring the world around him. Believing that he would rather become part of the lands he never got to see rather than spend eternity in an urn on the shelf, CJ\u2019s mother started the Scattering CJ journey. SCATTERING CJ is a mission to show her crazy, life-of-the-party, lover-of-people, smile-so-wide-it-entered-a-room-before-he-did son some of the world that he never got to see. It\u2019s an effort to allow her child to forever rest in locations hand picked by caring friends, family and strangers alike. It is the last final gift a heartbroken mom can give her beloved son. No matter where CJ\u2019s ashes land on this vast planet, sending him into space will forever remain as SCATTERING CJ\u2019s greatest accomplishment. Charles Chafer and the Celestis family have given CJ\u2019s family a gift they can never repay. Fly high CJ. You are missed and will never be forgotten. You are truly worth remembering. ~",

The studio is working with federal investigators. \n \n Iger's comments came during a town hall meeting with ABC employees in New York City, according to multiple sources. \n \n Disney's upcoming theatrical release slate include Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, which opens Friday, and Cars 3, set to bow June 16. Rumors circulated online last week that a work print of Star Wars: The Last Jedi had been pirated and was being held for ransom, but days later online chatter tipped that rumor as a hoax. The studio had no comment. \n \n The Disney chief said the hackers demanded that a huge sum be paid in Bitcoin. They said they would release five minutes of the film at first, and then in 20-minute chunks until their financial demands are met. \n \n While movie piracy has long been a scourge, ransoms appear to be a new twist. \n \n The ransom demand of Disney comes only weeks after a hacker uploaded 10 episodes of the upcoming season of Orange Is the New Black to The Pirate Bay after Netflix refused to pay an undisclosed amount. The episodes were posted on Pirate Bay six weeks ahead of the series' official June 9 launch. \n \n Several Hollywood agencies have also been targeted by hackers with extortion plots in recent months, including UTA, ICM and WME.",

Disney CEO Bob Iger told employees Monday that hackers have seized a Disney movie and are demanding a massive Bitcoin payment, the Guardian reports. Iger, widely believed to have been talking about franchise reboot Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, said the unidentified hackers threatened to release five minutes of the movie online followed by 20-minute chunks until the ransom was paid or the entire movie was leaked. The movie is scheduled for a May 25 release. Disney has refused to pay the ransom and is working with the FBI, according to the Hollywood Reporter. The latest Orange Is the New Black season was recently released by hackers after Netflix failed to pay a ransom, and analysts say studios can probably expect many more such threats in the year to come. The likes of Disney and Netflix may have efficient security, but you \"have all these vendors and small production companies which don\u2019t have great security and probably don\u2019t have the budget to focus on their own security so hackers get in pretty easily,\" Hector Monsegur, a former hacker who became an FBI informant and director of Security Assessments for Rhino Security Lab, tells Deadline.",

The Dutch carrier said it had sent the results of its tests to the Dutch Transport Ministry and is ... ||||| \n \n EU transport ministers are to hold emergency talks by video conference on easing the air travel crisis caused by a volcanic ash cloud in Europe's skies. More than 6.8 million passengers have been affected so far, as the crisis enters its fifth day. Airports and airlines are questioning the need for curbs said to be costing airlines $200m (\u00a3130m) a day. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has criticised European governments' response. \"We must move away from this blanket closure and find ways to flexibly open air space, step by step,\" IATA head Giovanni Bisignani told a news briefing in Paris. MAJOR EU AIRPORTS 0800 19/04 Heathrow - closed Frankfurt - closed after reopening on a limited basis for several hours on Sunday Paris Charles de Gaulle - closed Schipol, Amsterdam - closed Rome - limited service Madrid - limited service The enormous shroud of fine mineral dust particles now stretches from the Arctic Circle in the north to the French Mediterranean coast in the south, and from Spain into Russia. Airspace remains closed, or partially closed, in more than 20 countries. Sixty-three thousand flights have been cancelled in the four days since the clampdown began. And the prospect of a return to normal air travel remains far from clear. Speaking ahead of the EU talks, Transport Commissioner Siim Kallas said: \"We cannot just wait until this ash cloud dissipates.\" The Spanish Minister for Europe, Diego Lopez Garrido, had said on Sunday that up to half of the flights across Europe could operate on Monday. He was speaking after talks with Eurocontrol, which co-ordinates air traffic control in 38 nations. It had recommended the current flight ban. But Brian Flynn, deputy head of operations for Eurocontrol, told the BBC that while half of the European landmass could be clear of ash cloud, that did not mean half of the flights could go ahead. The flight bans came amid fears that the ash - a mixture of glass, sand and rock particles - can seriously damage aircraft engines. The international airports council, ACI, said a total of 313 airports had been paralysed by the restrictions and the global backlog was affecting more than 6.8 million travellers. In another development, hundreds of thousands of Kenyans working in agriculture, the country's largest export sector, face economic uncertainty because of the flight bans. Refrigerated stores at Nairobi airport and on farms are now completely full, and a huge amount of fresh flowers and vegetables destined for the European market is in danger of perishing, the BBC's East Africa correspondent, Will Ross, reports. The problems have also led to the postponement of next Saturday's Japanese MotoGP. Data assessment The EU transport ministers' video conference, hosted by Spain, is set to consider a proposal that passengers from countries like Britain, who are stranded in the US or Asia, would fly into Spain and then continue their journey by train, boat or coach. ANALYSIS Robert Peston, BBC Business Editor The two biggest British airlines are incurring painful losses. British Airways is losing around \u00a325m ($38m) a day; and Easyjet up to \u00a35m ($7.6m) a day. But they also have substantial borrowing facilities and cash, and can cope with a financial pain so long as it doesn't last too long. Many other airlines across Europe are less fortunate, which is why ministers are telling me that a Europe-wide financial support scheme for the airline industry - funded by taxpayers - is a very live issue. As for the impact on the wider economy, supermarkets say that supplies of imported flowers and exotic fruit and vegetables are beginning to run low. And businesses dependant on air freight are hurting. But the crisis would probably have to endure for many more days yet for the cost to be big enough to upset Europe's economic recovery. Peston: Airlines to ask for help Dutch Transport Minister Camiel Eurlings was \"advocating for a different approach to the problem\", the Dutch transport inspectorate said. This would entail \"drawing a distinction between areas with low concentrations and those with high concentrations\" of ash when making decisions on air safety. The UK Transport Secretary, Lord Adonis, said information from various test flights on Sunday, assessing the impact of the dust on jet engines, would be considered during the conference. Siim Kallas said European authorities were working to find a solution that did not compromise safety. Southern Iceland's Eyjafjallajoekull volcano began erupting for the second time in a month on Wednesday. Iceland's Meteorological Office said tremors from the volcano had grown more intense but the column of ash rising from it had eased to around 5km (3.1 miles). Ash still 'very worrying' Britain has extended a ban on most flights in its airspace until at least 1900 local time on Monday (1800 GMT). Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Ireland, Germany and the Netherlands are keeping their airspace closed until 1200 GMT on Monday. Spain has re-opened its airspace after a brief closure. Officials there have suggested its airports could be used as an entry platform into Europe. Our business editor, Robert Peston, understands that British Airways fears it may not be allowed to fly normal services until Thursday at the earliest. One measure being discussed by the British government is the possibility of deploying the Royal Navy to collect some of the estimated 150,000 Britons who are stranded abroad. While several airlines carried out test flights and reported planes showing no obvious damage after flying through the ash, a scientific test flight over Britain concluded that the situation could still be dangerous. \n \n I've been stranded in Madrid since Thursday. We've been told we cannot get a flight until 26 April at the earliest. \n \n Christine Blanchard \n \n Volcano ash: Your stories Dr Guy Gratton, who was part of the scientific team, said: \"It's still quite a complex mixture of clear air and very worrying but invisible volcanic ash at all sorts of heights.\" Weather experts say wind patterns mean the cloud is not likely to move far until later in the week. Eurocontrol said there were only 5,000 flights in European airspace on Sunday, against 24,000 normally. \n \n \n \n Bookmark with: Delicious \n \n Digg \n \n reddit \n \n Facebook \n \n StumbleUpon What are these?

Increasingly angry airline officials are demanding flight bans be lifted, accusing governments of crisis mismanagement.

Saipov was wounded, and, as of Wednesday morning, was out of surgery and in custody at an unidentified hospital, according to CNN. \n \n The NYPD patrol guide, which is posted on the department website, instructs officers to \u201capply no more than the reasonable force necessary to gain control,\u201d and to use de-escalation techniques to avoid excessive force. Officers are trained to use minimal force to stop even potentially deadly assailants, but cops must make split-second decisions that require them to determine who is a deadly threat and who is not. Saipov\u2019s weapons clearly suggested an imminent threat. \n \n Many officers in similar situations have followed the patrol guide and shot, only to find themselves later charged with using excessive force. In the moment, the officer likely is not thinking about the ramifications of using deadly force, but scrutiny after the fact often centers on why and how the cop fired. \n \n The NYPD did not comment for this story, but the head of a national police organization said it is premature to question Nash\u2019s response to the attack, adding he followed his training to focus on \u201cneutralizing the threat.\u201d \n \n \u201c[Police officers] don\u2019t go into it with the idea of thinking about killing somebody,\u201d said Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major City Chiefs Association, which represents sheriffs and chiefs of police in the nation\u2019s largest metropolitan areas (including New York). \u201cThey\u2019re thinking about neutralizing the threat.\u201d \n \n Stephens added that most police officers are trained to shoot \u201ccenter mass\u201d to stop a threat\u2014meaning the chest area\u2014because it increases the likelihood the shot will hit the suspect and stop them.

CNN reports that ISIS didn't use Saipov's name in its claim and offers no evidence to back that claim up, including any showing that ISIS helped plan the attack or even knew about it beforehand. The site notes the wording is similar what it used after the Pulse Orlando shooting and a 2016 attack in Nice, France. CNN adds this is the first time ISIS has posted such a claim first in its newspaper rather than via its Amaq News Agency. Per ABC News, the ISIS statement also mentioned that the attack took place \"close to the monument for the 9/11 raid\" and, oddly, claimed that \"60 crusaders\" were killed or injured in the Halloween attack; the official count so far is eight dead, around a dozen wounded.",

    "document": "President Donald Trump, accompanied by his daughter Ivanka, waves as they walk to board Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Wednesday, Feb. 1, 2017. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (Associated Press) \n \n DOVER AIR FORCE BASE, Del. (AP) \u2014 Assuming the somber duties of commander in chief, President Donald Trump made an unannounced trip Wednesday to honor the returning remains of a U.S. Navy SEAL killed in a weekend raid in Yemen. \n \n Chief Special Warfare Operator William \"Ryan\" Owens, a 36-year-old from Peoria, Illinois, was the first known U.S. combat casualty since Trump took office less than two weeks ago. More than half a dozen militant suspects were also killed in the raid on an al-Qaida compound and three other U.S. service members were wounded. \n \n More than a dozen civilians were also killed in the operation, including the 8-year-old daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical cleric and U.S. citizen who was targeted and killed by a drone strike in 2011. \n \n Trump's trip to Delaware's Dover Air Base was shrouded in secrecy. The president and his daughter, Ivanka, departed the White House in the presidential helicopter with their destination unannounced. A small group of journalists traveled with Trump on the condition that the visit was not reported until his arrival. \n \n After returning to the White House, Trump commented on the trip at the swearing-in of Rex Tillerson as secretary of state. \n \n \"I just returned from an amazing visit with a great, great family at Dover,\" Trump said. \"It is something very sad, very beautiful. Ryan, a great man.\" \n \n Marine One landed at Dover shortly before a C-17 believed to be carrying Owens' remains touched down. The president met with Owens' family during a two-hour visit to the base. The sailor's family had requested that Trump's visit and the return of Owens' remains be private. \n \n Former President Barack Obama lifted a ban on media coverage of the casualty returns, though families may still request privacy. A spokeswoman at Dover said about half of families choose to allow media coverage. \n \n Owens joined the Navy in 1998 and was the recipient of two Bronze stars, a Joint Service Commendation and an Afghanistan Campaign Medal, among other honors. In a statement following his death, the Navy Special Command called Owens a \"devoted father, a true professional and a wonderful husband.\" \n \n His death underscores the human costs of the military campaigns Trump now oversees. Far fewer troops are serving in combat now than in the wars Trump's predecessors led in Afghanistan and Iraq, but thousands of Americans remain in hotspots around the world. \n \n In Afghanistan, where America's longest war continues, about 8,400 U.S. troops are training and advising local forces. More than U.S. 5,100 troops in Iraq and about 500 in Syria are involved in the campaign against the Islamic State group. The U.S. also engages in counterterrorism operations \u2014 mainly drone strikes \u2014 in Yemen, where Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula has exploited the chaos of the country's civil war. \n \n Sunday's pre-dawn raid \u2014 which a defense official said was planned by the Obama administration but authorized by Trump \u2014 could signal a new escalation against extremist groups in Yemen. \n \n As a candidate, Trump said he would be willing to \"take out\" the families of terrorists in order to root out extremism. On Tuesday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said no Americans \"will ever be targeted\" in raids against terror suspects. \n \n The president's trip to Dover comes as he begins weighing whether to reshape U.S. military activities around the world. As a candidate, he vowed to be tougher on the Islamic State and at one point said he would be willing to send up to 30,000 U.S. troops to fight the extremist group in Iraq and Syria. Last week, Trump gave the Pentagon and other agencies 30 days to submit a plan for defeating the Islamic State. \n \n Trump has said little about his approach to Afghanistan. Obama had pledged to end the war there on his watch, but continuing security concerns prompted him to extend the U.S. military campaign, handing the war off to a third American president. \n \n Trump, who never served in the armed forces and received student and medical deferments during the Vietnam War, had an uneven relationship with the military community during the presidential campaign. \n \n About 60 percent of voters who served in the military supported Trump in the presidential election, compared with 34 percent who voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton, according to exit polls. But Trump was also criticized by military groups, including the Veterans of Foreign Wars, for his feud with the Khan family, whose Muslim-American son was killed while serving in Iraq. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writer Lolita C.

With no imminent plans to move to Washington, she's said to want the couple's 10-year-old son Barron to stay at his school at least until the end of the academic year. \n \n On Tuesday, she was conspicuously absent when Trump announced his Supreme Court pick. Vice President Mike Pence and Neil Gorsuch brought their wives. Even Trump's sons Donald Jr. and Eric made the journey from New York. \n \n On Wednesday, the president's daughter Ivanka accompanied him to Delaware to honor a fallen Navy SEAL. Unlike her stepmother, Ivanka has already moved from New York with her husband, White House advisor Jared Kushner. \n \n Asked in December if he would be lonely rattling around the White House on his own, then president-elect Donald Trump told Fox News: \"No, I'll be working.\" \n \n Never in modern times -- when Americans are accustomed to having visible and active first ladies -- has a president's wife not moved straight to Washington. \n \n \"Certainly in that time we haven't seen a phenomenon such as this where the first lady delays for at least several months moving into the White House,\" said Katherine Jellison, history professor at Ohio University. \n \n For more news videos visit Yahoo View, available now on iOS and Android. \n \n - Quiet start common - \n \n Melania's absence has prompted speculation in the media, which Trump's senior advisor Stephen Bannon has likened to \"the opposition\" for its tough, critical coverage of the president's campaign and his first two weeks in office. \n \n \"Whither Melania Trump?\" 12 days without a public sighting,\" CNN said. \"Where is Melania?\" asked The Washington Post. \"Separate Lives,\" ran a headline in celebrity magazine US Weekly. \n \n The White House announced Wednesday that the first lady had appointed a chief of staff -- Lindsay Reynolds, who previously served there under George W. Bush. \n \n \"I am putting together a professional and highly experienced team which will take time to do properly,\" the first lady said in the statement. \n \n Still, first ladies tend to maintain low profiles at the start. Hillary Clinton and Rosalynn Carter proved exceptions to the rule. \n \n \"The first lady often sets out her policy agenda in March or April, complementing and reinforcing the 100-days agenda of the president,\" said Connecticut College government professor MaryAnn Borrelli. \n \n But beyond admiring Michelle Obama and Jacqueline Kennedy and mentioning a potential campaign against cyber bullying, Melania has given little indication so far of what kind of first lady she wants to be. \n \n - Reframing the job? - \n \n Since Trump assumed office, her official Facebook and Twitter accounts have issued just one update -- on January 21 -- proclaiming her \"deeply honored\" to serve. \n \n Just one appointment to her staff has been revealed besides Reynolds: longtime friend and New York event planner Stephanie Winston Wolkoff as senior adviser. Other positions such as press and social secretaries have yet to be filled. \n \n The absence is not helping her lackluster approval ratings, partly a by-product of her husband's deep unpopularity among half the electorate. She was also mocked during the campaign for a major speech that plagiarized Michelle Obama. \n \n But Borelli believes her unpopularity is not entirely unusual. \n \n \"I think that first ladies often enter the White House with a mix of support and suspicion and then the job is -- because they do public outreach -- how to capitalize on the support and manage suspicion,\" she said. \n \n Michelle Obama, the first African-American first lady, and Clinton and Eleanor Roosevelt, who both defied the meek housewife stereotype, also came in for heavy criticism particularly at the start. \n \n Others say it is time for an independent first lady who reflects reality in the 21st century, when few American women are defined by their husbands. \n \n Should Melania continue to keep a low profile, future generations may credit her as a modernizer who broke free from the confines of her position. \n \n \"It may lower expectations for the next woman,\" Jellison said. \"She won't feel that she has to be the perfect American wife and mother role model.\" ||||| An aide to Melania Trump on Wednesday confirmed that the First Lady will move to the White House starting at the beginning of the summer. \n \n Interested in Melania Trump?

Add Interest \n \n \"Mrs. Trump will be moving to D.C. and settling into the White House at the end of the school year, splitting her time between New York and D.C. in the meantime,\" Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, senior adviser to the First Lady told ABC News. \"Mrs. Trump is honored to serve this country and is taking the role and responsibilities of the First Lady very seriously.\" \n \n The confirmation comes after a rumor sparked by tabloids early Wednesday morning that the First Lady and her 10-year-old son Barron Trump were not considering a move to Washington, D.C. from New York City. \n \n Later on Wednesday, the White House also announced that Lindsay Reynolds would be joining the First Lady\u2019s team as her Chief of Staff. \n \n \"I am putting together a professional and highly-experienced team which will take time to do properly,\u201d the First Lady said in a White House press release. \n \n Apart from being the First Lady\u2019s Chief of Staff, Reynolds is also an assistant to the President. But in her capacity as Chief of Staff, Reynolds will be in charge of \"managing the agenda and day to day operations\" of the First Lady\u2019s office. \n \n \"It has been an honor to take on the responsibility of the position of First Lady, with its long history as an important representative of the President, our family, and the traditions of our nation around the world,\" the First Lady said in the statement. ||||| Melania Trump has hired a chief of staff, a move that puts her first official mark on the White House, but the first lady\u2019s office is likely to be pretty lonely for the foreseeable future. \n \n Trump herself hasn\u2019t been in Washington since her husband\u2019s inauguration weekend, and it\u2019s not clear when she will return. She has said she plans to continue living in Trump Tower in Manhattan while son Barron finishes out the school year. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n And even though Lindsay Reynolds, a private fundraising planner and former official in President George W. Bush\u2019s visitors office, will be joining the second floor of the East Wing, there\u2019s little insight on when she\u2019ll get co-workers. \n \n Key roles still open in the first lady\u2019s office include the press operation, scheduling, correspondence and the social office. \n \n The relatively empty first lady\u2019s office is a break from Melania Trump\u2019s predecessors. Laura Bush and Michelle Obama each assumed the role with a chief of staff and a social secretary at the ready. \n \n But some say it\u2019s not surprising that Melania Trump hasn\u2019t staked her claim on the office of the first lady, since she has yet to settle into the White House. The first lady\u2019s role comes with a budget and a staff that technically reports to the office of the president, but there\u2019s no statutory authority and its contours have been shaped by tradition. \n \n \u201cWe have become accustomed with the activism of the first lady, but there\u2019s nothing that is required and there really is no specific job description for the first lady,\u201d said Anita McBride, former chief of staff to Laura Bush and an executive in residence at American University. \u201cEach occupant gets to rewrite how they want to handle it.\u201d \n \n Reynolds was involved in planning the inauguration under former Vogue events planner Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, who is acting as a consultant to the first lady. Key roles still open in the first lady\u2019s office include the press operation, scheduling, correspondence and the social secretary\u2019s office, which plans state dinners and other formal events. \n \n Residence staff had to step in and organize the swearing-in ceremony for White House appointees and the lunch with British Prime Minister Theresa May last week. \u201cThe most important person in the first lady\u2019s office is the social secretary,\u201d said McBride. She cautioned that working without a social secretary is not a \u201clong-term solution.\u201d \n \n \u201cClearly you\u2019re going to have a lot of social events that will require the expertise of a social secretary,\u201d she said. \n \n Ebs Burnough, former deputy social secretary to Michelle Obama, said it\u2019s not necessary to have an active first lady\u2019s office as long as the social secretary has access to the Oval Office. \u201cThe social secretary can conceivably not see the first lady and just deal directly with the president,\u201d he said. \n \n Transition officials sought guidance from staffers who worked for Obama and for Laura Bush, according to sources, which is customary. Since the transition, Jessica Boulanger, a Washington-based communications executive and the founder of a line of maternity wear, has been helping the first lady field press requests pro bono, she said. \n \n Obama\u2019s East Wing was largely staffed by Inauguration Day, and even staff attracted an unusual degree of attention \u2014 including social secretary Desiree Rogers, who scored a spread in Vogue. Obama used her role to promote exercise and healthy eating, a campaign that required a staff to manage and execute. \n \n Melania Trump said during the campaign that she would fight online bullying. \n \n Melania Trump\u2019s stepdaughter Ivanka joined her father on his trip to Dover Air Force Base, where they were present as the remains of a Navy SEAL killed in a weekend raid in Yemen were returned to the U.S. It was the first time Ivanka Trump, who\u2019s moved with her family to Washington and whose husband, Jared Kushner, is a senior White House adviser, had taken on any of the symbolic duties usually reserved for a president\u2019s spouse. \n \n Ivanka Trump was a vocal presence on the campaign trail and was in the West Wing last weekend as her father made calls. A source close to her says she doesn\u2019t have a desk in the East Wing \u201cfor now.\u201d \n \n White House aides have said Melania Trump will move to Washington in the summer, once Barron, the president\u2019s youngest child, finishes the school year in New York. \n \n People in Melania Trump\u2019s Upper East Side set haven\u2019t been surprised to see her take a low-key approach to her new role. \u201cShe's sort of like Rapunzel in the tower,\u201d said one New York City socialite who knows Trump from her infrequent appearances on the New York social and charity scene. \n \n Annie Karni contributed to this report. \n \n",

These had already begun to diversify into not just the vertebrates, the group to which we and our ancestors belong and animals such as starfish and sea urchins. \n \n Because they looked so different from one another, it was difficult for the scientists to determine what an earlier, common ancestor might have looked like. \n \n The study suggests that its body was symmetrical, which is a characteristic inherited by many of its evolutionary descendants, including humans. \n \n Saccorhytus was also covered with a thin, relatively flexible skin and muscles, leading the researchers to conclude that it moved by contracting its muscles and got around by wriggling. \n \n The researchers say that its most striking feature is its large mouth, relative to the rest of its body. They say that it probably ate by engulfing food particles, or even other creatures. \n \n Also interesting are the conical structures on its body. These, the scientists suggest, might have allowed the water that it swallowed to escape and so might have been a very early version of gills. \n \n Follow Pallab on Twitter ||||| Researchers have identified traces of what they believe is the earliest known prehistoric ancestor of humans \u2013 a microscopic, bag-like sea creature, which lived about 540 million years ago. \n \n Named Saccorhytus, after the sack-like features created by its elliptical body and large mouth, the species is new to science and was identified from microfossils found in China. It is thought to be the most primitive example of a so-called \u201cdeuterostome\u201d \u2013 a broad biological category that encompasses a number of sub-groups, including the vertebrates. \n \n If the conclusions of the study, published in the journal Nature, are correct, then Saccorhytus was the common ancestor of a huge range of species, and the earliest step yet discovered on the evolutionary path that eventually led to humans, hundreds of millions of years later. \n \n Modern humans are, however, unlikely to perceive much by way of a family resemblance. Saccorhytus was about a millimetre in size, and probably lived between grains of sand on the seabed. Its features were spectacularly preserved in the fossil record \u2013 and intriguingly, the researchers were unable to find any evidence that the animal had an anus. \n \n The study was carried out by an international team of academics, including researchers from the University of Cambridge in the UK and Northwest University in Xi\u2019an China, with support from other colleagues at institutions in China and Germany. \n \n Simon Conway Morris, Professor of Evolutionary Palaeobiology and a Fellow of St John\u2019s College, University of Cambridge, said: \u201cWe think that as an early deuterostome this may represent the primitive beginnings of a very diverse range of species, including ourselves. To the naked eye, the fossils we studied look like tiny black grains, but under the microscope the level of detail is jaw-dropping. All deuterostomes had a common ancestor, and we think that is what we are looking at here.\u201d \n \n Degan Shu, from Northwest University, added: \u201cOur team has notched up some important discoveries in the past, including the earliest fish and a remarkable variety of other early deuterostomes. Saccorhytus now gives us remarkable insights into the very first stages of the evolution of a group that led to the fish, and ultimately, to us.\u201d \n \n Most other early deuterostome groups are from about 510 to 520 million years ago, when they had already begun to diversify into not just the vertebrates, but the sea squirts, echinoderms (animals such as starfish and sea urchins) and hemichordates (a group including things like acorn worms). This level of diversity has made it extremely difficult to work out what an earlier, common ancestor might have looked like. \n \n The Saccorhytus microfossils were found in Shaanxi Province, in central China, and pre-date all other known deuterostomes. By isolating the fossils from the surrounding rock, and then studying them both under an electron microscope and using a CT scan, the team were able to build up a picture of how Saccorhytus might have looked and lived. This revealed features and characteristics consistent with current assumptions about primitive deuterostomes. \n \n Dr Jian Han, of Northwest University, said: \u201cWe had to process enormous volumes of limestone \u2013 about three tonnes \u2013 to get to the fossils, but a steady stream of new finds allowed us to tackle some key questions: was this a very early echinoderm, or something even more primitive? The latter now seems to be the correct answer.\u201d \n \n In the early Cambrian period, the region would have been a shallow sea. Saccorhytus was so small that it probably lived in between individual grains of sediment on the sea bed. \n \n The study suggests that its body was bilaterally symmetrical \u2013 a characteristic inherited by many of its descendants, including humans \u2013 and was covered with a thin, relatively flexible skin. This in turn suggests that it had some sort of musculature, leading the researchers to conclude that it could have made contractile movements, and got around by wriggling. \n \n Perhaps its most striking feature, however, was its rather primitive means of eating food and then dispensing with the resulting waste. Saccorhytus had a large mouth, relative to the rest of its body, and probably ate by engulfing food particles, or even other creatures. \n \n A crucial observation are small conical structures on its body. These may have allowed the water that it swallowed to escape and so were perhaps the evolutionary precursor of the gills we now see in fish. But the researchers were unable to find any evidence that the creature had an anus. \u201cIf that was the case, then any waste material would simply have been taken out back through the mouth, which from our perspective sounds rather unappealing,\u201d Conway Morris said. \n \n The findings also provide evidence in support of a theory explaining the long-standing mismatch between fossil evidence of prehistoric life, and the record provided by biomolecular data, known as the \u201cmolecular clock\u201d. \n \n Technically, it is possible to estimate roughly when species diverged by looking at differences in their genetic information. In principle, the longer two groups have evolved separately, the greater the biomolecular difference between them should be, and there are reasons to think this process is more or less clock-like. \n \n Unfortunately, before a point corresponding roughly to the time at which Saccorhytus was wriggling in the mud, there are scarcely any fossils available to match the molecular clock\u2019s predictions. Some researchers have theorised that this is because before a certain point, many of the creatures they are searching for were simply too small to leave much of a fossil record. The microscopic scale of Saccorhytus, combined with the fact that it is probably the most primitive deuterostome yet discovered, appears to back this up. \n \n The findings are published in Nature.

The creature is so novel, it has its own family (Saccorhytidae), as well as its own genus and species (Saccorhytus coronaries), named for its wrinkled, sac-like body. (\"Saccus\" means \"sac\" in Latin, and \"rhytis\" means \"wrinkle\" in Greek.) \n \n S. coronaries, with its oval body and large mouth, is likely a deuterostome, a group that includes all vertebrates, including humans, and some invertebrates, such as starfish. [7 Theories on the Origin of Life] \n \n \"We think that as an early deuterostome, this may represent the primitive beginnings of a very diverse range of species, including ourselves,\" Simon Conway Morris, a professor of evolutionary palaeobiology at the University of Cambridge, said in a statement. \"To the naked eye, the fossils we studied look like tiny black grains, but under the microscope the level of detail is jaw-dropping.\" \n \n At first glance, however, S. coronaries does not appear to have much in common with modern humans. It was about a millimeter (0.04 inches) long, and likely lived between grains of sand on the seafloor during the early Cambrian period. \n \n While the mouth onS. coronaries was large for its teensy body, the creature doesn't appear to have an anus. [See Images of the Bag-Like Animal & Other Cambrian Creatures] \n \n \"If that was the case, then any waste material would simply have been taken out back through the mouth, which from our perspective sounds rather unappealing,\" Conway Morris said. \n \n Other deuterostome groups are known from about 510 million to 520 million years ago, a time when they had already started to evolve into vertebrates, as well as sea squirts, echinoderms (starfish and sea urchins) and hemichordates (a group that includes acorn worms). \n \n However, these incredibly diverse animals made it hard for scientists to figure out what the common deuterostome ancestor would have looked like, the researchers said. \n \n The newfound microfossils answered that question, they said. The researchers used an electron microscope and a computed tomography (CT) scan to construct an image of S. coronaries. \n \n \"We had to process enormous volumes of limestone \u2014 about 3 tonnes [3 tons] \u2014 to get to the fossils, but a steady stream of new finds allowed us to tackle some key questions: Was this a very early echinoderm or something even more primitive?\" study co-researcher Jian Han, a paleontologist at Northwest University in China, said in the statement. \"The latter now seems to be the correct answer.\" \n \n The analysis indicated that S. coronaries had a bilaterally symmetrical body, a characteristic it passed down to its descendants, including humans. It was also covered with a thin, flexible skin, suggesting it had muscles of some kind that could perhaps help it wriggle around in the water and engulf food with its large mouth, the researchers said. \n \n Small, conical structures encircling its mouth may have allowed water it swallowed to escape from its body. Perhaps these structures were the precursor of gill slits, the researchers said. \n \n An artist's interpretation of Saccorhytus coronaries, which measured about a millimeter in size. Credit: S Conway Morris/Jian Han \n \n Now that researchers know that deuterostomes existed 540 million years ago, they can try to match the timing to estimates from biomolecular data, known as the \"molecular clock.\" \n \n Theoretically, researchers can determine when two species diverged by quantifying the genetic differences between them. If two groups are distantly related, for instance, they should have extremely different genomes, the researchers said. \n \n However, there are few fossils from S. coronaries' time, making it difficult to match the molecular clocks of other animals to this one, the researchers said. This may be because animals before deuterostomes were simply too miniscule to leave fossils behind, they said. \n \n The findings were published online today (Jan. 30) in the journal Nature. \n \n In another paper, researchers reported on the discovery of another type of tiny animal fossil from the late Cambrian. These creatures, called loriciferans, measured about 0.01 inches (0.3 mm) and, like S. coronaries, lived between grains of sand, the researchers said in a study published online today in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution. \n \n The newly identified species, Eolorica deadwoodensis, discovered in western Canada, shows when multicellular animals began living in areas once inhabited by single-celled organisms, the researchers said. \n \n Original article on Live Science.",

Two French police officials have told The Associated Press that Salah Abdeslam,... (Associated Press) \n \n BRUSSELS (AP) \u2014 The main fugitive from Islamic extremist attacks in Paris in November, Salah Abdeslam, has been arrested in Belgium's capital after four months at large, French police officials said Friday. \n \n The officials told The Associated Press that he was arrested Friday in a major police operation in the Brussels neighborhood of Molenbeek. \n \n Both officials are in contact with people involved in the operation and spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about an ongoing operation. \n \n Abdeslam, 26, was among the attackers who killed 130 people at a rock concert, the national stadium and cafes on Nov. 13 in Paris. \n \n In addition to Abdeslam, the whereabouts of two Paris attack suspects remains unknown, including fellow Molenbeek resident Mohamed Abrini and a man known under the alias of Soufiane Kayal. \n \n Friday's caputure of Abdeslam comes after Belgian authorities say they found his fingerprints in an apartment raided earlier this week in another Brussels neighborhood. \n \n In that raid, a man believed to have been an accomplice of Abdeslam \u2014 Mohamed Belkaid \u2014 was shot dead, Belgian prosecutors say. But two men escaped from the apartment, one of whom appears to have been Abdeslam. \n \n Federal prosecutor Eric Van der Sypt said it was possible Abdeslam had spent \"days, weeks or months,\" in the apartment. \n \n Abdeslam fled Paris after the Nov. 13 attacks. Most of the Paris attackers died that night, including Abdeslam's brother Brahim, who blew himself up. Brahim Abdeslam was buried in the area Thursday. \n \n Brussels-born Salah Abdeslam, a childhood friend of suspected ringleader Abdelhamid Abaaoud, is believed to have driven a group of gunmen who took part. \n \n The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attacks, in which Belgian nationals played key roles. \n \n On Tuesday, a joint team of Belgian and French police showed up to search a residence in the Forest area of Brussels in connection with the Paris investigation, and were unexpectedly fired upon by at least two people inside. Four officers were slightly wounded. \n \n An occupant of the residence was shot dead by a police sniper as he prepared to open fire on police from a window. Police identified him as Belkaid, 35, an Algerian national living illegally in Belgium. \n \n A Kalashnikov assault rifle was found by his body, as well as a book on Salafism, an ultraconservative strain of Islam. Elsewhere in the apartment, police found an Islamic State banner as well as 11 Kalashnikov loaders and a large quantity of ammunition, the prosecutor said. \n \n Belgian authorities initially said Belkaid had no known background in radical Islamic activities. But Friday afternoon, prosecutors issued a statement saying he was \"most probably\" an accomplice of Abdeslam who had been using a fake Belgian ID card in the name of Samir Bouzid. \n \n A man using that ID card was one of the two men seen with Abdeslam in a rental car on the Hungarian-Austrian border in September. \n \n Four days after the Nov. 13 Paris attacks, the same false ID card was used to transfer 750 euros ($847) to Hasna Ait Boulahcen, Abaaoud's niece. Both Ait Boulahcen and Abaaoud died afterward in a police siege. \n \n Abdeslam slipped through a police dragnet to return to Brussels after the bloodbath in Paris, and though the target of an international manhunt, has not been found since. \n \n In January, Belgian authorities said one of his fingerprints was found alongside homemade suicide bomb belts at an apartment in another area of Brussels. Belgian prosecutors said it wasn't known whether he had been at the address in the Schaerbeek district before or after the Paris attacks, or how long he had spent there. \n \n ___ \n \n Raf Casert in Brussels and Raphael Satter and Angela Charlton in Paris contributed to this report. ||||| The most wanted fugitive from November's Paris attacks has been \"caught alive\" after being wounded in a Brussels shootout, say police. \n \n The Belgian asylum minister Theo Francken declared, \"We got him\", referring to 26-year-old Salah Abdeslam, Europe's most wanted man. \n \n Abdeslam suffered leg injuries before being arrested, during a major police operation in the Molenbeek suburb. \n \n Television footage showed armed security forces dragging a man wearing a hooded top out of a building and to a car. \n \n At least 10 shots were heard, grenades launched and police helicopters hovered overhead, while fire engines waited in the street. \n \n A suspect is dragged into a car after a raid in Molenbeek \n \n Footage showed masked, black-clad security forces training their weapons towards upper windows of an apartment block. \n \n White smoke could be seen rising above the building, as police with snarling dogs drove crowds in the streets back away from the scene. \n \n Play video \"Suspect Held Outside Brussels Flat\" Video: Suspect Held Outside Brussels Flat \n \n Events As They Unfold: Live Blog \n \n About three hours after Abdeslam's arrest, two blasts were heard, before a further suspect - who was still holed up - was detained. \n \n In all, Abdeslam was one of five people arrested in the series of raids, which came after a tip-off to police. \n \n Two of the suspects, including Abdeslam, were injured. \n \n Three of those arrested are being held on suspicion of sheltering Abdeslam and an accomplice. \n \n Play video \"Watch: Explosions At Terror Raid\" Video: Watch: Explosions At Terror Raid \n \n French president Francois Hollande and Belgian PM Charles Michel left a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on migration amid news of the raid. \n \n Later, the pair held a joint news conference in Brussels where Mr Hollande said France would ask for Abdeslam's extradition. \n \n The French leader said it was clear that the Paris attackers had links to Syria and Islamic State and the terror threat remained high. \n \n The shootout comes after Belgian authorities said that fingerprints in a Brussels apartment raided earlier this week belonged to Abdeslam. \n \n A man shot dead in that raid is believed to have been an accomplice of Abdeslam, Belgian prosecutors said on Friday. \n \n Play video \"Terror Standoff In Brussels\" Video: Terror Standoff In Brussels \n \n Sky's foreign affairs editor Sam Kiley said that Abdeslam could prove to be \"a goldmine of intelligence\". \n \n Survivors of the attack at the Bataclan venue in Paris reacted to news of the arrest this evening. \n \n Lydia Berkennou said: \"I don\u2019t know why, but deep down in my heart, I knew one of them was him. \n \n \"I knew because I didn\u2019t think he would\u2019ve managed to go back to Syria \u2026 I knew he was hiding somewhere.\" \n \n Back in November it was reported that Abdeslam had reportedly returned to Brussels with a suicide vest. \n \n Play video \"Ambulances Leave Scene In Brussels\" Video: Ambulances Leave Scene In Brussels \n \n A police source had told The Sunday Times of fears \"there is a walking bomb\" in the Belgian capital. \n \n The source said Abdeslam may have become \"trapped and desperate\" since fleeing the bloodshed which killed 130 people. \n \n After the Paris attacks, reports emerged of a row between Abdeslam and his brother Brahim, on the night before the massacre. \n \n One of their friends told a French documentary he heard one of the brothers telling the other that he was \"not going\" without money. \n \n \"The other one said: 'No, you\u2019re going!' \n \n 1 / 8 Gallery: Gallery: Paris Attacks Fugitive Captured Alive In Belgium The most wanted fugitive from November's Paris attacks has been captured \n \n \"He said to him: 'If I don't have any dosh, I\u2019m not budging.

Four other people were arrested. \n \n A man named Monir Ahmed Alaaj -- also known as Amine Choukri -- also was wounded and hospitalized, prosecutors said. \n \n Belgian federal prosecutor's office spokesman Eric Van der Sypt said the others detained included three members of a family who helped hide Abdeslam. \n \n Earlier, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel told reporters that Abdeslam, a Belgian-born French citizen, and another person were wounded in the raid. Abdeslam had a minor leg wound, Van der Sypt announced. \n \n French President Francois Hollande said Paris prosecutors will urgently request the extradition of Abdeslam. Hollande told reporters he is confident Abdeslam will be sent to France for trial. \n \n \"I know the Belgian authorities will respond quickly and favorably to our request for extradition,\" Hollande said. \n \n Officials said as of Friday night no more suspects were in the building where the raid took place. \n \n After the news broke, many others joined in with laudatory messages, including Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, where Abdeslam allegedly took part in the carnage that left 130 dead \n \n \"Congratulations to the police on the arrest of Salah Abdeslam,\" Hidalgo tweeted. \n \n Lieve Reynebeau, who works on the street where Abdeslam was captured, said she heard loud noises and then looked out to see police all around the scene.

Several members of its large, predominantly Muslim population -- many of whom are first-, second- and third-generation immigrants from North Africa -- have been linked to terror plots and attacks. \n \n Last fall, Belgian Justice Minister Koen Geens cited Molenbeek as a place where more needs to be done to address what he called Belgium's \"foreign fighter problem.\" \n \n And in the immediate aftermath of the Paris attacks, authorities conducted raids there and detained numerous individuals. One was Mohammed Abdeslam, the brother of the wanted man captured Friday, who was taken into custody and later released. \n \n JUST WATCHED Brother of Salah Abdeslam: We are shocked Replay More Videos ...

One person was killed and two people escaped that operation, according to authorities. \n \n The man killed by a special forces sniper was Mohamed Belkaid, an Algerian who used the name Samir Bouzid , and who is believed to have directed the Paris attackers via calls from Belgium, according to the prosecutor's office. \n \n Belkaid is believed to have helped Abdeslam travel prior to the attacks and transferred money to a female cousin of Paris ringleader Abdelhamid Abaaoud following the attack, the Belgian senior counter-terrorism official told CNN in January. \n \n Photos: Paris attack suspects: What we know Hide Caption 1 of 10 Photos: Paris attack suspects: What we know Hide Caption 2 of 10 Photos: Paris attack suspects: What we know Hide Caption 3 of 10 Photos: Paris attack suspects: What we know Hide Caption 4 of 10 Photos: Paris attack suspects: What we know Hide Caption 5 of 10 Photos: Paris attack suspects: What we know Hide Caption 6 of 10 Photos: Paris attack suspects: What we know Hide Caption 7 of 10 Photos: Paris attack suspects: What we know Hide Caption 8 of 10 Photos: Paris attack suspects: What we know Hide Caption 9 of 10 Photos: Paris attack suspects: What we know Hide Caption 10 of 10 \n \n Authorities believe Abdeslam was using the apartment as a hideout following the Paris attacks, according to the Belgian counter-terrorism official. \n \n His possible escape spurred an intense manhunt in a country already on guard after last fall's attacks in the French capital. \n \n Van der Sypt noted earlier this week -- prior to Friday's raid -- that authorities had searched more than 100 houses and arrested 58 people as part of the post-Paris probe. Another 23 people have been arrested \"in linked investigations,\" he said then. \n \n Suspect thought to have dropped off Paris bomber \n \n Investigators think Salah Abdeslam may have been the driver of a black Renault Clio that dropped off three suicide bombers near the Stade de France, one of the attack sites near Paris.

The surgery to relocate her heart was said to be the first successful procedure of its kind performed on a newborn child in Britain, although a few comparable cases have been reported in the United States. \n \n Her parents, Naomi Findlay, 31, and Dean Wilkins, 43, of Nottingham, England, discovered in June that they were expecting their first child. A scan at nine weeks showed ectopia cordis, with the heart and part of the stomach growing externally, the hospital said in a news release. \n \n The condition is extremely rare \u2014 estimated at five to eight cases per one million live births. \u201cBecause of the risk of infection, as well as the risks from the associated defects, pregnancies may be terminated or babies may die in the womb or soon after birth,\u201d the hospital said. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n \u201cAll the way through, it was, \u2018The chances of survival are next to none.

The relief fell out of me,\u201d said her mother. Her father said: \u201cTwenty minutes went by and she was still shouting her head off \u2013 it made us so joyful and teary.\u201d \n \n \n \n Vanellope has undergone three operations carried out by a team of 50 staff at Glenfield Hospital. Immediately after her birth, she was wrapped in a sterile plastic bag. Consultant neonatologist Jonathan Cusack said: \u201cAt around 50 minutes of age, it was felt that Vanellope was stable enough to be transferred back to the main theatre, where she had been born, to the waiting anaesthetists, congenital heart disease and paediatric surgical teams who began the task of putting her entire heart back inside her chest.\u201d \n \n \n \n She was transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit where she was due to stay for at least several weeks while she got strong enough and big enough for her heart to be placed fully within her chest and covered with her skin. \n \n \n \n After seven days, her chest was opened a bit more to create space to allow her heart to fit back in. In the average baby, there is an indent on the left lung which leaves space for the heart, but she did not have this. Over two weeks, her heart naturally made its way back into her chest as a result of gravity. \n \n \n \n I felt guilty for thinking negative thoughts because here she is fighting. I\u2019m glad I stuck to my guns not to terminate. Naomi Findlay, Vanellope\u2019s mother \n \n The latest operation involved taking skin from under her arms and moving it to join in the middle of her body. Surgeons had created a mesh that protected her heart as she did not have ribs or a sternum. As her organs fight for space inside her chest, she is still attached to a ventilation machine. \n \n Babies born with the condition \u2013 one estimate is five to eight per million \u2013 have less than a 10% chance of survival. \n \n \n \n Branko Mimic, the lead surgeon at the East Midlands Congenital Heart Centre, said: \u201cCases such as Vanellope\u2019s, where everything else appears essentially normal, are even rarer, and whilst it would seem more hopeful she will do well, it is therefore almost impossible to be confident of this.\u201d \n \n \n \n Frances Bu\u2019Lock, a consultant paediatric cardiologist at Glenfield Hospital, said she had described the chances of the baby surviving as remote. \u201cI had seen one in foetal life around 20 years ago but that pregnancy was ended.\u201d \n \n \n \n Findlay said all the way through her pregnancy that she was warned the \u201cchances of survival are next to nothing\u201d. After the birth, she said, \u201cI felt guilty for thinking negative thoughts because here she is fighting, and there was I, about to give up. I\u2019m glad I stuck to my guns not to terminate though, I\u2019m so glad.\u201d \n \n \n \n Wilkins said: \u201cI lost hope a few times, if she didn\u2019t move I\u2019d say: \u2018Has she moved today?\u2019 and then, the next thing, she\u2019d suddenly move and you\u2019d go: \u2018Oh she\u2019s heard me\u2019.\u201d \n \n \n \n They named their daughter after a character in the film Wreck-it Ralph. \u201cVanellope in the film is so stubborn and she turns into a princess at the end, so it was so fitting. The Hope part of her name is the fact that she has brought us hope, and my mum and dad, because even they, as grandparents, thought they would never get to see their granddaughter,\u201d said Findlay. \n \n \n \n Wilkins said: \u201cSome mums still terminate and if we can get out there that there is a hope, and that it can be done, then it\u2019s giving all those mums out there a chance.\u201d His daughter\u2019s name was a reminder, he said, \u201cthat there is that hope\u201d. \n \n",

Three weeks after giving birth a month prematurely, however, Findlay, 31, and Dean Wilkins, 43, are the proud parents of a baby girl believed to be the first in the UK to survive such a condition, joining a few others in the US, per the New York Times. Less than an hour after she was delivered via caesarean section on Nov. 22, Vanellope Hope Wilkins went into her first of three surgeries at Leicester's Glenfield Hospital to relocate her heart into her chest. Doctors say she's now doing well, though she remains on a ventilation machine. Getting to this point wasn't easy. After the first surgery, doctors had to wait for Vanellope's chest to grow to make room for the heart. With doctors assisting, the heart eventually moved into a cavity through gravity. Doctors then created a mesh to protect the heart, as Vanellope was born without ribs or a sternum, and in the final surgery, they covered the hole with skin taken from under the infant's arms. \"In a way her strength gave me a strength to keep going,\" Findlay tells the BBC. \"No one believed she was going to make it except us,\" adds Wilkins. \"It's beyond a miracle.\" A pediatric cardiologist says Vanellope \"has proved very resilient.\" The main focus now is to prevent infection, but \"in the future we may be able to put in some internal bony protection for her heart, perhaps using 3D printing or something organic that would grow with her.\" (Heart surgery saved an unborn child in Canada.)",

Il Pm Mignini gli chiese com\u2019era vestita la Knox. Quintavalle non esit\u00f2: \u00abCon un cappotto grigio\u00bb, disse. Forse il negoziante, che si present\u00f2 a deporre un anno dopo la morte di Mez, aveva visto la foto del 3 novembre, e fece confusione, mischi\u00f2 ricordi e ritagli di giornale.

I really want to see her': Foxy Knoxy's Italian lover breaks his silence to reveal their 'four years in circle of hell' \n \n Raffaele Sollecito said the pair speak to each other on the phone every day to 'try and understand what happened' \n \n \n \n He is already planning a trip to Seattle to see his former girlfriend \n \n He says: 'I really want to see her again and look into her eyes' \n \n Freed Amanda Knox is in regular contact with her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, he has revealed in an interview. \n \n The couple were sensationally cleared of murdering and sexually assaulting student Meredith Kercher, 21, who was found semi-naked and with her throat cut in her bedroom of the house she shared with Knox, 24. \n \n She and Sollecito, 27, had been seeing each other for a week before the brutal murder and initially they had been sentenced to 26 and 25 years respectively but they were released on appeal earlier this month. \n \n Contact: Amanda Knox, pictured in Seattle last week, is in regular contact with her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, left, he has revealed in an interview. He is planning to visit her in Seattle before Christmas \n \n \n \n Breaking his silence for the first time in an interview with glossy Italian weekly Oggi, computer studies graduate Sollecito said: 'We need each other - we speak to each other on the phone and write to each other every day.' \n \n \n \n Then, speaking of his invitation to visit Knox in her hometown of Seattle, Sollecito added: 'I will certainly go and see Amanda. She asked me over and I accepted with pleasure and there is no saying I will wait until Christmas. \n \n 'I could go earlier - I could go at any moment. I really want to see her again, to speak with her and look into her eyes. \n \n Knox and Sollecito were photographed kissing shortly after the death of Meredith Kercher \n \n 'We need to speak and write to each other to try and understand what happened to us and to look forward to a future that appeared broken forever but instead we can still build on. \n \n 'We have so many things to say to each other. We spent four years in a circle of hell, we suffered unspeakably and it ruined our lives.' \n \n Knox has kept a low profile since she was freed and is said to be negotiating a money-spinning TV interview deal with an American TV network which could make her $1 million - with the potential of earning up to ten times that amount as well. \n \n Since returning to Seattle she has been seen out and about with friends but generally keeping a low profile and spending time with her family. \n \n \n \n The couple pictured in 2007. Sollecito said: 'We have so many things to say to each other. We spent four years in a circle of hell, we suffered unspeakably and it ruined our lives.' \n \n She was pictured out in downtown Seattle earlier this month with best friend Madison Paxton, who stayed close to her while she was in prison, and days earlier taking a drive with her step-father Chris Mellas. \n \n \n \n She wrote in prison of how she longed to see her former boyfriend, David Johnsrud, and he was one of the first to pay her a visit on her return, although her father Curt stressed their relationship was now one simply of \u2018friendship\u2019. \n \n Asked how his daughter had changed since she was jailed, Mr Knox said in an interview earlier this month that she was little different, other than occasionally slipping into speaking Italian and being less trusting of authority after her experience with Italian police. \u2018It\u2019s almost like she hasn\u2019t lost a step with the family, which is nice to see,\u2019 he said. \n \n \n \n Freed: Knox addresses supporters and the media at Seattle airport supported by her mother Edda Mellas following her sensational release from prison \n \n He said his daughter had to remain largely indoors for the moment, describing it as \u2018a different version of jail\u2019 but said she had at least been able to lie down in the grass \u2013 something she had longed for while in prison. \n \n Mr Knox also revealed his daughter was being shadowed by a bodyguard and the family has been inundated with hate mail and threatening phone calls. \n \n Knox and Sollecito, from Bisceglie near Bari, were originally found guilty in 2009 of the murder which had taken two years previously in the Italian hilltop town of Perugia. \n \n However the appeal heard how the original evidence used to convict them was flawed and contaminated and they were freed after an independent forensic report ordered by the judge condemned the forensic investigation. \n \n Jailed: Ivory Coast drifter Rudy Guede, 24, (left) was convicted of the murder and sexual assault of Meredith Kercher (right) after a fast-track trial in 2008 \n \n Key to the case was a 30cm kitchen knife found in Sollecito's apartment and on which was said to be DNA from Knox on the handle and that of Meredith on the blade. \n \n But the report said the amount on the knife was so low is should not be used to convict Knox - although they confirmed it was her DNA on the handle but she argued she had used it to cook with. \n \n DNA from Sollecito which was found on Meredith's bloodied bra clasp was also dismissed as it emerged it had been left in the murder scene for six weeks before being collected and leaving it open to contamination. \n \n Prosecutors in Perugia have said they will appeal the decision but they will have to wait until the judge's written ruling on the verdict is published sometime in the New Year. \n \n Meredith from Coulsdon, Surrey, was a Leeds University student and was in Perugia for her degree course and she had only been in Italy for two months before she was murdered in November 2007. \n \n Ivory Coast drifter Rudy Guede, 24, was convicted of murder and sexual assault after a fast track trial in 2008 and originally sentenced to 30 years but this was later reduced to 16 on appeal. \n \n \n \n",

    "document": "\"You slide down in your seat and make yourself comfortable. On the screen in front of you, the movie image appears\u2014enormous and overwhelming. If the movie is a good one, you allow yourself to be absorbed in its fantasy, and its dreams become part of your memories\" \n \n Roger Ebert wrote those words in 1980 for The Atlantic magazine, a love letter to the medium that became his employer: the movies. After a 46-year tenure as film critic for the Chicago Sun-Times, several decades hosting a hugely influential television show, a landmark Pulitzer Prize, and countless thumbs in both directions, Ebert died Thursday at age 70. \n \n He loved the movies, and loved writing about them\u2014and he was damned good at writing about them. His reviews were a unique combination of scholarly, witty, occasionally sarcastic, and masterfully entertaining. His ability to craft an exhilarating rave of a film was equally matched by his stinging zingers. As we remember him, here\u2019s a look back at what one lifelong admirer considers his 10 best reviews. Plus, no retrospective on Ebert\u2019s work would be complete without a roundup of his most biting takedowns. \n \n E.T.\u2014The Extra-Terrestrial \n \n \u201cThis movie made my heart glad. It is filled with innocence, hope, and good cheer. It is also wickedly funny and exciting as hell. E.T.\u2014The Extra-Terrestrial is a movie like The Wizard of Oz, that you can grow up with and grow old with, and it won't let you down. It tells a story about friendship and love. Some people are a little baffled when they hear it described: It's about a relationship between a little boy and a creature from outer space that becomes his best friend. That makes it sound like a cross between The Thing and National Velvet. It works as science fiction, it's sometimes as scary as a monster movie, and at the end, when the lights go up, there's not a dry eye in the house.\u201d \n \n \u2014March 22, 2002 \n \n Casablanca \n \n \u201cIf we identify strongly with the characters in some movies, then it is no mystery that Casablanca is one of the most popular films ever made. It is about a man and a woman who are in love, and who sacrifice love for a higher purpose. This is immensely appealing; the viewer is not only able to imagine winning the love of Humphrey Bogart or Ingrid Bergman, but unselfishly renouncing it, as a contribution to the great cause of defeating the Nazis\u2026 \n \n Seeing the film over and over again, year after year, I find it never grows over-familiar. It plays like a favorite musical album; the more I know it, the more I like it. The black-and-white cinematography has not aged as color would. The dialogue is so spare and cynical it has not grown old-fashioned. Much of the emotional effect of Casablanca is achieved by indirection; as we leave the theater, we are absolutely convinced that the only thing keeping the world from going crazy is that the problems of three little people do after all amount to more than a hill of beans.\u201d \n \n \u2014September 15, 1996 \n \n Toy Story \n \n \u201cToy Story creates a universe out of a couple of kids\u2019 bedrooms, a gas station, and a stretch of suburban highway. Its heroes are toys, which come to life when nobody is watching. Its conflict is between an old-fashioned cowboy who has always been a little boy's favorite toy, and the new space ranger who may replace him. The villain is the mean kid next door who takes toys apart and puts them back together again in macabre combinations. And the result is a visionary roller-coaster ride of a movie. \n \n Get The Beast In Your Inbox! Daily Digest Start and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.

Older viewers may be even more absorbed, because Toy Story, the first feature made entirely by computer, achieves a three-dimensional reality and freedom of movement that is liberating and new. The more you know about how the movie was made, the more you respect it.\u201d \n \n \u2014November 22, 1995 \n \n Raging Bull \n \n \u201cMartin Scorsese's Raging Bull is a movie about brute force, anger, and grief. It is also, like several of Scorsese's other movies, about a man's inability to understand a woman except in terms of the only two roles he knows how to assign her: virgin or whore. There is no room inside the mind of the prizefighter in this movie for the notion that a woman might be a friend, a lover, or a partner. She is only, to begin with, an inaccessible sexual fantasy. And then, after he has possessed her, she becomes tarnished by sex. Insecure in his own manhood, the man becomes obsessed by jealousy\u2014and releases his jealousy in violence\u2026 \n \n The equation between his prizefighting and his sexuality is inescapable, and we see the trap he's in: LaMotta is the victim of base needs and instincts that, in his case, are not accompanied by the insights and maturity necessary for him to cope with them. The raging bull. The poor sap.\u201d \n \n \u2014January 1, 1980 \n \n Platoon \n \n \u201cIt was Francois Truffaut who said that it's not possible to make an anti-war movie, because all war movies, with their energy and sense of adventure, end up making combat look like fun. If Truffaut had lived to see Platoon, the best film of 1986, he might have wanted to modify his opinion. Here is a movie that regards combat from ground level, from the infantryman's point of view, and it does not make war look like fun.\u201d \n \n \u2014December 30, 1986 \n \n Beauty and the Beast \n \n \"Beauty and the Beast slipped around all my roadblocks and penetrated directly into my strongest childhood memories, in which animation looked more real than live-action features. Watching the movie, I found myself caught up in a direct and joyous way. I wasn't reviewing an 'animated film.' I was being told a story, I was hearing terrific music, and I was having fun. The film is as good as any Disney animated feature ever made\u2014as magical as Pinocchio, Snow White, The Little Mermaid. And it's a reminder that animation is the ideal medium for fantasy, because all of its fears and dreams can be made literal.\" \n \n \u2014November 22, 1991 \n \n Titanic \n \n \u201cJames Cameron\u2019s 194-minute, $200 million film of the tragic voyage is in the tradition of the great Hollywood epics. It is flawlessly crafted, intelligently constructed, strongly acted, and spellbinding. If its story starts well within the traditional formulas for such pictures, well, you don\u2019t choose the most expensive film ever made as your opportunity to reinvent the wheel. \u2026 \n \n Movies like this are not merely difficult to make at all, but almost impossible to make well. The technical difficulties are so daunting that it\u2019s a wonder when the filmmakers are also able to bring the drama and history into proportion. I found myself convinced by both story and saga.\u201d \n \n \u2014December 19, 1997 \n \n Hoop Dreams \n \n \u201cA film like Hoop Dreams is what the movies are for. It takes us, shakes us, and makes us think in new ways about the world around us. It gives us the impression of having touched life itself. \n \n Hoop Dreams is, on one level, a documentary about two black kids named William Gates and Arthur Agee, from Chicago\u2019s inner city, who are gifted basketball players and dream of someday starring in the NBA. On another level, it is about much larger subjects: about ambition, competition, race, and class in our society. About our value structures. And about the daily lives of people like the Agee and Gates families, who are unusually invisible to the mass media, but have a determination and resiliency that is a cause for hope.\u201d \n \n \u2014October 21, 1994 \n \n Star Wars \n \n \u201cEvery once in a while I have what I think of as an out-of-the-body experience at a movie. When the ESP people use a phrase like that, they're referring to the sensation of the mind actually leaving the body and spiriting itself off to China or Peoria or a galaxy far, far away. When I use the phrase, I simply mean that my imagination has forgotten it is actually present in a movie theater and thinks it's up there on the screen. In a curious sense, the events in the movie seem real, and I seem to be a part of them. \n \n Star Wars works like that. My list of other out-of-the-body films is a short and odd one, ranging from the artistry of Bonnie and Clyde or Cries and Whispers to the slick commercialism of Jaws and the brutal strength of Taxi Driver. On whatever level (sometimes I'm not at all sure) they engage me so immediately and powerfully that I lose my detachment, my analytical reserve. The movie's happening, and it's happening to me.\u201d \n \n \u2014January 1, 1977 \n \n Fargo \n \n \u201cFargo begins with an absolutely dead-on familiarity with small-town life in the frigid winter landscape of Minnesota and North Dakota. Then it rotates its story through satire, comedy, suspense and violence, until it emerges as one of the best films I've ever seen. \n \n To watch it is to experience steadily mounting delight, as you realize the filmmakers have taken enormous risks, gotten away with them and made a movie that is completely original, and as familiar as an old shoe\u2014or a rubbersoled hunting boot from Land's End, more likely.\u201d \n \n \u2014March 8, 1996 \n \n Ebert\u2019s Best Burns \n \n \"Was there no one connected with this project who read the screenplay, considered the story, evaluated the proposed film and vomited?\" \n \n \u2014from Last Rites review, November 19, 1988 \n \n \"This is an old idea, beautifully expressed by Wordsworth, who said, 'Heaven lies about us in our infancy.' If I could quote the whole poem instead of completing this review, believe me, we'd all be happier. But I press on.\" \n \n \u2014from Baby Geniuses review, March 12, 1999 \n \n \u201cI will one day be thin, but Vincent Gallo will always be the director of The Brown Bunny.\u201d \n \n \u2014from The Brown Bunny review, September 3, 2004 \n \n \u201cWatching Mad Dog Time is like waiting for the bus in a city where you're not sure they have a bus line.\" \n \n \u2014from Mad Dog Time review, November 29, 1996 \n \n \"Valentine's Day is being marketed as a Date Movie. I think it's more of a First-Date Movie. If your date likes it, do not date that person again. And if you like it, there may not be a second date.\" \n \n \u2014from Valentine\u2019s Day review, February 10, 2010 \n \n \"Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo makes a living cleaning fish tanks and occasionally prostituting himself. How much he charges I'm not sure, but the price is worth it if it keeps him off the streets and out of another movie.\" \n \n \u2014from Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo review, August 12, 2005 \n \n \"There is a movie called Fargo playing right now. It is a masterpiece. Go see it. If you, under any circumstances, see Little Indian, Big City, I will never let you read one of my reviews again.\" \n \n \u2014from Little Indian, Big City review, March 22, 1996 \n \n \"Battlefield Earth is like taking a bus trip with someone who has needed a bath for a long time. It's not merely bad; it's unpleasant in a hostile way.\" \n \n \u2014from Battlefield Earth review, May 12, 2000 \n \n \"If you want to save yourself the ticket price, go into the kitchen, cue up a male choir singing the music of hell, and get a kid to start banging pots and pans together. Then close your eyes and use your imagination.\" \n \n \u2014from Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen review, June 23, 2009 \n \n \"I hated this movie. Hated, hated, hated, hated, hated this movie.

\n \n >> there was never a time when anyone told me i would never speak again. naturally, i felt awful. but i had to accept reality. \n \n >> a reality that included a new voice. and when ebert blogs, over 100 million people are reading. no surprise, last year, he was awarded a webby for person of the year. \n \n >> the conversations that you have with your readers online, writing your blogs, how much is that like sitting down at the dinner table with you, roger ebert ? \n \n >> with facebook, twitter and the comments on my blog, i feel i'm involved in an actual conversation with me, the social media really are social. \n \n >> but his bluntness online took some heat this summer, after \"jackass\" star, ryan dunn 's deadly crash. dunn had posted this photo of himself drinking before the accident. ebert tweeted -- friends don't let jackasses drink and drive. he later explained in his blog, i was probably too quick to tweet. but recently told us, the tweet was the truth. for ebert , honesty is the best policy. even when it's about his own appearance. \n \n >> you say the best thing that happened to you was when they showed a full-page photo of what you look like now in \"esquire\" magazine. why is that? \n \n >> well, this is what i look like, so there's no purpose in hiding it. what you see is what you get. \n \n >> your memories growing up are so descriptive about having root beers and frosty mugs with your father. \n \n >> i find that when i am actually writing, memories appear in my mind. \n \n >> vivid childhood memories , he writes i was born inside the movie of my life. he describes a good life. eating steakburgers at the steak and shake and chuckles candies at the movies. a childhood as american as a normal rockwell painting. \n \n >> i was always extroverted. now i am forced to live more within my mind. \n \n >> a beautiful day . \n \n >> ebert credits his wife of 20 years for encouraging him to keep going. he writes, she was like a wind pushing me back from the grave. \n \n >> chaz is a force of nature . when she decides on something, her determination is awesome. she knew i could still work as a film critic and she was right. she has done a great deal to make that possible. \n \n >> ebert still travels to film festivals , attends at least five screenings a week, and with his wife, chaz, produces \" ebert presents at the movies.\" \n \n >> gene siskel , who you spent 23 years with, you two had a little bit of that love/hate relationship. \n \n >> it's thiler week on \" siskel and ebert week at the movies.\" \n \n >> you said if you had a sitcom it would be called \"best enemies.\" he really was like a brother to you. if he were alive today, what woe say to you now? \n \n >> he would have been wholehearted in my corner through the troubles. although as a way of life we shared a deep understanding of one another. he would also have continued to make jokes about me. well, at least you don't need a bookmark any more to find your chin. \n \n >> well, we saw roger walking in and they said, one of everything to go. \n \n >> you once asked your doctor to put coca-cola through your g-tube. why? \n \n >> i still have cokes once in a while . i like a caffeine. \n \n >> these guys, right? this is eventage. \n \n >> while ebert may be robbed of his ability to eat and drink, he still enjoys some guilty pleasures. two thumbs up. there's a beautiful passage in the book, really talks about how roger looks at life and ha he's been through. can you read that for me? \n \n >> we must try to contribute joy to the world . that is true no matter what our problems, our health, our circumstances. we must try. i didn't always know this, and i'm happy i lived long enough to find it out. \n \n >> i feel i'm lucky that i can still do what i love, and be of some use to people. it's a waste of time feeling sorry for yourself. because it doesn't change anything or help anything. you just have to keep on keeping on. \n \n >> and matt, one thing that roger ebert told me is that a lot of people say he's courageous for continuing to do and be busier than ever. but in fact, he says, that's not the case. because he continues to be the same person. he's just doing what he always did. don't call him courageous. \n \n >> a remarkable guy. \n \n >> he really is. so vibrant.",

    "document": "CAPE ELIZABETH \u2014 Oh boy. \n \n That\u2019s what crossed Jesse Orach\u2019s mind when he tried to stand up at the finish line of the Beach to Beacon 10K in sight Saturday morning. The 23-year-old Gorham native was leading the field of Maine runners when he collapsed from heat stroke. \n \n \u201cIt kind of seemed like it was over for me,\u201d said Orach, who finished first among Maine men in last year\u2019s race. \u201cThen, I felt someone pick me up.\u201d \n \n Compiled images by Staff Photographer Ben McCanna \n \n Robert Gomez, Orach\u2019s top competitor from Maine, helped him to his feet. Gomez, 34, of Windham held Orach up as they ran together to the finish line, and Gomez gave him a nudge over the line. Both men completed the 6.2-mile course in 31 minutes, 31 seconds. \n \n \u201cHe ran a better race.

And despite helping the competition, Gomez beat his previous best Beach to Beacon finish of third place in 2010. \n \n Gomez said he stuck with Orach for the first mile before falling about 30 seconds behind, unable to keep up. He didn\u2019t see Orach again until rounding a turn for the final stretch, where Orach lay in the grass amid a growing crowd of medical personnel. \n \n \u201cFor a split second I kept going until I looked and saw it was Jesse,\u201d Gomez said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t leave him there.

Gomez pushed him across the line, and Orach collapsed for the second time. \n \n \u201cIt was scary. I\u2019ve never seen him look like that,\u201d said Orach\u2019s mother, Brenda, who didn\u2019t get to see her son win the Maine division in 2016.

He said his core temperature peaked at 107.3 degrees. \n \n \u201cI\u2019ve felt better,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cThere was a lot of pressure, which could have played a factor in how the race ended.

The pair had only met each other the day before at the prerace press conference. \n \n \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to say,\u201d Orach said. \u201cHe got me to the finish line.\u201d \n \n Liam Simpson of Cape Elizabeth (32:22) finished third among Maine men. \n \n Rich Hickey, a finish-line referee, said a runner may be disqualified for receiving physical assistance or providing it to another runner. \n \n \u201cSo do you disqualify them both?\u201d Hickey asked rhetorically. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to disqualify anybody.\u201d \n \n For Maine women, Emily Durgin placed first in 34:43. The Cheverus High and recent UConn graduate from Standish will be joining a New Balance team that trains in Boston. \n \n \u201cThis was actually my final year running as a Maine resident, so it\u2019s a big honor,\u201d Durgin said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to run a fast race. It was a strategic race.\u201d \n \n Durgin was paced by last year\u2019s champion, Michelle Lilienthal of Portland, who finished second in 35:11. \n \n Lilienthal, 35, was competing without an injury for the first time in three years. A broken foot kept her out of the race in 2015, and she won in 2016 despite an Achilles injury. \n \n \u201cGoing in last year, I was definitely on the upswing even though I was undertrained,\u201d Lilienthal said. \n \n \u201cThis year I felt super confident because I felt fit, but I just didn\u2019t have that last mile. Emily made a move, and I was like, \u2018You gotta go now,\u2019 and it just wasn\u2019t there.\u201d \n \n Lilienthal led for the first five miles before Durgin surged ahead. \n \n \u201cI just ran right behind her,\u201d Durgin said. \u201cI took off up that last hill and tried to hold on.

Eugene Griffith said. \n \n The final shot missed the fleeing teen. \n \n The younger Blackwell, who just graduated from New Smyrna Beach High where he was a star weightlifter, had just broken up a fight between his father and his mother, Windy Blackwell, Griffith said, and the elder Blackwell was not pleased with the interference. \n \n \u201cHe shot his son four times,\u201d Griffith said Monday morning. \u201cIt escalated after the mother left the house.\u201d \n \n The elder Blackwell was arrested early Monday and charged with attempted first-degree murder. He was being held without bail Monday at the Volusia County Branch Jail. \n \n Neighbor Richard Tredeaux told investigators that after he heard the initial gunfire coming from the Blackwell house, he saw Blackwell Jr. running from the residence.

He heard another gunshot and then the elder Blackwell yelled out, \u201cYeah (expletive deleted) how do you like that?\u201d the arrest report states. \n \n Griffith said Blackwell Jr. was airlifted to Halifax Health Medical Center in Daytona Beach in critical condition. He was listed in satisfactory condition on Monday, said Tangela Boyd, hospital spokeswoman. \n \n Sgt.

According to the arrest report, Blackwell Sr. grabbed his wife by the neck after he asked her whether she had been talking to a man named \u201cFrank.\u201d \n \n Windy Blackwell, 42, told police the family had a pleasant Father\u2019s Day. She told police her husband then went out to visit a friend and that when he returned he started asking her about \u201cFrank.\u201d Windy Blackwell denied talking to anyone named \u201cFrank,\u201d but did tell her husband that she wants a divorce, the report states.

There are two other children in the family, but Windy Blackwell said they were not home when the fight erupted. \n \n The mother told police that Blackwell Jr. told her to leave the house. After she left reluctantly, Blackwell Sr. turned on his son, Griffith said.

She talked to Blackwell Jr. before he was taken away and he told her that he was fine, the report states. \n \n Blackwell Sr. had taken off in his Dodge pickup, police said.

It was an apparent response to European officials threatening policy changes of their own in the wake of Trump's sudden pronouncement on metal imports. \n \n \"If the E.U. wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on U.S. companies doing business there, we will simply apply a tax on their cars which freely pour into the U.S.,\" the president said on Twitter. \n \n That could spell trouble for car manufacturers like Volkswagen and BMW, two of the most popular European brands sold in the U.S. The German luxury car maker also manufactures many of its cars in America, shipping billions of dollars worth abroad. \n \n In 2016, the EU shipped more than 6 million cars abroad, and the U.S. \u2014 its largest market by far \u2014 absorbed more than 1 million of those, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. \n \n Each year, the U.S. imports more from Europe than the continent absorbs in American goods, to the tune of a trade deficit totaling more than $151 billion in 2017, according to U.S. Census data. \n \n Trump's hasty decision to impose tariffs on steel imports has stoked talk of a brewing trade war, roiling both the political establishment and the global economic order. The move also prompted E.U. trade chiefs to weigh hitting a broad array of U.S. imports with a 25 percent tax, Reuters reported this week. \n \n ||||| CLOSE President Donald Trump said trade wars were \"good,\" expressing defiance amid global criticism of his plan to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Newslook \n \n President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump. (Photo: Chuck Burton, AP) \n \n In the first rumblings of a potential trade war, President Trump punched back Saturday at Canadian and European warnings that his steel tariff plan is \"unacceptable\" by threatening to slap a tariff on European cars if they try to take him on. \n \n The latest volley out of Mar-a-Lago came two days after Trump first announced plans to impose a U.S. tariff of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum. \n \n That, in turn, was met by a sharp rejection from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau who called the tariffs \"absolutely unacceptable\" and said they would cause serious disruption of markets on both sides of the border. \n \n If the E.U. wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on U.S. companies doing business there, we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the U.S. They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there.

Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, told the German media that the EU would respond with tariffs on such U.S. products as Harley-Davidsons, Kentucky bourbon and bluejeans. \n \n \u201cNone of this is reasonable, but reason is a sentiment that is very unevenly distributed in this world,\u201d Juncker said. \n \n From his weekend perch, Trump made it clear that such talk would only stoke American resolve. \n \n \"If the E.U. wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on U.S. companies doing business there, we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the U.S.,\" he tweeted. \"They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there. Big trade imbalance!\" \n \n The tweet underscored his observation on Friday that when the U.S.is losing \"many billions\" on trade with virtually every trading partner \"trade wars are good and easy to win.\" \n \n Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries, warns that Trump was risking a \u201cspiral of protectionism\u201d that in the end would cost American jobs, as well as those in Germany and the rest of Europe, The New York Times reported. \n \n For now, Canada was feeling the most acute pressure as the top supplier to the United States of both steel and aluminum, exporting nearly 90% of its steel to the U.S. \n \n \"Any disruption to this integrated market would be significant and serious, Trudeau said. \n \n Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stands during question period on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Feb. 28, 2018. (Photo: Sean Kilpatrick, AP) \n \n These proposals, he added, \"are going to hurt them every bit as much as they are going to hurt us, and we are confident we're going to continue to be able to defend Canadian industry.\" \n \n While Trump has routinely singled out China for its steel and aluminum exports to the U.S., the president, in his off-the-cuff remarks on Thursday, did not say specifically whether Canada and/or Mexico would be subject to the new measures. \n \n If he aims only at China, however, he would hit a mighty small target since China accounts for only 2.9% of U.S. steel imports. \n \n Canada, on the other hand, is the biggest supplier, accounting for 16% of U.S. steel imports, or $4.3 billion in 2017, followed by South Korea, Mexico, Brazil and China, according to data compiled by Wood Mackenzie. \n \n The Wall Street Journal, quoting an unidentified senior White House official, reports that Trump plans to apply his tariffs globally and won't exempt allies such as Canada and Europe. \n \n That is hardly surprising, given Trump's ire in the past over Canada's export policies. \n \n Last year, in a flareup over milk pricing and softwood lumber, the president took a swipe at the neighbors to the north, warning people not to be fooled by Canadians' friendly demeanor, the The Globe and Mail reported. \n \n \"Canada's been very rough on the United States.

He is also an associate professor of East Asian politics, University of Houston-Downtown. The views expressed here are solely his. \n \n (CNN) Yulin's dog meat \"festival,\" where some 10,000 dogs are slaughtered and served up as meals, is often wrongly assumed to be an ancient Chinese tradition. \n \n In fact, the festival only dates back to 2009 when it was launched in the city in China's southwest to celebrate the summer solstice. \n \n The consumption of dog meat does have historical precedence in China. \n \n At its height during the Han Dynasty (202 - 220 AD), dog meat was considered a delicacy. \n \n Yet, dog eating soon lost favor and by the Sui-Tang dynasties (581 -- 907 AD), dog eating had been rejected as an indecent habit. \n \n Subsequent dynasties valued dogs as helpers and hunting buddies. \n \n Losing battle? \n \n In the 21st century, dog eating is facing strong criticism inside China. Three decades of economic expansion has spawned a growing army of animal lovers and pet owners believed to be 30 million strong. \n \n Of China's estimated 130 million dogs, at least 27 million are urban pets, according to research group Euromonitor. \n \n As more young people move into the cities, they look to companion animals for comfort in the absence of the family unit. \n \n With their new found bond with animals, this new generation of Chinese see cats and dogs as thinking, feeling individuals deserving of compassion. Most importantly, they are friends not food. \n \n I believe the dog meat industry is fighting a losing battle. \n \n My own investigations and those of Chinese activists and journalists all confirm its downward spiral as the cruelty involved is exposed. \n \n Guangzhou, a city well known for eating dogs, cats and exotic wildlife, just closed a dog meat restaurant that had been in operation for 51 years, according to local reports. \n \n Likewise, brutal dog slaughter used to be everywhere in Beijing's suburbs less than 10 years ago, but it has now virtually disappeared. \n \n In 2011, local authorities shut down the Jinghua Dog Meat Festival following nationwide condemnation. \n \n JUST WATCHED Inside China's dog meat 'festival' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Inside China's dog meat 'festival' 01:23 \n \n How long can Yulin authorities remain defiant of Chinese and international public opinion? \n \n Rabies risk \n \n The dog meat trade is a serious threat to human health, and Chinese authorities have every reason to stand by the animal advocates. \n \n China has the world's second highest incidence of rabies in humans. And according to China's ministry for public health , Guangxi province, where Yulin is located, has the largest number of cases in China, while Yulin is one of China's \"top ten cities\" for cases of human rabies. \n \n Eating dog meat of itself does not cause rabies, but the handling and slaughter of vast numbers of unvaccinated dogs exposes the traders to a high risk of rabies infection. \n \n Transporting the dogs to the festival is an intrinsically brutal operation. Dogs for Yulin come from as far as central and north China's Henan and Shandong, more than 1,000 miles away. \n \n They are crammed into wire cages unable to extend their limbs, denied food and water for days during the exhausting trip. The dogs arrive at their destination malnourished and underweight, dehydrated, often dying from injuries or from being poisoned during capture. Others are already dead. \n \n Food safety disaster \n \n This isn't solely an animal welfare issue; it's also a food safety disaster. \n \n China's food safety regulations ban the processing, selling and serving of products from diseased or dead animals of unknown causes. \n \n And yet the Yulin authorities seemingly ignore these rules, allowing dog meat from unknown sources to be sold to consumers, and in so doing prioritizing the profits of dog meat traders over consumer health. \n \n When contacted by CNN, a spokesperson for the local food and drug administration declined to answer any questions. \n \n JUST WATCHED Dog meat festival in China sparks outrage Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Dog meat festival in China sparks outrage 03:21 \n \n The average Chinese citizen finds public dog slaughter inexcusably offensive. \n \n Dogs are openly killed in crowded marketplaces, on the streets, and most shockingly next to elementary schools, imposing bloody and cruel practices on vulnerable members of the public. \n \n Such public slaughter risks creating an indifferent and morally defunct society. \n \n Beating and killing these struggling, crying dogs in full view of other terrified dogs showcases an industry that is devoid of humanity. \n \n Additionally, the criminal activity of dog theft sustains much of the dog meat industry, with often violent confrontations between angry dog owners and the thieves. \n \n Changing culture \n \n Protesters gather to demonstrate against dog meat trade in China. \n \n Opposition to dog eating is not about interfering in the food choices of dog meat eaters, nor a challenge to Chinese culture. \n \n No culture is stagnant; it evolves and progresses. \n \n During my most recent trip to Yulin in May, I sat down to have tea with five dog meat traders. I asked them if they wanted their children to step into their shoes. They answered a resounding \"No.\" \n \n Their children were ashamed of their parents' profession. The 19-year-old son of one trader asked: \"Why are you doing this, out of all the jobs out there?\" \n \n It is a question resounding throughout China, and the authorities need to listen.",

It was the first time Beyonce, a Houston native, performed at the country awards show. The performance also marked a return for the Dixie Chicks, who hadn't attended the CMA Awards in some time. \n \n \"Everybody get on your feet.

    "document": "The statue of Jefferson Davis, once president of the Confederate States, stands just south of the Main Building on UT's campus on June 22, 2015. \n \n Editor's note: This story has been updated throughout. \n \n Just days after an advisory panel recommended the University of Texas at Austin relocate some or all of its statues of Confederate leaders, UT-Austin President Gregory Fenves announced that the statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis will soon have a new home. \n \n UT is relocating the Davis statue to an exhibit in the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History. Four other statues the panel considered relocating \u2014 including ones of Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Albert Sidney Johnston \u2014 will remain on the university\u2019s South Mall, but Fenves will consider adding explanatory plaques to place them in historical context. \n \n \u201cWhile every historical figure leaves a mixed legacy, I believe Jefferson Davis is in a separate category,\u201d Fenves wrote in a letter to the UT-Austin community, \u201cand that it is not in the university\u2019s best interest to continue commemorating him. Davis had few ties to Texas; he played a unique role in the history of the American South that is best explained and understood through an educational exhibit.\u201d \n \n The statue of former U.S. President Woodrow Wilson will also be relocated to another outdoor location, but for symmetrical reasons: He stands opposite Davis on South Mall. The Davis statue will likely be removed in the next two days, UT-Austin spokesman Gary Susswein said. It will be refurbished and relocated to the Briscoe Center in the next 18 months. \n \n In June, Fenves assembled a 12-member panel of students, professors and alumni to assess the appropriateness of the statues. The panel solicited more than 3,100 opinions from the public and released its recommendations Monday. Its report presented five options, four of which involved moving some or all of the statues to a history center on campus. Another option would have left the statues in place but called for explanatory plaques. \n \n UT-Austin student government President Xavier Rotnofsky and Vice President Rohit Mandalapu made removal of the Davis statue a central part of their platform when running for office. Both served on the advisory panel and said they were happy to see their goal achieved. \n \n \"If there is a statue to be relocated it should be Jefferson Davis, the leader of the Confederacy,\" Mandalapu said. \"Now it can be moved to a place where it can be contextualized and studied within the scope of history.\" \n \n The other Confederate statues of Lee, Johnston and Confederate Postmaster General John Reagan \u2014 and one of former Texas Gov. James Hogg \u2014 have strong ties to Texas, Fenves said in his letter, noting Lee's legacy \"should not be reduced to his role in the Civil War.\" \n \n Moving the Davis statue, while leaving the other four in place is a respectful decision that still honors the heritage of the United States and the university, Fenves said. \n \n The Davis statue has been the most controversial of the ones commemorating Confederate leaders. In March, the student assembly passed a resolution asking UT to remove the statue of Davis. In April, it was vandalized with the phrase \u201cDavis Must Fall.\u201d A week after June's deadly shooting at a black church in South Carolina, the statues of Davis, Lee and Johnston were tagged with the phrase \u201cBlack Lives Matter.\u201d \n \n \"Statues have layers of meaning: aesthetic, historical, aspirational and educational. History is not innocent; it is the living foundation for the present,\" the report said. \"The university\u2019s approach to changing and replacing monuments on campus should be conservative but not uncritical.\" \n \n While applauding UT's decision, state Sens. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, and Judith Zaffirini, D-Laredo reiterated their call for examination of Confederate monuments on the Capitol grounds. \n \n \"We hope the conversation at UT will encourage state leaders to have a similar debate about the numerous Confederate statues that dot the Capitol grounds,\" they said in a statement. \"We renew our previous request \u2014 one that's been echoed by many legislators, both Democrat and Republican \u2014 to create a task force to begin a serious conversation about how best to honor Texas' past, ensure historical accuracy and celebrate figures who are relevant to our state and worthy of our praise.\" \n \n Disclosure: The University of Texas at Austin is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.

Lee\u2019s complicated legacy to Texas and the nation should not be reduced to his role in the Civil War.\u201d \n \n Fenves said he will consider placing a plaque on the Littlefield Fountain to explain the context behind the four remaining statues. \n \n \u201cThis combination of locating the Jefferson Davis statue in a center devoted to history and keeping the remaining statues along the Main Mall is both respectful of the heritage that is important to many and serves as a poignant display of our nation\u2019s and university\u2019s history,\u201d Fenves wrote. \n \n To preserve symmetry on campus, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson will be moved to another exterior location on campus. Currently Wilson and Davis sit atop the main mall together, overseeing UT\u2019s South Mall lawn. \n \n Earlier this week, a task force formed to study the statues released a report that offered up five solutions for the statues, which have garnered controversy. Just one would have left the statues where they are located, but the task force wrote that this option could prolong the controversy. \n \n Fenves\u2019 decision is the latest in a series of backlashes the Confederate symbol has faced nationwide since Dylann Roof, the white suspect in the fatal shootings at a black church in Charleston. S.C., was shown in a photo with the Confederate battle flag. \n \n This is a developing story \u2014 check back later for updates.",

    "document": "When a crime occurs in the physical world, investigators search for specific types of evidence. \n \n Say they're looking into a robbery. Where was the break-in point? Was a weapon used? \n \n SEE ALSO: More than 10 million devices helped take down the internet on Friday \n \n At Dyn, the domain name service-provider hit with a massive distributed denial of service attack on Friday that shut down a huge chunk of the internet, the company hasn't said much about its investigation. But others have unearthed new leads that may point to the perpetrators. \n \n This photo shows Dyn, a New Hampshire internet service company, in the old mill section of the city, on Oct. 21, in Manchester, New Hampshire. Image: AP Photo/Jim Cole \n \n Of course, the attack was so massive that the results of the investigation may not help prevent another attack. Sure, you can reenforce your windows and put a bolt on the door, but what good will that do against an innumerable number of invaders? \n \n The attack that jammed the internet \n \n Friday's DDoS attack on Dyn came in three waves that left the internet reeling. \n \n Dyn allows internet users to access a range of hugely popular sites such as Twitter and Spotify, and the attack on Dyn left major websites dealing with outages and extreme slowness. \n \n A distributed denial of service attack is when an onslaught of web traffic overwhelms a server so everyday users are unable to access it. \n \n \"The nature and source of the attack is under investigation, but it was a sophisticated attack across multiple attack vectors and internet locations,\" Kyle York, Dyn\u2019s chief strategy officer, wrote in a company blog post on Saturday. \n \n Hackers essentially weaponized video cameras to send unmanageable amounts of traffic to Dyn's servers, causing much of the Internet to slow to a crawl. Image: Dominic Lipinski/PA Wire \n \n The investigation points to attention seeking hackers \n \n Adam Coughlin, Dyn's director of corporate communications, told Mashable the company \"should\" have completed a \"root cause analysis\" by mid-week. \n \n \"At this point we know this was a sophisticated, highly distributed attack involving 10s of millions of IP addresses,\" York wrote in a blog post. \n \n But while Dyn isn't revealing many details, the cybersecurity firm Flashpoint released more information on Tuesday about who might be behind the attack. \n \n Flashpoint, a company that has provided analysis to Dyn, found that the hacker or group of hackers who attacked the site on Friday also targeted a video game company. \n \n \"We look at a lot of different DDoS attacks that happen, and political actors don't attack video game companies, generally,\" Allison Nixon, Flashpoint's director of security research at Fl Security Research, told Mashable. \n \n Researchers also doubt the hack was intended for financial gain, since hacks for money usually target Bitcoin exchanges or gambling sites. \n \n \"They're trying to show how powerful they are, and how else do you show how powerful you are than taking down someone that's powerful.\" \n \n Instead, early signs point to a hacker or a group of hackers who just wanted to show off. \"They're trying to show how powerful they are, and how else do you show how powerful you are than taking down someone that's powerful,\" Nixon said. \n \n According to Tuesday's report, Flashpoint believes they're \"likely connected to the English-language hacking forum community, specifically users and readers of the forum hackforums.net.\" \n \n The attacker used a type of malware called Mirai, which hacks poorly protected devices and uses them to hurl junk data at whatever the attacker wants. \n \n A hacker who goes by the handle Anna-Senpai released the Mirai source code earlier this month on hackforums.net, making it accessible to anyone. This means it is more difficult to track down the person who directed the operation, as any hacker could have put the code to work. \n \n The attack was similar to recent DDoS attacks against the security blog Krebs on Security as well as OVH, a French \"internet service hosting provider.\" Flashpoint has said similar types of attacks often originate from users of hackforums.net. \n \n Friday's attack, though similar, involved devices that were \"separate and distinct\" from the devices used in the other digital assaults. \n \n The malware used in last week's DDoS attack hijacked digital video recorders as well as cameras. Image: Soeren Stache/picture-alliance/dpa/AP Images \n \n The investigation only matters up to a point \n \n The size of the attack leveled at Dyn makes it unclear how useful the company's post-mortem will be, because it likely can't bolster its cyber defense quickly enough to prevent such a massive assault. \n \n Friday's attacker hijacked millions of \"Internet of Things\" (IoT) devices such as DVRs and video recorders, and had those devices flood Dyn with data. Dyn doesn't control those cameras, and experts said many of those devices can't be patched, meaning someone can simply hack them again and again to launch new assaults. \n \n \"This is the internet of largely un-patchable things,\" Joshua Corman, the director of The Atlantic Council's Cyber Statecraft Initiative, told Mashable. \"Unless you take them out of service, these [devices] can be repeat offenders for the life of the internet.\" \n \n A surveillance camera outside the Landtag state parliament in Potsdam, Germany. Image: Ralf Hirschberger/picture-alliance/dpa/AP Images \n \n Even if companies get better at mitigating large DDoS attacks, it will be difficult to scale at the rate at which the number of hackable devices increases. According to Intel, by 2020 there will be 200 billion objects connected to the internet. That's up from 2 billion in 2006. \n \n Due to the sheer number of devices, the attackers have a significant advantage. The more devices they can use in the attack, the more powerful the attack will be. \n \n In the coming days and weeks, investigators will no doubt explore how they were exploited, how the attack was carried out and the effectiveness of their response to the attack. Cybersecurity experts said Dyn will likely want to take stock of what vulnerabilities could be strengthened in case the company again falls victim. \n \n Can major DDoS attacks be stopped? \n \n CCTV cameras were among the devices hacked in last week's DDoS attack on Dyn. Image: Clive Gee/PA Wire \n \n These kind of attacks are likely to continue as long as millions of IoT devices remain hackable. \n \n Companies might be able to do a few things to mitigate the damage, but they can't stop manufacturers from making hackable devices, and they can't singlehandedly educate the public about enhancing the security of every device hooked up to the IoT. \n \n \"I'm not saying every user should be a security expert and figure out how to reconfigure their toaster or whatever,\" Zach Lanier, director of research at Cylance, a cybersecurity firm, told Mashable. \"But there are some basic practices that users can do to make sure their IoT devices aren't accessible.\" \n \n Krebs on Security suggests resetting IoT devices such as wireless routers and IP cameras to their factory settings, which is often just a matter of finding a reset button on the device. This wipes out any malware already on the device. \n \n But it could be reinfected in minutes, so you'll need to quickly reset the device's default password. \n \n Googling the device's make and model should turn up a web address and a factory default username-password combo. Typing that into a web browser should take you to the device's \"administration panel,\" where you can reset the password, Krebs on Security reported. \n \n Until many IoT device owners get on top of security, we should all expect some more slow days on the internet. ||||| Researchers at Flashpoint pointed a finger of blame at \u201cscript kiddies\u201d for the huge IoT-based DDoS attack that made parts of the internet inaccessible last Friday. In fact, the primary target may have been a \u201ca well-known video game company\u201d that happened to use Dyn for DNS services. \n \n The researchers wrote: \n \n Flashpoint assesses with moderate confidence that the most recent Mirai attacks are likely connected to the English-language hacking forum community, specifically users and readers of the forum \u201chackforums[.]net.\u201d \n \n Flashpoint explained: \n \n The infrastructure used in the attack also targeted a well-known video game company. While there does not appear to have been any disruption of service, the targeting of a video game company is less indicative of hacktivists, state-actors, or social justice communities, and aligns more with the hackers that frequent online hacking forums. These hackers exist in their own tier, sometimes called \u201cscript kiddies,\u201d and are separate and distinct from hacktivists, organized crime, state-actors, and terrorist groups. They can be motivated by financial gain, but just as often will execute attacks such as these to show off, or to cause disruption and chaos for sport. \n \n Although Flashpoint never named which specific video game company, it seems like the PlayStation Network may have been the real target. \n \n As Network World's Time Greene pointed out, there is a post on hackforums[.]net which reads: \u201cthis is funny, only because they didnt actually attk DYN fun fact DYN was never intentionally attkd until later that day PSN was the target (bf1 release) they used DYN's ns: ns00.playstation.net, ns01.playstation.net, ns02.playstation.net etc.\u201d \n \n Flashpoint does not believe there was any political motivation behind the attacks. Allison Nixon, director of researcher at Flashpoint, shot down theories that The Jester, WikiLeaks or New World Hackers were responsible for the attacks, calling their claims of responsibility \u201cdubious.\u201d \n \n Nixon added, \u201cAll the arrows point away from any sort of political motivation,\u201d which hurts \u201cthe nation-state argument. Of course, you never know until someone\u2019s got handcuffs on them.\u201d \n \n At the Council on Foreign Relations on Tuesday, National Intelligence Director James Clapper said he also believes a \u201cnon-state actor\u201d was behind the attack. Not that everything Clapper says can be considered entirely truthful. \n \n So far, Dyn has refused to speculate regarding motivation or the identity of the attackers. However, Dyn has said its analysis indicated the Mirai botnet was the primary source of \u201cmaliciously targeted, masked TCP and UDP traffic over port 53.\u201d \n \n Senator wants ISPs to ban insecure IoT devices from their networks \n \n Senator Mark Warner, a co-chair of the Senate Cybersecurity Caucus, has grown increasingly concerned about the flood of insecure IoT devices; the massive DDoS attack on Dyn DNS, which took down large chunks of the internet on October 21, seems to have been the last straw. \n \n On Tuesday, Warner sent a letter to the FCC, FTC and DHS, pointing out that \u201cmanufacturers today are flooding the market with cheap, insecure devices, with few market incentives to design the product with security in mind, or to provide ongoing support.\u201d And the effectiveness of Mirai depends, \u201cin large part, on the unacceptably low level of security inherent in a vast array of network devices.\u201d \n \n He added, \u201cBecause the producers of these insecure IoT devices currently are insulated from any standards requirements, market feedback, or liability concerns, I am deeply concerned that we are witnessing a \u2018tragedy of the commons\u2019 threat to the continued functioning of the internet, as the security so vital to all internet users remains the responsibility of none.\u201d \n \n Although \u201cISPs cannot prohibit the attachment of \u2018non-harmful devices\u2019 to their network,\u201d after the release of Mirai source code and the crippling attack on Dyn DNS, Warner believes it is \u201centirely reasonable\u201d for \u201cdevices with certain insecure attributes\u201d to be \u201cdeemed harmful to the \u2018network\u2019.\u201d In addition to wanting to know if ISPs can block \u201cinsecure\u201d IoT devices from connecting to their networks, Warner asked for answers to another eight questions. \n \n Dyn amends number of Mirai-controlled IoT devices used in DDoS attacks \n \n Dyn had previously suggested there had been tens of millions of infected IoT devices used in the Oct. 21 attacks. Today, Dyn said:",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The distributed denial of service attack that sent Internet users into a tailspin Friday was the most powerful of its kind by far, say cybersecurity researchers, and they're especially alarmed because it looks to be the work of amateur hackers. Twitter, Netflix, Reddit, and other sites went down as the Mirai botnet took over poorly protected \"Internet of things\" devices like DVRs and webcams\u2014whose owners hadn't changed the devices' default passwords\u2014and bombarded domain host company Dyn with traffic so regular users couldn't get through. Apparently there were a lot of insecure devices out there to use. Dyn says there were \"100,000 malicious endpoints\" leading an attack twice as powerful as any other DDoS attack reported, per the Guardian. Researchers from cybersecurity firm Flashpoint suspect the attack was tied to the community at Hackforums.net\u2014where the Mirai source code was published earlier this month, per Mashable\u2014and was meant to target a video game company, perhaps the PlayStation Network, reports Computer World. If amateur hackers did so much damage, \"imagine what a well-resourced state actor could do with insecure IoT devices,\" says a cybersecurity rep at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"We have a serious problem with the cyber insecurity of IoT devices and no real strategy to combat it.\" Experts recommend users reset an IoT device to its factory settings to erase any existing malware, then create a new password immediately.",

He was joined by his wife, Heidi; his mother, Eleanor Darragh, who is seldom seen on the campaign trail; and Carly Fiorina, a high-profile supporter. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n For much of the event, Mr. Cruz sat quietly behind a modest floral arrangement, allowing the women to speak on his behalf during a forum that seemed aimed at a rival whose name was scarcely mentioned. \n \n \u201cI just wanted to say one thing about Ted,\u201d Heidi Cruz said near the end. \u201cI want all of the women here in Wisconsin and across this country to know how supportive Ted has always been of all the women in his life.\u201d ||||| Donald Trump yanked the Republican Party toward a contested convention over the past 24 hours as he let rip an extraordinary series of statements on abortion, the Geneva Conventions, violence against women and his own commitment to supporting the GOP presidential nominee that seemed to obliterate the notion that the party will unite behind him anytime soon. \n \n The fallout for Trump has been swift, as Republican rivals denounced the real estate mogul\u2019s escalating attacks on a reporter who accused Trump\u2019s campaign manager of battery and his suggestion that women should be punished for seeking abortions if the procedure is outlawed \u2014 a statement Trump quickly tried to walk back. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n He also freshly rankled leading Republicans around the country for tearing up his previous pledge to support the eventual nominee, saying Tuesday night that \u201cwe\u2019ll see who it is.\u201d \n \n The series of events gave mainstream Republicans new hope that they could prevent him from winning the nomination outright through pledged delegates. But they're also more worried than ever about a fractured party heading into the fall. \n \n \u201cTrump is an embarrassment for the party. He\u2019s not a conservative, he\u2019s not a Republican, he\u2019s someone who\u2019s simply for himself,\u201d said Ryan Williams, a GOP consultant and veteran of Mitt Romney\u2019s campaigns. \u201cHe\u2019s set a new standard and is going to give a number of Republicans pause about supporting him if he\u2019s the nominee. That\u2019s Donald Trump\u2019s fault and Donald Trump\u2019s fault alone.\u201d \n \n Trump created yet another firestorm on Wednesday afternoon, when he lamented the existence of the Geneva Conventions. \u201cThe problem is we have the Geneva Conventions, all sorts of rules and regulations, so the soldiers are afraid to fight,\u201d Trump said at an afternoon town hall. \n \n But it was his comments regarding women \u2014 both his suggestion about criminalizing abortion and his escalating attacks on Breitbart journalist Michelle Fields \u2014 that set off the loudest alarm bells. \n \n In a sign of how damaging his comments on abortion were, Trump swiftly reversed himself. The controversy started when MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews pressed Trump on his statement that abortion \u201cis a very serious problem, and it\u2019s a problem we have to decide on. Are you going to send them to jail?\u201d \n \n After Matthews tried to draw him out on what should happen if abortions are outlawed, Trump responded, \u201cThere has to be some form of punishment.\u201d \n \n Bipartisan criticism was immediate, with Hillary Clinton calling the comment \u201chorrific and telling\u201d and Republican rival John Kasich strongly disputing Trump's assertion: \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d \n \n The Trump campaign went into damage control mode, emailing out a clarifying statement. \u201cIf Congress were to pass legislation making abortion illegal and the federal courts upheld this legislation, or any state were permitted to ban abortion under state and federal law, the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman,\u201d Trump said in the statement. \u201cThe woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb. My position has not changed \u2014 like Ronald Reagan, I am pro-life with exceptions.\u201d \n \n The statement on abortion compounded his inflammatory comments about Fields, the former reporter who accused Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, of roughly yanking her arm as she tried to ask Trump a question earlier this month. Lewandowski was charged with misdemeanor battery on Tuesday. \n \n On Wednesday, Trump stoked the controversy by accusing Fields of provoking Lewandowski in the incident and brandishing a pen as she tried to talk to him. \n \n \u201cFox & Friends\u201d co-host Brian Kilmeade challenged Trump on his account of the incident Wednesday morning, saying that campaign managers like Lewandowski \"should not be putting their hands on reporters.\" He added, \"Karl Rove didn\u2019t do it. David Plouffe didn\u2019t do it, David Axelrod didn\u2019t do it. That\u2019s why you have Secret Service, and that\u2019s why you have your own security.\u201d \n \n Trump shot back, speculating that perhaps the three campaign managers had. \u201cOK, and you don\u2019t know that they didn\u2019t do it, because I guarantee you they did, probably did stuff that was more physical than this,\" he said. \"More physical, because this is not even physical. And frankly, she shouldn\u2019t have her hands on me. Nobody says that. But she shouldn\u2019t have her hands on me.\u201d \n \n While Trump has become a master at firing off controversial comments and earning kudos from his core supporters for his disregard for political correctness, the real estate mogul is making little headway in his recently stated goal of convincing the Republican Party to unify behind him as the front-runner. \n \n Trump has a large lead over rival Ted Cruz in the delegate race, 736 to the Texas senator\u2019s 463, but it\u2019s not clear whether he\u2019ll be able to secure the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination before the July convention. \n \n Poll numbers out Wednesday for Wisconsin\u2019s primary next week were not encouraging for the real estate mogul. The survey from Marquette Law School, the state\u2019s most reliable pollster, showed Cruz with a 10-point lead over Trump. \n \n And the front-runner is winning few converts among centrist Republicans. At one point earlier this year, some on Capitol Hill and among the lobbyist crowd on K Street entertained the idea that Trump would be preferable to Cruz. \n \n They had considered Trump someone with whom they could cut deals, and questioned whether he really believed the fiery rhetoric he employed on the stump. But his repudiation on Tuesday night of his promise to support the eventual GOP nominee \u2014 on top of a string of other controversial statements he's made over the past few weeks \u2014 made many Republicans deeply uncomfortable, making unity an even more unlikely prospect. \n \n \u201cAs head of the party, it is disturbing for anybody \u2014 not necessarily Trump \u2014 saying that they may or may not support our nominee,\u201d said Diana Waterman, chairwoman of the Maryland GOP. \u201cAt the end of it, we\u2019re supposed to all come together. That includes the people who were not successful in getting there.\u201d \n \n Another party chairman from a state with an upcoming primary, who requested anonymity to share reservations about Trump, said his theatrics take the party\u2019s focus off members' shared rejection of Clinton and Bernie Sanders. \n \n \u201cUnfortunately it seems that whenever Mr. Trump is worried he may not become the Republican nominee, he makes these sorts of comments,\u201d the chairman said. \u201cMy concern about his latest comments is that it will only make it harder for him to convince longtime loyal grass-roots Republicans of his sincerity and to persuade them to rally behind his candidacy. All of the Republican candidates must always first consider the best interest of this country and not hurt feelings.\u201d \n \n But there is also risk to Republican leaders in being openly hostile to Trump. In a contested convention scenario, there is no guarantee that Trump supporters would get in line behind another candidate should the real estate mogul fall short, particularly if they feel that he has been treated unfairly by the party \u2014 and Trump has already claimed mistreatment. \n \n \u201cHow things are conducted going forward matters, and I\u2019m really personally counting on our party leadership to set an example and come together,\u201d said Steve Munisteri, former chairman of the Republican Party of Texas. \n \n Munisteri said that if Trump ultimately wins the nomination, he would expect supporters of Cruz and Kasich to put aside their differences and back him, regardless of what the candidates themselves do. But, he acknowledged, Trump backers are less predictable and could set the stage for a deeply damaging moment for the Republican Party. \n \n There is also always the threat of a third-party bid, either from Trump himself if he doesn\u2019t clinch the GOP nomination, or from another candidate brought in as an alternative to Trump, though Republicans well-versed in party rules note that there is limited time, and ballot access constraints could keep that headache in check. \n \n But as the convention nears with Trump still leading the pack, despite his fiery statements, the Republican Party\u2019s soul-searching will become even more dire. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t envy my friends at the [Republican National Committee] right now,\u201d said Williams, the Romney veteran. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a difficult task for the RNC to try to bring the party together.\u201d \n \n Nolan D. McCaskill, Ben Schreckinger and Eliza Collins contributed to this report. ||||| Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump stirred up controversy when he said there should be \"some sort of punishment\" for women who have abortions. Here's a look back at how he \"evolved\" into his pro-life views. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) \n \n \u201cI\u2019m pro-life, and I was originally pro-choice. I will say this, that as a developer and as a businessman I\u2019m not sure I was ever even asked the question, \u2018Are you pro-life, pro-choice?\u2019 \u2026 I have evolved. I talk about evolving all the time. And by the way, you know who else evolved? Ronald Reagan evolved. Because Ronald Reagan signed one of the toughest abortion laws in favor of abortion in California that had been signed in many, many years. \u2026 He wasn\u2019t very conservative [passing the law as governor], but he was a pretty conservative president.\u201d \n \n \u2014 Donald Trump, CNN town hall, March 29, 2016 \n \n There is growing attention on Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric on gender and women, which his critics view as misogynistic or often reduced to superficial comments about appearances (recent example: Trump\u2019s comments about Ted Cruz\u2019s wife). Ahead of the April 5 Wisconsin primary, Trump is facing more questions about his policy views on gender and women\u2019s issues \u2014 particularly, his views on abortion. \n \n Trump often compares his self-described evolution from being a Democrat to Republican to Ronald Reagan, who was once a Democrat before becoming the Republican icon. And now, he suggests that his evolution from supporting abortion rights to vocally opposing it is like Reagan\u2019s, who once passed a law in favor of women\u2019s access to abortion. \n \n Reagan did sign a law in 1967 that liberalized abortions \u2014 six years before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on Roe v. Wade. But this was long before abortion was a national social policy matter, before there were such terms like \u201cpro-choice\u201d and \u201cpro-life.\u201d The circumstances were a lot different then. Reagan did evolve on his abortion views, but it was less stark of a transition than Trump\u2019s. It\u2019s time for a history lesson for the Republican front-runner. \n \n The Facts \n \n In 1999, Trump publicly said he was a supporter of abortion rights as a matter of women\u2019s choice. In an interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Trump was asked whether he would ban abortions, or at least \u201cpartial-birth\u201d abortions. He said he would not, and that he is \u201cpro-choice in every respect.\u201d (Note: This shows he was indeed asked the question, despite his statement to CNN that \u201cas a businessman I\u2019m not sure I was ever even asked the question.\u201d) \n \n \u201cI\u2019m very pro-choice,\u201d Trump told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cI hate the concept of abortion. \u2026 But still, I just believe in choice.\u201d \n \n But now on the presidential campaign trail in 2016, Trump is a vocal opponent of women\u2019s rights to abortion \u2014 even to the point of saying that women who receive illegal abortions should be subject to \u201csome sort of punishment.\u201d Trump explains that he hadn\u2019t given it much thought from a policy perspective when he was a businessman. And now that he is a presidential candidate, he says he is decidedly antiabortion. \n \n How similar is that to Ronald Reagan\u2019s evolution? \n \n In June 1967, six months after becoming the Republican governor of California, Reagan signed a bill into law that he later would call \u201cmy worst decision as governor.\u201d \n \n It was the California Therapeutic Abortion Act, which aimed to make California the third state in the nation to liberalize abortion laws. Having an abortion was a crime in every state, and doctors were performing thousands of illegal abortions in the state every year (and some women were going to Mexico to get illegal abortions). \n \n There was no \u201cpro-choice\u201d or \u201cpro-life\u201d lobbying at the time. The battle lines were drawn along religious lines, according to Reagan biographer and former Washington Post reporter Lou Cannon. In 1967, the majority of Californians, including 67 percent of Catholics, had supported liberalizing abortion laws. (California at the time permitted abortions only to save the life of the mother.) \n \n Catholic Democrats generally were antiabortion, but liberal Democrats pushed for a permissive version of a law to provide women broad access to abortions. Conservatives who were not Catholics, generally Protestants, supported the proposed law, believing the government should stay out of \u201cthe boardroom and the bedroom,\u201d Cannon wrote in \u201cGovernor Reagan: His Rise to Power.\u201d \n \n Yet Republican lawmakers wanted to stop a broad-ranging version of the bill from progressing, and pushed for a less permissive version. Some Republicans also believed that if Reagan didn\u2019t sign some sort of abortion bill into law in 1967, the issue would come back every year \u2014 or that the legislature would override his veto. \n \n Reagan was torn. He had not given abortion much thought and had no strong opinion prior to taking office \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a leading social issue at the time \u2014 but he was faced with a decision that could set the tone for the rest of the country. Not helping with Reagan\u2019s indecision, his staff were split along religious lines on the issue and had no clear consensus on which direction the governor should go. For instance, his legal affairs secretary, Edwin Meese, urged Reagan to sign the bill. \n \n \u201cI did more studying and soul searching on this matter than on anything that was to face me as governor,\u201d Reagan later said in a radio address detailing his struggle contemplating the law. \n \n \u201cMy answer as to what kind of abortion bill I could sign was one that recognized an abortion is the taking of a human life. \u2026 Therefore, an abortion is justified when done in self-defense. My belief is that a woman has the right to protect her own life and health against even her own unborn child. I believe also that just as she has the right to defend herself against rape, she should not be made to bear a child resulting from the violation of her person and therefore abortion is an act of self-defense. I know there will be disagreements with this view, but I can find no evidence whatsoever that a fetus is not a living human being with human rights.\u201d \n \n Reagan reluctantly signed a compromise bill, and said the measure did not fully satisfy him. California became the third and largest state to legalize abortions in cases of rape, incest or when the pregnancy \u201cwould gravely impair physical or mental health\u201d of the mother. \n \n Then, abortions increased exponentially, as doctors took a loose interpretation of the \u201cmental health\u201d provision. Annual abortions spiked, and Reagan regretted his decision once he saw how the law was being implemented. Even Democrats were surprised at how doctors interpreted this \u201cmental health\u201d exception. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s the only major thing that he ever did as governor or president, that I\u2019m aware of or that I can recall, that he ever said he did the wrong thing,\u201d Cannon recalled to The Fact Checker. Reagan later ran for president on an antiabortion platform. \n \n As readers can see, it clearly was a different point in history. By the time the Supreme Court considered Roe v. Wade in 1973, legalizing abortion nationally, almost half the states had followed the decisions of states like California to open up abortion laws with exceptions. Back then, even supporters of abortion rights were skeptical of Roe v. Wade decision or opposed it. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal icon, has even criticized it for empowering the antiabortion movement, and cutting off a gradual move among states to legalize abortion along with courts and state legislatures. \n \n The Pinocchio Test \n \n In a rare instance, the Republican front-runner is not glaringly incorrect. He accurately cites a controversial decision by Reagan that allowed abortion in California in cases of rape, incest and physical and mental health of the mother \u2014 one of the first states to do so. Reagan was torn on the decision; he believed the fetus was a \u201cliving human being with human rights,\u201d but was presented with evidence of thousands of women in his state already seeking abortions illegally. Reagan\u2019s view of allowing abortions in cases of rape, incest or life of the mother is actually consistent with what many people with \u201cpro-life\u201d views believe. \n \n Reagan signing the law was not necessarily a reflection of his support for women\u2019s right to choice, as it was long before the terms \u201cpro-choice\u201d and \u201cpro-life\u201d existed. Rather, his decision resulted from a confluence of a grass-roots movement among women and doctors, political maneuvering from legislators in the State Assembly, and his own lack of direction on exactly how he stood on the matter. Looking back now, it is clear Reagan had \u201cpro-life\u201d tendencies, as we now use the term. \n \n We take issue with the historical comparison Trump makes. His evolution is not analogous with Reagan\u2019s, when considering the historical context. Trump said he was \u201cvery pro-choice,\u201d and now he identifies as \u201cpro-life.\u201d But he is identifying with such labels after the battle lines in the abortion debate long had been drawn. In contrast, Reagan\u2019s evolution took place when he deliberated whether to legalize abortions for specific circumstances that he believed were appropriate: rape, incest and physical and mental health of the mother. When the last provision was interpreted far beyond what he had intended, he regretted his decision and became even more strongly antiabortion. \n \n Politicians obviously have the right to change their views on key issues. But Trump\u2019s suggestion that he has \u201cevolved\u201d just like Reagan suggests he does not really know the history of Reagan\u2019s decision-making on the law. Trump should drop the comparison; it\u2019s a gratuitous one that lacks historical context, and not analogous to his own evolution. \n \n Two Pinocchios \n \n \n \n \n \n (About our rating scale) \n \n 1 of 45 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 What Donald Trump is doing on the campaign trail View Photos Businessman Donald Trump officially became the Republican nominee at the party\u2019s convention in Cleveland.

Wade, he also opposes exceptions for rape and incest. Lots of viewers probably saw that and said, \u201cWow, that\u2019s a pretty radical position to take.\u201d And it is. But they may not realize just how radical the entire field of Republican presidential candidates is on the issue of abortion. \n \n I\u2019ll be getting to exactly where the GOP candidates stand in a moment. Because public opinion on abortion has been relatively stable for decades now, because the two parties take clear and opposing positions on the issue, and because certain kinds of vague poll questions show a near-even split among Americans, reporters often assume that the public is evenly divided on the issue and therefore it will always be a wash when election time comes around. But that\u2019s not actually true. \n \n To understand why, you have to separate what Americans say when asked these questions in different ways, what they say when they\u2019re asked specific questions as opposed to general questions, and where each of the Republicans actually stand. \n \n The poll questions that produce roughly equal divisions come in two forms. The first asks whether respondents generally consider themselves \u201cpro-life\u201d or \u201cpro-choice.\u201d While at times one or the other has moved into the majority, those two options have stayed close in popularity for the last 15 years. The second form asks whether abortions should always be legal, always be illegal, legal under most circumstances, or legal under only some circumstances. In that case, you tend to get slightly over 50 percent saying always or mostly legal, and around 40-45 percent saying always or mostly illegal (the latest Pew data show a 55-40 division on this question; see here for trends on both questions). \n \n Politicians don\u2019t have the luxury of just saying \u201cI\u2019m pro-life\u201d or \u201cI think abortion should be legal in most circumstances.\u201d They have to tell us exactly what they\u2019d do. And what the Republican candidates would do is not just unpopular, but unpopular even within their own party. \n \n I\u2019m going to focus on two questions for the moment: whether Roe v. Wade should be overturned, and whether, if abortion is banned, there ought to be exceptions for victims of rape and incest. \n \n The Roe v. Wade question is critical, because it is all but guaranteed that should a Republican become president, he will appoint only Supreme Court justices who can be counted on to vote to overturn Roe, which would allow states to ban abortion completely. Right now there are four Supreme Court justices ready to overturn the decision; if the right justice (or two) retires, it would be gone. \n \n But that\u2019s not what the public wants. Polls consistently show that between 55 and 65 percent of Americans say that Roe should not be overturned, while only around 30 percent say it should. And even within the Republican Party opinion is divided almost evenly. Yet with the exception of George Pataki, every single Republican candidate for president is in favor of overturning Roe v. Wade (if we assume that Donald Trump\u2019s relatively recent conversion to the pro-life cause includes opposition to Roe; he doesn\u2019t seem to have said specifically, but when asked, he insists that he\u2019s pro-life and hates abortion). \n \n On the question of exceptions to abortion bans in cases of rape or incest, I should note that opposing such exceptions is philosophically consistent. If you believe that abortion is murder, then you ought to believe it\u2019s always murder, however the woman got pregnant. You could also argue that rape and incest exceptions reinforce the idea that abortion access ought to be granted through some kind of puritanical virtue test \u2014 a woman who was raped didn\u2019t willfully have sex, so therefore she isn\u2019t a dirty sinner and she can get an abortion. \n \n Nevertheless, the fact is that most Americans believe women who are raped or girls who are the victims of incest should be able to access abortion. And not just a majority, but a huge majority. Polls that have asked this question find between 75 and 85 percent favoring legal abortions in case of rape and incest (see here for some of them). \n \n So here\u2019s where the GOP candidates stand on that question: \n \n Donald Trump: Supports exceptions for rape and incest. \n \n Supports exceptions for rape and incest. Ben Carson: Opposes exceptions for rape and incest. \n \n Opposes exceptions for rape and incest. Jeb Bush: Supports exceptions for rape and incest. \n \n Supports exceptions for rape and incest. Marco Rubio: Opposes exceptions for rape and incest. \n \n Opposes exceptions for rape and incest. Ted Cruz: Opposes exceptions for rape and incest. \n \n Opposes exceptions for rape and incest. John Kasich: Supports he favors exceptions for rape and incest. \n \n Supports he favors exceptions for rape and incest. Carly Fiorina: Supports exceptions for rape and incest. \n \n Supports exceptions for rape and incest. Rand Paul: Proposed a constitutional amendment applying the 14th Amendment at the moment of conception, which would outlaw all abortions, including those resulting from rape and incest. \n \n Proposed a constitutional amendment applying the 14th Amendment at the moment of conception, which would outlaw all abortions, including those resulting from rape and incest.

Jim Gilmore: Unclear. \n \n Unclear. George Pataki: Supports keeping Roe v. Wade; would presumably support rape and incest exceptions, though I was unable to find any references to him addressing them specifically. \n \n For good measure, the departed Scott Walker also opposed exceptions for rape and incest. That leaves us with this: 14 of the 15 remaining Republican candidates want to overturn Roe v.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Donald Trump entered the national abortion debate on Wednesday as smoothly as a burning oil tanker slamming into a fireworks warehouse. After causing an outcry by saying that if abortions are banned, women who have them should be punished, he went on to claim the issue was \"unclear\" before issuing a statement saying that doctors, not women who have abortions, would be the ones to be punished if abortion was outlawed. \"My position has not changed\u2014like Ronald Reagan, I am pro-life with exceptions,\" he insisted. A roundup of reactions: The statements came amid what Politico calls \"24 hours of mayhem\" for Trump that also included scrapping his GOP loyalty pledge, a fresh line of attack in the Corey Lewandowski case, and complaining about the Geneva Conventions. Politico predicts that with the party now hopelessly divided, a contested GOP convention is almost inevitable. Ben Carson offered a very Carsonesque defense of Trump in a CNN interview. \"I don't think he really had a chance to really think about it,\" Carson said, adding that Trump was able to \"come up with a more rational and informed type of answer\" after talking to advisers. Carson said he agreed with Trump's latter position that abortion providers, not women, should be the ones to be punished if the US ever bans abortion. Ted Cruz didn't pass up the opportunity to slam Trump, the Hill reports. Trump \"has demonstrated that he hasn't seriously thought through the issues, and he'll say anything just to get attention,\" Cruz said in a statement. \"We shouldn't be talking about punishing women; we should affirm their dignity and the incredible gift they have to bring life into the world,\" added Cruz, who, unlike Trump, does not support exceptions for rape and incest under an abortion ban, according to the Washington Post. Some anti-abortion activists are just as outraged as pro-choice groups by Trump's earlier comments, the New York Times reports. They say the call to punish women shows that Trump's shift toward being anti-abortion is very recent\u2014and insincere. \"No pro-lifer would ever want to punish a woman who has chosen abortion,\" says the president of the March for Life Education and Defense Fund. \"We invite a woman who has gone down this route to consider paths to healing, not punishment.\" The Washington Post fact-checks Trump's claim that his change of position mirrors Reagan's, finding that this time, Trump is not \"glaringly incorrect,\" although the comparison is a \"gratuitous one that lacks historical context, and not analogous to his own evolution.\" The Post gives him two Pinocchios on a scale that goes to four.",

    "document": "TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) \u2014 The parents of a Texas woman who said she was raped while attending the University of Alabama have sued the alleged attacker, school officials and others, claiming the episode led to her suicide last year. \n \n A federal wrongful death lawsuit filed over the weekend by Michael and Cynthia Rondini of Austin, Texas, claims the alleged assault and officials' subsequent mishandling of the allegations prompted Megan Rondini to kill herself. \n \n The lawsuit says Rondini, then a 20-year-old junior who planned to go to medical school, met a man at a popular Tuscaloosa bar in July 2015. She was later sexually assaulted at his home, possibly after being drugged, the suit contends. \n \n Police investigating the sexual assault were sympathetic toward the man and wrongly focused on Rondini's actions, which including taking a handgun and $3 for cab fare from his home, the lawsuit claims. \n \n \"Megan ultimately was treated as a crime suspect and her status as a victim of a sex crime was completely disregarded,\" the suit said. The young woman withdrew from Alabama and returned home to Texas, where her mental condition deteriorated, according to the complaint. \n \n The man wasn't charged, and the lawsuit claims investigators and university officials mishandled her allegations. The suit contends Rondini afterward suffered depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, which her parents say led to her suicide. \n \n The lawsuit names the man, but The Associated Press is not using his name since he was not charged with a crime. It also names Beth Howard, Title IX coordinator at Alabama; Cara Blake of the school's Women and Gender Resource Center; Tuscaloosa County Sheriff Ron Abernathy; and two county officers, investigator Adam Jones and deputy Joshua Hastings. \n \n In a statement, the university declined comment on specifics of the lawsuit but said school officials were \"deeply saddened\" by Rondini's death and are trying to raise community awareness and support victims of sexual assault. \n \n A lawyer for the man named in the lawsuit denied that he had sexually assaulted her. \n \n \"The allegations against my client as set forth in this baseless lawsuit are simply false,\" the statement said. \n \n Abernathy said the case was referred to a grand jury, which declined to issue an indictment. Letting grand jurors consider evidence rather than filing immediate charges is standard practice in cases with \"very conflicting statements,\" Abernathy said. \n \n The lawsuit was assigned to a federal magistrate judge Monday, but no hearing date was set. \n \n The complaint doesn't seek a specific amount of money. It asks for a court order requiring the sheriff's office to provide better training to officers and \"to provide safe conditions to citizens around criminal investigations.\" ||||| A lawsuit accuses law enforcement and university officials of failing to give Megan Rondini, the subject of a BuzzFeed News story, the help she needed after she reported being assaulted by a wealthy man in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. \n \n The parents of a young woman who killed herself after alleging she\u2019d been raped by a wealthy Alabama man have sued the accused attacker, law enforcement officers, and a university Title IX official, alleging their \u201cfaulty practices\u201d and \u201cmishandling\u201d of the case drove their daughter to hang herself. The story of Megan Rondini, who was a student at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa when the alleged rape occurred, was detailed in a recent BuzzFeed News story. The 25-page wrongful death suit filed Sunday by Rondini\u2019s parents, Michael and Cynthia Rondini, charges that Tuscaloosa Sheriff's Department deputies were intentionally dismissive when Rondini reported in July 2015 that she was raped by T.J. Bunn, Jr., one of six defendants named in the suit. It accuses investigator Adam Jones and deputy Joshua Hastings of the Tuscaloosa Sheriff\u2019s Department of conducting sloppy investigations. Also named in the suit is Tuscaloosa Sheriff Ronald Abernathy, for allegedly failing to properly train his department in how to handle sexual assault reports. In addition, the Rondinis are suing Beth Howard, the University of Alabama\u2019s Title IX coordinator, who also held that position when their daughter reported she had been raped; and Cara Blakes, who was a graduate student working as a therapist at the school\u2019s Women and Gender Resource Center. All of the defendants \u201cnegligently, recklessly, wantonly, and/or wrongfully acted or failed to act in response to Megan\u2019s reported sexual assault,\u201d the lawsuit alleges. As a result, it says, Megan Rondini suffered \u201cextreme depression, anxiety, PTSD, fear, panic attacks, decline of cognitive functions and general well-being, weight loss, and feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness, all of which directly led to Megan\u2019s loss of life.\u201d \n \n W. Ivey Gilmore, Jr., an attorney for Bunn, said in a statement Monday that the accusations against his client in the suit are false. \"It is, perhaps, natural to want to find someone to blame when a young woman takes her life,\" Gilmore said. \"But accusing law enforcement and those who counseled this young woman for her actions is misguided. Unfortunately, bringing this matter before the courts in this civil action will only prolong grief without changing the reality.\" No one else named in the suit immediately responded to a request for comment. The suit, filed by Birmingham-based attorney Leroy Maxwell Jr., seeks an unspecified amount of damages. Megan Rondini\u2019s death came to light in the BuzzFeed News report, which used law enforcement interrogation videos, text messages, and other documentation to show her growing frustration after she told Tuscaloosa law enforcement that she\u2019d been raped after a night out with friends. Rondini accused T.J. Bunn Jr. in the assault, but Bunn said they had consensual sex. Tuscaloosa officers questioned why Rondini didn't kick or hit Bunn and concluded the incident did not meet Alabama\u2019s legal requirements for rape. They also questioned Rondini about crimes she had allegedly committed, including taking money and a gun from Bunn\u2019s car as she fled his home after the alleged assault. Rondini ultimately dropped the case, left the University of Alabama, and moved back to her native Texas, where she hanged herself in February 2016. Bunn was never charged with a crime. The article led to outrage in Congress. Last Wednesday, Rep. Ted Poe, a Republican from Texas, described Rondini's case and said \"she got the death penalty\u201d after reporting she\u2019d been sexually assaulted. Poe criticized Tuscaloosa investigators, saying they treated Rondini \u201cwith disdain and disbelief.\" \"It\u2019s easy to second guess what someone should or should not have done after emotional trauma of sexual assault, but Megan believes she did everything a rape victim is supposed to do,\" Poe said on the House floor. \n \n The lawsuit says Tuscaloosa officers failed to test Rondini's rape kit, failed to interview witnesses, and failed to record all of the interviews they did conduct. Their behavior \u201cwas intentional and due to Megan Rondini\u2019s female gender,\u201d the suit alleges. \n \n \u201cMegan ultimately was treated as a crime suspect and her status as a victim of a sex crime was completely disregarded,\u201d the lawsuit alleges. \"The only conclusive evidence gathered from the investigation was that Megan tested positive for a sexually transmitted disease that she contracted from non-consensual sex with Defendant Bunn,\" the suit states. Bunn's family is well-known in the Tuscaloosa area. His father and uncle own S.T. Bunn Construction, which took down its website following the BuzzFeed News story as people online directed outraged readers to their contact page. In a statement released shortly after the story appeared, Bunn's family called the article \"an intentional distortion of facts in a tragic case,\" and said Rondini's family had previously sought to sue \"various parties who are the targets of these unfounded accusations.\" \n \n \"It is tragic that this young woman took her own life, but defaming an entire city, its leaders, its institutions and a prominent family brings no honor to this tragedy and no justice for anyone,\" the Bunn family said in its statement. The University of Alabama has said the BuzzFeed News story \"ignored some significant facts,\" including that it gave Rondini information about services available to her on campus. It also noted that it referred Rondini to another counselor because the first one she met with after the alleged assault knew the Bunn family and recused herself from the case. However, the Rondini family claims in the lawsuit that the second counselor Rondini was referred to, Cara Blakes, \"inexplicably denied Megan counseling services\" until she began taking anti-anxiety medication. The lawsuit alleges this was a violation of Rondini's rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act. The suit also says that Beth Howard, the University of Alabama's Title IX coordinator, ignored calls and messages from Rondini's family requesting help for their daughter. The suit was filed in US District Court in Alabama. Anna Voremberg, a board member of End Rape on Campus, an advocacy group that has assisted Rondini's parents, accused investigators of appearing more sympathetic to Bunn in videotaped interviews than to Rondini, who was the one reporting a violent crime. \"Why would someone come forward to report any violence at all? It was just like a good ol' boys club in there,\" Voremberg told BuzzFeed News. \"Megan is just one example of many in which law enforcement officers truly fail survivors of sexual violence and their community.\" Katie J.M.

It claims the sheriff's office inadequately pursued the investigation and did not take Megan's claims seriously, and the university did not give her adequate psychological treatment and support after the alleged rape. \n \n Leroy Maxwell Jr., the Rondinis' attorney, said the lawsuit was filed with the hope that it would prevent cases similar to Megan's. \n \n \"There was a mediation with the Rondini family and the university, the details of which are confidential. The Rondini family is not in this for the money, they are only interested in shining a bright light on a tragic yet preventable situation,\" he said in a statement sent to AL.com. \"The court will determine if this case rises to the level of punitive damages.\" \n \n Meanwhile, the school, DCH Regional Medical Center, victim advocates, the Tuscaloosa District Attorney's office and law enforcement are establishing two sexual assault programs that care for sexual assault victims. \n \n \"While this long-term solution is being implemented, DCH is training its staff in the SANE [Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner] course curriculum,\" the groups said Friday in a joint press release. \n \n Terry Bunn Jr., Rondini's alleged rapist, could not immediately be reached for comment. The lawsuit identifies him as being part of a family that is \"well connected and powerful in the Tuscaloosa community, and were major financial supporters of UA.\" Bunn works at ST Bunn Construction Company, which is across the street from the Innisfree Pub, where Megan was allegedly drunk or drugged before being raped for 30 minutes in July 2015. \n \n His lawyer, W. Ivey Gillmore, said in a statement to AL.com that the lawsuit is \"baseless and \"simply false.\" \n \n \"Law enforcement investigated this matter; the district attorney's office reviewed the evidence; the evidence was even presented to a grand jury that found there was no justification for charges against my client. It is, perhaps, natural to want to find someone to blame when a young woman takes her life,\" Gillmore said. \"But accusing law enforcement and those who counseled this young woman for her actions is misguided. Unfortunately, bringing this matter before the courts in this civil action will only prolong grief without changing the reality.\" \n \n The filing goes on to claim that authorities sided with Bunn's version of events and did not thoroughly follow-up on Megan's story, and that an investigating officer was more interested in finding out whether Megan committed any crimes on the night of the rape. \n \n The university allegedly \"deliberately and repeatedly denied services and mishandled accommodations with hostility toward\" Megan, the suit goes on to say. The lawsuit claims Megan confided in a UA counselor who told her she could no longer give her therapy because she was a family friend of the Bunns, and that a second counselor would not see Megan unless she first took anxiety medication. \n \n The lawsuit claimed UA did not accommodate Megan after the rape, alleging that she saw Bunn's car outside her apartment and saw her alleged rapist on the Tuscaloosa campus. \n \n Prior to the lawsuit, the university had issued this statement: \n \n \"The University of Alabama has been deeply saddened by the death of Megan Rondini, and we continue to offer our sympathy to her friends and family. Information published by news outlets this week has unfortunately ignored some significant facts,\" UA said. \"When Megan went to the hospital, a university advocate met her at the hospital to provide support and stayed with her throughout the examination process. Megan also received information from university representatives regarding services available to her on campus, including counseling through the university's Women & Gender Resource Center. When she sought counseling and her first therapist identified a potential conflict as defined by her professional obligations, Megan was immediately introduced to another therapist, who provided care and support. Additionally, the UA Title IX Office was in contact with Megan, including offering academic accommodations and helping to streamline her withdrawal when Megan elected to return to Texas.\" \n \n Megan returned home to Austin, Texas, where the trauma from the rape and the response from law enforcement and the university caused her to kill herself, the lawsuit claims. \n \n \"The combined trauma due to Megan's treatment by the Tuscaloosa Sheriff's Department, the reporting process with UA, the additional anxiety of trying and failing to receive counseling as a result of her rape, and the influential position of her assailant in the community ultimately made Megan feel unsafe on campus and that she could no longer remain at UA,\" the lawsuit stated. \n \n Megan hung herself on February 26, 2016. Two days before, she sent a text that read: \"When all is said and done, I wonder what I could've accomplished if one man didn't completely rip everything away from me.\" \n \n A copy of the lawsuit is posted below: \n \n Rondini Lawsuit by hkoplowitz on Scribd \n \n Updated at 6:30 p.m. to include a statement from Bunn's attorney.",

It provides a look at the cultural touchstones that shape the lives of students entering college this fall. The creation of Beloit\u2019s Keefer Professor of the Humanities Tom McBride and former Public Affairs Director Ron Nief, it was originally created as a reminder to faculty to be aware of dated references, and quickly became a catalog of the rapidly changing worldview of each new generation. The Mindset List website at www.beloit.edu/mindset, the Mediasite webcast and its Facebook page receive more than 400,000 hits annually. \n \n The class of 2014 has never found Korean-made cars unusual on the Interstate and five hundred cable channels, of which they will watch a handful, have always been the norm. Since \"digital\" has always been in the cultural DNA, they've never written in cursive and with cell phones to tell them the time, there is no need for a wrist watch. Dirty Harry (who\u2019s that?) is to them a great Hollywood director. The America they have inherited is one of soaring American trade and budget deficits; Russia has presumably never aimed nukes at the United States and China has always posed an economic threat. \n \n Nonetheless, they plan to enjoy college. The males among them are likely to be a minority. They will be armed with iPhones and BlackBerries, on which making a phone call will be only one of many, many functions they will perform. They will now be awash with a computerized technology that will not distinguish information and knowledge. So it will be up to their professors to help them. A generation accustomed to instant access will need to acquire the patience of scholarship. They will discover how to research information in books and journals and not just on-line. Their professors, who might be tempted to think that they are hip enough and therefore ready and relevant to teach the new generation, might remember that Kurt Cobain is now on the classic oldies station. The college class of 2014 reminds us, once again, that a generation comes and goes in the blink of our eyes, which are, like the rest of us, getting older and older. \n \n Most students entering college for the first time this fall\u2014the Class of 2014\u2014were born in 1992. \n \n For these students, Benny Hill, Sam Kinison, Sam Walton, Bert Parks and Tony Perkins have always been dead. \n \n 1.

For instance, the peasant class, having no prospects for financial gain, glommed onto the virtue of humility, linked to the idea that God would reward them for their humility someday in Heaven. For the aristocratic class, whose financial prosperity was assured, courage became a dominant virtue.

Giving Bobbitt the money would be like \"giving him a loaded gun,\" since Bobbitt is addicted to drugs, D'Amico told the local newspaper. \n \n Bobbitt's attorneys have also filed an application for an injunctive relief require McClure and D'Amico to refrain from dissipating any of the monies donated to the GoFundMe account and from using the funds for any other purpose other than to directly benefit Bobbitt, according to court documents. \n \n Chris Fallon, one of the attorneys representing Bobbitt, did not immediately return ABC News' request for comment. \n \n An update McClure had written on the GoFundMe account indicated that the couple tried to ensure the safety of Bobbitt's financial future. Two trusts were to be set up in his name, one to provide him a small \"salary\" each year and a retirement trust and another which was to \"be wisely invested by a financial planner.\" \n \n ABC News \n \n A bank account had also been set up for Bobbitt with funds for his every day needs that was intended to \"get him through until he finds a job,\" and his one planned indulgence was to buy a 1999 Ford Ranger, the \"dream truck he's always wanted,\" and a home of his very own, McClure wrote. \n \n A formal trust for Bobbitt's benefit has not been created, according to the lawsuit. \n \n Bobbitt is seeking compensatory damages and interest, funds of counsel fees and costs of the lawsuit and accounting of all funds donated to the GoFundMe account. In addition, the lawsuit is requesting the appointment of a receiver for the funds and for the funds to be deposited with the court. \n \n McClure and D'Amico did not respond to ABC News' request for comment. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Bobbitt, who helped a stranded motorist in Philadelphia,... (Associated Press) \n \n MOUNT HOLLY, N.J. (AP) \u2014 A homeless man whose selfless act of using his last $20 to fill up the gas tank of a stranded motorist in Philadelphia got him worldwide attention is suing the couple who led a $400,000 fundraising campaign to help him. \n \n Johnny Bobbitt says he's concerned that Mark D'Amico and Katie McClure have mismanaged a large part of the donations raised for him on GoFundMe . The New Jersey couple denies the claims, saying they're wary of giving Bobbitt large sums because they feared he would buy drugs. \n \n Bobbitt's lawsuit contends the couple committed fraud by taking money from the fundraising campaign for themselves. He's seeking undisclosed damages, and his lawyers want a judge to appoint someone to oversee the account. \n \n A hearing on the lawsuit is scheduled for Thursday. \n \n McClure set up the online fundraiser page as a way to give back to Bobbitt, who came to her aid when she ran out of gas on an Interstate 95 exit ramp late one night. It raised more than $400,000 in funds donated by more than 14,000 people. \n \n Bobbitt walked a few blocks to buy McClure gas. She didn't have money to repay him at the time, but sought him out days later to give him the money, and visited him a few more times to bring food and water. They later appeared on shows like \"Good Morning America\" and were interviewed by the BBC. \n \n But the relationship has since gone sour. \n \n Christopher C. Fallon, one of Bobbitt's lawyers, told The Philadelphia Inquirer that the legal action was taken after D'Amico ignored multiple requests for a full accounting of the money raised by the GoFundMe campaign. \n \n \"He's really left us with no choice but to go forward,\" said Fallon, one of two pro bono lawyers from Cozen O'Connor in Philadelphia whom Bobbitt retained last week. \n \n McClure and D'Amico have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing or misusing any of the money. D'Amico has said Bobbitt spent $25,000 in less than two weeks in December on drugs, in addition to paying overdue legal bills and sending money to his family. \n \n The couple also bought Bobbitt a camper with some of the funds and parked it on land McClure's family owns in Florence. But Bobbitt became homeless again after D'Amico told him in June that he had to leave the property. \n \n During an appearance Monday on NBC's \"Megyn Kelly Today\" show, D'Amico told Kelly there was well over $150,000 left of the donations.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The Philadelphia couple who raised more than $400,000 for a homeless veteran are using the fund as their \"personal piggy bank,\" lawyers for Johnny Bobbitt Jr. write in a lawsuit filed Tuesday. Though lawyers say Bobbitt is staying at a hotel during a third stint in rehab, the 35-year-old Marine Corps veteran had been back to panhandling and battling a drug addiction on Philadelphia's streets despite a generous GoFundMe campaign organized by Kate McClure, 28, and Mark D'Amico, 39. They started the campaign after Bobbitt used his last $20 to buy gas for a stranded McClure and later bought a camper in which Bobbitt resided on property owned by McClure's family. Asked to leave in June because of drug use, per the Philadelphia Inquirer, Bobbitt alleges he's received just $75,000 of what he's due. McClure and D'Amico have interfered, spending more than half of the $402,000 raised \"to fund a lifestyle that they could not otherwise afford,\" the lawsuit claims, per ABC News. Bobbitt previously wondered at how McClure, a receptionist, could afford a new BMW. But the couple have said only $500 of the fund was improperly spent on gambling and repaid. Noting well over $150,000 remains but is being withheld from Bobbitt for fear he will spend it on drugs, the couple say they'll open the fund to review by an accountant, per the Inquirer. Too late, according to Bobbitt's lawyers, who say the lawsuit seeking a court-appointed overseer of the account came after D'Amico ignored repeated requests for a full accounting. \"He's really left us with no choice but to go forward,\" one tells the AP.

(Associated Press) \n \n German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrives to attend a UN Migration Conference in Marrakech, Morocco, Monday, Dec.10, 2018. Top U.N. officials and government leaders from about 150 countries are uniting around an agreement on migration, while finding themselves on the defensive about the non-binding deal... (Associated Press) \n \n MARRAKECH, Morocco (AP) \u2014 A United Nations accord, the \"Global Compact on Migration,\" adopted Monday by 164 U.N. members, but not the United States, aims to improve the treatment of migrants worldwide. \n \n Here, at a glance, are key points and details: \n \n WHAT IS IT? A non-binding, voluntary agreement that aims to ensure \"safe, orderly and regular migration.\" \n \n WHY? Because migration is such a huge economic, social, political and health issue, affecting nearly every country. The U.N.'s International Organization for Migration estimates there are 1 billion migrants worldwide, or nearly one in every seven humans. \n \n HOW WILL IT WORK? The pact encourages countries to work together, mentioning the word \"cooperation\" 62 times, and to fight discrimination against migrants. \n \n WHO SUPPORTS IT? German Chancellor Angela Merkel was a key backer. \n \n WHO OPPOSES IT? At least nine countries. In a detailed critique , the Trump administration said it could not \"support a 'compact' or process\" that could \"impose\" policy. It also said the agreement failed to \"distinguish adequately\" between legal and illegal immigrants. Many eastern European countries, and more recently Italy and Belgium, also voiced misgivings. \n \n WHAT DOES THE U.N. SAY? Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said: \"We are not establishing a new right to migrate. No. There is not a right for anyone to go anywhere at any time according to his or her whim. What we are establishing is the obligation to respect the human rights of migrants.\" \n \n The U.N. says more than 80 percent of the world's migrants move between countries \"in a safe and orderly fashion.\" And most migration is \"South-South\" \u2014 between countries in the southern hemisphere \u2014 not among people seeking to reach richer northern countries. ||||| German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrives to attend a UN Migration Conference in Marrakech, Morocco, Monday, Dec.10, 2018.

(Associated Press) \n \n MARRAKECH, Morocco (AP) \u2014 Defying fierce opposition from the United States and a few other nations, nearly 85 percent of the countries at the U.N. agreed Monday on a sweeping yet non-binding accord to ensure safe, orderly and humane migration. \n \n The debate over the Global Compact for Migration, the first of its kind, has proven to be a pivotal test of the U.N.-led effort to crack down on the often dangerous and illegal movements across borders that have turned people smuggling into a booming worldwide industry. \n \n \"Unregulated migration bears a terrible human cost: a cost in lives lost on perilous journeys across deserts, oceans and rivers; and a cost in lives ruined at the hands of smugglers, unscrupulous employers and other predators,\" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told a migration conference in Marrakech, Morocco. \n \n \"More than 60,000 migrants have died on the move since the year 2000,\" he said. \"This is a source of collective shame.\" \n \n Migration affects hundreds of millions of people across the globe \u2014 farmers coming off the land or forced by climate change to head to cities, families fleeing war or persecution at home, impoverished workers from the developing world looking for jobs in rich countries. It can also involve high-skilled workers from developed nations looking for opportunities beyond their homelands. \n \n Defenders say migration greases the wheels of the world economy by diversifying and rejuvenating workforce in aging rich countries and providing a needed source of cash to poorer countries through remittances sent home by migrants. \n \n Opponents often fear that an influx of migrants can dilute their countries' character, import poverty or crime, reduce wages and take jobs from tax-paying citizens. \n \n A total of 164 countries among the 193 U.N. members approved the agreement by acclamation Monday. \n \n At the two-day conference, U.N. leaders were hoping to lure in holdouts from mostly Western nations who were not signing: Australia, Austria, the Czech Republic, the Dominican Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Poland and Slovakia along with the United States, which under President Donald Trump did not participate in drafting the accord. \n \n Louise Arbour of Canada, a former U.N. human rights chief, said the issue also has been tied up in parliamentary debates in Belgium, Bulgaria, Estonia, Italy, Israel, Slovenia and Switzerland \u2014 although some of them did participate in creating the accord, which has since been ensnared by tough political headwinds. \n \n The conference is the capstone of efforts set in motion two years ago when all 193 U.N. member states, including the U.S. under President Barack Obama, adopted a declaration saying that no country can manage international migration on its own and agreed to work on a global compact. \n \n The Trump administration \u2014 which is demanding a wall on the Mexican border and has sent U.S. military troops to the border to block a migrant caravan moving toward the U.S. through Central America \u2014 pulled out of the accord a year ago. It claimed that parts of the compact clashed with \"U.S. immigration and refugee policies.\" \n \n Some European Union countries, including Italy, Poland and Hungary, now have anti-migrant populist governments that have reacted strongly after over 1 million migrants \u2014 mostly refugees fleeing conflict in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan \u2014 poured into Europe in 2015. \n \n Since then, right-wing and anti-immigration movements have enjoyed a surge in political support in pockets of Europe.",

The 87-year-old author alleges Pinkus took advantage of her declining hearing and eyesight seven years ago to get her to assign the book's copyright to him and a company he controlled. \n \n Lee, who lives in Monroeville, Alabama, has taken legal action to get the copyright reassigned but alleges Pinkus still received commissions. \n \n \"The transfer of ownership of an author's copyright to her agent is incompatible with her agent's duty of loyalty; it is a gross example of self-dealing,\" the lawsuit says. \n \n The former agent's son-in-law didn't immediately return a call seeking comment. \n \n \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" won the Pulitzer for fiction and is widely assigned in schools.

Close \n \n Harper Lee, the 87-year-old author of \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird,\u201d sued her literary agent, claiming he took advantage of her age and infirmity to deprive her of royalties from the novel. \n \n Lee, of Monroeville, Alabama, sued Samuel Pinkus, the agent, and others seeking to ensure her ownership of the copyright to the 1960 novel and to compel forfeiture of the agent\u2019s commissions, according to a complaint filed yesterday in federal court in New York. \n \n Lee, who has failing eyesight and hearing, was residing in an assisted-living facility in 2007 after suffering a stroke when she signed a document assigning her copyright to Pinkus\u2019s company, according to the complaint. While the copyright was re- assigned to Lee last year after legal action and Pinkus was discharged as Lee\u2019s agent, he was still receiving royalties from the novel as of this year, according to the complaint. \n \n \u201cPinkus knew that Harper Lee was an elderly woman with physical infirmities that made it difficult for her to read and see,\u201d Gloria Phares, Lee\u2019s lawyer, said in the complaint. \u201cHarper Lee had no idea she had assigned her copyright\u201d to Pinkus\u2019s company. \n \n There was no immediate response yesterday to a message left on the voice-mail of Leigh Ann Winick of Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, a defendant in the suit and the wife of Pinkus, according to the complaint. She is listed as the president of Keystone Literary LLC, a defendant. \n \n Also named as a defendant is Gerald Posner, identified as a New York lawyer and investigative journalist who incorporated one of Pinkus\u2019s businesses. Posner didn\u2019t immediately respond to an e-mail sent to his website yesterday seeking comment on the lawsuit. \n \n Judgment, Arbitration \n \n Lee\u2019s literary agent for many years was McIntosh & Otis, according to the complaint. When its principal, Eugene Winick, became ill in 2002, his son-in-law, Pinkus, took over and diverted several McIntosh clients to a company he controlled, according to the complaint. McIntosh later won a judgment against Pinkus\u2019s company in an arbitration over commissions he diverted from the firm, according to the complaint. \n \n \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird,\u201d a story of racial injustice in the American South, won a Pulitzer Prize for fiction and was made into a film starring Gregory Peck, who won an Oscar for playing the lawyer Atticus Finch. It is Lee\u2019s only published novel. The book has sold more than 30 million copies worldwide. \n \n The case is Lee v.

I don\u2019t say that with any degree of hubris, but I think what I can say is look what I did to the attorney general\u2019s office. Look what we did in a series of substantive areas, from the well known such as Wall Street, obviously, to the less well known \u2014 community gardens. The low wage labor cases. The proposal I had when I was governor to let undocumented immigrants to get drivers\u2019 licenses.

And that\u2019s important. \n \n (PHOTOS: Eliot Spitzer's career) \n \n Q: But is two months enough time to do it? \n \n A: For most people, there\u2019s a visceral response that is generated reasonably quickly as we approach election day or based upon inputs over multiple years. Frankly, I think the larger reality I face is that it\u2019s going to be hard for me to change the public perception of me and the public perception will either win or not. But changing it with even the best communications strategy in the world probably won\u2019t accomplish a whole lot. People remember me looking through the prism as attorney general, as governor and how I left \u2014 the good, the bad and the ugly.

Given all the differences of powers and staff, is that comparison fair? \n \n A: I won\u2019t know until I\u2019m there. But do I think that there\u2019s a real metaphor there? Absolutely. Do I think that the opportunity to use the buckets of jurisdiction that I\u2019ve been discussing in the comptroller\u2019s office? Absolutely.

This is strictly about \u2018me, me, me,\u2019 and it\u2019s a neediness that I don\u2019t understand but we see all the time in Washington.\u201d \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset Anthony Weiner announces NYC mayor run Sanford ad outlines \u2018mistakes\u2019 \n \n The sex scandals of the past decade have come with such frequency that one could almost set them to music, a la Billy Joel\u2019s \u201cWe Didn\u2019t Start the Fire\u201d: Mark Foley\u2019s emails, John Ensign\u2019s coverup, David Vitter and the D.C. Madam, shirtless Chris Lee, Herman Cain\u2019s harassment, Jim McGreevey as \u201cgay American,\u201d John Edwards\u2019s love child. And this is by no means a comprehensive list. A common theme is a mingling of professional positions with sexual adventurism, and a seeming conviction that huge vulnerabilities in private lives would somehow not come to public light. Edwards ran for president even after lover Rielle Hunter was carrying his baby \u2014 one Edwards claimed was fathered by an aide \u2014 and still nurtured fantasies that he could maneuver his way into being Barack Obama\u2019s attorney general after the National Enquirer disclosed his affair. \n \n Of course, the historical record, dating from JFK to FDR to the Roman Empire, offers many examples of leaders who mixed public service with private extramarital indulgences. What is much more common now is their ultra-public disclosure \u2014 and the accompanying ability of politicians to rebound from what once were almost always career-ending scandals when personal lapses became known. \n \n On sexual matters, Bill Clinton of course set the modern standard for resilience after being impeached during the Monica S. Lewinsky uproar and seeing his poll numbers rise. Like Richard Nixon before him, said historian Michael Beschloss, Clinton embraced the importance of never giving up and always being seen as a survivor. Contemporary politicians like Weiner and Spitzer may be making a similar calculation, he said, that perceived character defects can be turned into assets through perseverance \u2014 \u201cthat people will admire their determination to not be defeated.\u201d \n \n But the ease with which politicians recover from scandal says less about the character of politicians than the character of the times, said Doug Sosnik, a close adviser to Bill Clinton in his second term. Because of the \u201ccoarsening of our society\u201d \u2014 with voters subject to constant news of bad behavior among leading figures in sports and popular entertainment, as well as politics \u2014 \u201cit is almost impossible to disappoint anyone\u2026The expectation is that everyone does everything.\u201d \n \n In addition, with respect for leaders in nearly all sectors of society at historically low levels, voters look at candidates through a practical prism, not a sentimental one: Are they competent and effective?

Behind him in the courtroom, his mother buried her head in her hands. \n \n The teenage girl wept in her mother\u2019s arms nearby. In a statement, the girl and her family said the convictions delivered \u201ca measure of justice\u201d for victims of sexual violence. \n \n \u201cWhile he was not convicted on all charges, Owen Labrie was held accountable in some way by a jury of his peers for crimes he committed against our daughter,\u201d a family spokeswoman read to a throng of reporters outside the courthouse. \u201cThere is no joy in this outcome, however, as our daughter can never get back what she has lost.\u201d \n \n Labrie left the courthouse without comment, but his lawyer, J.W Carney Jr., said Labrie was devastated. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \u201cOwen\u2019s future is forever changed,\u201d Carney said, likening the conviction to a brand that \u201cwill stay with him the rest of his life.\u201d \n \n The trial revealed the sexual culture at the highly selective 159-year-old boarding school, whose notable alumni include Secretary of State John F. Kerry and \u201cDoonesbury\u2019\u2019 creator Garry Trudeau. Annual tuition exceeds $50,000, although many students, like Labrie, receive scholarships. \n \n In often-crude testimony, jurors heard how Labrie and his friends sought to \u201cslay\u201d \u2014 a slang term for having sex \u2014 as many girls as they could, using their status on campus to woo underclassmen in a rite known as the \u201csenior salute.\u201d \n \n In its statement, the girl\u2019s family said they still felt betrayed that the school \u201callowed and fostered a toxic culture that left our daughter and other students at risk to sexual violence.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe trusted the school to protect her and it failed us,\u201d they said. \n \n Advertisement \n \n The school, in its own statement, did not respond directly to complaints that it had failed to curb such behavior, but it praised the girl for her resolve. \n \n \u2018\u2019 \n \n Electronic messages read during trial indicated that for months, Labrie had a crush on the younger student, a sister of a classmate, before inviting her to meet that night. He brought a blanket and a condom to a secluded mechanical room. \n \n Their stories diverged from that point. The girl tearfully testified that Labrie had sex with her over her multiple objections, ignoring her efforts to keep her bra and underwear on. \n \n Labrie described a playful, consensual encounter in which he decided against having sex after a moment of \u201cdivine inspiration.\u201d \n \n Jurors found Labrie guilty of three counts of misdemeanor sexual assault, endangering a child, and using computer services to lure a minor, a felony that carries a maximum sentence of seven years in jail. \n \n The sexual-assault charges would commonly be referred to as statutory rape, which is typically a felony. In this case, however, they were misdemeanors because, the indictment read, the difference in age between Labrie and the girl was four years or less. \n \n Carney, meanwhile, said the jury concluded the sexual encounter was mutual and that the convictions for misdemeanor assaults were based on the girl\u2019s age. \n \n \u201cOne teenager was found guilty of having consensual sex with another teenager,\u201d he said. \n \n Carney described the computer-enticement charge as \u201coverreaching\u201d and indicated he may appeal. He said the law, which applies to juvenile victims younger than 16, was not meant to apply to teenagers making social plans. \n \n Carney said Labrie\u2019s comments to several friends that he had sex with the girl were the \u201cmost damning\u201d evidence against him. Labrie, in his testimony this week, said he lied about what happened in order to show off. \n \n \u201cIf he knew then what would result, he would have told his friends the truth,\u201d Carney said. \n \n Carney said he will seek probation with \u201cserious conditions.\u201d Prosecutors declined to specify what sentence they will recommend until a review is conducted before a hearing slated for late October. \n \n Labrie will remain free on $15,000 bail, although prosecutor Catherine Ruffle urged higher bail, saying Labrie could flee now that he has been convicted. \n \n \u201cThe circumstances have changed,\u201d she said. \n \n Prosecutors credited the teenage girl for her courage during the trial, and said the convictions \u201csend a message\u201d that victims of sexual assault can find justice. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a testament to the courage of the young woman,\u201d said Scott W. Murray, Merrimack County attorney.

Follow him on Twitter @globepete ||||| Concord, New Hampshire (CNN) A New Hampshire jury on Friday convicted Owen Labrie of five counts -- including one felony -- in connection with the sexual assault of another student at a prestigious boarding school, but it acquitted him of more serious charges. \n \n Labrie, 19, a former student at the elite St. Paul's School, appeared shaken as the verdict was read, at one point nodding his head and reaching for a tissue to wipe tears. \n \n At the time of the assault, the accuser was 15 and Labrie was an 18-year-old senior. \n \n In the end, the jury did not appear to believe the former prep school student's claim that there was no intercourse, but it also seemed to dismiss his accuser's testimony that it was against her will, CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin said. \n \n Labrie was convicted of a felony charge and four misdemeanors: the most serious count being the use of an online service or the Internet to seduce, solicit or entice a child under age 16 in order to a commit sexual assault. He also was convicted of three counts of misdemeanor sexual assault and child endangerment. \n \n At his October 29 sentencing, Labrie faces a maximum sentence of 11 years. Labrie, who will have to register for inclusion on the sex offender list, was released on bail under a 5 p.m. to 8 a.m. curfew. \n \n He was acquitted of the more serious counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault -- punishable by 10 to 20 years in prison -- as well as simple assault, a misdemeanor. \n \n There were no winners in the case, Hostin said. \n \n \"In New Hampshire, forcible rape -- the requirement to have force -- is not an issue,\" she said. \"It's only consent. And so the jury clearly did not believe that she did not consent and that's why we have the felonies tossed out. Let's be clear, those were the most important charges for this prosecution.\" \n \n Labrie's conviction, however, ensures that he's added to the sex offender registry, Hostin said. \n \n \"That's a problem with these sex cases,\" she said. \"We have to look at them a little bit differently because no does mean no, and no is not necessarily a word, 'no' can be an action. Our sex laws really need to evolve.\" \n \n The jury, made up of nine men and three women, deliberated for 7\u00bd hours. \n \n \"In essence, what happened as a result of this trial is one teenager was found guilty of having consensual sex with another teenager,\" Labrie's lawyer, J.W. Carney, said after the hearing. \n \n He said the internet-related charge was actually intended to prosecute people who disguise their age and try to lure unsuspecting children into sexual encounters, not people like his client. \n \n \"I believe that this computer statute was never intended for kids getting together consensually at the high school they both attend,\" he said. \"It's overreaching.\" \n \n The victim's family said: \"A measure of justice has been served for victims of sexual violence. While he was not convicted on all charges, Owen Labrie was held accountable in some way by a jury of his peers for crimes he committed against our daughter.\" \n \n \"This conviction requires him to take ownership for his actions and gives him the opportunity to reflect upon the harm he has caused. There is no joy in this outcome, however, as our daughter can never get back what she has lost nor can St. Paul's School ever be our community again.\" \n \n In the statement, the family said it felt \"betrayed that St. Paul's School allowed and fostered a toxic culture that left our daughter and other students at risk to sexual violence. We trusted the school to protect her and it failed us.\" \n \n St. Paul's Rector Michael G. Hirschfeld, in a statement, commended the \"remarkable moral courage and strength demonstrated by the young woman who has suffered through this nightmare.\" \n \n \"Her resolve and unwavering commitment to the truth have been inspiring to us and to many outside our School community. We can only hope that time will bring some measure of healing and comfort to both her and her family. The entire St. Paul's School community has been deeply affected by this incident. It is our responsibility to ensure that our students live and learn together in a community that is built on respect, caring, and support for one another. Anything short of that cannot and will not be accepted.\" \n \n On Wednesday, Labrie -- with his accuser watching in the courtroom -- took the stand and described the encounter last year as consensual. He said the two of them sneaked into an attic room in a St. Paul's School academic building a few days before graduation and together spread a flannel blanket Labrie had brought with him. \n \n In closing arguments, prosecutor Joseph Cherniske told the jury that the defendant carefully planned out a sexual assault and viewed the taking of the girl's virginity as a source of pride. \n \n \"It wasn't the school's fault,\" he said, rebutting the defense argument that St. Paul's encouraged a tradition known as the \"Senior Salute\" in which seniors sought to have sexual encounters with younger students. \n \n Carney accused St. Paul's of allowing the \"Senior Salute\" to flourish. \n \n \"The idea that you would wink at a tradition that 'Senior Salute' represents is shocking,\" he said, denying that his client sexually penetrated the girl. \n \n \"It damages children and in this case it damaged both (the accuser) and Owen,\" he said. \"When you saw the culture of St. Paul's, it was one that encouraged, I submit, the concept of 'Senior Salute.' In fact, it was so revered on the campus it became a tradition.\" \n \n In a statement to the \"St. Paul's School Community,\" Hirschfeld and James M. Waterbury, president of the school board, denied that the \"Senior Salute\" was a tradition at the 159-year-old prep school. \n \n \"The phrase 'senior salute' describes a wide range of behaviors,\" the statement said. \"It was never understood to include the conduct engaged in by Owen Labrie. That behavior was never condoned by the School, and we took action when it surfaced.\" \n \n The statement said Labrie was banned from the school and his rector's award was rescinded. In addition, the student handbook was revised to \"state more explicitly that participation in any 'game' of sexual conquest by any name ... would be grounds for expulsion.\" \n \n On Wednesday, Labrie testified that sweatshirts, shirts and later pants were removed but the two kept their underwear on. \n \n When a defense attorney asked about their demeanor, Labrie testified they were both giggling and smiling and that the girl held him in an affectionate way. \n \n \"I thought she was having a great time,\" he said. \n \n Labrie, 18 at the time, said he may have gotten carried away at times, leading to bruises she reported on her breasts. They were both aroused, he said, so he went to put a condom on, but he stopped himself. \n \n \"It wouldn't have been a good move to have sex with this girl,\" he told the court. \"It would not have been a good choice for me to make.\" \n \n The liaison awkwardly ended after a few more brief kisses, and Labrie hurried to a choir concert, he said. \n \n Her testimony \n \n The accuser, now 16, testified last week that Labrie penetrated her with his fingers before raping her. \n \n \"I was raped!\" she said when a defense attorney suggested she had sent conflicting signals to the defendant. \n \n The defense depicted Labrie as a great student, on a full scholarship, who wanted to attend Harvard, take divinity classes and perhaps become a minister. \n \n The prosecution repeatedly questioned him about telling friends after the encounter that he had sex with the girl. \n \n He was bragging and lying, Labrie told the court. \n \n He also said for the first time that his boxers were damp and he may have ejaculated on them before he put on a condom. He didn't tell police about it, he said, because their questions focused on whether the two had sex. \n \n \"This was a very difficult case because of Owen's own statements to his friends,\" defense lawyer Carney said after the trial. \"I think the critical evidence was not the testimony of the complainant, it was the testimony of Owen given when he was talking to his friends and acting like a teenager who didn't want to say he had been unsuccessful in his 'Senior Salute.' \" \n \n State criminalist Katie Swango said semen and sperm were found on the young woman's underwear. Further testing of sperm cells found on the underwear were inconclusive. However, some of the biological material found on the underwear matched Labrie's DNA, she said. \n \n JUST WATCHED Key DNA evidence presented in prep school rape trial Replay More Videos ...

    "document": "Megyn Kelly, host of \"The Kelly File\" on Fox News, is back from vacation -- and Donald Trump wasted no time resuming his attacks on her. \n \n Shortly after Monday night's broadcast, Kelly's first since Aug. 12, Trump fired off a series of tweets critical of her, including a retweet in which she was called a \"bimbo\" and another that remarked on her looks. \n \n Here's the Republican presidential candidate's reaction to the broadcast, which featured an interview with teacher and activist Cornel West: ||||| Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s fracas with Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly isn\u2019t over yet. \n \n Kelly, host of The Kelly File, returned to work Monday after a 10-day family vacation. And Trump quickly let the Twitter universe know what he thought about that. \n \n First, he commented on her interview with author and activist Cornel West: \n \n .@megynkelly must have had a terrible vacation, she is really off her game. Was afraid to confront Dr. Cornel West. No clue on immigration! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 25, 2015 \n \n Then he shared his opinions on Kelly\u2019s show: \n \n I liked The Kelly File much better without @megynkelly. Perhaps she could take another eleven day unscheduled vacation! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 25, 2015 \n \n And finally, he retweeted some responses to his Kelly comments, including: \n \n \"@mstanish53: @realDonaldTrump @megynkelly The bimbo back in town . I hope not for long .\" \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 25, 2015 \n \n Kelly hasn\u2019t directly replied to Trump\u2019s tweets. Before his barrage began, she simply put up this: ||||| Fox News host Megyn Kelly, who\u2019s been on the receiving end of Donald Trump\u2019s attack machine since the first Republican presidential debate, announced on her show this week that she\u2019d be taking a vacation -- but the network says it has nothing to do with the Trump controversy. \n \n \u201cIt's been six months since I had a vacation,\u201d Kelly said on \u201cThe Kelly File\u201d Wednesday. \u201cSo I'll be taking the next week-and-a-half off, spending some time with my husband and my kids trying to relax.\u201d \n \n The announcement, which some news outlets have called \u201csudden,\u201d has generated speculation that Kelly hasn\u2019t been able to handle the blowback from asking Trump about past sexist remarks, which the Republican presidential candidate called unfair. Even Trump guessed Friday that Kelly was taking time off on account of the controversy, saying there \u201cprobably was [a connection], but I wouldn\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d \n \n \u201cPeople were very surprised that, all of the sudden, she decided to go away for 10 days,\u201d Trump added. \n \n But a Fox News spokeswoman released a statement Friday saying Kelly\u2019s vacation was planned long ago, and dismissed the \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d about her taking a little time off. \n \n \u201cThe conspiracy theories about Megyn Kelly\u2019s vacation rank up there with UFO's, the moon landing and Elvis being alive,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cMegyn is on a pre-planned, annual summer vacation with her family, which is much deserved. To imply otherwise, as Donald Trump and his campaign operatives have, is not only wildly irresponsible, but downright bizarre.\u201d \n \n The network noted that Fox News hosts Bill O'Reilly and Gretchen Carlson had also recently taken time off. The statement also addressed Trump in particular, and expressed the network\u2019s support of its star anchor. \n \n \u201cPerhaps Mr. Trump thinks it's advantageous to his poll numbers to keep talking about Megyn, but that doesn't change the fact that Roger Ailes has fully supported her and her tough journalistic questioning since day one and is thrilled with the added exposure from the debate, which resulted in even higher ratings of The Kelly File this week,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cAnyone who knows Roger is aware of how historically and consistently loyal he is to all of his talent and how he protects them at all costs.\u201d \n \n \ufeff\ufeffAlso on HuffPost: ||||| In the wake of GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump's refusal to apologize to Fox News' Megyn Kelly, one of the moderators of last week's GOP debate, for his controversial comments about her, we've rounded up all of the times Trump has apologized for something he's said: \n \n So far, the list is empty. In a cursory Internet search of recent Trump-related kerfuffles, it appears that Donald Trump has never publicly apologized for anything. \n \n Following the much talked about, much \"meme'd\" GOP debate, Trump claimed that Kelly had it out for him and made a comment about how she had \"blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her... wherever,\" while asking him questions. \n \n That quip didn't go over well. He was told not to come to a major gathering of conservatives, known as the Red State conference, held in Atlanta, Georgia, over the weekend. But he told CNN's Jake Tapper that his remarks were misunderstood, and that he \"said nothing wrong whatsoever.\" \n \n Trump believes that if anyone should be issued an apology, it's him. He told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" that Kelly owes him an apology for her questions aimed at the candidate. \n \n Remember Trump's comments about Sen. John McCain? Mexican immigrants? Rosie O'Donnell? \n \n Yeah, he isn't apologizing for any of those either. \n \n Trump denied saying that McCain wasn't a war hero, but remarked that he would like to see him do more to help war veterans. Not an apology per se, but more like a half-denial, half-apology hybrid. \n \n His comments on Mexico and immigrants? Nope. No apology. Back in July, he told Fox News Channel's \"MediaBuzz\" that his controversial comments about Mexican immigrants being rapists and murderers stemmed from media reports on crime near the border, and therefore he \"can never apologize for the truth.\" \n \n On calling women that he didn't agree with fat pigs, slobs or disgusting animals (particularly O'Donnell)? Nothing to be sorry for there, either. \n \n \"What I say is what I say,\" Trump replied during the GOP debate when Kelly asked if this type of temperament was appropriate for the office of president of the United States. \"And honestly, Megyn, if you don't like it, I'm sorry,\" he continued. \"I've been very nice to you, although I could probably maybe not be, based on the way you have treated me.\" \n \n There has been one apology out of Trump's camp, however. Alas, it didn't come from the mogul himself, but rather his lawyer. \n \n Amidst reports of a decades-old rape allegation disclosed in Trump's early 1990s divorce from then-wife Ivana, his lawyer Michael Cohen made the comment that \"you cannot rape your spouse.\" \n \n Cohen later apologized for this remark after Trump distanced himself from the situation.",

    "document": "The giraffe tends to appear in parents\u2019 lives sometime around the birth of a first child. It\u2019s 7.5 inches tall, squeaky, and vaguely vanilla-scented. Its pupil-less eyes have the same blank, dazed expression newborns might recognize in the sleep-deprived parents dangling the toy above their crib. \n \n If you have birthed a child or given a baby gift at any point in the last five years, you may well have encountered Sophie the Giraffe. Sophie doesn\u2019t make children smarter or improve cognitive development or any other benefit more high-tech toys promise. It\u2019s just a rubber teether, distinguished from the thousands of other animal-shaped rubber teethers on the market primarily by its $24.99 retail price. In contrast, a perfectly serviceable set of Nuby teething keys\u2014another baby favorite\u2014is $4.99 at BabiesRUs. \n \n Yet in less than a decade Sophie went from being a virtual unknown in the US to the go-to baby gift for the upper-middle class. Roughly 500,000 Sophies are sold in the US each year. Its price point is right in prime baby shower gift territory. The giraffe is the 10th most popular baby item on Amazon, alongside staples like changing pads and breast milk storage bags. \n \n The giraffe\u2019s rise to fame is a starlet\u2019s tale of obscure rural beginnings, an LA discovery, and a few lucky breaks. \n \n In France, where the toy manufacturer Vulli produced its first Sophie on May 25, 1961, la girafe is a childhood staple. Sophie sales match or surpass annual birth rates. \n \n So when French expatriate H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Dumoulin-Montgomery gave birth to her daughter in California in 2000, she looked for a toy Sophie for her baby like the one she\u2019d had as a child. Sophie wasn\u2019t sold in the US at the time. Dumoulin-Montgomery, who then worked part-time as a realtor\u2019s assistant, contacted Vulli and asked for permission to import the toy. \n \n The company was ambivalent, Dumoulin-Montgomery said. (Vulli did not respond to Quartz\u2019s requests for comment.) After middling sales in neighboring western European countries, Vulli was content to focus on the French market. Nonetheless, the company agreed to grant Dumoulin-Montgomery a license to distribute the toy stateside. \n \n In 2001, Dumoulin-Montgomery received her first shipment of 100 Sophies. Nobody wanted them. \n \n \u201cShe was expensive. Everyone was comparing it to toys [made] in China,\u201d she recalled via Skype while on vacation in France. (Her company, Calisson, Inc., is based in Orange County, California.) \n \n \u201cI had a face to face with Sophie and said, \u2018How am I going to sell you?\u2019\u201d \n \n Sophie\u2019s fate changed in 2004 after a meeting with Teri Weiss, owner of the Beverly Hills gift boutique Elegant Child. Weiss crafts custom gift baskets destined for the offspring of high rollers in LA\u2019s entertainment and finance scenes. She sells doll strollers more expensive than the strollers most people buy for their actual children. Dumoulin-Montgomery arrived at Weiss\u2019s offices with a duffel bag full of children\u2019s clothing and toys recently imported from France. \n \n \u201cI remember it like yesterday,\u201d Weiss recalled. \u201cShe brought a bag. I didn\u2019t like anything. Nothing. And then at the bottom I saw this little giraffe, with no packaging or anything. I pick it up. It\u2019s the right color and shape. I said, \u2018That would look great in my basket.\u2019\u201d Dumoulin-Montgomery had six Sophies in the trunk of her car. Weiss bought them all. \n \n She put a Sophie that same day in a basket a Hollywood agent was gifting a client, the actress Kate Hudson, who had just given birth to her son Ryder. \n \n \u201cA week or so later, her assistant calls me and says, \u2018Kate Hudson received this basket.\u2019 It\u2019s literally a $500 basket, and her assistant says, \u2018Her son loves this giraffe.\u201d \n \n Demand rose as famous babies like Ryder Robinson were photographed gnawing on the toy. For the next four years, Elegant Child was one of Dumoulin-Montgomery\u2019s biggest clients. Weiss was sending out 100 to 125 rubber giraffes per day at the peak, she said. \n \n Sales exploded after the toymaker Mattel\u2019s 2007 recall of millions of lead-tainted Chinese-made toys. Sophie is made of natural rubber\u2014each giraffe spends three months curing on a tray in the factory in Rumilly, France\u2014and embellished with food-grade paint. \n \n Its success has led to unsubstantiated reports of imposter giraffes. Several parents have complained in Amazon reviews of receiving a giraffe they suspect is counterfeit, either because its painted spots faded (a normal occurrence in the genuine toy, Dumoulin-Montgomery said) or it has a funky chemical smell. Neither Dumoulin-Montgomery nor Amazon was able to confirm cases of counterfeit Sophies. \n \n Sophie\u2019s US success convinced Vulli to invest in international marketing, Dumoulin-Montgomery said. The giraffe is now available in 75 different countries. If Sophie is on the higher end of toys in the US, in other countries she is practically gilded. In Brazil, the toy retails for roughly $50. In Europe Sophie is considerably cheaper\u2014\u00a38.99 ($13) on Amazon UK, \u20ac11 ($12.50) in her native France\u2014and thus more democratized. London mom Carol Horne was at a wedding in Amsterdam in 2011 when her then-6-month-old bit down on the toy\u2019s distinctive squeaker. Without turning around a Dutch woman two rows ahead said, \u201cAh\u2014Sophie!\u201d \n \n For this story, I informally surveyed roughly 30 parents with kids born after 2007, from Cape Town to London to New York. Nearly all of them had purchased or been gifted at least one Sophie at some point. \n \n \u201cI\u2019d never heard of Sophie until I got pregnant, and all of the baby registries listed it as a top pick,\u201d said Stephanie Paterik, a New York journalist expecting her first child in August. \u201cI\u2019m still unclear about what she is/does, but registered for her anyway.\u201d \n \n Sophie isn\u2019t a universal panacea. Several parents surveyed for this story reported that their children never cared for the toy. At least two family dogs tried to commandeer it as their own. \n \n But for those babies who do take to the giraffe, Sophie holds a near-hypnotic sway. My own daughter gummed hers reverentially. An increasingly worn Sophie appears in almost every photo taken of her in her infancy. That graspable neck, chewable legs, and soothingly empty expression appeals in a way Sophie\u2019s fans are incapable of explaining. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s her face. There\u2019s something magical about it,\u201d Dumoulin-Montgomery said. \u201cI wish I could go in the head of a baby just to know.\u201d ||||| When parents discovered mold in their \"Tommee Tippee Sippee\" cups last year, people everywhere were horrified. Well, we have more bad news: Sophie the Giraffe isn't safe either. Recent reports from parents reveal people have found mold growing inside of the popular toddler teething toy. \n \n As a pediatric dentist, Dana Chianese recommends teething toys to parents every single day, including Sophie the Giraffe (which her two boys under the age of three prefer), but not anymore. A month ago she decided to clean the toy and noticed the air coming out of the hole smelled musty. \"I decided to cut into Sophie out of curiosity and discovered a science experiment living inside,\" Chianese told Goodhousekeeping.com. \"Smelly, ugly mold living in my infant's favorite chew toy!\" \n \n Dana Chianese \n \n Chianese says she always cleaned the toy according to instructions, using hot, soapy water with a damp sponge and never submerging it into water. \"It still hurts my heart to know that for months I allowed my babies to chew on moldy toys,\" she says. \"I no longer buy any chew toys with a hole or recommend any to my patients.\" \n \n And she's not the only one: On Amazon, one reviewer tried to alert others to what she found when she cut the legs off of her child's teething toy and even shared a picture for proof: \"Beware!! If you have a drooly baby, moisture will get in the hole and you'll end up with mold!\" says Amazon user Stephanie Opera. \"We've had ours for two years and the entire inside is coated with black mold!\" \n \n Stephanie Oprea via Amazon \n \n Meanwhile, a user on What to Expect shared her own pictures of the moldy toy. She says she only found the mold after she chopped off the legs after hearing reports of them getting caught in the throats of other babies. Let's just say, she had no clue she was about the uncover the real danger inside. \n \n What to Expect \n \n Dr. Lyuba Konopasek, an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at New York Presbyterian/Weil Cornell Medical Center told Care.com exposure to mold in toys is usually not something to be too alarmed about, unless your child has a immune disorder. However, if your child does have a mold allergy, they may start experiencing symptoms such as coughing or itchy eyes. \n \n So what can you do? \"The only way to prevent mold inside plastic toys is to make sure they are cleaned and thoroughly dried,\" says Carolyn Forte, the Director of the Cleaning Lab at the Good Housekeeping Institute. The best way to clean washable plastic toys is in hot sudsy water or in the dishwasher. Then, disinfect them with a solution of 1/2 cup Clorox bleach per gallon of water. Soak them for five minutes, rinse and air dry. \n \n How often you should clean these toys depends on the frequency of use. If used daily, Forte recommends cleaning them at least once a week. And don't let these items sit in water or leave them with water trapped inside between uses or cleanings. See update below for more information. \n \n Update, 1/16/2017: When contacted for comment, a spokesperson for Sophie the Giraffe, shared the following statement: \n \n First of all, it's important to know that Sophie la Girafe [Sophie the Giraffe] is composed of 100% natural rubber, so the cleaning instructions have to be carefully respected. As indicated on the packaging and in an explanatory leaflet inside the packaging, we recommend to clean the surface of Sophie la Girafe with a damp cloth. It should not be immersed in the water nor rinsed off, to prevent water from getting inside, as she may become damaged. We thus would like to emphasize on the fact that is it important, while cleaning the product, that no water gets inside the whole. As of now, we have not been contacted by Mrs. Chianese nor Mrs. Opera and were not aware of the situation before reading your article. It is thus difficult for us to comment on the current situation, as we haven't had the chance to examine the products. Please know that each complaint received is taken very seriously and that the return of the product is always asked for further examination. Furthermore, please know that the safety of children and satisfaction of their parents is our main priority. For the past 55 years, we have always strived to exceed security standards and all of our products comply with the most stringent global standards. \n \n Update, 1/17/2017: After hearing from the manufacturers of Sophie the Giraffe, we checked in again with Carolyn Forte, Director of the Cleaning Lab at the Good Housekeeping Institute. \"You should always follow the advice for cleaning a toy that a manufacturer provides,\" she says. \"Sometimes there is special care required that may be different from other toys your child owns. Always check a toy's packaging for care instructions before discarding it or if the packaging has already been tossed, check the manufacturer's website.\" \n \n That said, Forte questioned how practical a teething toy might be that can't be thoroughly washed. ||||| Parents surprised at mold growth inside Sophie the Giraffe toy \n \n Hi, parents. Welcome to Babies 101. First lesson? Babies drool. A lot. And they like to suck on toys. A lot. Moisture in an enclosed space can cause mold to grow, which should be common sense. \n \n Apparently, it\u2019s not. \n \n In the latest edition of Parent\u2019s Freaking Out, we have moms and dads upset that their child\u2019s Sophie the Giraffe teething toy is full of mold. Dana Chianese, a pediatric dentist and mother of two toddler sons, tells Good Housekeeping of her horrifying discovery after noticing a musty smell coming from the hole of her child\u2019s Sophie toy. \u201cI decided to cut into Sophie out of curiosity and discovered a science experiment living inside,\u201d she explains. \u201cSmelly, ugly mold living in my infant\u2019s favorite chew toy!\u201d \n \n Though Chianese followed the cleaning instructions that came with the toy, wiping it down with hot, soapy water and never submerging it, the mold still grew. Understandably, the mom is shaken, saying, \u201cIt still hurts my heart to know that for months I allowed my babies to chew on moldy toys. I no longer buy any chew toys with a hole or recommend any to my patients.\u201d \n \n OK, ew. Like, all the ew. We won\u2019t deny that this would be a jarring discovery for any parent, and in the haze of our exhausting lives raising small people who hardly let us sleep, we might forget tiny details. Like the fact that mold growing inside a toy a baby constantly sucks on shouldn\u2019t be a huge surprise. \n \n Yet, Amazon has more than one review, including cautionary photos of gross Sophie toys full of blackish-colored mold, with stories just like Chianese\u2019s. User Stephanie Oprea writes, \u201cBeware!! If you have a drooly baby, moisture will get in the hole and you\u2019ll end up with mold! We\u2019ve had ours for two years and the entire inside is coated with black mold!\u201d \n \n Behold, the grossness. \n \n Another reviewer writes, \u201cMy 8-month-old grandson had this giraffe. When it started giving off a foul odor, my son cut it open to find the inside covered with mold. It was not used as a bath toy, but was washed in order to clean it.\u201d \n \n Alright, we get it. It\u2019s shocking and disgusting, but again, shouldn\u2019t come as a huge surprise. And mold is more than just yucky to look at, the CDC says it can cause health issues including respiratory symptoms, itchy eyes and even skin reactions. Luckily, it doesn\u2019t have to be this way, since there are easy ways to keep plastic toys with holes in them clean. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Cleaning website The Maids has several suggestions for keeping bath toys and teething toys clean and free of mold. The most practical and baby-safe among them are: \n \n Vinegar \n \n Mix together 1 gallon of water with \u00bd cup of white vinegar and let the toys soak in this solution for about an hour. Give them a scrub once the mold is loose and then let them dry. If they still smell like vinegar, just do a simple rise and dry before placing them back in the toy bin. \n \n The Dishwasher \n \n Running bath toys through the dishwasher also sanitizes and kills any gunk or mold that may be growing on both the inside and out. It seems like an overly simple method, but it gets the job done. \n \n Boiling Water \n \n Take the toys and boil them in hot water and squeeze out any of the \u201cyuck\u201d from the insides with some tongs. Let them cool and dry thoroughly. \n \n So, it\u2019s not Sophie\u2019s fault she gets moldy. She just needs a proper cleaning, like any other plastic or rubber toy with a hole in it that your baby regularly gums on.",

It also raised concerns in Japan and the United States, and followed new U.N. sanctions against North Korea over its sixth nuclear test earlier this month. \n \n The South\u2019s Unification Ministry said its aid policy remained unaffected by geopolitical tensions with the North. The exact timing of when the aid would be sent, as well as its size, would be confirmed later, the ministry said in a statement. \n \n The South said it aimed to send $4.5 million worth of nutritional products for children and pregnant women through the World Food Programme and $3.5 million worth of vaccines and medicinal treatments through UNICEF. \n \n \u201cWe have consistently said we would pursue humanitarian aid for North Korea in consideration of the poor conditions children and pregnant women are in there, apart from political issues,\u201d said Unification Minister Cho Myong-gyon. \n \n UNICEF\u2019s regional director for East Asia and the Pacific Karin Hulshof said in a statement before the decision the problems North Korean children face \u201care all too real\u201d. \n \n \u201cToday, we estimate that around 200,000 children are affected by acute malnutrition, heightening their risk of death and increasing rates of stunting,\u201d Hulshof said. \n \n \u201cFood and essential medicines and equipment to treat young children are in short supply,\u201d she said. \n \n The last time the South had sent aid to the North was in December 2015 through the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) under ex-president Park Geun-hye. \n \n DOG BARKING \n \n South Korea\u2019s efforts aimed at fresh aid for North Korea dragged down Moon\u2019s approval rating. Realmeter, a South Korean polling organization, said on Thursday Moon\u2019s approval rating stood at 65.7 percent, weakening for a fourth straight month. \n \n Although the approval rate is still high, those surveyed said Moon had fallen out of favor due to North Korea\u2019s continued provocations and the government\u2019s decision to consider sending aid to North Korea, Realmeter said. \n \n Moon will meet Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Trump later on Thursday on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, where North Korea was expected to be the core agenda item. \n \n In an address on Tuesday, Trump escalated his standoff with North Korea over its nuclear challenge, threatening to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d the country of 26 million people if the North threatened the United States and its allies. \n \n Trump also mocked its leader, Kim Jong Un, calling him a \u201crocket man\u201d. \n \n North Korea\u2019s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho called Trump\u2019s comments \u201cthe sound of a dog barking\u201d. \n \n \u201cThere is a saying that goes: \u2018Even when dogs bark, the parade goes on\u2019,\u201d Ri said in televised remarks to reporters in front of a hotel near the U.N. headquarters in New York. \n \n \u201cIf (Trump) was thinking about surprising us with dog-barking sounds then he is clearly dreaming,\u201d he said. \n \n Asked by reporters what he thought of Trump calling North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \u201crocket man\u201d, Ri quipped: \u201cI feel sorry for his aides.\u201d \n \n North Korea conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test on Sept. 3 and has launched numerous missiles this year, including two intercontinental ballistic missiles and two other rockets that flew over Japan. \n \n Such provocations have sparked strong disapproval from the international community, especially from the United States and Japan. ||||| (CNN) North Korea's foreign minister has delivered a scornful response to US President Donald Trump's threat to destroy the hermit kingdom, likening it to the sound of \"a dog barking.\" \n \n Ri Yong Ho, who is in the US for the United Nations General Assembly, said he \"felt sorry\" for the President's advisers after a fiery speech to the UN on Tuesday. \n \n In his debut address to world leaders, Trump vowed to \"totally destroy\" North Korea if the US was forced to defend its allies. \n \n Referring North Korean leader Kim Jong Un by a nickname he first used in in a tweet Sunday , Trump said: \"Rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.\" \n \n Ri, in his country's first response to Trump's speech, was derisive. \"If he was thinking he could scare us with the sound of a dog barking, that's really a dog dream,\" Ri told reporters outside his hotel in New York. In Korean, a dog dream is one that is absurd and makes little sense. \n \n When asked about Trump's use of the \"rocket man\" nickname, Ri said: \"I feel sorry for his aides.\" \n \n North Korean diplomats were not present for Trump's speech. \n \n North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho, left, shakes hands with North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Pak Myong Guk as he leaves the Pyongyang Airport on Tuesday. \n \n Little chance of meeting \n \n US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is also in New York, but played down the possibility of a meeting with his North Korean counterpart. \n \n Pyongyang and Washington do not maintain formal diplomatic relations and the presence of North Korea's top diplomat in the US could have afforded a rare chance for high-level, face-to-face dialogue. \n \n Tillerson told reporters he did not believe he could have a \"matter-of-fact discussion with North Korea because we don't know how their means of communication and behavior will be.\" \n \n JUST WATCHED N.

He said there was evidence of fuel shortages in the country after the passage of recent UN sanctions , which targeted oil imports among other things. \n \n However, analysts pointed out that fuel shortages did not necessarily prove that sanctions were having an effect, as most North Koreans don't own cars or use fuel at anywhere near the rate of the rest of the world. \n \n Anthony Ruggiero, an expert in the use of targeted financial measures at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, said sanctions rarely hit fast. Any lines for gas were \"probably more due to the regime stockpiling fuel in anticipation that China would implement the restriction,\" Ruggiero, who worked at both the State Department and Treasury Department, told CNN. \n \n Humanitarian aid \n \n Trump is scheduled to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean President Moon Jae-in Thursday, two important US allies on North Korea's doorstop. \n \n Top of the agenda is likely to be South Korea's surprise decision to send an $8 million aid package to North Korea. The move, which runs contrary to the US and Japan's calls for an increase in economic and diplomatic pressure, marks a resumption in South Korean aid after a break of almost two years. \n \n In statement Wednesday, the South's Unification Ministry said the decision to resume aid was in line with \"the government's stance that it separates the provision of humanitarian aid from politics and it continues to provide aid to improve the humanitarian situation of North Korean residents and the quality of their lives.\" \n \n The South said it planned to send $4.5 million worth of medical treatments, nursery facilities and nutritional products for children and pregnant women through the World Food Programme, and $3.5 million worth of medicinal treatments and nutritional products through UNICEF. \n \n The precise timing and actual provision would be dependent on various factors, including \"inter-Korean relations,\" the ministry said in a statement. \n \n Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about the North Korean situation in a phone call Monday, the White House said. Accounting for about 90% of North Korea's imports, Beijing is seen by many as the key to any North Korea strategy. \n \n While China voted in favor of the two most recent UN resolutions against North Korea, Chinese diplomats have called for calm as Trump's rhetoric has heated up, and editorials in Chinese state media have continued to assail the US President's approach to diplomacy. \n \n \"It is time for the US to realize that irresponsible words and actions are backing the DPRK into a corner with no way out, and it would be a tragedy if Trump's risky game of chicken with the DPRK crosses the point of no return,\" read an editorial published Thursday in the People's Daily , the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party. \n \n \"Rather than hurl threats and try to pass the buck to China, the US should accept its responsibility, and do more to resolve the issue through dialogue and negotiation.\" ||||| Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Mr Trump has taken to calling Kim Jong-un \"rocket man\" \n \n North Korea's top diplomat has called US President Donald Trump's speech to the UN \"the sound of a barking dog\". \n \n Speaking to the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, Mr Trump said he would \"totally destroy\" North Korea if it posed a threat to the US or its allies. \n \n Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho's comments were North Korea's first official response to the speech. \n \n The North has continued to develop its nuclear and weapons programmes, in defiance of a UN ban. \n \n Mr Ri told reporters near the UN headquarters in New York: \"There is a saying that goes: 'Even when dogs bark, the parade goes on'.\" \n \n \"If [Trump] was thinking about surprising us with the sound of a barking dog then he is clearly dreaming.\" \n \n Speaking about North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, Mr Trump had told the UN: \"Rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and his regime.\" \n \n When asked what he thought of Mr Trump calling Mr Kim \"rocket man\", Mr Ri responded: \"I feel sorry for his aides.\" \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Trump: 'Rocket Man's suicide mission' \n \n Mr Ri is set to make a speech to the UN on Friday. \n \n Separately, on Thursday South Korea said it would send fresh humanitarian aid to the North for the first time in nearly two years. \n \n The unification ministry in Seoul plans to provide $8m (\u00a36m) through UN programmes aimed at children, pregnant women and improving medical supplies. \n \n The decision comes days after the UN approved new sanctions against Pyongyang, restricting oil imports and banning textile exports - an attempt to starve the North of fuel and income for its weapons programmes. \n \n The UN sanctions came in response to the North's latest nuclear test on 3 September. \n \n Experts say North Korea has made surprisingly quick progress in its development of long-range missiles and nuclear weapons.",

Morning people: researchers found that cognitive performance is better in the morning for older adults, compared with in the afternoon. \n \n The researchers, from the Rotman Research Institute at Baycrest Health Sciences and the University of Toronto in Canada, publish their results in the journal Psychology and Aging. \n \n \"Time of day really does matter when testing older adults,\" says lead author John Anderson. \"This age group is more focused and better able to ignore distraction in the morning than in the afternoon.\" \n \n He and his colleagues note that their study provides the strongest evidence yet that there are measurable differences throughout the day in brain function for older adults. \n \n To conduct their research, the team observed 16 younger adults between the ages of 19-30 and 16 older adults between the ages of 60-82 as they took part in a sequence of memory tests between 1:00 and 5:00 pm. \n \n For these tests, the participants needed to study and recall a set of picture and word combinations that appeared on a computer screen. As a means of distraction, the researchers programmed irrelevant words linked to certain pictures and irrelevant pictures linked to certain words to appear on the screen. \n \n While the participants were completing the testing, the researchers scanned their brains with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which allowed them to observe which areas of the brain were activated. \n \n Older adults tested in morning activated same brain areas as younger group \n \n The researchers found that the older adults were 10% more likely to focus on the distracting information than the younger adults, who largely blocked out this information successfully. \n \n Additionally, the data gleaned from the fMRI scans showed that the older adults showed significantly less activity in the attentional control areas of the brain in the afternoon, compared with the younger adults. \n \n The older adults who were tested in the afternoon showed signs of \"idling,\" the researchers say, which means they were showing activations in the default mode - a set of regions that are activated when a person is resting or thinking about nothing in general. \n \n This could indicate that the adults were having a hard time focusing, because when a person is fully aiming their attention at something, resting state activations are suppressed. \n \n But there is a silver lining for older adults. The team found that when another group of 18 older adults was tested in the morning between 8:30 and 10:30 am, they performed significantly better. \n \n In detail, they focused on fewer distracting items than their peers who were tested in the afternoon, and they even closed the age difference gap in performance with the younger adults. \n \n When the older adults were tested in the morning, the researchers observed that they activated the same brain areas as the young adults did to ignore the distractions. And this could suggest that time of day when older adults are tested is an important factor in how well they perform and what kind of brain activity researchers can expect from them. \n \n Commenting on the findings in the older adult group, Anderson explains: \n \n \"Their improved cognitive performance in the morning correlated with greater activation of the brain's attentional control regions - the rostral prefrontal and superior parietal cortex - similar to that of young adults.\" \n \n Older adults should schedule mentally taxing activities for morning \n \n Dr. Lynn Hasher, senior author on the paper, says their research \"is consistent with previous science reports showing that at a time of day that matches circadian arousal patterns, older adults are able to resist distraction.\" \n \n She adds that ignoring time of day when testing older adults on certain tasks \"may create an inaccurate picture of age differences in brain function.\" \n \n In light of their findings, Anderson recommends that older adults schedule their most mentally difficult tasks - such as doing taxes, taking a test, seeing a doctor about a new condition or cooking a new recipe - in the morning. \n \n Medical News Today recently reported on a study that suggested people who can quickly process visual information in later life are more likely to stay mentally acute as they age. ||||| A new study provides strong evidence of noticeable differences in brain function through the day for older adults. \n \n Canadian researchers discovered older adults perform better on demanding cognitive tasks in the morning. Moreover, brain imaging shows that during this time of the day, elders also activate the same brain networks responsible for paying attention and suppressing distraction as younger adults \n \n The study, as published in the journal Psychology and Aging, has yielded some of the strongest evidence yet that there are noticeable differences in brain function across the day for older adults. \n \n \u201cTime of day really does matter when testing older adults. This age group is more focused and better able to ignore distraction in the morning than in the afternoon,\u201d said lead author John Anderson, a doctoral candidate in psychology at the University of Toronto\u2019s Rotman Research Institute at Baycrest Health Sciences. \n \n \u201cTheir improved cognitive performance in the morning correlated with greater activation of the brain\u2019s attentional control regions \u2014 the rostral prefrontal and superior parietal cortex \u2014 similar to that of younger adults.\u201d \n \n Asked how his team\u2019s findings may be useful to older adults in their daily activities, Anderson recommended that older adults try to schedule their most mentally challenging tasks for the morning time. \n \n Those tasks could include doing taxes, taking a test (such as a driver\u2019s license renewal), seeing a doctor about a new condition, or cooking an unfamiliar recipe. \n \n In the study, 16 younger adults (aged 19 \u2013 30) and 16 older adults (aged 60-82) participated in a series of memory tests during the afternoon from 1:00 \u2013 5:00 p.m. \n \n The tests involved studying and recalling a series of picture and word combinations flashed on a computer screen. Irrelevant words linked to certain pictures and irrelevant pictures linked to certain words also flashed on the screen as a distraction. \n \n During the testing, participants\u2019 brains were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) which allows researchers to detect with great precision which areas of the brain are activated. \n \n Older adults were 10 percent more likely to pay attention to the distracting information than younger adults who were able to successfully focus and block this information. \n \n The fMRI data confirmed that older adults showed substantially less engagement of the attentional control areas of the brain compared to younger adults. \n \n Indeed, older adults tested in the afternoon were \u201cidling\u201d \u2014 showing activations in the default mode (a set of regions that come online primarily when a person is resting or thinking about nothing in particular) indicating that perhaps they were having great difficulty focusing. When a person is fully engaged with focusing, resting state activations are suppressed. \n \n When 18 older adults were morning tested (8:30 a.m. \u2013 10:30 a.m.) they performed noticeably better, according to two separate behavioral measures of inhibitory control. \n \n They attended to fewer distracting items than their peers tested at off-peak times of day, closing the age difference gap in performance with younger adults. Importantly, older adults tested in the morning activated the same brain areas young adults did to successfully ignore the distracting information. \n \n This suggests that \u2018when\u2019 older adults are tested is important for both how they perform and what brain activity one should expert to see. \n \n \u201cOur research is consistent with previous science reports showing that at a time of day that matches circadian arousal patterns, older adults are able to resist distraction,\u201d said Lynn Hasher, Ph.D, senior author on the paper. \n \n Experts believe the findings should inform those who study cognitive function in older adults. \n \n \u201cSince older adults tend to be morning-type people, ignoring time of day when testing them on some tasks may create an inaccurate picture of age differences in brain function,\u201d said Hasher, senior scientist at the University of Toronto. \n \n Source: Baycrest Centre for Geriatric Care",

(Associated Press) \n \n Toronto Mayor Rob Ford speaks during a press conference to advocate relief for the people in the Philippines affected by Typhoon Haiyan, Tuesday, Nov. 12, 2013 in Toronto. A defiant Toronto Mayor Rob... (Associated Press) \n \n Ford's refusal to resign over his admitted drug use has confounded Toronto's City Council. Allies and opponents alike agree that a stream of revelations of the mayor's erratic behavior _ from smoking crack cocaine in a \"drunken stupor\" to threatening to kill someone in a videotaped tirade _ has consumed Toronto's politics and has impacted the City Council's ability to tackle other challenges. \n \n But with no clear legal path to force him out, the 44-member City Council is grasping for ways to shunt the larger-than-life leader aside and govern without him until next year's municipal elections. \n \n It is an unprecedented effort but in some ways, it may not be a stretch. Toronto's mayor already has limited powers compared to the mayors of many large cities in the United States. He is just one voting member in the council and his power stems mostly from his ability, as the only councilor elected by citywide vote, to build consensus and set the agenda. That authority, many council members say, has evaporated in the crack scandal. \n \n \"We really just have to build a box around the mayor so we can get work done,\" said councilor John Filion, who has introduced one of two motions in the council designed to isolate Ford. \n \n The first motion, which goes to a vote Wednesday, would call on Ford to take a leave of absence, apologize to Toronto residents for misleading them and cooperate with police. If he refuses, the council would ask the province of Ontario to pass legislation to remove the mayor from office. \n \n The City Council has no authority itself to oust Ford because he has not been convicted of a crime. Toronto police said last month they had obtained a long-sought video of Ford apparently smoking from a crack pipe but that it does not constitute enough evidence to charge him. \n \n The motion was introduced by City Councilor Denzil Minnan-Wong, who had been a supporter of the conservative Ford's policies since the mayor took office three years ago, riding a backlash from suburbanites who felt alienated by what they deemed Toronto's downtown-centric, liberal-dominated politics. \n \n In an opinion piece in the Globe and Mail, Minnan-Wong said he had been encouraged by Ford's election \"because we shared the same policy aims: frugal government, working to eliminate waste, contracting out work where it made sense, and respect for the tax dollars of Torontonians.\" \n \n \"No longer can he set an agenda for council or build a consensus among its members,\" wrote Minnan-Wong, who is on Ford's executive committee. \"No longer is there confidence in his judgment. Rightly or wrongly, Mr. Ford has lost the moral authority to lead.\" \n \n News reports of the crack video's existence first surfaced in May, but it has not been released publicly. \n \n After police announced they had the video, Ford confessed that he smoked crack last year while drunk and apologized. But he insisted he is not addicted to drugs and does not need rehab. He says he is ready to make his case before the increasingly hostile City Council. \n \n \"It's going to be rumble in the jungle tomorrow,\" Ford said Tuesday, as he autographed a \"Robbie Bobbie\" bobblehead doll at City Hall. \n \n Despite the growing cries for Ford to go, the motion is unlikely to pass. Many councilors are loath to ask Ontario's provincial government to intervene in Toronto's municipal affairs, fearing it would set a dangerous precedent. Provincial government officials have publicly expressed reluctance to do so. \n \n Another proposed motion would curtail Ford's powers, suspending his authority to appoint and dismiss the deputy mayor and his executive committee, which runs the budget process. It likely won't be debated until December because of the council's procedural rules. \n \n Filion, the councilor who introduced that motion, said the idea is to prevent Ford from firing executive committee members _ such as Minnan-Wong _ who speak out against him. Councilors are also considering stripping Ford's authority to set the City Council's agenda, said Councilor Adam Vaughan, who opposes getting the province involved. \n \n \"We will shun him, curtail his power as best we can,\" Vaughan said. \"He clearly has gone off the deep end, shot himself in outer space.\" \n \n While Ford, 44, has lost political leverage, his core supporters have not lost faith in the populist mayor who refers to them as \"Ford Nation.\" \n \n \"It won't be the end of Ford Nation, they just put up a billboard in support of him last week,\" said Nelson Wiseman, a political professor at the University of Toronto. \"The movement and the anti-government sentiment it embodied that got him elected will stay alive ... His base will remain strong whether or not he's removed from office.\" \n \n After winning office in 2010, Ford took measures that pleased his suburban voter base, including abolishing an annual $60 vehicle registration tax, squeezing valuable concessions out of the union representing 6,000 city workers, and reducing costs by contracting out half of Toronto's garbage collection. Ford claims to have saved taxpayers $1 billion dollars in the process, though councilors dismiss that claim as highly inflated since he has increased the cost of transit, among other public services, along with hiking property taxes. \n \n City councilors say the mayor's travails are creating chaos around efforts to confront Toronto's most difficult challenges, including developing public transit service and reduce grinding commutes. \n \n Ford opposes a proposed, fully-funded, light-rail transit plan in favor of a more expensive subway extension into a suburb where his support runs strong. \n \n The subway project _ already controversial because it will force the city to raise taxes and seek federal and provincial money _ has been engulfed in chaos since the mayor took office and was further impacted after the allegations surfaced in May that Ford had been filmed smoking a crack pipe. As the mayor's influence eroded, councilors debated back and forth on the issue, voting on and then reversing its decisions several times, until making a final decision weeks ago. \n \n \"After the news surfaced about his personal life, that further disintegrated things,\" Filion said, adding that it caused councilors to distance themselves from Ford. \"People are just openly scornful of him whereas six months ago they may have thought he was a wonderful mayor, and so we now have this fairly large power vacuum that someone needs to step in and fill.\" \n \n At least one city councilor has been steadfast in his support of the mayor: his brother, Doug Ford. \n \n \"They are going to get up, 44 of them, and give my brother a public beating, a public butchering,\" Doug Ford said ahead of Wednesday's proceedings. \"I'm going to have to stand there and watch it happen so we'll see how it turns out.\" ||||| Hundreds of people are snatching up bobblehead dolls of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, signed by the embattled politician himself. \n \n Toronto Mayor Rob Ford autographs a bobblehead doll in his likeness Tuesday, Nov. 12, 2013, at city hall in Toronto.

Councilors will today consider a motion that would call on Rob Ford to apologize, take a leave of absence, and cooperate with a police investigation into his activities, CBC reports. Just one problem: Even if it passes (Ford, who made the motion the key item at today's council meeting, has promised a \"rumble in the jungle\" debate), Ford won't actually have to heed the request. If he refuses, the City Council can ask Ontario to pass legislation removing him, but the council itself can't remove him from office since he hasn't been convicted of a crime\u2014and councilors are hesitant to ask Ontario to step in. With \"no clear legal path to force him out,\" the AP reports, the council is looking for a way to isolate Ford and run the city without him, which could actually be possible, since the powers of the Toronto mayor are more limited than the powers of many mayors in big US cities. \"We really just have to build a box around the mayor so we can get work done,\" says one councilor. A second option to be debated next month: a motion that would further limit Ford's powers, basically keeping him from being able to fire executive committee members who want him out. \"We will shun him, curtail his power as best we can,\" says another councilor. \"He clearly has gone off the deep end, shot himself in outer space.\" Much of the public, though, still loves Ford: Hundreds lined up to buy \"Robbie Bobbie\" bobblehead dolls yesterday; they're being sold for charity.",

EMBED </>More News Videos Investigators say the woman suspected of kidnapping a 7-week-old baby from the King of Prussia Mall on Thursday night had been claiming to be pregnant. \n \n \"King of Prussia Mall has 24/7 state-of-the-art security protocols both inside and outside the property, including a robust security force and continuous patrol routes. Our emergency procedures were operationalized instantly, including the deployment of law enforcement personnel. The results of these efforts, in partnership with our local law enforcement officials, resulted in the happy outcome of returning the baby safely to his family and we are incredibly thankful of their support.\" \n \n Authorities have identified and charged the woman accused of abducting a 7-week-old baby from the King of Prussia Mall on Thursday night, and we're also learning new details about the incident.Cherie Amoore, 32, has been charged with kidnapping of a minor, unlawful restraint, false imprisonment, interference with the custody of a child, concealment of the whereabouts of a child and other related charges. She was arraigned and held on $500,000 cash bail.The baby, Ahsir Simmons, was found safe a few hours after the abduction.Amoore said nothing going into court for her arraignment on Friday, but she and relatives openly wept inside the courtroom.\"It's a very difficult day for everyone. Difficult for her, difficult for her family, and you saw her in the courtroom. She was shaken,\" said public defender Greg Nester.According to police documents, Amoore told detectives she gave birth to a boy on Feb. 11, but the baby only lived a few hours, and she never told anyone the child had died.She then allegedly told police, \"I don't know why I did it. I can't explain it. I held him, and all those feelings rushed back. I just wanted my baby. I felt like I was holding my son again. It felt so good. I didn't want to lose that feeling. I was crazy. I never intended to do anything like this.\"Police have not been able to confirm that pregnancy, and friends of Amoore tell Action News they were skeptical she was pregnant.The kidnapping was reported at around 5:45 p.m. Thursday.Police say Amoore had approached the family and began talking with the mother, asking how old the baby was. During the course of the conversation, Amoore allegedly said she had a baby about the same age.Amoore followed them around while engaging in small talk, went to stores with them, followed them to the food court, and sat at their table, according to the affidavit.When the mother arrived after getting food, police say Amoore was still at the table.According to the affidavit, Amoore asked the mother if she could hold the baby, but was told \"no.\" While the mom was helping other children, police say the baby began to cry and Amoore took him from his stroller and began to console him.The mom told police she was distracted by the other children and, when her back was turned, Amoore ran off with the baby. She started to chase after Amoore, but lost sight of her when she turned to check on her other son, who was still at the table.Two people sitting nearby pointed out which direction Amoore went, police say, but by then she was gone.Chopper 6 was overhead as police searched cars at the mall.Investigators say, after the kidnapping, Amoore took little Ahsir to show him to relatives.However, once news of the abduction emerged and surveillance video of the abductor was released, police say family members recognized her and notified police.Meanwhile, police reviewed video showing Amoore talking to another woman shortly before the abduction. That woman also helped police identify the suspect.Those tips brought police to a home above a barber shop in Tredyffrin Township, Chester County, where Ahsir was found safe and Amoore was taken into custody.Police say when she answered the door, Amoore said \"I took the baby and I am sorry.\" The baby was asleep in a car seat belonging to Amoore, police say.\"She has told our investigators that she did not go to the mall with intention to steal a baby,\" said Chief Tom Nolan.\"I just got up and walked away,\" Amoore is quoted as saying in the police affidavit. \"I remember walking, it was like an out of body experience.\"Action News was there as baby Ahsir was reunited with his family at the Upper Merion police station.His mother, Malika Hunter, said, \"I would like to thank God for allowing my baby to come back. And, I want to thank the Upper Merion Police Department, and everybody on social media that helped me get my baby back. I want to thank you so much.\"Hunter says she has not been able to sleep since her ordeal. She tells Action News she is still in shock about what happened, and now fears taking her children outside.\"For you to come along to take somebody else's child to fill your void, and try to leave me with one is not right,\" said Hunter. \"I have a sister that suffered the same loss, but you don't see her out here kidnapping and stealing people's children.\"\"I lost my son and I was hurt, and what I never want to do is put that hurt on somebody else,\" said Quydeira Hunter, sister. \"So for her to use that as an excuse, that's not an excuse.\"Hunter, who also has another young son, Ahmad, says her children are her world. And while she is deeply grateful to have Ahsir back, the ordeal has left her deeply scared.\"From this situation, I don't wanna go outside anymore, I don't want to take my kids out, I just want to keep my kids in the house where they're safe,\" said Hunter. \"I don't trust no one. Now I feel as though if I go somewhere, my kids are a target now. I don't wanna go nowhere.\"Cherie Amoore is the daughter of Renee Amoore, who is both the deputy chairman of the Republican Party of Pennsylvania and a panelist on 6abc's \"Inside Story.\" She had no comment outside court.Shoppers were in disbelief that something like this could happen with all the police presence and surveillance cameras at the mall.\"It's unbelievable. That's crazy,\" said Sara Elhollal of King of Prussia. \"I feel so bad for the mother.\"And yet there were others who were completely oblivious to what was happening.\"They didn't make an announcement.

That's what she needs.\" \n \n For many smartphone users the official Amber Alert notification was not sent until around four hours after the baby was kidnapped. In the state of Pennsylvania, sending out an Amber Alert is a process with at least three steps. Local authorities notify the state police, the state police notify the National Center for Missing Children in Washington, DC, and then the National Center for Missing Children sends the alert to phones. \n \n Before law enforcement officials issue an Amber Alert they must first believe an abduction occurred and that the child, under the age of 17, is in imminent danger. They also need enough descriptive information to assist in a recovery. Chief Nolan insisted those criteria were quickly met on a local level. \n \n \"I know that the Amber Alert that went out through the Upper Merion Police Department went out to all surrounding jurisdictions in Montgomery County within the first few minutes,\" he said. \n \n What Caused the Amber Alert Delay During KOP Mall Kidnapping Case? \n \n What caused the delay in the Amber Alert notification after the King of Prussia Mall kidnapping?

(Los Angeles Fire Department via Storyful) \n \n A fast-spreading brush fire north of Los Angeles forced hundreds of people to evacuate their homes Friday and Saturday as firefighters struggled against triple-digit temperatures and erratic winds to contain the blaze, officials said. \n \n Within a day, the wildfire \u2014 named the La Tuna Fire for its origin in La Tuna Canyon to the north of Burbank \u2014 had grown to cover more than 5,000 acres, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department. In all, about 300 homes in Burbank, 250 homes in Glendale and 180 homes in Los Angeles were under evacuation as of Saturday afternoon. \n \n As of Saturday, the fire was 10 percent contained. Although no injuries were reported, one home had been destroyed, the fire department said. \n \n \u201cThis continues to be a very dynamic fire,\u201d Los Angeles Fire Chief Ralph M. Terrazas said at a news conference Saturday. \u201cThe weather conditions are somewhat stable, but that could change at any moment.\u201d \n \n [San Francisco smashes all-time high, hits 106 degrees] \n \n Terrazas added he was confident the fire had burned \u201cwell above\u201d 5,000 acres as of Saturday afternoon, but he was not able to give a fixed acreage. Earlier in the day, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti confirmed that by acreage, the blaze was the largest in the city\u2019s history. \n \n Fire officials said erratic wind and weather were posing the greatest challenges to extinguishing the fire. Authorities were particularly concerned about how quickly the blaze could spread in the area\u2019s canyons. \n \n \u201cThis is a slow burning, \u2018backing\u2019 fire (meaning it burns down hill) and we have resources at the base of the hills to defend homes,\u201d fire spokeswoman Margaret Stewart said in a statement. \u201cWhen the fire encounters a canyon, it can accelerate and burn uphill.\u201d \n \n Video taken Saturday morning near La Tuna Canyon Road, over the hills to the north of Burbank, showed flames and heavy smoke. \n \n The La Tuna Fire was first reported about 1:30 p.m. Friday as a small, one-acre vegetation fire south of Interstate 210 near Burbank. Although firefighters quickly extinguished the bulk of that fire, high winds caused embers to jump across the highway, sparking a spot fire north of I-210, Stewart said. \n \n Within a few hours, more than 250 firefighters from multiple agencies had been dispatched to the fire, which had grown to 500 acres and shut down a portion of I-210. \n \n By 9 p.m. Friday, the fire had tripled in size to 1,500 acres. Authorities soon ordered mandatory evacuations, street by street, for neighborhoods in Burbank closest to Verdugo Mountain Park.

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File) (Associated Press) \n \n NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Sears' biggest shareholder appears to be pushing for a breakup of the 125-year-old company that has survived two world wars and the Great Depression. \n \n Chairman and CEO Edward Lampert \u2014 whose hedge fund has forwarded millions in funding to keep the ailing chain afloat \u2014 has asked the struggling retailer to sell its prominent Kenmore appliance brand and its home improvement business, the company said Monday. \n \n The private equity firm ESL Investments said it might buy the assets if the company is willing to sell. That sent shares of Sears Holding Corp., which have lost more than 70 percent of their value in the past year, up nearly 5 percent. \n \n Lampert, who combined Sears and Kmart in 2005 after helping bring Kmart out of bankruptcy, has long pledged to turn the company's fortunes around. He said the retailer would find ways to capitalize on its best-known brands like Kenmore appliances and DieHard car batteries, as well as its vast holdings of land. \n \n But as the company has seen shoppers move on to Target, Walmart and Amazon, and has closed hundreds of stores, cut costs and sold brands to deal with falling sales, Lampert now appears to have reconsidered. \n \n In his letter to the board, Lampert said Sears has been trying to sell the Kenmore businesses for nearly two years but it has been unable to do so. \n \n Kenmore could have substantial value. Amazon.com began selling Kenmore appliances on its site almost a year ago.

Its storied catalog featured items from bicycles to sewing machines to houses, and the company's stores were a fixture of suburban malls from the 1950s to 1970s. ||||| Sears CEO Eddie Lampert has proposed a deal to raise cash for the struggling department-store chain. AP \n \n Sears CEO Eddie Lampert has proposed a massive deal between the retailer and his hedge fund, ESL Investments, to raise cash for the struggling department-store chain. \n \n In a letter dated April 20, Lampert proposed that ESL Investments purchase Sears' Kenmore brand, its home-improvement business, its Parts Direct division, and some of the company's real estate. Sears' shares spiked more than 8% in early-morning trading Monday. \n \n \"We understand that Sears has marketed certain of these assets for nearly two years but, with the exception of the Craftsman divestiture, has been unable to reach agreement with potential purchasers on acceptable terms,\" Lampert wrote in the letter, which Sears posted on its website on Monday. \n \n He said ESL valued Sears' home improvement and Parts Direct businesses at $500 million collectively. \n \n He also said ESL would \"be open to making an offer for Sears' real estate,\" including the assumption of $1.2 billion in debt obligations tied to the properties. \n \n The deal would raise much-needed cash for the struggling department-store chain, which has been selling off brands and real estate to stay afloat amid years of falling sales. \n \n The company's sales have dropped from $53 billion in 2006 to $16.7 billion in 2017. \n \n In a statement to Business Insider, an ESL spokesman said the firm hoped the proposal would \"enable Sears to improve its debt profile and liquidity position, creating the runway to help continue its transformation, and allow these businesses to unlock their considerable potential by further expanding their presence in the marketplace.\" \n \n Here's the full letter: \n \n Ladies and Gentlemen, \n \n Funds affiliated with ESL Investments are the largest stockholders of, and substantial lenders to, Sears Holding Corporation (\"Sears\"). We continue to see value in Sears and its underlying assets and believe strongly that with an appropriate runway Sears will be able to complete its transformation to respond to the challenging retail environment. We also are of the view that the portfolio of Sears' assets has substantial value that is not being reflected in the capital markets or being maximized under the current organizational structure. These assets include the Kenmore brand and related assets (\"Kenmore\"), the Home Improvement business of the Sears Home Services division (\"SHIP\"), and the Parts Direct business of the Sears Home Services division (\"Parts Direct\"). \n \n We understand that Sears has marketed certain of these assets for nearly two years but, with the exception of the Craftsman divestiture, has been unable to reach agreement with potential purchasers on acceptable terms. We are writing to confirm the view that we have recently expressed to you that Sears should aggressively pursue a divestiture of all or a portion of Kenmore, SHIP and Parts Direct and to express ESL's interest in participating in such divestitures. In our view, pursuing these divestitures now will demonstrate the value of Sears' portfolio of assets, will provide an important source of liquidity to Sears and could avoid any deterioration in the value of such assets. In particular: \n \n ESL believes that Kenmore is an iconic brand with substantial value and Sears should aggressively pursue a divestiture of all, or a portion of, Kenmore in the near term. If Sears believes it would be helpful, ESL would be prepared to submit a proposal for such a transaction and believes it would be able to close such a transaction within 90 days. \n \n ESL is pleased to submit a non-binding indication of interest to acquire SHIP and Parts Direct on the terms set forth below. \n \n Additionally, if requested by the Sears Board of Directors, ESL also would be open to making an offer for Sears' real estate (including the assumption of the $1.2 billion of debt obligations secured by such real estate), with the expectation of entering into an ongoing master lease for some or all of the stores to allow for their continued operation. \n \n ESL would like to emphasize that its principal interest is seeing that the Kenmore, SHIP and Parts Direct businesses are divested in the near term at a full and fair value, regardless of whether ESL or a third party is the ultimate buyer, so that Sears is able to improve its debt profile and liquidity position. As a result, to ensure a fair process, ESL hereby confirms that: \n \n Edward S. Lampert and Kunal S. Kamlani will not participate on behalf of Sears (as officer or director) in any discussions, deliberations, negotiations or decisions with respect to a potential transaction in which ESL participates as a buyer, except to the extent specifically requested by the committee referred to below. \n \n ESL will not participate in any such transaction as a buyer unless such transaction is both (i) recommended by the related party transaction committee (or another committee of independent directors) of the Sears Board of Directors, which is fully empowered to consider such transaction, and (ii) approved by the holders of a majority of the shares of Sears held by disinterested stockholders. \n \n ESL would accept that any transaction in which ESL participates as a buyer would be subject to a \"go shop\" process on reasonable terms. \n \n We believe that adherence to the foregoing procedures will ensure that any transaction with ESL will be on fair and reasonable terms. \n \n Key terms of our proposal to acquire SHIP and Parts Direct are set out below: \n \n Valuation: We are interested in acquiring 100% of the equity of SHIP and Parts Direct based on an enterprise value of $500 million. The purchase price would be paid in cash and SHIP and Parts Direct would be acquired on a debt-free and cash-free basis with normalized levels of working capital. Other Agreements: We would expect that Sears will enter into certain interim and long-term agreements with SHIP and Parts Direct to enable the continued operation of those businesses as they operate today. These agreements would include transition services agreements with Sears for a period of time, a brand licensing agreement for SHIP and Parts Direct and other customary ancillary documents for a transaction of this type. Our proposal is also subject to receiving the required consents to assign the supplier agreements to the buyer from the suppliers of each of SHIP and Parts Direct. Financing: The cash consideration for the transaction would be financed with equity contributions from ESL and third party debt financing. At the appropriate time, we would also be open to discussing with you the possibility of partnering with third parties who might be interested in contributing equity financing. We do not anticipate any financing condition, since we plan to have our financing fully committed at the time we sign a definitive agreement. Exchange and Tender Offers: The transaction would be undertaken in connection with (i) an exchange offer with respect to 50% of approximately $600 million in outstanding 2nd lien indebtedness not secured by real estate for equity in Sears of equal value, and (ii) a tender offer for 100% of Sears' approximately $900 million in outstanding unsecured indebtedness at a discount to par reflective of the current trading prices or, alternatively, for Sears equity. ESL believes that the exchange offer and the tender offer would be beneficial to the debt holders, by providing liquidity, to Sears, by reducing its debt obligations, and to equity holders, by reducing risk and giving Sears time to pursue value maximizing strategies. Assuming the proceeds from the contemplated divestitures is sufficient to allow Sears to substantially reduce its overall leverage, ESL would consider participating in such exchange offer and tender offer. Timing and Advisors: We are prepared to move as quickly as possible to complete customary due diligence for a transaction of this nature and enter into definitive agreements. We believe that an expedited process is in the best interest of all parties involved. We have retained Moelis & Company as financial advisor and Cleary Gottlieb Steen& Hamilton LLP as legal counsel. Please feel free to reach out to any of the below regarding this Proposal. \n \n This letter reflects ESL's non-binding indication of interest. Nothing in this letter should be considered to constitute or create a binding obligation or commitment of ESL to proceed with, or consummate, any transaction. Any transaction among the parties will be subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the execution and delivery of a mutually acceptable definitive agreement. \n \n This proposal, including the exchange offer and tender offer and any alternative transactions with third parties, are part of a comprehensive solution to create a viable and healthy Sears, and will allow Sears to reduce its debt, extend its maturity profile and alleviate its liquidity challenges. \n \n We are very enthusiastic about our ownership interest in Sears and its future, and will remain so whether or not a transaction is consummated. We are available to discuss the foregoing at your convenience. \n \n Very truly yours, \n \n ESL INVESTMENTS, INC. \n \n /s/ Edward S. Lampert Edward S. Lampert Chairman and CEO",

    "document": "French lawmakers voted in favour Tuesday of a new law granting the state sweeping surveillance powers, despite criticism from civil society groups that have dubbed the bill the \u201cFrench Patriot Act\u201d. \n \n The bill passed the National Assembly with 438 votes in favour and just 86 against after it gained the backing of the two main parties \u2013 the ruling Socialists and the centre-right UMP. The bill will now go up before the French parliament\u2019s upper house, the Senate, in June. \n \n The latest intelligence bill is one of several government reforms in the wake of the January 7-9 Paris attacks that left 17 dead. France remains on high alert and has received repeated threats from jihadist groups, including the Islamic State (IS) group in the Syria-Iraq region. \n \n Rights groups, however, have slammed the new proposals, calling the raft of measures a \u201cFrench Big Brother\u201d. \n \n Speaking to FRANCE 24 Tuesday, Felix Tr\u00e9guer, founder of La Quadrature du Net -- a Paris-based group defending cyber rights --, warned that civil liberties were being overlooked in the push for reforms following the January attacks. \n \n \u201cThe fact is the law was being prepared for a long time,\u201d said Tr\u00e9guer. \u201cThe bill\u2019s advocates wanted a legal framework for the French intelligence agencies, which is a good thing. But the government is actually using the Paris attacks as an excuse for acting against terrorism, but the law is much broader than that. The range of motives that can be invoked to engage in intelligence collection include industrial and scientific espionage, monitoring social movements and so on.\u201d \n \n The authors of the bill, however, deny it will be used for mass surveillance and reject comparisons with the US Patriot Act passed a month after the September 11, 2001, attacks. \n \n \"We are not going for widespread monitoring because the US [case] has shown that to be useless,\u201d said Jean-Jacques Urvoas, a Socialist Party MP. \u201cThis is not going to be run on a predictive basis, we simply aim to ensure enhanced monitoring of those identified as threats.\u201d \n \n In the \u2018realm of the intelligence superpowers\u2019 \n \n Under the bill, private residences can be monitored using geo-location measures, mobile communications can be intercepted, and web usage and communication can be monitored with the help of so-called \u201cblack boxes\u201d attached to servers. \n \n Black boxes are complex algorithms that Internet providers will be forced to install to flag up a pattern of suspicious behaviour online and are among the most controversial of the bill\u2019s proposals \n \n A poll published last month showed that nearly two-thirds of French people were in favour of restricting freedoms in the name of fighting extremism. \n \n Only 32 percent of those surveyed in the CSA poll for the Atlantico news website said they were opposed to freedoms being reduced, although this proportion rose significantly among young people. \n \n Civil rights activists say the measures are not aimed solely at the prevention of terrorism but also will be used for foreign policy, as well as economic and scientific interests. \n \n \u201cThe French intelligence agencies do not have the budget and financial means of the [USA\u2019s] NSA (National Security Agency), but the logic behind some of the bill\u2019s provisions perfectly mirrors what\u2019s going on in the US and the UK in terms of the very broadly defined regime of international surveillance,\u201d said Tr\u00e9guer. \u201cThe bill is a way for France to retain its rank in the realm of the intelligence superpowers\u2026the bill is a way of continuing the arms race in terms of accumulating new surveillance powers.\u201d \n \n French Prime Minister Manuel Valls, however, has fiercely defended the bill, saying that to compare it to the mass surveillance \"Patriot Act\" introduced in the United States after the 9/11 attacks was a \"lie\". \n \n He has pointed out that the previous law on wiretapping dates back to 1991, \"when there were no mobile phones or Internet,\" which makes the new bill crucial in the face of extremist threats. \n \n (FRANCE 24 with AFP) \n \n Date created : 2015-05-05 ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Hugh Schofield on France's new surveillance rules \n \n The French parliament has approved a controversial law strengthening the intelligence services, with the aim of preventing Islamist attacks. \n \n The law on intelligence-gathering, adopted by 438 votes to 86, was drafted after three days of attacks in Paris in January, in which 17 people died. \n \n The Socialist government says the law is needed to take account of changes in communications technology. \n \n But critics say it is a dangerous extension of mass surveillance. \n \n They argue that it gives too much power to the state and threatens the independence of the digital economy. \n \n Main provisions of the new law: \n \n Image copyright AFP Image caption The government says it needs better surveillance to combat the terrorist threat \n \n Define the purposes for which secret intelligence-gathering may be used \n \n Set up a supervisory body, the National Commission for Control of Intelligence Techniques (CNCTR), with wider rules of operation \n \n Authorise new methods, such as the bulk collection of metadata via internet providers \n \n Surveillance law prompts unease in France \n \n Paris attacks: Three days of terror \n \n The government says it wants to bring modern surveillance techniques within the law rather than outside any system of control. \n \n A new watchdog will oversee the intelligence services, which will have broader powers to look at classified material and handle complaints from the public. \n \n But none of this has satisfied the critics, who range from civil liberties groups to major internet providers. \n \n Image copyright AP Image caption Protests against the new surveillance measures have been held in Paris \n \n Their main worry is the way French intelligence agencies will be able to collect massive amounts of metadata from the internet - the detail of communications such as times and places rather than content. \n \n Critics say this amounts to a mass intrusion of privacy, which in the hands of an unscrupulous government could have worrying consequences. \n \n Apart from some dissident voices, both the governing Socialists and opposition centre-right were in favour. \n \n One online advocacy group, La Quadrature du Net, wrote after the vote: \"Representatives of the French people have given the Prime Minister the power to undertake massive and limitless surveillance of the population. \n \n \"By doing so, they're ensuring that the power of the state and the basis of our democratic system are getting ever more distant from one another.\" \n \n Image copyright AP Image caption Those opposed to the proposed new law say that it will allow the government to keep a record of innocuous conversations \n \n Analysis by Hugh Schofield, BBC, Paris \n \n It has been an unusual debate. Many in the Socialist Party who would normally have spoken out against the new powers have instead kept quiet. In the wake of the January attacks, there is little political mileage in raising doubts about the intelligence services. \n \n Meanwhile on the right, with its clearer law-and-order tradition, most MPs support the Socialist bill. But some are opposed on points of principle. Irony of ironies, some of the harshest criticism has come from the Front National. \n \n The consensus means that the powerful civil liberties arguments have had little of an airing in the National Assembly. In some sessions there were no more than a handful of deputies in attendance. \n \n But the opposition from outside the chamber has been vocal. Not necessarily from the public at large (who by and large sympathise with the government's argument) but from rights groups, the press, and Internet companies. \n \n Surveillance law prompts unease in France",

A measure with the nickname the \"French Patriot Act\" cleared the lower house of Parliament in France today, reports France24. The legislation now goes to the Senate, where it seems likely to pass, reports the New York Times, which provides some specifics: The provisions would let intelligence services \"tap cellphones, read emails and force Internet providers to comply with government requests to sift through virtually all of their subscribers\u2019 communications.\" Advocates insist the monitoring would be directed at suspected terrorists, but critics don't buy it. A nine-person committee set up to oversee the surveillance would have only an advisory role and could not overrule the prime minister. The measure \"shows a number of tactics that seem cribbed from the NSA, including bulk collection of internet metadata, which would allow the government to track French citizens from site to site,\" notes a post at the Verge. The legislation also allows intelligence services to put microphones in a room or on objects to record conversations, and to use other devices to intercept phone conversations and text messages. The French debate follows the attacks on the Charlie Hebdo offices, and \"many in the Socialist Party who would normally have spoken out against the new powers have instead kept quiet,\" observes the BBC. \"In the wake of the January attacks, there is little political mileage in raising doubts about the intelligence services.\" (In the US, things seem to be moving in the opposite direction.)",

    "document": "'Alien: Covenant': Film Review \n \n Michael Fassbender, Katherine Waterston and Billy Crudup lead the ensemble of Ridley Scott's second installment in the 'Alien' prequel series. \n \n There's life in the old bugger yet. And, as always, plenty of death. After the Alien series looked as though it had hit the rocks creatively (not for the first time) with the last entry, Prometheus, five years ago, savvy old master Ridley Scott has resuscitated it, and then some, with Alien: Covenant, the most satisfying entry in the six-films-and-counting franchise since the first two. \n \n Gripping through its full two hours and spiked with some real surprises, this beautifully made sci-fi thriller will immeasurably boost fan interest in the run of prequels which Scott has recently said will consist of at least two more films until the action catches up to the 1979 original. This Fox release is a lock for major early summer box-office worldwide. \n \n Is there a director who has ever been artistically committed to a franchise as long as Scott has to the Alien series? None comes to mind (Steven Spielberg made his first Indiana Jones adventure, Raiders of the Lost Ark, in 1981, two years after Alien was released). It's a matter of record that Scott will turn 80 later this year, and Clint Eastwood will be 87 when he starts his new film; from the evidence on the screen, 80 may well be the new 50 where some top helmers are concerned, especially those who, like Scott and Eastwood, make a new film almost every year. \n \n It also helped to recruit a couple of very good writers, John Logan and Dante Harper, to dig the series out of its hole. No matter that these aliens have been around far longer than most of the viewers who will see this film opening weekend have been alive; this entry feels vital, freshly thought out and keen to keep us on our toes right up to the concluding scene, which leaves the audience with such a great reveal that it makes you want to see the next installment tomorrow. \n \n The elegantly spare opening, in which a \u201csynthetic,\u201d Walter (Michael Fassbender), engages his \u201cfather\u201d (an uncredited Guy Pearce) in a pointedly philosophical conversation, simply and effectively frames the thrust of the film's central interest in human life's origins and its prospects for survival. Casual viewers may assume that Walter is the same character Fassbender played in Prometheus. But, no, Walter, who sports an American, not British, accent, is an updated version of that all-purpose butler, factotum and technical wizard \u2014 a far friendlier iteration of the know-it-all computer Hal in 2001: A Space Odyssey. \n \n And as in 2001, Alien: Covenant involves a long outer space voyage during which the 2,000 human passengers, along with 1,140 embryos, will linger in a deep-freeze sleep for several years while the humanoid plays watchdog. The giant ship, called Covenant, is headed for a very distant planet, Origae-6, which is considered a promising new home for humanity to settle. For this reason, not only the slumbering immigrants, but the crew, too, are composed of prospective parents meant to propagate and establish a new homeland for homo sapiens. \n \n This couples-only orientation lends a fresh feel to this group of space travelers, and definitely cranks up the emotional distress quotient as partners start splitting open and giving birth to the wrong kind of offspring. When a space storm hits and damages the ship's giant wind sails, the first to perish is the ship's captain (James Franco, seen ever-so-briefly), which devastates his mate Daniels (Katherine Waterston), assigned to oversee terraforming on humankind's new planet. \n \n This accident promotes second-in-command Christopher (Billy Crudup) to run the show, but he's portrayed from the outset as uncertain and lacking in confidence; more than that, he's a \u201cperson of faith,\u201d which puts him at great philosophical odds with most of the others. Unfortunately, once this element is introduced, the writers don't do much with it, so it feels like a missed opportunity to engage in some pithy religion vs. science debate. Worse, the character's overriding weakness as a man won't go over too well with faith-based audiences. \n \n Not only that, but when the crew discovers a nearby \u201chidden planet\u201d that seems potentially compatible to human life, it's Christopher who makes the fateful decision to land there rather than to continue with their seven-year-long voyage. Farris (Amy Seimetz), the flier wife of the Covenant's main pilot Tennessee (Danny McBride), goes down for a peek and it looks pretty darn good, just like New Zealand, in fact, where half the world wants to move to right now. \n \n But as inviting as are the beautiful landscapes, mountains and lakes, there's trouble lurking in the magnificent flora and fauna and, given the particulars of this bloody franchise, it doesn't take long for humans to fall ill and start bursting with nasty and ferocious critters they never imagined could spring from their innards. This is not the sort of propagation the earthlings had in mind when they set off. \n \n In a brilliant stroke, the voyagers also encounter David, Walter's double, the very same \u201csynthetic\u201d who co-starred in Prometheus. Distinguishable from his supposedly new and improved relative by virtue of his long hair and British accent, this lone survivor of the previous voyage, who lives among the ruins of a great civilization wiped out by the aliens, gives Fassbender the delicious opportunity of a double performance. The actor makes the most of it, subtly delineating two nearly identical characters as they enact a contest for dominance, the details of which touch in clear but unpretentious ways on the notion of playing God. What goes down between the two remains uncertain right up to the fabulously diabolical twist ending. \n \n Scott and the writers have achieved an outstanding balance in Alien: Covenant among numerous different elements: Intelligent speculation and textbook sci-fi presumptions, startlingly inventive action and audience-pleasing old standbys, philosophical considerations and inescapable genre conventions, intense visual splendor and gore at its most grisly. The drama flows gorgeously and, unlike in many other franchises in which entries keep getting longer every time out, this one is served up without an ounce of fat. It provides all the tension and action the mainstream audience could want, along with a good deal more. \n \n Stylistically, the film is a thing of cool beauty, with superb effects and a lovely score. Creatively, it's a major reset on a level with the series' best. \n \n Production companies: Scott Free Productions, Brandywine Productions \n \n Distributor: Fox \n \n Cast: Michael Fassbender, Katherine Waterston, Billy Crudup, Danny McBride, Demian Bichir, Carmen Ejogo, Jussie Smollett, Callie Hernandez, Amy Seimetz, Benjamin Rigby, James Franco \n \n Director: Ridley Scott \n \n Screenwriters: John Logan, Dante Harper, story by Jack Paglen, Michael Green, based on characters created by Dan O'Bannon, Ronald Shusett \n \n Producers: David Gerber, Walter Hill, Ridley Scott, Mark Huffam, Michael Schaefer \n \n Director of photography: Dariusz Wolski \n \n Production designer: Chris Seagers \n \n Costume designer: Janty Yates \n \n Editor: Pietro Scalia \n \n Music: Jed Kurzel \n \n Visual effects supervisor: Charley Henley \n \n Special effects supervisor: Neil Corbould \n \n Casting: Carmen Cuba \n \n Rated R, 122 minutes ||||| Before chewing over the more predictable parts of Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cAlien: Covenant,\u201d let\u2019s salute a really smart thing that Mr. Scott and his writers, John Logan and Dante Harper, have done with the latest edition of the \u201cAlien\u201d saga. \n \n Seizing on the only source of sustained vitality in the director\u2019s 2012 film \u201cPrometheus,\u201d they\u2019ve made the most of it this time around. \u201cPrometheus,\u201d a sci-fi adventure set in the \u201cAlien\u201d universe, was concerned with such cosmic questions as the origin of life.

( Mark Rogers / Twentieth Century Fox ) \n \n Starring Michael Fassbender, Katherine Waterston, Billy Crudup, Danny McBride, Demian Bichir and Carmen Ejogo. Directed by Ridley Scott. Opens Friday in major theatres. 122 minutes. 18A The cast keeps expanding and the critters keep evolving, but there\u2019s one constant to Ridley Scott\u2019s Alien series. It\u2019s the horrific fear of personal invasion, by something that\u2019s about to leap up and latch onto you, causing unimaginable mayhem. \n \n Article Continued Below \n \n Alien: Covenant has this dread in abundance. It ranks among the better chapters of a sci-fi horror franchise that began with the original Alien in 1979. Scott knows he dropped the ball with Prometheus, the erstwhile Alien prequel he foisted onto the unhappy masses in 2012. It barely showed the infamous beasties, choosing instead to batter senses with windy dialogue and events that seemed to betray basic elements of this decades-long saga. Alien: Covenant brings back the visceral panic that fans expect from the franchise, along with the show-stopping title creatures: among them the face-hugger, the chest-burster and the canoe-headed xenomorph of artist H.R. Giger\u2019s terrifying imagination. They\u2019re waiting to greet the unsuspecting crew of the spaceship Covenant, who have travelled to the far reaches of the galaxy in search of an Earthlike planet to colonize. (The most terrifying thing of all, barely acknowledged, is the thought of what must have happened to Earth if large-scale evacuations are underway.) The Covenant carries 2,000 passengers and 1,140 human embryos, all frozen in cryogenic deep sleep and with an emphasis on preserving couples and families as they make the years-long journey to a planet called Origae-6. Something happens that interrupts the journey and prompts the exploration of an unknown closer planet that looks to be every bit as inviting \u2014 until events prove that theory disastrously wrong. Scott and screenwriters John Logan (Spectre) and Dante Harper tidy up loose ends from Prometheus, making a much better story of the gods vs. men vs. machines ideas that director Scott has being exploring for decades, with Alien and also with Blade Runner. \n \n In so doing, they revive a moribund franchise in much the same way The Force Awakens reignited the Star Wars saga, by reconjuring characters and themes from the past. It won\u2019t take you long to figure out who the \u201cRipley\u201d character is here, for example, and the perilous planet narrative dates right back to the original Alien, and indeed to the dawn of sci-fi moviemaking. \n \n Article Continued Below \n \n This might make the film seem too derivative for some. But for those willing to embrace the retro elements \u2014 count me among them \u2014 it works like gangbusters. And a story like this can\u2019t get by on terror alone. It also needs good actors to put it across, and Alien: Covenant more than delivers on that score. Michael Fassbender reprises his android character David from Prometheus, but this mechanical man acquires deeper intrigue when he\u2019s matched against his factory double, an upgraded model named Walter, also played by Fassbender. This is a grand performance times two that demands to be remembered at awards time. Other standouts from the brilliant cast are Katherine Waterston as fearless scientist Daniels, Danny McBride as good ol\u2019 boy pilot Tennessee and Billy Crudup as tragically promoted second-in-command Christopher, a weak man who assumes authority at exactly the wrong time. (Watch also for cameos from Guy Pearce and James Franco, as they help connect the dots between Prometheus and Alien: Covenant.) Cinematographer Dariusz Wolski and composer Jed Kurzel skilfully combine to boost the film\u2019s fear of the unknown. They make the remote New Zealand shooting locale look and sound both like the verdant paradise the mystery planet is thought to be and the brutal hellhole it actually is. Franchise films very often disappoint, especially as later instalments run out of fresh ideas. Not so Alien: Covenant, which breaks new ground even while revisiting old concepts. It leaves us seriously wondering what will happen next, but I can\u2019t tell you more or you\u2019ll yell \u2014 not only on Earth, but maybe also in space, where no one can hear you scream.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A spaceship arrives on a distant planet that looks like a perfect new home for humans in Alien: Covenant. But if you know anything about Alien movies, you'll know there's only terror in store. Here's what critics are saying about the latest installment of the franchise, with director Ridley Scott of 1979's Alien returning: The filmmakers have finally managed to \"dig the series out of its hole,\" Todd McCarthy puts it at the Hollywood Reporter. He calls Alien: Covenant \"the most satisfying entry in the six-films-and-counting franchise since the first two.\" Beautiful and gripping, it \"feels vital\" and is \"keen to keep us on our toes right up to the concluding scene, which leaves the audience with such a great reveal that it makes you want to see the next installment tomorrow.\" Peter Howell at the Toronto Star agrees this flick \"ranks among the better chapters\" of the franchise. Scott \"breaks new ground even while revisiting old concepts\" and \"brings back the visceral panic that fans expect.\" Actors Katherine Waterston, Danny McBride, Billy Crudup, and Michael Fassbender\u2014who delivers \"a grand performance times two\" as two separate robots\u2014also deserve high praise, he writes. The inclusion of Fassbender's David, from 2012's Prometheus, was an incredibly smart move, writes Joe Morgenstern at the Wall Street Journal. But there was little else that impressed him. There's just \"nothing new\" to this \"gore fest,\" he writes. He acknowledges, however, that \"many Alien fans will come looking for something old, and that's in bloodily abundant supply.\" Chris Klimek had his own issues with the film. For example, \"a religious subtext is introduced and then immediately abandoned,\" he writes at NPR. But he, too, had to marvel at Fassbender, whose \"existential rap session\" provides the \"freshest part of the movie.\" Then again, Fassbender's David \"is the only character in whom Scott seems truly interested,\" he writes.",

He later went house to house in the Ridgewood neighborhood of La Place, shaking hands with residents and hearing their stories. \n \n \"There is enormous faith here, enormous strength here,\" Obama said after his tour. \"You can see it with these families - they were just devastated a few days ago and they are already smiling and laughing and feeling confident about the future and pulling together.\" \n \n Disaster response coordinators who briefed Obama on the recovery effort said that facilitating the return of more than 3,900 evacuees to St. John's Parish and providing them with temporary housing and transportation remains the most urgent challenge. Officials said they were also scrambling to reopen public facilities, like schools and fire stations. \n \n \"Right now we're still in recovery mode. And that means that our biggest priority is helping to house people who have been displaced,\" Obama said. \n \n \"We're also going to make sure at the federal level that we are getting on the case very quickly on figuring out what exactly happened here and making sure it doesn't happen again,\" he added, referring to the failure of a local levee meant to protect the area. \n \n Flooding caused by Isaac was unprecedented and unexpected for St. John's Parish, flowing in quickly from two directions at the height of the storm and cutting off access on Interstate 10. \n \n \"Some of the folks we just walked by literally had to be saved by boat. They were in their homes trapped, the waters came in so quickly. And this is an area that hadn't been flooded in 17 years, so as a consequence folks just weren't anticipating and accustomed to the scale and scope of the destruction,\" Obama said. \"But because of the great work of law enforcement, National Guard, Coast Guard, making sure that folks were out in rescue mode rapidly\u2026 no lives were lost.\" \n \n Obama flew to New Orleans after attending a Labor Day campaign rally in Toledo, Ohio, part of a tour leading to the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., which begins Tuesday. He had planned to continue across the state for a second event in Cleveland, but cut the trip short to head south instead. \n \n The president denied political motivations behind his trip, telling first responders and members of the press that visits to disaster areas are \"not just for photo-ops\" - a point he later underscored in live, televised remarks. \n \n \"When disasters like this happen, we set aside whatever petty disagreements we may have,\" Obama said. \"Nobody's a Democrat or Republican. We're all just Americans looking out for one another.\" \n \n A bipartisan contingent of state and federal leaders accompanied Obama for the visit, including Louisiana Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal, a top surrogate for GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, and FEMA administrator Craig Fugate. Democrats Sen. Mary Landrieu and Rep. Cedric Richmond and Republicans Sen. David Vitter and Rep. Jeff Landry also joined the presidential tour. ||||| 1 of 10. U.S. President Barack Obama (front L) is joined by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal (R) as they tour Hurricane Isaac damage in the Ridgewood neighborhood of LaPlace, Saint John the Baptist Parish in Louisiana, September 3, 2012. \n \n LAPLACE, Louisiana (Reuters) - President Barack Obama toured hurricane-stricken Louisiana on Monday and promised federal recovery help as he sought to show his administration was on top of the disaster response on the eve of his Democrats' national convention in North Carolina. \n \n Obama was preceded by his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, who diverted from the campaign trail to Louisiana on Friday to inspect the fallout from Hurricane Isaac a day after accepting his party's nomination for the November 6 election. \n \n Flying into New Orleans on a hot, sunny day, Obama traveled by motorcade to nearby St. John the Baptist Parish, one of the hardest-hit communities, where he met federal, state and local officials and then surveyed the area. \n \n He saw evidence of the storm's fury - twisted road signs, toppled trees, blown-down fences, debris piled high and pools of water beside the road. Stepping out of his limousine, he paused to comfort a few residents and hear their stories. \n \n \"There has been enormous devastation in St. John's Parish,\" Obama told reporters. He cited similar destruction in other parts of Louisiana as well as neighboring Mississippi and praised emergency officials for limiting the loss of life. \n \n The White House has taken pains to depict Obama as deeply engaged in the government's handling of Isaac and its aftermath. His Republican predecessor, George W. Bush, was heavily criticized for the sluggish federal response to Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005. \n \n Being cast in the role of consoler-in-chief could have political benefits for Obama, who is locked in a tight race with Romney and will accept his party's nomination in a prime-time speech on Thursday night in Charlotte, North Carolina. The convention begins on Tuesday. \n \n \"How y'all doin'?\" Obama asked Trebor Smith, wearing shorts and high rubber boots, outside his storm-damaged house. \n \n \"Better now,\" Smith said. \n \n One woman told Obama the water rose so fast that she and her family had to be rescued by boat. \n \n Isaac was the first hurricane to strike the United States this year, hitting New Orleans almost exactly seven years after Katrina hit, causing an estimated 1,800 deaths. \n \n But Isaac was a much weaker storm. It was blamed for six deaths in Louisiana and two in neighboring Mississippi, and both states suffered from widespread flooding. \n \n ABOUT 125,000 STILL WITHOUT POWER \n \n Even as the fading remnants of Isaac moved east, about 125,000 people remained without power in Louisiana, the governor's office said. With floodwaters not yet receded in some areas, about 2,600 people remained in emergency shelters. Obama has declared disasters in Louisiana and Mississippi. \n \n Isaac's passage through the Gulf of Mexico last week forced cancellation of one day of the Republican convention in Tampa, Florida, and took some attention away from it. \n \n Obama, staying away from the region while emergency officials were occupied with the height of the crisis, waited until Monday for his visit. He went ahead with a Labor Day rally with union workers in Ohio but freed up time in his campaign schedule by scrapping a second event in the battleground state. \n \n Romney, a wealthy former private equities executive who has struggled to show that he can connect with ordinary Americans, detoured to the disaster zone the day after his convention. \n \n Obama, overheard by news photographers allowed in for a few minutes while he was being briefed, said such presidential visits to disaster zones were \"not just for photo-ops.\" \n \n The White House sought to play down any political implications of the two visits at the height of election season, and highlighted the fact that Louisiana's Republican governor, Bobby Jindal, accompanied both of the men. \n \n But White House spokesman Jay Carney, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, echoed Democrats who have pointed out that Romney's running mate, congressional fiscal hawk Paul Ryan, had earlier proposed sharp cuts in disaster relief spending. \n \n \"Our biggest priority is helping to house people who've been displaced ... to make sure they have the kind of support they need to get restarted,\" Obama said on the ground. \n \n Carney's comments did not sit well with the Ryan camp, which expressed outrage that the administration would raise the subject of political differences during a disaster area tour. \n \n \"Apparently there's nothing the President's team won't politicize,\" said Ryan spokesman Brendan Buck. \"Paul Ryan believes providing aid to victims of natural disasters is a critical obligation and should be treated as a high priority within a fiscally responsible budget.\" \n \n Obama made a point of praising the Federal Emergency Management Agency, saying \"in the past we haven't seen the kind of coordination that is necessary.\" FEMA was a focus of criticism for what was seen as the botched response to Katrina in 2005. \n \n Obama also hailed the first successful test of New Orleans' new $14.5 billion flood defenses, a reinforced network of government-built levees. But he said flooding in St. John the Baptist Parish and elsewhere showed the need for further work and pledged federal efforts to find out what went wrong and expedite solutions. \n \n Meantime, oil operations that had been interrupted along the Gulf Coast were coming back on line. The Energy Department said the Exxon Mobil Corp's joint-venture 192,500 barrel per day (bpd) Chalmette, Louisiana, refinery was restarting on Monday. \n \n The department also said Exxon's 502,500 bpd Baton Rouge refinery has returned to normal production after reducing throughput because of Isaac. Only Phillips 66's 247,000 bpd refinery in Alliance, Louisiana, remained shut on Monday due to flooding and power loss from the storm, the agency said. \n \n (Additional reporting by Ian Simpson; Writing by Matt Spetalnick; Editing by Cynthia Osterman and Eric Walsh)",

That's when two men approached with guns and badges and told them to get out and get down, Lochte said. \n \n But Rio's Civil Police Chief Fernando Veloso said the four U.S. swimmers were not robbed. \n \n One or more of the U.S. Olympians vandalized a bathroom at the gas station after they left a party early Sunday. The athletes broke mirrors and damaged other things in the bathroom, police said. \n \n The athletes initially refused to stay, but security asked the taxi not to leave.

(Photo: Kevin Jairaj, USA TODAY Sports) \n \n RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Jimmy Feigen was on his way back to the United States on Friday night after having his passport returned while another one of the U.S. swimmers who returned home has apologized and given a detailed account of the incident at the gas station. \n \n Feigen did not join Gunnar Bentz and Jack Conger when they left Thursday night because he was ordered to donate almost $11,000 to a local sports charity before charges against him would be dropped and he would be allowed to leave. USOC spokesman Patrick Sandusky said Feigen was able to \"secure the release of his passport this evening and is headed home.\" \n \n Rio officials are appealing and want the fine increased to about $50,000. \n \n In a statement released through the University of Georgia, where he's a junior, Bentz said that he \"regretted this situation has drawn attention away from the Olympics, which have been hosted so incredibly well by Brazil and its citizens.\" Though he portrayed Lochte as acting aggressively, his statement also substantiates what Lochte has previously said. \n \n Lochte has said the four swimmers were robbed at gunpoint early Sunday by men impersonating police officers. Lochte said one of the men even pointed a gun to his forehead and robbed the men of their cash. But Rio police said the story was fabricated. \n \n During a news conference Thursday, Fernando Veloso, chief of Rio\u2019s civil police, said the men were drunk and smashed up a gas station bathroom before being confronted by security guards. Veloso said guards flashed a gun to prevent the men from leaving the scene, which ended with the swimmers giving about $55 to pay for the damage. \n \n The International Olympic Committee has opened a disciplinary commission into the four athletes, and they could be sanctioned if wrongdoing is found. \n \n In his statement, Bentz said the four were on their way back to the Olympic village early Sunday when they stopped at a convenience store to use the restroom. When they did not find a restroom inside, they \"foolishly relieved ourselves on the backside of the building behind some bushes,\" Bentz said. They did see a locked door out back, Bentz said, but he did not see anyone break it open. \n \n Video shot Thursday by USA TODAY showed the bathroom mirror and a soap dispenser were undamaged. \n \n While they were in the area, however, Bentz said Lochte pulled down a framed metal ad that had been loosely anchored to the wall. This is similar to what Conger said in his statement to Rio police Thursday. adding that the sign being ripped off \"made a lot of noise.\" \n \n Bentz said he then suggested they leave, and they returned to the taxi.Two men whom Bentz said he believed to be security guards told them to exit the taxi. As Conger and Feigen walked away from the vehicle, Bentz said one of the guards flashed his badge at him and drew his handgun. As Bentz yelled at Conger and Feigen to return, the second guard drew his weapon. \n \n \"Both guards pointed their guns at us and yelled at us to sit on a nearby sidewalk,\" Bentz said. \n \n Lochte got up and began yelling at the guards, Bentz said. Conger and he tried to pull him down to the ground, but Lochte had a \"heated verbal exchange\" with the guards. No physical contact was made, Bentz said. \n \n A bystander who saw the exchange approached the group and offered to translate for the Portuguese-speaking officers. \n \n \u201cThey don\u2019t speak English,\u2019\u2019 Fernando Deluz said in an interview with the website globo.com. \u201cI decided to get involved. The moment that they [the swimmers] tried to flee the security approached them. At first I told them \u2018Slow, slow.\u2019 I told them to be calm, go slow. They sat down. \n \n \u201cOne of them was very terrified. Very terrified.\u201d \n \n Bentz described the group as being \"frightened and confused.\" Through the interpreter, Bentz said one of the guards told them they needed to pay in order to leave. He gave them what was in his wallet, a $20 bill, and Feigen gave them 100 reals. The guards lowered their guns and Bentz said he used hand gestures to ask if it was OK to leave. \n \n \"I went over and I spoke with (the swimmers) and I said, 'OK, that\u2019s OK, bye bye, thank you,\u2019\u201d Deluz told globo.com. \n \n Video of the incident at the station has appeared on multiple media sites. But Bentz said he is \"confident\" some video angles that would substantiate his account have either not been released by Rio authorities or were skipped over. And no footage of the heated exchange between Lochte and the guards has been seen yet. \n \n Bentz's apology follows one from Lochte earlier in the day on social media. The 12-time Olympic medalist said he was sorry for not being \"more careful and candid\" in how he described events Sunday. Though he did not go into details, Lochte said in a Tweet that he and three fellow swimmers faced a \"traumatic\" situation that involved a language barrier and a stranger pointing a gun at them. \n \n He accepted responsibility for his role in \"taking the focus away from the many athletes fulfilling their dreams of participating in the Olympics.\" \n \n \"I should have been much more responsible in how I handled myself and for that am sorry to my teammates, my fans, my fellow competitors, my sponsors, and the hosts of this great event,\" he wrote. \"I am very proud to represent my country in Olympic competition and this was a situation that could and should have been avoided.\" \n \n Lochte said he wanted to wait until their situations were resolved before issuing a statement. He said that the focus of the Games should now turn back to the athletes who are still competing as the Games near their conclusion this weekend. \n \n \"There has already been too much said and too many valuable resources dedicated to what happened last weekend, so I hope we spend our time celebrating the great stories and performance of these Games and look ahead to celebrating future successes,\" he wrote. \n \n A photo posted by Ryanlochte (@ryanlochte) on Aug 19, 2016 at 7:11am PDT \n \n PHOTOS: Every U.S. medal at the Rio Games",

And we were all worried about \u201cThe Lego Movie\u201d before we saw it. So let us be clear that \u201cThe Emoji Movie\u201d is not a soul-crushing disaster simply because its dramatis personae are the range of emotive faces and symbols that live inside your cell phone. \n \n It is a soul-crushing disaster because it lacks humor, wit, ideas, visual style, compelling performances, a point of view or any other distinguishing characteristic that would make it anything but a complete waste of your time, not to mention that of the diligent animators who brought this catastrophe into being. \n \n On a story level, it cobbles together pieces of everything from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d to \u201cSmurfs: The Lost Village\u201d (coincidentally, Sony Pictures Animation\u2019s prior release), and thematically it hits a tediously familiar litany of kid-movie messages: Be yourself. People can be more than one thing. Parents should support their children. Candy Crush is super awesome. \n \n Watch Video: 'The Emoji Movie': First Trailer Reveals Hidden World In Your Smartphone \n \n OK, that last one is a new feature, since the premise of a movie set entirely inside a smartphone has clearly opened up new potentials of product placement, whether its characters are riding boats down the musical streams of Spotify or walking through other people\u2019s photographic memories in Instagram. As with Sony\u2019s \u201cThe Angry Birds Movie,\u201d this is a film that\u2019s shameless about its origins as a pocket doodad; it also resembles that previous film by being completely shrill and stupid. \n \n Within the phone of a hapless high-school freshman named Alex (voiced by Jake T. Austin, \u201cThe Fosters\u201d), an emoji named Gene (T.J. Miller) excitedly prepares for his first day on the job in Textopolis. The \u201cexcitedly\u201d part is a problem, since Gene is supposed to be a jaded \u201cMeh\u201d emoji, but he can\u2019t stop himself from expressing a variety of emotions on his round yellow tennis-ball face. \n \n READ MORE See The Emoji Movie's latest POWER MOVE. PowerRank: 1383 \n \n His professionally underwhelmed parents, played by Steven Wright and Jennifer Coolidge, worry that his propensity for feelings will get him into trouble, and they\u2019re right: when Alex clicks on him, the scanner registers Gene making a weird nonsense face, which infuriates the perpetually-cheery Smiler (Maya Rudolph), whose face bears a constant grinning rictus even when she\u2019s calling for \u201cmalfunction\u201d Gene to be deleted. \n \n Gene\u2019s only hope is to team up with Hi-5 (James Corden) to find Jailbreak (Anna Faris), a hacker who can get them off the phone and into the cloud. Anti-virus bots are eluded and lessons are learned, but to piece together the film\u2019s dreary plotting is to give it more thought than screenwriters Tony Leondis (who also directed), Eric Siegel and a presumably paycheck-collecting Mike White ever did. (And at least one of them will have to live with the fact that he wrote the dreadful pun, \u201cHoly Delete-o!\u201d) \n \n Also Read: Amazon, Annapurna Team Up for Ben Stiller Comedy 'Brad's Status' \n \n The unanswered questions are legion: Why do the emojis fear the phone reboot, when they\u2019ll presumably return in its new iteration? Are they different from their counterparts in millions of other phones? Why does Gene have parents when most Americans are constantly switching to new and upgraded devices? And are we really to believe that teen boy Alex never uses his eggplant emoji? \n \n Emotionally, we\u2019re supposed to care about Gene and Jailbreak getting together, even though they\u2019re so muddily conceived that we know he\u2019s pursuing something dumb and her desires are merely vague. On top of that, we\u2019re also supposed to be rooting for Alex to win the affections of classmate Addie (Tati Gabrielle, \u201cThe 100\u201d), but of course his courtship all boils down to picking the right emoji to text her. Sorry Cyrano de Bergerac and Abelard and Heloise and Cole Porter and anyone else who\u2019s ever used dumb old words to declare love; you\u2019re nothing without a poop symbol. \n \n The one non-dispiriting aspect of the \u201cEmoji Movie\u201d experience was getting to see \u201cPuppy!\u201d, a new animated short set in the world of \u201cHotel Transylvania.\u201d When Adam Sandler outclasses your high-concept, high-tech functions, it\u2019s time to switch to a flip phone. ||||| The Emoji Movie \n \n Looking back, I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and say that there was a small, flickering reason to believe that The Emoji Movie wouldn\u2019t be a complete travesty. After all, the adorably ubiquitous pictograms that have become a second language for at least two generations are a public-domain entity; their relative recent rise makes us forget that, licensing-wise, this is no bigger a grab than Leaves: The Movie would be. It was pretty much free to do whatever it wanted within the ridiculous, cynical parameters it had set. The Emoji Movie had nothing to sell aside from itself. \n \n But this was na\u00efve of me, because The Emoji Movie is selling something. In the mock tradition of countless superior Pixar films before it, it\u2019s attempting to sell a sense of childlike wonder and fascination with an ordinary, everyday object: your smartphone. And in doing so, it is one of the darkest, most dismaying films I have ever seen, much less one ostensibly made for children. \n \n Let me get briefly more philosophical than this film deserves: Emoji remain a ripe source for humor in our everyday digital parlance, specifically because they are devoid of narrative, or even, ironically, emotion. There is a kind of poetry that has emerged from their use; an emoji is worth maybe not a thousand, but certainly a hundred words, and using one in place of words requires you to momentarily, subconsciously imagine that you are living in a language-free totalitarian state where a cry-laugh symbol is our linguistic Soylent. There\u2019s a similar pathetic humor to the constricted movement and expression of Lego figurines, which The Lego Movie exploited to far greater effect. The Emoji Movie\u2019s first aesthetic mistake is redesigning their titular figures to be the same kind of rubber-faced caricatures you can find in any other shrieking CGI kid-distracter on the market. Not once does this film rise above the level of humor of literally any real-world use of a simple upside-down-face emoji (whose meaning I tend to translate as \u201cWheeee, life is a horrible hall of mirrors and I am powerless to do anything but smile about it.\u201d) \n \n If only my review of this film could be an upside-down-face emoji. The laboriously literal plot concerns the \u201cMeh\u201d emoji (T.J. Miller, who certainly doesn\u2019t sound like a man who\u2019s banking his career on this film as his game changer), who is \u201cdefective\u201d due to his ability to express a kaleidoscope of emotions beyond his regimented role. I think this is the basic principle behind the Divergent films; it could just as easily be about a commercial actor in an existential rut. To fix his defect, he teams up with the lowly high-five emoji (James Corden), who has been replaced by the newer, hipper fist-bump emoji in the hall of favorites (racial subtext abounds). Together they escape the messaging app they call home on a dream-logic mission to find a \u201chacker\u201d (Anna Faris) who can take them to the \u201ccloud\u201d and fix Meh\u2019s defect. Along the way, they pass through a series of familiar apps while a battalion of anti-virus bots follows them in lukewarm pursuit. At one point, the film grinds to a halt for a game of Candy Crush. \n \n Yes, the actual IP of The Emoji Movie has nothing to do with the emoji themselves, and everything to do with the apps that have prime placement in the Google AdWords\u2013grade narrative. Somewhat relevant to the plot is the fact that it all takes place on the phone of a 14-year-old boy, who is having text-based girl troubles somehow worsened by Meh\u2019s poor performance as an emoji. Apparently this 14-year-old boy not only has the usual suspects on his phone (Facebook, Instagram, and Spotify all make appearances), but also, mystifyingly, the Crackle app, and extra-mystifyingly, a Just Dance mobile app that I wasn\u2019t even aware existed before now and currently has a two-star rating on the Apple store. \n \n There is a mumbled, shorthand moral about staying true to yourself in all this, but it is drowned out by the wall-to-wall cynicism that is The Emoji Movie\u2019s entire reason for existing in the first place. The film runs through its list of corporate and Zeitgeist awareness obligations in dead-eyed lockstep, making sure to get in uses of the words \u201cslay\u201d and \u201cshade\u201d and lifting an entire section of the lyrics to Rihanna\u2019s \u201cDiamonds\u201d to telegraph a would-be important emotional beat (it\u2019s not a joke, I don\u2019t think). In the end, Meh\u2019s embrace of his animated, multifaceted self just comes off as an ad for an Emoji Movie animated-sticker set that\u2019s probably already out there. \n \n This is a film that seems beamed from a near future in which nothing goes right; \u201cwords,\u201d as the kids in the film agree, \u201caren\u2019t cool\u201d anymore; and Patrick Stewart making jokes about soft shits is the new prestige TV. But what do I know? At my screening, which was for both press and a handful of unfortunate families, at the first sighting of her favorite rainbow-colored icon, a little girl behind me cried out, adoringly, \u201cIt\u2019s Instagram!\u201d A new age of heroes is born. ||||| Tony Leondis' kid-flick tries to turn text-message punctuation into a colorful adventure. \n \n Here's what you tell yourself when you accept an assignment to review a cartoon about emoji: \"Remember what you thought when you heard about The Lego Movie? That it was the most shameless bit of advertising-as-entertainment you could imagine, the nadir of Hollywood's intellectual-property dependence, and couldn't possibly be worth seeing? Remember how incredibly wrong you were?\" \n \n You were wrong then. Given the right combination of inspiration, intelligence and gifted artists, any dumb thing can be turned into an enjoyable film. But Tony Leondis' The Emoji Movie, a very, very dumb thing, comes nowhere near that magic combination. It is fast and colorful enough to attract young kids, but offers nearly nothing to their parents. If only this smartphone-centric dud, so happy to hawk real-world apps to its audience, could have done the same in its release strategy \u2014 coming out via Snapchat, where it would vanish shortly after arrival. But even that wouldn't be fast enough. \n \n The project's first hurdle is imagining how an emoji icon, which by definition represents only one emotional state (or object), can be a character capable of experiencing a story. Its solution is incoherent. We're told both that \"the pressure's always on\" for the face-emoji residents of Textopolis to keep their expressions convincing \u2014 smiley or smirking, angry or puzzled \u2014 and that they have no choice: That weeping guy keeps gushing tears even when he wins the lottery; he's just programmed that way. \n \n The exception is Gene (voiced by T.J. Miller), a youngster preparing to take over for his old man as the face of Meh. (Who could play the elder embodiment of Blah other than Steven Wright?) We learn that free-spirited Gene, thanks to some glitch, is capable of infinite facial expressions. He has a hard time being deadpan on cue. \n \n His first time on the job, in fact, he fails. In the film's weirdly unconvincing vision of how emojis make their way from a phone's inner universe to its screen when the user selects them, the whole process breaks down if one of the actors can't sit still for a face scan. Gene wrecks the app's game show-like stage, and eventually, the program's supervisor (Smiler, a ruthless but always-smiling woman voiced by Maya Rudolph) targets him for deletion, sending a team of mean-looking antivirus bots off to get him. \n \n With the help of a high-five icon (James Corden, taking his position as the story's fount of unrelenting enthusiasm very seriously), Gene sets out to find a hacker who can reprogram him and eliminate unwanted facial expressions. Jailbreak (Anna Faris) says they need to escape the phone entirely to do this, getting past a tricky firewall and out onto The Cloud. \n \n Getting there affords the filmmakers plenty of opportunities for product placement. The characters spend several minutes stuck in Candy Crush (gags about Hi-5's sweet tooth go on about five times longer than they should); they nearly die in a Dance Dance Revolution-style challenge game. At best, these episodes are limp set pieces; at worst, they sound like they were written by ad agencies. When our heroes need to ride streams of music from one place to another, one coos, \"Whoa \u2014 this is Spotify?!\"; when Jailbreak leads Gene into Dropbox, their pursuers can't follow them inside because \"this app is secure.\" \n \n The dialogue is even lamer when the pic's three scribes depict the life of Alex, the high-school kid who owns the phone Gene inhabits. When Alex wonders what to text the girl he has a crush on, his pal scowls \"words aren't cool\" \u2014 in a Manhattan preview where critics were outnumbered by ordinary moviegoers, nearly all of the laughter was directed at this sort of line, where three grown men try and fail to convincingly imagine how kids talk. Hell, they can't even come up with fresh-smelling one-liners about the movie's resident poop icon. (Amusingly, the closing credits identify this slumming actor as \"Sir Patrick Stewart.\") \n \n Leondis and company don't get much mileage out of the vast variety of emojis they might use for sight gags, but they do well enough with the slapstick adventure of Gene's quest from home to the cloud. If not always imaginative or digestible, the look of the settings and characters should keep kids awake for 86 minutes; and if the trick that eventually saves the day makes very little sense to critical moviegoers, at least it's cutely frantic eye candy. Even so, few adults in the theater will have a hard time maintaining the flatline, unimpressed expression Gene has such difficulty with. \n \n Production company: Sony Pictures Animation \n \n Distributor: Columbia \n \n Cast: T.J.

Their impressionable brains simply aren\u2019t set up to sift through the thick haze of corporate subterfuge clouding every scene of this sponsored-content post masquerading as a feature film. Adults know enough to snort derisively when, say, an anthropomorphic high-five drops a reference to popular smartphone game Just Dance Now (available for purchase in the App Store, kids!), but young children especially are more innocent and more vulnerable. \n \n The Emoji Movie is a force of insidious evil, a film that feels as if it was dashed off by an uninspired advertising executive. The best commercials have a way of making you forget you\u2019re being pitched at, but director Tony Leondis leaves all the notes received from his brand partners in full view. The core conceit apes Tim Burton\u2019s The Nightmare Before Christmas, where a spirited misfit hops between self-contained worlds styled in a single recognisable way. Instead of holidays, however, our hero here jumps from app to app, and the ulterior motive of pumping up download numbers drains every last drop of joy from Leondis\u2019s efforts to enchant. \n \n The director wants us to think of Textopolis, the bustling city inside our smartphones, as a world of pure imagination. When a meh-face emoji named Gene (TJ Miller) is banished from his home for daring to express an emotion other than unimpressed nonchalance, Leondis takes his odyssey of self-discovery as an opportunity to imagine fantastical scenery. As a smiley-face emoji (Maya Rudolph) ruling Textopolis with a cheery iron fist tirelessly hunts him down, Gene gapes in awe at such marvels as a supercharged rollercoaster ride through raw data and a pixelated humpback whale that majestically glides over him. But because these glossy images are so nakedly in service of plugs for Dropbox and Spotify, it\u2019s all but impossible to appreciate any incidental beauty they might possess. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Alex, voiced by Jake T Austin, in The Emoji Movie. Photograph: Sony Pictures/AP \n \n The pervasive falseness extends to the film\u2019s thematic underpinnings, which make a clumsy lunge at vague, be-yourself positivity. The paramount importance of being true to one\u2019s own spirit is made literal in Gene\u2019s silly quandary; he\u2019s forced to hide who he is for the sake of compulsory homogeneity, and only through tapping into his full range of emotions can he achieve his potential. While Leondis, who is gay, has stated he intends this as an allegory for the tribulations faced by the non-heterosexual community, any social commentary is stymied by the execution. The film\u2019s insistent feel-goodery and occasional nods to feminism (delivered by a spunky blue-haired hacker emoji, voiced by Anna Faris) ring false. Product-placement mashups Toy Story and The Lego Movie had the purity of playtime to seal in the sentimentality; somehow it\u2019s not as endearing in a film built around the apps we use to kill time while sat on the toilet. \n \n The ruthless mercenary details take the Emoji Movie beyond simply embarrassing and incompetent into something more manipulative and contemptible. One perplexing scene finds the emoji pals all doing a synchronised dance called \u201cthe emoji bop\u201d. In a film so desperate to sell itself, this is clearly a craven bid to go viral, the cinematic equivalent of clickbait. The script practically begs for the approval of the tweens that elevated the lowly emoji to phenomenon status, but has only the slightest notion how they talk or act. Alex (Jake T Austin), the human in possession of the phone housing Gene and the rest of the cast, speaks like an dusty oldster. Alex\u2019s awkward courtship of the cute girl in his class revolves around the deployment of emojis, but demonstrates no workable understanding of how the icons fit into adolescent life. Watching this fogeyish hero angle for edgy relevance is as uncomfortable as reading a fast-food chain\u2019s Twitter account. \n \n However, the most disturbing part of this toxic film is the way it infects audiences with its ugly cynicism. A viewer leaves The Emoji Movie a colder person, not only angry at the film for being unconscionably bad, but resentful of it for making them feel angry. A critic can accept the truth that art and commerce will spend eternity locked in opposition. Nevertheless it\u2019s still startling to see art that cheers commerce on while being stamped in the face by its boots. ||||| This animated comedy takes place in Textopolis, a world inside a smartphone that's inhabited by various emojis. There, an emoji named Gene (voiced by T.J. Miller) is ashamed that he has multiple facial expressions while his colleagues only have one each, and he embarks on a quest to be like everyone else. James Corden, Anna Faris, Jennifer Coolidge, Patrick Stewart, and Maya Rudolph also lend their voices to this film from Sony Pictures Animation.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 With a 3% \"fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, reviews of The Emoji Movie could have consisted of repeated strings of the vomiting emoji, thumbs-down emoji, and poop emoji. Fortunately for fans of brutal critical drubbings, film critics had to use words (despite the film's position that \"words aren't cool\"). Here are some of the best takedowns of the new animated film: \"Children should not be allowed to watch The Emoji Movie,\" writes Charles Bramesco at the Guardian, calling it a \"sponsored-content post masquerading as a feature film\" and a \"force of insidious evil.\" It somehow exists to get kids to buy apps without apparently understanding kids and how they actually use emojis. \"A viewer leaves The Emoji Movie a colder person,\" the reviewer concludes. \"Hear that? It's the end of the world,\" writes Johnny Oleksinsk at ithe New York Post after calling The Emoji Movie a \"new exercise in soulless branding.\" At Vulture, Emily Yoshida calls it \"one of the darkest, most dismaying films I have ever seen, much less one ostensibly made for children.\" The Emoji Movie is \"a very, very dumb thing\" full of moments that \"sound like they were written by ad agencies,\" according to the Hollywood Reporter, which laments that the film wasn't released \"via Snapchat, where it would vanish shortly after arrival. But even that wouldn't be fast enough.\" Finally, Alonso Duralde at the Wrap calls it a \"soul-crushing disaster\" and \"completely shrill and stupid.\" This \"complete waste of your time\" is without \"humor, wit, ideas, visual style, compelling performances, a point of view, or any other distinguishing characteristic.\"",
    "generated_summary": "\"The Emoji Movie\" is not a soul-crushing disaster simply because its dramatis personae are the range of emotive faces and symbols that live inside your cell phone. On a story level, it cobbles together pieces of everything from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d to \u201cSmurfs: The Lost Village\u201d The unanswered questions are legion: Why do the emojis fear the phone reboot, when they\u2019ll presumably return in its new iteration? Are they different from their counterparts in millions of other phones? Why does Gene have parents when most Americans are constantly switching devices and upgraded devices?",

Security Council to impose its \"hostile policy\" against Pyongyang. \n \n North Korea is facing further United Nations sanctions for its underground nuclear test explosion two weeks ago, its biggest and most powerful to date which drew warnings from Washington and international condemnation. \n \n In December it launched a long-range rocket in a move that critics said was designed to test technology for an intercontinental ballistic missile, leading to tighter U.N. sanctions being imposed last month. \n \n \"The U.S. is to blame for the situation on the Korean peninsula which is inching close to an unpredictable phase now,\" So Se Pyong, North Korea's ambassador in Geneva, told the U.N.-sponsored Conference on Disarmament. \n \n A week ago, North Korea's delegation threatened South Korea with \"final destruction\" during a heated debate at the talks, the main U.N. disarmament negotiating forum. \n \n U.S. ambassador Laura Kennedy did not respond to the verbal assault on Wednesday. \n \n But South Korea's disarmament ambassador Kwon Haeryong took the floor to urge its isolated neighbor to \"abandon its nuclear ambitions without delay and embark on the path to peace\". \n \n \"North Korea's nuclear test is a challenge to the peace and security of the Korean peninsula and northeast Asia and beyond. There should be no mistake that the biggest victim will be none other than North Korea itself,\" Kwon said. \n \n PANDORA'S BOX \n \n So, a former ambassador to Iran, retorted: \"I'd like to give you objective advice that it will be much better for South Korea to keep quiet, pay more attention to your own concerns of internal affairs and demonstrate at least a little patience instead of making troubles and opening Pandora's boxes\". \n \n North and South Korea are technically still at war after their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. \n \n So said he wanted to draw attention to the \"intensified U.S. hostile policy\" toward the Democratic People's Republic of Korea which has a right to launch satellites for peaceful purposes. \n \n \"The U.S. should no longer be allowed to seriously infringe upon the independent right of the DPRK to use space for peaceful purposes nor should it be allowed to abuse the U.N. Security Council as a tool for executing its hostile policy toward the DPRK,\" he declared. \n \n The United States has launched the most military satellites and nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missiles in the world, he said, making it \"the biggest threat to world peace\". \n \n North Korea's latest nuclear test, its third since 2006, had been a resolute step in self-defense, So said. \n \n \"The third nuclear test was carried out as part of the practical countermeasures for defending the country's sovereignty and security to cope with ruthless hostile behaviors of the U.S., which wantonly infringed upon the DPRK's legitimate right to satellite launch for peaceful purposes.\" \n \n Ireland's foreign minister Eamon Gilmore said that North Korea, by defying U.N. resolutions, shunning its obligations under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), and refusing to cooperate with the IAEA nuclear watchdog, \"only isolates itself further from the international community\". \n \n In a speech at the forum, he called on North Korea to cease immediately nuclear testing and ballistic missile activities and re-engage in stalled six-party talks on denuclearization. \n \n The talks involving the two Koreas, the United States, Japan and Russia are aimed at curbing Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions. \n \n (Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay; Editing by Jon Hemming) ||||| North Korea says its nuclear weapons can reach the U.S. \n \n By Agence France-Presse \n \n Wednesday, February 27, 2013 5:35 EDT \n \n North Korea warned Wednesday that the US mainland was \u201cwell within\u201d the range of its nuclear weapons, as Pyongyang continued to ramp up the bellicose rhetoric after its recent nuclear test. \n \n In an article posted on the official Uriminzokkiri website, a member of the Korean National Peace Committee \u2014 a propaganda body \u2014 said the North was now a \u201cfully-independent rocket and nuclear weapons state\u201d. \n \n \u201cThe United States should be acutely aware that the US mainland is now well within the range of our strategic rockets and nuclear weapons,\u201d the signed commentary said. \n \n North Korea made a similar claim in October last year, saying it possessed rockets capable of striking the continental United States. \n \n That was largely dismissed as bluster, but that was before Pyongyang conducted a successful long-range rocket launch in December, followed by its third nuclear test on February 12. \n \n Although most experts believe the North has a long way to go to developing a dependable inter-continental ballistic missile, the December launch was a strong step in the right direction. \n \n And this month\u2019s nuclear test also fuelled concerns that North Korea is refining the technical ability to place a miniaturised nuclear warhead on a long-range missile. \n \n After analysing debris from the rocket launch in December, the South Korean military estimated its possible range at around 10,000 kilometres (6,200 miles), bringing in the west coast of the United States. \n \n In a separate commentary Wednesday, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) slammed upcoming US-South joint military drills, and warned that the Korean peninsula was \u201can inch away from explosion\u201d.",

    "document": "The experience always impresses two things on Canada\u2019s former ambassador to Iran. \n \n NEW YORK\u2014It hasn\u2019t been unusual over the last 20 years, when Ken Taylor returns to his home in New York from abroad, for a U.S. customs inspector to look at his passport, glance up, back at the photo and name, and say, \u201cHey, I studied you in high school!\u201d \n \n That\u2019s why Taylor is, understandably, a little touchy about the new Ben Affleck movie Argo to be released this week, in which Canada\u2019s role all but vanishes while the CIA and one of its agents, played by Affleck, become stars of the show. \n \n It\u2019s a place well earned by Taylor and his colleagues at the Canadian Embassy in Tehran \u2014 who put their lives on the line to harbour the half-dozen diplomats who slipped away from the U.S. Embassy as it was besieged by Iranian militants who took more than 60 Americans hostage and held most under harsh conditions for more than a year. \n \n One, even for celebrated international heroes, time passes. And two, that for his role in rescuing six U.S. diplomats in 1980 after the tumultuous days of Ayatollah Khomeini\u2019s Islamic revolution, he has a place in history. \n \n \u201cYou cannot go around New York without seeing this. It\u2019s on buses. It\u2019s on a three-storey building in Soho. They\u2019re spending a lot of money. They\u2019re banking on an Academy Award.\u201d \n \n And the movie, he said, is a big deal. \n \n For them, he said, the movie will probably \u201cbe the story.\u201d \n \n But, as he told the Star at his Upper East Side apartment building in Manhattan, he also knows that for those under age 45 or so, the hostage-takings of 1979, and Canada\u2019s courageous support for its neighbour, \u201cis a part of history that they may only vaguely remember.\u201d \n \n Taylor, still fit, fashionable and unflappable at 77, understands full well that Argo is Hollywood, not history. \n \n \u201cThe movie\u2019s fun, it\u2019s thrilling, it\u2019s pertinent, it\u2019s timely,\u201d he said. \u201cBut look, Canada was not merely standing around watching events take place. The CIA was a junior partner.\u201d \n \n That\u2019s why Taylor is happy \u2014 and he\u2019s still sufficiently famous to be getting media calls from all over the world \u2014 to politely \u201coffer some interpretation of what went on in reality, rather than in Hollywood play time.\u201d \n \n Not only was that analysis demonstrably true, the period was hardly one of glory for U.S. intelligence and military operations. The CIA was blind to rising threats to the Shah\u2019s regime in Iran. And the so-called \u201cEagle Claw\u201d rescue operation aimed at freeing the remaining hostages in April 1980 ended in flaming fiasco in the Iranian desert with the death of eight American commandos. \n \n In buffing up America\u2019s \u201ctarnished\u201d image from the time, Argo tries to do what the CIA agent, Antonio Mendez, accused Iranian extremists of in his book on which the movie is based. \n \n \u201cMuch like actors in a Hollywood movie,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe militants saw themselves as the heroes and expected the whole world to see them as such.\u201d \n \n On Nov. 4, 1979, outraged that the despised Shah had been admitted to the United States for medical care after fleeing the country, thousands of Iranians stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. \n \n Sixty hostages were seized in the embassy. Three were confined at the Foreign Ministry. (Thirteen women and black hostages were later released on the grounds they represented the oppressed of America.) \n \n But a handful had slipped away, out of the U.S. consular office into the rainy streets of Tehran. Most were quickly captured by the Revolutionary Guard. Six weren\u2019t. \n \n Of these, five were taken in a few days later as soon as they called Canadian consular official John Sheardown for help. A sixth, who hid out for weeks with a Swedish diplomat, joined his countrymen a few weeks later. \n \n The Canadian response was as unhesitating as it was high-risk. \n \n For three months, it was Taylor and his colleagues who housed the six Americans, who moved them around Tehran when the need arose, who tried to boost spirits, who visited and smuggled the odd banned libation to the three Americans confined to the Foreign Ministry, who fought for the release of all the hostages, and \u2014 in Taylor\u2019s case \u2014 collected intelligence for Washington on possible rescue operations. \n \n Canadians shared the emotional ups and downs of the Americans, their boredom, their anxiety, the constant simmering fear of a leak through the Iranian staff at their houses or discovery if someone was spotted through a window. \n \n Though long gone from the Canadian foreign service, Taylor retains the delightfully droll understatement of the diplomat. \n \n \u201cWhat would have happened if one way or another it would have gone awry? . . . I may have had to stay around awhile\u201d in Iran. \n \n Had his intelligence-gathering for Washington been discovered, \u201cthat would have been a difficult consequence, I think.\u201d \n \n It\u2019s not for nothing the movie is set mostly in Washington and Hollywood and only fleetingly in Tehran, Taylor notes. Neither Mendez nor any other Americans under the tormented administration of President Jimmy Carter had much of a clue what was going on in Iran. \n \n When Taylor heard a few years ago that Mendez had sold movie rights to his book (which, to be fair, is much more generous than the movie about Canada\u2019s role), \u201cI said, \u2018Well, that\u2019s going to be interesting.\u2019 \n \n \u201cBut how do they know what\u2019s going on, because Tony Mendez was only there for a day and a half? The six diplomats were in (Canadian safekeeping) for three months, and they had no idea what was going on outside.\u201d \n \n Some of Taylor\u2019s friends tried to convey to the film-maker that there was \u201canother side to this other than Tony Mendez\u2019s book, since he was in Washington and Hollywood, he had no idea what was going on in Tehran.\u201d \n \n Eventually, Taylor\u2019s wife, Pat, did receive a call from Page Leong, the actress who plays her. \n \n \u201cShe had a long talk with Pat and Pat went over what happened,\u201d Taylor laughs. \u201cAnd then Page says, \u2018Well, you know this is a thriller?\u2019 What you\u2019re saying isn\u2019t necessarily going to be in the movie.\u201d \n \n How right she was. \n \n When the movie was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival, the former ambassador wasn\u2019t invited, even though he was in Toronto at the time. \n \n Friends who saw the opening were outraged on Taylor\u2019s behalf, however, at how much history had been sacrificed to thrill. And after the Star\u2019s Martin Knelman reported on this, Taylor was deluged with international attention. \n \n Soon, Affleck phoned, Taylor recounts, and said, \u201c \u2018You\u2019ve got issues?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019ve got issues.\u2019 \u201d \n \n So Affleck invited Taylor and his wife to Los Angeles, screened the movie, and offered \u2014 \u201calthough it\u2019s going to cost money\u201d \u2014 to cut the postscript and let Taylor \u201cwrite what you want.\u201d \n \n The new postscript says: \u201cThe involvement of the CIA complemented efforts of the Canadian Embassy to free the six held in Tehran. To this day the story stands as an enduring model of international co-operation between governments.\u201d \n \n Even that hardly does Canada justice. \n \n Although the short-lived federal government of Joe Clark was fully supportive and deeply involved, in Argo\u2019s version Canada was not much more a factor than Iceland. \n \n Another Canadian hero who gets short shrift is John Sheardown, the first Canadian official the Americans approached for shelter. \n \n \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call me before?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d \n \n Sheardown, now in his late 80s and suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and his wife, Zena, took in four of the Americans \u2014 at considerable risk to Zena who wasn\u2019t a Canadian citizen and had no diplomatic immunity. \n \n \u201cTo make the movie work, I guess, they assumed that everybody was with Pat and me,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cAnd John and Zena did yeoman work.\u201d \n \n For Mendez\u2019s part, he didn\u2019t even learn of the six hostages until weeks after their escape. The CIA agent had his idea for the Hollywood angle in January. Then he arranged a back story to portray them as Canadian film-makers, created some disguises and documents. \n \n \u201cBut for every moment in Washington,\u201d Taylor recalls, \u201cthere was an equal moment in Ottawa. \n \n \u201cAll the documentation to authenticate the diplomats as Canadians, the business cards, credit cards, the passports, the academic credentials, everything came out of Canada.\u201d \n \n Not only that, Canada had already devised \u201cexit strategies\u201d \u2014 which didn\u2019t use a Hollywood angle Mendez had dreamed up \u2014 that Taylor believes \u201cwe could have pulled off.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe thought the (Mendez) plan was OK,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t think we really needed something that intricate.\u201d \n \n The key was that the Americans were travelling as Canadians. Whether they were purported to be petroleum engineers, nutritionists, agronomists \u2014 instead of film-makers \u2014 probably didn\u2019t much matter, he said. \n \n In Tehran, moreover, Mendez \u201cwas totally in our hands,\u201d Taylor said. His involvement over his weekend in Tehran was \u201cnot much . . . just some visa stamps. Ottawa had provided everything else.\u201d \n \n In fact, the CIA almost scuppered the plan by making passport notations that used the wrong Iranian calendar and would have essentially had the Americans leaving the country before they arrived. \n \n Canadian official Roger Lucy, who spoke Farsi, spotted the error. Otherwise, Taylor said, \u201cthat would have been game over.\u201d \n \n On the departure date, Taylor arranged embassy cars to pick everyone up \u2014 Mendez from his hotel, the diplomats from the Canadian residences \u2014 in pre-dawn Tehran. \n \n He ensured the flight got off before leaving Iran himself forever with the last of the Canadian embassy staff. \n \n As for Argo\u2019s car chase and Mendez/Affleck\u2019s various on-screen heroics, \u201cit makes a great movie,\u201d said Taylor, who was played in an earlier movie on the Khomeini revolution by Gordon Pinsent and is this time portrayed by Victor Garber. \n \n If Argo has a useful message, he said, it is on the importance and need for diplomacy and the fact that \u201cwhat happened 32 years ago could happen tomorrow.\u201d \n \n For Taylor, his life changed utterly after his exploits in Tehran. He left the foreign service, spent four years as Canada\u2019s consul-general in New York, and has since enjoyed a successful career in the private sector. \n \n \u201cIt became a different life entirely,\u201d he said. But not so much that the past isn\u2019t these days ringing his phone off the hook. \n \n Recently, he was called by the BBC World Service for Tehran to comment on the closure of the Canadian embassy in Iran and on Argo. \n \n They told him \u201cthey still remember you in Iran,\u201d he said. \n \n And they wanted to know whether Canada had closed its embassy in Tehran to \u201ccoincide with the showing of the movie in Toronto. \n \n \u201cI said, \u2018Well, I doubt it.\u2019 \u201d \n \n Whatever goes on in Hollywood, life goes on, and rather sweetly, for Ken Taylor, who will travel to Washington this week for a screening of Argo at the Canadian Embassy. \n \n The other morning, the phone rang once more in his 26th-floor apartment overlooking the East River. \n \n It was the BBC World Service calling back to inform him they owed him \u00a340 for the interview. \n \n He told them it was very thoughtful, but not to bother. ||||| Please consider disabling it for our site, or supporting our work in one of these ways \n \n Ken Taylor, the Canadian diplomat who sheltered six Americans in Tehran during the Iranian hostage crisis and clandestinely aided their flight from the country, died Thursday in New York City. He was 81. \u201cAs Canada\u2019s ambassador to Iran during the Iranian Revolution, Taylor valiantly risked his own life by shielding a group of American diplomats from capture,\u201d Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in a statement. \u201cKen Taylor represented the very best that Canada\u2019s foreign service has to offer.\u201d Except for those three months in winter of 1979, Taylor\u2019s public career evinced little of the drama that would characterize one of the most famous moments in Canadian diplomatic history. He worked in Canada\u2019s industry ministry and specialized in foreign trade commissions before Pierre Trudeau elevated him to the diplomatic corps. An initial New York Times description of Taylor after the escape from Iran perfunctorily described him as a diplomat \u201cwhose career has been spent primarily in furthering his country\u2019s commercial interests.\u201d \n \n That changed on November 8, 1979, when John Sheardown, a Canadian consular official, telephoned Taylor and informed him that five Americans had escaped from the U.S. embassy in Tehran after it was stormed four days earlier, and that they were in hiding in Sheardown\u2019s house. (Sheardown died in 2013.) Taylor moved two of them to his own residence, where they were joined by another American who had found temporary refuge among Swedish diplomats. In the tumult that followed the Iranian Revolution, the U.S. and Canadian governments feared what would happen if the six Americans and their Canadian protecters were discovered. Taylor and his remaining staff, in coordination with Canadian Prime Minister Joe Clark and the U.S. State Department, orchestrated the six Americans\u2019 escape from Iran. Every possible avenue of escape posed its own risks, as Taylor explained to The New York Times in 1981. At first, Canadian officials in Teheran considered driving the four men and two women to Tabriz, in the northeast, and over the border to Turkey. But Mr. Taylor said that Tabriz was \u201cup in arms with local revolts and once they left our residences we would lose control.\u201d Next, a dash for a Persian Gulf port and a friendly tanker was considered. But Teheran was lawless, he said, \u201cto say nothing of the countryside.\u201d Moreover, this move would have meant traveling through Khuzistan, the Arab-populated province that was in turmoil and later became the focus of the war with Iraq. \u201cWe couldn't say goodbye to our house guests with any degree of confidence on that route,\u201d Mr. Taylor said. \u201cSo we decided to confront the Iranians head on,\u201d he added, and fly out the six Americans directly from the Teheran airport. Taylor gave Canadian passports to the Americans so they could pass through customs, while the CIA forged exit visas and sent an agent, Tony Mendez, to aid their flight. As the Americans left, Taylor also evacuated the few remaining Canadian personnel and closed the embassy on January 28. The six Americans\u2019 safety was originally kept secret by both governments for fear of retribution toward the hostages. ||||| By the 1970s, many Iranians were fed up with the Shah\u2019s government. In protest, they turned to the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, a radical cleric whose revolutionary Islamist movement seemed to promise a break from the past and a turn toward greater autonomy for the Iranian people. In July 1979, the revolutionaries forced the Shah to disband his government and flee to Egypt. The Ayatollah installed a militant Islamist government in its place. \n \n The United States, fearful of stirring up hostilities in the Middle East, did not come to the defense of its old ally. (For one thing, President Carter, aware of the Shah\u2019s terrible record in that department, was reluctant to defend him.) However, in October 1979 President Carter agreed to allow the exiled leader to enter the U.S. for treatment of an advanced malignant lymphoma. His decision was humanitarian, not political; nevertheless, as one American later noted, it was like throwing \u201ca burning branch into a bucket of kerosene.\ufffd? Anti-American sentiment in Iran exploded. \n \n On November 4, just after the Shah arrived in New York, a group of pro-Ayatollah students smashed the gates and scaled the walls of the American embassy in Tehran. Once inside, they seized 66 hostages, mostly diplomats and embassy employees. After a short period of time, 13 of these hostages were released. (For the most part, these 13 were women, African-Americans and citizens of countries other than the U.S.\u2013people who, Khomeini argued, were already subject to \u201cthe oppression of American society.\ufffd?) Some time later, a 14th hostage developed health problems and was likewise sent home. By midsummer 1980, 52 hostages remained in the embassy compound. \n \n Diplomatic maneuvers had no discernible effect on the Ayatollah\u2019s anti-American stance; neither did economic sanctions such as the seizure of Iranian assets in the United States. Meanwhile, while the hostages were never seriously injured, they were subjected to a rich variety of demeaning and terrifying treatment. They were blindfolded and paraded in front of TV cameras and jeering crowds. They were not allowed to speak or read, and they were rarely permitted to change clothes. Throughout the crisis there was a frightening uncertainty about their fate: The hostages never knew whether they were going to be tortured, murdered or set free. ||||| The Canadian plan that allowed six American diplomats to escape the takeover of the American Embassy in Teheran was produced after six weeks of coded telex messages between Teheran, Ottawa and Washington. \n \n ''By mid-November I was convinced we were certainly going to have to look for an exit,'' said Kenneth D. Taylor, the Canadian Ambassador who gave the six sanctuary and who is now Consul General in New York. That conviction came to him 10 days afer the United States compound was seized. \n \n ''I didn't envisage that it would take 14 months before they were all free,'' Mr. Taylor said in his office yesterday. ''But it did seem to be an endless affair.'' \n \n Mr. Taylor began planning the best exit route on the telex to the Department of External Affairs in Ottawa. That ministry, in turn, discussed the plans with the State Department. Two Escape Routes Ruled Out \n \n At first, Canadian officials in Teheran considered driving the four men and two women to Tabriz, in the northeast, and over the border to Turkey. But Mr. Taylor said that Tabriz was ''up in arms with local revolts and once they left our residences we would lose control.'' \n \n Next, a dash for a Persian Gulf port and a friendly tanker was considered. But Teheran was lawless, he said, ''to say nothing of the countryside.'' Moreover, this move would have meant traveling through Khuzistan, the Arab-populated province that was in turmoil and later became the focus of the war with Iraq. ''We couldn't say goodbye to our house guests with any degree of confidence on that route,'' Mr. Taylor said. \n \n ''So we decided to confront the Iranians head on,'' he added, and fly out the six Americans directly from the Teheran airport. By early January the Canadian Cabinet had agreed to issue the Americans with Canadian passports. Mr. Taylor will not say who did it, but entry visas were then affixed to the documents. Consternation Over Visa \n \n When the passports arrived through the diplomatic pouch in Teheran, however, there was consternation at the embassy. One of Mr. Taylor's Persian-speaking aides, Roger Lucey, saw that the visa makers had followed the calendar used under the Shah and not the traditional Islamic calendar brought back by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. The visas would have had the Americans leaving before they had arrived. \n \n ''We might have argued it out with immigration,'' Mr. Taylor said, ''and told them, 'Don't blame us for your administrative foulup.' '' Instead, he said, ''we fixed it up,'' but he will not say how this was accomplished. By Jan. 28, with the embassy staff gradually reduced to half a dozen, the six Americans were ready to go. Mr. Taylor posted two aides at the Teheran airport to keep an eye on things and to telephone him at his residence. \n \n He was worried. ''After three months with us,'' he said, ''the six were healthy but their degree of resiliency, their ability to respond to the unexpected was limited.'' \n \n The Americans passed through five checkpoints without difficulty. ''There was a bad moment at the next,'' Mr. Taylor said. The official there insisted on taking the passports to a private room and reading them carefully. He found nothing, however, and the Americans boarded a Swissair flight to Zurich. \n \n Another bad moment came when the plane was held up because of ''mechanical difficulties.'' ''We were prepared for that,'' Mr. Taylor said. All six had tickets on other planes, and a four-bedroom house had been rented in case the Americans had to return to Teheran. \n \n Twenty minutes later, however, the ''technical difficulty'' was fixed and the plane took off for Zurich.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Ken Taylor, the Canadian ambassador to Iran who helped smuggle six American hostages home from the country in 1980, died Thursday of colon cancer at the age of 81, his wife tells the AP. For three months, Taylor and his deputy, John Sheardown, hid at their Tehran homes the six US hostages who escaped from the American Embassy after it was overrun by Iranian student radicals on Nov. 4, 1979. Along with the CIA, Taylor helped arrange the hostages' escape by procuring plane tickets and fake Canadian passports. It was an incredibly risky operation that included passport foul-ups and a suspicious airport official, but the six hostages flew to safety from Tehran's airport on Jan. 28, 1980, the New York Times reported. Taylor's Iran exploits were chronicled both in the 2013 documentary Our Man in Tehran and in Ben Affleck's Oscar-winning Argo, though critics complained of the latter movie's inaccuracies, saying it minimized the Canadians' role in the rescue and gave most of the credit to the CIA. \"Canada was not merely standing around watching events take place,\" Taylor told the Toronto Star in 2012. \"The CIA was a junior partner.\" (Affleck later apologized and reworked the closing credits that mentioned Taylor's role, the Atlantic notes.) Meanwhile, Taylor's wife of 50 years, Pat, remembers one of her husband's most notable traits: his generous spirit. \"He did all sorts of things for everyone without any expectation of something coming back,\" she tells the AP. \"It's why that incident in Iran happened. There was no second thought about it.\"",
