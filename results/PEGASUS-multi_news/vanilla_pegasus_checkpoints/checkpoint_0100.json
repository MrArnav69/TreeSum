Three Republican governors, including Rick Scott of Florida and Scott Walker of Wisconsin, rejected a share of the money citing debt and deficit concerns. \n \n \"A [Mitt] Romney victory would dramatically empower Republican governors,\" Kousser says. \n \n State-By-State View \n \n North Carolina: One-term incumbent Democratic Gov. Beverly Perdue, the first woman to hold the state's top office, announced in January that she would not seek re-election after polls showed her with high disapproval ratings and trailing Republican candidate Pat McCrory. \n \n The seat is expected to be won by McCrory, a former Charlotte mayor, who is facing Perdue's lieutenant governor, Walter Dalton. McCrory lost a close race to Perdue in 2008, when then-presidential candidate Barack Obama became the first Democrat to win North Carolina in more than three decades. The Real Clear Politics average for the race has McCrory maintaining a 14.3 percentage point lead. \n \n Montana: Popular Democratic Gov. Brian Schweitzer \u2014 he won his last election with 65 percent of the vote \u2014 has reached his two-term limit. The state's Democratic Attorney General Steve Bullock is trying to keep the seat in his party's column by associating himself with Schweitzer's legacy. He's in a tough race with former two-term GOP Rep. Rick Hill. \n \n New Hampshire: Former Democratic state Sen. Maggie Hassan has also promised a continuation of the policies of her predecessor, retiring Democratic Gov. John Lynch. Her opponent is lawyer Ovide Lamontagne, a Tea Party conservative who ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1996 and for the U.S. Senate in 2010. The national parties have invested in the campaigns, which have focused on fiscal and women's health care issues. \n \n Washington: The state's governorship has been in Democratic hands for 32 years, and former U.S. Rep. Jay Inslee is in a dead-heat battle to keep it that way. His opponent is the state's Republican Attorney General Rob McKenna. McKenna has a proven ability to win statewide, but working in Inslee's favor are Obama's poll numbers. The Real Clear Politics average shows Obama with an average 13.6 percentage point lead over Romney; Inslee is leading McKenna by an average of 1 percentage point. \n \n Pretty Much Sure Things \n \n Republican Govs. Jack Dalrymple in North Dakota and Gary Herbert in Utah, and GOP Rep. Mike Pence in Indiana are expected to win. So are Democratic Govs. Peter Shumlin in Vermont and Jack Markell in Delaware. \n \n Democrats are also hoping to hold on to the governorship in Missouri, where Jay Nixon is running for a second term against Republican Dave Spence; and in West Virginia, where Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin, former state senate president, is running for his first full term after winning a special election in 2011. GOP businessman Bill Maloney is his opponent, as he was last year. \n \n Nixon has been consistently outpolling Spence by an average of about 7 points in Missouri.

    "document": "\n \n \n \n UPDATE: 4/19/2001 Read Richard Metzger: How I, a married, middle-aged man, became an accidental spokesperson for gay rights overnight on Boing Boing \n \n It\u2019s time to clarify a few details about the controversial \u201cHey Facebook what\u2019s SO wrong with a pic of two men kissing?\u201d story, as it now beginning to be reported in the mainstream media, and not always correctly. \n \n First of all, with regards to the picture: \n \n The photo which was used to illustrate my first post about the John Snow Kiss-In is a promotional still from the British soap opera \u201cEastenders.\u201d It features one of the main characters from the show (Christian Clarke, played by the actor John Partridge- left) and someone else who I don\u2019t know. I am not a regular viewer so I can\u2019t say if the man on the right is an extra or an actual character. \n \n This picture has itself caused scandal in the UK, as it was a gay kiss that was broadcast before the watershed, and as such led to a number of complaints to the BBC. However, since this episode aired (October 2008) Christian now has a boyfriend and a few more gay kisses have taken place. \n \n In relation to the John Snow Kiss-In event, I used this particular photo because I considered it to be quite mild (no groping, no tongues). The photos I had considered using before I chose that one are much more racy. Oh the irony! \n \n Secondly, the removal of the Facebook John Snow Kiss-In event: \n \n It turns out that the Facebook event for the John Snow Kiss-In was not blocked by Facebook, but made private by the creator of the event itself. Paul Shetler, the organizer, left this comment on the previous thread: \n \n \u201cHey I just saw this. Before it goes too far, I just want people to know that FB have NOT removed the kiss-in event page; it\u2019s still there, but _I made the event private after the event_ was over and only visible to those who had been invited as there were starting to be trolls posting abusive nonsense on it.\u201d \n \n Thanks for clearing that up, Paul. Now if Facebook will only reply to Richard\u2019s query about why they removed my original post and photo when he put it up on his wall\u2026 \n \n It has been erroneously reported in the media that our own Richard Metzger (who lives in Los Angeles) organized the London \u201cKiss-In\u201d event, which is untrue, and also unfair to Paul Shetler and the actual organizers. Also, Richard did not state in his post that Facebook HAD taken the event page down, he just questioned IF this was the case and IF there was a connection with MY post about the event being removed from his own wall. This seems to have confused some people. \n \n Here is a report on the John Snow Kiss-In from the Guardian, featuring an interview with Mr Shetler: \n \n ||||| || News || \n \n Page 1 of 1 \n \n \n \n \n \n UPDATED: A photo of two men kissing that was posted on a Facebook page protesting a London pub\u2019s decision to eject a same-sex couple for kissing has been removed by the social networking site, an error, according to a rep for the company. \n \n \n \n \"The photo in question does not violate our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities and was removed in error,\" the statement, obtained by America Blog, says. We apologize for the inconvenience\" \n \n \n \n The Dangerous Minds Facebook page was set up to promote a \u201cgay kiss-in\u201d demonstration in London to protest the pub. The page used a photo of two men kissing to promote the event. \n \n According to NYULocal.com, the photo was quickly removed and the following e-mail was sent to administrators of the Facebook page: \u201cShares that contain nudity, or any kind of graphic or sexually suggestive content, are not permitted on Facebook.\u201d \n \n \n \n The decision to remove the photo has prompted scores of people to post their own pictures of same-sex couples kissing in protest \u2014 dozens in the last few hours alone.",

    "document": "It's the Golden State's latest version of the Great Secession. \n \n \n \n Fed up by Sacramento's regulations and Southern California's political sway, residents in one rural Northern California county are taking steps to leave the state. \n \n The Siskiyou County Board of Supervisors voted, 4-1, on Tuesday to pursue seceding from California, the Redding Record Searchlight reported. Proponents say Siskiyou should form a new state -- called Jefferson -- with other counties in Northern California and Southern Oregon they believe share similar interests. \n \n On Tuesday more than 100 people filled the supervisors' chambers, many of whom indicated support for the declaration, the Searchlight reported. When a speaker asked those in the audience who was in favor, \"nearly every hand in the room was raised,\" the newspaper said. \n \n \"Many proposed laws are unconstitutional and deny us our God-given rights,\" said Happy Camp resident Gabe Garrison. \"We need our own state so we can make laws that fit our way of life.\" \n \n \"The state of Jefferson is the place I want to raise my son,\" Kayla Brown said. \n \n Resident complaints include a lack of representation in Sacramento and insufficient attention to major issues for the county, such as water rights and a rural fire prevention fee, the Searchlight reported. \n \n \"We have to have government that's local, understands our issues and has empathy,\" said Mark Baird, a rancher who the Searchlight said was heading the effort. \n \n Supervisor Marcia Armstrong cited restoration of limited government as one of the reasons she supported the declaration. \n \n \"We also have this enormous bureaucracy of unelected officials making decisions for us,\" she said. \n \n Supervisor Ed Valenzuela, who chairs the board, was the only vote against the decision, the Searchlight said. He cited the oath he took upon his reelection to \"uphold the Constitution and uphold the constitution of the state of California.\" \n \n \"I signed on to work within the system I know,\" he said. \"I don't like it, I don't agree with it all the time, but ... I did sign up for that and I will continue to do so.\" \n \n Neighboring counties, which would be invited to join Jefferson, are also weighing secession. Humboldt County Supervisor Rex Bohn told the Times-Standard that his board would probably meet to consider their options. \n \n \"I was one of the people who thinks the state of Jefferson wasn't a bad idea,\" he told the newspaper. \"There has been a total lack of respect of our water rights and the fire fee. Those things may not be important to the rest of the state, but it's important to us.\" \n \n Secession efforts within California date back to the 1800s. The most recent high-profile attempt came in 2011, when Riverside County officials weighed a proposal to pursue the establishment of \"South California,\" which would have seen 13 counties leave the Golden State. \n \n [For the Record, 1:50 p.m. PDT Sept. 4: An earlier version of this post incorrectly attributed Humboldt County Supervisor Rex Bohn's comments on the state of Jefferson to the Redding Record Searchlight. They were made to the Times-Standard.] \n \n ALSO: \n \n Rim fire: Containment of Yosemite-area blaze at 80% \n \n YouTube video shows Long Beach police repeatedly striking suspect \n \n Girl, 7, wounded in car-to-car shooting in Palmdale; three in custody \n \n Twitter: @katemather | Google+ \n \n kate.mather@latimes.com ||||| The Siskiyou County Board of Supervisors voted 4-1 on Tuesday to support the county's split from the state of California. \n \n It's the first in a long series of steps to form the proposed state of Jefferson, which proponents of the effort say would bring representation to rural North State counties that currently are beholden to the whims of representatives of the more heavily populated Southern California and free them from burdensome state regulations. \n \n \u201dWe have to have government that's local, understands our issues and has empathy\u201d for those affected, said Mark Baird, a Scott Valley rancher who's also president for Scott Valley Protect Our Water and vice president of the Siskiyou Water User's Association. \n \n Baird is leading the charge to form a new state from rural counties in Northern California and Southern Oregon, though he certainly wasn't the only voice in support of the move. \n \n More than 100 people packed the supervisors' chambers Tuesday for the discussion on whether the county should issue a declaration that it wants to secede from the state. Nearly all those in attendance appeared to be for the move and about a dozen spoke in support of it. \n \n \u201dMany proposed laws are unconstitutional and deny us our God-given rights,\u201d said Gabe Garrison of Happy Camp. \u201cWe need our own state so we can make laws that fit our way of life.\u201d \n \n Among those in attendance was Erin Ryan, field representative for Rep. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Doug LaMalfa. When asked for the congressman's opinion, she said that she and other LaMalfa staff members supported the effort to secede, but she did not know LaMalfa's thoughts on it. \n \n She also said there's support for the split in Sacramento. \n \n The discussion also attracted members of groups from Shasta and Tehama counties who are looking for their own supervisors to pass similar declarations. \n \n \u201dIt would be the only way I could see everyone coming together in a positive manner,\u201d said Tom Moller of Red Bluff. \n \n Also there was Kayla Brown, a mother in her early 20s, who said she didn't want to raise her child in California. \n \n \u201dThe state of Jefferson is the place I want to raise my son,\u201d she said. \n \n At one point in the meeting a speaker asked for a show of hands from those in attendance who supported the split. Nearly every hand in the room was raised. \n \n And supervisors echoed much of that enthusiasm in their own comments. \n \n \u201dI haven't had one contact in regard to this issue, that's in opposition,\u201d Supervisor Michael Kobseff said. \n \n Supervisor Marcia Armstrong said the issues were about regulation, restriction of rights, lack of representation, regionalism and restoration of limited government. \n \n \u201dWe also have this enormous bureaucracy of unelected officials making decisions for us,\u201d she said. \n \n Board Chair Ed Valenzuela was the sole vote against the declaration. He said he was elected to solve problems within the system. \n \n \u201dIt comes down to because I took an oath. I took an oath when I ran for re-election, which I just did, and that was to uphold the Constitution, and uphold the constitution of the state of California,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd within that, and because knowing what it's like to be a minority, I know the value of having to work from the other side without the numbers and without support. I signed on to do that, I signed on to work within the system I know. I don't like it, I don't agree with it all the time but at the same token, I did sign up for that and I will continue to do so.\u201d \n \n In August, county residents lobbied the board to consider separating from the state over a laundry list of complaints including a lack of representation in Sacramento for the Republican-majority county, issues pertaining to water rights and the rural fire prevention fee. \n \n If the county were to split from the state, any action taken today would be the first step in a long process that would require approval from the state Legislature and the U.S. Congress. \n \n Siskiyou County would also invite other neighboring counties in California and Southern Oregon to join in the effort to create a new state. \n \n The U.S. Constitution allows for the formation of new states, though land can't be taken from existing states without the consent of state and federal governments. \n \n Humboldt County 1st District Supervisor Rex Bohn said he can understand the frustration in Siskiyou County and that he tends to agree with most of the issues that were brought up by the board. \n \n \u201dI was one of the people who thinks the State of Jefferson wasn't a bad idea,\u201d Bohn said. \u201cThere has been a total lack of respect in terms of our water rights and the fire fee. Those things may not be important to the rest of the state, but it's important to us. This is a major thing for everyone that lives rurally.\u201d \n \n Bohn said the problem is that only 16 percent of the state is rural, and decisions in Sacramento are sometimes based on the needs or realities of more urban areas. \n \n \u201dIt's kind of a drastic measure to get someone to listen to you, but I guess they feel like they're not getting heard,\u201d he said. \n \n Bohn added that the Humboldt County supervisors will likely meet to discuss the issue. \n \n Humboldt County 3rd District Supervisor Mark Lovelace said he took the talk of secession as a statement of frustration. \n \n \u201dThere has to be basic economic underpinnings to make a state work,\u201d Lovelace said. \u201cThere is a certain romantic appeal and allure to the state of Jefferson, this entire idea of what could have been, but in reality it would not be good economically.\u201d \n \n He said one of the problems with a rural county seceding is that the tax base starts small. \n \n \u201dSiskiyou is one of the largest counties with one of the smallest populations,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is also full of state roads that they won't be able to maintain, and federal land.\u201d \n \n Times-Standard staff writer Catherine Wong contributed to this report.",

Either way, David Freeland sounded excited as he crossed the threshold where a famous Colonial-era tavern, the Bull\u2019s Head, once welcomed thirsty out-of-towners. \n \n \u201cThere are treasures inside,\u201d said Mr. Freeland, an author and a historian who researched the site for a book about a beer garden that later occupied the tavern\u2019s place on the Bowery. \n \n Photo \n \n But all he saw was debris from the building\u2019s most recent life, as a chain drugstore with a Chinese restaurant upstairs. He did not reach the treasures that thrilled local-history aficionados over the weekend \u2014 namely, some old-looking joists and foundation walls in the basement \u2014 because the steps were blocked by rubble. The site is to be cleared for a hotel. \n \n The joists were discovered by a photographer and preservationist, Adam Woodward, who suspects that structural elements of the Colonial-era tavern were used in the construction of the much larger beer hall, the Atlantic Garden. It reigned as \u201cone of the show places of New York\u201d from 1858 on, The New York Times said when it finally shut down in 1911. \n \n But what about the tavern where Washington established his temporary headquarters in November 1783 as the British withdrew? \n \n \u201cThe whole issue of whether the Bull\u2019s Head was buried inside the Atlantic Garden was one of the great mysteries of New York,\u201d Mr. Woodward said. \n \n Until, apparently, the other day, when he got a look inside. He saw iron work from the 19th century and I-beams from later on. And then he saw a stairway to the basement, and headed down. \n \n \u201cAt one point there was a distinct change in the building material, from cinder block to a brick-and-stone foundation wall,\u201d he said. \u201cI followed that wall and found myself at the front of the building, under the sidewalk at the Bowery, and looked up and saw what looked to me like 18th-century hand-hewn and hand-planed joists and beams with extremely wide floorboards right above them.\u201d \n \n He said, \u201cI was thinking, I am standing in the cellar of the Bull\u2019s Head.\u201d \n \n The Bull\u2019s Head opened around 1750 on the fringe of what was a still-young city concentrated below the Bowery. Washington and his troops marched down the Bowery and stopped there in 1783 before making \u201ctheir official entrance into the city proper,\u201d said Kerri Culhane, a historian who wrote the application that won the Bowery a place on the National Register of Historic Places. \n \n The neighborhood \u201cwas a butchers\u2019 district in the 18th century and the 19th century,\u201d Ms. Culhane said. \u201cPeople drove livestock down from the hinterland and the slaughterhouse was behind the Bowery. That\u2019s where the trading took place.\u201d \n \n It was also a home to the ancestors of future V.I.P.\u2019s. \u201cThe Astors started out as butchers,\u201d she said, but began snapping up land. They even owned the Bull\u2019s Head site. \n \n But the tavern closed. Mr. Freeland wrote that the building became a store that sold stoves until the Atlantic Garden opened as a beer garden. \n \n It was a popular gathering place for German immigrants in its early days, and in the 1870s and 1880s, the Atlantic Garden was raided repeatedly for selling beer on Sundays, when the city\u2019s excise laws appeared to forbid that. Mr. Freeland noted that the laws did not mention beer, only \u201cintoxicating liquors or wines.\u201d The Atlantic Garden\u2019s owner got off after one raid because the judge sampled the beer the police had seized and complained it was so watered down that \u201ca man might drink by the gallon without getting drunk.\u201d \n \n Later still, the Atlantic Garden became \u201ca place where Tin Pan Alley songwriters would go to plug their songs,\u201d Mr. Freeland said. One tune that apparently got its start there in the 1890s was \u201cDaisy Bell,\u201d the song that turned the phrase \u201cbicycle built for two\u201d into a catchphrase. \n \n Mr. Woodward said he hoped the demolition for the hotel could be delayed long enough for \u201ca proper archaeological exploration.\u201d (Calls to the owner were not returned on Monday.) \n \n \u201cI can\u2019t think of another lot in Manhattan that has a more important history,\u201d Mr. Woodward said, \u201cand the fact that it might be intact, a couple of feet under the building, is an incredible opportunity to get on archaeological record.\u201d \n \n \n \n ||||| Elected officials and the Landmarks Preservation Commission are both doing their best to launch a thorough investigation of what may very well be the famed 18th century saloon the Bull's Head Tavern, but their options are limited. Photographer Adam Woodward first documented the ancient, hand-planed wood joists and stone foundation in the basement of 50 Bowery last week, and both he and historian David Freeland are convinced that these are the remnants of Bull's Head. If so, this would be the oldest surviving structure in Manhattan by far, and as Woodward puts it, an \"incredible opportunity to get on archaeological record.\" But the fate of the site depends on the current owner, Alex Chu, who is demolishing the site to make way for a new hotel. \n \n The Landmarks Commission tells The Lo-Down that they're \"aware of the situation,\" but \"cannot require the owner to conduct archaeology.\" The best they can do is give the owner a list of good archaeologists. Some elected officials are also getting involved, but again they've got to take it up with Chu first. \n \n \u00b7 Landmarks Commission: No Jurisdiction to Mandate Historic Site Survey at 50 Bowery [TLD] \n \n \u00b7 All Coverage of Bull's Head Tavern [~ENY~]",

Adam Woodward had heard that the building at 50 Bowery, currently scheduled to be demolished so a hotel can go up, might have \"the Bull's Head's structure, cellar, bones,\" he tells CBS New York. So he searched the basement, and \"found myself in what I am pretty certain is the 1750s historic tavern,\" he says.

Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich in 2012 called President Barack Obama the \u201cfood stamp president,\u201d which led some to say his comment was racist. \n \n The debate over food stamps has led to a sort of chicken-and-egg argument between Republicans and Democrats. The GOP has said the end of the recession should allow Congress to reduce spending on food stamps. \n \n While Democrats have tried to give President Barack Obama credit for a rebounding economy, they also note that millions of additional people are using food stamps, and that the program should not be cut yet. The total number of people using food stamps has almost doubled since the start of the Great Recession, to nearly 48 million in 2013. \n \n The number finally dipped from that peak in 2014, but just a little, to about 46 million people. \n \n Republicans have tried since 2013 to cut food stamp spending, as part of their overall plan to slow spending and get control of the budget deficit. In 2013, the House voted to cut $39 billion from food stamps over a decade, and almost a year ago, President Barack Obama signed a final deal that will cut just $8.7 billion from the program over ten years. \n \n That cut was estimated to reduce food stamp benefits by about $90 per month for the hundreds of thousands of homes that use them. ||||| WASHINGTON The number of children in the United States relying on food stamps for a meal spiked to 16 million last year, according federal data, signaling a lopsided economic recovery in which lower income families are still lagging behind. \n \n The roughly one in five children who received food stamps in 2014 surpassed pre-recession levels, when one in eight or 9 million children were on food stamps, according to the U.S. Census survey of American families released on Wednesday \n \n Republicans in Congress have sought to cut back on the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program or food stamp program as part of a larger plan to balance the budget. \n \n Early last year lawmakers proposed $40 billion in cuts from the program over 10 years. The final farm bill signed into law trimmed $8.6 billion from the program, eliminating benefits for about 850,000 people, according to estimates by anti-hunger advocates. \n \n Other findings of the survey show a rapidly changing America in which more children are being raised in single-parent homes and more young people are delaying marriage. \n \n Of the 73.7 million children under 18 in the United States, 27 percent were living in single parent homes last year, tripling the 9 percent in 1960. \n \n The number of marriages also dwindled last year with less than half of households in America made up of married couples, compared to three-quarters in 1940, the survey found. \n \n The median age for people first getting married in 2014 was 29 for men and 27 for women up from 24 and 21 respectively in 1947. \n \n (Reporting by Elvina Nawaguna; Editing by Sandra Maler) ||||| The number of children receiving food stamps remains higher than it was before the start of the Great Recession in 2007, according to the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s annual Families and Living Arrangements table package released today. \n \n \n \n The rate of children living with married parents who receive food stamps has doubled since 2007.

Will the other candidates ignore the elephant in the room, and will Gingrich finally reach the top tier? David A. Graham on what to look for. Plus join Howard Kurtz for a live chat during the debate, starting at 8pm ET. \n \n After three weeks\u2019 respite, the packed Republican presidential debate season is about to return to full tilt. The GOP field will convene in a Detroit suburb on Wednesday for a debate hosted by CNBC. Using a traditional setup, the debate is supposed to focus on economic issues, including taxation, jobs, and the deficit, but fireworks are likely on a few other topics as well. Here\u2019s what to watch for Wednesday night. \n \n 1. Will the Herman Cain Allegations Take Center Stage? \n \n Last time around, Herman Cain was a target because his fortunes were rising, along with the popularity of his 9-9-9 plan. Much has happened since, and although his polls numbers have flat-lined, not tanked, repeated allegations of sexual harassment or worse seem to be on their way to derailing the Cain train. How will his rivals handle it? They could attack him directly; even the usually detached Romney edged that way Tuesday, saying the allegations against Cain were serious. But that might be unnecessary and counterproductive. Focusing on Cain\u2019s circus rather than, say, high unemployment is bad for the Republican brand, so they may instead let him bleed slowly as they avert their eyes. \n \n 2. Will the \u2018Not-Mitt\u2019 Movement Dent Romney\u2019s Armor? \n \n Although it\u2019s long been clear that Mitt Romney was the man to beat in the Republican field, the last two weeks have seen the anybody-but-Mitt movement crystallizing like never before. Bookended by scathing attacks by George Will and Erick Erickson\u2014the voices of the Old Republican Establishment and the Upstart Activist Right, respectively\u2014and peaking with the creation of the website Not Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor\u2019s opponents have come together, Transformers-style. But behind whom? With most of the rest of the field fading or too damaged to take up the standard, Jon Huntsman Jr., whose once-promising candidacy hasn\u2019t even gotten as far as spinning its wheels, is making a late play, producing his own anti-Romney ad. Can Huntsman or some other challenger dent Romney\u2019s armor? Or will the unflappable frontrunner parry all blows with the effortless, bland approach he\u2019s used so far? \n \n 3. Will Newt Gingrich Finally Join the First Tier? \n \n With Cain potentially on the outs, could Newt Gingrich finally be having his moment? The former House speaker could appeal to the same voters as Cain (they agree on plenty, as demonstrated by their lovefest on Saturday), he\u2019s experienced, and his campaign seems to have come back from several prematurely declared deaths. Indeed, he\u2019s rising in some polls. But Gingrich\u2019s previous debate performances have been polarizing. While some of the more cerebral Republican pundits gushed over his oratorical and rhetorical talents, he has a tendency to come across as petulantly contrarian and needlessly pedantic. If he can temper those tendencies, the debate could propel him to the first tier of the race. \n \n 4. Will Rick Perry and Michele Bachmann Show Up? \n \n Long, long ago\u2014if you can remember that far back\u2014both Michele Bachmann and Rick Perry were first-tier candidates. Their chances at returning to the top tier are slipping away quickly, though Perry\u2019s ample war chest is a crutch. It will be interesting to see how they try to claw back\u2014if at all. Will Perry come across as giddy and drunk, as he did in New Hampshire last month? Will Bachmann figuratively show up?

(Too late!) The crossbow\u2014a Barnett model equipped with a steel-tipped four-blade broadhead arrow\u2014is perched on the dash between us. It looks like you could shoot through a goddamn mountain with it. \n \n \u201cThat\u2019ll bury up in you and kill you dead,\u201d Phil says. \n \n The bow is cocked and loaded, just in case a deer stumbles in front of us and we need to do a redneck drive-by on the poor bastard, but the safety is on. SAFETY FIRST. Still, Phil warns me, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be bumping that.\u201d \n \n As we drive out into the woods, past a sign that reads parish maintenance ends, Phil is telling me all about the land around us and how the animals are a glorious gift from God and how blowing their heads off is part of His plan for us. \n \n \u201cLook at this,\u201d he says, gesturing to the surrounding wilderness. \u201cThe Almighty gave us this. Genesis 9 is where the animals went wild, and God gave them wildness. After the flood, that\u2019s when he made animals wild. Up until that time, everybody was vegetarian. After the flood, he said, \u2018I\u2019m giving you everything now. Animals are wild.\u2019\u201d \n \n There\u2019s a fly parked on Phil\u2019s long beard. It\u2019s been there the whole ride, and I desperately want to pluck it out, but I decide against it. Along with the crossbow, there\u2019s a loaded .22-caliber rifle rattling around in the footwell. And yet, much like the 14 million Americans who Nielsen says tune in to Duck Dynasty every week\u2014over 2 million more than the audience for the Breaking Bad finale\u2014I am comfortable here in these woods with Phil and his small cache of deadly weaponry. He is welcoming and gracious. He is a man who preaches the gospel of the outdoors and, to my great envy, practices what he preaches. He spends most of his time out here, daydreaming about what he calls a \u201cpristine earth\u201d: a world where nothing gets in the way of nature or the hunters who lovingly maintain it. No cities. No buildings. No highways. \n \n Oh, and no sinners, too. So here\u2019s where things get a bit uncomfortable. Phil calls himself a Bible-thumper, and holy shit, he thumps that Bible hard enough to ring the bell at a county-fair test of strength. If you watch Duck Dynasty, you can hear plenty of it in the nondenominational supper-table prayer the family recites at the end of every episode, and in the show\u2019s no-cussing, no-blaspheming tone. But there are more things Phil would like to say\u2014\u201ccontroversial\u201d things, as he puts it to me\u2014that don\u2019t make the cut. (This March, for instance, he told the Christian-oriented Sports Spectrum magazine that he didn\u2019t approve of A&E editing out \u201cin Jesus\u201d from a family prayer scene, even though A&E says that the phrase has been uttered in at least seventeen episodes.) \n \n Out here in these woods, without any cameras around, Phil is free to say what he wants. Maybe a little too free. He\u2019s got lots of thoughts on modern immorality, and there\u2019s no stopping them from rushing out. Like this one: \n \n \u201cIt seems like, to me, a vagina\u2014as a man\u2014would be more desirable than a man\u2019s anus. That\u2019s just me. I\u2019m just thinking: There\u2019s more there! She\u2019s got more to offer. I mean, come on, dudes! You know what I\u2019m saying? But hey, sin: It\u2019s not logical, my man. It\u2019s just not logical.\u201d \n \n Perhaps we\u2019ll be needing that seat belt after all. \n \n \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \n \n The Duck Dynasty origin story is the mighty river from which all other Robertson-family stories flow. And it is an awesome story, one that improves the more it is told, so here is my stab at it: Phil Robertson grew up bone poor in the northwest corner of this state\u2014a place where Cajun redneck culture and Ozark redneck culture intersect\u2014to a manic-depressive mother and a roughneck father. He was a star quarterback in high school and earned a scholarship to play at Louisiana Tech, but quit after one season because football interfered with duck-hunting season. The guy who took his roster spot at Tech was Terry Bradshaw, because that\u2019s how these kinds of stories go. \n \n Phil On Growing Up in Pre-Civil-Rights-Era Louisiana \n \n \u201cI never, with my eyes, saw the mistreatment of any black person. Not once. Where we lived was all farmers. The blacks worked for the farmers. I hoed cotton with them. I\u2019m with the blacks, because we\u2019re white trash. We\u2019re going across the field.... They\u2019re singing and happy. I never heard one of them, one black person, say, \u2018I tell you what: These doggone white people\u2019\u2014not a word!... Pre-entitlement, pre-welfare, you say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues.\u201d \n \n According to Phil\u2019s autobiography\u2014a ghostwritten book he says he has never read\u2014he spent his days after Tech doing odd jobs and his evenings getting drunk, chasing tail, and swallowing diet pills and black mollies, a form of medicinal speed. In his midtwenties, already married with three sons, a piss-drunk Robertson kicked his family out of the house. \u201cI\u2019m sick of you,\u201d he told his wife, Kay. But Robertson soon realized the error of his ways, begged Kay to come back, and turned over his life to Jesus Christ. \n \n In 1972, with Jesus at the wheel, Robertson founded the Duck Commander company, which sold a line of custom-made duck-hunting calls that quickly became popular among avid hunters for their uncanny accuracy in replicating the sound of a real duck. He eventually sold half the company to his son Willie, now 41, and together they made a DVD series about the family\u2019s duck hunts, which led to a show on the Outdoor Channel, which led to Duck Dynasty on A&E, which led to everything blowing right the fuck up. \n \n The show\u2014a reality sitcom showcasing the semiscripted high jinks of Phil, his brother \u201cUncle Si,\u201d his four sons, Alan, Willie, Jase, and Jep, and the perpetually exasperated but always perfectly accessorized Robertson-family ladies\u2014has become the biggest reality-TV hit in the history of cable television, reportedly earning the family a holy shit\u2013worthy $200,000-an-episode paycheck. It\u2019s a funny, family-friendly show, with \u201cskits that we come up with,\u201d as Phil describes the writing process. They plunder beehives. They blow up beaver dams. And when the Robertson-family ladies go up to a rooftop in a hydraulic lift, you just know that lift will \u201caccidentally\u201d get stuck and strand them. \n \n But the show, whose fifth season premieres on January 15, is just one part of the family\u2019s pop-cultural dominance. In 2013 four books written (kind of!) by Robertson family members made the top ten on the New York Times nonfiction best-seller list. Another book\u2014penned by Jase Robertson and detailing his Christian rebirth at age 14, his struggle to forgive his father\u2019s past behavior, and his young daughter\u2019s struggle through five facial-reconstruction surgeries to overcome a severe cleft lip and palate\u2014is forthcoming and destined to make it five best-sellers. There\u2019s also a book of devotionals somewhere in there, along with Duck Dynasty\u2013themed birthday cards, bobblehead dolls, camo apparel (pink camo for the ladies), Cajun-spice seasoning, car fresheners, iPhone games (from the press release: \u201cAs players successfully complete the challenges, their beards grow to epic proportions and they start to transform from a yuppie into a full-blown redneck!\u201d), and presumably some sort of camou flage home-pregnancy test. \n \n It\u2019s easy to see the appeal. The Robertsons are immensely likable. They\u2019re funny. They look cool. They\u2019re \u201csmarter than they look,\u201d says sportswriter Mark Schlabach, who co-writes the family\u2019s books. And they are remarkably honest both with one another and with the viewing audience: Phil\u2019s old hell-raising, Si\u2019s traumatic stint in Vietnam, the intervention that the family staged for Jep when he was boozing and doing drugs in college (Phil placed him under house arrest for three months)\u2014all of it is out in the open. The more they reveal, the more people feel connected to them. \n \n And then, of course, there is their faith, which plays no small role here. During the family\u2019s initial negotiations about the show with A&E, Jase told me, \u201cthe three no-compromises were faith, betrayal of family members, and duck season.\u201d That refusal to betray their faith or one another has been a staple of every media article about the Robertson family. It\u2019s their elevator pitch, and it has made them into ideal Christian icons: beloved for staking out a bit of holy ground within the mostly secular, often downright sinful, pop culture of America. \n \n \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \n \n Phil Robertson\u2019s house is located in the sticks about twenty miles outside the city of Monroe (pronounce it mun-roe). It\u2019s a rather small house\u2014the kind of place its owner would proudly call \u201chumble.\u201d The kitchen table is covered with big plastic tubs of cinnamon rolls and mini muffins. There are candy dishes filled to the brim, bricks of softening butter, and packages of jerky made from unknown animals, sent by unnamed fans. (I tried some, and it was awesome.) Just inside the front door, a giant flat-screen TV shows Fox News on mute at all times, and a bunch of big squishy sofas are arranged in a rectangle around it. \n \n Si Robertson is sitting on the couch facing the TV. Jep Robertson, age 35, the youngest son, curls up in a recliner in the corner with a pistol strapped to his waist. He barely speaks, like a countrified Silent Bob. Jase, 44, and Willie share a love seat while Phil lounges barefoot on a camo-patterned recliner in the far corner of the room. Two dogs share the recliner\u2019s footrest with Phil\u2019s heavily callused bare feet. He has severe bunions, so his big toes jut in at forty-five-degree angles. The main TV room is cluttered with mismatched furniture and photos hung haphazardly on the walls. And Phil looks like part of the clutter himself, as if he\u2019d been wedged into that recliner a while back by some absentminded homeowner who didn\u2019t know where else to put him. ||||| (Photo Credit: Getty Images) \n \n Jesse Jackson has decided to weigh in on the inflammatory comments that Phil Robertson made to GQ about gays and African Americans. \n \n In an interview with Drew Magary, the \"Duck Dynasty\" star said the Nazis needed Jesus, that he never saw the mistreatment of African Americans while growing up in Louisiana before the civil rights era and that homosexuality was a sin. \n \n A&E; has already suspended Robertson, but Reverend Jackson, his Rainbow PUSH Coalition and GLAAD are demanding to meet with network execs, along with Cracker Barrel's CEO, to discuss the future of all \"Duck Dynasty\" memorabilia or content. \n \n Read: Phil Robertson Defends Anti-Gay Comments: 'All I Did Was Quote From The Scriptures' \n \n \"These statements uttered by Robertson are more offensive than the bus driver in Montgomery, Alabama, more than 59 years ago,\" Jackson said in a statement obtained by ABC News. \n \n \"At least the bus driver, who ordered Rosa Parks to surrender her seat to a white person, was following state law.

He is now undergoing interrogation. \n \n \n \n The senior analyst in Seoul for the International Crisis Group, Daniel Pinkston, says there is no indication the defection denotes any instability in the reclusive and impoverished state. \n \n \n \n \u201cWe'll see as he's debriefed and it's just a one-off incident, so I don't think there's too much we can read into it besides that at this point,\u201d he said. \n \n \n \n Pinkston points out that soldiers in North Korea's army posted to the border area are scrupulously vetted. \n \n \n \n \u201cThose who are stationed in the border area, around the DMZ and especially right on the DMZ, are those who are considered to be loyal to the regime.

However, there is no sign of any unusual activity on the northern side. \n \n \n \n The DMZ is a legacy of the 1953 armistice which brought a three-year civil war to a halt.

The Raleigh News & Observer says that Deena Murphy and Timothy Sullivan agreed to participate in the hit HGTV series under the guise that they were considering a move to a rental property with their teenage foster children. The problem, according to the suit against Big Coat TV and Aaron Fitz Construction, was that the show\u2019s principals\u2014designer Hilary Farr, real estate agent David Visentin, and contractor Eric Eremita\u2014are \u201cactors or television personalities playing a role for the camera,\u201d not people who \u201cplayed more than a casual role in the actual renovation process.\u201d While this shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to anyone who\u2019s ever suffered through Farr and Visentin\u2019s bullshit \u201cno, you are\u201d banter, it\u2019s still mildly disheartening to hear. \n \n For the episode, which aired in April 2015, Murphy and Sullivan were asked to deposit $140,000 into a fund with the production company, who would later use that money to pay Fitz and other subcontractors. According to the suit, the couple voiced its concerns about Fitz, saying it had below-average reviews on Angie\u2019s List, but they were ignored. Over the course of the renovations, only $85,780.50 was disbursed to Fitz, leaving the couple wondering where the rest of their money went. The suit also questions how Big Coat can operate as a general contractor, a role it\u2019s not licensed for. \n \n Murphy and Sullivan are also claiming that Love It Or List It is even more of a scam than it generally seems, with the couple saying the show never used a licensed architect to develop plans for their house, and that they were never shown houses that were actually for sale in North Carolina\u2014or for sale by any licensed North Carolina real estate broker. They also say any work done on the show was work that they\u2019d previously made plans for with another company, Werx-Design Build. \n \n According to the suit, the actual work done on the house was \u201cdisastrous,\u201d leaving the home \u201cirreparably damaged.\u201d Duct work was left open, leading to vermin entering the house, and the couple complains of \u201clow-grade industrial carpeting, unpainted surfaces, and windows painted shut.\u201d \n \n As the News & Observer summarizes, \u201cBig Coat\u2019s purported agreement,\u201d the lawsuit contends, \u2018admits that it is in the business of television production, not construction. ...

(Photo: Michael Sears / Milwaukee Journal Sentinel) \n \n Anissa Weier plans to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect in the Slender Man stabbing case next week. \n \n Weier's co-defendant, Morgan Geyser, had already entered such a plea, often referred to as NGI, at a hearing last month. \n \n At the time, prosecutors pressed the judge to inquire whether Weier might go the same route, since it requires the court to appoint doctors to examine the defendant and report whether their condition would support the plea. One of Weier's attorneys, Maura McMahon, said the defense had not yet decided. \n \n But in a pleading filed this week, McMahon indicated that Weier now wants to change her not guilty plea to the insanity plea. A hearing was set for Sept. 9 for that change of plea. \n \n Weier and Geyser, both 14, were 12 when prosecutors say they plotted and attempted to kill their sixth-grade classmate and friend Payton Leutner in May 2014. \n \n ARCHIVE: Slender Man case coverage \n \n Leutner was stabbed 19 times and left for dead in a Waukesha park the morning after a sleepover party for Geyser's 12th birthday, but managed to crawl near a path, where she was found by a passing bicyclist. \n \n Both defendants later told police they were trying to either impress or avoid the wrath of Slender Man, a fictional internet boogeyman the girls said they believed would harm them or their families if they didn't kill their friend. \n \n They remain charged as adults with attempted first-degree intentional homicide, after efforts to have their cases transferred to juvenile court were denied. \n \n A defendant entering an NGI plea contends that at the time she committed a crime, a mental disease or defect prevented her from appreciating the wrongfulness of her action, or from conforming her conduct to the law. \n \n Someone found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect is typically committed to a state mental hospital for treatment. \n \n Geyser, who has been diagnosed with early onset schizophrenia, has already spent months at Winnebago Mental Health Institute under a separate civil commitment. \n \n During earlier hearings, mental health experts testified that Weier was competent to proceed with the case, but had not done more extensive evaluations required for an NGI review. She remains at a West Bend juvenile detention center. \n \n No trial date has been set in the case. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://on.jsonl.in/2civi3X ||||| Two girls accused of trying to kill a classmate to please horror character Slender Man want jurors from outside their home county to decide their trials. \n \n \n \n Morgan Geyser's attorneys filed a motion this week seeking jurors from outside Waukesha County because of heavy media coverage.

The letter noted that girl plans to plead not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect. \n \n \n \n Investigators say Geyser and Anissa Weier, who were 12 at the time of the 2014 attack, plotted for months before luring the victim, who also was 12, into some woods and repeatedly stabbing her. The girls hoped killing her would please Slender Man, a demon-like character in online stories. \n \n \n \n The victim crawled out of the woods to get help. \n \n Both girls face an attempted homicide charge in adult court.

Zimmerman claimed he shot Martin in self-defense. \n \n A somber Obama on Friday commiserated with the Martin family and urged authorities to fully investigate the shooting. \n \n \"If I had a son he would look like Trayvon,\" Obama said. \"I think (his parents) are right to expect that all of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves and we will get to the bottom of exactly what happened.\" \n \n Santorum said the president politicized the events, while Gingrich characterized Obama's comments as \"nonsense.\" \n \n \"What the president of the United States should do is try to bring people together, not use these types of horrible and tragic individual cases to try to drive a wedge in America,\" Santorum said Friday on \"The Hugh Hewitt Show,\" a radio program. \n \n \"Is the president suggesting if it had been a white who had been shot, that would be OK because it wouldn't look like him? That's just nonsense,\" Gingrich said Friday on conservative host Sean Hannity's radio show, \"The Hannity Show.\" \"I mean dividing this country up, it is a tragedy this young man was shot.\" \n \n But Plouffe, who served as Obama's 2008 campaign manager, said the Republican reaction is evidence of a circus-like primary. \n \n \"I don't think there's very many people in America that would share that reaction. You know, this Republican primary at some points has been more of a circus show and a clown show,\" Plouffe told CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley. \n \n Although he indicated the Obama campaign expects Romney to be the Republican nominee, Plouffe also predicted an aggressive election come fall. \n \n \"Romney has a big delegate lead so we've always felt you know because Romney's won a couple of big states lately, the fundamentals kind of support him,\" Plouffe said. \"But it's going to be a close competitive race no matter who come out the other side.\" \n \n Also see: \n \n Santorum's Louisiana win does little to change the game of delegate math \n \n \u2018Math isn\u2019t adding up,\u2019 Gingrich delegate says \n \n Santorum video: 'Obamaville' is a house of horrors \n \n Watch State of the Union with Candy Crowley Sundays at 9am ET.

So the American people have to understand, if Mitt Romney's elected president, he'll rubber-stamp that budget. And here's what that budget is. It fails the standard -- it fails the test of balance and fairness and shared responsibility. It showers huge additional tax cuts on the wealthy ... that are paid for by veterans and seniors and the middle class, so it's not a balanced approach.\" \n \n \"So the president's approach is the right approach. It's the balanced approach,\" Plouffe said. \"Anybody out there that's offered a deficit reduction plan, any expert says it's got to have balance, which means it's got to cut spending, and we've already cut a lot of spending, almost $2 trillion. It's got to reform entitlements in the right way.

Over the years, Bruce Springsteen, Paul McCartney, U2, The Who, Katy Perry and even the Black Eyed Peas have all performed, and of course the 2004 set from Janet Jackson (featuring Timberlake) was marred by controversy due to her \u201cwardrobe malfunction.\u201d Prince\u2019s 2007 performance \u2014 which saw him playing a galvanizing version of \u201cPurple Rain\u201d in a rainstorm \u2014 is widely regarded as the all-time best halftime set. \n \n The NFL has faced an additional challenge this year due to its stance regarding former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick\u2019s decision to take a knee during the National Anthem as a sign of protest, which has spurred outrage in some quarters, from the president on down. Kaepernick has not played since the 2016 season and his contract has not been picked up by another team, largely due to the controversy.

    "document": "Follow Friday\u2019s updates on the Kavanaugh hearing here: John Dean to warn of a \u2018pro-presidential powers\u2019 Supreme Court \n \n Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh is appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday as senators continue publicly interviewing President Trump\u2019s nominee for the Supreme Court. \n \n Kavanaugh, a member of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, has a good chance of being confirmed when the Senate votes later this month. Under questioning from senators, he has so far touched on Roe v. Wade, said courts \u2014 not the president \u2014 are \u201cthe final word\u201d and, as the hearing began, watched drama unfold regarding Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.)\u2019s pledge to release confidential documents. \n \n Key moments from the hearing: \n \n \u2022 Drama over confidential emails....that were already cleared for public release \n \n \u2022 Kavanaugh advised against calling Roe \u201csettled law\u201d \n \n \u2022 Kavanaugh elaborates on dissent on contraception and religious objections \n \n \u2022 Emails show more involvement with nominee than Kavanaugh previously suggested \n \n 10:13 p.m.: Hearing adjourned \n \n More than 12 hours after the questioning began Thursday morning, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) adjourned the confirmation hearing for the day. Grassley closed the session by praising Kavanaugh for his \u201ccompelling and credible\u201d answers, highlighted his history on the bench and said that \u201cunquestionably, you\u2019re qualified to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d \n \n \u201cI hope a lot of people in this country have formed very positive views of you, as I have,\u201d Grassley said. \n \n Kavanaugh spent nearly 24 hours over two days answering questions, with many of the discussions on Thursday centering in some way or another on President Trump, who nominated Kavanaugh to the high court. Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, including some Republicans, pressed Kavanaugh about his expansive views of presidential power and past writings that concluded civil suits and criminal investigations of presidents would be better delayed until the chief executive left office. Read more about Thursday\u2019s hearing here. \n \n Friday is the fourth and final scheduled day of Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearing, which will feature comments from witnesses. \n \n \u2014 Mark Berman \n \n 8:55 p.m.: Behind the dramatic release of once-concealed documents \n \n The dramatic release Thursday of once-concealed documents from Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s tenure in the George W. Bush White House spotlighted the simmering frustrations from Democrats over how Republicans have kept secret vast parts of Kavanaugh\u2019s voluminous paper trail. \n \n Tens of thousands of pages from Kavanaugh\u2019s records have been hidden from public view, only available to senators and certain congressional aides in advance of Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearings this week. \n \n On Thursday, a small sample of the \u201ccommittee confidential\u201d documents were disclosed after Democratic senators asked that they be approved for public release, raising questions about why the documents had been considered confidential in the first place. \n \n Read more here. \n \n 7:30 p.m.: Pressed on gay rights, Kavanaugh declines to say same-sex marriage ruling was correctly decided \n \n Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) pressed Kavanaugh for the first time Thursday night about gay rights. The judge refused to answer whether the high court\u2019s ruling declaring a constitutional right for same-sex couples to marry was correctly decided. \n \n Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the man Kavanaugh would replace on the bench, cast the deciding vote in the case, Obergefell v. Hodges. \n \n Kavanaugh instead read aloud from another Kennedy ruling this year involving gay rights in which the justice wrote that gay people \u201ccannot be treated as social outcasts or as inferior in dignity and worth.\u201d \n \n Harris noted that Kavanaugh earlier this week characterized the landmark decision declaring segregated schools unconstitutional as a great moment in history, and asked whether the high court\u2019s decision legalizing gay marriage was a similar moment. \n \n The judge said only that it was precedent. \n \n The White House sent out information on Kavanaugh\u2019s record on gay rights soon after the exchange, noting that Kavanaugh has not had a major case involving gay rights in his 12 years on the D.C. Circuit. \n \n \u201cKavanaugh rules fairly and impartially based on the law, not the identity of the parties before him, and he has a record of faithfully applying legal protections for racial minorities, women, and other protected groups,\u201dthe White House statement said. \n \n \u2014 Ann E. Marimow \n \n 7:11 p.m.: Kavanaugh, pressed again, said he has not discussed the Mueller probe \n \n Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), who late Wednesday asked Kavanaugh if he had discussed special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election with attorneys at the law firm founded by President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, questioned him again Thursday. \n \n Picking up a line of inquiry that her colleagues, including Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), had followed during the day, Harris peppered him with follow-up questions. Noting that he had denied having \u201cinappropriate\u201d conversations about it, Harris asking Kavanaugh if he had discussions regarding the special counsel\u2019s probe and whether he had discussed it with anyone at Kasowitz\u2019s firm, saying she had unspecified \u201creliable information\u201d he had done the latter. (The firm denied this earlier in the day). \n \n Kavanaugh asked Harris if she was asking whether he spoke to anyone specific about it, but she said that was not the question. \n \n \u201cThat is not the subject of the question, sir,\u201d she said. \u201cThe subject of the question is you and whether you were part of a conversation regarding special counsel Mueller\u2019s investigation.\u201d \n \n Kavanaugh, nearly a day after their exchange late Wednesday, responded: \u201cThe answer\u2019s no.\u201d \n \n Harris replied by thanking him and saying \u201cit would have been great if you could\u2019ve said that last night,\u201d prompting Kavanaugh to begin a reply before cutting him off. \n \n \u201cLet\u2019s move on,\u201d Harris said. \n \n The end of the exchange prompted a rare reaction from White House counsel Donald McGahn, who has largely kept his poker face during the hearings while seated behind Kavanaugh in clear view of the cameras. After Harris\u2019s remark about moving on, McGahn gave a slight shake of his head and briefly arched his eyebrows. \n \n \u2014 Mark Berman \n \n 6:52 p.m.: Booker asks why Kavanaugh won\u2019t recuse himself from the Mueller probe \n \n Hours after Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) took center stage with drama over some of the documents the committee had, he had a chance to speak to Kavanaugh, pressing the judge on a variation of a question he had been asked previously during the hearings: Why not recuse himself from any court matters that would involve the ongoing special counsel probe because, as Booker said, \u201cit\u2019s really important that the Supreme Court be above suspicion\u201d? \n \n Kavanaugh responded by saying doing so would mean showing he did not have judicial independence. \n \n \u201cAll I would be doing is demonstrating that I don\u2019t have the independence of the judiciary \u2026 that is necessary to be a good judge,\u201d Kavanaugh responded. \u201cAll of the nominees who\u2019ve gone before have declined to commit because that would be inconsistent with judicial independence.\u201d \n \n \u2014 Seung Min Kim \n \n 5:50 p.m.: Hearing pauses for dinner \n \n The hearing was halted until 6:15 p.m. for a dinner break. After that, four senators will get their turns to question Kavanaugh before the committee opens up a new round of questioning. \n \n 5:15 p.m.: Kavanaugh declines to condemn Trump\u2019s attacks on judiciary \n \n Kavanaugh refused to repudiate what Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) described as President Trump\u2019s \u201cblatant, craven and repeated attacks\u201d on the federal judiciary. \n \n Blumenthal was referring to Trump\u2019s criticism that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg \u201chas embarrassed us all\u201d and \u201cher mind is shot.\u201d Ginsburg had been critical of Trump, prompting him to make the comments on Twitter during the 2016 presidential campaign. \n \n Kavanaugh took a pass, saying he did not want to \u201cget within three Zip codes\u201d of such a political controversy. \n \n Blumemthal noted that the president\u2019s first Supreme Court pick, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, explicitly condemned Trump\u2019s attacks as \u201cdisheartening\u201d and \u201cdemoralizing.\u201d Gorsuch spoke generally, but his comments came after the president had criticized the ethnic background of Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who ruled against the administration\u2019s travel ban. \n \n Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) followed up, suggesting that the judge was resisting any criticism of President Trump. \n \n Kavanaugh disagreed. As a judge, he said, \u201cWe stay out of politics, we don\u2019t comment on comments made by politicians.\u201d \n \n \u2014 Ann E. Marimow \n \n 5:08 p.m.: Blumenthal presses Kavanaugh on Mueller probe \n \n The ongoing special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election took center stage at the hearing again Thursday afternoon \u2014 this time, in a line of questioning from Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). \n \n Following questions on Wednesday night and again Thursday morning, Kavanaugh was again pressed about special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s probe, which could eventually make its way before a Supreme Court featuring Kavanaugh as a member. \n \n Blumenthal asked Kavanaugh if he had ever discussed the investigation with anyone, and Kavanaugh echoed his earlier remark in saying: \u201cI\u2019ve had no inappropriate discussions with anyone.\u201d \n \n Blumenthal followed that by asking if the judge had ever discussed the investigation with anyone, whether appropriately or inappropriately. Kavanaugh acknowledged that it had come up \u2014 \u201cIf you\u2019re walking around in America it\u2019s coming up, senator\u201d \u2014 but he also repeatedly emphasized that he never crossed any lines in discussing it. \n \n \u201cI\u2019ve never suggested anything about my views about anything, commitments, foreshadowing, I\u2019ve had no inappropriate discussions,\u201d he said. \n \n Blumenthal then pivoted to asking if Kavanaugh had discussed it with anyone in the White House, including Donald McGahn, the White House counsel seated behind Kavanaugh during the hearings. When Blumenthal asked Kavanaugh if he had discussed the probe with McGahn or anyone else in the White House, calling it a yes or no question, Kavanaugh said: \u201cI\u2019m not remembering any discussions like that.\u201d \n \n He added, though, that during his preparations for the confirmation hearings, he had readied for queries like the ones Blumenthal had posed. The questioning grew mildly tense, with Blumenthal suggesting that Kavanaugh\u2019s answers were ambiguous, which the judge disputed. \n \n After Blumenthal finished his questioning, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) broke in to ask Kavanaugh if he had ever suggested to anyone how he would rule on any matter related to the Mueller probe, and the judge answered: \u201cNo, I have not.\u201d \n \n Blumenthal followed up his questions about the probe by asking whether Kavanaugh had discussed the inquiry with anyone at the law firm founded by President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz. \n \n Earlier on Thursday, the firm Kasowitz Benson Torres said in a statement that \u201cno discussions\u201d regarding the probe had occurred \u201cbetween Judge Kavanaugh and anyone at our firm.\u201d \n \n When asked by Blumenthal, Kavanaugh echoed his earlier comments that he did not remember any discussions with anyone at the firm about the probe. When asked if he knew Kasowitz, Kavanaugh said no. \n \n When asked if he knew anyone at the firm, Kavanaugh said yes, naming Ed McNally, who used to work at the White House counsel\u2019s office and is now at the firm. Kavanaugh said he had not discussed the special counsel\u2019s probe with McNally. \n \n \u2014 Mark Berman \n \n 3:35 p.m.: Kavanaugh tries to clarify involvement in judge\u2019s confirmation \n \n Kavanaugh on Thursday discussed his involvement in the confirmation of now-Judge William H. Pryor Jr. to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit \u2014 clarifying his testimony from 2004 when he said he hadn\u2019t handled that nomination when he served as an associate White House counsel. \n \n The nominee\u2019s comments came after the new disclosure of emails earlier Thursday that detailed what appeared to be Kavanaugh\u2019s involvement in Pryor\u2019s confirmation fight, including conference calls to coordinate strategy and meetings to discuss plans for the nominee\u2019s hearings. \n \n Kavanaugh explained Thursday that in the George W. Bush White House counsel\u2019s office, one person would be assigned to handle the confirmation of each judicial nominee. \u201cAs I recall at least, I was not the primary person on that,\u201d Kavanaugh said, referring to Pryor\u2019s nomination. \n \n While Kavanaugh said he didn\u2019t recall specifics of his involvement, some examples he cited were attendance at meetings and mock hearing sessions. \n \n In 2004, during his confirmation hearing for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Kavanaugh said several times under questioning by then-Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) that he had not been involved with Pryor\u2019s confirmation. \n \n \u201cI am familiar generally with Mr. Pryor, but that was not one that I worked on personally,\u201d Kavanaugh testified then, although he noted during the hearing that he knew Pryor. Upon further questioning, Kavanaugh said: \u201cI was not involved in handling his nomination.\u201d \n \n Kavanaugh, with the help of Grassley, clarified another one of the emails involving Pryor. On Dec. 16, 2002, Kavanaugh received an email from another White House aide with the subject line \u201cCA11\u201d \u2014 a reference to the 11th Circuit. The aide, Kyle Sampson, asked: \u201cHow did the Pryor interview go?\u201d Kavanaugh then responded: \u201cCall me.\u201d \n \n Grassley, noting that Democrats attempted to \u201cinsinuate that you interviewed Judge Pryor,\u201d asked Kavanaugh: It\u2019s \u201cmore likely to indicate that you know the people who interviewed Judge Pryor?\u201d \n \n Kavanaugh responded: \u201cThat sounds correct.\u201d \n \n \u2014 Seung Min Kim \n \n 2:56 p.m.: Kavanaugh elaborates on dissent on contraception and religious objections \n \n Advocates for reproductive rights are concerned about the contraceptive-coverage requirement in the Affordable Care Act, widely known as Obamacare. In a 2015 case, Kavanaugh dissented from his colleagues and sided with the group Priests for Life, which argued that a provision in the law to opt out for religious objections was too burdensome. \n \n Kavanaugh elaborated Thursday on the basis for his dissent, telling Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) that \u201cthe government had ways to ensure contraceptive coverage without doing so on the backs of religious objectors.\u201d \n \n The issue remains in court after the Trump administration issued new rules making it easier for employers to refuse to provide coverage for birth control on the basis of religious objections. \n \n Cruz also asked the judge about a case on which he worked as a lawyer in private practice in which he backed a high school\u2019s decision to allow student-led prayers over the public address system at football games. He argued that students were delivering their own messages, not speaking on behalf of the school. The Supreme Court disagreed, finding the policy unconstitutional. \n \n \u201cReligious people, speakers and speech are entitled to equal treatment,\u201d Kavanaugh said Thursday. \n \n \u2014 Ann E. Marimow \n \n 2:41 p.m.: Kasowitz firm denies discussing special counsel probe with Kavanaugh \n \n In one of the most widely noticed parts of the hearings, Kavanaugh was questioned late Wednesday by Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) about whether he had discussed special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election with attorneys at the law firm founded by President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz. \n \n On Thursday, Kavanaugh was asked again about this by Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), who gave the judge an opportunity to clarify his responses to Harris. Kavanaugh said he did not \u201crecall any conversations of that kind,\u201d adding that he was not familiar with the names of all of the attorneys from the firm Kasowitz Benson Torres. \n \n Kavanaugh said he had not had any \u201cinappropriate conversations\u201d or commented on his views about the legal aspects of the probe, elements of which could potentially make it to the Supreme Court. \n \n On Thursday, the Kasowitz firm also said that no one there had discussed the probe with Kavanaugh. \n \n \u201cThere have been no discussions regarding Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation between Judge Kavanaugh and anyone at our firm,\u201d the law firm said in a statement. \n \n \u2014 Mark Berman \n \n 1:57 p.m.: Hearings resume after lunch break \n \n After pausing for lunch, the hearings are getting back underway. The first hours brought an extended drama over documents as well as questions about abortion, executive power and the special counsel\u2019s probe, with extensive questioning still expected for the remainder of the day. \n \n 1:38 p.m.: The drama over \u2018confidential\u2019 emails \u2014 which were already cleared for public release \n \n Democrats mounted dramatic protests Thursday over documents related to Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s tenure in the George W. Bush White House, as senators began releasing his emails that had been withheld from the public. \n \n The records that Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) posted on their websites Thursday morning had, in fact, already been cleared for public release, according to Democratic and Republican aides on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Those documents were cleared earlier Thursday morning, according to spokesmen for both sides. \n \n Nevertheless, the drama over the emails once marked \u201ccommittee confidential\u201d engulfed much of the third day of Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearings, with Booker vowing to disclose them in defiance of Senate rules. \n \n \u201cI openly invite and accept the consequences of releasing that email right now,\u201d Booker said. \u201cThe emails are being withheld from the public have nothing to do with national security.\u201d \n \n Bill Burck, Bush\u2019s presidential records representative, said later Thursday, \u201cWe cleared the documents last night shortly after Senator Booker\u2019s staff asked us to. We were surprised to learn about Senator Booker\u2019s histrionics this morning because we had already told him he could use the documents publicly. In fact, we have said yes to every request made by the Senate Democrats to make documents public.\u201d \n \n Such theatrics have characterized Kavanaugh\u2019s hearings, in which Democrats have repeatedly complained that Republicans have withheld documents from the committee and the public that shed important light on Kavanaugh\u2019s past. \n \n The documents that took center stage on Thursday were labeled \u201ccommittee confidential\u201d \u2014 available for any senators to view but shielded from the public. \n \n Late Wednesday, a handful of Democratic senators sent Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) several requests to make emails once marked \u201ccommittee confidential\u201d available to the public so they could discuss them during the public hearing on Thursday. Those records are being cleared as the Justice Department reviews them, as well as representatives for Bush. \n \n Booker may have violated Senate rules late Wednesday, when he spoke about the content of emails that technically were still under \u201ccommittee confidential\u201d status at that point. \n \n \u201cYou\u2019ve also written that an effort designed to benefit minority-owned businesses, an effort to try to give them a fair shake because they had been historically excluded \u2014 and these are your words now \u2014 used a lot of legalisms and disguises to mask what is, in reality, a naked racial set-aside. That\u2019s what you said. That\u2019s how you referred to it,\u201d Booker said, referring to one of the emails from Kavanaugh. \n \n Later in his questioning, Booker referred again to the committee confidential emails: \u201cI have letters here, sir, that have asked for \u2014 now, the one email specifically entitled racial profiling that somehow \u2014 I mean, literally the email was entitled racial profiling, that somehow was designated as something that the public couldn\u2019t see. This wasn\u2019t \u2014 this wasn\u2019t personal information.\u201d \n \n Releasing \u201ccommittee confidential\u201d information violates Senate rules and could result in expulsion from the Senate. But whether the Senate actually pursues the violation is a separate question. \n \n \u2014 Seung Min Kim \n \n 1:17 p.m.: Hearing pauses for lunch \n \n Grassley paused the hearing for a lunch break, which he said would take 30 minutes but potentially longer, noting that senators have two votes scheduled this afternoon. \n \n 1:10 p.m.: Court orders, not the president, are \u201cthe final word,\u201d Kavanaugh says \n \n Senate Democrats raised concerns Thursday about the president\u2019s attacks this week on the Justice Department and Kavanaugh\u2019s broad view of executive power expressed in his legal opinions and speeches. In a tweet on Monday, Trump criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for the recent indictments of two Republican congressmen, the latest in a string of criticisms the president has levied against both Sessions and the department he leads. \n \n \u201cIn this age of President Donald Trump, this expansive view of presidential power takes on added significance,\u201d said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.). \n \n Kavanaugh emphasized the importance of the separation of powers and an independent judiciary as a backstop. \n \n \u201cI\u2019ve made clear in my writings that a court order that requires a president to do something or prohibits president from doing something is the final word in our system,\u201d Kavanaugh said. \n \n \u2014 Ann E. Marimow \n \n 12:32 p.m.: Hearing resumes \n \n After a 15-minute break that lasted for about 25 minutes, Kavanaugh has taken his seat again to answer questions. \n \n 12 p.m.: Read Kavanaugh\u2019s email on Roe v. Wade \n \n In an email Kavanaugh wrote in 2003 that was made public Thursday, he argued against calling the decision \u201csettled law of the land.\u201d \n \n In his email, Kavanaugh wrote that he was \u201cnot sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe\u201d that way, noting that the Supreme Court \u201ccan always overrule its precedent.\u201d \n \n When asked about the email by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) on Thursday, Kavanaugh said he was not expressing his own views, but rather those of \u201clegal scholars.\u201d \n \n Read his email here. And head here for more on what else he has said on the issue. \n \n \u2014 Mark Berman \n \n 11:27 a.m.: Kavanaugh denies any \u201cinappropriate conversations\u201d about special counsel probe \n \n Late Wednesday night, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) questioned Kavanaugh about whether he had discussed the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election with attorneys at the law firm founded by President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Marc Kasowitz. \n \n The exchange drew intense scrutiny online, and on Thursday, Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) gave Kavanaugh an opportunity to clarify his responses to Harris, who did not disclose with whom she suspected the judge may have had such conversations. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t recall any conversations of that kind,\u201d Kavanaugh told Hatch, adding that he was not familiar with the names of all of the attorneys from the firm Kasowitz Benson Torres. \n \n Kavanaugh stressed that he had not had any \u201cinappropriate conversations\u201d or commented on his views about the legal aspects of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation that could make their way to the Supreme Court. \n \n \u201cNo hints, forecasts, previews, winks \u2014 nothing about my view as a judge or how I would rule on that or anything related to that,\u201d Kavanaugh said. \n \n \u2014 Ann E. Marimow \n \n 11:20 a.m.: Emails show more involvement with controversial judicial nominee than Kavanaugh previously suggested \n \n Kavanaugh testified in 2004 that he did not \u201cpersonally\u201d handle the nomination of a controversial George W. Bush judicial candidate: Judge William Pryor, who now sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. But emails made newly public early Thursday show more involvement than he appeared to indicate in his 2004 testimony. \n \n On Dec. 16, 2002, Kavanaugh received an email, reviewed by The Washington Post, from another White House aide with the subject line \u201cCA11\u201d \u2014 a reference to the 11th Circuit. The aide, Kyle Sampson, asked: \u201cHow did the Pryor interview go?\u201d Kavanaugh then responded: \u201cCall me.\u201d \n \n Another email from June 5, 2003 reviewed by The Post showed Kavanaugh on an email chain with a handful of other officials, alerting them to a 4 p.m. conference call to \u201cdiscuss Pryor and coordinate plans and efforts.\u201d A separate email earlier that day, on which Kavanaugh was blind carbon copied, discussed a meeting that would be held the following day to \u201cdiscuss nominee Bill Pryor\u2019s hearing\u201d the following week. \n \n Kavanaugh was nominated by Bush on April 9, 2003, and his confirmation hearing was held June 11, 2003. He was confirmed in 2005. \n \n In 2004 during his confirmation hearing for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Kavanaugh said several times under questioning by then-Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) that he had not been involved with Pryor\u2019s confirmation. \n \n \u201cI am familiar generally with Mr. Pryor, but that was not one that I worked on personally,\u201d Kavanaugh testified then. Upon further questioning, Kavanaugh said \u201cI was not involved in handling his nomination.\u201d \n \n Pryor drew controversy because he had called Roe v. Wade \u201cthe worst abomination of constitutional law in our history.\u201d As attorney general of Alabama, he had filed an amicus brief in a key Supreme Court case on gay rights, Lawrence v. Texas, that struck down state sodomy laws. Pryor wrote that states should \u201cremain free to protect the moral standards of their communities through legislation that prohibits homosexual sodomy.\u201d \n \n Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), one of the swing votes on Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court, voted against Pryor\u2019s confirmation in 2005. \n \n White House spokesman Raj Shah did not immediately return a request for comment on the newly disclosed Pryor emails. \n \n A spokesman for the Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), said some previously \u201ccommittee confidential\u201d documents are being made public as they are cleared by the Justice Department. Other records that have been requested to be made public are still being reviewed by DOJ and representatives for Bush. \n \n \u2014 Seung Min Kim \n \n 11:01 a.m.: Kavanaugh advised against calling Roe \u201csettled law,\u201d email shows \n \n While he was a White House lawyer in the Bush administration, Kavanaugh advised against referring to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Roe v. Wade as the \u201csettled law of the land,\u201d according to a 2003 email made public Thursday. \n \n \u201cI am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote after reviewing a draft of what was intended to be an op-ed in favor of a judicial nominee. \n \n Kavanaugh addressed the decision on Wednesday, refusing to say whether he believed that Roe v. Wade, the decision that guaranteed a woman\u2019s right to an abortion, was correctly decided. He also said the Supreme Court had affirmed it in subsequent cases. \n \n On Thursday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) read aloud from Kavanaugh\u2019s newly released email and said it has \u201cbeen viewed as you saying you don\u2019t think Roe is settled\u201d and asked him to explain. \n \n Kavanaugh said he was referring not to his own views, but to the \u201cviews of legal scholars.\u201d \n \n Read more here. \n \n \u2014 Mark Berman \n \n 10:45 a.m.: On cameras in the court, Kavanaugh said he is open to hearing from other justices \n \n Kavanaugh was asked about a common question regarding the court: Cameras or no cameras? \n \n The Supreme Court itself operates in a relatively anachronistic format, blocking cameras \u2014 and most other forms of technology \u2014 when cases are argued and announced. The question of whether it should remain that way has been raised over the years, including to nominees who went on to join the court. During Justice Neil M. Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation hearings last year, he said he was open to hearing more about the issue. \n \n Kavanaugh also said he was open to learning more, including from the justices already on the court to hear \u201cwhat they think about this.\u201d \n \n \u201cTo learn, if I were to be confirmed, from the experience there and to see what the experience there is like,\u201d he said. \u201cTo listen to the justices currently on the Supreme Court.\u201d \n \n \u2014 Mark Berman \n \n 10:38 a.m.: Questioning begins and is promptly interrupted by protesters \n \n An hour after the hearing got underway, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), the committee chairman, began his questioning of Kavanaugh, who had not spoken while senators debated what to do with confidential documents. \n \n A protester shouting about health care and chanting \u201cSHAME\u201d was taken outside by police as Grassley began. Then, as Kavanaugh began to speak, a male protester quickly interrupted, standing on a chair and shouting, \u201cSave Democracy, save Roe!\u201d as he was hauled out of the committee room by the Capitol Police. \n \n 10:30 a.m.: Senate Democrats in open revolt over confidential Kavanaugh documents \n \n After Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said he was willing to violate Senate rules and release confidential documents, Senate Democrats on the committee appeared in open revolt as Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) read aloud from the rules on expulsion. Raj Shah, a White House spokesman, also tweeted the rules on Thursday morning. \n \n Cornyn read aloud from rules stating that a senator who discloses \u201cthe secret or confidential business\u201d of the Senate could be \u201cliable ... to suffer expulsion.\u201d \n \n Booker responded by saying: \u201cBring the charges.\u201d His comment was echoed by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who said: \u201cApply the rule, bring the charges. All of us are ready to face that rule.\u201d \n \n \u201cThis is about the closest I\u2019ll ever have in my life to an \u2018I am Spartacus\u2019 moment,\u201d Booker said. \n \n Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) also joined in, saying: \u201cIf there\u2019s going to be some retribution against the senator from New Jersey, count me in.\u201d \n \n Their comments were echoed by Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who tweeted during the debate: \u201cI stand w/ Judiciary Committee Democrats who are well within their rights to release these very important documents that a former Kavanaugh deputy designed as \u2018committee confidential.\u2019 The American ppl deserve to know the truth about Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s record. #WhatAreTheyHiding?\u201d \n \n \u2014 Ann E. Marimow \n \n 10 a.m.: Booker says he is willing to violate Senate rules to release confidential documents \n \n The fight over access to Kavanaugh\u2019s records from his time in the Bush White House intensified in the opening moments of the hearing Thursday morning. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said he is prepared to violate Senate rules and release confidential committee documents \u2014 and to risk the consequences. \n \n Booker had questioned Kavanaugh Wednesday night about his use of the term \u201cnaked racial set-aside\u201d and said he would make public documents backing up that assertion. \n \n \u201cI openly invite and accept the consequences of releasing that email right now,\u201d Booker said. \u201cThe emails being withheld from the public have nothing to do with national security.\u201d \n \n Under the committee\u2019s rules, Booker could be expelled from the Senate for releasing such records. \n \n Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Tex.) angrily responded to Booker and referred to his potential aspirations for higher office, saying \u201crunning for president is no excuse for violating the rules of the Senate.\u201d Cornyn argued that \u201cthis is no different from the senator deciding to release classified information that is deemed classified.\u201d \n \n 9:34 a.m.: Hearing gets underway \n \n Nearly 12 hours after the first day of questioning wrapped up, Kavanaugh is back before the Senate Judiciary Committee for more questioning. Kavanaugh took his seat at 9:33 a.m., sitting alone at the witness table with a stack of papers to his left and three small water bottles to his right. \n \n Before the hearing began, the committee\u2019s Republican members were seen gathered around committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) while he spoke before they took their seats. \n \n Grassley gaveled in the hearing at 9:34 a.m. \n \n \u2014 Mark Berman \n \n 8 a.m.: What to watch for in today\u2019s hearing \n \n The third day of hearings will see Kavanaugh facing more questioning from senators. Among other things to expect and watch for: \n \n \u2022 The battle over access to records from Kavanaugh\u2019s tenure in the Bush White House is sure to resurface, with Democrats asking the committee to release additional documents that have not been disclosed to the public. \n \n Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) implied Wednesday that there is evidence in confidential Senate Judiciary Committee records that Kavanaugh in 2003 was privy to an email allegedly stolen by a former committee staffer. Kavanaugh said he never knowingly dealt with stolen records. Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) did not guarantee that those documents would become public this week, but said, \u201cwe\u2019ll try to get them.\u201d \n \n \u2022 More questions are likely about Kavanaugh\u2019s views on a host of pivotal issues, including guns, abortion, executive power, health care, affirmative action and more, as well as about his experiences on the bench and in the Bush White House. \n \n \u2022 Health care and the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act will continue to be a potent issue, particularly as a legal challenge to the law unfolds in a courtroom in Texas this week. The nominee says he can\u2019t assure senators that he would uphold the law\u2019s requirement that insurers cover people with preexisting conditions because doing so would compromise his judicial independence. Democrats say they will revisit the issue. \n \n \u2022 Loud, angry protests are likely to continue to punctuate the Senate debate about Kavanaugh\u2019s legal theory and judicial opinions. A phalanx of Capitol Police officers, dressed in dark blue and some with zip ties, have been a fixture against the back wall of the hearing room, poised to quietly haul out protesters. Capitol Police on Wednesday arrested and charged another 66 people with disorderly conduct for disrupting the hearings. \n \n \u2022 In one of the most confusing \u2014 and tense \u2014 exchanges Wednesday, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) raised the prospect without offering evidence that Kavanaugh may have spoken about the Mueller investigation with somebody at Kasowitz, Benson and Torres, a law firm that has represented Trump. It\u2019s unclear whether Harris will revisit the issue again Thursday, but the exchange went viral and quickly became one of the most talked-about moments of the Kavanaugh hearings. \n \n \n \n Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh appears during a confirmation hearing at the Hart Senate Office Building on Wednesday in Washington.

He declined to agree to Democratic calls for him to recuse himself from any cases related to the Russia investigation. And he would not say where he would come down on abortion, amid expectations among conservatives he would like to overturn Roe v. Wade. \n \n But Democrats did not walk away from a deeply divisive hearing with nothing. Top lawmakers showed vigor in cross examining Kavanaugh and by portraying him as Trump's man on the court and may have at least partly lived up to expectations of the party's fired up base for a show of backbone ahead of the mid-term elections. \n \n After emerging largely unscathed after the final round of questions from senators that stretched late into Thursday evening, Kavanaugh could take comfort in passing his biggest test. If Republicans stick together he is almost certain to be confirmed while minority Democrats face their own challenge in keeping the votes of red state senators with tough re-election races in their column. \n \n Booker's document fight \n \n Thursday's hearing featured another bitter showdown between Democrats who are furious at the failure of the White House to hand over tens of thousands of key documents on time or at all, and at restrictions on the public release of material that was made available. \n \n New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker said he was ready to risk expulsion from the Senate for making public documents pertinent Kavanaugh's time as a top White House aide to President George W. Bush, but the GOP mocked him for grandstanding ahead of a possible 2020 run -- saying it had already cleared the emails for release. \n \n In a striking political gambit, Booker, backed up by Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, released emails -- which had been designated as \"committee confidential\" -- that reference Kavanaugh's position on racial profiling and thoughts on Roe v. Wade dating from his time as a White House official under Bush. \n \n Booker, who as a potential 2020 presidential candidate had an incentive to make a splash in the hearing, said he took the action as an act of \"civil disobedience.\" \n \n \"I understand the penalty comes with potential ousting from the Senate. ... I openly invite and accept the consequences of my team releasing that email right now,\" Booker said. \n \n \"This is about the closest I'll probably ever have in my life to an 'I am Spartacus' moment,\" he added. \n \n Republican Sen John Cornyn warned Booker that releasing documents marked \"committee confidential\" would break Senate rules. \n \n \"Running for president is not an excuse for violating the rules of the Senate,\" the Texas Republican said. \n \n Later Thursday, Bill Burck, a lawyer who oversaw the process of providing Bush administration documents, undercut Booker's grand gesture, saying that the material in question had been cleared on Wednesday night at the request of the senator's staff. \n \n \"We were surprised to learn about Senator Booker's histrionics this morning because we had already told him he could use the documents publicly. In fact, we have said yes to every request made by the Senate Democrats to make documents public,\" Burck said in a statement. \n \n The office of Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, also said that senators, including Booker, were notified \"before they spoke today\" that the restrictions on the documents had been waived. \n \n Booker, however, insisted he was in the right, saying he read from the documents aloud in the hearing on Wednesday night long before they were cleared at around 4 a.m. Democrats have repeatedly complained that the White House is withholding tens of thousands of documents relevant to the nomination and wants many more that have been provided released to the public. \n \n The New Jersey senator also said he doubted Cornyn would follow through on his threats to enforce Senate discipline against him. \n \n \"I think he's like a lot of bullies are: a lot of talk, no action,\" Booker said. \n \n North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis took exception to his Democratic colleague's tactics. \n \n \"Certainly in the six hours between the time that email hit your email box and the theatrics that happened in this chamber today you could have actually found out that you didn't have to be Spartacus, you didn't have to go interact with civil disobedience, you got what you wanted,\" Tillis said. \n \n The schoolyard taunts underlined how the hearing, ahead of what appears to be Kavanaugh's likely confirmation, has become another battlefield in the vicious partisanship and complete lack of trust between the parties that is wracking Washington at a critical moment of the Trump era \n \n Booker's intervention followed a set of glowing reviews from liberals for another potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidate on the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who late Wednesday night appeared to discomfort Kavanaugh with a series of questions designed to find out with whom he had discussed special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. \n \n Harris returned to the question on Thursday evening, saying that she had been working on \"reliable information\" that Kavanaugh had a conversation about the probe with someone from Kasowitz Benson Torres, the law firm founded by Trump's personal attorney Marc Kasowitz. \n \n Kavanaugh had sidestepped the question on Wednesday, so Harris asked him again and he replied \"the answer's no.\" \n \n Earlier, the firm said in a statement to CNN there had been no such discussions. \n \n Harris did not disclose the \"reliable information\" on which she based her questions. \n \n JUST WATCHED Senator challenges Kavanaugh on Mueller probe Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Senator challenges Kavanaugh on Mueller probe 02:55 \n \n 2003 email shows Kavanaugh discussing Roe \n \n In another flashpoint development, a previously unreleased 2003 email from Kavanaugh, while he was an official in the Bush White House, shows him raising the point of whether Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that upheld the right to an abortion, was settled law of the land. \n \n In the internal White House email, obtained by CNN, Kavanaugh wrote: \"I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe v. Wade as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so.\" \n \n \"The point there is in the inferior court point,\" Kavanaugh wrote, responding to a draft op-ed that had been circulated for edits between lawmakers and White House staff. \n \n The draft, meant to be submitted under the name of \"high-profile, pro-choice\" women in support of a Bush judicial nominee, had said that \"it is widely understood accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land.\" \n \n During the confirmation hearing on Wednesday, Kavanaugh said: \"As a general proposition I understand the importance of the precedent set forth in Roe v. Wade.\" \n \n Trump said during his campaign that he would appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe. In recent years, Supreme Court nominees have gotten through their confirmation hearings by refusing to say how they would rule on what they say is a hypothetical future case on the issue. \n \n The New York Times first reported the email. \n \n Throughout the contentious hearing, now in its third day, Kavanaugh has tried to give political questions -- especially those related to Trump and his potential legal woes -- a wide berth. \n \n On Wednesday he insisted that \"no one is above the law\" but declined to say whether a sitting president must respond to a subpoena. \n \n Senate Democrats have suggested that Kavanaugh could be biased in favor of the President and worry that his views on the primacy of executive power could help Trump evade legal scrutiny. \n \n Booker warned that given Trump's frequent attacks on the Justice Department there was a \"shadow over the independence of the judiciary\" and said it was understandable for some Americans to wonder whether a nominee picked by the President would owe loyalty to him or had been nominated to shield him from a criminal investigation. \n \n \"My only loyalty is to the Constitution,\" Kavanaugh responded. \"I have made that clear, I am an independent judge.\" ||||| Tweet with a location \n \n You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Dick Durbin, D-Ill., sought a promise from Kavanaugh that he would be willing to serve as a check on the president who nominated him. \n \n \"Give us some reassurance about your commitment to the democratic institutions in this country, in the face of a president who seems prepared to cast them aside,\" Durbin said. \"Whether it's voter suppression, the role of the media \u2014 case after case, we hear this president willing to walk away from the rule of law in this country.\" \n \n \"No one is above the law,\" Kavanaugh replied. \"I've made clear in my writings that a court order that requires a president to do something or prohibits a president from doing something under the Constitution or laws of the United States is the final word in our system.\" \n \n Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, complained that the Supreme Court had been unduly deferential to President Trump this summer when it upheld his travel ban, despite what she called the administration's \"obviously bogus\" justification. She pressed Kavanaugh on when the high court should question a president's national security claims. \n \n \"National security is not a blank check for the president,\" Kavanaugh said, pointing to a number of cases in which the court had overruled the administration. \"Even in the context of wartime, the courts are not silenced. Civil liberties are not silent.\" \n \n Kavanaugh told lawmakers he is so committed to judicial independence, he stopped voting in national elections after he became a judge. \n \n Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., again asked Kavanaugh if he'd ever spoken with anyone at the law firm of Trump's personal attorney Marc Kasowitz about special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, renewing a line of questioning she'd opened Wednesday night. \n \n \"The answer is no,\" Kavanaugh said. \n \n As he's done throughout the hearing, Kavanaugh declined to answer a series of questions from Harris about issues that might come before the high court, including abortion, same-sex marriage and immigration. \n \n The White House issued a statement late Thursday praising Kavanaugh. \n \n \"Through long hours and days of questioning, Judge Kavanaugh consistently reinforced his firm belief in the bedrock principles of judicial independence and the rule of law,\" deputy press secretary Raj Shah said in the statement. \n \n Kavanaugh was asked repeatedly during the televised hearing about whether he would support opening the Supreme Court to TV cameras. He promised to keep an open mind, but said he would also want to consider the views of the eight current justices. \n \n Thursday's session began with Democrats on the committee in open revolt over the handling of documents from Kavanaugh's tenure in the George W. Bush White House. \n \n Some documents have been withheld altogether. Others have been provided to the committee on \"confidential\" terms, meaning senators can see them but they can't be made public. \n \n Democrats object that the confidential label has been applied to a wide swath of records, many of which contain no personal or sensitive information. They also complain that classification decisions were made by former President Bush's attorney, William Burck, a former deputy of Kavanaugh's. \n \n Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., released some of the confidential documents Thursday morning. Hirono also released \"confidential\" documents, drawing a stern rebuke from Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who called them \"irresponsible and outrageous.\" \n \n \"This is no different from the senator deciding to release classified information,\" Cornyn said Thursday morning. \"No senator deserves to sit on this committee, or serve in the Senate, in my view, if they decide to be a law unto themselves and willingly flout the rules of the Senate and the determination of confidentiality and classification.\" \n \n Read the documents released by Sen. Hirono here and the documents released by Sen. Leahy here. \n \n For all the theatrics on both sides, the debate over documents fizzled by Thursday afternoon, once it became clear their release had been authorized by Bush's attorney overnight. \n \n \"We cleared the documents last night shortly after Senator Booker's staff asked us to,\" Burck said in a statement. \"In fact, we have said yes to every request made by the Senate Democrats to make documents public.\" \n \n And an aide to Grassley told NPR that \"counsels for the senators who requested waivers last night/this morning for particular documents were notified that their requests had been honored beginning at around 3:50 this morning.\" \n \n But a spokesperson for Hirono said the senator was not informed that the documents released by her office Thursday morning had been approved to be made public. \n \n It is not clear whether Booker knew the documents he released had already been approved before his statements Thursday morning at the beginning of the hearing \u2014 when he said that his decision to release the documents was a form of civil disobedience and that he was aware he was risking expulsion from the Senate for making the documents public. \n \n \"Cory said this morning that he was releasing committee confidential documents, and that's exactly what he's done,\" Booker spokeswoman Kristin Lynch said in an email to NPR. \"Last night, he was admonished by Republicans for breaking the rules when he read from committee confidential documents. Cory and Senate Democrats were able to shame the committee into agreeing to make last night's documents publicly available, and Cory publicly released those documents as well as other committee confidential documents today. And he'll keep releasing them because Republicans are hiding Brett Kavanaugh's record from the American people.\" \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Jacquelyn Martin/AP Jacquelyn Martin/AP \n \n The documents released by Booker include a batch of emails concerning racial profiling, affirmative action and other race-conscious government programs. \n \n In a 2002 email, Kavanaugh wrote that security procedures adopted in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks should ultimately be race-neutral, though he acknowledged that developing such procedures could take time. Others in the White House suggested racial profiling might be legally justified if it enhanced security. \n \n In a 2001 email, Kavanaugh addressed a legal challenge to an affirmative action program within the Department of Transportation. \n \n \"The fundamental problem in this case is that these DOT regulations use a lot of legalisms and disguises to mask what in reality is a naked racial set-aside,\" he wrote. \n \n Kavanaugh had sidestepped questions from Booker on Wednesday night about the circumstances in which government can and cannot use race-conscious measures to address past discrimination. \n \n He conceded that hopes he expressed nearly two decades ago for a color-blind society have not been fulfilled. \n \n \"We see on an all-too-common basis that racism still exists in the United States of America,\" Kavanaugh said. \"Our long march to racial equality is not over.\" \n \n Separately, The New York Times reported on leaked emails from the \"confidential\" file. One is an email drafted by Kavanaugh in 2003, in which he questioned whether the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion should be described as \"settled law of the land.\" \n \n Pressed on that email by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., on Thursday, Kavanaugh explained he was simply summarizing views of legal scholars and not offering his own view. \n \n On Wednesday, Kavanaugh said he understands the weight that many people attach to Roe. But he declined to say whether that case was properly decided. \n \n Throughout the hearing, Kavanaugh has avoided commenting on Trump's behavior, despite urging from Senate Democrats. \n \n \"I'm not going to get within three zip codes of a political controversy,\" he said Thursday, when Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., asked him about Trump's attacks on judges, including Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. \n \n \"I've spoken about my respect and appreciation for the eight justices on the Supreme Court,\" Kavanaugh said. \"I know they're all dedicated public servants who have given a great deal to this country.\" \n \n Barring surprises, Kavanaugh appears likely to win confirmation in time to take his place alongside those eight justices when the Supreme Court begins its fall term next month. \n \n Not seeing the video?

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Day three of the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearing has opened with a bang: Democratic Sen. Cory Booker says he has ordered his staff to release a Kavanaugh email even though it's supposed to remain under wraps. It's not clear yet what the email says, but NBC News reports that it concerns racial profiling. Booker called his act one of civil disobedience, reports NPR. \"I openly invite and accept the consequences,\" he said, per CNN. \"The penalty comes with potential ousting from the Senate.\" Indeed, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn read aloud rules stating that a senator who divulges \"the secret or confidential business\" of the Senate faces expulsion, reports the Washington Post. \"Bring the charges,\" said Booker. \"All of us are ready to face that rule,\" added fellow Democrat Richard Blumenthal. Democrats have been chafing that too many of Kavanaugh's documents are either being withheld or deemed off limits for the hearing. Booker's stand comes after the New York Times obtained some of those off-limits emails. In one from 2003, when Kavanaugh was working in the White House of George W. Bush, he objects to language that Roe v. Wade is \"settled law.\" He was going over a draft opinion stating that \"it is widely accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land,\" but he took exception to the phrase. \"I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so,\" he wrote at the time. As the Times notes, Kavanaugh didn't state his personal opinion on the matter.",

After getting a death threat from the jihadist website RevolutionMuslim.com, the show pulled the prophet Mohammed out of this week's episode, bleeping out all mention of his name, putting \u201ccensored\u201d banners over parts of the episode and, where necessary, replacing him with Santa Claus in a bear suit, the Huffington Post reports. Here's the deal: last week's episode (which you can see a clip of here) mocked the taboo against showing the prophet Mohammed, having him show up first hidden inside a U-Haul, and then inside a bear costume. This week's episode was to continue that story. It's unclear whether the extra censorship is intended to appease the irony-challenged folks at RevolutionMuslim or mock them. South Park, incidentally, has tackled the issue before, and even depicted Mohammed on screen once with impunity.",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 The brouhaha over Family Guy's plan to air an image of the prophet Muhammad has turned into a real-life soap opera, according to a report in the Los Angeles Times. Viewers of the show's third season, which aired on Fox last night, were outraged when the network announced that it would ban the episode because of the image's association with the 9/11 attacks. Viewers of the second season, which aired in October, were even more outraged when the network said it would ban the episode because of the image's association with al-Qaeda. The show's creator, Seth MacFarlane, has defended the decision to air the image of the prophet, saying in a statement that he \"deeply respects and admires the religious beliefs of many\" and that \"freedom of expression is one of the greatest freedoms in the world.\" But critics say MacFarlane has gone too far in depicting the prophet as a terrorist, and that the episode that aired last night, in which the show's two main characters, Cartman and Kyle, went on a wild chase after the network threatened to ban the episode, was inappropriate.",

    "document": "The number of donors who raise big money for President Barack Obama jumped in the last three months as he builds a war chest for what will likely be the costliest presidential election ever. \n \n At least 41 people have raised at least half a million dollars for the president, compared to 27 in Obama's first report, according to an analysis of campaign data released Friday. \n \n The big donors, known as \"bundlers,\" are typically well-connected people who pledge to gather tens of thousands of dollars for a candidate. \n \n Former Goldman Sachs executive Jon Corzine and Dreamworks Animation chief executive executive Jeffrey Katzenberg are on Obama's elite list and raised $500,000 or more. \n \n The president's campaign finance report shows he can still pull in major cash despite a stagnant economy, dipping approval ratings and grumblings among some liberal supporters that he has not done enough for their cause. \n \n While still keeping ties to his famed small donor operation, Obama is relying heavily on major donors early on to finance a campaign that is likely to break records in spending, according to Anthony Corrado, a campaign finance expert at Colby College in Maine. \n \n \"The emphasis has been on doing larger dollar fundraising events particularly asking for $2,500,\" Corrado said. \"Events like this help him to raise substantial amounts of money for the campaign allowing him to exceed his pace for 2007.\" \n \n GOP ahead in polls \n \n Obama and the Democratic National Committee have raised more than $150 million so far for his bid for a second term, far outstripping Obama's Republican rivals. \n \n But fundraising prowess doesn't guarantee victory for the incumbent, who is fighting for re-election amid a economic stagnation and high unemployment. \n \n Opinion polls show that Obama will have a tough time winning re-election next year. A Gallup poll released on Friday showed that U.S. registered voters, by 46 percent to 38 percent, are more likely to vote for an unnamed Republican presidential candidate than for Obama in 2012. Obama recently called himself the \"underdog\" in the race. \n \n Bundlers raised about a third of Obama's war chest so far. \n \n Earlier on Friday, Republican Mitt Romney posted $14 million for the quarter, second to fellow Republican Texas Governor Rick Perry's $17 million. Obama's comparable fundraising figure for the three months was $43 million. \n \n Obama voluntarily releases a list of bundlers. No other major candidate has done so. \n \n The president regularly brings in more than $1 million in a single evening of fundraising, as supporters donate the legal maximum of $35,800 to his campaign and the Democratic party for the chance to have dinner and take a picture with the president. \n \n UBS executive Robert Wolf and hedge fund executive Orin Kramer are also big Obama fundraisers. \n \n 'Doing well with small donors' \n \n At least 40 percent of all the money raised by the Obama campaign and the Democratic National Committee last quarter came from those giving in increments of $200 or less. \n \n The Obama campaign has been touting its connections to mainstream Americans who send smaller checks, calling itself a grassroots effort. \n \n \"They are still doing well with small donors,\" said Darrell West, director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution, a thank tank. \n \n The campaign said that in the third quarter about 600,000 people donated to the campaign. \n \n Much has been made of dipping support among Wall Street for Obama. Some financial executives, including hedge fund managers, have complained about Obama's tax and financial regulation policies and his comments about the wealthy, at times calling them \"fat cats.\" \n \n In the second quarter, more Wall Street money did flow to Romney, who has deep ties there. Still, Obama boosted the number of bundlers with Wall Street ties in that period. \n \n The Republican candidates' reports, due Saturday, offer the first broad look at their financial health. \n \n They are the first official tallies of donations and expenses for contenders Perry, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman and businessman Herman Cain, who said he raised $2.8 million this quarter. \n \n Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, had nearly $15 million on hand in addition to the roughly $14 million in contributions during the July-September period that he reported Friday. \n \n Perry, who briefly surged to the top of the Republican presidential field this summer, has roughly the same in the bank. \n \n Not counting major support from Republican-leaning super political action committees, the virtual tie between Romney and Perry for cash on hand means the two have similar amounts to spend on ads and travel just months before heading into key primary states. \n \n Perry is expected to dig into his campaign funds to buy TV ads to Romney's record on health care, abortion, gay rights and job creation. His campaign suggested this week that the moment for a barrage of attack ads was near. \n \n Romney, the former governor of a predominantly Democratic state, has been attacked for his shifting positions on social issues that are held dear by conservative voters who dominate the Republican primary season. ||||| It is no secret that the relationship between President Obama and Wall Street has chilled. A striking measure of that is the latest campaign finance reports. \n \n Mitt Romney has raised far more money than Mr. Obama this year from the firms that have been among Wall Street\u2019s top sources of donations for the two candidates. \n \n That gap underscores the growing alienation from Mr. Obama among many rank-and-file financial professionals and Mr. Romney\u2019s aggressive and successful efforts to woo them. \n \n The imbalance exists at large investment banks and hedge funds, private equity firms and commercial banks, according to a New York Times analysis of the firms that accounted for the most campaign contributions from the industry to Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama in 2008, based on data from the Federal Election Commission and the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. \n \n It could widen as Mr. Obama, seeking to harness anger over growing income inequality, escalates his criticism of the industry, after a year spent trying to smooth ties bruised by efforts to impose tougher regulations. \n \n Since this spring, Mr. Romney has raised $1.5 million from employees of firms like Morgan Stanley; Highbridge Capital Management, a hedge fund; and Blackstone, a private equity firm. Mr. Obama has raised just over $270,000 from firms that were among his leading sources of campaign cash in 2008. \n \n Employees of Goldman Sachs, who in the 2008 campaign gave Mr. Obama over $1 million \u2014 more than donors from any other private employer in the country \u2014 have given him about $45,000 this year. Mr. Romney has raised about $350,000 from the firm\u2019s employees. \n \n Those figures do not account for all Wall Street giving, nor for the full force of each candidate\u2019s robust network of Wall Street \u201cbundlers,\u201d wealthy individuals who raise money from friends, family members and business associates. And Mr. Obama continues to dominate Mr. Romney \u2014 and the rest of the Republican field \u2014 in overall fund-raising. He has raised close to $100 million so far this year for his campaign, three times more than Mr. Romney, as well as $65 million for the Democratic National Committee. \n \n The gap in Wall Street giving to Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney underscores disenchantment with Mr. Obama in the industry and the challenges both candidates will face in grappling with public anger about the financial world. \n \n For much of the last year, aides to Mr. Obama have sought to mollify Wall Street executives still bristling over the president\u2019s criticisms of their profits and bonuses, while defending the administration\u2019s program of tougher oversight and regulation as both necessary and beneficial to the industry in the long term. \n \n But with Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor who once ran the private equity firm Bain Capital, the candidate many in Mr. Obama\u2019s camp believe is his most likely Republican opponent next fall, Mr. Obama\u2019s campaign appears to sense an opportunity to harness public resentment over an industry that has largely thrived while the rest of the economy has not. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that Governor Romney has raised money off of his belief that Wall Street should be allowed to write its own rules again by repealing Wall Street reform,\u201d said Ben LaBolt, an Obama campaign spokesman. \u201cThe president put in place protections to ensure that the financial crisis is not repeated and that unacceptable risks aren\u2019t taken with Americans\u2019 life savings.\u201d \n \n For his part, Mr. Romney is now pitching himself as the turnaround expert for an ailing national economy. He has personally wooed major Wall Street donors, successfully recruiting several senior financial executives poised to back Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey had he opted for a White House bid. \n \n But anger at big banks \u2014 manifested by the growing Occupy Wall Street protests in New York City and elsewhere \u2014 is palpable enough that Mr. Romney must avoid being seen as a friend of an industry that many Americans blame for onerous bank fees and underwater mortgages.",

    "document": "But Lerner should have been gone shortly after this scandal first unraveled in the press. Not only is she the person who was in charge of the group that wrongly targeted conservatives, she dishonestly testified that she didn\u2019t know about the targeting until 2012, when the inspector general found she knew as early as 2011. She\u2019s the person who told a conference call of reporters, \u201cI\u2019m not that good at math,\u201d even though she\u2019s a manager in an agency that\u2019s at bottom all about math. \n \n What I think is even more politically and morally suspect \u2013 and has gotten very little attention -- Lerner actually presided over the bizarre, bumbling rollout of the story, by planting a question about the controversy with an attorney at an American Bar Association conference. According to Morgan Lewis tax lawyer Celia Roady, Lerner herself asked that Roady inquire about whether the IRS had targeted conservative groups. That led to Lerner\u2019s public apology \u2013 and the scandal swirling around the White House, which found itself surprised by the sudden disclosure. \n \n The invaluable tax-policy expert David Cay Johnston called for Lerner\u2019s firing a week ago \u2013 and that was even before there was proof that she had set up the question at the ABA conference. ||||| Lois Lerner, the IRS staffer who is under fire for her role in the agency\u2019s targeting of conservative groups, has been placed on administrative leave, according to congressional aides. \n \n \n \n She will still be paid while on leave, a congressional aide said, as required under civil service rules. \n \n Lerner, who heads an IRS division that oversees tax-exempt groups, first disclosed the extra scrutiny the agency gave to Tea Party groups almost two weeks ago when answering a planted question at a Washington legal conference. \n \n Since then, lawmakers from across the political spectrum have said that they believe Lerner misled them and have called for her dismissal. \n \n \n \n Sen. Chuck Grassley (Iowa), a senior Republican on the Finance Committee, said in a Thursday statement that new acting IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel had asked Lerner to resign \u2014 and that Lerner was only placed on leave after she declined that request. Aides on Capitol Hill confirmed that Lerner had refused to resign. \n \n In her first public appearance since the disclosure, Lerner on Wednesday invoked her Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination at a House Oversight hearing. \n \n \n \n ADVERTISEMENT \n \n The IRS announced in an internal memo circulated to the media that Ken Corbin will be taking over as the acting director of the tax-exempt organizations division. Corbin, a 25-year veteran at the IRS, has been deputy director in a division that processed millions of tax returns a year. \n \n Lerner\u2019s move to administrative leave comes after President Obama pushed out acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller over his role in the targeting. Werfel, formerly a senior official at the Office of Management and Budget, took over as acting commissioner on Wednesday. \n \n \n \n The IRS also announced after the controversy broke that Joseph Grant, Lerner\u2019s boss at the agency, will retire in early June. \n \n \n \n Lerner will likely have to make her way back to Capitol Hill in the coming weeks, after House Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) concluded that she waved her rights against self-incrimination by defending herself in an opening statement at Wednesday's hearing. \n \n \n \n Sens. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) on Thursday became the latest prominent lawmakers to call for Lerner to be removed, in a letter to Werfel made public shortly before news of Lerner\u2019s administrative leave broke. \n \n \n \n Reps. Sandy Levin (D-Mich.), Joe Crowley (D-N.Y) and Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) have also called for Lerner to be pushed out. \n \n \"In naming Ken Corbin as acting director to replace Lois Lerner, the administration has taken a strong step to address serious mistakes made by the IRS Exempt Organization Division,\" Levin said in a statement. \"This and further corrective action are vital in restoring the confidence of the American people.\" \n \n \n \n According to a Treasury audit, Lerner found out in June 2011 that IRS staffers were giving extra scrutiny to conservative groups seeking tax-exempt 501(c)(4) status by searching for organizations with names like \u201cTea Party\u201d and \u201cpatriots.\u201d \n \n \n \n Lerner immediately ordered that the criteria targeting conservative groups be changed, but staffers in a Cincinnati office eventually once again implemented more political screening criteria, according to the audit. \n \n \n \n \u201cI have not done anything wrong. I have not broken any laws. I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations, and I have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee,\u201d Lerner told House Oversight on Wednesday. \n \n \n \n \u201cBecause I'm asserting my right not to testify, I know that some people will assume that I've done something wrong. I have not.\u201d \n \n \n \n The audit, from Treasury\u2019s inspector general for tax administration, also found that some groups waited months, even years, for their tax-exempt applications to be approved. \n \n \n \n National Review first reported that Lerner was being placed on administrative leave. \n \n The publication also reported late Thursday that letters suggest Lerner was directly involved in the agency\u2019s targeting of conservative groups more than nine months after she first learned of the activity. \n \n \u2014 This story was updated at 7:34 p.m. \n \n",

    "document": "CLOSE Doctors at a Baltimore hospital have performed the world's most extensive penis transplant, this one also involving the scrotum and part of the abdominal wall. (April 23) AP \n \n Surgeons at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine announced Monday that they have performed the first total penis and scrotum transplant on an American military veteran. (Photo: Getty Images) \n \n A U.S. serviceman severely injured several years ago in an IED blast in Afghanistan has received the world's first total penis and scrotum transplant, surgeons at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine announced Monday. \n \n The man, whose identity was not released, is recovering well and expected to regain both urinary and sexual function, Richard Redett, who led the transplant team, said at a Monday telephone news conference. \n \n The patient did not receive testicles from his donor to avoid the ethical issues that might ensue if he later had children, said Damon Cooney, another transplant team member. The testicles would have contained sperm from the recently deceased donor. \n \n The donor was not identified, nor was his cause of death, but in a statement, his family praised the sergeant\u2019s service to his country and noted the donor family includes a number of veterans. \n \n \u201cWe are so thankful to say that our loved one would be proud and honored to know he provided such a special gift to you,\u201d said the statement, read by Alexandra Glazier, president and CEO of New England Donor Services, which arranged for the donation. \u201cWe hope you can return to better health very soon and we continue to wish you a speedy recovery.\u201d \n \n Two years ago, surgeons at Massachusetts General Hospital performed a more limited transplant on a penile cancer patient. That patient, Thomas Manning, continues to do well, though his sexual function hasn\u2019t fully recovered yet, said Curtis Cetrulo, who runs the reconstructive transplantation program at Massachusetts General. The hospital has yet to conduct another penile transplant, as it awaits funding and other logistical issues, he said. \n \n There have also been several successful penile transplants in South Africa, as well as an unsuccessful one in China. \n \n The Johns Hopkins surgery, performed in a 14-hour procedure in late March, was the most extensive yet, involving more tissue than has been previously transplanted, the surgeons said. \n \n In addition to a large skin graft covering part of the sergeant\u2019s abdomen, penis and scrotum, surgeons connected three arteries, four veins and two nerves to provide blood flow and sensation to the donated tissue. His internal organs were not severely damaged by the blast. \n \n Redett said he expects the patient will regain the ability to urinate by the time he leaves the hospital later this week. It will take about six months for the nerves to regrow enough to restore sexual function and sensation, but Redett said he is optimistic that will take place. \n \n Johns Hopkins covered the cost of the procedure, and hopes to complete more in the near future, said W. P. Andrew Lee, who directs the hospital\u2019s Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. \n \n The hospital does not plan to use the procedure for gender reassignment surgery, he said. \n \n Once it becomes more routine, penile transplantation is likely to cost about the same as a liver transplant, said L. Scott Levin, chairman of orthopedic surgery and a professor of plastic surgery at Penn Medicine. (One recent estimate puts the total cost of a liver transplant in the United States above $800,000.) It is still an open question who will pay for such procedures, Levin said. \n \n Another major issue in transplantation is rejection. The recipient\u2019s body may reject the donated tissue at any time, so the Johns Hopkins patient will have to be on continuous therapy to tamp down his immune system, said Gerald Brandacher, who handled the immune aspects of the Johns Hopkins transplant. \n \n To reduce the risk of rejection, the patient was also infused with bone marrow from the donor. This approach has been used in eight other patients who received transplants, such as arms, that were transformative but not lifesaving. Balancing the donor\u2019s bone marrow with the recipient\u2019s allows the patient to take only one low-dose medication a day instead of the three typically taken by transplant patients, Brandacher said. \n \n Injuries that affect sexual and urinary function can be devastating to a person\u2019s identity, self-esteem and intimate relationships, said Lee, whose department has been preparing for penile transplantations since 2013. \n \n \u201cWe believe that genital-urinary transplantation can help those warriors with missing genitalia, just as hand and arm transplants transformed the lives of amputees,\u201d he said. \n \n At Massachusetts General, publicity surrounding the penile transplant encouraged other patients with genitourinary tissue damage to seek care. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019ve had many people who are really despondent come out of the shadows and get worked up,\u201d Cetrulo said. \n \n Even if they weren\u2019t transplant candidates they have now been helped in other ways, Cetrulo said, noting many people with these conditions consider suicide, and suffer even more emotional pain than people in need of arm or face transplants. \n \n Hopefully, the Johns Hopkins' patient will inspire others to seek help, Cetrulo said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the most incredible and important contributions of this case, not only to this individual whose life has probably been saved.\u201d \n \n Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2vDM2Nt ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A veteran who lost his genitals from a blast in Afghanistan has received the world's most extensive penis transplant, and doctors said Monday he is recovering well and expected to leave the hospital this week. \n \n Saying they wanted to address \"an unspoken injury of war,\" Johns Hopkins University surgeons rebuilt the man's entire pelvic region \u2014 transplanting a penis, scrotum and part of the abdominal wall from a deceased donor \u2014 in a highly experimental 14-hour operation last month. \n \n Such transplants \"can help those warriors with missing genitalia just as hand and arm transplant transformed the lives of amputees,\" Dr. W.P. Andrew Lee, Hopkins' chairman of plastic and reconstructive surgery, told reporters Monday. \n \n The patient, who asked to remain anonymous, is expected to recover urinary and, eventually, sexual function. \n \n The scrotum transplant did not include the donor's testicles, meaning reproduction won't be possible. \"We just felt there were too many unanswered ethical questions\" with that extra step, said Hopkins' Dr. Damon Cooney. \n \n Three other successful penis transplants have been reported, two in South Africa and one in 2016 at Massachusetts General Hospital. Those transplants involved only the penis, not extensive surrounding tissue that made this transplant much more complex. \n \n The loss of a penis, whether from cancer, accident or war injury, is emotionally traumatic, affecting urination, sexual intimacy and the ability to conceive a child. Many patients suffer in silence because of the stigma their injuries sometimes carry. \n \n Doctors sometimes reconstruct the form of a penis from a patient's own skin, usually to treat congenital abnormalities or during transgender surgery. That requires using implants to achieve erection. \n \n For a functional penis transplant, surgeons must connect tiny nerves and blood vessels. Candidates face some serious risks, including rejection of the tissue and side effects from anti-rejection drugs that must be taken for life. \n \n But penis transplants have generated intense interest among veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan, and a few years ago Hopkins surgeons began planning and rehearsing how to perform such a complex operation in patients with widespread tissue damage. The Department of Defense Trauma Registry has recorded 1,367 male service members who survived with genitourinary injuries between 2001 and 2013. It's not clear how many victims lost all or part of the penis. \n \n Hopkins is screening additional veterans to see if they are good candidates for this type of reconstructive transplant. Finding donors is an additional hurdle: In the U.S., people or their families who agree to donate organs such as the heart or lung must be asked separately about also donating a penis, hand, face or other body part. \n \n The Hopkins patient received an extra experimental step, an infusion of bone marrow from his donor that research suggests may help a recipient's immune system better tolerate a transplant. Surgeons said that is enabling the veteran to take one anti-rejection drug instead of several. \n \n In a statement from Hopkins, the patient was quoted as saying: \"When I first woke up, I felt finally more normal.\" \n \n ___ \n \n The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Three other people were also injured in the incident. \n \n Melquan was taken to the Children's Hospital of Georgia where he was pronounced dead at 9:56 p.m. His body will be taken to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation lab for an autopsy Tuesday. \n \n Don Clark, a Robinson family friend and Melquan's former coach, said the child's parents are trying to go through the grieving process. Melquan was their firstborn and one of three children. \n \n \"They're definitely upset over the fact of how could this happen, with the fact that there were so many children,\" Clark said. \"You can play the what ifs in many different scenarios and it will never get any better. The fact that this situation happened with so many kids out here, it's heartbreaking.\" \n \n Clark said Melquan was very protective of his siblings and loved his family, which makes the situation that much tougher. Clark feels that it might be hard for his siblings to deal with the loss of their brother because of how young they are. \n \n According to a statement from the city of Augusta, which owns and operates the community center and athletic complex, three other people were injured in the accident. Two were juveniles and the other was an adult, according to the Richmond County Sheriff's Office. \n \n \"Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of all involved in this accident,\" Mayor Hardie Davis said in a statement. \"We ask Augustans to stand together to extend our condolences and embrace the family of Melquan Kwame Robinson with love during this sudden and unexpected loss.\" \n \n Clark praised the courage shown by the two other children who were injured trying to save their friend. Their conditions were not available Tuesday night. \n \n \"The friends, the way they responded, what motivates a young boy that young to jump into action and help their friend out,\" Clark said. \"Those are the two young boys that are in the hospital right now because they were trying to help out a friend.\" \n \n Clark said he will remember Melquan's smile. Melquan was energetic, very athletic and very passionate about playing football and sports, according to Clark. He said Melquan wanted to be a professional athlete when he grew up. \n \n Melquan was a member of the Trinity Elite Titans football team, which issued a statement on Facebook: \"Good morning everyone, this is a sad moment for our Trinity Elite Titans family......we are still in disbelief. We are sending our prayers and love out to the family of our football player, #MelquanKwameRobinson#, who has gone to rest with the Lord. One solider gone too soon.........you will be truly missed!!!!\" \n \n Although the family is grieving, Clark wanted to remind people that this is affecting friends, teammates and coaches of Melquan. He hopes the city and the community are able to come together for the family and friends. \n \n \"This is exactly one of those tests, that as a city and a community, we all need to stand up and move forward toward the challenge,\" Clark said. \n \n According to a sheriff's office report, a deputy who responded to the scene performed chest compression on Melquan about 9 p.m. Another deputy stated in the report that he was told the child had been electrocuted by the outfield fence. After a few rounds of chest compressions, Melquan coughed and was turned to his left side. A deputy checked his pulse but none was found, and chest compressions were continued, the report states. \n \n A Gold Cross ambulance unit arrived about 9:16 p.m. and loaded Melquan onto a stretcher. Another ambulance arrived to transport a second victim, according to the incident report, which stated that the child was with Melquan and was injured when he tried to pull his friend down from the fence. \n \n A third victim told deputies that he and Melquan were throwing a football and it went over the fence. Melquan climbed the fence to get the ball and when he came back over, he was electrocuted, the incident report states. He tried to pull Melquan from the fence and he too was injured, according to the incident report. \n \n Bowen said his office, the sheriff's office and the city will each conduct investigations. Bowen will primarily focus on the death, while the city will look into how the live electrical wire happened. \n \n Georgia Power released a statement saying it will work with local officials as they conduct the investigation. \n \n \"Georgia Power's condolences and sympathies are with the individuals and their families following last night's tragic event at Fleming Athletic Complex,\" the statement says. \"Our preliminary investigation indicates that Georgia Power does not control or maintain the voltage that energized the fences at the complex.\" \n \n Melquan was a seventh-grader at Morgan Road Middle School, according to Kaden Jacobs, the Richmond County school system's director of communications. \n \n \"Our thoughts are with the family during this difficult time,\" Jacobs said. \"We have provided additional support to Morgan Road Middle School for students and staff.\" \n \n All football activities have been canceled for the rest of the week at Fleming Park, according to a spokesperson for the complex. \n \n Clark said more details will be provided in the future on how the community can help. \n \n \"We lost a future leader,\" he said. \"We lost a future athlete.

    "document": "Could Hawaii Become A Same-Sex Wedding Destination? \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption iStockphoto iStockphoto \n \n Starting Monday, same-sex marriage is legal in Hawaii. The state has long been a destination for weddings and honeymoons. And now state officials, as well as hotels and restaurants, are hoping the latest marriage-equality law will spur a new market for wedding tourism. \n \n Wedding planner Keane Akao is showing off a secluded beach wedding site, one of several on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. \n \n \"You can use the beach for pictures,\" he tells a couple, \"and this is actually called Secret Beach.\" \n \n His company, Perfectly Planned Hawaii, offers wedding planning for same-sex couples. Swaying palm trees and clear blue water make for a dream ceremony. \n \n Akao started his company with his business partner less than six months ago, just before Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie called for a special session to debate same-sex marriage. \n \n \"People now can look at Hawaii as a destination to have their marriage done legally,\" says Akao, \"and for it to be recognized by the federal government, no matter what state they may live in.\" \n \n He has received more than two-dozen confirmations since the bill passed last month. \n \n One couple planning to marry in the islands is Cira Abiseid and Cyrilla Owle. Last month, they celebrated their union in a ceremony with family and friends at home in Conway, Ark. But their home state doesn't recognize same-sex marriage, so Owle says they're going to Hawaii to make it official. \n \n \"I think there's two things that came in effect when planning where we wanted to be married,\" says Owle. \"First, like any couple, we wanted to see where we wanted to go for our honeymoon. So who doesn't want to go to Hawaii for their honeymoon, right? And the second reason was, where could we get a license?\" \n \n \"Same-sex couples will be attracted to Hawaii for the same reasons that opposite-sex couples are attracted to Hawaii,\" says Sumner La Croix, an economist at the University of Hawaii. \"It's the great weather, it's the warm water, it's the beautiful scenery. And it's also the aloha spirit.\" \n \n La Croix estimates that over the next three years, gay marriage will boost tourism in Hawaii by $217 million. Unlike some other states with marriage equality laws, Hawaii already has a booming tourism industry. La Croix believes that gives Hawaii an advantage. \n \n \"The machinery of marriage is already in place here. There are hotels that are in the marriage business,\" he says. \"They're used to catering to couples who are honeymooning or want to get married or are celebrating a marriage. There are wedding photographers. There are caterers. There's a large number of firms that are specialized in the marriage business.\" \n \n In Hawaii, tourism is a $14 billion industry. Now, the island chain is positioning itself for a spike in visitors \u2014 among them, Honolulu-based hotel chain Aqua Hospitality. It already offers LGBT travel deals, including the \"out and proud\" package and the \"civil unions romance special.\" \n \n Bigger beachfront resorts are also getting in on the action. The Sheraton Waikiki is the only hotel on Oahu providing on-site marriage licenses. General Manager Kelly Sanders says now the hotel is running a new ad campaign in mainland LGBT publications. \n \n \"Yes, there's a revenue opportunity,\" says Sanders. \"There's an opportunity for all of us to really have that great success, but in my mind it's something that should have happened already. And so it's just now being able to really open all of our arms as wide as they can be and say welcome.\" \n \n It was Hawaii that back in 1991 touched off the national conversation about same-sex marriage. Then, three couples sued to force the state to issue them marriage licenses. Now, more than two decades later, Hawaii is the latest state to recognize marriage equality. ||||| Six couples tied the knot early Monday, shortly after midnight, when a new law allowing same-sex couples to marry took effect. \n \n A Waikiki resort was hosting mass ceremonies for anyone wanting to sign up, while a group of clergy who pushed for the new law planned to host a wedding for an openly gay Unitarian minister at a church near downtown Honolulu. \n \n Hawaii's marriage laws allow couples to register for a license and be married the same day, a process conducive for tourists only in the state a short time. \n \n Couples can sign up for a license online, then be verified by any license agent throughout the state. \n \n THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below. \n \n The first couples are starting to take advantage of Hawaii's newfound aloha for gay weddings. \n \n Dozens of couples were expected to start tying the knot early Monday, moments after midnight, when a new law allowing same couples to marry takes effect in the state. \n \n Couples at the Sheraton Waikiki began filling out license applications a few minutes after midnight, as license agents huddled around four laptops in a conference room adjacent to a 30th floor lounge where the ceremonies were set to take place. \n \n Guests sipped champagne, dined on appetizers, listened to piano music and took pictures with each of seven cakes on display for the occasion, one for each of the first six couples getting married and a three-tiered centerpiece cake adorned with pink and white roses. \n \n \"Next,\" exclaimed Ethan Wung after being the first of the group to complete the license application with his groom, Keola Akana. \n \n Wung said he and Akana were getting married after entering into a civil union last year so they could receive federal benefits. \n \n Organizers were waiting for each of the first six couples to finish their paperwork before starting the ceremony. \n \n The resort was hosting mass ceremonies for anyone wanting to sign up, while a group of clergy who pushed for the new law planned to host a wedding for an openly gay Unitarian minister at a church near downtown Honolulu. \n \n \"It's just exciting and historic and we wanted to be a part of it,\" Maria Gallo, a Honolulu resident who planned to marry her partner, Beth Creary, said earlier. \n \n \"This is like a confirmation with a group of people here who are sharing our joy,\" she said. \n \n Hawaii's marriage laws allow couples to register for a license and be married the same day, a process conducive for tourists to hold ceremonies here. \n \n Couples can sign up for a license online, then be verified by any license agent throughout the state. Agents have set up shop throughout the islands, from resorts on Maui and the Big Island to hard-to-reach places on Kauai. \n \n For those wanting to get licenses in person, Hawaii's Health Department planned to open its doors at 8 a.m. local time Monday morning. \n \n \"We started this battle 23 years ago and we get to finish it tonight,\" said Michael Golojuch Jr., chairman on Honolulu Pride and one of the organizers of the midnight weddings at the Sheraton. \n \n Hawaii is often credited with starting the national gay marriage discussion, when couples applying for a marriage license led to a court fight the eventually helped prompt Congress to pass the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996. Part of the law was struck down earlier this year by the U.S. Supreme Court. \n \n Golojuch said the weddings will touch Hawaii in a good way and that businesses have begun to think about how to embrace the gay community. \n \n \"They opened up their doors to us, their hearts to us,\" Golojuch said. \"That's what we're seeing with a lot of the business community that understands that $217 million is what our economy needs to keep on going.\" \n \n An estimate from a University of Hawaii researcher says Hawaii will get a $217 million tourism boost over the next three years as a result of gay marriage. \n \n Hawaii's Legislature _ overwhelmingly comprised of Democrats _ passed the law last month during a special session. Gov. Neil Abercrombie called for the special session after the U.S. Supreme Court rulings. \n \n ___ \n \n Oskar Garcia can be reached on Twitter at http://twitter.com/oskargarcia",

Indeed, Hawaii played a key role in the early gay marriage debate: When same-sex Hawaiian couples sought marriage licenses in the 1990s, a court battle ensued, resulting in the Defense of Marriage Act. In the state, couples can apply for a marriage license and get married in the same day. That could be a boon for destination weddings in a state already well-equipped for tourist ceremonies. A University of Hawaii researcher says the state could see a $217 million increase in tourism thanks to the process.

    "document": "JERUSALEM \u2014 New archaeological tests have confirmed that the site many Christians believe to be the tomb of Jesus Christ dates back 1,700 years to A.D. 325, the same era when the Romans first identified the place as holy. \n \n With invasions, fires and even earthquakes occurring at Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre over the centuries, historians had questioned whether the tomb had been destroyed or moved. \n \n To date the tomb, known as the Holy Edicule, conservators from the National Technical University of Athens looked at radioactive elements in the architectural glue that fit it together. They also used ground-penetrating radar and laser scanning. \n \n Play Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Embed TODAY goes inside Church of the Holy Sepulchre: Is it Jesus' tomb? 3:43 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \n \n The tomb is the size of a coat closet, and was open for just 60 hours while restoration work was also carried out. \n \n The results of the tests were first reported Tuesday by National Geographic. \n \n \"Scientists and archaeologists are very excited about this because, what it does is, it corroborates our historical accounts,\" said National Geographic archaeology writer Kristin Romey, who was on site during the nine-month renovation project. \n \n Experts believe the site was identified around A.D. 325 A.D., when the Roman emperor Constantine the Great came to the city with his team to locate places associated with the life of Jesus. \n \n A holy fire ceremony is held at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem on April 15. Atef Safadi / EPA file \n \n The Romans are said to have torn down a temple in Jerusalem where they found the cave that they believed to be his burial site. They then built a shrine and a church around that site. \n \n Three different Christian denominations \u2014 Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox and Armenian Orthodox \u2014 share custody over the church, and there have been turf wars and brawls in the past over the management of the site. \n \n Even the restoration took decades to settle. In 1959, the various denominations agreed to conserve the edicule, but it took until 2016 to actually agree on a plan for the restoration, National Geographic archaeologist-in-residence Fredrik Hiebert said. \n \n The same Greek team that restored the Acropolis in Athens was chosen to carry out the project. \n \n Archaeologists believe there may be more surprises to come at the site. \n \n \u201cThere is so much information in the data that was collected by the restorers during the conservation project,\u201d Hiebert said. \u201cThere are many, many stories still to be told.\u201d ||||| Over the centuries, Jerusalem\u2019s Church of the Holy Sepulchre has suffered violent attacks, fires, and earthquakes. It was totally destroyed in 1009 and subsequently rebuilt, leading modern scholars to question whether it could possibly be the site identified as the burial place of Christ by a delegation sent from Rome some 17 centuries ago. \n \n Now the results of scientific tests provided to National Geographic appear to confirm that the remains of a limestone cave enshrined within the church are remnants of the tomb located by the ancient Romans. \n \n Mortar sampled from between the original limestone surface of the tomb and a marble slab that covers it has been dated to around A.D. 345. According to historical accounts, the tomb was discovered by the Romans and enshrined around 326. \n \n View Images A restorer removes debris beneath a broken marble slab to expose the original rock surface of what is considered the burial place of Jesus. Photograph by Oded Balilty, AP for National Geographic \n \n Until now, the earliest architectural evidence found in and around the tomb complex dated to the Crusader period, making it no older than 1,000 years. \n \n While it is archaeologically impossible to say that the tomb is the burial site of an individual Jew known as Jesus of Nazareth, who according to New Testament accounts was crucified in Jerusalem in 30 or 33, new dating results put the original construction of today's tomb complex securely in the time of Constantine, Rome's first Christian emperor. \n \n The tomb was opened for the first time in centuries in October 2016, when the shrine that encloses the tomb, known as the Edicule, underwent a significant restoration by an interdisciplinary team from the National Technical University of Athens. \n \n Several samples of mortar from different locations within the Edicule were taken at that time for dating, and the results were recently provided to National Geographic by Chief Scientific Supervisor Antonia Moropoulou, who directed the Edicule restoration project. \n \n When Constantine's representatives arrived in Jerusalem around 325 to locate the tomb, they were allegedly pointed to a Roman temple built some 200 years earlier. The Roman temple was razed and excavations beneath it revealed a tomb hewn from a limestone cave. The top of the cave was sheared off to expose the interior of the tomb, and the Edicule was built around it. \n \n A feature of the tomb is a long shelf, or \"burial bed,\" which according to tradition was where the body of Jesus Christ was laid out following crucifixion. Such shelves and niches, hewn from limestone caves, are a common feature in tombs of wealthy 1st-century Jerusalem Jews. \n \n The marble cladding that covers the \"burial bed\" is believed to have been installed in 1555 at the latest, and most likely was present since the mid-1300s, according to pilgrim accounts. \n \n When the tomb was opened on the night of October 26, 2016, scientists were surprised by what they found beneath the marble cladding: an older, broken marble slab incised with a cross, resting directly atop the original limestone surface of the \"burial bed.\" \n \n Some researchers speculated that this older slab may have been laid down in the Crusader period, while others offered an earlier date, suggesting that it may have already been in place and broken when the church was destroyed in 1009. No one, however, was ready to claim that this might be the first physical evidence for the earliest Roman shrine on the site. \n \n Is This Really The Tomb Of Christ? Scholars discuss whether the tomb of Christ is actually the tomb of Christ and how it would have looked. \n \n The new test results, which reveal the lower slab was most likely mortared in place in the mid-fourth century under the orders of Emperor Constantine, come as a welcome surprise to those who study the history of the sacred monument. \n \n \"Obviously that date is spot-on for whatever Constantine did,\" says archaeologist Martin Biddle, who published a seminal study on the history of the tomb in 1999. \"That's very remarkable.\" \n \n During their year-long restoration of the Edicule, the scientists were also able to determine that a significant amount of the burial cave remains enclosed within the walls of the shrine. Mortar samples taken from remains of the southern wall of the cave were dated to 335 and 1570, which provide additional evidence for construction works from the Roman period, as well as a documented 16th-century restoration. Mortar taken from the tomb entrance has been dated to the 11th century and is consistent with the reconstruction of the Edicule following its destruction in 1009. \n \n \"It is interesting how [these] mortars not only provide evidence for the earliest shrine on the site, but also confirm the historical construction sequence of the Edicule,\" Moropoulou observes. \n \n The mortar samples were independently dated at two separate labs using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), a technique that determines when quartz sediment was most recently exposed to light. The scientific results will be published by Moropoulou and her team in a forthcoming issue of the Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports. \n \n Secrets of Christ\u2019s Tomb premieres Sunday December 3 at 9/8c on the National Geographic Channel. The immersive, 3-D exhibition \" Tomb of Christ: The Church of the Holy Sepulchre Experience\" is open at the National Geographic Museum in Washington D.C. through the fall of 2018.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Millions of people flock to Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre each year. Many believe it to house the tomb of Jesus Christ, though scientists have thus far been unable to date the tomb to the time when the Romans built a church around it. Now, however, a new series of tests \"corroborates our historical accounts\" as a National Geographic writer puts it to NBC News. It's easiest to understand the significance by understanding the history: Around AD 325, experts believe Roman Emperor Constantine the Great arrived in Jerusalem on the hunt for places linked to Jesus; his team identified the cave that they believed Jesus was buried in and built a shrine (known as the Edicule) to enclose the tomb and then a church around it. That church was destroyed in 1009, recounts National Geographic. It was rebuilt, and all archaeological dating coincided with that rebuilding\u2014proving it was at most about 1,000 years old. The tomb was opened for the first time in centuries in October 2016 to allow for the Edicule to be restored. A marble slab was discovered beneath marble cladding, and mortar samples taken from the slab dated to around AD 345. National Geographic's take: \"While it is archaeologically impossible to say that the tomb is the burial site of an individual Jew known as Jesus of Nazareth ... [the] results put the original construction of today's tomb complex securely in the time of Constantine.\" (Scientists have issued a dire warning about the site.)",

USA TODAY \n \n Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. in Chico, California, in making Resilience Butte County Proud IPA, the proceeds of which will support Camp Fire relief efforts. (Photo: Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.) \n \n The deadliest fire in California history has set into motion the largest charitable collaboration ever among the nation's breweries, as more than 1,200 have signed on to brew a beer to raise funds for those affected by the Camp Fire in Northern California. \n \n Sierra Nevada Brewing Co., which is located in Chico, California, part of Butte County but west of the areas hardest hit by the fire, fed first responders and displaced residents during the fire and handed out clothing, too. \n \n But Ken Grossman, who founded the brewery in 1980, wanted to do more. He decided to brew a special beer, Resilience Butte County Proud IPA, and donate all the proceeds to the Sierra Nevada Camp Fire Relief Fund, which it seeded with a $100,000 donation. \n \n Then, Grossman asked other breweries across the U.S. to join in. \"We are working with malt, hop and yeast suppliers to provide raw ingredient donations to all participating breweries and are asking those breweries to donate 100 percent of their sales to the fund, as well,\" he said in the letter, a copy of which is posted online. \n \n \"We know that the rebuilding process will take time, but we\u2019re in this for the long haul,\" Grossman said. \"Our hope is to get Resilience IPA in taprooms all over the country to create a solid start for our community\u2019s future.\" \n \n More: Paradise fire survivor: 'This was my home before, and I want it to be again' \n \n More: Colossal California wildfire finally contained; grim search for bodies continues \n \n Collaboration is common among independent brewers, and so is the brewing of charity beers. But the response to Sierra Nevada's Camp Fire initiative has been historic. \"I\u2019m quite sure that it\u2019s both the largest-ever collaboration and the biggest industry charity ever,\" said Garrett Oliver, brewmaster at Brooklyn Brewery. \n \n So far, more than 1,000 breweries have pledged to make their own batches of Resilience Butte County Proud IPA. \"This is a great idea spearheaded by a great indie craft brewing pioneer supporting a great cause,\" said Sam Calagione, co-founder of Dogfish Head Craft Brewery in Milton, Delaware, which brewed its batch of Resilience IPA and plans to serve it in late December. \n \n \"Our thoughts are with all of the brave folks who have helped navigate this challenging moment in Northern California and all of the families who have lost love ones,\" Calagione said. \"The craft brewing community has always been altruistic and mutually supportive, and giving back to our communities is one of the things we collectively do best.\" \n \n Dogfish Head Craft Brewery in Milton, Delaware, is one of about 1,000 breweries joining Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. in making Resilience Butte County IPA, the proceeds of which will support Camp Fire relief efforts. (Photo: Dogfish Head Craft Brewery) \n \n Another of the participating breweries, Fort Collins, Colorado-headquartered New Belgium Brewing, recalls the hardship caused by the nearby 2012 High Park fire. The brewery's paperboard manufacturer, Graphic Packaging International, is located in Oroville, California, in Butte County. \n \n \u201cMany of their co-workers have tragically lost their homes, yet they\u2019re still coming to work every day. That is the definition of resilience, and we\u2019re happy to support recovery efforts in any way that we can,\" New Belgium Brewing CEO Steve Fechheimer said. New Belgium brewed its batch Tuesday and plans to make it available at its Fort Collins and Asheville tasting rooms in about two weeks. \n \n \"At New Belgium, we believe that business can be a force for good, and we think that ethos is shared throughout the craft beer community,\u201d Fechheimer said. \n \n Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. in Chico, California, in making Resilience Butte County Proud IPA, the proceeds of which will support Camp Fire relief efforts. (Photo: Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.) \n \n Sierra Nevada brewed its batch of more than 74,000 gallons on Tuesday and plans to release it Jan. 5, 2019. Sierra will can some of that beer and also make it available on draft. Other participating breweries will only sell Resilience IPA on draft, with most releases planned in late December and early January. Overall, the project should yield about 8.6 million pints of beer, the brewery estimates. \n \n Breweries joining include small, midsize and regional breweries nationwide as well as Anheuser-Busch-owned Goose Island Beer Co. and Miller Coors-owned Blue Moon Brewing Co. For a list of the breweries participating, go to Sierra Nevada's website. There's also a Google Doc on the brewery site, now listing more than 1,200 breweries on board. \n \n There are now more than 1,000 breweries listed on the @SierraNevada \n \n Resilience Butte County Proud IPA page. Pretty awesome reminder of how the brewing community can come together.https://t.co/Z2hB12BSlq \u2014 Bart Watson (@BrewersStats) November 27, 2018 \n \n \"Even as the beer industry has grown so much since the early days and become increasingly competitive, it is so wonderful to see hundreds of breweries nationwide rallying behind one of the movement's absolute most important pioneers,\" said Greg Engert, beer director for Neighborhood Restaurant Group in Alexandria, Virginia, which brewed a batch of the IPA at its Bluejacket brewery in Washington, D.C. \n \n Sierra Nevada's Grossman had hopes of sharing the beer's recipe with perhaps 500 breweries that would also make the beer and donate the proceeds. \"That was kind of his pie-in-the-sky goal; if we really work hard maybe we can hit 500 breweries, and we have doubled that number,\" brewery spokesperson Robin Gregory said. \"I know he wanted to raise at least seven figures, and it looks like, if our math is correct, it\u2019s going to be a bit higher than that.\" \n \n Stone is proud to be participating in @SierraNevada\u2019s #ResilienceIPA charity efforts.

About 15 percent of Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. employees lost their homes in the fire, as did \"countless friends and family members as well,\" she said. \n \n Even before the fire was officially extinguished, the brewery had set up the relief fund. \"Once the fire is out, we will distribute all donated money to partner organizations that are dedicated to rebuilding and supporting the communities that have been affected,\" Grossman said in a note on the brewery's website, also signed by daughter Sierra and son Brian. \n \n The beer is a \"really classic\" West Coast-style India pale ale made with Centennial and Cascade hops, Gregory said. \"If it's going to be raising money to rebuild our community, we felt like it should be a taste of home. We wanted to go with that classic danky west coast IPA ... (that is) fresh, piney, citrusy, hop-heavy, and nice and bright.\" \n \n Thank you @ButteSheriff@KoryHonea for helping us brew Resilience Butte County Proud IPA today.

    "document": "LISTEN TO ARTICLE 5:30 SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email \n \n A former associate of Paul Manafort pleaded guilty to a lobbying crime and agreed to cooperate with the U.S., giving prosecutors access to insights from a longtime international political operative whose Russian business partner has already been indicted in Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe. \n \n The lobbyist, Sam Patten, 47, admitted that he failed to register in the U.S. as a foreign agent for his work lobbying on behalf of a Ukrainian political party. The nature of his cooperation isn\u2019t clear. Patten worked with Manafort and on Ukrainian campaigns, and reportedly worked on microtargeting operations with Cambridge Analytica. \n \n Mueller\u2019s office referred the prosecution to U.S. Attorney Jessie Liu in the District of Columbia, according William Miller, a spokesman for Liu, who declined to comment about the nature of the cooperation or other matters relating to an ongoing investigation. \n \n Patten appeared in federal court in Washington on Friday. \n \n Patten\u2019s plea agreement also included the suggestion that the Trump Inaugural Committee improperly accepted funds from a foreigner. Patten admitted that he illegally helped a Ukrainian oligarch buy a ticket to Trump\u2019s swearing-in through a straw-man donor, though as part of his cooperation agreement he wasn\u2019t charged. \n \n A onetime State Department official under President George W. Bush, Patten headed the Moscow office of the International Republican Institute in the early 2000s. A Russian employee of IRI at the time, Konstantin Kilimnik, went on to work as a fixer for Manafort in Ukraine and is a business partner with Patten. \n \n Kilimnik has been indicted in absentia alongside Manafort on obstruction of justice charges. Manafort, who was one of President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign chairmen, was found guilty this month in Alexandria, Virginia, of tax and bank fraud charges and is being held in jail. He\u2019s due to stand trial in Washington next month on the obstruction charges as well as charges of money laundering and failure to register for his own lobbying work in Ukraine. \n \n Manafort\u2019s Second Trial Looms, and There May Still Be Third \n \n Patten entered his plea before U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, the same judge who\u2019s overseeing Manafort\u2019s money-laundering and obstruction of justice trial in Washington, scheduled to start next month. \n \n Watching from the gallery was Andrew Weissmann, an expert on money laundering and complex fraud cases who will be the lead prosecutor in Manafort\u2019s trial in Washington. Also in attendance was Scott Claffee, a trial lawyer in the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division. \n \n From 2014, Patten provided a \u201cprominent\u201d Ukrainian oligarch who isn\u2019t named in court papers and his Opposition Bloc political party with lobbying and consulting services, according to the criminal information. A company Patten co-owned with a Russian national received more than $1 million for the work, the U.S. said. \n \n Details about the Ukrainian oligarch match those of Sergei Lyovochkin, an Opposition Bloc leader whom prosecutors have previously identified as funding Manafort\u2019s work in Ukraine. He couldn\u2019t immediately been reached for comment. \n \n As part of his lobbying work, Patten violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act by not disclosing the work to the U.S., prosecutors said. No date has been set for his sentencing. \n \n Cambridge Analytica \n \n Patten worked for multiple political parties and office-holders in Ukraine, according to his website. His work for Cambridge Analytica came during the 2014 election cycle, the Daily Beast reported in April. It was later adopted by \u201cat least one major U.S. presidential candidate,\u201d the Daily Beast said. Patten told the publication that his work for Cambridge Analytica was separate from the work of his consulting firm. \n \n Cambridge Analytica Files U.S. Bankruptcy After Data Scandal \n \n Patten formed a consulting firm in 2015 with Kilimnik, whom Mueller indicted in June. Kilimnik has been identified in filings as having worked for the Russian military\u2019s intelligence service known as the GRU. One filing cited an FBI assessment that his relations to the GRU continued through the 2016 election, which Kilimnik has denied. \n \n The firm that the two set up, Begemot Ventures International Ltd., listed Patten and Kilimnik as the sole officers, according to its Washington, D.C., incorporation records. The company\u2019s website describes it as \u201ca strategic and political advisory firm that helps its clients win elections, strengthen political parities, build the right arguments before domestic and international audiences and achieve better results.\u201d \n \n Begemot, which is Russian for behemoth, matches details of the unidentified firm that prosecutors say received cash for Patten\u2019s Ukraine work. \n \n Patten registered with Congress in 2016 to lobby for a group called the Committee to Destroy Isis, which was financed in part by a Jordanian construction company, according to disclosures filed with the Senate Office of Public Records. He disclosed payments of $50,000 and stopped lobbying for the group in July. \n \n It\u2019s unclear why Mueller referred the case. Previously, he referred information about Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen to the U.S. attorney in Manhattan. In July, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said the Justice Department\u2019s national security division would take over responsibility of a case filed against a dozen Russian military intelligence officers accused of hacking into the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. \n \n \u201cIt may have to do with the size of the case, the nature of the case, the resources needed for the case,\u201d said Mike Koenig, a former Justice Department prosecutor. \n \n The Senate Intelligence Committee made a separate criminal referral to the Justice Department based on statements and documents provided by Patten, the committee\u2019s chairman, Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, said in a written statement. \n \n \u2014 With assistance by Greg Farrell, Stephanie Baker, Erik Larson, Nick Wadhams, and Bill Allison ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A business associate of a key figure in the investigation into former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort pleaded guilty Friday to failing to register as a foreign agent. \n \n W.

Scientists ran more tests and discovered its effectiveness at treating erectile dysfunction. \n \n Because of biological similarities between the lungs and penis, scientists also discovered it could help protect against pulmonary hypertension, common in climbers. \n \n At high altitudes decreased levels of oxygen can trigger high blood pressure in the lungs, which in extreme circumstance can be fatal. \n \n Viagra reduces high blood pressure and improves the transport of oxygen in the blood. \n \n Meanwhile, South Korean authorities have raided the offices of Samsung and the national pension fund as part of a corruption investigation linked to the president. \n \n They are probing whether Ms Park pressured the fund to support a Samsung merger, said the Yonhap news agency. \n \n Image copyright Reuters Image caption Investigators seized evidence at the National Pension Service \n \n Samsung's offices had already been raided over related allegations. \n \n Wednesday's raid had to do with a merger last year between the electronics giant's construction arm, Samsung C&T, and an affiliate firm, Cheil Industries. \n \n For weeks, tens of thousands of protesters have gathered in Seoul to demand Ms Park's resignation - a call she has resisted. ||||| Park Geun-hye\u2019s aides say branded and generic versions were purchased to treat altitude sickness for staff on trips to elevated capitals in Africa \n \n South Korea President Park Geun-hye\u2019s office has confirmed revelations by an opposition lawmaker that it purchased about 360 erectile dysfunction Viagra pills and the generic version of the drug in December. \n \n \n \n While the report has created a frenzy on the internet, Park\u2019s office said the pills were bought to potentially treat altitude sickness for presidential aides and employees on Park\u2019s May trips to Ethiopia, Uganda and Kenya, whose capitals are thousands of metres above sea level. \n \n Turmoil in east Asia: sensitive moment for region unsettled by Trump Read more \n \n The pills were not used, said Jung Youn-kuk, spokesman of the presidential Blue House.

    "document": "Letter of Resignation from the Palo Alto Planning and Transportation Commission \n \n Sorry, we\u2019re full! \n \n Dear City Council Members and Palo Alto Residents, \n \n This letter serves as my official resignation from the Planning and Transportation Commission. My family has decided to move to Santa Cruz. After many years of trying to make it work in Palo Alto, my husband and I cannot see a way to stay in Palo Alto and raise a family here. We rent our current home with another couple for $6200 a month; if we wanted to buy the same home and share it with children and not roommates, it would cost $2.7M and our monthly payment would be $12,177 a month in mortgage, taxes, and insurance. That\u2019s $146,127 per year \u2014 an entire professional\u2019s income before taxes. This is unaffordable even for an attorney and a software engineer. \n \n It\u2019s clear that if professionals like me cannot raise a family here, then all of our teachers, first responders, and service workers are in dire straits. We already see openings at our police department that we can\u2019t fill and numerous teacher contracts that we can\u2019t renew because the cost of housing is astronomical not just in Palo Alto but many miles in each direction. I have repeatedly made recommendations to the Council to expand the housing supply in Palo Alto so that together with our neighboring cities who are already adding housing, we can start to make a dent in the jobs-housing imbalance that causes housing prices throughout the Bay Area to spiral out of control. Small steps like allowing 2 floors of housing instead of 1 in mixed use developments, enforcing minimum density requirements so that developers build apartments instead of penthouses, legalizing duplexes, easing restrictions on granny units, leveraging the residential parking permit program to experiment with housing for people who don\u2019t want or need two cars, and allowing single-use areas like the Stanford shopping center to add housing on top of shops (or offices), would go a long way in adding desperately needed housing units while maintaining the character of our neighborhoods and preserving historic structures throughout. \n \n Time and again, I\u2019ve seen dozens of people come to both Commission meetings and Council meetings asking Council to make housing its top priority. The City Council received over 1000 signatures from Palo Alto residents asking for the same. In the annual Our Palo Alto survey, it is the top issue cited by residents. This Council has ignored the majority of residents and has charted a course for the next 15 years of this city\u2019s development which substantially continues the same job-housing imbalance this community has been suffering from for some time now: more offices, a nominal amount of housing which the Council is already laying the groundwork to tax out of existence, lip service to preserving retail that simply has no reason to keep serving the average Joe when the city is only affordable to Joe Millionaires. \n \n Over the last 5 years I\u2019ve seen dozens of my friends leave Palo Alto and often leave the Bay Area entirely. I\u2019ve seen friends from other states get job offers here and then turn them down when they started to look at the price of housing. I struggle to think what Palo Alto will become and what it will represent when young families have no hope of ever putting down roots here, and meanwhile the community is engulfed with middle-aged jet-setting executives and investors who are hardly the sort to be personally volunteering for neighborhood block parties, earthquake preparedness responsibilities, or neighborhood watch. If things keep going as they are, yes, Palo Alto\u2019s streets will look just as they did decades ago, but its inhabitants, spirit, and sense of community will be unrecognizable. A once thriving city will turn into a hollowed out museum. We should take care to remember that Palo Alto is famous the world over for its residents\u2019 accomplishments, but none of those people would be able to live in Palo Alto were they starting out today. \n \n Sincerely, \n \n Kate Downing \n \n UPDATE: Thank you so much for the outpouring of interest and support. While we are leaving Palo Alto, the organization I co-founded that is working to invest in housing and transportation will continue on its work so that maybe in the future we can have a more inclusive community. If you\u2019d like to learn more, go here. \n \n If you\u2019d like to look into the belly of the beast, read the comments on our local paper: Palo Alto Online. The loudest voices in the community feel that the desire to create more affordable housing is spoiled entitlement.

In the annual Our Palo Alto survey, it is the top issue cited by residents. \n \n \"This council has ignored the majority of residents and has chartered a course for the next 15 years of this city's development, which substantially continues the same job-housing imbalance this community has been suffering from for some time now: more offices, a nominal amount of housing, which the Council is already laying the groundwork to tax out of existence, lip service to preserving retail that simply has no reason to keep serving the average Joe when the city is only available to Joe Millionaires.\" \n \n In her resignation letter, Downing pointed to the city's difficulties in filling job openings in the Palo Alto Police Department and renewing contracts with the local teachers because of the \"astronomical\" cost of housing, not just in Palo Alto but \"many miles in each direction.\" \n \n It is clear, she wrote, that \"if professionals like me cannot raise a family here, then all of our teachers, first responders, and service workers are in dire straits.\" \n \n Downing herself is facing similar challenges, despite the fact that she is a corporate attorney and her husband is a software engineer at Palantir. For several years, they have been renting a home in the Ventura neighborhood. Now, they are preparing to move to Santa Cruz. \n \n In her resignation letter, Downing wrote that \"After many years of trying to make it work in Palo Alto, my husband and I cannot see a way to stay in Palo Alto and raise a family here.\" \n \n \"We rent our current home with another couple for $6,200 a month; if we wanted to buy the same home and share it with children and not roommates, it would cost $2.7M and our monthly payment would be $12,177 a month in mortgage, taxes and insurance,\" Downing wrote. \"That's $146,127 per year -- an entire professional's income before taxes. This is unaffordable even for an attorney and a software engineer.\" \n \n Downing also noted that over the last five years, she'd seen dozens of her friends leave Palo Alto and, in some cases, the Bay Area. She also said that she has seen friends from other states get job offers in Palo Alto and then turn them down whey they started to look at the price of housing. \n \n \"I struggle to think what Palo Alto will become and what it will represent when young families have no hope of ever putting down roots here, and meanwhile the community is engulfed with middle-aged jet-setting executives and investors who are hardly the sort to be personally volunteering for neighborhood block parties, earthquake preparedness responsibilities, or neighborhood watch,\" Downing wrote. \"If things keep going as they are, yes, Palo Alto's streets will look just as they did decades ago, but its inhabitants, spirit, and sense of community will be unrecognizable. \n \n \"A once thriving city will turn into a hollowed out museum. We should take care to remember that Palo Alto is famous the world over for its residents\u2019 accomplishments, but none of those people would be able to live in Palo Alto were they starting out today,\" she wrote. \n \n Downing is hardly alone in urging the council to act with more urgency on promoting affordable housing. In March, more than 1,000 residents, including numerous former mayors and planning commissioners, signed a petition spearheaded by Palo Alto Forward that urged the council to do more to address this topic. \n \n \"The cost of living in Palo Alto has skyrocketed. As a result, we are seeing long-time neighbors move because they can no longer afford the rent,\" the petition stated. \"It is not unusual for Palo Alto workers to commute in from areas as far as Stockton, Gilroy and Tracy, putting severe strain on our roads and our climate. We are on the path to being a city composed only of long-time landowners and wealthy newcomers. This situation is the result of city policies that have discouraged new housing while encouraging more office space.\" \n \n Recent surveys also suggest that residents are growing increasingly anxious about getting priced out of Palo Alto. In the city's annual survey, the number of people who gave Palo Alto good grades for \"variety of housing options\u201d dropped from 27 percent in 2014 to 20 percent in 2015, while the percentage of people who ranked the city as a good or excellent place to retire dropped from 60 percent to 52 percent between 2014 and 2015 (in 2006, it was 68 percent). \n \n Local concerns about housing were also highlighted in a poll that the city commissioned last spring, when it was considering whether to proceed with a business tax to address traffic congestion. The poll showed 76 percent of the respondents listing \"cost of housing\" as an \"extremely serious\" or \"very serious\" problem, a higher percentage than any other issue (the drought and traffic congestion scored second and third, with 65 percent and 53 percent, respectively). \n \n Downing's letter comes at a particularly sensitive time for local politics. The city is about to hold its first City Council election since the slow-growth \"residentialist\" camp won the council majority in 2014 and four of the council's nine seats will be up for grabs. \n \n Several candidates jumping into the race, including current planning commission Chair Adrian Fine, Human Relations Commission Chair Greer Stone and technology executive Michelle Kraus (all of whom are renters) have vowed to make creation of more housing options a priority if elected. \n \n --- \n \n Follow the Palo Alto Weekly/Palo Alto Online on Twitter @PaloAltoWeekly and Facebook for breaking news, local events, photos, videos and more. ||||| PALO ALTO -- You're a well-paid professional. You work in tech. You've got it made. \n \n Not if you want to buy a house in Silicon Valley. \n \n On Wednesday, a planning commissioner here became the very public voice of the region's frustrations over spiraling housing costs when she published her resignation letter to the city of Palo Alto. It said that she and her husband are moving to Santa Cruz because -- even with their combined incomes as a tech lawyer and software engineer -- they can't afford to live in this upscale city. \n \n After five years of \"trying to make it work in Palo Alto, my husband and I cannot see a way to stay in Palo Alto and raise a family here,\" Planning and Transportation Commissioner Kate Downing wrote in her public resignation letter. \n \n The letter makes personal what the numbers show: That rising rents and home prices of recent years have put the region beyond the reach of many, even some at the top of the heap -- including in the lucrative tech industry that fuels the rush for housing. \n \n The average rent in Palo Alto was $3,463 in the second quarter of 2016, according to a report last month from Novato-based RealFacts. In June, the median price of a single-family home was $1.2 million in San Mateo County and $982,500 in Santa Clara County, according to the CoreLogic real estate information service. \n \n Downing, 31, has a full-time job as senior corporate counsel to a tech company in Santa Clara. In an interview, she explained that her letter \"is not supposed to be a sad story about me. I'm going to land on my feet. I'm extraordinarily lucky and privileged. I'm going to be fine.\" \n \n Advertisement \n \n Rather, she characterized the letter as a warning call about economic trends and failed policies that are hurting Palo Alto and the region. \"It's clear,\" she wrote, \"that if professionals like me cannot raise a family here, then all of our teachers, first responders and service workers are in dire straits.\" \n \n Downing and her engineer husband, Steve Downing, 33, share a 2,300-square-foot, four-bedroom house in Palo Alto's Ventura neighborhood with another couple. The monthly rent is $6,200. \n \n \"That's actually pretty cheap for here,\" she said in the interview. \"We probably pay on the low end of what they could get for our home.\" \n \n Her letter calculated that if the couple \"wanted to buy the same home and share it with children and not roommates, it would cost $2.7 million, and our monthly payment would be $12,177 a month in mortgage, taxes and insurance. That's $146,127 per year -- an entire professional's income before taxes. This is unaffordable even for an attorney and a software engineer.\" \n \n The Downings based those numbers on putting 20 percent down: \"If you put down less than that, you're not going to get picked,\" she said. \"Everyone knows how competitive it is in Palo Alto, with multiple offers on every house. Some of them are putting down all cash. They're coming in with just gigantic deposits.\" \n \n Downing's letter, a colleague said, is a timely commentary on Palo Alto's changing demographics: \"All of us who are in our 20s and 30 and 40s -- we're used to seeing people leave,\" said Elaine Uang, a co-founder with Downing of the community group Palo Alto Forward. \n \n \"You never know when your friends are going to go because there aren't the right housing options here for them to pursue the next stage of life.\" \n \n A commissioner since November 2014, Downing said in the letter that the city has failed to move the dial on housing. Stating that her own recommendations to the City Council have gone nowhere, she outlined some of the ways in which the housing supply might be expanded in order to \"make a dent in the jobs-housing imbalance that causes housing prices throughout the Bay Area to spiral out of control.\" \n \n She mentioned \"small steps like allowing two floors of housing instead of one in mixed-used developments,\" as well as legalizing duplexes, streamlining restrictions on granny units and \"enforcing minimum-density requirements\" so that developers will \"build apartments instead of penthouses.\" Housing should be allowed, she wrote, above shops and offices in single-use areas like the Stanford Shopping Center. \n \n \"Kate does a good job summarizing the challenges we're facing as a community,\" said Councilman Cory Wolbach. \"To say that Palo Alto has been slow to add housing is a very accurate statement. \n \n \"There's nothing shocking here,\" he added, in regard to Downing's letter. \"Palo Alto certainly does not encourage high-density, smaller, more reasonably priced units. It's unfortunate but true.\" \n \n Palo Alto \"is not the family-oriented community it used to be,\" Downing said. In her estimation, it's becoming a place for \"jet-setting executives and investors\" who have neither the time or inclination to help out with block parties or join Neighborhood Watch. \n \n \"Young people are not moving here anymore. It used to be a place of innovation, where people created art and sculpture in their backyards or started companies in their garages. Now, it's more for people who are CEOs and executive vice presidents.\" \n \n Contact Richard Scheinin at 408-920-5069, read his stories at www.mercurynews.com/richard-scheinin and follow him at Twitter.com/RealEstateRag. ||||| In what\u2019s becoming a regular story in the Bay Area, many Peninsula towns\u2019 refusal to increase housing has led to a mass exit of long-time, working-class residents. First responders, police, teachers, grocery store clerks\u2014the list goes on. \n \n These small cities, rich with tech money and close-proximity desirability, have left it to San Francisco, Oakland, and only a few other areas to house the influx of new-moneyed arrivals. \n \n And with that, another noteworthy exodus has taken place: Palo Alto Planning and Transportation commissioner Kate Vershov Downing and her family have decided to leave the pricey town for Santa Cruz because they, like many other residents, can no longer afford the area. \n \n In a letter of resignation, she starts off saying: \n \n Dear City Council Members and Palo Alto Residents, This letter serves as my official resignation from the Planning and Transportation Commission. My family has decided to move to Santa Cruz. After many years of trying to make it work in Palo Alto, my husband and I cannot see a way to stay in Palo Alto and raise a family here.

That\u2019s $146,127 per year \u2014 an entire professional\u2019s income before taxes. This is unaffordable even for an attorney and a software engineer. \n \n Downing goes on to note that the city council is, in part, to blame for this mess, noting that pleas from citizenry for more housing go ignored. \n \n I have repeatedly made recommendations to the Council to expand the housing supply in Palo Alto so that together with our neighboring cities who are already adding housing, we can start to make a dent in the jobs-housing imbalance that causes housing prices throughout the Bay Area to spiral out of control.

The Telegraph reports the newlyweds have just adopted a cocker spaniel puppy, whose name has not been released. \n \n According to the report, the puppy is barely a few months old and is the son of Kate's mother's dog, Ella. \n \n US Weekly reports the couple was initially worried they weren't ready to take care of a pet, but after a short trial period, all fears were assuaged. \n \n \"William and Catherine fell in love with the pup instantly and it wasn't long before they decided to keep him,\" a Palace aide told the magazine. \"He's now part of the royal fold!\" ||||| Duke and Duchess welcome new arrival: Kate and Wills adopt pet cocker spaniel but the name remains a mystery \n \n \n \n The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge now have a three-month old puppy \n \n The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have welcomed a new addition to their family - an adorable three-month old puppy. \n \n \n \n The couple acquired the male cocker spaniel in early December and have been happily settling him in at their rented farmhouse in North Wales. \n \n \n \n Remarkably, however, William and Kate have given palace aides strict instructions not to publicly reveal the name of their pet, arguing that it is a \u2018private\u2019 matter. \n \n \n \n \u2018He is a private pet and they do not want his name to be made public although the couple are happy to confirm that they do, indeed, have a new dog,\u2019 a spokesman at St James\u2019s Palace, the couple\u2019s London headquarters, intoned. \n \n \n \n Royal sources say the black pup is \u2018a few months old\u2019 and comes from a litter bred by Kate\u2019s mother, Carole Middleton, who adores the breed. \n \n \n \n \u2018I don\u2019t know whether the Middleton family dog is a boy or a girl, but the Duke and Duchess\u2019s puppy is the result of the family dog breeding with one belonging to another breeder,\u2019 said an aide. \n \n \n \n The new dog is the couple\u2019s first together and replaces Prince William\u2019s black labrador, Widgeon, who died about two years ago. \n \n \n \n Over the years, the Royal Family have embraced dogs as their favoured pets. \n \n Formal portraits from the 17th century onwards show kings, queens and their children happily posing with their beloved animals, from pugs to greyhounds, King Charles spaniels to corgis. \n \n Some pets have even merited their own portraits, and, as in many households, were considered very much members of the family. \n \n Prince William\u2019s black labrador, Widgeon, died about two years ago (left, stock picture) but now he has acquired a male cocker spaniel with wife Kate \n \n When Queen Victoria\u2019s beloved collie, Noble, died at Balmoral in 1887, he was buried in the grounds of the castle and given his own gravestone, which read: \n \n \n \n 'Noble by name by nature noble too \n \n \n \n Faithful companion sympathetic true \n \n \n \n His remains are interred here' \n \n \n \n A terrier named Caesar belonging to King Edward VII was given even greater status when, having outlived the king, he walked behind His Majesty\u2019s coffin in the funeral procession. \n \n \n \n The current Queen is, of course, associated with the corgi. \n \n \n \n The breed was introduced to the Royal Family by her father, King George VI, in 1933 when he bought a corgi called Dookie from a local kennels. \n \n \n \n For her eighteenth birthday, The Queen was given a corgi named Susan from whom numerous successive dogs were bred. \n \n \n \n Some corgis were mated with dachshunds (most notably Pipkin, who belonged to Princess Margaret) to create \u2018dorgis\u2019. \n \n At present, The Queen owns three corgis, Monty, Willow and Holly and three dorgis, Cider, Candy and Vulcan, who travel with her everywhere, with Her Majesty looking after them herself as much as possible. \n \n Tradition: The current Queen is associated with the corgi \n \n Other members of the Royal Family own dogs of various breeds. The Duchess of Cornwall owns two Jack Russell terriers, Tosca and Rosie, and recently acquired a rescue pup called Beth from Battersea Dogs and Cats Home. \n \n \n \n Spaniels are one of the oldest known breeds of dogs and are believed to have to come to the UK during Caesar\u2019s invasion in 55 and 54 BC. \n \n \n \n It is assumed they originated from Spain as the word spaniel is believed to have been derived from Hispania or possibly from the French phrase chiens de l\u2019Espagnol (dog of Spain). \n \n \n \n Spaniels were initially bred to flush game out of dense brush but by the late 1600\u2019s had become specialized into water and land breeds. \n \n \n \n The difference between cocker and springer spaniels is that the former are smaller, more compact, dogs and can have marginally more placid temperaments. \n \n \n \n As a breed cocker spaniels have friendly, affectionate, happy natures and considered to be wonderful family pets. \n \n \n \n The arrival of the couple\u2019s anonymous new pooch is particularly timely as he will help keep Kate, 30, company while her husband is posted to the Falkland Islands for six weeks. \n \n \n \n Search and Rescue pilot William, 29, will fly out tonight with his Sea King crew on a routine deployment to the region, leaving his wife on her own. \n \n \n \n She is expected to spend more time in London while he is away and will largely live with her pup at Kensington Palace, the couple\u2019s London base. \n \n \n \n Last night betting firm Ladbrokes were offering odds of 10/1 on the dog being called Charlie, 33/1 on Bouncer and 66/1 on Fenton, after the now world-famous hound seen chasing deer in Richmond Park, which became a YouTube sensation. \n \n \n \n The pup has not been formally revealed in public yet but has been seen being walked by the couple on beaches near their Anglesey home.",

Some issue stern pre-show warnings that anyone caught texting or talking will be shown the door. \n \n It's not surprising then that the new chief executive and president of AMC Theaters, Adam M. Aron, caused a stir by suggesting that nation's second-largest movie theater company would consider the idea of making certain auditoriums \"more texting friendly\" in a bid to get millennials to go to the movies more often. \n \n \"When you tell a 22-year-old to turn off the phone, don't ruin the movie, they hear please cut off your left arm above the elbow,\" said Aron in an interview with Variety published online Wednesday. \n \n \"You can't tell a 22-year-old to turn off their cellphone. That's not how they live,\" said Aron, who hailed from outside the movie business before taking the reins of parent company AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC) in January. \n \n His suggestion that the company might revisit its stance on texting during shows didn't sit well with many movie buffs, who flooded AMC's social media accounts with objections. Some threatened to take their business elsewhere if AMC followed through with the idea. \n \n The company quickly responded to the backlash with the following post: \"Press reports we are considering test allowing texts in a very few screens. We know vast majority of audience wants no texting. If ever, we only would pursue this in a way that we can be totally confident ALL our guests will fully enjoy the movie-going experience at AMC.\" \n \n That still wasn't enough to quell critics on Twitter and Facebook. By Friday, AMC retreated with a company statement that included the following tweet: \n \n NO TEXTING AT AMC. Won't happen. You spoke. We listened. Quickly, that idea has been sent to the cutting room floor. pic.twitter.com/JR0fo5megR \u2014 AMC Theatres (@AMCTheatres) April 15, 2016 \n \n Aron, former CEO of Starwood Hotels & Resorts (HOT), is no doubt mulling new ways for AMC to woo an increasingly distracted and demanding audience. Rather than turn off their smartphones, many millennials would rather skip the theater altogether, or kick back at home and stream movies on their flat-screen TVs or mobile devices, via Netflix (NFLX) and other services. \n \n In 2015, America's 18- to 24-year olds represented 10 percent of the U.S. population and bought 14 percent of all movie tickets sold here, down from 16 percent in 2014, according to Stan Meyers, a Piper Jaffray & Co. analyst who covers media and entertainment companies. \n \n Teens, somewhat surprisingly, are going to the movies more often these days, as are those in the 60-plus set, as measured by their percentage contributions to overall ticket sales between 2014 and 2015, said Meyers. \n \n \"One of the things keeping millennials away from the movies is that they need to be on their phones all the time. What [Adam Aron] wants to do is segregate different groups so that people don't want to be on their phones, i.e., older demographic groups, and those who do could be in different [auditoriums],\" said Meyers. \n \n In his first few months as CEO, Aron has taken other steps to ensure that AMC, known as an innovator in the movie business, stays competitive in the face of demographic shifts and rapid technological change. In March, AMC announced that it has struck a deal to acquire Carmike Cinemas (CKEC), a merger that would create the world's largest chain of movie theaters. \n \n AMC, a subsidiary of Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group, is also reportedly close to a deal with the Screening Room, a startup that will offer new releases in the home, via a set-top box that transmits movies, for $50 per view, according to Variety. \n \n The venture is controversial within the movie business, but Variety reports that the Screening Room, backed by Sean Parker of Facebook (FB) and Napster fame, is seeking to pave its way by sharing its proceeds with distributors and providing customers with two free movie tickets per view, which would help boost concession sales for theater operators. \n \n But it's the texting controversy that has put AMC in the hot seat in the eyes of some moviegoers. That is perhaps not surprising given that some people feel so strongly about the etiquette surrounding cell phone use in theaters that the issue has sparked violence. In early 2014 an argument between two men in a theater in Wesley Chapel, Florida, over texting ended in a fatal shooting. Before the argument erupted, the man who was eventually shot was sending text messages to his daughter during the previews to the movie. ||||| Tweet with a location \n \n You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications. You always have the option to delete your Tweet location history. Learn more ||||| Adam Aron has been head of AMC Entertainment for less than four months, but in that short time he\u2019s already orchestrated one of the most significant deals in the country\u2019s history. In February, AMC announced that it has an agreement to buy Carmike, propelling it from being the second-biggest exhibitor in the country to the world\u2019s top movie theater chain. \n \n Aron has a diverse resume, having been head of Starwood Hotels and Resorts, CEO and co-owner of the Philadelphia 76ers basketball team, chairman and CEO of Vail Resorts and president and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line. But in an industry dominated by lifers, he is a newcomer to the exhibition space. \n \n That\u2019s giving him a willingness to experiment. He\u2019s pushing to expand AMC\u2019s food options, bolster its loyalty program and market more aggressively. Some moves may ruffle feathers. In a bid to attract younger, smartphone savvy consumers, Aron said he was open to making some theaters texting and mobile device-friendly. \n \n That may make him unpopular. When Regal Entertainment CEO Amy Miles mused in 2012 that theaters should consider experimenting with relaxing cellphone bans, the blowback was intense. \n \n Related Movie Tickets in London Hit $50 - Here's What They Cost Around the World 'The Terror' Season 2 Adds George Takei as Series Regular, Consultant \n \n Aron sat down with Variety during CinemaCon, the annual exhibition trade show unfolding this week in Las Vegas, to discuss the planned merger with Carmike, ticketing advances and Screening Room, the controversial start-up that wants to debut movies in the home the same day they hit theaters. \n \n You\u2019ve worked in a number of different industries, but you\u2019re new to exhibition. What perspective do you bring? \n \n Coming in fresh, it seems like there\u2019s lots of opportunity to propel revenues or to give consumers better experiences. AMC has been a leader in that regard for a few years now, but I think we will pick up even more of a reputation for that going forward. Already, having been here a couple of months, I know we can step up our marketing activity in a big way. The food that we serve in our theaters can be much more exciting than the current stable of chicken tenders, hot dogs, pizza, in addition to the standard soda and popcorn and candy. A lot of change is possible in this industry for the betterment of our shareholders and our customers. \n \n Marketing costs money. Why do you think it\u2019s worth the expense? \n \n Next year, assuming the Carmike acquisition is consummated, AMC is going to have in the neighborhood of $4 billion worth of revenue. It\u2019s almost irresponsible for a company with $4 billion worth of revenue on the line not to aggressively market. That\u2019s one of the things that can ensure that the $4 billion comes in, and that\u2019s one of the things that can ensure that more than $4 billion comes in. We wouldn\u2019t be spending for additional marketing if we didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be driving big revenue gains. \n \n Are there particular demographics that you plan to target with your marketing? \n \n We ought to be looking at three things. People who are already interested in movies and maybe in a big way, where if we up our game, we could get them to come to more movies. That\u2019s one of the reasons to have a better loyalty program with bigger, broader participation, because loyalty programs work. We can convince people who think they are seeing the most movies they can possibly see to go to more movies. \n \n The second is market share we can take from our competitors if we market AMC better than they market their theaters. \n \n And third, there does seem to be a consensus that there are pockets of consumers who do not see as many movies as other segments of the population and that we can be doing more to attract those people. Millennials come to mind. We need to reshape our product in some concrete ways so that millennials go to movie theaters with the same degree of intensity as baby boomers went to movie theaters throughout their lives. \n \n Would appealing to millennials involve allowing texting or cellphone use? \n \n Yes. When you tell a 22-year-old to turn off the phone, don\u2019t ruin the movie, they hear please cut off your left arm above the elbow. You can\u2019t tell a 22-year-old to turn off their cellphone. That\u2019s not how they live their life. \n \n At the same time, though, we\u2019re going to have to figure out a way to do it that doesn\u2019t disturb today\u2019s audiences. There\u2019s a reason there are ads up there saying turn off your phone, because today\u2019s moviegoer doesn\u2019t want somebody sitting next to them texting or having their phone on. \n \n Would you have a certain section for texting? \n \n That\u2019s one possibility. What may be more likely is we take specific auditoriums and make them more texting friendly. \n \n There are reports that you have signed a letter of intent to partner with Screening Room. What is your position on the company? \n \n I\u2019m not commenting publicly on Screening Room. I know it\u2019s a topic of hot debate amongst my brethren and sister-en, and I prefer to keep our counsel private right now. Until such time as Screening Room is real, we don\u2019t have to spend a lot of time talking about it publicly. \n \n How open are you to different distribution strategies that might modify the theatrical window? \n \n For all the talk of the Paramount test a year ago [Editor\u2019s note: AMC signed a deal that allowed the studio to debut two films on home entertainment early] and all the talk of Screening Room now, you may be surprised to hear that I think windows are very important. There\u2019s a lot of evidence that shorter windows put theatrical exhibitors at risk. Studios themselves benefit from posting big global box office numbers, which comes from theatrical distribution. \n \n So I start from a general premise that I\u2019m a big fan of windows. Having said that, I\u2019m also a big fan of experimenting and testing on everything that we do to see if there aren\u2019t alternative ways of doing business. I generally look at our 385 theaters as laboratories where we can test lots of different concepts without being afraid that there\u2019s going to be a cataclysmic, sky\u2019s falling in, if we do. I believe in innovation and being imaginative and forward thinking. There are some bedrock principles though. \n \n What are those bedrock principles? \n \n I have two bedrock principles and only two bedrock principles. One is that it\u2019s our burden as managers of the company that runs movie theaters to make sure that the moviegoing experience is as wonderful and spectacular as it possibly can be. The surest way to grow our business and protect it against erosion is to make sure that going to an AMC theater is a pleasing and memorable experience. \n \n The second is the consumer is king. Giving the consumer more choices, more amenities and price points. If we put ourselves in the head of our customer and design our theatrical experience and marketing activity to make their lives better, we\u2019ll have a successful company. Other than that we\u2019ll be flexible and willing to experiment. \n \n Where are you in terms of closing the Carmike acquisition? \n \n There are really only two hurdles to go through. Carmike\u2019s shareholders have to vote to approve the transaction. I expect that\u2019s going to be some time in June. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve set a date. \n \n We need to get through the Justice Department approval, but we\u2019re optimistic that we will get through both of these hurdles. The contract we have with Carmike requires that we get through this a year from the date of the merger transaction, so early in the first quarter of 2017. It would be nice if we could get it done before that. \n \n What does the merger do for AMC? \n \n By putting together the No. 2 and No. 4 players in the industry, we create a new No. 1 player. There\u2019s extraordinary amounts of research that say that No. 1 players in industries are often the most successful players in their industries. If that turns out to be true, I\u2019d rather be the No. 1 player than the No. 2 player. \n \n Why did you recently sign a deal with ticketing app, Atom Tickets? \n \n They\u2019ve got a great social media platform where when you buy a ticket for a Wednesday night at 7:00 show, it sends a text message to all your friends asking if they want to go to the theater and sit next to you. They click a couple of buttons and your friend can buy a ticket at the same theater and showtime in a reserved seat. That\u2019s a great concept and that\u2019s one of the ways that we can make it easier for Millennials \u2014 who live on social media \u2014 to meet up with their friends in movie theaters. \n \n Megan Fox delivered a pizza to your seat during Paramount\u2019s CinemaCon presentation this week. What was that experience like? \n \n They took the pizza away as quickly as they delivered it. It was warm, and I could smell it, but we didn\u2019t get to eat it. I can\u2019t tell you how it tasted, but in terms of who and how it was delivered, I can tell you that\u2019s the best pizza delivery I\u2019ve ever had. ||||| Benvido \u00e1 casa!

    "document": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n / Updated By Corky Siemaszko \n \n More former Ohio State University wrestlers have come forward to contradict Rep. Jim Jordan\u2019s claim that he had no idea the wrestling team doctor was molesting athletes. \n \n One of the wrestlers, Shawn Dailey, said he was groped half a dozen times by Dr. Richard Strauss in the mid-1990s, when Jordan was the assistant wrestling coach. Dailey said he was too embarrassed to report the abuse directly to Jordan at the time, but he said Jordan took part in conversations where Strauss' abuse of many other team members came up. \n \n \"I participated with Jimmy and the other wrestlers in locker-room talk about Strauss. We all did,\" Dailey, 43, told NBC News, referring to Jordan. \"It was very common knowledge in the locker room that if you went to Dr. Strauss for anything, you would have to pull your pants down.\u201d \n \n Dailey spoke out two days after NBC News reported that three former wrestlers who were coached by Jordan more than two decades ago accused the GOP congressman of turning a blind eye to Strauss' alleged abuse and then lying about it. Jordan denied knowing anything about the abuse and continues to do so. \n \n Dailey corroborated the account of one of those wrestlers, Dunyasha Yetts, who told NBC News that Yetts had protested to Jordan and head coach Russ Hellickson after Strauss tried to pull down his wrestling shorts when Yetts went to see him for a thumb injury. \n \n \"Dunyasha comes back and tells Jimmy, \u2018Seriously, why do I have to pull down my pants for a thumb injury?\u2019\" Dailey recalled. \"Jimmy said something to the extent of, \u2018If he tried that with me, I would kill him.'\" \n \n Calling Jordan \u201ca close friend,\u201d Dailey said he is a Republican and that he contributed to the powerful Ohio congressman\u2019s first political campaign for state representative in 1994. \n \n \u201cWhat happened drove me out of the sport,\u201d said Dailey, a married father of two who works as a fundraiser for an Ohio college. \u201cSo I was surprised to hear Jim say that he knew nothing about it.\" \n \n \u201cJimmy\u2019s a good guy,\u201d Dailey added. \u201cBut to say that he had no knowledge of it, I would say that\u2019s kind of hurtful.\u201d \n \n Also Thursday, Mark Coleman, another former wrestler and a former UFC world champion, told The Wall Street Journal that Jordan was aware of the abuse and had not taken action. \u201cThere\u2019s no way unless he\u2019s got dementia or something that he\u2019s got no recollection of what was going on at Ohio State,\u201d said Coleman, who said he was Jordan's roommate on several wrestling trips. \n \n Jordan, via spokesman Ian Fury, has denied any knowledge of the abuse.

Messrs. Coleman... ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n / Updated By Corky Siemaszko \n \n Rep. Jim Jordan, the powerful Republican congressman from Ohio, is being accused by former wrestlers he coached more than two decades ago at Ohio State University of failing to stop the team doctor from molesting them and other students. \n \n The university announced in April that it was investigating accusations that Dr. Richard Strauss, who died in 2005, abused team members when he was the team doctor from the mid-1970s to late 1990s. \n \n Jordan, who was assistant wrestling coach at the university from 1986 to 1994, has repeatedly said he knew nothing of the abuse until former students began speaking out this spring, and continued to deny it on Tuesday. His denials, however, have been met with skepticism and anger from some former members of the wrestling team. \n \n Three former wrestlers told NBC News that it was common knowledge that Strauss showered regularly with the students and inappropriately touched them during appointments, and said it would have been impossible for Jordan to be unaware; one wrestler said he told Jordan directly about the abuse. \n \n Former head coach Russ Hellickson, Jordan's mentor, said in a recent video \u2014 made by Mike DiSabato, a former wrestler \u2014 that Hellickson had told Strauss that he was being too \"hands on\u201d with students. \n \n DiSabato, whose allegations against Strauss prompted Ohio State to open its investigation, called Jordan a \u201cliar.\u201d \n \n \u201cI considered Jim Jordan a friend,\u201d DiSabato said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, he is absolutely lying if he says he doesn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201d \n \n DiSabato said he reached out to Jordan this year, before going to the university, to tell Jordan that he planned to go public with his allegations. Jordan told him to \u201cplease leave me out of it,\u201d DiSabato said. \u201cHe asked me not to get him involved.\u201d \n \n \"At the end of the day, he is absolutely lying if he says he doesn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201d \n \n Dunyasha Yetts, who wrestled at Ohio State in 1993 and 1994, said he and others told Jordan about Strauss. \n \n \u201cI remember I had a thumb injury and went into Strauss\u2019 office and he started pulling down my wrestling shorts,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m like, what the f--- are you doing? And I went out and told Russ and Jim what happened. I was not having it. They went in and talked to Strauss.\u201d \n \n Yetts said he and his teammates talked to Jordan numerous times about Strauss. \n \n \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Strauss\u2019s locker was right next to Jordan\u2019s and Jordan even said he\u2019d kill him if he tried anything with him,\u201d Yetts said. \n \n Yetts admitted that he did time for bilking investors out of nearly $2 million. \u201cI am not a perfect person, but ask any of the wrestlers and they will tell you everybody knew about Doc,\u201d said Yetts, who served 18 months in prison. \n \n As for Jordan, Yetts said, \u201cHe\u2019s a great guy. We would have all these great talks with him and he talked about how one day he\u2019d be the president of the United States.\" \n \n \"So it\u2019s sad for me to hear that he\u2019s denying knowing about Strauss,\" he said. \"I don\u2019t know why he would, unless it\u2019s a cover-up. Either you\u2019re in on it, or you\u2019re a liar.\u201d \n \n A former teammate of DiSabato\u2019s who asked not to be identified said he never told Jordan directly that Strauss had abused him. But there is no way Jordan could have avoided the rumors \u201cbecause it was all over the locker room.\u201d \n \n \u201cI love Jimmy to death,\u201d the ex-wrestler said. \u201cIt was a head-scratcher to me why he would say he didn\u2019t know anything. Doc used to take showers with the team even though he didn\u2019t do any workouts, and everybody used to snicker about how you go into his office for a sore shoulder and he tells you to take your pants down.\u201d \n \n When the first stories about the university investigation appeared this spring, Jordan told The Columbus Dispatch, \u201cI had not heard about any type of abuse at all.\u201d He also said that \u201cno one reported any type of abuse\u201d to him. \n \n After NBC News reached out to Jordan, the congressman\u2019s spokesman repeated the denial. \n \n \u201cCongressman Jordan never saw any abuse, never heard about any abuse, and never had any abuse reported to him during his time as a coach at Ohio State,\u201d his spokesman, Ian Fury, said in an email to NBC News. \n \n Shortly after the NBC News story was published, Fury added the following statement: \"He has not been contacted by investigators about the matter but will assist them in any way they ask, because if what is alleged is true, the victims deserve a full investigation and justice.\u201d \n \n But Kathleen Trafford of Porter Wright Morris & Arthur, the Dayton, Ohio-based law firm that was appointed as legal counsel to Ohio State, said in a statement that investigators \"had previously contacted Rep. Jordan's office by email and phone to request that he participate in an interview.\" \n \n \"To date, Rep. Jordan has not responded to those requests,\" Trafford wrote. \"The investigative team is continuing its efforts to schedule an interview with Rep. Jordan.\" \n \n Jordan, a founder of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of the most conservative representatives, is a staunch ally of President Donald Trump and is frequently mentioned as a possible replacement for the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. \n \n Ryan, through his spokesman Doug Andres, also weighed in on the Ohio State investigation and Jordan's role. \n \n \"These are serious allegations and issues,\" Andres said. \"The university has rightfully initiated a full investigation into the matter. The speaker will await the findings of that inquiry.\" \n \n DiSabato forwarded to NBC News an email he sent on April 24 to Jordan and the congressman\u2019s brother, Jeff, who runs Jeff Jordan's State Champ Camp, a nationally known wrestling camp in Ohio. DiSabato sent the email 19 days after Ohio State announced on April 5 that it was investigating Strauss and the administrators of the wrestling program at the time, including the coaches, just as other colleges have done in similar circumstances. \n \n DiSabato was concerned that the university would ultimately sweep his allegations under the rug, and he wanted to ensure that Jordan would back him up. \n \n \u201cI ask you to give your full attention to the information attached to this email,\u201d DiSabato wrote. \u201cWe [are] watching you. \u2026 You have the platform to cut through the double talk, placation and finger pointing.\u201d \n \n Jordan and his brother did not reply to the email, DiSabato said. Jeff Jordan said in an email that he'd never attended or worked at Ohio State University. \n \n Rep. Jim Jordan speaks during a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill on June 28. Alex Wong / Getty Images \n \n Jim Jordan, who has made a name for himself in Congress by grilling investigators probing alleged collusion by the Trump campaign with the Russians, is among the witnesses expected to be questioned by the law firm that Ohio State hired to conduct the probe into Strauss\u2019 misconduct, officials involved with the investigation said. \n \n In the video that DiSabato made about the allegations against Strauss, which DiSabato sent to Ohio State in June, Hellickson, the former head wrestling coach, said he told school administrators about Strauss and also warned the doctor to steer clear of his wrestlers. \n \n \u201cI said, \u2018You make the guys nervous when you shower with them,\u2019\u201d Hellickson said in the video. \u201cHis response was, \u2018Coach, you shower with your guys all the time.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Not for an hour, Doc.\u2019\u201d \n \n DiSabato and his former teammates said Jordan and Hellickson were close, and if the head coach had qualms about Strauss he would have shared them with his No. 2. \n \n \u201cJim was Coach Russ\u2019 right-hand man,\u201d one former wrestler said. \n \n Hellickson, an Olympics silver medalist in wrestling in 1976 who has done commentary from the games for NBC Sports, did not return calls for comment. \n \n In response to a series of questions from NBC, Ohio State emailed a statement saying that the law firm Perkins Coie was overseeing the probe into the Strauss allegations for the university. OSU said it has also reached out \u201cto the Columbus Division of Police and the Franklin County Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s Office for any potential criminal investigation.\u201d \n \n \u201cTo date, Perkins Coie has interviewed more than 150 former students and witnesses and is engaged in further investigative efforts,\u201d the university said in the statement. \u201cOhio State has shared all additional information that has come to the attention of the university with the independent investigators whose work is ongoing.\u201d \n \n It\u2019s unclear whether former Ohio State coaches or administrators could face any penalties from the university for not protecting wrestlers from Strauss. \n \n \u201cOur efforts will continue to be focused on uncovering what may have happened during this era, what university leaders at the time may have known, and whether any response at the time was appropriate,\u201d the university\u2019s statement said. \u201cOnce the independent investigation has been completed, we will be in a position to consider what further action might be appropriate.\u201d \n \n Jordan is wrestling royalty. Born and raised in Champaign County, Ohio, he was a four-time state wrestling champion. Competing for the University of Wisconsin-Madison, he won NCAA titles in 1985 and 1986. \n \n But in the wrestling world, Jordan is best known for defeating future two-time Olympic gold medalist John Smith twice in an NCAA tournament in 1985. \n \n Jordan returned home to Ohio and \u2014 while working as a coach \u2014 earned a master\u2019s degree in education at Ohio State and later a law degree from Capital University in Columbus before launching his political career in 1994 when he was elected to the Ohio General Assembly. \n \n A 1978 employment application information for Dr. Richard Strauss, from Ohio State University personnel files. Ohio State University via AP file \n \n Strauss signed on at Ohio State as an attending physician in September 1978 and served as a team physician in the athletics department from July 1981 to June 1995, according to the university\u2019s statement. He also worked as a part-time doctor in the university\u2019s student health department from July 1994 to August 1996. \n \n After resigning from the Ohio State medical staff in 1994, Strauss stayed on as an emeritus faculty member until he retired in July 1998 and moved from Columbus to Los Angeles, the university said. \n \n Citing Los Angeles County coroner records, The Columbus Dispatch reported that Strauss died of suicide in 2005 after struggling with pain and other health issues. \n \n Strauss\u2019 relatives have not spoken publicly about the allegations since they surfaced. NBC News was not able to reach any of his relatives. \n \n DiSabato, who runs a Columbus-based sports and entertainment agency called the Profectus Group, said the recent conviction of former Olympics gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar prompted him and other Ohio State athletes to come forward about Strauss. \n \n Strauss\u2019 primary job was to give wrestlers physicals, treat them for injuries and monitor their health, DiSabato said. He said Strauss also preyed on students who played other sports. \n \n \u201cStrauss sexually assaulted male athletes in at least fifteen varsity sports during his employment at OSU from 1978 through 1998,\u201d DiSabato wrote in a June 26 email to Kathleen M. Trafford of Porter Wright Morris & Arthur, the Columbus-based law firm that represents Ohio State. \u201cAthlete victims include members of the following programs: football, basketball, wrestling, swimming, cheerleading, volleyball, lacrosse, gymnastics, ice hockey, soccer, baseball, tennis, track and cross country.\u201d \n \n Chillingly, DiSabato added: \u201cBased on testimony from victim athletes from each of the aforementioned varsity sports, we estimate that Strauss sexually assaulted and/or raped a minimum of 1,500/2,000 athletes at OSU from 1978 through 1998.\u201d \n \n Ohio State has confirmed that investigators have received \u201cconfidential reports of sexual misconduct committed by Strauss\u201d from former athletes in 14 sports and from former patients in Student Health Services. \n \n In the video, DiSabato said Strauss knew that many of the athletes were small-town kids who weren\u2019t likely to protest if the doctor told them to disrobe, for fear of losing their scholarships. He said coaches knew that Strauss was a predator. \n \n \u201cEverybody knew before you were going into the [examination] room that Doc Strauss was going to touch you,\u201d DiSabato said. \u201cIt was like a joke before you went in there.\u201d \n \n Strauss wasn\u2019t the only Ohio State official who showered with the team, DiSabato said. After practice ended at 3:30 p.m., some university professors, administrators and others would show up in the shower stalls just as the athletes were arriving, he said. \n \n It was, DiSabato said, like walking through \u201cthe gauntlet of sexual deviancy.\u201d \n \n Another former wrestler whose testimony appears on the video DiSabato submitted to investigators described how Strauss grabbed his penis during an examination. \n \n \u201cI didn\u2019t do a thing,\u201d he said when asked how he responded. \u201cProbably, because I was scared.\u201d \n \n He broke down when asked why, after all these years, he was speaking out. \n \n \u201cWhy am I doing this now? It\u2019s just hard,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want this to ever have to happen to anybody else, ever \u2026 at The Ohio State University or any school.\u201d",

Still, \"what happened drove me out of the sport,\" he says. \"So I was surprised to hear Jim say that he knew nothing about it. \u2026 That's kind of hurtful.\" Former UFC champ Mark Coleman also speaks out, telling the Wall Street Journal \"there's no way unless [Jordan's] got dementia or something that he's got no recollection of what was going on at Ohio State. \u2026 I have nothing but respect for this man, I love this man, but he knew as far as I'm concerned.\" Meanwhile, President Trump has weighed in, telling reporters Thursday that he believes Jordan \"100%, no question in my mind.\" \"Jim Jordan is one of the most outstanding people I've met since I've been in Washington,\" Trump said, adding he doesn't believe the allegations against him \"at all.\"",

Medlin said it was hard to understand her. \n \n \"The only thing we knew is it was a female that was very upset, and that she was in the trunk of the car,\" he said. \n \n The call got disconnected. He called back but could not reach the woman. \n \n Medlin then had the idea to text her from a cell phone. She responded. \n \n \"Texting, it was the only way I knew we would probably not get her in trouble,\" Medlin said. \"When I sent a simple text, 'Can you text?' She responded, 'Yes.' The immediate response after that was, 'Help me.'\" \n \n The woman was able to provide Medlin with the make and color of the vehicle and told him she believed she was headed to Fayetteville. \n \n Medlin called the Cumberland County Sheriff's office, who then contacted Verizon Wireless, and was able to locate the phone. \n \n The woman also gave authorities the name of her boyfriend - Nicholas Mattevi. \n \n Once they had a location, Fayetteville police spotted the car, rescued the woman and arrested Mattevi. \n \n \"They located her. It was a good feeling to know she was located,\" Medlin said. \n \n Jason Barbour, Johnston County's 911 director, said all 911 centers can receive text messages, but cannot initiate them, something he says needs to change. \n \n \"This is a prime example of technology being used to the fullest at someone's greatest time of need,\" Barbour said. \"We can only receive texts and then text back one another.

Dispatchers had that information from a cell phone tracking device. But, the caller wasn't able to tell dispatchers anything else valuable before the call was lost.She didn't answer when they called back. That's when Medlin had an idea. Dispatchers had a cell phone to notify supervisors if the land lines went out. He decided to use it to text the woman who called.She responded, told them she knew the man driving, and were likely headed to Fayetteville. Dispatchers sent Fayetteville police to the address. They arrested Nicholas Mattevi and charged him with false imprisonment.There was huge sigh of relief in the Johnston County 911 center.\"Okay, they're out with her. They've got them.

Johnston County 911 supervisor Tim Medlin responded, but the call got disconnected and he couldn't get in touch with the woman. \"She was crying and very upset, so it was hard to understand her at first, but [Medlin] finally heard her say she was locked in a trunk of a car,\" Barbour says. \"The call then dropped, and his multiple attempts to call her back were unsuccessful.\" Instead of giving up, Medlin used the office's emergency cellphone to text the woman. \"It was this flip phone, and [Medlin] texted the woman on that phone since he couldn't reach her by calling,\" Barbour says. \"Fortunately, she started texting back and told us that she needed help and that she believed she was in a red Mustang headed towards Fayetteville.\" The woman's boyfriend, 32-year-old Nicholas Mattevi, was arrested and charged with false imprisonment. \"He really stood by our motto, 'Failure is not an option,'\" Barbour tells WRAL. \"This is a prime example of technology being used to the fullest at someone's greatest time and money.\" (This woman was able to escape from the trunk of the car, which was able to get the car, which she was able to get to get to leave the woman to leave the woman to get the woman to get the woman to get to get the woman to get her, which she could be able to get the fact she could get the fact that she could get the fact that she could get, which they could get the fact, which they could get the fact.",

    "document": "The change comes as card fraud has more than doubled in the U.S. over the last 15 years while falling in much of the rest of the world where chip-enabled cards have been in place for much of that time. ||||| Advertisement \n \n Recently received a new credit card that has a microchip on its front? Wondering about the change? \n \n Credit cards with security chips are a part of the new card processing system being adopted by the U.S., whereby the card used by a consumer will have a special microchip that will need to be inserted in a reader rather than swiped at a checkout terminal to close a transaction. \n \n The new credit cards look like any old credit card except that they have a tiny metallic chip on the front. The chip-embedded cards deploy EMV microchips, which is short for Europay, MasterCard and Visa. This system is already in use in several parts of Europe. \n \n The microchip basically contains a user's payment information, which so far was contained on the magnetic strip. The microchip also gives a novel code which is different for every purchase. \n \n The transition to chip-enabled credit cards will make life more difficult for criminals as they are more secure than magnetic strip-only cards. \n \n How? Because the microprocessor in the microchips - which is like a mini computer - adds an additional layer of security for each transaction. \n \n According to Visa's Stephanie Erickson, Head of Authentication Product Integration, while criminals were able to make counterfeit physical copies of magnetic strip-based cards, the chip-based cards will make the process more difficult. Since the chips contain data relating to a specific purchase, their reproduction is tough. \n \n \"They can't create a counterfeit card which is two-thirds of the fraud we see in the system,\" says Erickson. \n \n Moreover, Erickson opines that countries which shifted to this technology within two years of the transition, saw the counterfeit reduce by 60 to 70 percent. \n \n Some may argue that the unique transaction code generated by the chip every single time the credit card is used may lead to a compromise. However, experts alleviate the fear by assuring that even if the code was gotten hold of by a thief it would be worthless. \n \n One, however, would still be required to sign even when deploying a chip-based card. \n \n While the new system promises more safety, a downside of the new microchip-based credit cards is that they take longer to process when compared to the older system. If an old swipe transaction took three to five seconds, then this \"dip\" method takes between five to ten seconds. \n \n The increased time for transaction would impact the lines at the checkout and could be a problem especially during high-traffic periods such as Black Friday. \n \n On Oct. 1, merchants - not card issuers - will be responsible for fraudulent transactions if they don't upgrade their payment terminals. \n \n \u00a9 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission. ||||| On Thursday, merchants who cannot process chip-enabled cards could become liable for fraudulent transactions at their stores. MasterCard and Visa set the deadline for the new rules, which are part of their agreements with the retailers and banks that use their networks. American Express will shift liability on Oct. 16. \n \n Consumers, however, will not be caught in the middle. Federal law requires banks to reimburse consumers for different types of fraud. The only difference is that, come Thursday, banks could go after retailers that have not properly updated their equipment. \n \n Not everyone will have chip-enabled cards by the deadline. While most customers at the big banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America will receive their cards by the end of the year, some will not get new cards until 2016. Some issuers will also wait until customers\u2019 existing cards are close to expiring. \n \n Credit and debit cards without chips will continue to work until they expire, or until consumers activate their new cards. And they will still work at payment terminals that have been updated to accommodate chips. \n \n But new machines will prompt users who swipe a chip card to dip it instead. \n \n \u201cYou should always use the chip device, not the swipe device,\u201d said Ed Mierzwinski, the consumer program director of U.S. PIRG, the federation of state public interest groups.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Credit card purchases are about to get a little slower and a lot more secure. Consumers have been receiving new cards with fraud-prevention chips and on Thursday, a lot more retailers will be asking customers to put their card in a reader instead of swiping it, reports the Los Angeles Times. Oct. 1 is the day that the credit card industry will start shifting liability for fraudulent transactions to issuers and merchants that haven't adopted the new technology, which is already used in much of the rest of the world and is credited with dramatically reducing fraud by making it harder to duplicate cards. Cards without chips will continue to work until they expire, though experts tell the New York Times that consumers who have the choice should always opt to dip a card in a reader instead of swiping it. The chips in the new cards use a system known as EMV, for creators Europay, MasterCard, and Visa. They contain buyer information and add an extra level of security by creating a new code for every purchase, Tech Times explains. In Europe, consumers need to enter a PIN, but US retailers will only require signatures. Around 70% of cards will have chips by the end of this year, according to the LA Times, though the full switch is expected to take years. Retailers worry that the extra few seconds per purchase will slow down businesses at peak times\u2014and that more fraud will now take place online. \"It's like closing the front door but leaving the back door open,\" a National Retail Federation exec tells the New York Times. \"The thieves will figure out that the back door is unlocked.\"",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 If you've got a MasterCard, Visa, or American Express card, there's a good chance you'll soon be asked to dip it in front of a reader instead of swiping it at a store checkout. That's because Thursday is the deadline for retailers to update their payment terminals to accept chip-enabled cards, which MasterCard and Visa are rolling out in the US later this year, the Wall Street Journal reports. The change, which Visa says will make credit card transactions more secure, is part of a drive to cut down on credit card fraud, which has more than doubled in the US over the past 15 years, Tech Times reports. But while the new cards are more secure than magnetic strip-based cards, they're also pricier, taking between five and 10 seconds to process compared to three to five seconds with the old system, which could lead to longer checkout lines during high-traffic periods such as Black Friday. Banks and retailers aren't required to reimburse consumers for fraudulent transactions, but they could go after retailers that don't update their equipment, the Journal notes.

    "document": "DULUTH, Minn. - Authorities are releasing more information about the elderly Duluth couple found dead on Saturday. \n \n Duluth police say Ron Tarnowski, 82, and Mary Tarnowski, 78, were found on Saturday shortly before 4 p.m., after they were missing for eight days. \n \n A U.S. Border Patrol Helicopter found their vehicle in a rural area about 150 yards off of Highway 2 in the Brookston, Minnesota area. St. Louis County Sheriff's Office Sgt. Wade Rasch says it appears the couple drove off the road onto a swampy trail that was likely only used as a snowmobile trail during the winter. \n \n Rasch said Mary Tarnowski was found in the car, which was stuck on the trail, and Ron Tarnowski was found closer to the highway. Rasch said it appears Ron went to get help after the car became stuck. \n \n RELATED: Police seek help finding missing Duluth couple \n \n The autopsy results are pending, but Rasch said it's likely the couple died of exposure. \n \n A post on the Find Ron and Mary Tarnowski Facebook page stated, \"It is with great sadness that we must report that Ron and Mary Tarnowski have been found deceased in a remote area about a mile from their hunting camp.\" \n \n The couple had been last seen on surveillance video at a Country Corner store near Brookston, Minnesota, around 1 p.m. on Saturday, July 29. \n \n Ron had early-stage dementia, and Mary had right-sided paralysis, making it difficult to speak. ||||| After a week-long search, Ron and Mary Tarnowski were discovered dead in swampy area in Duluth on Aug. 5. The couple was married for 59 years. (Amber Ferguson/The Washington Post) \n \n Ron and Mary Tarnowski spent their days confined almost entirely to their home in Duluth, Minn. \n \n Decades ago, at age 42, Mary Tarnowski suffered from a stroke that left her paralyzed on the right side of her body, making it difficult for her to move or speak. Her husband, Ron, served as her caretaker for more than 35 years, assisting her with daily tasks and rarely leaving her side. \n \n But in recent years, Ron Tarnowski, an Air Force veteran and retired captain for the local fire department, began showing signs of early-stage dementia, his son and police told The Washington Post. Suddenly, the tough man with a \u201ccommanding presence,\u201d adventurous spirit and the build of a former football player needed to be taken care of, too. \n \n Getting around became even more difficult for the Tarnowskis \u2014 Mary, 78, and Ron, 81. The couple hardly ever left the home, which their son, Karl Tarnowski, built adjacent to his own so he could keep an eye on them. \n \n Occasionally, Mary Tarnowski would ask her husband to go for a drive, perhaps to nearby restaurants. But they never stayed away for very long and would always be back well before nightfall. \n \n \u201cWhen the sun sets they\u2019ve always been home,\u201d Karl Tarnowski, the younger of the couple\u2019s two sons, said in an interview with The Washington Post. \n \n So it was troubling when, on the evening of July 29, Karl Tarnowski and his wife found the elderly couple\u2019s home empty and their Chevy Tahoe gone. \n \n Mary and Ron Tarnowski had driven away that day without telling anyone. They left behind a cellphone, Mary\u2019s wheelchair and purse, and their medications. At 10 p.m., their worried children called the police to report them missing. \n \n For the next seven days, the family, law enforcement and hundreds of community members in Duluth launched an extensive search effort that covered thousands of miles. \n \n Relatives and local authorities posted fliers all over the surrounding area and posted updates on a Facebook group called \u201cFind Ron and Mary Tarnowski,\u201d which was followed by more than 7,000 people across Minnesota and the United States. Retired Duluth firefighters joined the search for one of their own. \n \n Duluth residents tied purple ribbons around trees and on businesses, in honor of the Alzheimer\u2019s Association. They held news conferences outside the Tarnowskis\u2019 home attended by the Duluth police chief and about 100 community members. \n \n Relatives and police officials weighed several possible theories of where the couple could have gone. Perhaps they had headed northwest to Grand Rapids, Minn., where their sons had been spending the day. Maybe they were stopping by their family\u2019s hunting shack, about 30 miles away from their Duluth home. \n \n On Saturday afternoon, eight days after the couple went missing, the family received their answer, and a tragic end to their strenuous search. A U.S. Border Patrol helicopter found the couple\u2019s Chevy Tahoe on an overgrown, abandoned driveway in a swampy area off the road just two miles away from the family\u2019s hunting property. They were near Brookston, a town about 30 miles from their Duluth home. \n \n Mary\u2019s Tarnowski\u2019s body was discovered inside the Tahoe, and her husband\u2019s body was found outside the vehicle, about 50 feet from the road. \n \n Authorities suspect Ron Tarnowski may have driven onto the trail accidentally before getting his car stuck in the mud, said Lt. Mike Ceynowa, public information officer for the Duluth Police Department. He said police think Tarnowski left the vehicle to seek help. \n \n Autopsy results are pending, but Karl Tarnowski said there are signs that his mother died of a combination of dehydration and heat while sitting in the car on a day with temperatures in the upper 80s. There is also evidence that Ron Tarnowski had fallen down while trudging through the mud, his son said. \n \n Both are believed to have died July 29, the day they went missing, the son said. No foul play is suspected, according to authorities. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a horrific case,\u201d Ceynowa said. \u201cNobody wants to lose their parents this way.\u201d \n \n But in the parents\u2019 final moments, Ceynowa said, Ron Tarnowski \u201cwas doing what he\u2019s done for years: trying to help his wife and take care of her.\u201d \n \n Karl Tarnowski does not know what prompted his parents to drive so far away, but he suspects his father\u2019s dementia played a role. His father rarely visited the hunting cabin in recent years, and he never traveled there without one of his two sons. Even then, he would be on edge, wanting to hurry home before sundown to take care of his wife. \n \n The morning before they went missing, \u201ceverything seemed totally normal,\u201d Karl Tarnowski said. His wife gave his mother a bath and cooked the couple some breakfast. Later that morning, he left town for the day, telling his father, \u201cSee you later, Papa.\u201d \n \n \u201cHe said, \u2018Take your time, but hurry back,'\u201d Tarnowski said. \u201cHe said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be here anyway. We never go anywhere.\u201d \n \n Evidence uncovered during the course of the seven-day search revealed some details about the rest of their day. The couple stopped by a local Wells Fargo Bank, where Ron Tarnowski withdrew an amount of cash typical for him. Then they stopped at a restaurant for lunch, Karl Tarnowski said. \n \n The map shows the distance from Ron and Mary Tarnowski\u2019s home to where their bodies were found. (Google Maps) \n \n At some point afterward, they headed northwest on Highway 2 toward their hunting property. It was a \u201cbeautiful\u201d summer day, Ceynowa said, \u201ca day we all hope for in the north.\u201d \n \n A video from security cameras showed the couple in one of their final moments, walking through a bar and grill in Brookston, Minn., possibly hours before their vehicle got stuck. \n \n The surveillance footage captured the extent of the couple\u2019s immobility. They could be seen slowly walking into the restaurant. Ron Tarnowski led the way, trudging along with his cane and holding his wife\u2019s hand as she walked behind him, dragging a leg. It took 16 minutes for the couple to take a bathroom break, Karl Tarnowski said. \n \n They had been married for 59 years. \n \n Lately, caring for his wife had became a taxing responsibility for Ron Tarnowski. And in recent years, his mental deterioration became a challenge for his wife, their son said. \n \n But throughout these tribulations, Karl Tarnowski said, \u201ctheir love was outstanding for one another.\u201d \n \n Ron Tarnowski joined the Air Force before graduating from high school and was stationed in the Philippines for a long time, his son said. He actively volunteered with the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic fraternal organization. As a father, he could be a \u201ckind of harsh person\u201d at times, but he had a \u201cheart of gold,\u201d Karl Tarnowski said. \n \n His father often offered to work on welding projects for neighbors and friends, and would always say \u201cthis weld is guaranteed,\u201d Tarnowski recounted. \u201cIf it breaks, I\u2019ll weld it again.\u201d \n \n Mary Tarnowski was a \u201cbig-hearted\u201d mother who \u201cloved people\u201d and always looked forward to playing cards with friends. Before her stroke, she volunteered with the census every 10 years, participated in her children\u2019s parent-teacher associations and made sure everything in the home was organized. She never had a driver\u2019s license, so her husband would frequently drive her around town. \n \n \u201cThey went everywhere together,\u201d said Mark Lavalier, a retired firefighter who worked with Ron Tarnowski for several years and who assisted with the search efforts. \u201cYou\u2019d never see one without the other.\u201d \n \n The story of the missing couple resonated with families across the state, particularly those with elderly parents, Lavalier said. \n \n \u201cEverybody\u2019s got parents.

The investigation into the deaths was ongoing Saturday night, but foul play wasn\u2019t suspected. It appeared the couple\u2019s SUV had gotten stuck, police said. \n \n They were found about a mile from the family\u2019s hunting camp, according to a statement posted on the \u201cFind Ron and Mary Tarnowski\u201d Facebook page that family members had started to aid the search. The camp is near U.S. Highway 2 between Brookston and Floodwood, and a few miles from where the couple had been last seen, the Country Corner store. \n \n \u201cThe family would like to thank the many men and women of law enforcement, the active and retired firefighters, the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, and the overwhelming support of the community and the media for the diligent efforts this past week,\u201d the Facebook statement read. \n \n Aircraft involved in the search had been grounded Friday because of thunderstorms in the region, officials said, but returned to the air on Saturday. \n \n The news prompted an outpouring of condolences and support on social media for the Tarnowski family \u2014 including the couple\u2019s sons, Kurt and Karl, and Karl\u2019s wife Bev \u2014 who had been tireless in recent days in organizing search efforts and checking on possible sightings. \n \n Ron, 82, and Mary, 78, had been last seen July 29 at the Country Corner store along Highway 2. Ron was in the early stages of dementia, and Mary suffered from right-side paralysis and had difficulty speaking. They lived in a home Karl Tarnowski built for his parents, adjacent to his own home in Duluth. They generally spent most of their time at home, going out only for an occasional meal at nearby restaurants. \n \n They weren\u2019t carrying cellphones or credit cards when they went missing, and an OnStar system in their vehicle was not activated, which left authorities with few clues to pinpoint a search over the past week. \n \n \u201cWe're not looking for a needle in a haystack, because we haven't found the haystack yet,\u201d Duluth Police Chief Mike Tusken said at a Saturday morning gathering at the Tarnowskis\u2019 home. \n \n More than 100 volunteers, some wearing purple T-shirts and ribbons for Alzheimer\u2019s awareness, gathered in Ron and Mary\u2019s driveway to begin another day of searching for the couple Saturday. A photo of Ron and Mary was taped to their garage with a sign above it: \u201cMissing 8 days.\u201d \n \n About 20 current and retired Duluth firefighters were among the crowd of volunteers to search for one of their own. Ron was a Duluth firefighter for 31 years. \n \n Retired Duluth firefighters Jim Reed and Mark Lavalier had already been out searching in the past week. Lavalier worked with Ron and lives one block south of the Tarnowskis. Trying to hold back tears on Saturday morning, before the couple was found, he said, \u201cIf it was me, I know that they\u2019d be there for me.\u201d \n \n Reed didn\u2019t know Ron well, but said \u201cnobody deserves this, to be lost\u201d and to be confused with dementia. \n \n Law enforcement\u2019s efforts to find the Tarnowskis ramped up on Saturday with a new emergency command center set up in Pike Lake and a new tip line with two dispatchers dedicated to the case. \n \n During the Saturday morning gathering, Tusken said the police department\u2019s violent crimes unit, which handles missing person cases, had been working on the case since Day One and had tracked down dozens of leads in six counties and two states. \n \n The police department decided to change tactics on Friday night due to the expanding search for the couple, and the command center created a centralized location for the various agencies assisting in the search. \n \n At the command center on Saturday, before the Tarnowskis were found, there was a steady stream of phone calls with tips and search updates. \n \n Law enforcement officials studied a gas station\u2019s surveillance video, cross-referencing it with Google Maps and a tip to determine the likelihood that Ron and Mary\u2019s vehicle might have been captured on the video. \n \n On the wall, areas already searched were being marked on a large map of Northeastern Minnesota. Authorities had notified FedEx, UPS and rural mail carriers to keep an eye out, and some student pilots had flown over the region to search while getting in their practice hours. \n \n Reed, the retired Duluth firefighter who had gathered with dozens of other volunteers Saturday morning at the Tarnowskis\u2019 home, said at that time that the community response \u201cis a big circle. Hopefully somebody will do it for us or one of our loved ones if it happened to them. That\u2019s how we do it.

By the afternoon, a helicopter had found both the haystack and the needle, to tragic ends. Ron and Mary Tarnowski were found dead in the Brookston area, near a hunting shack the family owned about 30 miles from Duluth. Foul play isn't suspected. The Washington Post reports the couple lived near one of their sons, Karl Tarnowski, who noticed they uncharacteristically didn't return home on July 29. The Duluth News Tribune reports the couple didn't have cellphones or credit cards on them, nor did their car's OnStar system engage, leaving authorities with little to go on. But there was, perhaps, a general area: Their last sighting had been at 1pm on the day they went missing at a corner store near Brookston. KARE reports the Tarnowskis' Chevy Tahoe was found in a remote area, apparently stuck on what seemed to be a \"swampy\" trail typically accessed by snowmobilers in the winter. Mary, 78, was in the vehicle; Ron, 82, was outside it, some 50 feet from the road, suggesting he had gone in search of help. Karl tells the Post that it's thought both died the day they went missing; Mary is believed to have succumbed to dehydration and heat. The couple is depicted as a devoted one: A stroke at age 42 left Mary paralyzed on her right side; Ron was constantly by her side, but had himself begun to show early signs of dementia.

For us Ramadan is a really special time so it's really important to make people happy and reward them,\" said Hussain. \n \n His show -- Aman Ramazan -- has been dubbed Pakistan's version of The Price Is Right, with members of the 500-strong audience receiving prizes in exchange for answering questions on the Quran. \n \n The giveaway bonanza includes motorbikes, microwave ovens, washing machines and fridges. \n \n He also cooks while men sing Islamic hymns and discusses religion with children in a garden full of rabbits, snakes and goats. \n \n The baby girls given away on the show were found by an NGO, the Chhipa Welfare Association , which says it receives up to 15 abandoned babies a month. \n \n \"Our team finds babies abandoned on the street, in garbage bins -- some of them dead, others mauled by animals. So why not ensure the baby is kept alive and gets a good home?\" said Ramzan Chhipa, who runs the organization. \n \n \"We didn't just give the baby away. We have our own vetting procedure. This couple was already registered with us and had four or five sessions with us.\" \n \n But, the couple didn't know they would be handed a newborn when they were invited to take part in the show and paperwork was not processed before the live broadcast. \n \n Adoption is not officially recognized in Pakistan and there is no adoption law. The couple will have to apply for guardianship at a family court. \n \n Some viewers praised the show's baby giveaway but others declared it a publicity stunt. \n \n \"Pakistan wake up,\" Shamim Mahmood wrote on the NGO's Facebook page. \"Babies are not trophies to be handed to just anyone.\" \n \n Hussain says it isn't a gimmick to win ratings during the Islamic holy month. He believes his show is unifying a fractured nation, plagued by sectarian violence, religious intolerance and terrorism. \n \n \"These are the disenfranchised babies that grow up to be street kids and used for suicide bombing attacks. We have tried to show an alternative,\" he said. \n \n \"Telling people to take these kids off the rubbish on the streets, raise them and make them a responsible citizen, not to destroy society through terrorism,\" he said. \n \n The show has proved extremely popular, breaking ratings records and may be extended beyond its Ramadan run. He is also planning another program where the audience will be from the minority Hindu, Sikh and Christian communities. \n \n \"We've created a symbol of peace and love, that's our show's theme -- to spread love.

A childless couple kisses their newly adopted daughter, Fatima, whom Pakistani television talk show host Aamir Liaquat Hussain gave them on his show, as they sit at the Chhipa Welfare Association office in Karachi August 1, 2013. \n \n ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistani television is screening what many call its most controversial content yet in a ruthless quest for ratings: a talk-show host who gives away babies live on air. \n \n Aamir Liaquat Hussain, a bespectacled 41-year-old with a neatly trimmed beard, gave away two abandoned infant girls to childless families last month and plans to give away a baby boy this week. \n \n \"If we didn't find this baby, a cat or a dog would have eaten it,\" Hussain proclaimed during one broadcast, before presenting a tiny girl wrapped in pink and red to her new parents. The audience erupted with applause. \n \n Hussain is one of Pakistan's most popular talk-show hosts. During his marathon broadcasts he cooks, interviews clerics and celebrities, entertains children and hosts game shows. \n \n He usually gives prizes like motorbikes, mobile phones and land deeds to audience members who answer questions about Islam. \n \n But at the beginning of the holy Muslim month of Ramadan, when television stations battle fiercely for ratings, Hussain astonished Pakistan when he presented two families with babies. \n \n \"We were told that we had passed all the interviews and had been selected to adopt a baby,\" said Riaz Uddin, 40, an engineer. \"We got our baby on live TV.\" \n \n The abandoned babies were rescued by the Chhipa Welfare Association, a Pakistani aid organization. \n \n \"In a day or two, the next baby will be given away, God willing,\" its head, Ramzan Chhipa, told Reuters on Thursday. \n \n While the Chhipa teams scour the garbage dumps and other sites for discarded newborns, Hussain is also appealing for babies directly. \n \n \"If any family cannot afford to bring up their new born baby due to poverty or illness then instead of killing them, they should hand over the baby to Dr Aamir,\" a notice on his website reads. The children would be given to deserving couples on air, the notice said. \n \n The show's producers did not return Reuters calls seeking comment. It was not clear if poor families wishing to keep their children would also be helped. \n \n FIGHTING FOR VIEWERS \n \n Many Pakistanis expressed disgust that abandoned babies were being given away in what they see as an attempt to boost ratings. Chhipa insisted thousands of people wanted a baby and all potential parents were properly vetted. \n \n The true outrage, he said, was the poverty forcing families to abandon children. \n \n Hussain's show is one of many such broadcasts. The Pakistani media has flourished over the past decade or so following the liberalization of the industry, particularly broadcasting, after decades of tight state control. \n \n Now, instead of battling state restrictions, presenters fight for audiences and advertising by seeing who is most outrageous. \n \n Recent episodes include a female anchor stalking couples in a park to challenge their morality, and a news program which once ran a live broadcast showing a staff member bleeding to death in an operating theatre after he was shot in a riot. \n \n Even among this company, Hussain stands out. In 2008, he hosted scholars who called for the deaths of Ahmadis, a persecuted religious sect in Pakistan. Within a day, two prominent Ahmadis had been shot dead. \n \n The year before, he had to resign from his post as junior minister for religious affairs after denouncing author Salman Rushdie for blasphemy, a crime punished by death in Pakistan. \n \n Since then, his university degree has been exposed as a fake and a video showing him making crude jokes with clerics between takes of his show has leaked onto YouTube. \n \n \"There is nothing they won't do to get viewers,\" said comedian Sami Shah. \"If I was a cynic, I'd say this can only end badly. But since I'm a realist, I'll say it's already ended terribly.\" \n \n (Additional reporting by Zeeshan Ahmed; Editing by Robert Birsel)",

Marcus Merritt, testified Wednesday that Holcomb addressed him with a racial slur and threatened to \"kill me and put me in a body bag and send me home.\u2019\u2019 Merritt said he became suicidal after enduring punishment and humiliation from Holcomb. \n \n In their opening statements, prosecutors had said testimony would show that soldiers taunted Chen with racial slurs, kicked him and pelted him with rocks in merciless hazing in the weeks before the private\u2019s suicide. \n \n Holcomb, 30, is the first to face court-martial in a case that has focused renewed attention on allegations of hazing and racism in the Army, where Asian Americans are a distinct minority. Courts-martial for the other seven soldiers, including an officer, are scheduled for later this year. \n \n Military prosecutors elicited the testimony in the second day of the proceedings to buttress charges that Holcomb hazed and hounded Chen, a Chinese American, into committing suicide at a remote combat outpost in Afghanistan on Oct. 3. Holcomb, one of eight soldiers charged in connection with Chen\u2019s death, faces charges of negligent homicide, assault, reckless endangerment and other counts. \n \n FT. BRAGG, N.C. -- Sgt. Adam Holcomb bombarded Danny Chen, a shy, 19-year-old Army private, with racial slurs and bloodied Chen\u2019s back by dragging him across rocky ground for disobeying a platoon rule, several former members of Holcomb\u2019s platoon testified at his court-martial Wednesday. \n \n U.S. Army Sgt. Adam Holcomb, right, is the first of eight men facing prosecution\u2026 (Raul R. Rubiera, The Fayetteville\u2026) \n \n \"He was in my face constantly,\u2019\u2019 Merritt testified when asked why he had contemplated suicide. \"All the stuff he did had a long-lasting effect on me.\u2019\u2019 \n \n Under cross-examination, Merritt conceded that he knew Holcomb wasn\u2019t serious about killing him. But he also said he feared the sergeant, telling a military psychiatrist he wanted to kill Holcomb. \n \n Holcomb\u2019s immediate superior, Staff Sgt. Darren Holt, told the military panel of 10 officers and non-commissioned officers that he confronted Holcomb after the sergeant dragged Chen across sharp, baseball-sized rocks in late September. Holcomb was angry that Chen had ignored posted rules to turn off power to a water heater after taking a shower. \n \n Holt said he told Holcomb that physically abusing a soldier was wrong and reported the incident to superiors. \"I verbally counseled him [Holcomb] . . . and made it clear that was unacceptable,\u2019\u2019 Holt said. \n \n Chen shot himself under the chin in a base guard tower a week after the dragging incident, according to the Army. \n \n Chen\u2019s death outraged some Chinese American activists in New York City\u2019s Chinatown, where Chen grew up with his immigrant parents. Several activists are attending the court-martial, along with journalists from China. \n \n Holcomb\u2019s military lawyers have said Chen killed himself because his parents had disowned him for joining the Army instead of attending college. They have portrayed Chen as an incompetent soldier who endangered his platoon and required constant discipline for such violations as sleeping on guard duty or reporting for his guard post without his helmet. \n \n Defense lawyers have also said that nicknames -- even those with racially tinged overtones -- were common \"terms of endearment\u2019\u2019 in the small, tight-knit platoon. One African American platoon member, they said, encouraged soldiers to call him \"Black Mamba.\u2019\u2019 \n \n Under cross-examination by the defense, former members of the platoon conceded that most discipline meted out by Holcomb was justified by Chen\u2019s failure to follow orders or regulations. Such \"corrective training,\u2019\u2019 especially in combat zones, is an accepted way to improve soldiers\u2019 performance, according to testimony. \n \n Several soldiers testified that Chen never gave any overt indication that he was contemplating suicide. The platoon medic, Spec. Zachary Bolin, who treated Chen\u2019s back abrasions at Holcomb\u2019s request, said Chen denied suicidal thoughts when Bolin asked him about it. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

With more people leaving the service, the company, which Facebook bought for $735 million this year, reacted again by returning to the old rules. \n \n Acknowledging those concerns late Thursday, Mr. Systrom wrote: \u201cI want to be really clear: Instagram has no intention of selling your photos, and we never did. We don\u2019t own your photos \u2014 you do.\u201d \n \n Mr. Systrom said the company would still be tweaking its privacy policy to quell users\u2019 fears that their photos might pop-up on third-party sites without their consent. \n \n But Mr. Systrom did not clarify how Instagram planned to monetize its service in the future. Facebook is under pressure to make Instagram earn income. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a free service \u2014 they have to monetize somewhere,\u201d said John Casasanta, a principal at Tap Tap Tap, the maker of Camera+, a photo-filter app that has shunned advertising and instead charges users for premium features. \u201cThe days of the simple banner ads are gone. Their user data is too valuable.\u201d \n \n It was unclear whether reverting its terms of service would be enough to satisfy high-profile users like National Geographic, which stopped using its Instagram account in light of the moves, or other users who have aired their grievances on Twitter and Facebook. \n \n The controversy has driven traffic and new users to several other photo-sharing applications. \n \n Pheed, an Instagram-like app that gives users the option to monetize their own content by charging followers to see their posts, gained more users than any other app in the United States on Thursday. By Thursday morning, Pheed had jumped to the ninth most downloaded social-networking app in Apple\u2019s iTunes store, just ahead of LinkedIn. \n \n O. D. Kobo, Pheed\u2019s chief executive, said Thursday morning that subscriptions to the service had quadrupled this week and that in the last 24 hours users had uploaded 300,000 new files to the service \u2014 more uploads than any other 24-hour-period since Pheed made its debut six weeks ago. \n \n Another runaway success was Flickr, Yahoo\u2019s photo-sharing service, which redesigned its app last week to make it easier to share photos on Twitter. In a stroke of good fortune, it released the app to positive reviews just as Instagram announced it would no longer sync with Twitter, a Facebook rival. \n \n The day before Instagram announced changes to its terms of service, Flickr\u2019s mobile app was ranked at around 175 in Apple\u2019s overall iTunes app charts. Since that day, the application skyrocketed to the high 20s. \n \n Of course, most of these services are still tiny compared to Instagram, which claims to have more than 100 million members who have uploaded upward of 5 billion photos using its service. And it was unclear if the services\u2019 newfound members had also deleted their Instagram accounts or were merely dabbling in other offerings. But the migration, whether temporary or permanent, was a reminder of the volatility of success and that the fall to bottom can sometimes be as swift as the rise to the top. \n \n Facebook and Instagram declined to say whether they had seen any significant number of account deletions or if they were concerned about losing ground in the photo-sharing market to rivals. Some photo apps took direct aim at Instagram. Camera+ even went so far as to include a snide, holiday-themed reference to Instagram\u2019s stumbles in an app update on Wednesday. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019ll never do shady things with your shared pics, because it just isn\u2019t right,\u201d the update noted. \u201cOn that note, happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!\u201d",

(AP) \u2014 Drivers who drink coffee behind the wheel don't need to worry about getting a ticket in New Jersey any time soon. \n \n The sponsor of a bill targeting distracted driving says his measure doesn't specifically cite coffee, despite recent news reports focusing on the beverage. \n \n Democratic Assemblyman John Wisniewski said the legislation is aimed at discouraging distracted driving and that he cannot imagine that a police officer would pull anyone over for drinking coffee. \n \n Current law already prohibits texting or talking without a hands-free device. The new legislation is broader and would bar \"any activity unrelated to the actual operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that interferes with the safe operation of the vehicle.\" \n \n Wisniewski says he sponsored the bill , which doesn't mention eating or drinking, to avoid the need for new legislation every time technology changes. \n \n He introduced the measure seven months ago, but he has yet to bring it up for a vote in a committee he leads. It also never came up for a vote in the two previous legislative sessions in which he introduced similar bills. \n \n Wisniewski said he was surprised by the reaction to the legislation. He said the outcry against the bill has been so strong that his inbox has filled up even more than when he proposed a 25-cent-per-gallon increase in the gas tax. \n \n Wisniewski said when he introduced the bill before, people worried he was trying to stop them from eating sandwiches while driving. \n \n \"It was the 'ham sandwich bill' last time,\" he said. \"Now it's coffee.\" ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| Put down the coffee, bagel or hairbrush and drive! Or else! \n \n A bill winding its way through Trenton would impose stiff fines and even a possible license suspension for drivers who eat, drink, groom, read or use electronic devices behind the wheel. \n \n Violators could face a $200 to $400 fine for the first offense and a $400 to $600 fine for a second offense. A third or subsequent offense could mean a fine of $600 to $800 and up to a 90 day license suspension, as well as motor vehicle points. \n \n The sponsors of the bill, Assemblyman John Wisniewski, D- Middlesex and Nicholas Chiaravalloti, D-Hudson, said it is modeled after a law in Maine and is intended to educate, not punish drivers. \n \n \"The issue is that we need to try, in every way, to discourage distracted driving, it's dangerous,\" Wisniewski said. \"Education and enforcement can change the attitudes of people.\" \n \n Some experts say that motorists must be discouraged from multitasking while driving. Others say the bill is an overreach and questioned how police could enforce it. \n \n \"This proposed distracted driving law is not needed, since three statutes can be used when a distraction causes unsafe actions, like swerving or crossing a line,\" said Steve Carrellas, policy and government affairs director for the National Motorists Association state chapter. \"There is unsafe driving, careless driving and reckless driving.\" \n \n Supporters of the bill must come to terms with the fact that a certain level of multitasking by drivers is a reality, Carrellas said. \n \n \"Would [the bill] make changing the radio station or adjusting the volume illegal? What about talking to a passenger?\" Carrellas asked. \n \n Arnold Anderson, the Essex County Community Traffic Safety Program coordinator, said its imperative that motorists break the habit of doing more than one thing while driving. \n \n \"You've got to get people out of the mindset of multitasking,\" said Arnold Anderson, \" You can't multitask. We are so far away from the mindset of ... just drive.\" \n \n This kills more drivers than anything else \n \n Officials from AAA said that a distraction law would be hard to enforce since an officer would have to observe how the driver was distracted, but also that the bill may have a higher purpose. \n \n \"The legislation introduced by Assemblyman Wisniewski, while admirable in theory, may not help police enforce the law,\" said Tracy Noble, AAA Mid-Atlantic spokeswoman. \n \n \n \n But a distraction law could have a similar effect as seat belt laws, which Noble and Anderson credited for increasing seat belt use in the state, even without fines. \n \n \n \n \"The more widespread the message of eliminating distractions becomes, the more likely it is to be ingrained in everyday behavior, similar to seat belt usage,\" Noble said. \n \n Currently, New Jersey has laws banning the use of hand-held cell phones and texting while driving, but no prohibitions of other behavior that is considered distracting, according to the state Division of Highway Traffic Safety. \n \n Larry Higgs may be reached at lhiggs@njadvancemedia.com .

    "document": "Marketers and manufacturers that promote their products as Made in USA must meet the \u201call or virtually all\u201d standard. This publication offers practical guidance on Made in USA claims. \n \n Introduction \n \n The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is charged with preventing deception and unfairness in the marketplace. The FTC Act gives the Commission the power to bring law enforcement actions against false or misleading claims that a product is of U.S. origin. Traditionally, the Commission has required that a product advertised as Made in USA be \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S. After a comprehensive review of Made in USA and other U.S. origin claims in product advertising and labeling, the Commission announced in December 1997 that it would retain the \"all or virtually all\" standard. The Commission also issued an Enforcement Policy Statement on U.S. Origin Claims to provide guidance to marketers who want to make an unqualified Made in USA claim under the \"all or virtually all\" standard and those who want to make a qualified Made in USA claim. \n \n This publication provides additional guidance about how to comply with the \"all or virtually all\" standard. It also offers some general information about the U.S. Customs Service\u2019s requirement that all products of foreign origin imported into the U.S. be marked with the name of the country of origin. \n \n This publication is the Federal Trade Commission staff\u2019s view of the law\u2019s requirements. It is not binding on the Commission. The Enforcement Policy Statement issued by the FTC is at the end of the publication. \n \n Basic Information About Made In USA Claims \n \n Must U.S. content be disclosed on products sold in the U.S.? \n \n U.S. content must be disclosed on automobiles and textile, wool, and fur products. There\u2019s no law that requires most other products sold in the U.S. to be marked or labeled Made in USA or have any other disclosure about their amount of U.S. content. However, manufacturers and marketers who choose to make claims about the amount of U.S. content in their products must comply with the FTC\u2019s Made in USA policy. \n \n What products does the FTC\u2019s Made in USA policy apply to? \n \n The policy applies to all products advertised or sold in the U.S., except for those specifically subject to country-of-origin labeling by other laws. Other countries may have their own country-of-origin marking requirements. As a result, exporters should determine whether the country to which they are exporting imposes such requirements. \n \n What kinds of claims does the Enforcement Policy Statement apply to? \n \n The Enforcement Policy Statement applies to U.S. origin claims that appear on products and labeling, advertising, and other promotional materials. It also applies to all other forms of marketing, including marketing through digital or electronic mechanisms, such as Internet or e-mail. \n \n A Made in USA claim can be express or implied. \n \n Examples of express claims: Made in USA. \"Our products are American-made.\" \"USA.\" \n \n In identifying implied claims, the Commission focuses on the overall impression of the advertising, label, or promotional material. Depending on the context, U.S. symbols or geographic references (for example, U.S. flags, outlines of U.S. maps, or references to U.S. locations of headquarters or factories) may convey a claim of U.S. origin either by themselves, or in conjunction with other phrases or images. \n \n Example: A company promotes its product in an ad that features a manager describing the \"true American quality\" of the work produced at the company\u2019s American factory. Although there is no express representation that the company\u2019s product is made in the U.S., the overall \u2014 or net \u2014 impression the ad is likely to convey to consumers is that the product is of U.S. origin. \n \n Brand names and trademarks \n \n Ordinarily, the Commission will not consider a manufacturer or marketer\u2019s use of an American brand name or trademark by itself as a U.S. origin claim. Similarly, the Commission is not likely to interpret the mere listing of a company\u2019s U.S. address on a package label in a non-prominent way as a claim of U.S. origin. \n \n Example: A product is manufactured abroad by a well-known U.S. company. The fact that the company is headquartered in the U.S. also is widely known. Company pamphlets for its foreign-made product prominently feature its brand name. Assuming that the brand name does not specifically denote U.S. origin (that is, the brand name is not \"Made in America, Inc.\"), using the brand name by itself does not constitute a claim of U.S. origin. \n \n Representations about entire product lines \n \n Manufacturers and marketers should not indicate, either expressly or implicitly, that a whole product line is of U.S. origin (\"Our products are made in USA\") when only some products in the product line are made in the U.S. according to the \"all or virtually all\" standard. \n \n Does the FTC pre-approve Made in USA claims? \n \n The Commission does not pre-approve advertising or labeling claims. A company doesn\u2019t need approval from the Commission before making a Made in USA claim. As with most other advertising claims, a manufacturer or marketer may make any claim as long as it is truthful and substantiated. \n \n The Standard For Unqualified Made In USA Claims \n \n What is the standard for a product to be called Made in USA without qualification? \n \n For a product to be called Made in USA, or claimed to be of domestic origin without qualifications or limits on the claim, the product must be \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S. The term \"United States,\" as referred to in the Enforcement Policy Statement, includes the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories and possessions. \n \n What does \"all or virtually all\" mean? \n \n \"All or virtually all\" means that all significant parts and processing that go into the product must be of U.S. origin. That is, the product should contain no \u2014 or negligible \u2014 foreign content. \n \n What substantiation is required for a Made in USA claim? \n \n When a manufacturer or marketer makes an unqualified claim that a product is Made in USA, it should have \u2014 and rely on \u2014 a \"reasonable basis\" to support the claim at the time it is made. This means a manufacturer or marketer needs competent and reliable evidence to back up the claim that its product is \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S. \n \n What factors does the Commission consider to determine whether a product is \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S.? \n \n The product\u2019s final assembly or processing must take place in the U.S. The Commission then considers other factors, including how much of the product\u2019s total manufacturing costs can be assigned to U.S. parts and processing, and how far removed any foreign content is from the finished product. In some instances, only a small portion of the total manufacturing costs are attributable to foreign processing, but that processing represents a significant amount of the product\u2019s overall processing. The same could be true for some foreign parts. In these cases, the foreign content (processing or parts) is more than negligible, and, as a result, unqualified claims are inappropriate. \n \n Example: A company produces propane barbecue grills at a plant in Nevada. The product\u2019s major components include the gas valve, burner and aluminum housing, each of which is made in the U.S. The grill\u2019s knobs and tubing are imported from Mexico. An unqualified Made in USA claim is not likely to be deceptive because the knobs and tubing make up a negligible portion of the product\u2019s total manufacturing costs and are insignificant parts of the final product. Example: A table lamp is assembled in the U.S. from American-made brass, an American-made Tiffany-style lampshade, and an imported base. The base accounts for a small percent of the total cost of making the lamp. An unqualified Made in USA claim is deceptive for two reasons: The base is not far enough removed in the manufacturing process from the finished product to be of little consequence and it is a significant part of the final product. \n \n What items should manufacturers and marketers include in analyzing the percentage of domestic content in a particular product? \n \n Manufacturers and marketers should use the cost of goods sold or inventory costs of finished goods in their analysis. Such costs generally are limited to the total cost of all manufacturing materials, direct manufacturing labor, and manufacturing overhead. \n \n Should manufacturers and marketers rely on information from American suppliers about the amount of domestic content in the parts, components, and other elements they buy and use for their final products? \n \n If given in good faith, manufacturers and marketers can rely on information from suppliers about the domestic content in the parts, components, and other elements they produce. Rather than assume that the input is 100 percent U.S.-made, however, manufacturers and marketers would be wise to ask the supplier for specific information about the percentage of U.S. content before they make a U.S. origin claim. \n \n Example: A company manufactures food processors in its U.S. plant, making most of the parts, including the housing and blade, from U.S. materials. The motor, which constitutes 50 percent of the food processor\u2019s total manufacturing costs, is bought from a U.S. supplier. The food processor manufacturer knows that the motor is assembled in a U.S. factory. Even though most of the parts of the food processor are of U.S. origin, the final assembly is in the U.S., and the motor is assembled in the U.S., the food processor is not considered \"all or virtually all\" American-made if the motor itself is made of imported parts that constitute a significant percentage of the appliance\u2019s total manufacturing cost. Before claiming the product is Made in USA, this manufacturer should look to its motor supplier for more specific information about the motor\u2019s origin. Example: On its purchase order, a company states: \"Our company requires that suppliers certify the percentage of U.S. content in products supplied to us. If you are unable or unwilling to make such certification, we will not purchase from you.\" Appearing under this statement is the sentence, \"We certify that our ___ have at least ___% U.S. content,\" with space for the supplier to fill in the name of the product and its percentage of U.S. content. The company generally could rely on a certification like this to determine the appropriate country-of-origin designation for its product. \n \n How far back in the manufacturing process should manufacturers and marketers look? \n \n To determine the percentage of U.S. content, manufacturers and marketers should look back far enough in the manufacturing process to be reasonably sure that any significant foreign content has been included in their assessment of foreign costs. Foreign content incorporated early in the manufacturing process often will be less significant to consumers than content that is a direct part of the finished product or the parts or components produced by the immediate supplier. \n \n Example: The steel used to make a single component of a complex product (for example, the steel used in the case of a computer\u2019s floppy drive) is an early input into the computer\u2019s manufacture, and is likely to constitute a very small portion of the final product\u2019s total cost. On the other hand, the steel in a product like a pipe or a wrench is a direct and significant input. Whether the steel in a pipe or wrench is imported would be a significant factor in evaluating whether the finished product is \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S. \n \n Are raw materials included in the evaluation of whether a product is \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S.? \n \n It depends on how much of the product\u2019s cost the raw materials make up and how far removed from the finished product they are. \n \n Example: If the gold in a gold ring is imported, an unqualified Made in USA claim for the ring is deceptive. That\u2019s because of the significant value the gold is likely to represent relative to the finished product, and because the gold \u2014 an integral component \u2014 is only one step back from the finished article. By contrast, consider the plastic in the plastic case of a clock radio otherwise made in the U.S. of U.S.-made components. If the plastic case was made from imported petroleum, a Made in USA claim is likely to be appropriate because the petroleum is far enough removed from the finished product, and is an insignificant part of it as well. \n \n Qualified Claims \n \n What is a qualified Made in USA claim? \n \n A qualified Made in USA claim describes the extent, amount or type of a product\u2019s domestic content or processing; it indicates that the product isn\u2019t entirely of domestic origin. \n \n Example: \"60% U.S. content.\" \"Made in USA of U.S. and imported parts.\" \"Couch assembled in USA from Italian Leather and Mexican Frame.\" \n \n When is a qualified Made in USA claim appropriate? \n \n A qualified Made in USA claim is appropriate for products that include U.S. content or processing but don\u2019t meet the criteria for making an unqualified Made in USA claim. Because even qualified claims may imply more domestic content than exists, manufacturers or marketers must exercise care when making these claims. That is, avoid qualified claims unless the product has a significant amount of U.S. content or U.S. processing. A qualified Made in USA claim, like an unqualified claim, must be truthful and substantiated. \n \n Example: An exercise treadmill is assembled in the U.S. The assembly represents significant work and constitutes a \"substantial transformation\" (a term used by the U.S. Customs Service). All of the treadmill\u2019s major parts, including the motor, frame, and electronic display, are imported. A few of its incidental parts, such as the handle bar covers, the plastic on/off power key, and the treadmill mat, are manufactured in the U.S. Together, these parts account for approximately three percent of the total cost of all the parts. Because the value of the U.S.-made parts is negligible compared to the value of all the parts, a claim on the treadmill that it is \"Made in USA of U.S. and Imported Parts\" is deceptive. A claim like \"Made in U.S. from Imported Parts\" or \"Assembled in U.S.A.\" would not be deceptive. \n \n U.S. origin claims for specific processes or parts \n \n Claims that a particular manufacturing or other process was performed in the U.S. or that a particular part was manufactured in the U.S. must be truthful, substantiated, and clearly refer to the specific process or part, not to the general manufacture of the product, to avoid implying more U.S. content than exists. \n \n Manufacturers and marketers should be cautious about using general terms, such as \"produced,\" \"created\" or \"manufactured\" in the U.S. Words like these are unlikely to convey a message limited to a particular process. Additional qualification probably is necessary to describe a product that is not \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S. \n \n In addition, if a product is of foreign origin (that is, it has been substantially transformed abroad), manufacturers and marketers also should make sure they satisfy Customs\u2019 markings statute and regulations that require such products to be marked with a foreign country of origin. Further, Customs requires the foreign country of origin to be preceded by \"Made in,\" \"Product of,\" or words of similar meaning when any city or location that is not the country of origin appears on the product. \n \n Example: A company designs a product in New York City and sends the blueprint to a factory in Finland for manufacturing. It labels the product \"Designed in USA \u2014 Made in Finland.\" Such a specific processing claim would not lead a reasonable consumer to believe that the whole product was made in the U.S. The Customs Service requires the product to be marked \"Made in,\" or \"Product of\" Finland since the product is of Finnish origin and the claim refers to the U.S. Examples of other specific processing claims are: \"Bound in U.S. \u2014 Printed in Turkey.\" \"Hand carved in U.S. \u2014 Wood from Philippines.\" \"Software written in U.S. \u2014 Disk made in India.\" \"Painted and fired in USA. Blanks made in (foreign country of origin).\" Example: A company advertises its product, which was invented in Seattle and manufactured in Bangladesh, as \"Created in USA.\" This claim is deceptive because consumers are likely to interpret the term \"Created\" as Made in USA \u2014 an unqualified U.S. origin claim. Example: A computer imported from Korea is packaged in the U.S. in an American-made corrugated paperboard box containing only domestic materials and domestically produced expanded rigid polystyrene plastic packing. Stating Made in USA on the package would deceive consumers about the origin of the product inside. But the company could legitimately make a qualified claim, such as \"Computer Made in Korea \u2014 Packaging Made in USA.\" Example: The Acme Camera Company assembles its cameras in the U.S. The camera lenses are manufactured in the U.S., but most of the remaining parts are imported. A magazine ad for the camera is headlined \"Beware of Imported Imitations\" and states \"Other high-end camera makers use imported parts made with cheap foreign labor. But at Acme Camera, we want only the highest quality parts for our cameras and we believe in employing American workers. That\u2019s why we make all of our lenses right here in the U.S.\" This ad is likely to convey that more than a specific product part (the lens) is of U.S. origin. The marketer should be prepared to substantiate the broader U.S. origin claim conveyed to consumers viewing the ad. \n \n Comparative Claims \n \n Comparative claims should be truthful and substantiated, and presented in a way that makes the basis for comparison clear (for example, whether the comparison is to another leading brand or to a previous version of the same product). They should truthfully describe the U.S. content of the product and be based on a meaningful difference in U.S. content between the compared products. \n \n Example: An ad for cellular phones states \"We use more U.S. content than any other cellular phone manufacturer.\" The manufacturer assembles the phones in the U.S. from American and imported components and can substantiate that the difference between the U.S. content of its phones and that of the other manufacturers\u2019 phones is significant. This comparative claim is not deceptive. Example: A product is advertised as having \"twice as much U.S. content as before.\" The U.S. content in the product has been increased from 2 percent in the previous version to 4 percent in the current version. This comparative claim is deceptive because the difference between the U.S. content in the current and previous version of the product are insignificant. \n \n Assembled in USA Claims \n \n A product that includes foreign components may be called \"Assembled in USA\" without qualification when its principal assembly takes place in the U.S. and the assembly is substantial. For the \"assembly\" claim to be valid, the product\u2019s last \"substantial transformation\" also should have occurred in the U.S. That\u2019s why a \"screwdriver\" assembly in the U.S. of foreign components into a final product at the end of the manufacturing process doesn\u2019t usually qualify for the \"Assembled in USA\" claim. \n \n Example: A lawn mower, composed of all domestic parts except for the cable sheathing, flywheel, wheel rims and air filter (15 to 20 percent foreign content) is assembled in the U.S. An \"Assembled in USA\" claim is appropriate. Example: All the major components of a computer, including the motherboard and hard drive, are imported. The computer\u2019s components then are put together in a simple \"screwdriver\" operation in the U.S., are not substantially transformed under the Customs Standard, and must be marked with a foreign country of origin. An \"Assembled in U.S.\" claim without further qualification is deceptive. \n \n The FTC and The Customs Service \n \n What is the U.S. Customs Service\u2019s jurisdiction over country-of-origin claims? \n \n The Tariff Act gives Customs and the Secretary of the Treasury the power to administer the requirement that imported goods be marked with a foreign country of origin (for example, \"Made in Japan\"). \n \n When an imported product incorporates materials and/or processing from more than one country, Customs considers the country of origin to be the last country in which a \"substantial transformation\" took place. Customs defines \"substantial transformation\" as a manufacturing process that results in a new and different product with a new name, character, and use that is different from that which existed before the change. Customs makes country-of-origin determinations using the \"substantial transformation\" test on a case-by-case basis. In some instances, Customs uses a \"tariff shift\" analysis, comparable to \"substantial transformation,\" to determine a product\u2019s country of origin. \n \n What is the interaction between the FTC and Customs regarding country-of-origin claims? \n \n Even if Customs determines that an imported product does not need a foreign country-of-origin mark, it is not necessarily permissible to promote that product as Made in USA. The FTC considers additional factors to decide whether a product can be advertised or labeled as Made in USA. \n \n Manufacturers and marketers should check with Customs to see if they need to mark their products with the foreign country of origin. If they don\u2019t, they should look at the FTC\u2019s standard to check if they can properly make a Made in USA claim. \n \n The FTC has jurisdiction over foreign origin claims on products and in packaging that are beyond the disclosures required by Customs (for example, claims that supplement a required foreign origin marking to indicate where additional processing or finishing of a product occurred). \n \n The FTC also has jurisdiction over foreign origin claims in advertising and other promotional materials. Unqualified U.S. origin claims in ads or other promotional materials for products that Customs requires a foreign country-of-origin mark may mislead or confuse consumers about the product\u2019s origin. To avoid misleading consumers, marketers should clearly disclose the foreign manufacture of a product. \n \n Example: A television set assembled in Korea using an American-made picture tube is shipped to the U.S. The Customs Service requires the television set to be marked \"Made in Korea\" because that\u2019s where the television set was last \"substantially transformed.\" The company\u2019s World Wide Web page states \"Although our televisions are made abroad, they always contain U.S.-made picture tubes.\" This statement is not deceptive. However, making the statement \"All our picture tubes are made in the USA\" \u2014 without disclosing the foreign origin of the television\u2019s manufacture \u2014 might imply a broader claim (for example, that the television set is largely made in the U.S.) than could be substantiated. That is, if the statement and the entire ad imply that any foreign content or processing is negligible, the advertiser must substantiate that claim or net impression. The advertiser in this scenario would not be able to substantiate the implied Made in USA claim because the product was \"substantially transformed\" in Korea. \n \n Other Statutes \n \n What are the requirements of other federal statutes relating to country-of-origin determinations? \n \n Textile Fiber Products Identification Act and Wool Products Labeling Act \u2014 Require a Made in USA label on most clothing and other textile or wool household products if the final product is manufactured in the U.S. of fabric that is manufactured in the U.S., regardless of where materials earlier in the manufacturing process (for example, the yarn and fiber) came from. Textile products that are imported must be labeled as required by the Customs Service. A textile or wool product partially manufactured in the U.S. and partially manufactured in another country must be labeled to show both foreign and domestic processing. \n \n On a garment with a neck, the country of origin must be disclosed on the front of a label attached to the inside center of the neck \u2014 either midway between the shoulder seams or very near another label attached to the inside center of the neck. On a garment without a neck, and on other kinds of textile products, the country of origin must appear on a conspicuous and readily accessible label on the inside or outside of the product. \n \n Catalogs and other mail order promotional materials for textile and wool products, including those disseminated on the Internet, must disclose whether a product is made in the U.S., imported or both. \n \n The Fur Products Labeling Act requires the country of origin of imported furs to be disclosed on all labels and in all advertising. For copies of the Textile, Wool or Fur Rules and Regulations, or the new business education guide on labeling requirements, call the FTC\u2019s Consumer Response Center \n \n (202-382-4357). Or visit the FTC online at www.ftc.gov. Click on Consumer Protection. \n \n American Automobile Labeling Act \u2014 Requires that each automobile manufactured on or after October 1, 1994, for sale in the U.S. bear a label disclosing where the car was assembled, the percentage of equipment that originated in the U.S. and Canada, and the country of origin of the engine and transmission. Any representation that a car marketer makes that is required by the AALA is exempt from the Commission\u2019s policy. When a company makes claims in advertising or promotional materials that go beyond the AALA requirements, it will be held to the Commission\u2019s standard. For more information, call the Consumer Programs Division of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (202-366-0846). \n \n Buy American Act \u2014 Requires that a product be manufactured in the U.S. of more than 50 percent U.S. parts to be considered Made in USA for government procurement purposes.

Other products were stamped with the patriotic logo while the product specifications listed the item as imported. \n \n Walmart had an excuse, but the labels are magically gone \n \n While there is no official certification process for labeling a product \u201cmade in the USA,\u201d a company can still be sued for false advertising if they misuse the label. However, rather than taking legal action, Truth in Advertising simply sent a letter to Walmart CEO, Doug McMillon, causing the retail chain some embarrassment, but sparing them the court room drama. \n \n Walmart responded by saying that some manufacturing of its store brands had recently moved to the United States, but the website hadn\u2019t been update yet. However, many Made in USA labels were removed from the website after Truth in Advertising\u2019s letter went public. As for other brands, Walmart claims that the country of origin information comes from the supplier. \n \n Great reminder to stay honest \n \n Unimpressed by these excuses, executive direction of Truth in Advertising, Bonnie Patten, says that the \u201clargest retailer in the world should have made sure its American-made claims were accurate before affixing made in USA labels on the products. Until Walmart cleans up this mess, consumers cannot rely on Walmart with regard to where a product is really made when shopping on the site.\u201d \n \n The report also argues that the website\u2019s labels for \u201cMade in USA\u201d and \u201cAssembled in USA,\u201d with their tiny fonts and identical color schemes, are too similar to distinguish on the website, even though the Federal Trade Commission makes a clear differentiation between these two labels. \n \n All of this is an important reminder for businesses to stay honest in advertising. All it takes is a watchdog with an internet connection and keen eye to uncover false claims. ||||| While there is no official review process required for labeling a product as \u201cMade in the U.S.A.,\u201d a company can get into legal trouble for misusing that label, as doing so may constitute false advertising. A new report from an advertising watchdog group claims that Walmart\u2019s website has more than 100 examples of products incorrectly marketed as made in America. \n \n According to a letter [PDF] recently sent by the group Truth In Advertising to Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, \u201cWalmart\u2019s website is mired in USA labeling errors.\u201d \n \n Among the items singled out in the letter are Walmart\u2019s Equate store-brand makeup sponges in the image at the top of this story. TINA says these were given the Made in the U.S.A. label on Walmart.com even though the product\u2019s own packaging clearly states that they were \u201cMade in China.\u201d \n \n Another Equate-brand product called out by TINA are these teeth-whitening strips that the company simultaneously lists as made in America while declaring in the product details that they are imported form outside the country: \n \n \n \n In response to the TINA letter, Walmart told the group that manufacturing for both of these products was recently moved to the U.S. but that some stores may still contain versions made overseas and not all the information on the website is correct. Regardless, both items no longer carry the patriotic marketing message. \n \n It wasn\u2019t just store-brand items that got the false \u201cMade in U.S.A.\u201d labels, according to the report. TINA\u2019s letter gives the example of an Almay eyeliner that states the product is made and assembled here in the U.S., even though the packaging declares that it is \u201cMade in Germany.\u201d Walmart says that the country of origin information comes from the supplier. \n \n \u201cFalse made in USA labeling on Walmart\u2019s website has misled consumers looking to purchase American-made products,\u2019\u2019 said TINA.org Executive Director Bonnie Patten. \u201cThe largest retailer in the world should have made sure its American-made claims were accurate before affixing made in USA labels on the products. Until Walmart cleans up this mess, consumers cannot rely on Walmart with regard to where a product is really made when shopping on the site.\u201d \n \n ============ \n \n UPDATE: When reached for comment, a rep for Walmart provided the following statement to Consumerist \u2014 \n \n \u201cWe are continually working to improve our website listings and information. We are undertaking a more extensive quality assurance review to help eliminate these coding errors. Based on our initial internal review, we believe these errors are limited to a small percentage of items and we are confident in the overall integrity of the information on our website.\u201d \n \n ============ \n \n A more detailed report [PDF] commissioned by TINA looked at the actual \u201cMade in the U.S.A.\u201d labeling on Walmart.com and found a number of issues. \n \n This report noted that Walmart does little to differentiate its \u201cMade in the U.S.A.\u201d label from its \u201cAssembled in the U.S.A.\u201d label, even though the two labels have very different standards in the eyes of the Federal Trade Commission. \n \n \u201cThe legibility of the text at the top of the label, which can be either \u2018Made in the\u2019 or \u2018Assembled in the\u2019, is marginal even for people with excellent or corrected vision, due both to the text\u2019s small size and the low contrast of light blue text on a white background,\u201d writes the report\u2019s author, Dr. Jeff Johnson, who notes that the problem is exacerbated for farsighted people or those looking at the site on a small-format screen. \u201cIf such people have not seen it earlier in larger format (e.g., on a product page), they would be unable to determine what it says. Even consumers who have seen that text already in larger format would, in search results, have trouble distinguishing \u2018Made in the USA\u2019 from \u2018Assembled in the USA\u2019.\u201d",

I will be contacting the FBI and the Justice Department,\u201d Scaramucci wrote, inexplicably tagging White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. Scaramucci did not specify what information was leaked, but a Politico article cited the incoming communications director\u2019s required financial disclosure in reporting he earned $4.9 million since last year from his ownership stake in investment firm SkyBridge. Scaramucci appeared to delete the tweet, but in a subsequent post said Priebus was among the senior White House officials helping to crack down on leaks. ||||| The incoming White House communications director earned $4.9 million from his ownership stake in SkyBridge. | Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Scaramucci still stands to profit from SkyBridge from the White House The newly named White House communications director has earned millions from ownership stake since last year, according to his financial disclosure. \n \n Anthony Scaramucci finally has his White House job, but he still stands to profit from an ownership stake in his investment firm SkyBridge Capital. \n \n The incoming White House communications director earned $4.9 million from his ownership stake in SkyBridge in addition to more than $5 million in salary between Jan. 1, 2016, and the end of June, when he joined the Export-Import Bank, according to a financial disclosure filed with the Office of Government Ethics. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n The disclosure form, which is publicly available upon request, hasn\u2019t been previously reported. \n \n The disclosure highlights the extensive wealth Scaramucci has accumulated in his career \u2014 much like many of Trump\u2019s other top advisers and Cabinet secretaries \u2014 and also the challenge he faces in extracting himself from the potential conflicts his investments could pose. \n \n Scaramucci\u2019s financial filing values SkyBridge Capital at more than $50 million and states that he owns nearly 44 percent of the firm. When the sale of the company is completed, expected to be in the third quarter of this year, he will receive \u201cthe agreed-upon purchase price for his share of the sale proceeds,\u201d according to the filing. \n \n Bloomberg valued the Skybridge deal at between $200 million and $230 million when it was announced in January. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s black and white that he\u2019s going to get money,\u201d said Austin Evers, executive director at American Oversight, a watchdog group that focuses on transparency in government. \n \n The SkyBridge website continues to advertise Scaramucci as the firm's managing director, despite the fact that he has been a government employee for more than a month. A SkyBridge spokeswoman said Scaramucci stepped down from the executive post Jan. 17, when the company\u2019s sale was announced. He remained an employee of the firm, collecting a salary, until starting at Ex-Im last month. \n \n The investment firm, which Scaramucci founded in 2005, is in the process of being sold to RON Transatlantic and Chinese conglomerate HNA Group. The sale, set in motion in January when Scaramucci was shedding his holdings in anticipation of landing an administration job, has drawn the scrutiny of regulators and is taking longer than expected to close. \n \n The interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States is examining the deal to ensure that it carries no risk to national security. The panel\u2019s review, which comes amid ramped-up scrutiny of business dealings with China, ultimately can be overruled by President Donald Trump. \n \n Scaramucci said Friday his start date wouldn\u2019t be until August so that everything can be \u201c100 percent totally cleansed and clean and I don\u2019t see an issue with it.\u201d \n \n White House spokeswoman Natalie Strom referred questions about Scaramucci\u2019s SkyBridge investment to the Treasury. Treasury spokeswoman Marisol Garibay did not respond to requests for comment. \n \n Scaramucci, a Trump fundraiser and frequent campaign surrogate whose appointment to an administration post was delayed in part because of the complicated nature of the SkyBridge sale, joined Ex-Im in June. \n \n Ex-Im was seen as a \"very temporary move,\" a way to get the Trump loyalist to Washington until a higher-level position could be found, according to one White House adviser. \n \n The bank is across the street from the White House, where Scaramucci was free to come and go thanks to security credentials that gave him 24-hour access. That allowed him to elude the detection of senior White House staffers, including chief of staff Reince Priebus. \n \n Scaramucci has been on unpaid leave from Ex-Im since the day he started there, June 19, a bank spokeswoman said, forgoing his $172,100 salary as chief strategy officer. \n \n A friend said Scaramucci thought his stay at the bank would be longer-lived and that the White House job came unexpectedly. \n \n In his disclosure, Scaramucci listed assets worth as much as $85 million. He has several real estate investments, including single-family rental homes on Long Island. \n \n A minority stake in the New York Mets is worth as much as $5 million. He also is an investor in Juice Press, a chain of snack and smoothie shops in the Northeast. \n \n Scaramucci earned $200,000 in income from a majority stake in Hastings Capital Group, according to his financial disclosure. That ownership share also will be sold as part of the SkyBridge deal with RON and HNA. \n \n As a contributor to Fox News, Scaramucci earned about $88,000, according to his financial disclosure. \n \n He has three mortgages with U.S. Bank for a total liability of $2.5 million to $7 million. \n \n Josh Dawsey contributed to this report. ||||| Tweet with a location \n \n You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

An extensive analysis of recent data showed that one in every seven colorectal cancer patients was younger than 50. The University of Michigan study raises questions about the current guidelines to begin screening at age 50. \n \n Signs of colorectal cancer, often called the \u201csymptomless cancer,\u201d include anemia, a dramatic change in the size or frequency of bowel movements, and dark blood or blood mixed with stool, (sometimes appearing as black threads), in bowel movements. Because these symptoms may be nonexistent, mild, or infrequent, many people are not aware of their condition until their malignancy becomes advanced and spreads into the lymph nodes. A colonoscopy is the usual screening test, but stool tests are also effective for some people. If you are worried, you can request your primary care physician provide you with one of these simple stool tests, no matter your age. \n \n Younger Patients Increasing \n \n Seeing a recent rise in cancer cases among younger people, a team led by Dr. Samantha Hendren conducted a study of the nationally representative Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Insitute to assess age and treatment patterns among colorectal patients. Specifically, they gathered and analyzed data from patients diagnosed in the United States between 1998 and 2011. Their results point to important changes. \n \n Of more than 258,000 total colorectal cancer patients, 37,847 (about 15 percent) were younger than 50. These younger-than-expected patients were more likely to be diagnosed with either regional or distant malignancies, both of which are more dangerous than localized tumors. \n \n In terms of treatment, younger patients suffering with a distant metastasis \u2014 where the cancer has spread from an original tumor \u2014 were more likely to undergo surgery than older patients; 72 percent versus 63 percent. Radiation therapy was more likely to be used with younger rectal cancer patients than in older patients; 53 percent versus 48 percent. \n \n By various measures, younger patients saw more positive results. Despite the tendency to have more advanced disease when diagnosed, younger-than-50 colorectal cancer patients overall lived slightly longer without a cancer recurrence. With regard to localized disease, the five-year survival rate was 95.1 percent for younger patients versus 91.9 percent for older patients, with regard to regional disease, 76 percent versus 70.3 percent, and with regard to distant disease 21.3 percent versus 14.1 percent. \n \n \u201cThese findings suggest the need for improved risk assessment and screening decisions for younger adults,\u201d wrote the researchers in the study. They believe their work is a wake-up call to the medical community, which should be looking for the signs of colorectal cancer in patients younger than 50. \n \n If age 50 is maintained as the recommended time to begin screening, this study suggests that nearly 15 percent of all patients may be caught late in the process of disease. By comparison, breast cancer screening is recommended to begin at age 40. Less than 5 percent of invasive breast cancers occur in women under that age. \n \n Source: Abdelsattar Z, Wong S, Regenbogen S, et al. Colorectal Cancer Outcomes and Treatment Patterns in Patients Too Young for Average-Risk Screening. CANCER. 2016. ||||| (Reuters Health) - One in seven colon and rectal cancers in the U.S. are now diagnosed in patients younger than age 50, which is when people are advised to begin routine screenings for these tumors, a new study finds. \n \n By 2030, nearly one in four rectal tumors and more than one in 10 colon cancers will be diagnosed in people under 50, researchers estimate in the journal Cancer. \n \n \u201cColorectal cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly; this study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colorectal cancers are occurring in young people,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Samantha Hendren of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. \n \n Researchers analyzed cancer registry data from 1998 to 2011 for about 258,000 patients with colorectal tumors and found that 37,847 of them, or almost 15 percent, were diagnosed before age 50. \n \n Compared with older patients, those under 50 were 30 percent more likely to be diagnosed with tumors that had spread to the lymph nodes and 50 percent more likely to have cancer that had advanced to other organs, the study found. \n \n Younger patients with tumors that had metastasized, or reached other organs, were also more likely than older people to get more aggressive treatments. \n \n About 72 percent of people under 50 got surgery, compared with 63 percent of older individuals. And while 53 percent of younger patients received radiation, just 48 percent of older people did. \n \n Even though patients diagnosed younger tended to have more aggressive disease, they also lived slightly longer without tumors returning after their initial course of treatment. \n \n Five-year survival odds were about 95 percent for patients under 50 diagnosed with local tumors that hadn\u2019t spread yet, compared to roughly 92 percent for older people. \n \n With tumors that spread to the lymph nodes, five-year survival rates were 76 percent for young people and 70 percent for older patients, while with cancers that metastasized to other organs the survival odds were 21 percent versus 14 percent, respectively. \n \n One shortcoming of the study is that researchers lacked data on family history and other risk factors for colorectal cancers, the authors note. It\u2019s also possible that treatment choices and overall survival were influenced by what\u2019s known as selection bias, when healthier people may get more interventions and have better outcomes. \n \n Often, patients may get an early warning of colorectal tumors with symptoms such as bleeding, changes in bowel habits or pain when going to the bathroom that can point to the need for diagnostic screening, said Dr. Joel Randolph Hecht, director of the gastrointestinal oncology program at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles. \n \n \u201cUnfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\u201d Hecht, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email. \n \n There are guidelines for screening some people starting at age 40 if they have a family history of colorectal cancer, noted Dr. Sidney Winawer of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. \n \n \u201cWithout a family history, physicians need to use their judgment when seeing young people who have bowel symptoms and refer those of concern to a gastroenterologist for a diagnostic workup, \u201c Winawer, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, added by email. \u201cThis is difficult since we do not wish to expose young people to unnecessary tests.\u201d \n \n It isn\u2019t clear from the study findings, however, whether changing preventive screening guidelines to start at a younger age would ultimately prevent more cancer deaths, said Dr. David Weinberg, chairman of medicine at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. \n \n \u201cIf the goal of screening is disease prevention, as it generally is for colorectal cancer, it is not clear when screening should start,\u201d Weinberg, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email. \u201cToo early and the yield of screening will be very low since young people are still less likely to get colorectal cancer than older people.\u201d \n \n SOURCE: bit.ly/23o5QvC Cancer, online January 25, 2016. ||||| MONDAY, Jan. 25, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Colon cancer rates are rising among men and women under 50, the age at which guidelines recommend screenings start, a new analysis shows. One in seven colon cancer patients is under 50. Younger patients are more likely to have advanced stage cancer, but they live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence because they are treated aggressively, the researchers reported. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" said study lead author Dr. Samantha Hendren, an associate professor of surgery at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. \n \n \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50,\" she added. \n \n However, Hendren said it's too soon to say whether colon cancer screening guidelines should be altered to reflect that trend. \n \n In the analysis, colon cancer among younger patients was often found at an advanced stage, meaning the disease has spread to lymph nodes or other organs. \"Part of the reason for this is that these young patients are often diagnosed only after their cancers start to cause symptoms, such as anemia, bowel bleeding or a blockage in the colon,\" Hendren explained. \n \n Doctors should be on the lookout for these warning signs of colon cancer, she added. \n \n Not all bowel bleeding is caused by cancer, she said. \"Bright red bleeding with a bowel movement is usually due to hemorrhoids or fissures, but dark blood or blood mixed with the stool is a warning sign,\" Hendren said. \n \n People with a family history of colon cancer and others who are at higher risk should begin screening earlier than the age of 50, she said. \"This is already recommended, but we don't think this is happening consistently, and this is something we need to optimize,\" she added. \n \n The report was published online Jan. 25 in the journal Cancer. \n \n Dr. Andrew Chan, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said the reasons for the increase in colon cancer among younger adults isn't known. \n \n \"It is unexplained,\" he said. \"It's not simply a change in diagnoses, it's a very real increase. There may be an effect of our environment that could be contributing to the increase.\" \n \n Smoking, obesity and physical inactivity are all risk factors for colon cancer, as is a poor diet, Chan said. \"When we are faced with patients who have many of these elements, we should think more about the potential of them developing colon cancer at an earlier age,\" he said. \n \n For the study, Hendren and her colleagues culled federal government data on nearly 260,000 patients diagnosed with colon cancer between 1998 and 2011. \n \n Of these patients, nearly 15 percent were younger than 50. These patients were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced cancer and more likely to have surgery than older patients (72 percent versus 63 percent). Radiation therapy was also used more often in younger patients than in older patients (53 percent versus 48 percent), the researchers found. \n \n Younger patients lived a little longer without a cancer recurrence, even though they tended to have more advanced cancer, Hendren said. \n \n For patients under 50, about 68 percent survived five years, while about 67 percent of the patients 50 and older survived five years, she said. \"It looks like patients' young age helps them in their cancer treatment and survival,\" she added. \n \n These findings raise the question of whether screening for colon cancer should begin at an earlier age, Hendren said. \"This would be a big and costly change, and I don't know whether it would help more people than it would hurt, so a lot of research would be required to understand this before any changes should be made,\" she said. \n \n Chan noted that although the incidence of colon cancer is increasing among people under 50, the risk is still low. \"I don't think the data at this point support expanding screening to younger age groups,\" he said. \n \n Hendren said that \"the cancer community needs to prepare for the increasing number of very young colorectal cancer survivors who will need long-term support to cope with the physical and psychological consequences of their disease and treatments.\" \n \n More information \n \n Visit the U.S. National Cancer Institute for more on colon cancer.",

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

    "document": "TOKYO Exhausted engineers attached a power cable to the outside of Japan's tsunami-crippled nuclear plant on Saturday in a race to prevent deadly radiation from an accident now rated at least as bad as America's Three Mile Island incident in 1979. \n \n Further cabling inside was under way before an attempt to restart water pumps needed to cool overheated nuclear fuel rods at the six-reactor Fukushima plant in northeastern Japan, 240 km (150 miles) north of Tokyo. \n \n Japan's unprecedented multiple crisis of earthquake, tsunami and radiation leak has unsettled world financial markets, prompted international reassessment of nuclear safety and given the Asian nation its sternest test since World War Two. \n \n It has also stirred unhappy memories of Japan's past nuclear nightmare -- the U.S. atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. \n \n Working inside a 20 km (12 miles) evacuation zone at Fukushima, nearly 300 engineers were focused on trying to find a solution by restoring power to pumps in four of the reactors. \n \n \"TEPCO has connected the external transmission line with the receiving point of the plant and confirmed that electricity can be supplied,\" the plant's operator Tokyo Electric Power Co said in a statement. \n \n Another 1,480 meters (5,000 feet) of cable are being laid inside the complex before engineers try to crank up the coolers at reactor No.2, followed by numbers 1, 3 and 4 this weekend, company officials said. \n \n If that works it will be a turning point. \n \n \"If they are successful in getting the cooling infrastructure up and running, that will be a significant step forward in establishing stability,\" said Eric Moore, a nuclear power expert at U.S.-based FocalPoint Consulting Group. \n \n If not, there is an option of last resort under consideration to bury the sprawling 40-year-old plant in sand and concrete to prevent a catastrophic radiation release. \n \n That method was used to seal huge leakages from the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. \n \n Underlining authorities' desperation, fire trucks sprayed water overnight in a crude tactic to cool reactor No.3, considered the most critical because of its use of mixed oxides, or mox, containing both uranium and highly toxic plutonium. \n \n Japan has raised the severity rating of the nuclear crisis to level 5 from 4 on the seven-level INES international scale, putting it on a par with the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, although some experts say it is more serious. \n \n Chernobyl, in Ukraine, was a 7 on that scale. \n \n THOUSANDS DEAD, MISSING AND SUFFERING \n \n The operation to avert large-scale radiation has overshadowed the humanitarian aftermath of the 9.0-magnitude quake and 10-meter (33-foot) tsunami that struck on March 11. \n \n Nearly 7,000 people have been confirmed killed in the double natural disaster, which turned whole towns into waterlogged and debris-shrouded wastelands. \n \n Another 10,700 people are missing with many feared dead. \n \n Some 390,000 people, including many among Japan's aging population, are homeless and battling near-freezing temperatures in shelters in northeastern coastal areas. \n \n Food, water, medicine and heating fuel are in short supply. \n \n \"Everything is gone, including money,\" said Tsukasa Sato, a 74-year-old barber with a heart condition, as he warmed his hands in front of a stove at a shelter for the homeless. \n \n Health officials and the U.N. atomic watchdog have said radiation levels in the capital Tokyo were not harmful. But the city has seen an exodus of tourists, expatriates and many Japanese, who fear a blast of radioactive material. \n \n \"I'm leaving because my parents are terrified. I personally think this will turn out to be the biggest paper tiger the world has ever seen,\" said Luke Ridley, 23, from London as he sat at Narita international airport using his laptop. \n \n \"I'll probably come back in about a month.\" \n \n Though there has been alarm around the world, experts have been warning there is little risk of radiation at dangerous levels spreading to other nations. \n \n The U.S. government said \"minuscule\" amounts of radiation were detected in California consistent with a release from Japan's damaged facility, but there were no levels of concern. \n \n Amid their distress, Japanese were proud of the 279 nuclear plant workers toiling in the wreckage, wearing masks, goggles and protective suits sealed by duct tape. \n \n \"My eyes well with tears at the thought of the work they are doing,\" Kazuya Aoki, a safety official at Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, told Reuters. \n \n G7 INTERVENTION FOR YEN \n \n The Group of Seven rich nations succeeded in calming global financial markets in rare concerted intervention to restrain a soaring yen. \n \n The dollar surged to 81.98 yen on Friday after the G7 moved to pour billions into markets buying dollars, euros and pounds -- the first such joint intervention since the group came to the aid of the newly launched euro in 2000. \n \n The dollar later dropped back to under 81 yen, but it was still far from the record low of 76.25 yen hit on Thursday. \n \n \"The only type of intervention that actually works is coordinated intervention, and it shows the solidarity of all central banks in terms of the severity of the situation in Japan,\" said Kathy Lien, director of currency research at GFT in New York. \n \n Japan's Nikkei share index ended up 2.7 percent, recouping some of the week's stinging losses. It lost 10.2 percent for the week, wiping $350 billion off market capitalization. \n \n The plight of the homeless worsened following a cold snap that brought heavy snow to the worst-affected areas. \n \n Nearly 290,000 households in the north were still without electricity, officials said, and the government said about 940,000 households lacked running water. \n \n Aid groups say most victims are getting help, but there are pockets of acute suffering. \n \n \"We've seen children suffering with the cold, and lacking really basic items like food and clean water,\" Stephen McDonald of Save the Children said in a statement on Friday. \n \n (Additional reporting by Linda Sieg, Nathan Layne, Elaine Lies, Leika Kihara, Jon Herskovitz, Joseph Radford and Chris Gallagher in Japan; Fiona Ortiz in Madrid; Scott DiSavino in New York; Writing by Andrew Cawthorne; Editing by Robert Birsel) ||||| YAMAGATA, Japan -- Emergency workers seemed to try everything they could think of Thursday to douse one of Japan's dangerously overheated nuclear reactors: helicopters, heavy-duty fire trucks, even water cannons normally used to quell rioters. But they couldn't be sure any of it was easing the peril at the tsunami-ravaged facility. \n \n (SCROLL DOWN FOR LIVE UPDATES) \n \n Three reactors have had at least partial meltdowns, but an even greater danger has emerged. Japanese and U.S. concerns were increasingly focusing on the pools used to store spent nuclear fuel: Some of the pools are dry or nearly empty and the rods could heat up and spew radiation. \n \n It could take days and \"possibly weeks\" to get the complex under control, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman Gregory Jazcko said. He defended the U.S. decision to recommend a 50-mile evacuation zone for its citizens, a much stronger measure than Japan has taken. \n \n A senior official with the U.N.'s nuclear safety agency said there had been \"no significant worsening\" at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant but that the situation remained \"very serious.\" Graham Andrew told reporters in Vienna that nuclear fuel rods in two reactors were only about half covered with water, and in a third they were also not completely submerged. \n \n If the fuel is not fully covered, rising temperatures and pressure will increase the chances of complete meltdowns that would release much larger amounts of radioactive material than the failing plant has emitted so far. \n \n Low levels of radiation have been detected well beyond Tokyo, which is 140 miles (220 kilometers) south of the plant, but hazardous levels have been limited to the plant itself. Still, the crisis triggered by last week's earthquake and tsunami has forced thousands to evacuate and drained Tokyo's normally vibrant streets of life, its residents either leaving town or holing up in their homes. \n \n President Barack Obama appeared on television to assure Americans that officials do not expect harmful amounts of radiation to reach the U.S. or its territories. He also said the U.S. was offering Japan any help it could provide, and said he was asking for a comprehensive review of U.S. nuclear plant safety. \n \n Japanese and American assessments of the crisis have differed, with the plant's owner denying Jazcko's report Wednesday that Unit 4's spent fuel pool was dry and that anyone who gets close to the plant could face potentially lethal doses of radiation. But a Tokyo Electric Power Co. executive moved closer to the U.S. position Thursday. \n \n \"Considering the amount of radiation released in the area, the fuel rods are more likely to be exposed than to be covered,\" Yuichi Sato said. \n \n Workers have been dumping seawater when possible to control temperatures at the plant since the quake and tsunami knocked out power to its cooling systems, but they tried even more desperate measures on Unit 3's reactor and cooling pool. \n \n Two Japanese military CH-47 Chinook helicopters began dumping seawater on Unit 3 on Thursday morning, defense ministry spokeswoman Kazumi Toyama said. The choppers doused the reactor with at least four loads of water in just the first 10 minutes, though television footage showed much of it appearing to disperse in the wind. \n \n Chopper crews flew missions of about 40 minutes each to limit their radiation exposure, passing over the reactor with loads of about 2,000 gallons (7,500 liters) of water. Another 9,000 gallons (35,000 liters) of water were blasted from military trucks with high-pressure sprayers used to extinguish fires at plane crashes, though the vehicles had to stay safely back from areas deemed to have too much radiation. \n \n Special police units with water cannons were also tried, but they could not reach the targets from safe distances and had to pull back, said Yasuhiro Hashimoto, a spokesman for Japan's nuclear safety agency. \n \n Unit 3's reactor uses a fuel that combines plutonium, better known as an ingredient in nuclear weapons, and reprocessed uranium. The presence of this mixed oxide fuel, or MOX, means potentially that two very harmful radioactive products could be released into the environment. \n \n Tokyo Electric Power said it believed workers were making headway in staving off a catastrophe both with the spraying and, especially, with efforts to complete an emergency power line to restart the plant's own electric cooling systems. \n \n \"This is a first step toward recovery,\" said Teruaki Kobayashi, a facilities management official at the power company. He said radiation levels \"have somewhat stabilized at their lows\" and that some of the spraying had reached its target, with one reactor emitting steam. \n \n \"We are doing all we can as we pray for the situation to improve,\" Kobayashi said. Authorities planned to spray again Friday, and Kobayashi said: \"Choices are limited. We just have to stick to what we can do most quickly and efficiently.\" \n \n Work on connecting the new power line to the plant was expected to begin Friday and take 10 to 15 hours, said Nuclear Safety Agency spokesman Minoru Ohgoda. But the utility is not sure the cooling systems will still function. If they don't, electricity won't help. \n \n Four of the plant's six reactors have seen fires, explosions, damage to the structures housing reactor cores, partial meltdowns or rising temperatures. Officials also recently said temperatures are rising even in the spent fuel pools of the other two reactors. \n \n The troubles at the nuclear complex were set in motion by last Friday's 9.0-magnitude earthquake and tsunami, which knocked out power and destroyed backup generators needed for the reactors' cooling systems. That added a nuclear crisis on top of twin natural disasters that likely killed well more than 10,000 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless. \n \n Mario V. Bonaca, a physicist sits on an advisory committee to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said he believes the focus of the effort has shifted to the spent fuel pools. \"I understand that they've controlled the cooling of the cores,\" said Bonaca, who said he was basing his understanding on NRC and industry sources. \n \n The storage pools need a constant source of cooling water. Even when removed from reactors, uranium rods are still extremely hot and must be cooled for months, possibly longer, to prevent them from heating up again and emitting radioactivity. \n \n While a core team of 180 emergency workers has been rotating in and out of the complex to avoid exposure, experts said that anyone working close to the reactors was almost certainly being exposed to radiation levels that could, at least, give them much higher cancer risks. \n \n Experts note, though, that radiation levels drop quickly with distance from the complex. While elevated radiation has been detected well outside the evacuation zone, experts say those levels are not dangerous. \n \n U.S. officials were taking no chances. In Washington, the State Department warned U.S. citizens to consider leaving the country and offered voluntary evacuation to family members and dependents of U.S. personnel in the cities of Tokyo, Yokohama and Nagoya. \n \n The first flight left Thursday, with fewer than 100 people onboard, Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy said. Plans also call for airlifting several thousand family members of U.S. armed forces personnel as well as nonessential staff stationed in Japan in the coming days. \n \n The U.S. evacuation zone is far bigger than that established by Japan, which has called for a 12-mile zone and has told those within 20 miles to stay indoors. Daniel B. Poneman, U.S. deputy secretary of energy, said at the briefing that his agency agreed with the 50-mile zone - but said Japan's measures were also prudent. \n \n Nearly a week after the earthquake and tsunami, police said more than 452,000 people were staying in schools and other shelters, as supplies of fuel, medicine and other necessities ran short. Both victims and aid workers appealed for more help, as the chances of finding more survivors dwindled. \n \n Noriko Sawaki lives in a battered neighborhood in Sendai that is still without running water and food or gasoline supplies and that, she said, makes life exhausting. \"It's frustrating, because we don't have a goal, something to strive for. This just keeps on going,\" said the 48-year-old. \n \n In the town of Kesennuma, people lined up to get into a supermarket after a delivery of key supplies, such as instant rice packets and diapers. \n \n Each person was only allowed to buy 10 items, NHK television reported. \n \n With diapers hard to find in many areas, an NHK program broadcast a how-to session on fashioning a diaper from a plastic shopping bag and a towel. ||||| Smoke billowed from a building at Japan's crippled nuclear power plant Friday as emergency crews worked to reconnect electricity to cooling systems and spray more water on overheating nuclear fuel at the tsunami-ravaged facility. \n \n ALTERNATE CROP OF TOK870 OF MARCH 17, 2011 - In this photo taken on Wednesday afternoon, March 16, 2011 and released on Thursday, March 17 by Tokyo Electric Power Co.

Without enough water, the rods may heat further and spew out radiation. \n \n \"We see it as an extremely serious accident,\" Yukiya Amano, the head of the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency, told reporters Friday just after arriving in Tokyo. \"This is not something that just Japan should deal with, and people of the entire world should cooperate with Japan and the people in the disaster areas.\" \n \n Frantic efforts were made Thursday to douse a number of units with water, and authorities were preparing to repeat many of those efforts. \n \n Friday's smoke came from the complex's Unit 2, and its cause was not known, the nuclear safety agency said. An explosion had hit the building on Tuesday, possibly damaging a crucial cooling chamber that sits below the reactor core. \n \n Last week's 9.0 quake and tsunami in Japan's northeast set off the nuclear problems by knocking out power to cooling systems at the reactors. The unfolding crises have led to power shortages in Japan, forced auto and other factories to close, sending shockwaves through global manufacturing and trade, and triggered a plunge in Japanese stock prices. \n \n Low levels of radiation have been detected well beyond Tokyo, which is 140 miles (220 kilometers) south of the plant, but hazardous levels have been limited to the plant itself. Still, the crisis has forced thousands to evacuate and drained Tokyo's normally vibrant streets of life, its residents either leaving town or holing up in their homes. \n \n The Japanese government has been slow in releasing information on the crisis, even as the troubles have multiplied. In a country where the nuclear industry has a long history of hiding its safety problems, this has left many people _ in Japan and among governments overseas _ confused and anxious. \n \n \"I feel a sense of dread,\" said Yukiko Morioka, 63, who has seen business dry up at her lottery ticket booth in Tokyo. \"I'm not an expert, so it's difficult to understand what's going on. That makes it scarier.\" \n \n A senior official with the U.N. nuclear agency said Thursday there had been \"no significant worsening\" at the nuclear plant but that the situation remained \"very serious.\" Graham Andrew told reporters in Vienna that nuclear fuel rods in two reactors were only about half covered with water, and they were also not completely submerged in a third. \n \n Edano said Friday that Tokyo is asking the U.S. government for help and that the two are discussing the specifics. \n \n \"We are coordinating with the U.S. government as to what the U.S. can provide and what people really need,\" Edano said. \n \n At times, the two close allies have offered starkly differing assessments over the dangers at Fukushima. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman Gregory Jazcko said Thursday that it could take days and \"possibly weeks\" to get the complex under control. He defended the U.S. decision to recommend a 50-mile (80-kilometer) evacuation zone for its citizens, wider than the 30-mile (50-kilometer) band Japan has ordered. \n \n Crucial to the effort to regain control over the Fukushima plant is laying a new power line to the plant, allowing operators to restore cooling systems. The operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co., missed a deadline late Thursday but said Friday that workers hoped to complete the effort in 10 to 15 hours, said nuclear safety agency spokesman Minoru Ohgoda. \n \n But the utility is not sure the cooling systems will still function. If they don't, electricity won't help. \n \n The official death toll from the disasters stood at 6,405 as of Friday morning, with 10,259 missing, the national police agency said. \n \n President Barack Obama appeared on television to assure Americans that officials do not expect harmful amounts of radiation to reach the U.S. or its territories. He also said the U.S. was offering Japan any help it could provide. \n \n A utility official said Wednesday that the company has been unable to get information such as water levels and temperatures from any of the spent fuel pools in the four most troubled reactors. \n \n Workers have been dumping seawater when possible to control temperatures at the plant since the quake and tsunami knocked out power to its cooling systems, but they tried even more desperate measures on Units 3 and 4. \n \n On Thursday, military helicopters dumped thousands of gallons of water from huge buckets onto Unit 3, and also used military firefighting trucks normally used to extinguish fires at plane crashes. \n \n Officials announced Friday they would not continue with the helicopter drops _ televised footage appeared to show much of that water blowing away _ but would continue spraying from the trucks. \n \n Police said more than 452,000 people made homeless by the quake and tsunami were staying in schools and other shelters, as supplies of fuel, medicine and other necessities ran short. Both victims and aid workers appealed for more help, as the chances of finding more survivors dwindled. \n \n At the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant, a core team of 180 emergency workers has been rotating out of the complex to minimize radiation exposure. \n \n The storage pools need a constant source of cooling water. Even when removed from reactors, uranium rods are still extremely hot and must be cooled for months, possibly longer, to prevent them from heating up again and emitting radioactivity. \n \n In Washington, the State Department warned U.S. citizens to consider leaving the country and offered voluntary evacuation to family members and dependents of U.S. personnel in the cities of Tokyo, Yokohama and Nagoya. \n \n ___ \n \n Yamaguchi reported from Tokyo. Associated Press writers George Jahn in Vienna, Elaine Kurtenbach, Shino Yuasa, Jeff Donn and Tim Sullivan in Tokyo contributed to this report. ||||| While the findings were reassuring in the short term, the United States declined to back away from its warning to Americans there to stay at least 50 miles from the plant, setting up a far larger perimeter than the Japanese government had established. American officials did not release specific radiation readings. \n \n American officials said their biggest worry was that a frenetic series of efforts by the Japanese military to get water into four of the plant\u2019s six reactors \u2014 including using water cannons and firefighting helicopters that dropped water but appeared to largely miss their targets \u2014 showed few signs of working. \n \n \u201cThis is something that will likely take some time to work through, possibly weeks, as eventually you remove the majority of the heat from the reactors and then the spent fuel pool,\u201d said Gregory Jaczko, the chairman of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission , briefing reporters at the White House. \n \n The effort by the Japanese to hook some electric power back up to the plant did not begin until Thursday and even if they succeed, it is unclear whether the cooling systems, in reactor buildings battered by a tsunami and then torn apart by hydrogen explosions, survived the crisis in good enough shape to be useful. \n \n \u201cWhat you are seeing are desperate efforts \u2014 just throwing everything at it in hopes something will work,\u201d said one American official with long nuclear experience who would not speak for attribution. \u201cRight now this is more prayer than plan.\u201d \n \n On Thursday, President Obama said that the crisis had convinced him to order the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to do a comprehensive review of the safety of nuclear plants in the United States. \n \n After a day in which American and Japanese officials gave radically different assessments of the danger from the nuclear plant, the two governments tried on Thursday to join forces. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Experts met in Tokyo to compare notes. The United States, with Japanese permission, began to put the intelligence-collection aircraft over the site, in hopes of gaining a view for Washington as well as its allies in Tokyo that did not rely on the announcements of officials from the Tokyo Electric Power Company, which operates Fukushima Daiichi. \n \n American officials say they suspect that the company has consistently underestimated the risk and moved too slowly to contain the damage. \n \n Aircraft normally used to monitor North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons activities \u2014 a Global Hawk drone and U-2 spy planes \u2014 were flying missions over the reactor, trying to help the Japanese government map out its response to last week\u2019s 9.0-magnitude earthquake, the tsunami that followed and now the nuclear disaster. \n \n President Obama made an unscheduled stop at the Japanese Embassy to sign a condolence book, writing, \u201cMy heart goes out to the people of Japan during this enormous tragedy.\u201d He added, \u201cBecause of the strength and wisdom of its people, we know that Japan will recover, and indeed will emerge stronger than ever.\u201d \n \n Later, he appeared in the Rose Garden at the White House to offer continued American support for the earthquake and tsunami victims, and technical help at the nuclear site. \n \n Video \n \n But before the recovery can begin, the nuclear plant must be brought under control. On Friday, steam that was likely laced with radioactive particles was again rising over the plant, this time billowing from reactor No. 2, which suffered an explosion Tuesday. But Japanese authorities said they did not yet know the cause of the latest release. \n \n American officials, meanwhile, remained fixated on the temperature readings inside that reactor and two others that had been operating until the earthquake shut them down, as well as at the plant\u2019s spent fuel pools, looking for any signs that their high levels of heat were going down. If the fuel rods are uncovered and exposed to air, they heat up and can burst into flames, spewing radioactive elements. \n \n So far the officials saw no signs of dropping temperatures. And the Web site of the International Atomic Energy Agency , the United Nations nuclear watchdog, made it clear that there were no readings at all from some critical areas. Part of the American effort, by satellites and aircraft, is to identify the hot spots, something the Japanese have not been able to do in some cases. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Made for quick assessments of radiation emergencies, the Aerial Measuring System is an instrument system that fits on a helicopter or fixed-wing aircraft to sample air and survey the land below. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Daniel B. Poneman, the deputy secretary of energy, said at a White House briefing on Thursday that preliminary results of the initial flights \u201care consistent with the recommendations that came down from the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,\u201d which led to the 50-mile evacuation guideline given to American expatriates. Although the worst contamination is closer to the plant, the recommendation takes into account the possibility of shifting winds or greater emissions. \n \n The State Department has also said it would fly out of the country any dependents of American diplomats or military personnel within the region of the plant and as far south as Tokyo. Space will be made for other Americans who cannot get a flight, it said. \n \n Getting the Japanese to accept the American detection equipment was a delicate diplomatic maneuver, which some Japanese officials originally resisted. But as it became clear that conditions at the plant were spinning out of control, and with Japanese officials admitting they had little hard evidence about whether there was water in the cooling pools or breaches in the reactor containment structures, they began to accept more help. \n \n The sensors on the instrument pod are good at mapping radioactive isotopes, like cesium 137, which has been detected around the nuclear plant and has a half-life of 30 years. In high doses, it can cause acute radiation sickness . Lower doses can alter cellular function, leading to an increased risk of cancer . \n \n Cesium 137 can enter the body through many foods, including milk. \n \n On Wednesday, when the American Embassy in Tokyo, on advice from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, told Americans to evacuate a radius of \u201capproximately 50 miles\u201d around the Fukushima plant, the recommendation was based on a specific calculation of risk of radioactive fallout in the affected area. \n \n In a statement, the commission said the advice grew out of its assessment that projected radiation doses within the evacuation zone might exceed one rem to the body or five rems to the thyroid gland. That organ is extremely sensitive to iodine 131 \u2014 another of the deadly byproducts of nuclear fuel, this one causing thyroid cancer . \n \n The commission says that the average American is exposed to about 0.62 rem of radiation each year from natural and manmade sources. \n \n The American-provided instruments in Japan measure real levels of radiation on the ground. In contrast, scientists around the world have also begun to draw up forecasts of how the prevailing winds pick up the Japanese radioactive material and carry it over the Pacific in invisible plumes. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Private analysts said the United States was also probably monitoring the reactor crisis with spy satellites that can spot the heat from fires \u2014 helping it independently assess the state of the reactor complex from a distance. \n \n Jeffrey G. Lewis, an intelligence specialist at the Monterey Institute, a research center, noted that the Japanese assessment of Reactor No. 4 at the Daiichi complex seemed to depend in part on visual surveillance by helicopter pilots. \n \n \u201cI\u2019ve got to think that, if we put our best assets into answering that question, we can do better,\u201d he said in an interview. \n \n One main concern at No. 4 has been a fire that was burning there earlier in the week; American officials are not convinced that the fire has gone out. \n \n American officials have also worried that the spent-fuel pool at that reactor has run dry, exposing the rods. Japanese officials, however, have concentrated much of their recent efforts on Reactor No. 3, which has been intermittently releasing radiation from what the authorities believe may be a ruptured containment vessel around the reactor. Temperatures at that reactor\u2019s spent fuel pool are also high. \n \n Perhaps because of the difficulties experienced Thursday trying to accurately drop water from helicopters, the Japanese military announced Friday that it was halting those efforts for at least a day.",

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Japanese officials are considering burying the country's damaged nuclear reactors under sand and concrete in a last-ditch effort to avoid a catastrophic meltdown. Experts say burying the plants would be the only way to prevent a meltdown as bad as Three Mile Island's in 1979, Reuters reports. The situation at the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant is worse than Chernobyl, and the death toll from Japan's earthquake and tsunami now stands at more than 7,000, with more than 10,700 people still missing. In other developments: Workers have finally connected a power cable to the outside of the plant, allowing for electricity to be supplied to four reactors, Reuters reports. Officials are also working to restart water pumps needed to cool overheated nuclear fuel rods. Fire trucks sprayed water overnight in a desperate attempt to cool reactor No.3, considered the most critical because of its use of mixed oxides, or mox, containing both uranium and highly toxic plutonium. Japan has raised the severity rating of the nuclear crisis to level 5 from 4 on the seven-level INES international scale, putting it on a par with the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, although some experts say it is more serious. Health officials and the UN atomic watchdog have said radiation levels in the capital Tokyo were not harmful. The city has seen an exodus of tourists, expatriates, and many Japanese, who fear a blast of radioactive material. \"I'm leaving because my parents are terrified. I personally think this will turn out to be the biggest paper tiger the world has ever seen,\" said a British tourist.",

    "document": "The idea of a \"sober January\" has been around for as long as man has cursed his in-laws at Christmas. And while a month off the booze sounds like a seductive way to make up for all that hard-drinking festive excess, it\u2019s actually a terrible idea, rooted in guilt rather than science. And for some people who actually have a real problem with alcohol, successfully completing a \"sober January\" can give the dangerous illusion that they don\u2019t have a problem. \n \n I should know. I was one of them. I speak not only as a veteran of many a sober January, but also as someone who was finally forced to admit that yes, they were an alcoholic, and had to stop drinking entirely. I have not had a drink for several years now. I don\u2019t say this to boast, merely to put in context what follows. \n \n I remember one hungover December morning telling a colleague at the magazine where I was working at the time that I was planning to stay off the drink for a month in the new year. \n \n \u201cWhy on earth would you do that?\u201d he replied. \u201cA few drinks are the only thing that get you through January, it\u2019s so bloody miserable.\u201d \n \n He wasn\u2019t an addict, so he didn\u2019t understand the allure of a sober January to someone who was \u2013 that the idea of getting obliterated over Christmas and New Year and then \"white-knuckling\" it for a month before picking up where you left off is deeply appealing to the classic all-or-nothing, getting-away-with-it mentality of the addict. \n \n I managed several sober Januarys and they became an important weapon in my armoury of denial. Me, an alcoholic? Hardly! How could I manage to stay off drink for a month if I was? \n \n I find it particularly depressing that this year, the idea of a dry January is being promoted by the UK\u2019s biggest alcohol charity, the always well-intentioned Alcohol Concern. Although the charity is careful to state in small print at the bottom of its webpage that the challenge should \"not be attempted by people with an alcohol dependency problem\" unfortunately those are exactly the kind of people a promotion like this will attract. Year after year, the only mates that I could persuade to do a sober January with me were the ones who were as bad as or worse than me. The normals, like my co-worker, were never interested. Why would they be? \n \n If you are worried about the amount you have been drinking, the answer is not to swear off drink for a month. The answer is to try and establish whether you do really have a problem. And the best way to do that, ironically enough, is to do some drinking. \n \n This was the course of action recommended by Bill Wilson, the co-founder of the self-help movement Alcoholics Anonymous. Wilson believed that alcoholics suffer a kind of allergic reaction to alcohol, and that once they start drinking they develop an overwhelming craving for more. This craving, he thought, is only made worse by subsequent attempts to satisfy it with more drink, like an itch that gets worse the more you scratch it. \n \n Wilson\u2019s alcoholism test is remarkably simple, and does not involve any boxes to tick or medical examinations or liver function tests; it just requires a modicum of honesty. \n \n \u201cWe do not like to pronounce any individual as alcoholic, but you can quickly diagnose yourself,\u201d he wrote. \u201cStep over to the nearest barroom and try some controlled drinking. Try to drink and stop abruptly. Try more than once. It will not take long for you to decide, if you are honest with yourself about it.\u201d \n \n So - unless your sole aim is to save cash - don't challenge yourself to a sober January.

As a recovering alcoholic, Sykes should know. \"I managed several sober Januaries, and they became an important weapon in my armory of denial,\" he writes. A real alcoholic, after all, couldn't make it, he reasoned. But the truth is the ritual appeals deeply \"to the classic all-or-nothing, getting-away-with-it mentality of the addict,\" while \"normals\" have no use for it. He advises instead trying to have just one drink a night\u2014if stopping after one is difficult, you'll know you have a problem. But if you actually are a \"normal,\" it turns out there might be some merit in the month-long detox. The staff at the New Scientist ran a small-scale test on themselves, and got some pretty astonishing results. Ten staffers laid off booze for five weeks, and saw their liver fat, blood glucose, and blood cholesterol levels all fall significantly\u2014reducing their risk for liver disease, diabetes, and heart disease\u2014while four staffers who kept drinking saw no changes. But it was a fairly limited experiment, offering no clue how long those effects will last. Heather Timmons at Quartz argues that such \"detoxes\" are \"useless\" in the long-term, since the body regularly clears out toxins all on its own. So instead, she recommends taking two or three consecutive days off from drinking each week, since it takes the liver a full day to recover from heavy drinking\u2014plus, over the course of a year, that ensures as many as 150 alcohol-free days.",

    "document": "This undated image made available by the Oregon Health & Science University in May 2013 shows a stem cell colony developed from cloned human embryos. Scientists have finally recovered stem cells from... (Associated Press) \n \n Scientists have finally recovered stem cells from cloned human embryos, a longstanding goal that could lead to new treatments for such illnesses as Parkinson's disease and diabetes. \n \n A prominent expert called the work a landmark, but noted that a different, simpler technique now under development may prove more useful. \n \n Stem cells can turn into any cell of the body, so scientists are interested in using them to create tissue for treating disease. Transplanting brain tissue might treat Parkinson's disorder, for example, and pancreatic tissue might be used for diabetes. \n \n But transplants run the risk of rejection, so more than a decade ago, researchers proposed a way around that: Create tissue from stem cells that bear the patient's own DNA, obtained with a process called therapeutic cloning. \n \n If DNA from a patient is put into a human egg, which is then grown into an early embryo, the stem cells from that embryo would provide a virtual genetic match. So in theory, tissues created from them would not be rejected by the patient. \n \n That idea was met with some ethical objections because harvesting the stem cells involved destroying human embryos. \n \n Scientists have tried to get stem cells from cloned human embryos for about a decade, but they've failed. Generally, that's because the embryos stopped developing before producing the cells. In 2004, a South Korean scientist claimed to have gotten stem cells from cloned human embryos, but that turned out to be a fraud. \n \n In Wednesday's edition of the journal Cell, however, scientists in Oregon report harvesting stem cells from six embryos created from donated eggs. Two embryos had been given DNA from skin cells of a child with a genetic disorder, and the others had DNA from fetal skin cells. \n \n Shoukhrat Mitalipov of the Oregon Health & Science University, who led the research, said the success came not from a single technical innovation, but from revising a series of steps in the process. He noted it had taken six years to reach the goal after doing it with monkey embryos. \n \n Mitalipov also said that based on monkey work, he believes human embryos made with the technique could not develop into cloned babies, and he has no interest in trying to do that. Scientists have cloned more than a dozen kinds of mammals, starting with Dolly the sheep. \n \n The new work was financed by the university and the Leducq Foundation in Paris. \n \n Dr. George Daley, a stem cell expert at Children's Hospital Boston who didn't participate in the work, called the new results \"one landmark step in a very long journey\" toward creating DNA-matched transplant tissue. \n \n Now, Daley said, scientists must compare the embryo-cloning approach with another technology that reprograms blood or skin cells directly into substitutes for embryonic stem cells. This reprogramming approach is technically simpler and doesn't involve embryos or require the donation of human eggs, and it was widely acclaimed when it was reported in 2007. Its Japanese developer shared a Nobel Prize last year. \n \n But these substitute cells show some molecular differences compared to embryonic ones, which has led to questions about whether they can safely be used for treating patients. So it's essential to compare the cells from the two methods, Daley said. \n \n The new results mean \"we have another tool,\" he said. \"We have to learn more about this tool.\" \n \n Daley said he believed scientists will prefer using the reprogramming approach unless it can be proven \"beyond a shadow of a doubt\" that embryo cloning produces better cells for treating patients. \n \n Mitalipov said he believed his technique would present a particular advantage for treating patients with a certain type of rare diseases. These are caused by mutations in genes of the mitochondria, the power plants of cells. He noted his technique, unlike the cell-reprogramming approach, would supply tissue with new mitochondrial genes that could replace defective ones. Those new genes would come from the egg. \n \n The Rev. Tad Pacholczyk, director of education for National Catholic Bioethics Center, an independent think tank in Philadelphia, reiterated his opposition to embryo cloning, calling the approach unethical. \n \n \"It involves the decision to utilize early human beings as repositories for obtaining desired cells,\" he said. \"You're creating them only to destroy them.\" \n \n Marcy Darnovsky, executive director of the Center for Genetics and Society in Berkeley, California, said she was glad that Mitalipov doubted the embryos could be used to clone babies. She said the report still provides a good opportunity for the federal government to ban the use of cloning for reproduction. ||||| OHSU Photos \n \n It was hailed some 15 years ago as the great hope for a biomedical revolution: the use of cloning techniques to create perfectly matched tissues that would someday cure ailments ranging from diabetes to Parkinson\u2019s disease. Since then, the approach has been enveloped in ethical debate, tainted by fraud and, in recent years, overshadowed by a competing technology. Most groups gave up long ago on the finicky core method \u2014 production of patient-specific embryonic stem cells (ESCs) from cloning. A quieter debate followed: do we still need \u2018therapeutic\u2019 cloning? \n \n A paper published this week1 by Shoukhrat Mitalipov, a reproductive biology specialist at the Oregon Health and Science University in Beaverton, and his colleagues is sure to rekindle that debate. Mitalipov and his team have finally created patient-specific ESCs through cloning, and they are keen to prove that the technology is worth pursuing. \n \n Therapeutic cloning, or somatic-cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), begins with the same process used to create Dolly, the famous cloned sheep, in 1996. A donor cell from a body tissue such as skin is fused with an unfertilized egg from which the nucleus has been removed. The egg \u2018reprograms\u2019 the DNA in the donor cell to an embryonic state and divides until it has reached the early, blastocyst stage. The cells are then harvested and cultured to create a stable cell line that is genetically matched to the donor and that can become almost any cell type in the human body. \n \n Many scientists have tried to create human SCNT cell lines; none had succeeded until now. Most infamously, Woo Suk Hwang of Seoul National University in South Korea used hundreds of human eggs to report two successes, in 2004 and 2005. Both turned out to be fabricated. Other researchers made some headway. Mitalipov created SCNT lines in monkeys2 in 2007. And Dieter Egli, a regenerative medicine specialist at the New York Stem Cell Foundation, successfully produced human SCNT lines3, but only when the egg\u2019s nucleus was left in the cell. As a result, the cells had abnormal numbers of chromosomes, limiting their use. \n \n Monkeying around \n \n Mitalipov and his group began work on their new study last September, using eggs from young donors recruited through a university advertising campaign. In December, after some false starts, cells from four cloned embryos that Mitalipov had engineered began to grow. \u201cIt looks like colonies, it looks like colonies,\u201d he kept thinking. Masahito Tachibana, a fertility specialist from Sendai, Japan, who is finishing a 5-year stint in Mitalipov\u2019s laboratory, nervously sectioned the 1-millimetre-wide clumps of cells and transferred them to new culture plates, where they continued to grow \u2014 evidence of success. Mitalipov cancelled his holiday plans. \u201cI was happy to spend Christmas culturing cells,\u201d he says. \u201cMy family understood.\u201d \n \n The success came through minor technical tweaks. The researchers used inactivated Sendai virus (known to induce fusion of cells) to unite the egg and body cells, and an electric jolt to activate embryo development. When their first attempts produced six blastocysts but no stable cell lines, they added caffeine, which protects the egg from premature activation. \n \n None of these techniques is new, but the researchers tested them in various combinations in more than 1,000 monkey eggs before moving on to human cells. \u201cThey made the right improvements to the protocol,\u201d says Egli. \u201cIt\u2019s big news. It\u2019s convincing. I believe it.\u201d \n \n The experiments took only a few months, Mitalipov says. \u201cPeople say, you did it in monkeys in 2007. Why did it take six years in humans?\u201d Most of the time, he says, was spent navigating US regulations on embryo research. \n \n The researchers carried out a battery of tests to prove that their SCNT cells could form various cell types, including heart cells that are able to contract spontaneously. \n \n Their first cell lines were created using fetal skin cells; others were derived using donor cells from an 8-month-old patient with a rare metabolic disorder called Leigh syndrome, to prove that ESCs could be made from more mature donor cells. The technique does not require prohibitive numbers of eggs: it took 15 from one donor to produce one cell line and 5 from a different donor to make another. \u201cThe efficiency was the most impressive thing,\u201d says George Daley, a stem-cell expert at Children\u2019s Hospital Boston in Massachusetts. \n \n Such improvements might be necessary to convince people that SCNT research is still worthwhile. Egg donors for the experiment received US$3,000\u20137,000 in compensation. This is expensive and, according to some bioethicists, risks creating an organ trade that preys on the poor. Because the technique requires the destruction of embryos, funds from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) cannot be used to make or study SCNT-derived cell lines, hampering further clinical research. (Mitalipov maintains a separate laboratory for NIH-funded research.) \n \n Public fears that the technology might be used to create human clones are another sticking point. The research might spark \u201ccloning hysteria\u201d that opponents of stem-cell research could capitalize on, says Bernard Siegel, executive director of the Genetics Policy Institute in Palm Beach, Florida. But Mitalipov has tried without success for more than a decade to produce a monkey by cloning. Tachibana says that an upcoming publication will explain why reproductive cloning of humans is not possible using their SCNT technique. \n \n Still, Daley and most other stem-cell researchers have shifted to another method for creating genetically matched, patient-specific cell lines: reprogramming adult cells to an embryonic state to produce induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. First reported in 2006, the technique does not involve eggs, cloning or destruction of embryos4. \u201cHonestly, the most surprising thing [about this paper] is that somebody is still doing human [SCNT] in the era of iPS cells,\u201d says Miodrag Stojkovic, who studies iPS cells for regenerative medicine and runs a fertility clinic in Leskovac, Serbia. \n \n But Stojkovic, like others, awaits the results of head-to-head comparisons between iPS and SCNT cells. Some research has shown that iPS cells are not completely reprogrammed and that stem cells derived from SCNT are more like embryonic stem cells derived from in vitro fertilization. Mitalipov and Tachibana are now conducting a study to compare iPS cells and SCNT cells derived from the same donor cell. \u201cThese results,\u201d says Daley, \u201cwill be fascinating.\u201d",

Commonly cited examples are growing brain tissue to help a patient with Parkinson's disease, or pancreatic tissue to help diabetics. It's \"one landmark step in a very long journey,\" says an expert at Children's Hospital Boston who wasn't involved with the work. The Oregon scientists say they don't think the embryos used in their process could develop into babies, reports NBC News, but the procedure is nonetheless controversial because it requires that the embryos be destroyed. Nature notes that competing technology in the last decade has made the push toward embryonic stem cells less intensive, but adds that the new paper in Cell is sure to reignite the debate.

    "document": "The saga of the illegally obtained nude photos of dozens of celebrities has taken a darker turn. According to Reddit administrators, photos of gymnast McKayla Maroney and MTV actress Liz Lee, shared to 130,000 people on popular forum r/TheFappening, constitute child pornography. \n \n Maroney\u2019s lawyers have confirmed that the illegally obtained photos were taken while the gymnast was underage. The attorneys\u2019 letter, sent to Porn.com and other websites, demands that the images be removed. \n \n Additionally, Reddit users have been sharing revenge-porn photos of the actress Liz Lee, whose photos were not part of the initial leaks, but were taken and leaked by her boyfriend when Lee was 16. \n \n The ongoing leak\u2014dubbed #CelebGate, or more distastefully, \u201cthe Fappening\u201d\u2014includes naked photos of A-listers including Jennifer Lawrence and Kate Upton. It\u2019s prompted outrage, and threats of legal actions from the women targeted. It has since emerged that the photos of at least one of the celebrities were taken when they were under 18. \n \n The Reddit community r/TheFappening has become the main hub for the leaked photos, due to the fact that Reddit is one of the few mainstream websites that isn\u2019t proactively deleting all links to them. In an urgent post, the subreddit\u2019s moderators warn the community that the site\u2019s admins have informed them that Maroney was underage in the photos \u201cand that we quickly need to remove them. \n \n \u201cIf we don\u2019t remove them,\u201d moderator SickOrSane continues, \u201cthis subreddit will most likely be banned, very quickly.\u201d \n \n The moderator also warns against sharing Lee\u2019s photos, which are apparently also being posted on the subreddit. \n \n \n \n \n \n Redditors have immediately begun to panic, discussing the potential implications of their downloading and sharing child pornography. \n \n \n \n \n \n Despite the proliferation of child pornography across r/TheFappening\u2014in addition to the stolen intimate photos of adult celebrities\u2014the Reddit admins have chosen not to remove the community, apparently content to let the moderators sort it out instead. They have, however, hidden the forum from r/all, a list of all content on Reddit. \n \n \n \n \n \n The focus, throughout the subreddit, is the potential ramifications community members may face for possessing child porn. \n \n Here, redditors respond to Classiest_Erection with step-by-step instructions for how to use software to wipe his hard drive, which ostensibly contains illegally obtained underage nudes. We\u2019re watching a crime being aided and abetted in real time. \n \n In another instance, notwhoyouthinimnot goes out of his way to proactively encourage redditors to remove all record of their criminal activity. \n \n Other community members are only too eager to help. \n \n \n \n \n \n Some are more concerned with the fact that their community may be banned than the fact it\u2019s being used to share flagrantly illegal material. \n \n The moderators, meanwhile, are joking about the fact that child porn has been found on their community. (The linked photo in the screenshot below is not pornographic.) \n \n Reddit admins may yet change course and decide to ban r/TheFappening. Even though redditors are using the site to instruct one another how to hide evidence of the child porn they downloaded via Reddit, administrators seem happy to allow the community to exist. \n \n It still remains unclear how the photos were leaked, though Apple has strongly denied early reports that hackers gained access to them through a vulnerability in iCloud. \n \n Photo via teuobk/Flickr (CC BY 2.0) | Remix by Fernando Alfonso III ||||| The bizarre silver lining to this whole leaked celebrity nudes thing: a group of Redditors is so enamored with Jennifer Lawrence's naked body that they've donated thousands of dollars to the Prostate Cancer Foundation in her honor. \n \n Yesterday, a post on r/TheFappening, a Reddit thread dedicated to, erm, discussing and cataloging the dozens of naked celebrity pictures that hit the internet over the weekend, urged readers to \"Be the hero TheFappening deserves\" by donating money to prostate cancer research, which, the joke goes, Lawrence has supported in the past. (Get it? Masturbation may reduce risk of prostate cancer in men, and many of these men, upon viewing the photos\u2014you're smart, you get it.) \n \n Horndog J-Law fans came out in droves, and TheFappening is currently the top fundraiser for PCF's Safeway Foundation $1 Million Matching Grant Challenge. According to TheFappening's donation page, they've given $5,273 to the cause so far, and the homepage for the fundraiser lists \"Reddit The Fappening\" as its most successful donor. \n \n Well, congratulations to you, you proud masturbators of Reddit: TheFappening somehow feels even more skeevy for your noble actions. If the rumors are true, and the weekend's leaks were just the tip of the iceberg, they may find a cure just yet. \n \n [Image via AP] ||||| McKayla Maroney I Was Underage in Hacked Nude Pics \n \n McKayla Maroney -- I Was Underage in Hacked Nude Photos \n \n EXCLUSIVE \n \n Olympic gymnastsays she was under 18 when the hacked nude photos of her were taken ... and now she's taking legal action against several porn sites that reposted the images.TMZ has learned one of Maroney's attorneys fired off a letter to Porn.com ... informing the site that McKayla was underage in several of the photos. The letter demands the images of McKayla -- who turned 18 last December -- be taken down immediately.Another attorney for the gymnast sent a different letter to multiple websites stating Maroney owns the copyright on the hacked photos.The legal claims by her attorneys are a strong indication the photos really do show McKayla -- even though she said on Twitter they were \"fake photos.\" It's also possible only portions of the images are really McKayla. The letter is not specific.A rep for Porn.com tells us they immediately removed the pics once they got the letter from Maroney's attorney.",

Maroney had initially tweeted that the photos were fakes. At Reddit, users of a forum that has been used to share leaked pics have been warned that some pictures of Maroney and MTV star Liz Lee were taken when they were underage and if they're not deleted, \"this subreddit will most likely be banned, very quickly.\" The warning was followed by panicked discussion of how to erase the images, reports the Daily Dot, which describes efforts to advise users how to \"remove all record of their criminal activity\" as the \"aiding and abetting\" of a crime. The Prostate Cancer Foundation, meanwhile, has decided to return thousands of dollars donated by users of the same subreddit as \"guilt money\" for viewing the celeb photos, rather crudely \" in honor of Jennifer Lawrence \" (Gawker has the explanation here). \"Guys, we're literally worse than cancer,\" one user wrote after the donations were returned, as per the Washington Post.

Treasury has advised that tobacco clearances fell by 3.4% in the 2013 calendar year relative to the 2012 calendar year and fell a further 7.9% in the 2014 calendar year. As at the end of 2014, tobacco clearances had fallen a total of 11.0% since 2012.These tobacco clearance rates do not take into account refunds of excise equivalent customs duty made under Customs\u2019 plain packaging related Tobacco Refund Scheme between December 2012 and May 2013. These refunds cannot be related to annual net clearances on a comparable basis to other data used to derive tobacco clearance rates.The tobacco excise rate was indexed to average weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE) from 1 March 2014 and there have been three of four 12.5% increases in the tobacco excise rate (1 December 2013, 1 September 2014, 1 September 2015) implemented. The next 12.5% increase will occur on 1 September 2016.As part of Health initiatives announced in the 2016 Budget, the Australian Government is reducing the allowable amount of duty free tobacco for travellers arriving in Australia.From 1 July 2017, travellers aged 18 years and over can only bring 25 grams of duty free tobacco, plus one open packet, into Australia. The tobacco can be in any form (cigarette, loose leaf and so on) and is equivalent to approximately 25 cigarettes.If you have more than this amount, you will be required to pay duty on all tobacco in your possession, unless you agree to dispose of the excess.Please ensure you are familiar with duty free limits when travelling to Australia.For more information on duty free limits, as well as what you can and cannot bring to Australia visit the Duty free concession page on the Department of Immigration and Boarder Protection website.There are a number of sources the Government relies on to monitor smoking rates, including data from national surveys conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW), and drug and alcohol information collected nationally from secondary school students by the Cancer Council Victoria.On 28 April 2016, the ABS released the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Survey, 2014-15.The survey was conducted from September 2014 to June 2015 with a sample of 11,178 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living in private dwellings across Australia. The report shows that in 2014-15:On 8 December 2015, the ABS released the National Health Survey: First Results 2014-15.The survey was conducted in all states and territories and across urban, rural and remote areas of Australia (other than very remote areas) from July 2014 to June 2015, and included around 19,000 people in nearly 15,000 private dwellings.

In May, previously passed legislation will go into effect requiring all packs of cigarettes to be standardized. Tobaccos products will be stripped of brightly colored branding and replaced with a sludge-like color. \n \n But does the stripped-down, \"ugly\" packaging really reduce smoking? \n \n Researchers from the UK and Canada summarized several studies that look at the impact of tobacco packaging on consumer attitudes and behavior. Their findings were published today in a Cochrane Review \n \n Jamie Hartmann-Boyce of the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group, co-author of the review, noted that \"the evidence we have so far suggests that standardized packaging may reduce smoking prevalence and increase quit attempts.\" \n \n The UK law, passed last year, is similar to a cigarette standardization plan Australia enacted in 2012, which also features graphic health warnings and standardized fonts. \n \n The muddy color -- Pantone 448C -- was chosen after marketing research company GfK Bluemoon was commissioned to develop ideas for unappealing cigarette packing. The agency asked Australian smokers about colors they found unappealing and overwhelming. Pantone 448 C was later named \"the world's ugliest color.\" \n \n Respondents reportedly associated the color with the words \"dirty,\" \"tar\" and \"death.\" \n \n I used to feature so much in all your 70s couches, curtains and wallpapers. What did I do to deserve this? \u2014 Pantone 448 C (@Pantone448C) August 17, 2012 \n \n Deterring bathroom breaks \n \n Cigarette and tobacco packaging is not the first time the murky shade has been used in an attempt to turn people away from certain behaviors. According to Angela Wright, a color consultant and author of \"The Beginner's Guide to Colour Psychology,\" the technique has been around for decades. \n \n She cites American color consultant Faber Birren, who in the 1960s devised a way to stop department store employees from taking lengthy bathroom breaks. \n \n \"The company asked him, 'Can you improve the working area so they don't have to leave all the time and use the restrooms?' \" Wright said. \n \n \"Birren actually took a different view and painted the restrooms in a color similar to Pantone 448C. And nobody wanted to spend time in the restrooms after that.\" \n \n This is just one of the many examples that the \"world's ugliest color\" has been used to minimize appeal to control human behavior. \n \n Is Pantone 448C really that bad? \n \n What makes Pantone 448C so off-putting? Wright said she believes it's the association with human waste. \n \n \"It makes perfect sense that smoking packets would use a vile green that looks like bodily fluids and makes people feel slightly nauseated,\" she said. \n \n But not everyone agrees. \n \n France will also introduce plain cigarette packaging. \n \n \"I actually quite like the color,\" said psychologist Dr. Carolyn Mair of the London College of Fashion, UAL. \"It's an earthy, muted, rich color, very much of nature. But then I also don't smoke.\" \n \n Color in advertising \n \n The use of color can play a key role in brand perception among the public. \n \n \"Blue is often used in services such as banking and law because of its association with loyalty, honesty and reliability,\" Mair said. Red meanwhile \"raises the pulse rate ... and communicates strength and high energy,\" Wright said. \n \n Color associations Red: Strength, energy, passion Blue: Focus, loyalty, calmness Yellow: Ego, optimism, openness Green: Balance, youth, eco-friendly Purple: Luxury, femininity, glamour Sources: Angela Wright, Carolyn Mair \n \n \"Football teams who have red uniforms are giving themselves more physical energy but also communicating to the opposite team that they are powerful and strong.\" \n \n And purple has connotations with luxury, Mair said. \n \n \"Think of Cadbury chocolate (which has a purple logo). At least when it started out, it had the association with a glamorous, smooth, feminine brand,\" she added. \n \n Color combinations can also have powerful connotations. \n \n In the UK, the Esso petrol logo features red, white and blue -- much like many national flags, including those of the United States, Great Britain and France. \n \n \"So this combination can result in an instinctive loyalty,\" Wright said. \n \n The eye of the beholder \n \n That said, perception also plays a huge role -- as seen in Wright's and Mair's different responses to Pantone 448C. \n \n \"Red could be seen as aggressive and demanding -- or as exhilarating and exciting,\" Wright said. \"Similarly, blue could be perceived as calming and well-thought-through -- or excessively bureaucratic and emotionless.\" \n \n Wright sees the overwhelming color of our times as a bleak gray. \n \n \"Gray is the color of austerity,\" Wright said. \"And we're going to keep wearing gray until we feel better financially.\" \n \n That is, unless you feel compelled to lighten things with a splash of Pantone 448C. ||||| It\u2019s none of these.

Per the Guardian, GfK surveyed 1,000 smokers back then to find out which hue turned them off the most, and this Pantone pick\u2014a greenish-brown blend that survey participants said reminded them of \"death\" and \"tar\"\u2014emerged the winner. Time notes the agency had been commissioned by the Australian government to find a color so repellent it could be used on cigarette packaging to discourage people from lighting up. The new color was found to have the most ability to \"minimize appeal\" and \"maximize perceived harm\" and was implemented on plain cigarette packs with health warnings across Australia, the Brisbane Times reported at the time. Early results are now in, and it appears the color that CNN describes as \"sludge-like\" may have made an impact: Cigarette sales have fallen, and now other countries such as the UK, France, and Ireland are following suit, per Metro. So what is it about the color that makes it such an effective sales deterrent? A color consultant tells CNN it may be the strong resemblance to, well, poop. But not everyone's on board with trashing opaque couch\u00e9.

    "document": "CLOSE With the World Series tied at 1-1, USA TODAY Sports' Steve Gardner tells you how the Cubs got the victory in Game 2 over the Indians. USA TODAY Sports \n \n Cubs player Kyle Schwarber hits an RBI single against the Indians in the fifth inning of Game 2. (Photo: Charles LeClaire, USA TODAY Sports) \n \n CLEVELAND \u2014 It no longer defies imagination, but assaults the senses, wondering how sheer and utter fantasy could become reality. \n \n How in the world could a baseball player spend six months just learning to walk again after a devastating knee injury, not playing in a single game, and lead the Chicago Cubs to their first World Series victory since 1945, with a 5-1 victory over the Cleveland Indians, evening the Series at 1-game apiece? \n \n \"It\u2019s the 'Legend of Kyle Schwarber,' \" catcher David Ross said. \n \n And the way this narrative is playing out, Cubs third baseman Kris Bryant predicts, it will soon be coming to a movie theater near you. \n \n \"I can\u2019t even describe what he\u2019s doing right now,\" said left fielder Ben Zobrist, who\u2019s hitting .625 this series and is like a back-drop to center stage. \"No one\u2019s ever seen anything like it.\" \n \n There has never been a position player in baseball history whose first hit of the season was in the World Series until Schwarber came along. He doubled off Cleveland ace Corey Kluber in Game 1, and then went 2-for-4 with two RBI and a walk in Wednesday\u2019s victory. \n \n \"He better not take one single swing in the offseason,\" first baseman Anthony Rizzo said. \n \n Indeed, the dude is making a total mockery out of spring training, let alone rehab assignments. \n \n This is a guy who had no hits in four at-bats in April before he blew out his left knee. He had one hit in eight at-bats in the Arizona Fall League. Now, on baseball\u2019s greatest stage, he is hitting .429, reaching base five times in nine at-bats, with a double, two singles and two RBI. \n \n If he keeps this up, and Schwarber leads the Cubs to their first World Series title since 1908, there will be generations of Schwarbers who will never have to pay for a drink or adult beverage in their lifetimes in the city of Chicago. \n \n \"If we win three more,\" Rizzo said, \"he doesn\u2019t have to take another swing in his life. Take your time, and enjoy your life.\" \n \n Considering that Schwarber has all of four months of baseball experience on his bubble-gum card, and is baseball\u2019s ultimate gym rat, there\u2019s a better chance of him conducting hitting lessons when he\u2019s 80 than ever giving up this gig. \n \n \"He\u2019s just a dirt bag,\" Rizzo said. \"He\u2019s always around the field. He\u2019s always watching baseball. Always watching film. Sometimes, too much. \n \n \"When he was on the DL, he\u2019s there watching film, studying scouting reports, and I would yell at him, 'What are you doing? What are you doing?' \" \n \n Who realized all along that Schwarber was secretly plotting his comeback? \n \n \"Baseball\u2019s a crazy game,\" Schwarber said. \"It will do crazy things to you.\" \n \n So crazy, that he went along with the Cubs\u2019 narrative, that he would be out for the season. When you tear two knee ligaments, no one expects to see you until next season. If he had only sustained the injury earlier, maybe in spring training, he\u2019d have a chance, but not during the season. \n \n And even if he was physically able to return before the end of the season, there would be no time for a minor-league rehab assignment, no time to get down his timing, no time to see major-league pitching. \n \n \"That\u2019s why we\u2019re calling it 'The Legend of Kyle Schwarber,' \" Ross said. \"That\u2019s who does this. It just blows my mind what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s doing things that are unheard of.\" \n \n Yet, on baseball\u2019s biggest stage, in front of millions on national TV, Schwarber is turning the World Series into his own reality TV show. \n \n Watch Schwarber become the Cubs\u2019 first DH in World Series history. Watch Schwarber hit. Watch Schwarber run. Watch Schwarber drive in two runs. \n \n Oh, and if you need to tug at the heartstrings too, watch Schwarber become emotional talking about his 10-year-old friend, Campbell Faulkner of Queen Creek, Ariz. \n \n Faulkner, diagnosed with a rare form of mitochondrial disease, has a team of 13 doctors. He struggles to stand and walk for extended periods of time. He needs two feeding tubes in his stomach just to provide him with nutrition. He missed nearly 100 days of school last year because of his illness and doctor appointments. \n \n Schwarber met him in spring training and saw him last weekend before meeting the Cubs in the World Series. Faulkner is his friend, and Schwarber wears a bright green wristband in his honor to make those aware of the disease. \n \n \"Really young, smart kid, and he\u2019s just always got a big smile on his face,\" Schwarber said. \"You know, that draws your attention to him. He\u2019s living life to his fullest, even though he\u2019s got something to overcome. \n \n \"He\u2019s just a good kid. How could you not like him?\" \n \n It\u2019s all part of the legend of Schwarber, the 23-year-old who became the Cubs\u2019 all-time postseason home run leader last year by hitting five homers in just 27 at-bats, and now is doing what no one can possibly believe they\u2019re seeing. \n \n \"For a guy to be able to do something like this,\" winning pitcher Jake Arrieta said. \"is just ... I\u2019m kind of speechless.\" \n \n In the words of Cleveland manager Terry Francona, who suffered his first World Series loss a manager in 10 games: \"I can see why Theo (Epstein) sent a plane for him. I would too. That\u2019s a lot to ask, but special players can do special things.\" \n \n Epstein, president of the Cubs, was stunned when the six-month medical reports last week revealed Schwarber was a month ahead of schedule. Schwarber was so excited, he asked for permission to go to the Arizona Fall League, to see how he looked. He played two games, did all the agility drills, ran the bases, slid, and with Epstein watching the video of him on his computer, took the gamble. He sent a private plane for him Monday, and on Tuesday, was in the starting lineup batting fifth. \n \n Now, the question an inquiring, starving, championship-drought fan base wants to know: Could the Cubs dare put him in the field this weekend against the Indians? They are going back to National League rules. There will be no DH at Wrigley Field. Can he possibly play the field when he hasn\u2019t played the outfield since tearing two knee ligaments on April 7? \n \n \"He may be catching for all we know,\" Rizzo said. \n \n Well, it\u2019s safe to say he won\u2019t be catching until next spring, but considering the way he\u2019s running the bases every time he\u2019s aboard, there\u2019s a certain manager who will be pushing for the cause. \n \n \"I'm waiting to hear from our guys from our medical side,\" Cubs manager Joe Maddon said, \"because obviously he looks good. He looks good at the plate. Running the bases, he looks pretty good so far. \n \n \"There's nothing about watching him that tells me that he's inhibited right now. \n \n \"He\u2019s a different cat, he absolutely is.\" \n \n It\u2019s one thing if there had been the scintilla of discussion that Schwarber could possibly be ready for the playoffs, even privately among the Cubs\u2019 front office. Or even if Schwarber had told a few teammates that this was his secret plan all along. But nothing. Absolutely nothing. \n \n Sure, there were times during the season when Schwarber would tease his teammates, saying he\u2019d be back for that day-night doubleheader in August against the Milwaukee Brewers, and everyone would laugh. It was a running joke all season. The laughter stopped when Rizzo was having dinner with strength coach Tim Buss before Game 3 of the NLCS in Los Angeles. \n \n \"I said, 'What?' \" Rizzo said. \" 'Seriously? For real?' I couldn\u2019t believe it.\" \n \n The Cubs still can\u2019t. \n \n \"I just took it day by day,\" Schwarber said. \"There were days I just wasn\u2019t feeling it. My teammates picked me up and I had some guys come over and say to me, 'World Series, you\u2019re coming back.\u2019 I\u2019d just laugh it off. \n \n \"Then, when it came to reality, it was a shock.\" \n \n Imagine how the rest of us feel. \n \n \"The Legend of Kyle Schwarber,\" Ross slowly said again. \n \n Stay tuned. The sequel is Friday, the first World Series night game in Wrigley Field history. \n \n \"They are going to go nuts,\" Ross said. \n \n Follow Nightengale on Twitter and Facebook \n \n Gallery: Cubs, Indians clash in World Series ||||| CLEVELAND \u2014 \u201cThey\u2019re going to make a movie about him,\u201d Kris Bryant said. \n \n Bryant might be right. But even after two jaw-dropping performances, the climax of \u201cLegend: The Amazing Comeback of Kyle Schwarber,\u201d lies ahead. \n \n Yes, the word, \u201clegend,\u201d is admittedly lofty for a player who is only 23, but that\u2019s the description several of his teammates chose, not me. \n \n Filming resumes Friday night at Wrigley Field, in Game 3 of the World Series, with the Cubs and Indians tied at one game each. \n \n The next plot twist \u2014 \u201cWill Schwarbs be in left field?\u201d \u2014 likely will not be a twist at all. He will be in left. He will receive a standing ovation for the ages. He will hit a ball into Lake Michigan, and then ride a chariot down Michigan Avenue, woe to any billy goat that stands in the way. \n \n The Cubs, according to president of baseball operations Theo Epstein, have yet to decide whether Schwarber will be in the outfield. Doctors initially cleared him only to hit and run the bases, serve as a DH. But the Cubs will talk to the doctors again on Friday. \n \n The team does not intend to put Schwarber in jeopardy. But Epstein and others say they view him as healed from the surgery he underwent to repair two damaged ligaments a little more than six months ago. \n \n \u201cHe\u2019s got tremendous strength and flexibility in the knee, as demonstrated by what he\u2019s done out there,\u201d Epstein said, referring to Schwarber\u2019s double and walk in Game 1, his two RBI singles and walk in Game 2, the quality of his at-bats overall. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019ll see. If he does end up playing out there, we\u2019ll make sure he\u2019s smart about it. If he doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ll put him in a big spot (as a pinch-hitter) to take one of the most important at-bats of the game.\" \n \n Three days ago, a lot of people thought the Cubs were nuts to even consider giving Schwarber his first start since April 7 in Game 1 of the World Series. Now, many of those same people are saying, \u201cHow can the Cubs not keep playing him?\u201d \n \n There is risk. There is always risk. At some point, this becomes a question of protecting Schwarber from himself. \u201cHe\u2019ll run through a wall. He\u2019ll do anything,\u201d Cubs general manager Jed Hoyer said. \u201cBut that\u2019s on us to make sure we check all the right boxes.\u201d \n \n Schwarber prepared for the Series by tracking 1,300 pitches from a pitching machine at the Cubs\u2019 spring-training facility in Mesa, Az. He did not, however, track 1,300 flyballs. And he was a below-average outfielder even before he got injured in a collision with center fielder Dexter Fowler. \n \n Still, as Epstein indicated, the Cubs can proceed with relative caution. Replace Schwarber for defense if they get a lead. Use him off the bench in Games 4 and 5, when two flyball pitchers, John Lackey and Jon Lester, are scheduled to pitch. \n \n Heck, the Cubs will benefit even if Schwarber cannot play the field and is limited to one at-bat per game. In Game 1, Schwarber hit a double off a dominant Corey Kluber and drew a walk off the hellacious Andrew Miller. In Game 2, he drilled one RBI single off Trevor Bauer on a 3-0 count, the other off reliever Bryan Shaw after falling behind 0-2. \n \n He has seen 40 pitches in nine plate appearances, a rate that would nearly have led the majors if sustained over a full season. He is hitting as if he missed no time, taking pitches inches off the plate, repeating his short, powerful swing with seemingly no effort. You hear baseball people talk about players who can roll out of bed and hit. Schwarber practically did. \n \n \u201cThe professional at-bats just blow my mind,\u201d catcher David Ross said. \u201cThe eye he has at the plate, taking pitches, taking walks. There is not a more impressive thing that I\u2019ve seen in a long time than the Andrew Miller at-bat (Tuesday). I thought (manager) Joe (Maddon) might pinch-hit for him. Who\u2019s the idiot? Me.\u201d \n \n Yet, the Cubs are the people least surprised by all this. They understand that Schwarber possesses rare offensive gifts. They know how much he cares about the club. And they saw how hard he worked to return. \n \n \u201cThis guy has been running in pools, doing rehab stuff the entire summer, hoping somehow he could contribute,\u201d Hoyer said. \u201cWe let him rehab in Chicago because he was such a big part of it, so great to be around. \n \n \u201cA lot of guys we wouldn\u2019t have allowed to stay here. But with him, he\u2019s such a good teammate, he wants it so badly. If he had any possibility he was going to come back and help us, he was going to do it.\u201d \n \n Most players, Ross said, would have \u201cchecked out\u201d after suffering such a major injury; they would have gone home, done their rehab, played with their kids and prepared for the following season. \n \n Schwarber was different. Schwarber always was part of the team. \n \n \u201cAll of this was for these guys in the clubhouse and our organization,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t for me.\u201d \n \n The players could not help but notice. \n \n \u201cHe stayed locked in when he was hurt,\u201d Ross said. \u201cMentally, he\u2019s been competing in his mind for a long time with us. \n \n \u201cOur new weight room has all mirrors. You look in there and he was in a full sweat by the time I get to the field. He\u2019s got his day in before we start and he stays, does all his rehab, stays for the game, grinds out the game with us, cheering guys on, watching video, doing scouting reports. He\u2019s a baseball rat.\u201d \n \n Call Hollywood. Hold Wrigley. And if the doctors say OK, clear out left field. \n \n Lights! Schwarber! Action!",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Even those not paying close attention to the World Series might be hearing the name Kyle Schwarber being thrown around a lot after the first two games. As in, \"The Legend of Kyle Schwarber\" as the Chicago Cubs catcher puts it, per USA Today. The 23-year-old suffered a devastating knee injury in the third game of the season on April 7 and sat out the rest of the year. In a surprise move, the Cubs put him back in the lineup for the World Series as a designated hitter. After doubling in Game 1\u2014one of the few bright spots for the Cubs that game, which came after TV analyst Pete Rose predicted he'd strike out three times\u2014Schwarber had two RBI singles in the Cubs' Game 2 victory and scored another run himself.

And his \"eye\" at the plate is astonishing his teammates, notes the Chicago Tribune. The problem for the Cubs is that Schwarber is not medically cleared to play the outfield, but that could change before Friday's game in Chicago, where no designated hitter is allowed.

But when she explained that she was already happy with how she looked, the conversation took an odd turn. \n \n The unnamed trainer began to shame her for not trying to \"look her best\" in her wedding photos. Ugh. \n \n Luckily, his misguided comments did not bring the bride-to-be down. She schooled him, and when she posted the screenshots on Facebook last week, she added an important message: your appearance does not define your self worth. \n \n Cassie ends the post by stating, \"Life is waiting for you. It's too short to be spent worrying about a belly roll. Go be happy and live it to your fullest.\" \n \n SEE ALSO: Nude blogger thanks Instagram for suspending her account and proving her point about censorship \n \n After the post went viral, other Facebook users were disgusted by the trainer's tactic of getting a new client and completely supported Cassie's body-positivity in the comments. \n \n Hell yeah. Further proof there's no such thing as the right or wrong size. ||||| Part of the exchange a woman received from a fitness trainer, who body-shamed her. (Photo: Cassie Young via Facebook) \n \n A personal trainer who tried to body-shame a woman for declining his services received a humbling dress-down on social media. \n \n Cassie Young, 31, is a digital director at the nationally syndicated radio show \u201cThe Bert Show,\u201d where she regularly shares her past struggles with body acceptance. Last week, after getting engaged to her boyfriend of nine years, Young received a message from a personal trainer (whose identity she doesn\u2019t reveal), offering to help her \u201cshape up\u201d for the big day. When Young politely declined his offer, things got\u2026 weird. \n \n On Thursday, Young posted screenshots of the exchange to her Facebook page. \u201cCongratulations on your engagement,\u201d wrote the man. \u201cHire me to help you get in shape for your wedding.\u201d \n \n Young replied, \u201cI am in shape! Thank you so much for the offer, though.\u201d \n \n You might think the conversation ended there \u2014 but wait. \n \n \u201cI know you want to look your best on your wedding day,\u201d the man pressed. \u201cIf you don\u2019t hire me, hire someone.

You can\u2019t lie to yourself\u2026 I just wish the whole big body acceptance people would accept the fact that they are not happy with their bodies.\u201d \n \n Young replied, \u201cI\u2019m sad for you that your self-worth is wrapped up in your appearance. You clearly place a lot of stock in looks but fail to understand that not everyone wants to be chained to that insecurity.\u201d She also added: \u201cYou are perpetuating the problem and I refuse to play that game. I reject your notion of operating on superficiality and looks, and I embrace my inner health goals.\u201d \n \n Still, the man would not let up. Read the entire exchange here. \n \n \u201cI saw his messages while lying in bed at 9:30 p.m. and initially I wasn\u2019t offended because he was just offering his services,\u201d Young tells Yahoo Beauty. \u201cThen I started to think about his position of power and any women he may be exploiting by preying on their insecurities.\u201d \n \n Young would know \u2014 after a fifth-grade classmate embarrassed her for wearing size 5 jeans, she spent years counting calories and embarking on yo-yo diets. \u201cI would sit in my closet and cry because I wore sweatpants to work every day for two weeks because no other pair fit,\u201d she tells Yahoo Beauty. \u201cBut last year I decided to invest in clothes that fit and have modeling photos taken \u2014 I\u2019m tired of telling myself I\u2019m not pretty because I have fat rolls.\u201d \n \n She added, \u201cThis guy tried to undo the work I\u2019ve done and plant a seed of doubt in my head during my engagement.\u201d \n \n Despite the trainer\u2019s comments, Young refuses to publicly name him. \u201cI want this to be a learning opportunity,\u201d she tells Yahoo Beauty, adding that putting him on blast would deter that from happening. \u201cNo one should be vilified because they\u2019re ignorant.\u201d \n \n Read more from Yahoo Style + Beauty: \n \n Follow us on Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.

That was the inception moment.\" After some brainstorming, he registered the domain name that night. \n \n See also: 8 ways introverts can crush online dating \n \n The website features all the traditional elements of a dating site, with customizable profiles, photos and ratings. For $12.55 a month, users can private message and partake in online chats with other users. Where the website differs from other sites is in its questions, which ask users to share their favorite Disney songs, characters, parks and memories. \n \n \"My hope is that people literally around the world will find the site useful,\" Tavres said. \"Just as there are big Disney fans near Disneyland and Disney World, that same single fan-base also lives near Tokyo Disney, Disneyland Paris and other Disney parks.

    "document": "AFTER THE 76ERS had acquired Julius Erving before the 1976-77 season, the team went on a run of being eliminated in the NBA Finals three times and the Eastern Conference Finals twice in a six-year span. While those teams were composed of other star-level players such as Doug Collins, George McGinnis, Bobby Jones, Darryl Dawkins and Lloyd Free, to name a few, there was an ingredient missing. Billy Cunningham, who took over as head coach before the 1977-78 season, knew exactly what it was. \"What we needed was that physical presence,\" Cunningham said yesterday. \"As good as Darryl and Caldwell Jones were, they weren't able to take us to the next level. With Doc [Erving] and Bobby Jones and the others, we had great athletes. We needed exactly what we got.\" \n \n What the Sixers got in the summer of 1982 was Moses Malone, the player everyone thought could take the organization to the promised land. He delivered, carrying the team to its only title since the 1967 season. Though he promised to deliver the title in \"Fo', fo', fo' \" fashion, the team actually needed 13 games to garner the championship after a sweep of the Los Angeles Lakers in the championship series. \n \n Malone passed away yesterday morning in his sleep in Norfolk, Va., at the age of 60. Sadly, the two players from whom Malone took over the center position - Dawkins and Caldwell Jones - also died in the past year, from heart attacks. \n \n In his first season with the Sixers, Malone won MVP honors by averaging 24.5 points and 15.3 rebounds during the regular season in which the team compiled a 65-17 record. In those 13 playoff games, in which the Sixers stomped their way to the championship in three series, Malone averaged 26 points and 15.8 rebounds, garnering Finals MVP. \n \n \"I was just with him and Darryl at the ceremony at the Wells Fargo Center when the team unveiled their new uniforms [in mid-June] and then had lunch with Moses and Bobby Jones a couple of weeks after that,\" Cunningham said. \"As always, he was so much fun to be around.\" \n \n When the name of Moses Malone comes up, it is usually followed by laughs and a story. John Nash, who was assistant general manager for the Sixers when Malone was acquired from the Houston Rockets, shared one yesterday. \n \n \"I could write a play about us acquiring Moses,\" said Nash. \"[Owner] Harold Katz called me on a Sunday and said he wanted to get it done. But he was in Las Vegas, [general manager] Pat Williams was in China with Julius on a goodwill tour for the NBA, Billy was in North Carolina on a golf trip and Moses was in Houston. Somehow, we got everyone together, except for Billy, at 7 o'clock that Tuesday night in the Grand Hyatt in New York. We waited for Billy for about 30-to-45 awkward minutes before he came into the room, with his golf clubs over his shoulder. When we asked what took him so long, he said the cab ride was too expensive from Newark Airport, so he took the train in. \n \n \"It took until 2:30 in the morning to iron things out, and about two weeks later the deal was finally officially done - though Moses decided to go on a radio station in Virginia the morning after we talked and announced he had signed with the Sixers. It was crazy.\" \n \n At the time, the deal was the largest for a player in team sports. Malone's contract was for six years at $2.2 million a season. After he averaged 23.9 points and 13.4 rebounds in four seasons, the Sixers traded him and forward Terry Catledge to the Washington Bullets for Jeff Ruland in one of the most-hated deals in Philly sports history. He would return in 1993-94 and average 17.1 points and 13.2 rebounds at age 38 in his next-to-last season. \n \n But few players in this city's sports history, maybe none, connected with the fans with their style of play the way Malone did. There was that ever-present scowl when he was on the court, soaked with sweat, and that jovial smile and large laugh when he was off it that drew so many to embrace him. \n \n \"When we got him, we knew all about him,\" said Maurice Cheeks, the starting point guard on that 1983 team. \"He was an MVP. He had great numbers. But we didn't know who he was. Well, it didn't take long for us to mesh with him on the court, and it certainly didn't take long to love him off of it, too. \n \n \"When I think of Moses, besides the numbers and the great player, he was a great person. I just think of that laugh. I can still hear it. He would still tease me about pancakes. We had a noon game one time in Milwaukee and Moses was a little late coming down from his room. He saw me eating pancakes and asked me for some. I said no and he couldn't believe it. He teased me for years about those pancakes. It breaks me down to think this has happened.\" \n \n In that initial meeting in New York, Cunningham pulled Malone aside and let him know his expectations of the player who had won MVP honors in Houston the previous season by averaging 31.1 points and 14.7 rebounds. \n \n \"Before we signed, we went into a room and I asked if he could deal with what we want to do,\" Cunningham said. \"I said that we expected him to rebound defensively and get it out and let us run as much as we could, then we'd look for you inside. He said he was 100 percent on board. \n \n \"A lot of players were unsettled by the trades we made, popular guys like Darryl and Caldwell. But after two days in training camp with Moses, they understood. Moses' favorite player was Julius. He would just like to play, leave and not talk to anybody. His hero was Doc and he wanted to win it for him. Moses was the smartest player I've been around in my life. Moses knew every player, their strengths and weaknesses, everybody on the court. He was just a basketball junkie.\" \n \n Malone grew up in Petersburg, Va., and signed a contract with the ABA's Utah Stars following high school. He played two seasons in the ABA before bursting onto the scene in the NBA, where he played 19 seasons. He was a 12-time NBA All-Star, won three MVPs and led the league in rebounding six times. He averaged at least 20 points for 11 straight seasons, was named to the league's 50th anniversary all-time team in 1995 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame in 2001. \n \n Said Sixers CEO Scott O'Neil in a statement: \"It is with a deep sense of sadness that the Sixers family mourns the sudden loss of Moses Malone. It is difficult to express what his contributions to this organization - both as a friend and player - have meant to us, the city of Philadelphia and his faithful fans. Moses holds a special place in our hearts and will forever be remembered as a genuine icon and pillar of the most storied era in the history of Philadelphia 76ers basketball.

Maybe they could use her couponing expertise? \n \n Lucia Peters is BettyConfidential\u2019s associate editor. ||||| \n \n Kate Gosselin: coupon expert. (Andy Kropa - GETTY IMAGES) \n \n When Kate Gosselin\u2019s reality show \u201cKate Plus 8\u201d got canceled in August, many of you were concerned about her potential employment options. \n \n All right, fine. You weren\u2019t really that concerned. You were actually overjoyed. \n \n Still, Gosselin is a mom, like many of us, and she needs to support her kids. Which is why I am happy to find out that she has a new job: She is now a coupon blogger for the Web site CouponCabin.com. \n \n CouponCabin.com announced the news in a press release that conveyed the Web site\u2019s excitement over its new hire, who is \u201ca longtime advocate of couponing.\u201d \n \n \u201cKate has embraced coupons her entire life,\u201d said Jackie Warrick, president at CouponCabin.com, according to the press release. \u201cWe look forward to sharing the unique insight she has gained over the years.\u201d \n \n Added Gosselin: \u201cNo matter what your financial situation is, there\u2019s no reason not to use coupons. It\u2019s like free money in your pocket!\u201d \n \n The former reality star will begin her new job officially on Nov. 22, at which time she will blog about how to navigate Black Friday. Future topics, according to the press release, include how to stretch a budget for a large family and holiday shopping tips. \n \n Chuckle heartily over this tidbit all you like, but I genuinely think this is great news for three reasons. \n \n 1. It keeps Gosselin\u2019s kids off of television . . . at least for now. \n \n As previously noted, a mom\u2019s got to eat and she needs to make sure her children do, too. If she can do that by writing about the best way to save cash on detergent or action figures, what\u2019s the harm? Of course, the CouponCabin.com blogging gig may not be enough to pay the bills. I mean, we can\u2019t all engage in the mindblowingly lucrative work of blogging about celebrities and pop culture. (I just typed that sentence while gazing at my diamond-encrusted fingernails as they tappa-tapped on my keyboard, which is made out of genuine leather and features function keys ensconced in imported silk.) But even if this keeps her busy and semi-compensated for a while \u2014 and less focused on the new TV deal she said she wants earlier this week on \u201cThe View\u201d \u2014 this is a good thing. \n \n 2. Her blog entries may provide fodder for Celebritology blog entries that compare Gosselin\u2019s shopping tips to Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s shopping tips from Goop. \n \n And the comments on those Celebritology posts will be so rich with gleeful sarcasm that they may incite a phenomenon scientists have long predicted: the Big Snark Bang. Sure, both the blogosphere and the universe may immediately combust as a result. But it will be worth it. \n \n 3. As a result of Gosselin\u2019s new job, CouponCabin.com just got a lot more publicity. \n \n And that\u2019s super-exciting because, as Gosselin noted in the aforementioned press release, CouponCabin.com is the place where you can easily find the best deals on practically everything. \n \n And there are two things we all need more of in these challenging times: great deals on practically everything and Kate Gosselin. ||||| Kate Gosselin can ease up on the \"freaking out\": The out-of-work reality star has a job now -- a part-time gig, at least. \n \n Gosselin, whose \"Kate Plus 8\" reality show took its last breath in September, will be a contributing blogger for click-and-save website Coupon Cabin. \n \n \"I've never quit a job in my life without having something else lined up,\" she told People at the time. \"I don't know what's next.\" She had been considering going back to nursing, but didn't see how that was going to allow her to provide for her eight kidlets. \n \n (Note: Kate confirmed Monday on \"The View\" that a return to nursing was a no-go, as she'd found her calling on TV.

    "document": "The Patriots have been busy inside Gillette Stadium, formulating a response to the Ted Wells report on Deflategate. \n \n The Patriots escalated their high-stakes counterattack against the NFL and the Wells investigation of Tom Brady\u2019s deflated footballs Thursday by launching a website to publish an exhaustive rebuttal portraying the inquiry\u2019s findings as a Kafkaesque injustice. \n \n The 20,000-word rebuttal includes a Nobel laureate\u2019s rejection of the Wells Report\u2019s scientific evidence and a stunning claim that team attendant Jim McNally referred to himself as \u201cthe deflator\u2019\u2019 because he was losing weight \u2014 not because he was removing air pressure from Brady\u2019s footballs. \n \n The website went up shortly before the NFL players\u2019 union officially appealed Brady\u2019s four-game suspension for allegedly having \u201cat least a general awareness\u2019\u2019 of the scandal and failing to fully cooperate with investigators. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \u201cThe conclusions of the Wells Report are, at best, incomplete, incorrect, and lack context,\u2019\u2019 stated the rebuttal\u2019s author, Daniel L. Goldberg, a Patriots lawyer. \n \n Get Sports Headlines in your inbox: The Globe's most recent sports headlines delivered to your inbox every morning. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here \n \n Two days after chief investigator Ted Wells took the unusual step of publicly defending his integrity, the Patriots accused him of ignoring inconsistencies \u201cin logic and evidence\u2019\u2019 and of assigning nefarious motives to texted \u201cattempts at humor and exaggeration.\u2019\u2019 The team contended that he had essentially manipulated the evidence to show that Brady preferred underinflated footballs and that McNally and equipment assistant John Jastremski probably cheated to satisfy Brady\u2019s desires. \n \n A spokeswoman for Wells said he had no comment on the rebuttal. \n \n On their new website, wellsreportcontext.com, the Patriots acknowledged no wrongdoing by Brady, McNally, or Jastremski. Nor did they offer an explanation for why they indefinitely suspended McNally and Jastremski last week without pay, except to assert that Jastremski secretly gave McNally Patriots sneakers and gear without permission. \n \n Goldberg\u2019s rebuttal repeatedly characterized Wells\u2019s interpretation of events and evidence as flawed or offered alternative explanations. One of Goldberg\u2019s most jarring assertions was aimed at countering Wells\u2019s interpretation of McNally describing himself as \u201cthe deflator.\u2019\u2019 \n \n Advertisement \n \n To Wells, the statement was evidence of possible wrongdoing. To the Patriots, it was innocuous wordplay. \n \n While Jastremski is thin and works out to bulk up, Goldberg stated, \u201cMr. McNally is a big fellow and had the opposite goal: to lose weight. \u2018Deflate\u2019 was a term they used to refer to losing weight.\u2019\u2019 \n \n Goldberg cited two texts from McNally to Jastremski to support his conclusion. In one, McNally wrote, \u201cdeflate and give somebody that jacket.\u2019\u2019 \n \n In the other, they were discussing women and a party (the Patriots redacted part of the exchange \u201cout of respect to Mrs. Jastremski.\u2019\u2019). McNally, apparently referring to himself, texted Jastremski in part, \u201cJimmy needs some kicks . . . lets make a deal . . . come on help the deflator.\u2019\u2019 \n \n Several minutes later, after receiving no reply, McNally wrote, \u201cChill buddy im just [messing] with you . . . im not going to espn . . . yet.\u2019\u2019 \n \n Advertisement \n \n Wells described the exchange as compelling evidence that McNally was threatening to disclose the alleged football deflation scheme to the media. \n \n To the contrary, Goldberg wrote, McNally was mocking Jastremski\u2019s concern that his boss would discover he had secretly been giving McNally sneakers and other Patriots property. It was \u201cMr. McNally\u2019s way of saying, in substance: \u2018Hey, don\u2019t worry about whether giving me those sneakers will get you in trouble \u2014 I\u2019ll never tell,\u2019 \u2019\u2019 Goldberg asserted. \n \n In his voluminous rebuttal, Goldberg stated unequivocally that no evidence has surfaced of Brady saying he prefers his footballs deflated below the league\u2019s minimum pressure standard of 12.5 pounds per square inch. Witness testimony appears to confirm that every time the topic arose, Brady made clear he wanted the footballs inflated to the lowest permissible level. \n \n Goldberg also provides an alternative explanation for Brady engaging in six phone calls for nearly 55 minutes with Jastremski over three days, beginning at 7:26 the morning after news of the purported scandal broke in the hours after the AFC Championship game. \n \n Wells depicted the purpose of the calls as damage control. Not so, according to Goldberg, who asserted Brady reached out to Jastremski because he apparently anticipated a \u201cmedia frenzy\u2019\u2019 about the deflated balls and was concerned for a co-worker who lacked experience dealing with the media. \n \n \u201cMr. Brady\u2019s reaching out to Mr. Jastremski to see how he was holding up in these circumstances is not only understandable, but commendable,\u2019\u2019 Goldberg wrote. \n \n He said the phone calls were \u201ctotally consistent with complete innocence.\u2019\u2019 \n \n Wells, in defending his report to the media Tuesday, described a text exchange between McNally and Jastremski that convinced him \u201cin the bottom of my heart\u2019\u2019 that they were implicating Brady in the alleged deflation conspiracy. \n \n McNally, unhappy that Brady had complained about his footballs being overinflated in a game against the New York Jets, texted to Jastremski: \u201cTom sucks . . . im going make that next ball a [expletive] balloon.\u2019\u2019 \n \n Jastremski replied, \u201cTalked to him last night. He actually brought you up and said you must have a lot of stress trying to get them done.\u2019\u2019 \n \n Wells described the exchange as direct evidence that \u201ctwo participants in the scheme\u2019\u2019 were helping Brady. \n \n Wrong, according to Goldberg, who asserted the \u201cTom\u2019\u2019 in question was not Brady but a friend of Jastremski\u2019s. He said the conversation involved \u201cMcNally\u2019s stress relating to reselling family tickets\u2019\u2019 to Patriots games. \n \n Goldberg said the Patriots made Jastremski\u2019s friend, Tom, available for a phone interview with Wells\u2019s team. But \u201cthe investigators, rather than take further steps to check out this information, simply chose to disbelieve input that did not square with their conclusions,\u2019\u2019 Goldberg wrote. \n \n He also took issue with Wells\u2019s complaint that the Patriots refused to make McNally available for a final interview with investigators. Wells said the interview was crucial because he had discovered McNally\u2019s \u201cdeflator\u2019\u2019 texts after his first conversation with McNally and needed to confront him about them. \n \n Wells has cited the refusal to make McNally available again as evidence of the Patriots\u2019 failure to cooperate. \n \n Goldberg countered that Wells received the \u201cdeflator\u2019\u2019 texts before his first interview with McNally but overlooked them. When Wells sought the second interview, Goldberg said, the Patriots offered alternatives to an in-person interview to provide the information Wells needed. \n \n \u201cThere was no follow-up from investigators,\u2019\u2019 Goldberg wrote. \u201cIt now appears that the Patriots are being severely punished because the Wells investigative team apparently overlooked materials they had in their possession long before their interview with Mr. McNally.\u2019\u2019 \n \n Goldberg suggested Wells also ignored scientific evidence that atmospheric pressure may have accounted for Brady\u2019s underinflated footballs when the Patriots played the Indianapolis Colts Jan. 18 in the AFC Championship game. \n \n As part of a detailed analysis that raised questions not only about which gauges the officials used to measure the Patriots footballs but the league\u2019s apparent lax attention to the inflation levels of the Colts\u2019 balls, Goldberg cited the conclusions of Roderick MacKinnon, a 2003 Nobel Prize recipient in chemistry, that Wells\u2019s scientific findings were \u201cincorrect.\u2019\u2019 \n \n The new Patriots website initially stated MacKinnon offered them his expertise and had no personal relationship with the team. \n \n Several hours later, after reports of a possible conflict of interest arose, the Patriots updated the site to say they are a passive investor in MacKinnon\u2019s biotechnology company, Flex Pharma. \n \n The team was fined $1 million and docked two draft picks \u2014 a first-rounder in 2016 and fourth-rounder in 2017. \n \n Bob Hohler can be reached at robert.hohler@globe.com ||||| Introduction \n \n It has been 10 months since the 139-page Wells Report and the accompanying 82-page Exponent Report were issued. Within a week, we created this website and posted an initial, detailed critique of the analysis and conclusions of those reports. Since then, independent critiques of the Wells and Exponent Reports have multiplied and scientists across the country who examined the PSI and weather data have concluded that science fully explains the PSI measurements found in the Wells Report. We have posted a collection of those positions on this website and they remain available for review here. Many thoughtful people have, with further information and consideration, revised their initial impressions, which were largely based on false information leaked by League personnel and on the interpretations put on ambiguous, at best, facts by the League and its lawyers. \n \n The League, however, in pursuing its legal strategies, has escalated its defense of the Wells Report and its conclusions, often at the expense of accuracy. In addition, to preserve the public impressions of the Wells Report and the League\u2019s pursuit of Tom Brady, the League rejected the suggestion of measuring PSI during every game in the 2015 season and publishing the results. Instead, it chose to perform \u201crandom spot checks\u201d during the season and then refused to release the results of those checks, no doubt because doing so would confirm that there was nothing unusual about footballs falling below regulation in cold weather. \n \n Many of the flaws in the Wells and Exponent Reports have been exposed. The detailed scientific critiques of the Exponent Report have been explored by experts. But many of the dubious bases for the Wells Report remain unexplored. For these reasons, we post below our counsel Daniel L. Goldberg\u2019s further review of the circumstances that led to the League\u2019s investigation and the League\u2019s bases for continuing its pursuit of Tom Brady and the discipline imposed on the Patriots. We hope that it will induce added examination by those who are interested and allow them to reach their own conclusions regarding this matter and how the PSI of the footballs at the AFC Championship Game in January 2015 came to be under 12.5 PSI. \n \n The Background \n \n The day before the AFC Championship Game on Jan. 18, 2015, the general manager of the Indianapolis Colts sent an email to the League raising concerns about the air pressure of game balls used by the New England Patriots. He did not ask the League to take any steps before the game to keep control of the game balls the next day or do anything else to ensure that the game balls would meet regulation. Rather, he suggested that the game balls used by the Patriots be checked \u201cas the game goes on.\u201d In response, the League took no precautionary steps in advance of the game and did not notify the Patriots of the concerns. Nor did the League consider the potential impact of weather on PSI, because the League was completely unaware of such impact. When League personnel gauged footballs at halftime, it was the first time in the League\u2019s 95 year history they had done so. They found that the PSI levels of the Patriots footballs used in the first half had fallen below the range prescribed by the Official Rules of the NFL. Unfortunately, the League drew conclusions about the reasons for those PSI levels without taking into account the effect of weather or the Ideal Gas Law, a scientific equation that explains that for every drop in temperature there will be a corresponding, and calculable, drop in PSI. \n \n The data collected that night showed expected drops in PSI. Unfortunately for all involved, the League leaked inaccurate PSI numbers to ESPN shortly after the AFC Championship Game. The leaked misinformation sparked a firestorm of speculation and a presumption of guilt that the Patriots and Tom Brady were forced to address. A recent ESPN public editor column addressed the League\u2019s leak. The accurate data would not be revealed by the League until over 15 weeks later, on May 6, 2015, when the Wells Report was made public. In the 10 months since, the Wells Report and the accompanying report by Exponent, the scientific consultants hired by the League\u2019s lawyers (despite Exponent\u2019s history of questionable findings, including that second-hand smoke causes no health risks), have been widely criticized by journalists, professors, lawyers and countless others. For example, Malcolm Gladwell, the well-known author of \u201cThe Tipping Point,\u201d has referred to the Wells Report as \u201castonishing garbage.\u201d The scientific flaws of Exponent\u2019s analysis have received extensive scrutiny by independent scientists, engineers and mathematicians, who have no link to any party but are interested in the science that formed the foundation of the Wells Report. Once these independent minds had a chance to review the true data \u2014 not the erroneous data leaked by the League at the outset \u2014 and match it up with science, the scientific explanation of the PSI of the footballs on Jan. 18 became undeniably clear and completely contradicted the findings in the flawed Wells and Exponent Reports. \n \n Rule 2 in the NFL\u2019s Official Rule Book prescribes a range of 12.5 to 13.5 PSI for footballs used in games. This PSI range has been in place for decades. It did not derive from any competitive concerns over air pressure. There has never been a study of whether football air pressure has any impact on game play or whether minor differences in PSI are even discernible to the touch. Rule 2 was apparently based on a recommendation by the manufacturer of the footballs, much like a tire manufacturer provides consumers with a suggested PSI for its tires. In the history of the NFL, prior to January of 2015, the League never paid much attention to what happens to the PSI of footballs during a game, and the PSI of footballs was never measured during or after any game. \n \n Pursuant to Rule 2, footballs are gauged pre-game in the Officials\u2019 Locker Room to check that they are in the permissible PSI range. Even if the footballs measure pre-game at the high end of the range at 13.5 PSI in a 72\u00b0F Officials\u2019 Locker Room, due solely to temperature changes, they will be below regulation during the game if the temperature on the field is below 52\u00b0F. It is also a scientific fact that footballs that are gauged pre-game at the low end of the range, at 12.5 PSI, will be below regulation if the temperature on the field is even slightly below the temperature in the Officials\u2019 Locker Room. Troy Vincent, the League\u2019s top football operations official, who was present at halftime, testified in Tom Brady\u2019s appeal hearing that he had \u201cno idea\u201d that footballs \u201cwere automatically going to lose pressure if it was cold outside compared to how warm it was inside.\u201d He had no familiarity with the Ideal Gas Law. He was not alone. Apparently no game official or anyone at the League had any understanding about the impact of temperature changes on PSI. What was initially seen as scandalous (and, remarkably, continues to be characterized that way by the League) was that the Patriots\u2019 footballs, which measured pre-game at 12.5 or 12.6 PSI, had fallen below regulation after being used in the first half. This circumstance is now generally understood to reflect a basic law of nature, since the 2014 AFC Championship Game was played at an outdoor temperature of 48\u00b0F and the footballs had measured at 12.5 or 12.6 PSI in the 72\u00b0F Officials\u2019 Locker Room prior to the game. The reality is that every NFL game ever played in temperatures under 50\u00b0F likely involved use of under-inflated footballs if they were in the 12.5 to 13.5 PSI range when checked pre-game. The Patriots\u2019 footballs were also wet, having been used in the rain, and it is a scientific fact that wet conditions also affect PSI. \n \n Given the total lack of understanding about how temperature and weather impact the PSI in footballs, accusations of cheating by the Patriots were already being made by League officials during the second half of the AFC Championship Game. Less than 24 hours later, this prejudgment of wrongdoing was officially adopted by the League. In this letter from League Official Dave Gardi to the Patriots the day after the game, Mr. Gardi advised the Patriots that the League had made a \u201cpreliminary finding\u201d that there may have been tampering with the footballs and the League was launching an investigation of the team. The League still had no understanding of the Ideal Gas Law when it sent this letter. \n \n Despite League personnel having recorded the halftime PSI measurements, both Mr. Gardi\u2019s letter to the Patriots and the information leaked by League sources contained significantly inaccurate PSI information, exaggerating the loss of PSI in the Patriots\u2019 footballs. Both also inaccurately stated that, in contrast to the Patriots\u2019 footballs, each of the Colts\u2019 footballs had measured within the permissible PSI range. In actuality, three of the four Colts\u2019 footballs, which started at or above 13.0 PSI, measured below regulation on the gauge that the Wells Report concluded was the proper gauge to consider. Had the actual PSI halftime measurements been released in the days following the game, there would have been a quick scientific assessment and explanation of the situation. Instead, the accurate information was inexplicably kept from the public (and the Patriots) by the League and the League\u2019s lawyers for months. The false information was allowed to fester, creating largely inalterable and inaccurate public perceptions of what happened. \n \n As mentioned above, since the release of the Wells Report, numerous independent scientists have studied the data. Every scientist known to have examined this data since has concluded that the halftime PSI of the Patriots\u2019 footballs was consistent with the Ideal Gas Law. (See, for example, http://sports.yahoo.com/news/1-year-after-deflate-gate-ballooned\u2013science-shows-shame-of-it-all-073316233.html). There has also been widespread independent criticism of Exponent\u2019s methodologies and conclusions. What has been largely overlooked is that even Exponent, the NFL\u2019s paid consultant, found that the Patriots\u2019 halftime PSI numbers were fully explainable by the Ideal Gas Law depending on when, during halftime, those footballs were measured. According to Exponent, if the 11 Patriots footballs were measured, on average, within the first two minutes of halftime, their PSI measurements were fully explained by the Ideal Gas Law. (See Exponent Report at pp. XIII, 54, and 67). Other scientists, taking into account that the Patriots\u2019 footballs were wet, causing them to warm up more slowly, have put that time frame at over four minutes. \n \n The Myths \n \n Myth #1: The NFL\u2019s lawyers told Exponent to assume it took up to 9 minutes of halftime to complete the initial gauging of 11 Patriots\u2019 footballs. \n \n As the Wells Report concedes, \u201cthe analysis of the data is ultimately dependent on assumptions and information that is uncertain\u201d (Wells Report at p. 12), and that \u201cvarying the applicable assumptions can have a material impact on the ultimate conclusions\u201d (Wells Report at p. 13). Exponent\u2019s conclusion that there was an available scientific explanation for the halftime PSI readings was undercut not by facts or science, but by assumptions given to Exponent by the NFL\u2019s lawyers regarding the timing of events at halftime. \n \n According to the NFL\u2019s lawyers, just the gauging of the 11 Patriots footballs took up to 9 minutes: 2 to 4 minutes to start to gauge them and an added 4 to 5 minutes to complete the gauging. No records were kept of the timing of the halftime PSI measurements. Seven League officials witnessed the halftime events, but no interviews recounted in the Wells Report state what any witness said about when the gauging of the Patriots\u2019 footballs began, how long it took, or when it ended. No simulations were done to see how long it might have taken to start and complete the gauging. The information in the Wells Report from the interviews of seven League and Game Officials present at halftime was that: (i) the first thing the Officials did upon entering the Officials\u2019 Locker Room was to gauge 11 Patriots\u2019 footballs; (ii) the Colts\u2019 footballs were gauged sometime thereafter; (iii) only four Colts\u2019 footballs were measured because the Officials \u201cwere running out of time before the start of the second half\u201d (Wells Report at p. 7); and (iv) halftime lasted 13.5 minutes. \n \n Information presented in the Wells Report reflects that the two minute average for measuring the Patriots\u2019 footballs is very likely what happened. The officials hurried into the Officials\u2019 Locker Room at halftime with a plan to gauge all of the Patriots\u2019 and Colts\u2019 footballs. They knew that time was limited and that they needed to act quickly. It takes two to three seconds to gauge a football, as confirmed by the highly-viewed video of a Game Official gauging a football before a 2013 Chicago Bears game, which video was part of a Peter King MMQB report. Further, it is a basic premise of the Wells Report (and of an Exponent study that appears as Appendix 2 to the Exponent Report) that one person, acting alone, can complete the following in less than 100 seconds: (i) enter a room; (ii) lock the door; (iii) take 12 footballs out of a bag; (iv) stick a needle in each of those footballs to remove air; (v) place them back into the bag; (vi) unlock and open the door; and (vii) leave the room. If all that can be completed by one person in roughly 1 minute and 40 seconds, it is reasonable to conclude Messrs. Blakeman and Prioleau could begin to gauge the Patriots\u2019 footballs less than a minute into halftime and complete the gauging in two minutes \u2014 i.e., taking 5 seconds for each man to gauge each football. That timing would support Exponent\u2019s conclusion that science can fully explain the PSI of the Patriots\u2019 footballs. \n \n Under the timing assumptions of Myth #1, the Officials would not have finished their initial gauging of the 11 Patriots\u2019 footballs until up to nine minutes into halftime. That would have left less than five minutes to re-inflate and re-gauge them and, as was their intent (see Wells Report footnote 35), to gauge all of the Colts\u2019 footballs. Using a pump to re-inflate each of the 11 footballs, and then using a gauge to ensure each was within the range of Rule 2, would logically take as long or longer than the four to five minutes the NFL\u2019s lawyers assumed it took just to gauge the 11 footballs in the first instance. If the NFL\u2019s lawyers\u2019 assumptions about timing were accurate, it would mean the Officials could not have completed all these actions, let alone gauging even four Colts\u2019 footballs, during the 13.5 minutes of halftime. \n \n The League\u2019s lawyers have refused to release the interview notes of the seven League witnesses to halftime gauging. They have also refused to release their communications with Exponent. There is no privilege or confidentiality around any of these communications \u2014 they were not attorney-client communications and they were not attorney \u201cwork product\u201d (a term used to refer to materials prepared by lawyers in anticipation of litigation). These communications were made as part of what was supposed to be a transparent, independent fact-finding mission \u2014 not a mission to prepare for litigation. The NFL\u2019s lawyers\u2019 claim of a \u201cwork product\u201d privilege for these interview notes is most curious. Unless there was a prejudgment that the investigation would find violations \u2014 the only circumstance that might lead to anticipated future litigation \u2014 there would be no reason at the time of the interviews to anticipate any litigation. In all events, the League has the right to waive any claims of privilege, and yet has held tight to this critical information. \n \n Myth #2: The Colts\u2019 footballs were gauged immediately after the Patriots\u2019 footballs were gauged, and before the Patriots\u2019 footballs were re-inflated and re-gauged. The NFL\u2019s lawyers told Exponent to assume that the Colts\u2019 footballs were gauged before the Patriots\u2019 footballs were re-inflated, yet the Wells Report does not describe what any of the seven League witnesses present at halftime actually said regarding the sequence of these events. The only relevant information recounted in the Wells Report is that: (i) only four Colts footballs were measured at halftime because the Officials were running out of time as halftime was ending; and (ii) Mr. Blakeman and Mr. Prioleau switched gauges at some point after they finished measuring the Patriots\u2019 footballs and before they started measuring the Colts\u2019 footballs. These facts strongly suggest that the Colts footballs were measured only after the Patriots\u2019 footballs were re-inflated and re-gauged, and as the 13.5 minute halftime was ending. That would explain why, despite the officials\u2019 plan to gauge all the footballs of both teams at halftime, they stopped after only getting to four of the Colts\u2019 footballs. \n \n The most logical sequence of events would also mean the officials likely started to gauge the four Colts\u2019 footballs at least 11 minutes into halftime, after they had warmed up and their PSI had naturally started to return to their original pregame air pressure. This additional time in the warm room fully explains why the Colts\u2019 footballs appeared to lose less PSI than the Patriots\u2019 footballs. However, despite admitted \u201cuncertainty\u201d about the sequence of these events, Exponent was told by the NFL\u2019s lawyers to assume that the gauging of the Colts\u2019 footballs followed immediately after the Patriots\u2019 footballs were gauged and before the re-inflation and re-gauging of the Patriots\u2019 footballs. (Exponent Report at p. 2). All of Exponent\u2019s testing then relied on this instruction \u2014 every simulation done by Exponent was based on starting the gauging of the four Colts\u2019 footballs less than 10 minutes into halftime. This assumed timing was so illogical that, as Exponent admitted, to account for it, Exponent had to manipulate the undisputed 72\u00b0F temperature of the Official\u2019s Locker Room down to 67\u00b0F in some of its calculations. (See Exponent Report at p. 52). As numerous independent scientists have shown, using the more likely sequence of halftime events eliminates any mystery about why Colts\u2019 footballs appeared to lose less PSI than the Patriots\u2019 footballs. \n \n Myth #3: The Patriots\u2019 footballs were not sufficiently wet to affect their PSI. This is another unfounded assumption the NFL\u2019s lawyers told Exponent to make. The Patriots\u2019 footballs measured at halftime were wet from being used in the rain for an extended period during the first half, and they had not been kept in plastic bags on the sidelines (as had the Colts\u2019 footballs). Exponent correctly noted that the Patriots\u2019 footballs were wet (Exponent Report at p. XIII) and that if footballs are wet, it slows the warming process and hence slows how quickly the PSI returns to its pre-game PSI levels. The wet condition of the footballs would impact the halftime PSI of the Patriots\u2019 footballs and extend the two-minute average that Exponent concluded would provide a scientific explanation. )See Professor John Leonard\u2019s transient analysis found here.) However, as stated in the Exponent Report (see p. 55), the NFL\u2019s lawyers instructed Exponent to assume that the footballs were not sufficiently wet for these purposes. \n \n Myth #4: The two gauges used at halftime were the Logo and Non-Logo gauges brought to the Game by Referee Walt Anderson. The Wells Report assumes as fact that Anderson\u2019s personal gauges were used at halftime, whereas the evidence suggests otherwise: (i) as recounted in a footnote buried in the Wells Report (footnote 37), neither Mr. Blakeman nor Mr. Prioleau recalled what gauge each used at halftime; (ii) Mr. Farley, the note-keeper at halftime, wrote down that one of the gauges used at halftime was the gauge brought to the Officials\u2019 Locker Room pre-game by the Patriots (see Wells Report footnote 38); and (iii) the Exponent tests of the Logo and Non-Logo gauges showed they often varied from each other by as much as 0.75 PSI (Exponent Report at p. 29), while the two gauges used at halftime never varied by more than 0.45 PSI (Wells Report at p. 67). This strongly suggests that one of the two gauges used at halftime was actually the Patriots\u2019 gauge \u2014 a gauge that was apparently used by League official James Daniel before halftime to measure the intercepted football (Wells Report footnote 36), but was never tested by Exponent. \n \n Myth #5: Referee Anderson used the Non-Logo gauge pre-game. Despite Mr. Anderson\u2019s \u201cbest recollection\u201d that he used the Logo gauge pre-game, the NFL\u2019s lawyers rejected it. To determine PSI changes from pre-game to halftime, one would have to use the same gauge at halftime that was used by Referee Anderson pre-game, since gauges vary from each other in accuracy. The Logo gauge, at halftime, did not show as much PSI loss as did the Non-Logo gauge, so knowing which gauge was actually used before the game is critical. Referee Anderson expressed no uncertainty about which gauge he had used pre-game. This was not his first time gauging footballs pre-game \u2014 he was a very experienced Referee and likely had a longstanding routine as to which of his two gauges he used and which was the backup. He knew the gauges well. He had used one of the gauges for three or four years and had the other one for at least one year. He clearly knew the differences between them. His \u201cbest recollection\u201d was that he used the Logo gauge before the game. One can imagine a line of questions asked by lawyers during his interview that could lead him to say it was \u201ccertainly possible\u201d that his best memory might be wrong. But it is a fundamental flaw to rely on matters that are merely \u201ccertainly possible\u201d as the foundation for concluding what is \u201cmore likely than not,\u201d the required standard of proof of the investigation. Exponent then went to great lengths to try to bolster the lawyers\u2019 rejection of Mr. Anderson\u2019s best recollection of which gauge he used pre-game, but those efforts have been completely discredited by every subsequent scientific review. \n \n Myth #6: The PSI measurements pre-game and at halftime were scientifically reliable enough to base definitive conclusions on them. Referee Anderson measured 48 footballs pre-game in the Officials\u2019 Locker Room with the footballs spread out around him on the floor. His mission was simply to make sure they were in the permissible range of Rule 2. He was not charged with recording the PSI of each football. The NFL had no protocols for recording any data during the pre-game gauging process, and despite the notice from the Colts, had not adopted any protocols for the AFC Championship game. He did not recall which team\u2019s footballs he measured first. He did his best to recall, days or weeks later, the precise PSI numbers of what, at the time he gauged the footballs, were inconsequential specifics. The same NFL lawyers who rejected his recollection as to which gauge he used nonetheless chose to assume the accuracy of his recollections of precise pre-game PSI numbers of each of 48 footballs, down to a tenth of a pound of PSI. \n \n The halftime gauging and recording of PSI, the first time in the League\u2019s history this was done, followed no prescribed protocols because there were none. The result was, at best, confused and imprecise. No records were kept of when any measurement was started, how long the gauging took, or the sequence of when the Colts\u2019 footballs were measured. Mr. Blakeman and Mr. Prioleau, who did not recall which gauges they used, inadvertently switched the gauges that were being used between gauging the Patriots\u2019 and the Colts\u2019 footballs. They called out their gauge readings to Mr. Farley, who wrote them down but put some of the PSI figures in the wrong columns on the list he was keeping (Wells Report at footnote 41). There was so much apparent confusion, imprecision and lack of recollection that the Wells Report fails to address who re-inflated the Patriots footballs, who re-gauged them, whether each football was again gauged twice, what gauge (or gauges) was used to re-gauge them, when this was done, or even at what PSI the footballs were set after the re-inflation. Only four Colts\u2019 footballs were gauged as halftime was running out. Three of the four Colts\u2019 footballs measured were under regulation on one of the gauges, but no one thought \u2014 or had time to \u2014 re-inflate any of them. It is not difficult to picture the rush to accomplish what had never before been attempted at any halftime of any NFL game. The footballs were delayed getting back to the field for the second half. These halftime measurements were no more precise or reliable than the post-game PSI measurements, which Exponent concluded did not provide \u201ca scientifically reasonable basis\u201d on which to conduct an analysis even though the measurements were \u201crecorded in conditions similar to those conducted at halftime.\u201d (Wells Report footnote 44). Those post-game PSI measurements, discounted by the NFL\u2019s lawyers, showed Colts\u2019 footballs as still being below regulation on one of the gauges, suggesting the Colts played the entire game with below-regulation footballs. \n \n There was so much imprecision about the halftime events that no one seemed to notice there was an extra, unexplained Patriots\u2019 football on Mr. Farley\u2019s list. Rule 2 mandated that, prior to the game, Referee Anderson was to ensure that there were 12 footballs placed in the Patriots \u201cprimary bag\u201d for use during the game. Of those 12 footballs, one was taken out of play and set aside as a souvenir in the first half after James Develin caught a touchdown pass. A second football \u2014 the one intercepted by the Colts \u2014 had been set aside and was not one of the 11 Patriots\u2019 footballs measured at halftime. That left 10 Patriots footballs to be measured at halftime. However, Mr. Farley wrote down that 11 Patriots footballs were measured. Buried in a footnote of the Wells Report (p. 68) is the effort to explain this extra football. Utilizing the same \u201ccertainly possible\u201d approach to witness interviewing, the Wells Report attributes to Mr. Anderson that it was \u201ccertainly possible\u201d there were actually 13 footballs initially put in the primary bag, not the 12 he was responsible to ensure were there. The possibility of an extra football being put in the primary bag raises even further issues about the precision of the pre-game gauging, as well as about what Mr. Anderson actually said, which is in the unreleased interview notes. In all events, what is \u201ccertainly possible\u201d is not \u201cmore likely than not,\u201d which is the required standard of proof for the League to find a rule violation. \n \n Myth #7: The Jastremski/McNally texts are evidence of an ongoing, longstanding scheme to deflate footballs below regulation after the Referee\u2019s pre-game inspection. Despite the absence of a single text ever referring to any a scheme to deflate footballs, the NFL\u2019s lawyers concluded that the text messages evidenced such a scheme. The NFL\u2019s lawyers had access to thousands of texts, starting well before the 2014 NFL season and continuing past the AFC Championship Game. Despite it being clear from the texts that neither Mr. Jastremski nor Mr. McNally thought their texts would ever be seen by others, not a single text directs or recounts a scheme to deflate footballs after the Referee\u2019s pre-game inspection. Not a single text even suggests that Tom Brady would want footballs below regulation. The absence of any texts confirming a scheme to deflate footballs is compelling evidence that there was no such scheme. \n \n The NFL\u2019s lawyers drew all of their inferences from ambiguous texts. Although noting that numerous texts were obviously just attempts at humor, the lawyers felt they could divine which were simply humorous, tongue-in-cheek comments and which were not. The NFL\u2019s brief to the Federal Court of Appeals goes beyond interpreting texts and repeatedly mischaracterizes them. A prime example of manipulating the text evidence is the effort to create the myth that \u201cdeflator\u201d was a frequently-used nickname for Mr. McNally. The Wells Report repeats the term numerous times (and the League\u2019s appeal brief falsely asserts the term was used in texts throughout the 2014 season). It is an undisputed fact that, in the thousands of texts, the term was actually used only once, in a single text sent in the off-season (May 2014), some eight months before the AFC Championship Game. It appears in a string of texts that had nothing to do with footballs. The May 2014 text was so disconnected from footballs and the football season that, in over 20 hours of questioning of Mr. McNally and Mr. Jastremski, the NFL\u2019s lawyers had overlooked it and never asked about it. \n \n Myth #8: The Jastremski/McNally texts did not contradict the existence of any deflation scheme. In fact, there are key texts which contradict the existence of a deflation scheme. Mr. Jastremski and Mr. McNally texted following the Jets game in October 2014, where the footballs used in the game had been significantly over-inflated. Had there been a conspiracy for Mr. McNally to deflate footballs after the Referee\u2019s inspection, Mr. Jastremski\u2019s texts to Mr. McNally would most likely have blamed Mr. McNally for not carrying out the scheme. He did just the opposite, blaming the referees for not re-checking the footballs after adding air to them: \u201cThe refs f\u2019d up.\u201d \u201cThey didn\u2019t recheck them after they put air in them.\u201d Mr. Jastremski also texted his fianc\u00e9 about having gauged the footballs after the Jets game and finding they measured 16 PSI. Most tellingly, he texted: \u201cThey [are] supposed to be 13 lbs.\u201d These texts are inconsistent with the hypothesized scheme to deflate footballs. But since they do not fit with the conclusions of the Wells Report, they were essentially ignored. \n \n Myth #9: McNally secretly left the Official\u2019s Locker Room and sneaked into a nearby bathroom. Mr. McNally\u2019s departure with the football bags from the Official\u2019s Locker Room and his trip to the field with those bags was anything but secretive or surreptitious. The facts recounted in the Wells Report actually show his movements were open and obvious, in plain sight of countless League Officials. As the start of the AFC Championship Game approached, the Game Officials told Mr. McNally to take the two primary bags of footballs from the dressing room of the Official\u2019s Locker Room, where the Game Officials were doing their last-minute game preparations, and into the separate sitting room. The sitting room was so crowded with League Officials that it was described in the Wells Report as being like \u201cGrand Central Station.\u201d Mr. McNally sat at one end of the sitting room with the two large bags of footballs at his feet, watching the NFC Championship Game on TV along with the League Officials. When the NFC overtime game ended abruptly, Mr. McNally hoisted the football bags on his shoulders, walked approximately 15 feet down the entire length of the sitting room, past the League Officials, and went out the door of the Official\u2019s Locker Room into the hallway that leads to the field. He did this in plain sight of all those League Officials. No one stopped him or suggested he needed to be accompanied on his walk to the field. No one described his movements as furtive or hurried. Any League official who wanted to accompany him to the field had numerous opportunities to do so. The hallway, including the entrance to the bathroom, was also monitored by security personnel and a security camera, of which Mr. McNally was aware, given that he had worked in the Stadium on game days since it was built. There was no opportunity to \u201csneak\u201d anywhere. Mr. McNally walked down the hallway past the security personnel and past Mr. Daniel, a League employee who was aware of the email sent by the Colts prior the game, who opted not to accompany him, but again certainly could have. \n \n The bathroom stop was inconsequential, and when asked, Mr. McNally fully explained it. Nonetheless, this supposedly surreptitious bathroom stop was part of the narrative used to manipulate public perception. The security tape showing Mr. McNally\u2019s entrance to and departure from the bathroom was apparently leaked by someone at the League soon after the erroneous PSI information was leaked. It certainly appears that someone at the League wanted to influence public opinion and put pressure on the Patriots. \n \n Myth #10: Tom Brady, despite never having so-stated, and despite all the contrary evidence, wanted to use footballs that were below regulation. The investigation took months and involved dozens of witnesses. None could point to a single statement by Mr. Brady that he preferred under-regulation footballs \u2013 either in games or in practice. The Wells investigators could have sought out former teammates, including backup quarterbacks and receivers, obvious witnesses with whom to explore this issue. They could have probed whether Mr. Brady, at practice, wanted to use under-inflated footballs to prepare. They could have tested whether under-inflated footballs provide a competitive advantage. They could have tested if marginal differences in PSI are discernable to experienced quarterbacks. They did none of these things. \n \n There is not a single witness, text, or any other evidence which supports the premise that Tom Brady wanted footballs at less than 12.5 PSI. The fact that he wanted them at the low end of regulation range \u2013 a preference he stated for the first time on Oct. 16, 2014 after the Jets game when the footballs were vastly over-inflated \u2014 is clearly not evidence that he actually preferred them lower. Indeed, the footballs were set at a consistent PSI for his pre-game inspection and selection (12.6 after the Jets game; 12.7 or 12.8 before that game). Common sense would suggest consistency of footballs \u2014 whether used in practice, in home games, or in away games \u2014 is of obvious importance to a quarterback. If PSI of footballs were important to a quarterback, it is only logical that consistency of that PSI would also be important. But such consistency would only be compromised should someone haphazardly stick a needle in them to remove air, and be able to do so only at home games. The entire point of the 2006 rule change that Tom Brady and other quarterbacks championed was to achieve consistency of footballs used at home games and away games. For Mr. Brady, the key was consistency of tactile feel of the surface of the football. He likes the footballs to feel well-worn; other quarterbacks prefer different surfaces. Before that rule change, the home team prepared the footballs used by both teams, which led to inconsistency of the tactile feel of the footballs at home and away games. The 2006 rule change allowed each team to prepare the footballs they would use in every game, whether home or away. That promoted consistency. The deflation scheme hypothesized by the Wells Report could have happened only at home games, since it is the home team\u2019s staff who takes the footballs from the team\u2019s locker rooms to the Officials\u2019 Locker Room and then to the field. So the purported deflation scheme would have been contrary to the purpose of the 2006 rule change. The Wells Report ignores this point. \n \n There is no evidence that marginal differences in PSI are even discernible to the touch, or that they matter to game play. One can search through every page of the Wells Report for evidence that anyone, including those experienced in handling footballs, can even tell the difference of one pound of PSI in the footballs. Even Rule 2 allows a one pound range. The Game Officials handle the footballs before and after every play and are the only ones who handle both teams\u2019 footballs and can compare how they feel. If there were ascertainable differences in PSI, it is the Game Officials who would be in the position to notice them. They never have. \n \n Nor is there any evidence that differences in PSI provide any competitive advantage. The NFL\u2019s lawyers did not commission any tests to see if there is a difference in feel or performance between, for example, 11.3 PSI footballs and 12.5 PSI footballs. They did not compare Tom Brady\u2019s performances in home and away games. Peter King, in his MMQB column, has conducted that analysis and found there to be virtually no difference in Mr. Brady\u2019s home and away performances. If the League wanted to assess whether there is a competitive advantage from lower PSI footballs, they could compare the performances in games played in cold weather (where the PSI will be lower) to performances in games played in warm climates. That has never been done. \n \n Myth #11: Tom Brady\u2019s statement that he did not think that anyone would tamper with the PSI of the footballs without his knowledge somehow proves that there was tampering and that he knew of it. This statement does not make either the PSI tampering or Mr. Brady\u2019s knowledge of it \u201cmore likely than not,\u201d which is the League\u2019s required standard of proof. It is totally consistent with his testimony that he knew nothing about any such scheme \u2014 and that he does not believe there was such a scheme. No court would allow a decision about his \u201cguilt\u201d to be premised on this statement. Nonetheless, when pressed by Judge Richard Berman for the evidence against Mr. Brady, this statement was a key part of the response from the NFL\u2019s lawyers. \n \n Myth #12: Increased communications between Mr. Brady and Mr. Jastremski after the AFC Championship Game is proof that there was tampering and that Brady knew about it. This Myth is a pillar of the League\u2019s case against Mr. Brady, but reliance on Mr. Brady\u2019s increased texting and communications with Mr. Jastremski after the AFC Championship Game as evidence of guilt actually belies common sense. If one assumes there was the long-running scheme involving Messrs. Brady and Jastremski, then one would also have to assume that the absence of any texts between them while that scheme was being implemented was quite deliberate \u2014 part of a vigilantly followed code of silence. Of course, once the story broke, there would be even more reason to be sure there were no texts being exchanged between them, and particularly none that referred to the breaking story. In fact, of course, on the heels of the matter becoming public, they do just the opposite and start to text freely and frequently. Mr. Brady is obviously curious about the breaking story, which involves footballs that he knew Mr. Jastremski prepared for the AFC Championship game. It would have been far more curious if Brady was being asked about the issue by the media, as he was the morning after the game, and he had not then followed up with the person he knew prepared the footballs. And, independent of the breaking story, Mr. Brady knew that the Super Bowl the team had just qualified for would be an enormous task involving 100+ game balls and decisions about how the footballs would be prepared, when they would be sent to the Super Bowl venue, whether game balls would be available for practice, and a whole host of other immediate decisions as to which Mr. Jastremski had no experience, having not prepared game balls for previous Super Bowls in which the team participated. Mr. Brady was clear in his testimony before the Commissioner that both issues were discussed \u2014 the breaking story and the preparations for the Super Bowl, but the NFL\u2019s lawyer, in arguing in the federal appeals court, repeated the Commissioner\u2019s misstatement that Mr. Brady testified that he and Mr. Jastremski only discussed the Super Bowl (and therefore was not credible). None of the Brady-Jastremski texts even suggest that there had been a scheme of any kind to deflate footballs or to engage in a cover up of any such scheme. But when pressed by Judge Berman for the evidence against Brady, the increased texting was one of the only things to which the NFL\u2019s lawyers could point. \n \n Myth #13: Autographing a handful of items upon request, or including Mr. Jastremski on a list of over a dozen team staff members for holiday gifts, is evidence of Tom Brady\u2019s guilt. Mr. McNally, who supposedly carried out the deflation, never received anything from Mr. Brady except his autograph on three items Mr. McNally provided. Mr. Brady did not recall signing these items \u2014 not surprisingly, since he routinely is asked for, and provides, autographs, especially when the request is from someone in or around the team\u2019s locker room. Like Many NFL players, Mr. Brady not only routinely signs autographs but also recognizes team staff members at the holidays. Mr. Jastremski, was one of over a dozen team staff members that Tom Brady included on his holiday gift list at Christmas. There is no basis to conclude, as the NFL\u2019s lawyers have done, that there were any payments to induce or reward improper deflation of footballs. \n \n Myth #14: Tom Brady\u2019s decision not to retain his phone reflects his guilt. Before the interview of Mr. Brady, his lawyers were specifically advised, in an email from the NFL\u2019s lawyers, that Mr. Brady did not need to turn over his personal phone, and that a statement by his attorneys concerning messages on his phone was all that was needed. The February 28, 2014 email to Mr. Dubin, one of Mr. Brady\u2019s lawyers, from Mr. Burns of the Paul Weiss firm (and with copies to his colleagues Messrs. Wells and Reisner, as well as to Mr. Pash, the General Counsel of the League) was very explicit: \u201cWe are not seeking to take possession of his phone or to image its contents.\u201d Mr. Brady\u2019s counsel confirmed to Mr. Wells that the phone would not be turned over due to privacy and precedential concerns. \n \n The only reason that the phone became a focus at all was because the League was being challenged by the NFLPA, in Mr. Brady\u2019s appeal, on whether sanctions could be imposed on a player for supposed \u201cgeneral awareness\u201d of a rule violation by others. That was the most that the Wells Report was able to conclude about Mr. Brady after months of investigation. The League\u2019s lawyers realized that a sanction based on \u201cgeneral awareness\u201d was legally vulnerable, and that no player had ever been sanctioned for being \u201cgenerally aware\u201d that someone else had allegedly violated a rule. It was therefore important, if sanctions were to be maintained, that there be some evidence in the appeal hearing that Mr. Brady\u2019s involvement went beyond \u201cgeneral awareness.\u201d No such evidence came to light during the all-day hearing before the Commissioner. All the evidence, including Mr. Brady\u2019s sworn testimony, was to the contrary. There was simply no basis in the evidence that allowed the Commissioner to move from \u201cgeneral awareness\u201d to finding actual involvement. Mr. Brady\u2019s non-retention of his phone became the only available hook to do that. \n \n The League already had Mr. Jastremski\u2019s and Mr. McNally\u2019s uncensored texts, including all the texts between Mr. Jastremski and Mr. Brady (there were none between Mr. McNally and Mr. Brady). As part of his appeal, Mr. Brady actually provided the League with far more information about his texts than had been provided during the Wells investigation. The League could have gone to others with whom Mr. Brady texted (he provided a complete list) to ascertain the content of any other texts that they were curious about. Rather than investigate the list Mr. Brady provided, the League simply created the myth that the phone was \u201cdestroyed\u201d because it must have contained evidence of wrongdoing. This myth was so important to the League\u2019s spin on the story that it was the focus of the League\u2019s press release when the Commissioner\u2019s decision was issued. The League has escalated the importance of the phone even further, now equating Brady\u2019s non-retention of a phone it never asked for to a player masking the use of banned substances. This inflammatory reliance on the phone\u2019s non-retention reflects the League\u2019s realization that there is simply no evidence that implicates Mr. Brady in any deflation scheme. \n \n Myth #15: There was no action by any League officials that reflected any predisposition against the Patriots or warranted any criticism. It is an old adage: Never bite the hand that feeds you. The lawyers selected by the League to do an independent investigation had a long and deep relationship with the League. There were serious issues about League conduct and prejudgments \u2014 issues that warranted thorough investigation. But the NFL\u2019s lawyers never asked for a single text or email from any League or Game Official, and the Wells Report contains not a single criticism of any conduct by any League or Game Official. The list of acts and omissions which warranted serious investigation, if not critique, is remarkably long. It includes: (1) not advising the Patriots of the Colts\u2019 concerns about PSI expressed the day before the game or taking other steps pre-game in order to help ensure there were no issues in the upcoming championship game ; (2) not keeping control of the footballs pre-game as the Referee is required to do by Rule 2; (3) despite the expressed pre-game concerns about PSI, not recording the pre-game PSI of game footballs (or the gauge used); (4) during the game, not bringing the Colts\u2019 concerns about the intercepted football immediately to the attention of the Referee, who, under the rules, has sole responsibility to determine if footballs comply with the rules; (5) allowing the rest of the first half to be played with what were then presumed to be under-inflated footballs; (6) excluding the Referee from the halftime gauging and re-inflating despite these matters being the sole responsibility of the Referee under Rule 2; (7) despite Rule 2 having been in place for decades, having no understanding that PSI is affected by temperature changes and weather; (8) rushing to judgment, including accusing the Patriots of cheating in the second half of the AFC Championship Game and making a \u201cpreliminary finding\u201d of tampering with the footballs the day after the game, despite the total lack of understanding of the Ideal Gas Law; (9) providing incorrect information to the Patriots about the PSI of both Patriots footballs and the Colts footballs in the formal League letter; (10) leaking incorrect PSI information to the press (ESPN has confirmed that the false information came from sources within the NFL); and (11) refusing to correct the false PSI information for months, despite seeing the media and public reactions, and the harm to the Patriots, caused by that false information. \n \n CONCLUSION \n \n This situation would have been brought to a quick close if the League had even a general awareness of the scientific impact of temperature and weather conditions on the PSI of footballs at the time of the AFC Championship Game. Prompt correction of misinformation leaked by the League would have allowed knowledgeable and objective people to assess the numbers and minimize the media frenzy and public furor. For reasons still unknown, the League and its lawyers refused to release the accurate information for months, doing so only in the context of a report which based its conclusions primarily on dubious interpretations of ambiguous texts. The Wells Report is written more as a piece of advocacy trying to support its predetermined conclusions than as an independent and dispassionate review of all the facts. The League\u2019s lawyers have refused to produce their interview notes, their communications with Exponent, or the extent of the edits by the League\u2019s General Counsel to drafts of the Wells Report. The League has also refused to provide the PSI data it collected during the 2015 \u201crandom spot checks.\u201d If properly performed, those checks undoubtedly confirm that numerous games are played with below-regulation footballs due to the impact of weather conditions on footballs. The integrity of the League is of vital importance. One can only wonder if it has been seriously compromised by the League\u2019s lack of transparency and what appears to be an ongoing effort to defend, rather than critically assess, the dubious conclusions and methodology of the Wells and Exponent Reports. \n \n D.L.G. ||||| FILE - In a Thursday, May 7, 2015 file photo, New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady gestures during an event at Salem State University in Salem, Mass. The NFL suspended Brady for the first four games... (Associated Press) \n \n FOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) \u2014 Tom Brady has appealed his four-game suspension for his role in using deflated footballs during the AFC championship game. \n \n The expected appeal was filed Thursday ahead of a 5 p.m. deadline. \n \n The NFL announced the quarterback's suspension on Monday, also fining the New England Patriots $1 million and taking away two draft picks. \n \n Brady's appeal only deals with the suspension and must be heard within 10 days. The team has not said if it will appeal its penalties before a Thursday deadline. \n \n League-appointed investigator Ted Wells found that Brady was \"at least generally aware\" of plans by two team employees to prepare the balls to his liking, below the league-mandated minimum of 12.5 pounds per square inch. \n \n ___ \n \n AP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Tom Brady appealed his four-game suspension over under-inflated footballs with about an hour to spare before today's 5pm deadline, reports AP. The NFL Players Association filed the paperwork on his behalf. The Patriots, meanwhile, issued a detailed rebuttal to the league report on the scandal, saying its conclusions are \"at best, incomplete, incorrect and lack context.\" One notable part: Referring to texts between team employees Jim McNally and John Jastremski, the Patriots say there's no proof they were talking about deflating footballs, reports the Boston Globe. Instead, McNally's \"deflator\" nickname referred to weight loss, says the team: \"Mr. Jastremski would sometimes work out and bulk up\u2014he is a slender guy and his goal was to get to 200 pounds. Mr. McNally is a big fellow and had the opposite goal: to lose weight. 'Deflate' was a term they used to refer to losing weight.\"",

The team has set up wellsreportcontext.com, though it didn't explain why equipment assistant John Jastremski was suspended or why team attendant Jim McNally was suspended for texting with Jastremski that he \"deflates and give somebody that jacket.\" The 20,000-word rebuttal includes a Nobel laureate's rejection of the report's scientific evidence and a stunning claim that team attendant Jim McNally referred to himself as \"the deflator\" because he was losing weight\u2014not because he was removing air pressure from Brady's footballs. \"The conclusions of the Wells Report are, at best, incomplete, incorrect, and lack context,\" says the rebuttal, written by Patriots lawyer Daniel L. Goldberg. \"Mr. McNally is a big fellow and had the opposite goal: to lose weight. 'Deflate' was a term they used to refer to losing weight.'' Goldberg says no evidence has surfaced of Brady saying he prefers his footballs deflated below the league's minimum pressure standard of 12.5 pounds per square inch. He says six phone calls between Brady and Jastremski over three days are \"totally consistent with complete innocence.\"",

    "document": "Reuters \n \n Yikes. Rafe Esquith\u2014perhaps the most decorated elementary-school teacher in the country, the only K-12 educator ever to receive the National Medal of the Arts\u2014has been accused of sexual misconduct in shocking documents released Tuesday by Los Angeles Unified School District. \n \n Until he was removed from the classroom this spring, Esquith, 61, had taught fifth grade at Hobart Elementary School, a high-poverty school in Los Angeles with an overwhelming percentage of English-language learners, for more than 30 years. Esquith\u2019s \u201cHobart Shakespeareans\u201d nonprofit, which puts on a Shakespeare production every year in his classroom, became world-renowned, the subject of a PBS documentary, and a resplendent example of the miracles that committed public educators can work even in challenging school environments. When he wasn\u2019t transforming young lives, Esquith was writing inspirational books and accepting lots of awards: In addition to the National Medal of the Arts, his prizes include Oprah Winfrey\u2019s Use Your Life Award, Disney\u2019s National Outstanding Teacher of the Year award, and even Dalai Lama\u2019s Compassion in Action Award. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n And now for the it-was-all-too-good-to-be-true part: According to the Los Angeles Times, this spring, one teacher reported that Esquith had made an inappropriate joke about Mark Twain\u2019s The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, saying that if he couldn\u2019t raise enough cash to fund the annual production, the class would have to perform naked. Then there was: \n \n an incident from March 2015 in which Esquith told a student who had completed his work that he could \u201csurf the net for porn. That\u2019s what we do in our spare time.\u201d\u2026 Esquith told a student who would appear in an upcoming play that \u201cif the audience doesn\u2019t like his performance, he can perform while nude, or at least wear a fig leaf. And, from what I\u2019ve heard, it would be a small fig leaf.\u201d \n \n These claims kicked off Los Angeles Unified\u2019s investigation into Esquith, who was removed from the classroom pending its findings. In October, he was fired, a move greeted with outrage all over the country. In the Washington Post, education columnist Jay Mathews, who had named Esquith \u201cAmerica\u2019s Best Classroom Teacher\u201d in 2007, wrote that:* \n \n He has been dismissed for murky reasons that appear to be part of a witch hunt against hundreds of other L.A. educators \u2026 the result of L.A. school leaders losing touch with reality after being traumatized by a molestation scandal a few years ago. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n But now, with the 66-page document dump, those reasons no longer seem so murky. \n \n While Esquith has not been charged with a crime (though the documents do allege that, even before he became a teacher, Esquith fondled several children in the 1970s), he comes across as a desperate, preening, pathetic predator: the last person you want near your kids. He\u2019s accused of spanking, fondling, and tickling female students; making grossly inappropriate comments (saying, for example, that one student \u201cloved green M&M\u2019s because they made her horny\u201d); and screening movies with sexually inappropriate content to fifth-graders after school. \n \n And then there were the emails. Lots and lots of legitimately grotesque emails, addressed to students who were at most 14 years old, that lay bare the consummate creepiness: He addressed one student as \u201cSupermodel\u201d and signed off to another as \u201cYour Favorite ATM.\u201d The Wednesday Washington Post story about the allegations uses one of his lines as its headline: \u201cHow is my favorite Hottie?\u201d And this, from the Los Angeles Times: \n \n In one 2013 email, Esquith praised a former student, who was 14 years old, saying she was \u201cBeautiful. Elegant. Dazzling. Sexy. Gorgeous.\u201d And in the same conversation writes \u201cdon\u2019t argue, hottie.\u201d He later writes to her, \u201cyou\u2019re soooooooooooooooo fine.\u201d \n \n The conversations include one in which the girl thanks him for giving her lunch money and \u201cfor the hundreds and hundreds\u201d he\u2019s given her. \n \n Captain Inappropriate wrote another girl, \u201cYou will do WELL wherever you go because you\u2019re great, but I want you to be happy and have lots of guys and beer and drugs and all the things that make high school great!\u201d \n \n Before the documents became public, Esquith\u2019s lawyer accused the school district of constructing a \u201cfraudulent narrative\u201d as part of its \u201clatest effort to smear.\u201d In October, Esquith filed a $1 billion class-action lawsuit on behalf of approximately 2,000 LAUSD teachers who were removed from the classroom for no clear reason\u2014part of an age-discrimination scheme, the suit alleged, to place pressure on teachers approaching retirement age to resign without the full pension and benefits they\u2019d earned.

In turn, the restaurant posted a photo on Facebook of Sessions standing with chef-owner Domenic Laurenzo and a caption that read as follows: \n \n \"We had the honor to server [sic] Mr. Jeff Sessions, Attorney General of the United States. Thank you for allowing us to serve you.\" \n \n Sessions' key role in the Trump administration's immigration policies, including increased deportation and the practice of separating parents and children who attempt to cross the border illegally, has made him a controversial figure. \n \n People immediately called for a boycott of any restaurant that considered serving him \"an honor,\" and the original post was quickly deleted. In its place, the restaurant posted the following statement from owner Roland Laurenzo: \n \n El Tiempo does not in anyway support the practice of separating children from parents or any other practices of the government relative to immigration. The posting of a photograph of the Attorney General at one of our restaurants does not represent us supporting his positions. The secret service contacted us that a government official was coming to dinner at our establishment and his identity was not know until he walked through the door.

It was posted without review or approval by ownership and this has lead to everyone jumping to conclusions that somehow we are involved in this political matter. We don\u2019t approve of anyone separating parents and children. \n \n Of course, that did little to stem the criticism, except that it now included Trump administration supporters who disagreed with the restaurant's new statement and Trump administration opponents who asserted the damage had already been done. Others suggested that a restaurant should always feel honored to serve a senior government official regardless of whether the restaurant's staff agrees or disagrees with the person's policies and that El Tiempo had done nothing wrong by thanking the Attorney General for his visit. \n \n How restaurants should treat Trump administration officials has been a hot topic since June, when Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders reported that she has been asked to leave The Red Hen in Lexington, Virginia. Danny Meyer, the legendary New York restaurateur and founder of Shake Shack, told CBS This Morning that refusing service based on someone's beliefs constituted a slippery slope. \n \n \"The minute you see me checking people's political registration at the door, that's a bad future, I think, for our business,\" Meyer said. \n \n Curiously, El Tiempo isn't the only Tex-Mex restaurant that Sessions dined at during his visit. He ate breakfast at La Mexicana, the popular Montrose Tex-Mex restaurant. Unlike El Tiempo, La Mexicana did not promote that Sessions had visited; rather, a reddit user spotted his security detail standing guard in front of the restaurant. \n \n Zulema Gonzales, La Mexicana's general manager, confirmed the visit to the Houston Chronicle. She said that Sessions seemed unsure about what to order and settled on huevos rancheros at the suggestion of Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo, who also attended the breakfast. \n \n \"We treat everybody the same,\" Gonzales told the newspaper. ||||| HOUSTON \u2014 A Houston culinary dynasty has come under fire after a photo with U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions began circulating online. \n \n Sessions is pictured with El Tiempo restaurant co-owner Dominic Laurenzo during a recent visit to Houston. \n \n Sessions' tough stance on immigration, coupled with the perceived endorsement by the Tex-Mex restaurant, has resulted in a hailstorm of complaints and even death threats. \n \n Laurenzo's Restaurants president Roland Laurenzo says in no way does the social media post equate to an endorsement of Sessions' politics. He says the company feels quite the opposite. \n \n Laurenzo says the photo was taken with his son Dominic at the El Tiempo restaurant on Navigation Boulevard after Sessions finished his dinner. \n \n He says they discussed fajitas and Sessions was treated like any other guest -- with kindness and hospitality. \n \n It wasn\u2019t until later, when the photo was passed on to the company\u2019s social media manager, that things took off. \n \n Laurenzo says she wrote the caption on the post. \n \n \u201cIn retrospect, it was a mistake because it angered so many people,\" Laurenzo said. \"We have gotten so many complaints and comments.

She gave people hugs, patted babies on the head, munched on a grease-dripping pork chop and waved to cheering crowds on balconies as they called out her name. \n \n It\u2019s a world of difference from Clinton\u2019s last White House bid, when she was criticized here for seeming too-cool-for-school to mingle with what she now calls \u2018everyday Americans.\u2019 Given Iowa\u2019s traditional early-state role in presidential elections, its residents are accustomed to, and expect, face-to-face interaction with political candidates \u2014 never Clinton\u2019s forte. \n \n But during a two-day sweep through the Hawkeye State this weekend, Clinton is showing she\u2019s learned her lesson \u2014 and that she\u2019s really trying to put that problem behind her. \n \n For starters, there were no rope lines keeping people out. During a July 4 parade in New Hampshire just a few weeks ago, Clinton separated herself off from reporters and others with a moving corral \u2014 which played terribly in the headlines and reinforced the image of a standoff contender who didn\u2019t want to interact. \n \n But at the fair, crowds totally swarmed her and her escort, former Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), who just endorsed Clinton this week. The scrum following Clinton was so densely packed that followers at times had to take one-inch baby steps to move, bumping shoulders with people next to them \u2014 if they could move at all. \n \n Few in the press could even get to her as she walked through a barn, and was promptly surrounded, to marveled at Iowa\u2019s world-famous Butter Cow, a massive bovine statue made of pure cholesterol. \n \n When people realized who was in the building, they pushed toward the cameras and flying boom microphones \u2014 so much that Clinton\u2019s omnipresent security detail, which wore plaid shirts to blend in with the crowd, had to hold some back because they couldn\u2019t keep eyes on everyone. With temperatures outside in the high 80s, the place was like a sauna. \n \n People encircled balconies in the barn to get a glimpse of her, yelling \u201clook here, Hillary!\u201d or \u201cHillary, I love you!\u201d And those on the ground who couldn\u2019t see her because of all the bodies held up their phones, angling them such that they could snap a memento. \n \n \u201cI got a video,\u201d one kid bragged to someone standing next to him. A Secret Service officer joked to POLITICO that he hadn\u2019t even seen Clinton once since her arrival at the fair because of the thick crowd surrounding her. \n \n Clinton supporter Dan Fredericks of Boone, who went up to praise Clinton in peron at the fair for her education policy, said he\u2019s seen a real difference in her this year. \n \n \u201cShe\u2019s doing it. Right here,\u201d he said, pointing down at the ground. \u201cLast time she was kinda up, and Barack Obama was down with the crowds. Now, it\u2019s giving me goosebumps \u2026 She\u2019s having a good weekend.\u201d \n \n There was one notable stop Clinton didn\u2019t make at the fair: the soapbox. Politicians, including GOP candidate Jeb Bush just a day earlier, will often jump up on the stage to take questions from Iowans. And on Saturday, just hours after Clinton left, her most threatening Democratic challenger Bernie Sanders got up there to rail against corporate American greed. \n \n The crowd that surrounded Sanders during his soapbox speech was even larger than the one that followed Hillary, and the fact that Clinton wasn\u2019t up there, too, prompted some criticism. \n \n \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she get on the soapbox to talk?\u201d asked an irked Leslie Johnson of Waukee, who had just heard Sanders\u2019s soapbox speech. She didn\u2019t even know Clinton was at the fair. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she do that? \u2026 And I remember all this [when I vote]. I don\u2019t forget.\u201d \n \n Sanders, however, did not take questions from the public as candidates on the box usually do \u2014 and his day at the fair was brief as he rushed passed Iowans in a hurried brisk walk, cameramen pushing and jabbing annoyed bystanders out of the way. \n \n Clinton, by contrast, took her time, spending about an hour and a half at the fair as she inched along and people approached. A 30-something Iowan mother named April Stumpf asked her to support legalizing medicinal marijuana nationally. Stumpf\u2019s three-year-old daughter, Quinn, has a severe case of epilepsy and is about to die, she explained to Clinton. Her doctors recommend medical marijuana to ease the pain, but it\u2019s hard to get because it\u2019s illegal to sell in Iowa. The state allows residents to get medical marijuana cards and purchase the drug out of state \u2014 but often states that sell it require patients to be present for purchase, and Quinn is too sick to travel. \n \n \u201cShe\u2019s not expected to live past \u2026 \u201d her voice trailed off. \u201cI mean, she can go at any time.\u201d \n \n Clinton agreed that there should be more research on the subject. And when Stumpf walked away, she dispatched her aides to get her contact information as the crowd continued onward. \n \n Before meeting the public, Clinton and Harkin gaggled with reporters behind a small, muddied pasture for livestock toward the edge of the fair. Before the press conference they chatted with a young boy behind the pasture fence who was holding a cow on a leash. \n \n Then Harkin praised Clinton for her public service. \n \n \u201cI saw Clinton behind the cameras\u201d on Capitol Hill, Harkin said. \u201cShe\u2019s always fighting for those kids, those families \u2026 for early childhood education \u2026 to ensure pay equity for women.\u201d \n \n Multiple reporters pressed Clinton on the email scandal dogging her back in Washington D.C. She pushed back, reiterating that she used her private account for convenience and vowing that she \u201cnever sent any classified material or received any marked classified.\u201d She belittled the issue. \n \n \u201cIt isn\u2019t anything people talk to me about,\u201d she said. \u201cThey never raise it in my town halls.\u201d \n \n During her visit she ran into a number of people she seemed to know, suggesting a little pre-planning on the part of the campaign. She dished about horse racing with one woman related to a longtime Iowa-based Clinton supporter. Then, there was prominent Iowa real estate developer Bill Knapp, and the sister of a former colleague of Clinton\u2019s at the University of Arkansas law school. \n \n She seemed to have fun. Clinton and her top aide Huma Abedin joked about a straw hat Harkin wore. And Clinton raved on and on about being a grandmother to another fair-goer. \n \n \u201cBill and I are crazy [about our granddaughter]. We are just crazy. I am way over the top.\u201d \n \n By the time she jumped back into the black SUV that whisked her away, Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs had counted 42 pictures that Clinton posed for with fans \u2014 many of those were selfies. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m your biggest fan,\u201d said one sweaty gentleman who jumped to the head of the crowd and draped his arm around her for a photo. \n \n Clinton smiled for the camera. ||||| Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n WASHINGTON \u2014 F.B.I. agents investigating Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s private email server are seeking to determine who at the State Department passed highly classified information from secure networks to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s personal account, according to law enforcement and diplomatic officials and others briefed on the investigation. \n \n To track how the information flowed, agents will try to gain access to the email accounts of many State Department officials who worked there while Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state, the officials said. State Department employees apparently circulated the emails on unclassified systems in 2009 and 2011, and some were ultimately forwarded to Mrs. Clinton. \n \n They were not marked as classified, the State Department has said, and it is unclear whether its employees knew the origin of the information. \n \n The F.B.I. is also trying to determine whether foreign powers, especially China or Russia, gained access to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s private server, although at this point, any security breaches are speculation. \n \n Law enforcement officials have said that Mrs. Clinton, who is seeking the 2016 Democratic nomination for president, is not a target of the investigation, and she has said there is no evidence that her account was hacked. There has also been no evidence that she broke the law, and many specialists believe the occasional appearance of classified information in her account was probably of marginal consequence. \n \n A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton said in a statement on Friday that she \u201ctook the handling of classified information very seriously.\u201d \n \n \u201cShe always received classified materials in secure settings, either by phone, videoconference, on paper or in person,\u201d said the spokesman, Nick Merrill. \u201cIf, however, some material unknowingly ended up somewhere on the State Department\u2019s unclassified email system, we want to continue to be as helpful as possible in getting to the bottom of that.\u201d \n \n He added: \u201cBeyond that, we\u2019ll let the State Department and other agencies speak to the specifics.\u201d \n \n This week, the inspector general of the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies, I. Charles McCullough III, informed members of Congress that Mrs. Clinton had \u201ctop secret\u201d information, the highest classification of government intelligence, in her account. \n \n Some of that information, according to a memorandum the inspector general sent to the heads of the Senate and House intelligence and judiciary committees, may have come from a program called Talent Keyhole, which relies on satellite intercepts of conversations or imagery data. The program involves some of the most secure information in the intelligence agencies\u2019 computer systems. \n \n Specifically, the inspector general told members of Congress that two emails should have been classified as top secret, with one of them designated \u201cTOP SECRET//SI//TK/NOFORN.\u201d Officials familiar with the nomenclature said that \u201cSI\u201d stood for \u201cspecial intelligence,\u201d usually indicating an intercepted communication, and that \u201cTK\u201d was routinely used as an abbreviation for Talent Keyhole, showing that the communication or an image was obtained from a satellite. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Attached to the memo \u2014 which was publicly released by Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee \u2014 were copies of two of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails that Mr. McCullough said contained classified information. Those emails were not released publicly. \n \n The State Department has questioned whether the determination by Mr. McCullough is correct. Nevertheless, the findings are consistent with the view of some federal officials that the State Department is not rigorous enough in handling classified national security information. \n \n In an unusual move, the F.B.I.\u2019s inquiry is being led out of its headquarters in Washington, blocks from the White House. Nearly all investigations are assigned to one of the bureau\u2019s 56 field offices. But given this inquiry\u2019s importance, senior F.B.I. officials have opted to keep it closely held in Washington in the agency\u2019s counterintelligence section, which investigates how national security secrets are handled. \n \n The investigation into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails has its roots in her decision to use only a private email account for her official business when she was secretary of state, an unorthodox decision that gave her some control over what was made public. She faced criticism when her use of the account became known this year, and after deleting what she said were more than 31,000 personal emails, she turned over more than 30,000 work-related emails for the State Department to make public. \n \n Mrs. Clinton has said that her emails contained no classified information \u2014 having classified information outside a secure government account is illegal \u2014 and that she is fully cooperating with the investigation. But in reviewing a sampling of the emails for potential security breaches, Mr. McCullough said he found four out of 40 that contained classified information, though perhaps stripped of any indication that it was of classified origin. \n \n According to current and former State Department officials who worked with Mrs. Clinton, most classified information was routed to classified government servers in her office, where it was printed out for her review. Her predecessor, Condoleezza Rice, often operated the same way. \n \n Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement Thursday in response to what she said were \u201callegations about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails\u201d that \u201cnone of the emails alleged to contain classified information were written by Secretary Clinton\u201d and that \u201cnone of the emails alleged to contain classified information include any markings that indicate classified content.\u201d \n \n In a letter made public on Wednesday, David Kendall, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s lawyer, said he had handed over to the Justice Department a thumb drive containing the 30,000 emails that had been given to the State Department. He also said the company that had handled Mrs. Clinton\u2019s personal account had given the Justice Department the server Mrs. Clinton used to operate it. The company, Platte River Networks, had been in possession of the server since 2013. \n \n Computer experts said it was likely that F.B.I. technicians would be able to recover from the server at least some of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s deleted personal emails. \n \n In addition, specially trained cybersecurity investigators will seek to determine whether Russian, Chinese or other hackers breached the account or tried to transfer any of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails, including those containing the classified information, several officials said. \n \n Mrs. Clinton\u2019s successor, Secretary of State John Kerry, told CBS News this week that \u201cit is very likely\u201d that Russian or Chinese hackers read his emails, although he did not specify whether he was talking about his classified or unclassified accounts. \u201cI certainly write things with that awareness,\u201d he said.",

It's also a notable departure from her appearance in Iowa in 2008, when she didn't want to mingle with the commonfolk, writes Rachel Bade. Clinton also made headlines this weekend for joking about her email controversy, notes NBC News. \"You may have seen that I recently launched a Snapchat account,\" she said at a dinner last night. \"I love it. I love it. Those messages disappear all by themselves.\" Today, reporters grilled her anew about the controversy, including whether her joke suggested she was taking it too lightly. \"We'll see how this all plays out, but it's not something the people raise with me as I travel around the country,\" said Clinton, again reiterating that she never sent or received email marked as classified. The \"marked as classified\" is an important distinction: It turns out that some emails were indeed considered top secret, though it's unclear whether that designation came about after the emails were sent or whether State Department officials were careless. To help figure it out, the FBI will try to gain access to the accounts of State Department officials who were there during Clinton's tenure, reports the New York Times.",

However, the 77-page report submitted by a Philippine lawyer, Jude Sabio, alleged the death toll was over 8,000. \n \n The ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said in a statement that her office would \u201canalyse crimes allegedly committed \u2026 since at least 1 July 2016 in the context of the \u2018war on drugs\u2019 campaign\u201d. The inquiry will be the ICC\u2019s first preliminary examination in a south-east Asian nation. \n \n Gary Alejano, an opposition politician who tried to get Duterte impeached last year and submitted evidence to the ICC as part of the complaint, said the move was an affirmation that the claims against Duterte had legitimacy, and it offered \u201ca ray of hope for the victims of his war on drugs, which is still ongoing right now\u201d. \n \n \n \n He said: \u201cIn this country, people are at a loss where to go if members of your family feel victim to the war on drugs. They cannot go to police because they are involved, they cannot go to the department of justice because the secretary will say there\u2019s no such thing as extrajudicial killing. And when we request an investigation from the House of Representatives, we can not get an impartial hearing because they are covering up for the president. There is a clear and blatant violation of the rule of law in the Philippines right now, and so the ICC are the only ones who can step in.\u201d \n \n Alejano said he believed they had a \u201cstrong case, if we are given the opportunity to be heard.\u201d \n \n Duterte\u2019s spokesperson, Harry Roque, described the inquiry as a \u201cwaste of the court\u2019s time and resources,\u201d stressing that many of the allegations predated the Philippines signing up to the ICC in 2011, and therefore could not be considered. However, Bensouda specifically referenced killings since 1 July 2016 in her statement. \n \n Roque said continuing with the investigation would undermine the sovereignty of the Philippines \u201cbecause the domestic courts are functioning and willing to entertain this matter \u2026 and the alleged deaths, if true, were because of a legitimate police exercise.\u201d \n \n He alleged that \u201cdomestic enemies\u201d were behind the complaint and said Duterte was prepared to go on trial and defend his actions, though he said he was confident the ICC would not proceed. \u201cHe\u2019s sick and tried of being accused. He wants to be in court and put the prosecutor on the stand,\u201d Roque said. \n \n Since securing a landslide victory in the 2016 elections on a pledge to kill tens of thousands of criminals and eradicate drugs in Philippine society, Duterte has authorised police to violently crack down on illegal drug use, urging them to kill suspects and promising to protect them from prosecution. His abrasive tongue and brutal methods have kept him popular in the Philippines, where he enjoys high approval ratings and legislative support. \n \n He maintains that the thousands who died were suspects who resisted arrest, but human rights groups and political opponents allege that many murders have been carried out and covered up. \n \n When he was mayor of Davao, Duterte\u2019s crackdown on criminals was often carried out by vigilante groups, known as death squads, allegedly with his approval.

    "document": "Stock Chart for Orexigen Therapeutics Inc (OREX) \n \n Orexigen Therapeutics Inc.\u2019s success in winning the first U.S. panel recommendation for a long-sought prescription diet pill led its shares to almost double and shows the company benefited from its rivals\u2019 earlier difficulties. \n \n Outside advisers to the Food and Drug Administration said weight-loss benefits of Orexigen\u2019s product, Contrave, exceed the dangers of elevated pulse and blood pressure and that a large study on cardiovascular risk can wait until after the drug is approved. The FDA delayed competing treatments from Arena Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Vivus Inc. in October after they failed to win panel backing on safety. \n \n \u201cThe fact that they were able to convince the panel not only that the cardiovascular study can wait, but that the drug can be approved, is exciting, particularly after we saw the other obesity drugs voted down,\u201d Joshua Schimmer, a Leerink Swann analyst, said yesterday in a telephone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know to what extent their strategy was altered by the first two, but it sure as heck didn\u2019t hurt.\u201d \n \n While the FDA isn\u2019t obliged to follow recommendations of advisers, their support eases concern that had caused Orexigen shares to drop more than a third this year. The La Jolla, California-based company gained from watching the FDA\u2019s safety focus and saw that a commitment to minimize risks and conduct more studies would be needed for approval, Schimmer said. \n \n Stocks Surge \n \n Orexigen rose $4.01, or 84 percent, to $8.77 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading, the most in a single day since the shares began trading in April 2007. Options traders placed record bets on Orexigen last week, saying a positive panel vote would double the company\u2019s value. Vivus shares gained $1.20, or 15 percent, to $9 as analysts said the Orexigen recommendation suggests the long-term heart risks with Vivus\u2019s drug, Qnexa, won\u2019t need to be studied before approval. Arena jumped 16 cents, or 11 percent, to $1.57. \n \n About 68 percent of American adults are overweight, raising their risk of diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and cancer, according to the 2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Almost 34 percent are obese, measured as a ratio between height and weight. \n \n The three companies and their partners have been in a race to introduce the first prescription weight-loss pill in more than a decade. Basel, Switzerland-based Roche Holding AG\u2019s Xenical, approved in 1999, is the only long-term medicine for weight loss since Abbott Park, Illinois-based Abbott Laboratories\u2019 Meridia was pulled off the market in October because of heart risks. \n \n January Deadline \n \n Orexigen and partner Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., of Osaka, Japan, are scheduled to receive a decision from the FDA by Jan. 31. Schimmer said approval may be delayed while the company and the agency work out details of the prescribing information and the new study. He expects Contrave and Qnexa ultimately to win approval with potential sales of each reaching $1 billion or more in the U.S. \n \n \u201cWe learned about the complex issues surrounding obesity therapeutics that are important to the FDA and the medical community, and we did our best to address those issues,\u201d Orexigen Chief Executive Officer Michael Narachi said yesterday after the vote. \n \n Vivus, based in Mountain View, California, said Oct. 29 that it plans to respond within six weeks to the FDA\u2019s request for more information about heart risks and birth defects linked to Qnexa. This would trigger a new two- to six-month review. \n \n \u201cVivus is encouraged by Tuesday\u2019s advisory committee meeting because it provides hope for patients that new medical treatments for obesity are seriously being considered by the FDA,\u201d the company said today in an e-mail. \n \n Arena\u2019s Lorcaserin \n \n San Diego-based Arena said Oct. 25 that the FDA had questions about tumors seen in studies of rats taking the diet drug lorcaserin, which Arena is developing with Eisai Co. of Tokyo. The companies will meet with the agency later this month. \n \n \u201cArena is pleased to see the recognition of the need for obesity medications,\u201d the company said in an e-mail today. \u201cAt this time, the company is focused on obtaining FDA approval of lorcaserin as quickly as possible.\u201d \n \n Contrave, Orexigen\u2019s first product, is a combination of two approved drugs that target different parts of the brain that influence appetite and cravings. The pill contains bupropion, an antidepressant also used to quit smoking, and naltrexone, a treatment for alcohol and painkiller addiction. \n \n Study Results \n \n Two tablets of Contrave twice a day helped twice as many patients in studies lose at least 5 percent of their weight compared with a placebo after 56 weeks. The drug missed the FDA\u2019s second standard of effectiveness in failing to show at least a 5 percent benefit over placebo. Patients on the drug also had higher pulse and blood pressure than patients on placebo, even after losing weight. \n \n Dissident members of the advisory panel said Contrave shouldn\u2019t be approved without a large study of heart risks because it counteracts some of the expected benefits of weight loss, a signal that it may have long-term complications. \n \n \u201cThis drug resembles sibutramine,\u201d said panel member Sanjay Kaul, using the chemical name for Meridia. \u201cThere is an opportunity for us to learn from history or else we\u2019re going to repeat it. We need to make sure we get it right this time.\u201d \n \n Kaul is the director of fellowship training in cardiovascular diseases at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. \n \n To contact the reporter on this story: Catherine Larkin in Washington at clarkin4@bloomberg.net. \n \n To contact the editor responsible for this story: Reg Gale at rgale5@bloomberg.net. ||||| SILVER SPRING, Md. -- An FDA advisory committee has voted 13-7 that the modest weight-loss benefits of an investigational combination of naltrexone and bupropion (Contrave) outweigh the drug's blood pressure risk. \n \n The bupropion naltrexone combo is the last in a trio of new weight-loss drugs that went before FDA panels this year, striving to be the latest treatment in the dwindling field of medications to fight obesity. The previous two drugs, phentermine/topiramate (Qnexa) and lorcaserin hydrochloride (Lorqess) were both rejected by the FDA after they fared poorly at advisory committee meetings. \n \n But Tuesday's advisory committee ended very differently than the previous two. \n \n Bupropion/naltrexone appeared to offer fewer side effects than the previous two drugs, although it also doesn't appear to work as well at helping obese patients lose weight. \n \n The FDA will make an approval decision by Jan. 31. The agency does not have to follow the advice of its advisory committees, but it often does. \n \n Orexigen, the company that makes naltrexone/bupropion in partnership with Takeda, is seeking approval for treatment of obesity and weight management in patients with a body mass index of 30 or above, or 27 or above and with one or more risk factors (e.g., diabetes, dyslipidemia, or hypertension). \n \n Contrave combines an antidepressant and an anti-addiction drug, both of which have been used individually for 20 years -- naltrexone for opioid addiction and alcohol dependence and bupropion for depression and smoking cessation. However, little is known about combining the drugs for weight managment. \n \n The Endocrine and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee reviewed results from Orexigen's four placebo-controlled, one-year, phase III clinical trials, which enrolled 3,200 obese patients with at least one comorbid condition, including diabetes and depression. \n \n In all four trials, patients on the naltrexone/bupropion combination lost more weight than those in the placebo group (P<0.001), and more than 30% lost at least 5% of their body weight, which is one standard by which the FDA judges efficacy of weight-loss drugs. \n \n In a pooled analysis, naltrexone/bupropion patients lost an average of 4.2% more weight than the placebo group (ranging from 3.3% to 4.8%). That falls short of the other FDA standard that after one year, the difference in mean weight loss between the active and control groups should be at least 5%. \n \n In one trial where patients taking naltrexone/bupropion were compared with those undergoing a lifestyle modification program, the difference between the groups was even smaller, suggesting that diet and exercise can achieve similar results as naltrexone/bupropion. \n \n \"As far as efficacy goes, I think they made it by the hair of their chinny chin chin,\" said Melanie Coffin, the panel's patient representative. \n \n In the FDA's assessment of the drug released last week, reviewers expressed concerns over several side effects -- a potential increased risk for dizziness, nausea, seizures, and high blood pressure among patients taking naltrexone/bupropion. \n \n However, the panel was mostly just concerned with one side effect: The drug's effect on blood pressure. \n \n In the trials, patients taking naltrexone/bupropion were more likely to have an increase in blood pressure and heart rate than placebo patients, an effect that was most pronounced during the first eight weeks of treatment. \n \n However, patients taking naltrexone/bupropion who lost at least 5% of their body weight achieved lower blood pressure and heart rate compared with those who lost less weight. But the most impressive improvements in blood pressure and weight loss were seen among patients taking placebo who achieved more than a 5% weight loss, suggesting diet and exercise is the best option for obese patients to lower their blood pressure. \n \n Panelists were concerned that a drug that is supposed to reduce obesity -- and hopefully other comorbidities along with it -- actually raised blood pressure instead. \n \n \"This is my biggest concern,\" said Lamont Weide, MD, PhD, chief of diabetes and endocrinology at Truman Medical Centers Diabetes Center in Kansas City, Mo. \"That we are blunting all the good effects that we should see with weight loss.\" \n \n The FDA reviewers concluded there wasn't enough data on the cardiovascular risks of the drug. The panel seemed to agree, but voted 11-8, with two panelists abstaining, that the company could submit new data after approval to show that the drug doesn't present major heart risks. \n \n The panel's one neurologist, Michael Rogawski, MD, PhD, said he thought the panel downplayed the drug's seizure risk. \n \n Two patients in the clinical trials experienced seizures after going on naltrexone/bupropion; no participants in the placebo group had seizures. About one in 1,000 patients who take the drug would be expected to have a seizure, the panelists said. \n \n \"They occur only in one out of 1,000, but still, the consequences of having a seizure could be catastrophic,\" said Rogawski, who ended up voting in favor of the drug. \n \n There is currently just one anti-obesity drug on the market: Orlistat (Xenical, Alli), after Abbott, the maker of another drug sibutramine (Meridia) voluntarily agreed to remove it from the U.S. market in October because of increased risk of stroke and MI. \n \n Several physicians and other healthcare professionals contacted by MedPage Today/ABC News were pleased with the panel's decision and said that doctors badly need a new drug to help patients battle obesity. \n \n \"It is nice to have a medication that can help those who are watching their diet and boosting activity lose the weight that thus far has been a slow process,\" said dietitian Connie Diekman, director of University Nutrition at Washington University in St Louis. \"This is one more option in the tool chest to deal with the obesity issue.\" \n \n \"Finally!\" said Robert F. Kushner, MD, professor of Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. \"I fully endorse the panel's vote. The key will be to educate physicians on how to best prescribe the medication -- identify patients who will benefit from the medication and to accompany it with lifestyle and behavioral recommendations.\" \n \n Paul L. Doering, a pharmacy professor at the University of Florida, said he doesn't \"doubt for a minute that this drug will be wildly successful, at least at first,\" adding, \"Time will ultimately tell if it is a good drug or not. In the meantime, I'm going to let somebody else be the first to take it.\" \n \n This article was developed in collaboration with ABC News.",

    "document": "ELK RIVER, Minn. \u2014 The verdict from Washington last week was swift and bipartisan: Michele Bachmann was out of line. \n \n Accusing two prominent Muslims \u2014 State Department aide Huma Abedin and Democratic Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota \u2014 of being tied to the Muslim Brotherhood was a step too far, even for the conservative firebrand. \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset \n \n But the Northeast corridor\u2019s stunned disbelief at what it saw as a loony conspiracy theory is replaced with hollers of support among Bachmann\u2019s many devoted fans here in the exurbs north of the Twin Cities that she represents. \n \n (Also on POLITICO: Republicans line up to rip Michele Bachmann) \n \n If anything, the uproar seems to have galvanized her base. And the contrasting reaction demonstrates why Democrats will have a hard time in their latest effort to unseat the GOP lightning rod. \n \n Supporters like Duane Halstad, a 69-year-old who was sitting on a porch watching a parade here, said Bachmann is the \u201conly one telling the truth about this thing.\u201d He also said he believes President Barack Obama vacations on Martha\u2019s Vineyard to observe the Islamic holiday of Ramadan. Obama is a Christian. \n \n Rachel Olson, a 41-year-old from Isanti said flatly that she doesn\u2019t \u201cthink [Bachmann] would make something up.\u201d \n \n The theme that emerged in roughly two dozen interviews over the weekend \u2014 at parades and a county fair \u2014 is echoed within Bachmann\u2019s inner circle. \n \n (PHOTOS: Moments from Bachmann's political career) \n \n Bachmann has long been drawn to the idea that Muslim Brotherhood agents are infiltrating the government \u2014 even before she landed a seat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Ron Carey, former chairman of the Minnesota Republican Party and Bachmann\u2019s chief of staff in 2010, said he was present during a private briefing in her office about the group. Bachmann is simply \u201cprivy to information that you and I don\u2019t have.\u201d \n \n \u201cIt was very sobering, some of the information this individual was sharing in this private meeting about the Muslim Brotherhood,\u201d Carey said. \u201cI think she\u2019s been exposed to a lot of discussion on the Hill, and it\u2019s been an area of tremendous interest with her.\u201d \n \n And just like that, the outlines of the post-presidential profile of Bachmann became abundantly clear. A year ago, the 56-year-old tea party favorite was flying high. Campaigning last year in Iowa, she was, for a time, the front-runner for the presidential nomination. \n \n Her campaign came apart at the seams, and she faded into the background of Republican politics. Many wondered if she\u2019d run for office again. \n \n But now, her political star has risen once again on the far right. She\u2019s become an annoyance for House Republican leaders, who say her conspiracy theories tarnish the party\u2019s brand and run afoul of their economy-focused message. \n \n Meanwhile, the left is again targeting her for defeat. \n \n Democrats spent millions in an unsuccessful bid to beat Bachmann in 2010. They had largely written her off this cycle, thinking a stronger Republican district would make her invincible. But the party seems to be focusing on Democrat Jim Graves, a wealthy Minneapolis businessman who is looking to cast himself as the moderate alternative to the unpredictable Bachmann. The slogan of his campaign is \u201cGetting back to business.\u201d ||||| Police and federal officials have placed security around ex-Rep.

Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) last week claimed Abedin\u2019s family had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and asked for a probe to see if she is helping the Islamist organization. \n \n The man was questioned by the NYPD and the State Department and has not been charged, sources said. ||||| Report cited by Bachmann claims Norquist linked to Muslim Brotherhood \n \n By Eric W.

Michele Bachmann (R-MN) cited in an attack on top State Department aide Huma Abedin. \n \n Earlier this month, Bachmann and four other Republicans sent a letter to inspectors general in the State, Homeland Security, Defense and Justice departments calling on them to investigate \u201cpotential Muslim Brotherhood infiltration\u201d of the Obama administration by Abedin, an aide to Secretary Clinton and wife of former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-NY). \n \n As evidence of their claims, the five Republicans cited \u201cThe Muslim Brotherhood in America: The Enemy Within,\u201d a ten-part video course produced by the Center for Security Policy. \n \n The movies claim that the \u201cMuslim Brotherhood was helped in its efforts to achieve information dominance over the George W.

(Photo: Douglas Healey, Bloomberg / Getty Images) Leave it to David Stockman, the acid-tongued former budget director for President Reagan, to make you feel even worse. \n \n \u201cBring it on,\u201d Stockman told me Thursday morning from his estate in Greenwich, Connecticut\u2014some 40 hours before the midnight Friday deadline that, absent an agreement between President Obama, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker John Boehner, will result in furloughs, federal dysfunction and untold harm to the fragile economy. \u201cI think the Republicans need to stand rigidly firm and shut the government down for a few days. The Obama White House is weak. If the Republicans hold the line, Obama will fold faster than a lawn chair. And the Republicans will get their $60 billion in reductions.\u201d \n \n Stockman described the impending showdown as a \u201cwakeup call\u201d\u2014the political equivalent of getting whacked in the head by a two-by-four containing a rusty nail. \n \n \u201cAnd then,\u201d Stockman added in a tone of lethal glee, \u201cthey\u2019re going to be calling their own bluff. Because at that point the problem will remain 98 percent as large as it was the morning before.\u201d \n \n The 64-year-old Stockman, who made millions as an investment banker after serving as a Michigan congressman and then Reagan\u2019s fiscal guru in the early 1980s, makes Debbie Downer sound like a cockeyed optimist. During a conversation punctuated by mirthless laughter, he characterized America\u2019s elected officials as \u201cthe fools inside the Beltway,\u201d dismissed House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, generally celebrated as the GOP\u2019s brightest policy star, as \u201can earnest young man\u201d who offers discredited ideology over practical solutions, and predicted a long and agonizing epoch in which incomes will fall, the economy will stall and reality\u2019s bite will leave painful tooth marks. \n \n \u201cIf the Republicans hold the line, Obama will fold faster than a lawn chair.\u201d \n \n \u2022 Patricia Murphy: The Tea Party\u2019s Budget Freakout \n \n \n \n \u2022 Daniel Stone: The Capitol Hill Shutdown Slumber Party \n \n \n \n \u2022 Government Shutdown: Full coverage \u201cThe real issue now is that the Tea Party needs to shut down the government or shut down Boehner,\u201d Stockman said. \u201cBoehner is as prone to cave as Obama. So how can we have any confidence that Washington is ever going to address anything when you have two guys who love to kick the can down the road?\u201d \n \n Stockman went on: \u201cThe Democrats are not doing anything about their guy either. They should be pounding the table\u2014why aren\u2019t we cutting the defense budget by $100 billion a year instead of this embarrassing pinprick [$78 billion over five years] that [Defense Secretary Robert] Gates has come up with? It\u2019s unfortunate, but when you bury yourself in $52 trillion of debt\u2014public, private, business, housing and government\u2014you can\u2019t make it go away. Because all the people who loaned you that money think they have a contract with you to pay it back. So we\u2019re going to go through a massive workout, and during that process I don\u2019t think the economy\u2019s going to grow\u2014it\u2019s going to struggle and suffer. Those are the facts that Washington is unwilling to face.\u201d \n \n Stockman\u2014who in 1981 wrote the guidelines for a government shutdown that, three decades later, are still the template for the action he favors\u2014insisted that the economic consequences of temporarily laying off one-fourth of the country\u2019s 4 million federal employees and closing the doors of various agencies, have been greatly exaggerated in the service of demagoguery. \n \n \u201cI think that\u2019s a lot of baloney that\u2019s being put out by the interest groups and lobbies and the White House,\u201d Stockman told me, reacting to the Democrats\u2019 dire claims of a new recession. \u201cA few days or even a few weeks of a very few people on furlough\u2014most of whom are likely to get back pay, because that has been the precedent in the past\u2014once this crisis is over, how is that going to affect a $15 trillion economy? \n \n \u201cIf the Smithsonian, the Parks Service and the Cherry Blossom Festival get delayed or canceled, it\u2019s the wakeup call that we really needed. The fools inside the Beltway are borrowing $100 billion month in and month out, and there\u2019s nobody left in the world buying except the central banks\u2014the Fed and the people\u2019s printing press of China. There\u2019s no way that\u2019s sustainable or viable. It\u2019s simply building up pressure in the monetary system that\u2019s going to blow sky-high.\u201d \n \n While cheering the Tea Party Republicans\u2019 demand of $60 billion in cuts, Stockman lamented their insistence on attaching polarizing policy riders forbidding funding for Planned Parenthood and other right-wing pariahs. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with that. It\u2019s unfortunate that these social issues get caught up in what essentially is the core fiscal question.\u201d \n \n Stockman took special aim at Chairman Ryan, who this week proposed a politically risky budget that Thursday garnered laurels from The Wall Street Journal for attacking the festering growth of entitlement costs, particularly through Medicare reform. \n \n \u201cI think he has a nice philosophical plan for the fiscal hereafter, two or three decades down the road,\u201d Stockman sniffed. \u201cBut it is neither courageous nor relevant when it comes to the fiscal here and now\u2026 It\u2019s a fine plan that starts in 2021. We need to deal with revenue, entitlements, defense and discretionaries, and the problem with his plan is it doesn\u2019t address more than one of those appropriately. Discretionaries, yes, but it totally whiffs on the other three\u2014which are much more important.\u201d \n \n Stockman points out that, at current levels, \u201cSocial Security and Medicare alone will cost $17.2 trillion over the next 10 years\u2014a startling number. How much does this courageous budget cut from the entitlements over the next 10 years? Zero! None! Nothing! Ryan is taking a nice philosophical stand for the by and by\u2014I call it the fiscal afterlife. But it\u2019s not relevant to the wolf that\u2019s at the door right now, and it\u2019s going to exact huge amounts of political cost and baggage for no gain at all on the fiscal front.\u201d \n \n Also galling to Stockman: \u201cThe Republicans have come with a plan to reduce the deficit that involves cutting taxes by $4.2 trillion over the next 10 years. This is the Ryan plan: burying us that much deeper because of this Republican catechism about tax cuts, anytime, anywhere, for any reason.\u201d Stockman said letting the current tax cuts expire, as called for in the next few years, will eventually produce $600 billion in deficit reduction. \u201cThe Republicans should just sit on their hands and let it happen.\u201d \n \n Meanwhile, Stockman told me that the abnormally low interest rate on the $14 trillion national debt\u2014currently near zero\u2014is likely to rise to normal levels in coming years by at least 300 basis points, or 3 percent. \u201cThis morning the European Central Bank started that process by raising interest rates\u2014a little more enlightened than the Fed. It\u2019s kind of ironic\u2014an increase of 300 basis points, a few quarters or years down the road, increases federal spending by half a trillion dollars. All of the assembled congressmen of every stripe and viewpoint\u2014from Tea Party to left-liberal\u2014could not come up with $500 billion in cuts between them.\u201d \n \n As a former congressman, Stockman acknowledged that the prospect of a shutdown isn\u2019t without peril for the House Republicans. After all, even right-wing firebrand Michele Bachmann, the de facto leader of the Tea Party in the House, is on record supporting efforts to avoid this severe outcome. \n \n \u201cMaybe the public doesn\u2019t like this,\u201d Stockman said. \u201cYou have this fight going on between the 83 youngsters, the Tea Party newbies, and the Boehner crowd that remembers 1995 well. If the public reacts badly to a shutdown, that will be a message to the Republicans that you are totally out to lunch, thinking you can address a $1.6 trillion deficit, and spending 43 cents on every dollar for borrowing, without tax increases. Because the public just shouted you down when you made the modest pinprick cut on your domestic spending, and to do that you shut down the government? We need to find out where the public is. \u201d \n \n Doubtless, we will. \n \n Lloyd Grove is editor at large for The Daily Beast.

We can\u2019t keep ignoring all of the evidence\u201d \n \n \u201cThere is incontrovertible evidence that Alzheimer\u2019s Disease has a dormant microbial component. We can\u2019t keep ignoring all of the evidence\u201d Professor Douglas Kell, Manchester University \n \n Currently most scientists are trying to find treatments which prevent the build of sticky amyloid plaques and misfolded tau proteins in the brain which prevent neurons from communicating with each other, leading to memory loss and cognitive decline. \n \n But in an the editorial in the Journal of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, it is suggested that it is a viral or bacterial infection which triggers the plaque build-up in the first place. Targeting them specifically with antimicrobial drugs could halt dementia. \n \n Professor Douglas Kell of the University of Manchester\u2019s School of Chemistry, said \u201cWe are saying there is incontrovertible evidence that Alzheimer\u2019s Disease has a dormant microbial component. We can\u2019t keep ignoring all of the evidence.\u201d \n \n There are currently 850,000 people living with dementia in Britain which is due to rise to one million by 2025 and two million by 2050. But despite 412 drugs trials taking place between 2002 and 2012, nothing has been shown to combat the disease. \n \n The authors say that viruses and bacteria are common in the brains of elderly people, and although they are usually dormant, they can \u2018wake up\u2019 after stress or if the immune system is compromised. Around two thirds of people will acquire the herpes virus at some point in their lives, and many will not realise they have it. \n \n Photo: ALAMY \n \n The herpes virus in particular is known to damage the central nervous system, and the limbic system in the brain which regulates mood and instinct and is associated with mental decline and personality changes. \n \n They also point to the fact that a gene mutation - APOEe4 - which makes one in five people more susceptible to Alzheimer\u2019s disease, also raises their susceptibility to infectious disease. Viral infections in the brain are already known to cause symptoms similar to Alzheimer\u2019s and the experts say the link has been \u2018neglected\u2019 for too long. \n \n \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s disease causes great emotional and physical harm to sufferers and their carers as well as having enormously damaging economic consequences,\u201d they write. \n \n \u201cWe write to express our concern that one particular aspect of the disease has been neglected, even though treatment based on it might slow or arrest Alzheimer\u2019s disease progression. \n \n \u201cWe refer to the many studies, mainly on humans, implicating specific microbes in the elderly brain, notably herpes simplex virus type 1, chlamydia pneumoniae and several types of spirochatete. \n \n \u201cWe propose that further research on the role of infectious agents in Alzheimer\u2019s disease causation, including prospective trials of antimicrobial therapy, is now justified.\u201d \n \n They say new findings could also have implications for the future treatment of Parkinson\u2019s Disease, and other progressive neurological conditions. \n \n Professor Resia Pretorius of the University of Pretoria, who worked with Prof Kell on the editorial, said \u201cThe microbial presence in blood may also play a fundamental role as causative agent of systemic inflammation, which is a characteristic of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \n \n \u201cFurthermore, there is ample evidence that this can cause neuroinflammation and plaque formation.\u201d \n \n Dementia charities said they had noticed that viruses and bacteria were more common in people with Alzheimer's disease. \n \n Dr James Pickett, Head of Research at Alzheimer\u2019s Society said: \u201cA large number of different microbes including viruses, bacteria and fungi have been found in the brains of older people - but there do appear to be more of them in the brains of people who have died with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \n \n \"While these observations are interesting and warrant further research, there is currently insufficient evidence to tell us that microbes are responsible for causing Alzheimer\u2019s disease in the vast majority of cases. We would like to reassure people that there remains no convincing evidence that Alzheimer\u2019s disease is contagious or can be passed from person to person like a virus. \n \n \u201cGiven the enormous global impact of dementia, there is intense interest from the research community to understand all the potential contributing factors. We welcome research that explores all possible avenues and have committed \u00a3100 million over the next decade to more fully understand the causes of dementia and to improve diagnosis, treatment and prevention of the condition.\u201d \n \n Last year, researchers found that the 'seeds' of Alzheimer's could be passed through blood transfusions and medical accidents. \n \n Prof John Hardy, Professor of Neuroscience, UCL, said: \u201cThis is a minority view in Alzheimer research. There had been no convincing proof of infections causing Alzheimer disease. We need always to keep an open mind but this editorial does not reflect what most researchers think about Alzheimer disease.\u201d \n \n Dr Simon Ridley, Director of Research at Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK, said: \u201cThere is growing evidence for the role of the immune system in Alzheimer\u2019s and active ongoing research looking at how an inflammatory response might contribute to the disease. There is some evidence to suggest that infections in general could ramp up the immune system and contribute to the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s, but there isn\u2019t conclusive evidence to suggest that a particular infectious agent or microbe could be directly responsible for causing the disease. \n \n \"There are many avenues being explored to understand the initial events that trigger the development of Alzheimer\u2019s and this is an important part of the research process for ruling in and out particular hypotheses. There is no evidence that Alzheimer\u2019s can be passed from person to person like a virus. Continued research funding into diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s is important to build a clearer picture of the genetic and lifestyle risk factors for the disease and use this knowledge to develop preventions or treatments.\u201d ||||| A worldwide team of senior scientists and clinicians have come together to produce an editorial which indicates that certain microbes - a specific virus and two specific types of bacteria - are major causes of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. Their paper, which has been published online in the highly regarded peer-reviewed journal, Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, stresses the urgent need for further research - and more importantly, for clinical trials of anti-microbial and related agents to treat the disease. \n \n \n \n This major call for action is based on substantial published evidence into Alzheimer's. The team\u2019s landmark editorial summarises the abundant data implicating these microbes, but until now this work has been largely ignored or dismissed as controversial - despite the absence of evidence to the contrary. Therefore, proposals for the funding of clinical trials have been refused, despite the fact that over 400 unsuccessful clinical trials for Alzheimer's based on other concepts were carried out over a recent 10-year period. \n \n \n \n Opposition to the microbial concepts resembles the fierce resistance to studies some years ago which showed that viruses cause certain types of cancer, and that a bacterium causes stomach ulcers. Those concepts were ultimately proved valid, leading to successful clinical trials and the subsequent development of appropriate treatments. \n \n \n \n Professor Douglas Kell of The University of Manchester\u2019s School of Chemistry and Manchester Institute of Biotechnology is one of the editorial\u2019s authors. He says that supposedly sterile red blood cells were seen to contain dormant microbes, which also has implications for blood transfusions. ||||| We are researchers and clinicians working on Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) or related topics, and we write to express our concern that one particular aspect of the disease has been neglected, even though treatment based on it might slow or arrest AD progression. We refer to the many studies, mainly on humans, implicating specific microbes in the elderly brain, notably herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1), Chlamydia pneumoniae, and several types of spirochaete, in the etiology of AD [1\u20134]. Fungal infection of AD brain [5, 6] has also been described, as well as abnormal microbiota in AD patient blood [7]. The first observations of HSV1 in AD brain were reported almost three decades ago [8]. The ever-increasing number of these studies (now about 100 on HSV1 alone) warrants re-evaluation of the infection and AD concept. \n \n AD is associated with neuronal loss and progressive synaptic dysfunction, accompanied by the deposition of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide, a cleavage product of the amyloid-\u03b2 protein precursor (A\u03b2PP), and abnormal forms of tau protein, markers that have been used as diagnostic criteria for the disease [9, 10]. These constitute the hallmarks of AD, but whether they are causes of AD or consequences is unknown. We suggest that these are indicators of an infectious etiology. In the case of AD, it is often not realized that microbes can cause chronic as well as acute diseases; that some microbes can remain latent in the body with the potential for reactivation, the effects of which might occur years after initial infection; and that people can be infected but not necessarily affected, such that \u2018controls\u2019, even if infected, are asymptomatic [2]. \n \n EVIDENCE FOR AN INFECTIOUS/IMMUNE COMPONENT (i) Viruses and other microbes are present in the brain of most elderly people [11\u201313]. Although usually dormant, reactivation can occur after stress and immunosuppression; for example, HSV1 DNA is amplified in the brain of immunosuppressed patients [14]. \n \n (ii) Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) produces damage in localized regions of the CNS related to the limbic system, which are associated with memory, cognitive and affective processes [15], as well as personality (the same as those affected in AD). \n \n (iii) In brain of AD patients, pathogen signatures (e.g., HSV1 DNA) specifically colocalize with AD pathology [13, 16, 17]. \n \n (iv) HSV infection, as revealed by seropositivity, is significantly associated with development of AD [18\u201321]. \n \n (v) AD has long been known to have a prominent inflammatory component characteristic of infection (reviewed in [22, 23]). \n \n (vi) Polymorphisms in the apolipoprotein E gene, APOE , that modulate immune function and susceptibility to infectious disease [24], also govern AD risk (reviewed in [25, 26]). Genome-wide association studies reveal that other immune system components, including virus receptor genes, are further AD risk factors [27\u201332]. \n \n (vii) Features of AD pathology are transmissible by inoculation of AD brain to primates [33, 34] and mice [35, 36]. \n \n EVIDENCE FOR CAUSATION (i) In humans, brain infection (e.g., by HIV, herpesvirus, measles) is known to be associated with AD-like pathology [37\u201342]. Historical evidence shows that the clinical and pathological hallmarks of AD occur also in syphilitic dementia, caused by a spirochaete [4]. \n \n (ii) In mice and in cell culture, A\u03b2 deposition and tau abnormalities typical of AD are observed after infection with HSV1 [43\u201352] or bacteria [16, 53\u201355]; a direct interaction between A\u03b2PP and HSV1 has been reported [56]. Antivirals, including acyclovir, in vitro block HSV1-induced A\u03b2 and tau pathology [57]. \n \n (iii) Olfactory dysfunction is an early symptom of AD [58]. The olfactory nerve, which leads to the lateral entorhinal cortex, the initial site from where characteristic AD pathology subsequently spreads through the brain [59, 60], is a likely portal of entry of HSV1 [61] and other viruses [62], as well as Chlamydia pneumoniae, into the brain [63], implicating such agents in damage to this region. Further, brainstem areas that harbor latent HSV directly irrigate these brain regions: brainstem virus reactivation would thus disrupt the same tissues as those affected in AD [64]. \n \n GROWING EVIDENCE FOR MECHANISM: ROLE OF A\u03b2 (i) The gene encoding cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) is selectively upregulated by virus infection, and its enzymatic product (25-hydroxycholesterol, 25OHC) induces innate antiviral immunity [65, 66]. \n \n (ii) Polymorphisms in human CH25 H govern both AD susceptibility and A\u03b2 deposition [67], arguing that A\u03b2 induction is likely to be among the targets of 25OHC, providing a potential mechanistic link between infection and A\u03b2 production [68]. \n \n (iii) A\u03b2 is an antimicrobial peptide with potent activity against multiple bacteria and yeast [69]. A\u03b2 also has antiviral activity [70\u201372]. \n \n (iv) Another antimicrobial peptide (\u03b2-defensin 1) is upregulated in AD brain [73]. Regarding HSV1, about 100 publications by many groups indicate directly or indirectly that this virus is a major factor in the disease. They include studies suggesting that the virus confers risk of the disease when present in brain of carriers of the \u025b4 allele of APOE [74], an established susceptibility factor for AD (APOE \u025b4 determines susceptibility in several disorders of infectious origin [75], including herpes labialis, caused usually by HSV1). The only opposing reports, two not detecting HSV1 DNA in elderly brains and another not finding an HSV1\u2013APOE association, were published over a decade ago [76\u201378]. However, despite all the supportive evidence, the topic is often dismissed as \u2018controversial\u2019. One recalls the widespread opposition initially to data showing that viruses cause some types of cancer, and that a bacterium causes stomach ulcers. In summary, we propose that infectious agents, including HSV1, Chlamydia pneumonia, and spirochetes, reach the CNS and remain there in latent form. These agents can undergo reactivation in the brain during aging, as the immune system declines, and during different types of stress (which similarly reactivate HSV1 in the periphery). The consequent neuronal damage\u2014 caused by direct viral action and by virus-induced inflammation\u2014 occurs recurrently, leading to (or acting as a cofactor for) progressive synaptic dysfunction, neuronal loss, and ultimately AD. Such damage includes the induction of A\u03b2 which, initially, appears to be only a defense mechanism. AD causes great emotional and physical harm to sufferers and their carers, as well as having enormously damaging economic consequences. Given the failure of the 413 trials of other types of therapy for AD carried out in the period 2002\u20132012 [79], antiviral/antimicrobial treatment of AD patients, notably those who are APOE \u025b4 carriers, could rectify the \u2018no drug works\u2019 impasse. We propose that further research on the role of infectious agents in AD causation, including prospective trials of antimicrobial therapy, is now justified.",

They point to the failure of 413 Alzheimer's drug trials conducted between 2002 and 2012 and \"express our concern that one particular aspect of the disease has been neglected,\" as \"antiviral/antimicrobial treatment of AD patients ... could rectify the 'no drug works' impasse.\" Meanwhile, not all are convinced, with one neuroscience professor framing theirs as a \"minority view\"; he tells the Telegraph there has \"been no convincing proof of infections causing\" the disease.

(Associated Press) \n \n WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 An immigration adviser to President-elect Donald Trump and a possible candidate for a top government post wants to make some changes at the Homeland Security Department, including recreating a system that required certain immigrants, including men and boys from 25 mostly Muslim nations, to register with the federal government upon their arrival. \n \n Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach met with Trump on Sunday and brought with him a detailed list of proposals for the agency tasked with enforcing immigration laws and securing the border. Kobach carried his \"Department of Homeland Security Kobach Strategic Plan for First 365 Days\" into his meeting with Trump. It was visible in a photograph from The Associated Press. \n \n The top suggestion was to \"update and reintroduce\" the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System, or NSEERS, for all foreigners from \"high-risk\" areas, a program he helped create while working for the Justice Department in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. \n \n The effort, which ultimately included the registration of more than 80,000 foreigners, was widely derided by civil rights groups who said it profiled foreigners based on their race and religion. \n \n The document, which is partially obscured by Kobach's left arm and hand, does not specify which foreigners would be required to register as part of an NSEERS update. \n \n Kobach did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \n \n The Obama administration formally abandoned the system in April 2011, saying a newer data collection program would be sufficient to collect biometric information for all foreigners coming into the country. \n \n Kobach's plan also proposes adding \"extreme vetting questions for high-risk\" foreigners coming into the U.S. Those would include questions about a would-be visitor's \"support for Sharia law, jihad, equality of men and women, the United States constitution.\" \n \n The Kansan's list also included ending the flow of Syrian refugees into the United States. As a candidate, Trump proposed a temporary ban on all Muslims coming into the country. \n \n Several other suggestions for DHS were obscured in the photo, taken as Kobach was greeted by Trump. \n \n Immigration was a top issue for Trump in his campaign to win the White House. He has yet to provide specific details about his plans to carry out campaign promises on immigration but last week announced his intention to nominate Sen. Jeff Sessions to lead the Justice Department. \n \n Sessions, like Kobach, has helped Trump craft his stance on immigration and is also a hard liner on the issue. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press reporter John Hanna in Topeka, Kansas, contributed to this report. ||||| A written plan for the Department of Homeland Security brought by Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach into his meeting with President-elect Donald Trump spells out a desire to question \u201chigh-risk\u201d immigrants over support for Sharia law and the U.S. Constitution. \n \n Kobach, an early Trump supporter, met with the president-elect on Sunday and has been mentioned as a potential pick for a position within the administration. Some speculation has centered on the secretary of Homeland Security, and Kobach\u2019s plan appears to lend credence to that possibility. \n \n An Associated Press photographer shot an image of Kobach going into the meeting and clutching a binder along with a stack of papers. One page is visible and readable, though partly obscured by Kobach\u2019s hand. \n \n The document is arranged in a numbered format. The first point reads, \u201cBar the Entry of Potential Terrorists.\u201d \n \n The document calls for updating and reintroducing the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System. The program was implemented in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but largely suspended in 2011. \n \n \u201cAll aliens from high-risk areas are tracked,\u201d the document reads. \n \n The document mirrors what Kobach told Reuters in the days after the election. In an interview with the news service, he said an immigration policy group might recommend reinstating the NSEERS system, which would act as a registry of immigrants. \n \n Kobach was one of the original architects of the system, which was implemented under Attorney General John Ashcroft and President George W. Bush. \n \n The document then calls for \u201cextreme vetting questions\u201d for \u201chigh-risk aliens,\u201d echoing Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric. High-risk aliens would be questioned about support for Sharia law (Islamic religious law), jihad, the equality of men and women, and the U.S. Constitution. \n \n The document also asks for reducing the intake of Syrian refugees to zero. In response, the American Relief Coalition for Syria, a coalition of 13 Syrian-American humanitarian organizations, said such a move would be \u201cdeeply immoral\u201d on the part of the United States. \n \n The document contains obscured references to the arrest and removal of illegal aliens, \u201c386 miles of existing actual wall,\u201d the post-Sept. 11 PATRIOT Act, and voter rolls. \u201cDraft amendments to National Voter \u2014\u201d can also be seen, perhaps a reference to the National Voter Registration Act. \n \n The rest of the page is either partially or totally obscured by Kobach\u2019s hand and arm. When the photograph was taken, Kobach was standing outside with Trump \u2014 it is highly unlikely Kobach wasn\u2019t aware he was being photographed. \n \n A spokeswoman for Kobach didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. \n \n \u201cKris is a really talented guy,\u201d Gov. Sam Brownback said Monday after he lit the Statehouse Christmas tree. \u201cHe\u2019s done a great job as secretary of state. He\u2019s a talented guy. I wish him all the best.\u201d \n \n Illegal immigration is a core passion for Kobach. A high-level position in the Trump administration would represent a culmination of his work on the subject and provide him a platform to enact the policies he for which he has advocated. \n \n A 2015 profile of Kobach in The Wichita Eagle traced his interest in immigration to the aftermath of 9/11. \n \n \u201cThey (the hijackers) successfully abused our immigration system, and much of my time at the Justice Department was occupied in trying to plug the holes that they had exploited in our system,\u201d Kobach told the newspaper. \n \n On Monday, the Council on American-Islamic Relations expressed alarm at Kobach\u2019s plan and the document\u2019s proposal for what the organization called \u201cinquisition-style questions.\u201d Yet spokesman Ibrahim Hooper said he wasn\u2019t surprised. \n \n \u201cI think this is unfortunately in line with the actions we\u2019ve seen from President-elect Trump\u2019s transition team,\u201d Hooper said. \n \n Micah Kubic, director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas, said Kobach has a clear record of working to make voting more difficult, and life more difficult for immigrants. He said tools, such as the NSEERS, based on religious identity, are very concerning. \n \n \u201cAll of that we find reprehensible, unconstitutional, illegal and un-American,\u201d Kubic said. \n \n A Trump transition team statement on the Sunday meeting said Trump and Kobach met \u201cto discuss border security, international terrorism, and reforming federal bureaucracy.\u201d \n \n Kobach has built a national reputation as a proponent of hard-line stances on immigration and election law. As Kansas secretary of state, he is embroiled in litigation \u2013 defending the state\u2019s proof of citizenship voting law. \n \n Kobach endorsed Trump before the Kansas GOP caucus. He also said he was advising Trump, including on the concept of building a wall and making Mexico pay for it \u2014 a core plank of Trump\u2019s platform. \n \n Kansas Senate Minority Leader Anthony Hensley, D-Topeka, criticized Kobach for openly carrying such a document. \n \n \u201cThat\u2019s the height of irony if he\u2019s wanting a job in Homeland Security and you\u2019re able to see in a photograph what should be confidential information,\u201d Hensley said. \n \n More recently, Kobach has said he is advising Trump\u2019s transition efforts. \n \n \u201cHe also hit themes you don\u2019t normally see presidential candidates hitting on immigration. You\u2019ll usually see them just grazing the surface and mentioning, \u2018OK, illegal immigration is a problem, America\u2019s a country of immigrants, now let\u2019s move on.\u2019 But what Trump did was he really dove pretty deeply on a lot of topics,\u201d Kobach said after Trump delivered an immigration-focused address this fall.",

Vanderbilt University \n \n Buy Photo Workers cover up the name on the exterior of Confederate Memorial Hall at Vanderbilt University on Monday, Aug. 15, 2016. Vanderbilt will repay an 83-year-old donation, allowing it to remove the Confederate name from the residence hall. (Photo: Andrew Nelles / The Tennessean)Buy Photo Story Highlights Confederate Memorial Hall opened 1935 with support from United Daughters of the Confederacy. \n \n Vanderbilt first sought to change the name in 2002. \n \n Starting in 2005, the university began referring to the building as Memorial Hall. \n \n To change the name, Vanderbilt raised $1.2 million to repay the United Daughters of the Confederacy. \n \n Vanderbilt University will repay an 83-year-old donation in order to remove from a residence hall what its leader called \"a symbol and a reminder of racism, slavery and a very, very bloody Civil War.\" \n \n \n \n Chancellor Nicholas S. Zeppos made the announcement Monday, capping a 14-year effort to rename Confederate Memorial Hall. The building, which has had that name etched into the stone above its entrance since it opened in 1935, stands in the heart of the university's freshman commons, and has frequently spurred debate about the university's attitude toward an increasingly diverse student body. \n \n In an interview with The Tennessean, Zeppos \u2014 who arrived on campus as a law professor in 1987 \u2014 said he had long been in favor of changing the building's name. \n \n \"It's a symbol that is, for many people, deeply offensive and painful,\" Zeppos said in the interview. \"And to walk past it or to have to live in that space is really something that I just don't think is acceptable.\" \n \n The United Daughters of the Confederacy originally donated $50,000 in 1933 toward the building\u2019s construction and naming rights in order to honor Confederate soldiers who died during the Civil War. \n \n Vanderbilt previously attempted to rename the building Memorial Hall in 2002, but the Tennessee Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy sued to keep the original name. A Tennessee appeals court ruled in 2005 that Vanderbilt could remove \u201cConfederate\u201d from the inscription only after it had returned the donation at its current value. \n \n Anonymous donors recently gave the university the $1.2 million needed for that purpose; the Vanderbilt Board of Trust authorized the move this summer. \n \n Doug Jones, the Nashville attorney who represented the Daughters of the Confederacy against Vanderbilt, called the move \"a real slam on the history of our country.\" \n \n \u201cAll it was was just a simple monument for the boys in Tennessee that died\u201d in the Civil War, Jones said, adding that the name was not connected with slavery. \u201cWe think rewriting history\u2019s just terrible. And I think it\u2019s a very sad day for a school with that kind of reputation to be condoning that.\" \n \n Universities across the country have faced similar decisions as they re-evaluated the implications of their buildings' names. Students and officials at Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro have spent months pushing to remove the name of Nathan Bedford Forrest, a founder of the Ku Klux Klan, from a campus building. MTSU and the Tennessee Board of Regents approved the change, which now goes before a state panel. \n \n Zeppos flatly rebuffed the criticism that changing the name of a residence hall would compromise the university's approach to its long and complicated history. \n \n \"We are not saying this is not part of Vanderbilt's history,\" he said. \"I think we teach history by how we talk about these events. \n \n \"I don't think that that (name) was really teaching anyone history.\" \n \n The longstanding effort to rename the residence hall took on renewed urgency over the past couple of years, as universities across Tennessee and the country grappled with the shadow of racism and slavery on their campuses. At Vanderbilt, founded in 1873 just eight years after the Civil War ended, the name change follows a series of changes made over the past year to address diversity, including the addition of a chief diversity officer to the university's leadership team. \n \n In 2005, Vanderbilt officially began referring to the building as Memorial Hall, although the word Confederate remained on its facade. Students, faculty and high-ranking administrators argued passionately to remove the word at a town hall on the subject last fall. \n \n Ariana Fowler, president of Vanderbilt Student Government, praised the university leadership for the decision to formally rename the residence hall. \n \n \u201cThis action demonstrates the administration's attentiveness to student needs and concerns, as well as sets a great precedent for advocating on behalf of those who may feel marginalized on our campus,\u201d Fowler said in the university statement. \u201cThis is an excellent next step in the direction of becoming an institution that not only admits diverse students, but ensures their care and support \u2014 one who is eager to eliminate any barriers that may stand in the way of such a goal.\u201d \n \n Zeppos said the decision to remove the mention of the Confederacy from the building spoke to the courage of students, faculty and staff who spoke out against it for years. \n \n \"I hope that they feel as if they've made a big difference in Vanderbilt and in Vanderbilt's history themselves,\" he said. \"It hopefully says we have listened, we have made changes. But I don't think we should assume that our work is completed in any way.\" \n \n Crews were already working Monday night to cover the name over the building\u2019s entrance. \n \n Reach Adam Tamburin at 615-726-5986 and on Twitter @tamburintweets. \n \n Vanderbilt University began referring to Confederate Memorial Hall as Memorial Hall in 2005.

The private university announced... (Associated Press) \n \n NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Vanderbilt University announced Monday that it will pay more than a million dollars to remove an inscription containing the word \"Confederate\" from one of its campus dorms. \n \n The private university has referred to the Confederate Memorial Hall simply as \"Memorial Hall\" since 2002, but was blocked in court from changing the name chiseled on the building because it was constructed with the help of a $50,000 gift from the United Daughters of the Confederacy in 1933. \n \n Under the agreement, Vanderbilt will pay $1.2 million, the equivalent of the gift made 83 years ago, to the organization's Tennessee chapter. In exchange, the chapter will relinquish its naming rights to the building. \n \n \"You can memorialize individuals without taking sides in the bloodiest war that was fought over the divisive issues of slavery and equality that we're still struggling with today for those young people coming onto campus,\" Vanderbilt Chancellor Nicholas Zeppos said in a phone interview. \n \n The money has been pledged by anonymous donors, and Zeppos said the school chooses to focus on \"moving Vanderbilt forward\" rather than on what projects the Daughters of the Confederacy will spend the funds on, especially in light of a new Tennessee law that makes it more difficult to remove Confederate symbols and statues from public places. \n \n \"The donors and I and others understand that this donation will go to another organization, but this is a very positive step for Vanderbilt,\" Zeppos said. \n \n The Daughters of the Confederacy did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. \n \n About 30 miles to the southeast, Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro wants to remove the name of Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest from one of its buildings. The public higher education system overseeing the school endorsed the change last month, but the proposal faces a tougher hurdle when it reaches the Tennessee Historical Commission. \n \n Under the \"Tennessee Heritage Protection Act\" passed earlier this year, it now takes a vote of at least two-thirds of the commission to approve changing or removing historical markers. That's an increase from the previous requirement of a simple majority vote. \n \n Calls to remove Confederate imagery from public places multiplied across the South after last year's slaying of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina. A white man espousing racist views and who posed in a photo with a Confederate flag has been charged with murder in the killings. \n \n Following the church shooting, Republican Gov. Bill Haslam said he supported removing the Capitol bust of Forrest, who is famous for his exploits as a Confederate cavalry general and amassed a fortune as a plantation owner and slave trader in Memphis before the Civil War. \n \n After the defeat of the Confederacy, the newly formed Ku Klux Klan elected Forrest its honorary grand wizard, though he publicly denied being involved. Two years later, he ordered the Klan to disband because of its members' increasing violence. \n \n The Forrest bust remains in the lobby between the House and Senate chambers at the state Capitol.",

A state appeals court ruled the building could be renamed Memorial Hall only after Vanderbilt gave the United Daughters back their money\u2014$1.2 million in today\u2019s dollars. The university has the cash, thanks to a raft of anonymous contributors who wanted the tie to America\u2019s painful past broken for good. \"It's a symbol that is, for many people, deeply offensive and painful,\" Zeppos told the Tennessean. \"And to walk past it or to have to live in that space is really something that I just don't think is acceptable.\u201d Yet tampering with Confederate imagery remains controversial, and a new state law makes it harder to do so, the AP reports.

That was when Kristine Barry learned her baby had a heart defect that would require what\u2019s believed to be the world\u2019s first use of in utero surgery to treat this condition. Doctors at the Hospital for Sick Children and Mount Sinai Hospital were quick to assure Barry, 25, and her husband, Christopher Havill, 27, that they could fix the problem. \n \n Doctors in Toronto performed in-utero surgery when a now two-month-old baby boy had a life-threatening heart condition. The boy?s parents say it was ?intense? to learn the procedure would be carried out in the womb. (The Canadian Press) \n \n They diagnosed the couple\u2019s first child, Sebastian Havill, now 9 weeks old, with severe complete transposition of the great arteries (TGA). It\u2019s a congenital heart defect that occurs when the pulmonary artery and aorta are switched, and the heart can\u2019t adequately circulate blood through the body. Barry said her first thoughts were \u201cWhy me, why my baby?\u201d To fix the problem, surgeons normally perform open-heart surgery on the infant to switch the arteries within a week of birth.

With ultrasound guidance, the doctors inserted a needle into Barry\u2019s uterus and into Sebastian\u2019s heart to blow up a tiny ballon, making a hole about 3.5 millimetres wide in his atrial septum. This allowed the blood and oxygen to circulate properly, a temporary fix until they could perform surgery after birth. \n \n Baby Sebastian with his parents Christopher Havill and Kristine Barry at The Hospital for Sick Children. Five days before he was born, a surgical procedure was performed on Sebastian's heart while he was still in his mother's womb. ( Randy Risling / Toronto Star ) \n \n About 30 medical staff were there to assist in the procedure, including surgeons, cardiologists, a person with an incubator and a doctor to do a caesarean section in the likely case that Barry had to give birth early. \u201cI was weirdly calm. I put all my belief in that it was going to work, but I went in with the mindset that I was having a baby that day,\u201d Barry said. \u201cThe way they described our options for that day, I had a two-out-of-three chance for having a baby, so I went in thinking, \u2018I could be meeting my son today.\u2019\u201d \n \n Article Continued Below \n \n Just 20 minutes later, the surgery was over and the room erupted in applause, said Barry, who cried when she realized that her baby could be born healthy. Five days after the surgery, Barry was induced into labour and gave birth to Sebastian only 10 minutes in. \u201cHe came out pink and screaming, and I was just in shock. I didn\u2019t believe that was what was going to happen,\u201d she said. A week after his birth, Sebastian successfully underwent the open-heart surgery that babies with congenital TGA must have, and he was sent home the week after. About three babies a year in Ontario have the same extreme case of congenial heart defect that Sebastian has. His parents will take him to a neuro-development program at Sick Kids to make sure he\u2019s hitting all his milestones at 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months old. Barry and Havill have been told that Sebastian may run into issues at any stage in his development, but in general he is expected to lead a normal life. If Sebastian has any development problems, Barry said, the doctors at Sick Kids can help by teaching them exercises to do at home, or sending a support worker to help with speech or physiotherapy. \u201cThey want us to let him be a kid and run around and get his blood pumping and his heart working really well. They don\u2019t want us bubble-wrapping him and being too protective,\u201d Barry said. \u201cThey want him to live a normal life as much as possible.\u201d ||||| Kristine Barry says when she heard her newborn baby Sebastian scream, it was \"the most amazing sound I've ever heard.\" \n \n \"They always prepped us for a blue baby,\" she said. \"They always said that he was going to be blue and not vocal because of the lack of oxygen.\" \n \n But when Sebastian arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto in May, \"there's this little guy all pink and screaming.\" \n \n It would have been a very different and traumatic birth if Sebastian had not undergone a surgical procedure on his heart, known as a balloon atrial septoplasty, five days earlier \u2014 while he was still in his mother's womb. \n \n During Barry's prenatal checkups, Sebastian was diagnosed with a severe congenital heart defect, in which the two main arteries of the heart are reversed. His case was especially complex because the interior walls of his heart were sealed shut, so that blood couldn't flow between the chambers to pick up oxygen. \n \n \"We had a baby with the two sides of the circulation that were not communicating. There was no opening between the upper chambers and the lower chambers and the vessels were coming off the wrong side,\" says Dr. Greg Ryan, head of the fetal medicine program at Mount Sinai Hospital. \n \n \"So what we had to do was to create a communication to allow the blood to mix.\" \n \n 'The clock ticks' \n \n In most cases, newborn babies with heart defects can be rushed from the neonatal unit at Mount Sinai Hospital to the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) across the street, says Dr. Rajiv Chaturvedi, a cardiologist at SickKids. \n \n But the closed walls of Sebastian's heart made it unable to automatically circulate oxygen once he lost access to the oxygen supplied via the placenta. That meant there would be little time to save Sebastian from severe complications after he left his mother's womb. \n \n \"The clock ticks [so] that you have a few minutes and you start having brain damage and other organ damage,\" says Dr. Edgar Jaeggi, head of the fetal cardiac program at SickKids. \n \n Christopher Havill and Kristine Barry are enjoying a normal life at home with their newborn son, Sebastian, thanks to his heart surgeries \u2014 one of which was performed while he was still in his mother's womb. (CBC News) \n \n So on May 18, Ryan, Chaturvedi and Jaeggi, along with dozens of clinicians from both Mount Sinai Hospital and SickKids performed a risky and remarkable procedure: a balloon atrial septoplasty while the baby is still in the uterus. \n \n With neonatal and cardiac surgeons on standby in case an emergency cesarean section became necessary, the doctors used a needle to insert a balloon through Barry's uterus and into Sebastian's heart, making a small hole to open up the heart's interior wall, so oxygenated blood could pass through. \n \n Although the procedure was a success, it wasn't a cure for Sebastian's original heart defect, and he would still require open-heart surgery after birth. But it meant that Barry could deliver him normally, without the trauma of knowing it would be a frantic race against time to whisk her baby away and supply him with oxygen. \n \n A healthy start \n \n In fact, Sebastian's father, Christopher Havill, had time to cut the umbilical cord \u2014 and he remembers the team even told them they could take pictures. \n \n Surgeons repeated the same procedure they had done in-utero on Sebastian that day to further ensure the flow of oxygen. A week later, he had open-heart surgery to fix his reversed arteries. Two months later, he's a normal baby at home in Barrie, Ont., fussing on his mother's lap as his dad smiles and soothes him. \n \n \"He's such a good little cuddle buddy,\" Havill says. \n \n The doctors have even told the couple that Sebastian's scar from his open heart surgery will eventually fade, and will be barely visible by adulthood. \n \n \"These kids can play soccer, play hockey, go to university, have pretty normal lives,\" Chaturvedi says. ||||| \n \n Sheryl Ubelacker, The Canadian Press \n \n \n \n \n \n TORONTO -- Watching Kristine Barry and husband Christopher Havill cuddle their two-month-old son Sebastian, it's hard to believe their little guy has been through more major medical procedures in his short life -- and even before being born -- than many people experience in a lifetime. \n \n Weeks before his birth in May, Toronto doctors discovered through imaging scans that Sebastian had not one, but two congenital heart defects -- and they knew they had to do something fairly radical to bring him into the world and give him a chance at a full and healthy life. \n \n That something was an in-utero procedure to poke a hole in the wall between the upper chambers of his tiny heart, which had developed with no opening, followed by an operation after birth to repair his major cardiac arteries, which weren't in the proper locations. \n \n Scans of Sebastian while in his mother's womb showed his aorta, the vessel that takes oxygen-rich blood to the brain and body, and his pulmonary artery, which channels blood to the lungs to be oxygenated, were switched -- a condition known as transposition of the great arteries, or TGA. \n \n Doctors also discovered there were no openings in the walls between either the two upper chambers (the atria) of his heart or the bottom two chambers (the ventricles), which would have prevented his blood from circulating properly after birth. While in the womb, fetal blood is oxygenated through the placenta. \n \n \"If a baby doesn't have any holes between the two sides, so the right and left half, the child would be deeply blue, and eventually will die from this condition unless we are able to create the hole after birth rapidly,\" said cardiologist Dr. Edgar Jaeggi, head of the fetal cardiac program at Sick Kids Hospital and part of the two-hospital team that cared for Barry and her soon-to-be born baby. \n \n \"This is a life-threatening condition that could result in rapid brain damage, with the baby doing very poorly and dying from this,\" Jaeggi explained. \n \n However, after Sebastian's birth, doctors would have had only a few minutes to open up his chest and repair his heart, requiring full neonatal resuscitation and cardiac surgery teams to be on stand-by. \n \n To avoid such a high-risk delivery and the dangers to the newborn, a team of doctors from Mount Sinai Hospital and Sick Kids opted to perform the procedure to create an opening between the upper chambers of Sebastian's heart while he was in the womb. \n \n \"It's pretty intense hearing something like that, that they're going to do it while he's still inside of her,\" Havill, 27, said Tuesday after he and his wife travelled to Sick Kids from their home in Barrie, Ont., north of Toronto. \n \n \"It's something you would think would only happen on a TV medical show, not in real life,\" agreed Barry, 25. \"Doing the in-utero procedure actually sounded like the best possible thing. In my gut, we knew this was what we wanted to happen, what we needed to do.\" \n \n On May 18, doctors at Mount Sinai took the first steps, injecting drugs through Barry's abdomen that put Sebastian to sleep, paralyzed his body to prevent him from moving, and provided pain relief. \n \n \"The baby obviously has to be in the right position,\" said Dr. Greg Ryan, head of the fetal medicine program at Mount Sinai. \n \n \"Because if the baby is not aligned in-utero, it's a non-starter, and we've sometimes had to wait for two or three days for the baby to come into position where it gives us our best shot -- because you have one shot and you need to make that work.\" \n \n Barry was then transported to Sick Kids across the street via an underground tunnel that connects the two hospitals, where Ryan performed the next part of the procedure under ultrasound-guided imagery, inserting a fine needle through Barry's abdomen and uterus, then into the upper chamber of Sebastian's heart and passing it through the wall to the adjacent atrium. \n \n A catheter was then fed through the needle and a tiny balloon inserted between the wall, a process that's similar to balloon angioplasty to open up a blocked coronary artery in those at risk of a heart attack. \n \n \"Then, essentially, we blow up the balloon in that wall which had been closed,\" explained Ryan. \"By blowing it up, we could open up a hole in the wall between the two chambers, and this allows the mixing of the blood. \n \n \"Once we've done that, we withdraw the needle and withdraw the catheter out of the baby's heart,\" he said, adding that he believes this is the first time in the world that the in-utero procedure has been performed in a fetus with TGA. \n \n Jaeggi said the team waited until Sebastian was almost full-term to do the in-utero surgery -- called a balloon atrial septoplasty, or BAS -- because doing so earlier might have allowed the hole to close up again. \n \n \"We wanted the biggest hole closest to delivery,\" he said, describing the opening as about 3.5 millimetres in diameter. \n \n On May 23, Barry gave birth through a regular vaginal delivery after being induced and Sebastian was born \"pink and screaming.\" \n \n \"They always primed us that we would be having a blue baby, so when he came out, I'm like 'That's not blue,\"' said Barry, recalling her huge sense of relief. \"He was here and he looked as babies should when they're born.\" \n \n Sebastian had a second BAS procedure after birth to ensure the atrial opening was large enough. Then five days later, surgeons at Sick Kids performed open-heart surgery on the infant to switch his aorta and pulmonary artery into their proper positions. \n \n Now weighing 10 pounds and meeting all his developmental milestones, Sebastian is like any other healthy two-month-old, his parents say. \n \n \"He's a pretty calm, pretty chill baby. He lets us know when he's not happy. He still has that very strong set of lungs that he was born with,\" Barry said. \"We just recently started getting our smiles from him.\" \n \n \"You barely even know that anything had happened to him unless you take off his shirt and see his scars,\" added Havill. \"He's just awesome.\" \n \n The couple say it's hard to express how grateful they are to the medical teams at the two hospitals. \n \n \"Thank you doesn't seem like enough, but definitely thanks to them for saving my baby's life,\" Barry said. \n \n \"It's just amazing what they're able and capable of doing.\"",

Putting the aorta and pulmonary artery in their rightful places would require open-heart surgery after birth. But because Barry's unborn son also had no opening to allow blood to flow between the upper and lower chambers of his heart, he would be unable to circulate oxygen through his body once separated from his mother's placenta, with brain and other organ damage occurring within minutes. \"He likely wasn't going to make it,\" Barry, 25, tells the Toronto Star.

    "document": "Baltimore Ravens cornerback Tray Walker has died from injuries he suffered in a crash in Florida Thursday night. \n \n Download the WBAL app \n \n Miami-Dade police Detective Dan Ferrin said Walker was riding a motor bike and was not wearing a helmet when he collided with a Ford Escape shortly before 8 p.m. Thursday at NW 21 Avenue and NW 75 Street in Miami. \n \n Walker, 23, died Friday afternoon. \n \n Police said they do not suspect alcohol or drugs as a factor in the crash, and neither do they believe Walker was racing. The bike that Walker was riding did not have lights, and Walker was wearing dark clothing. Ferrin said Walker was wearing a Ravens jersey. \n \n \"We have two sons not too much older than Tray, and we can't imagine how much his family is suffering,\" said owner Steve Bisciotti. \"This is so sad. The right words are hard to find at a time like this. As much as we can comfort Tray's mom and the rest of his family, we will.\" \n \n Head coach John Harbaugh said Walker had a good and kind heart. \n \n \"He was humble and loved everything about being part of the Ravens' team,\" Harbaugh said. \"He loved his teammates, the practice and the preparation, and that showed every day. He was coachable, did his most to improve and worked to become the best. I'll never forget that smile.\" \n \n Joe Flacco said Walker was full of energy and promise. \"This is very hard to wrap my head around, and I am devastated. As a parent, I cannot imagine what his family is going through right now. All of my thoughts are with them. My hope is that we can be a little bit of help by being a second family for them.\" \n \n Defensive Backs Coach Chris Hewitt: \"My heart is heavy as these words come out of my mouth. I pray for Tray's family and his loved ones. In football -- both on the field and in the meeting room -- you preach to your players to play every play as if it were their last. But to think that we are now going lay a player to rest is unbelievable. \n \n \"Tray was a young man who had a way about him that he could light up a room with his smile. Once you got to know him, he was one of the funniest guys. Whenever I got angry, he could make me laugh in a tense situation and bring me back to a cooler head. He challenged me as a coach, because he had a thirst for knowledge. And although things didn't always go his way, he was ready for the next battle or challenge that you presented to him. \n \n \"He had a vision of what he wanted to be as a player, and after last season he left our building determined that in 2016 he would be a household name in Baltimore. He had so much potential and was on his way to being a great NFL player. He will be missed and will never be forgotten.\" \n \n S Terrence Brooks: \"Tray will truly be missed by all who got to know him. I am taking this news pretty hard, because he was a guy who I took under my wing to help him with any little advice that I had gained from being in the NFL for a short amount of time. \n \n \"We vowed to each other to stick together and push each other as long as we remained on the same team. We both shared similar life experiences growing up in Florida. We sat together every day during meetings. He was like a little brother to me. I especially remember times he would drop by my house, and we would have long talks and laughs just about the NFL and everyday life. I truly felt a brotherly bond with him. \n \n \"Tray was a young man with so much life experience. I feel like he was much more of a man just because of where he grew up. Football was his escape. Not many understood that. It hurts my heart that he's not getting the chance to show the world just what type of man and football player he was going to be. I was looking forward to taking that field with him this year, because we both kept up with each other's progress this offseason. I really felt he was going to have a great year. \n \n \"But one thing I do know is that Tray will never leave my side. He will be watching over me every step of the way. I see just how precious life is, and I will fully dedicate my season to Tray.\" \n \n LB C.J. Mosley: \"Tray was a guy who constantly kept a smile on his face. He was always laughing and joking in the locker room, and was by far, always the best dressed. He had such great potential and was ready to learn how to be a Raven. My prayers go out to Tray and his family. He will be sorely missed.\" \n \n CB Jimmy Smith: \"This is such a tragedy, and I am praying for Tray's family. He was a tremendous young man with so much potential, and I will miss him. Tray had a hard shell, but once you broke through that, you found a person who was learning how to become a man and was so eager to be a great person and professional. I am heartbroken for his family.\" \n \n OLB Za'Darius Smith: \"This is a really hard day for my Ravens family and me. However, I know it is even harder for the family of Tray. I had the opportunity to be around a guy who was unique and a great person -- on and off the field. He was not only my teammate, but he was my brother. I send my condolences to his family and loved ones. Tray, you will truly be missed.\" \n \n WR Steve Smith Sr.: \"Times like this make you hug your kids tighter. A mother lost her son today, and a family lost their brother, including us, his extended family. Tray had a bright future ahead of him outside of football and was a guy who lit up the room with his personality. I will miss seeing him every day and seeing that bright smile he always wore. I pray that his family can find peace. Rest well, Tray.\" \n \n Walker was selected by the Ravens in the fourth round of the 2015 NFL Draft. He played in eight games for the Ravens last season, recording one solo tackle from scrimmage, but competed mostly on special teams. \n \n A native of Miami, Walker attended Miami Northwestern High School and then played at Texas Southern. \n \n Upon learning of Walker's accident but before his death, Harbaugh penned a letter to the players, which the Ravens shared on their website. \n \n Here is the text of that letter: \n \n An Open Letter to Our Team \n \n Men, \n \n Right now, this moment is an incredibly difficult time for our Team and our Family. One of our Brothers, Tray Walker, is fighting for his life. I know we are showering him, and covering he and his family, with Prayer and hope. \n \n That was the kind of phone call you never want get as a coach, as a parent, as a brother, as a friend. This shook me and all of us. Like some of you, I haven\u2019t been able to rest since hearing the news late last night. \n \n As I focused about Tray this morning, some thoughts came to mind that I wanted to share. What would I say to my own son, if I had a son, in a situation like this? You guys are that important to me. \n \n This is what I would be saying to you in the team meeting room if we were together today: There is a lot going on out there and you are going to be involved in tough and difficult situations. You are making and will continue to make important choices pretty much every day. That\u2019s okay. That\u2019s our reality. It can even be very good to be put in different circumstances. To make it right, you are going to have to grow up fast. Probably faster than many of your friends and family. \n \n Please remember to\u2026 \n \n Lead in your home. Take care of Your Family and Yourself every single day. Think about who you are and where you are going, and what you stand for. Look after one another. Only then can you be your most effective on the job and in every area of your life. \n \n Please consider your actions and choices. There are always consequences. Choose who you allow to advise you. Consider the quality of the council you take. Put yourself in positions to succeed. Turn away from unnecessary and risky behavior. Take care of your physical well-being. Live a healthy lifestyle. Pursue those things that make you better. Rest well. Eat well. Laugh with those who you love and love you. Fulfill your obligations effectively. \n \n Be your own best friend. Do not be an enemy onto yourself. Turn away from trouble and harm. Walk away from foolish behavior. Ignore silly and unwise advice \u2013 You\u2019ll know it when you see it. \n \n Get to know those people in your life who manage to walk free from the weight of self-created obstacles. Get close to those who have gone where you want to go, and have accomplished what you want to accomplish. Grow Spiritually. Think about what and who you want to become. \n \n I am asking you to consider what is at stake in your life. Consider what your thoughts, actions and choices mean to those around you. Live your life fully and with purpose. Have fun and share your happiness. Find Your Faith, and allow God to Grow Your Faith. \n \n Let\u2019s look out for one another. Be a great brother and friend. Inquire. Listen. Ask. Investigate. Reach out. Be There. Take a Step. Go For It. \n \n Remember, We are Brothers in Arms. And, again, take care of each other. \n \n John \n \n Refresh wbaltv.com and our app, and watch 11 News for late-breaking updates. ||||| FILE - This Oct. 26, 2015, file photo shows Baltimore Ravens cornerback Tray Walker (25) during the second half of an NFL football game in Glendale, Ariz.

An accelerant, such as gasoline, was possibly used. \n \n Police remained on the scene until shortly past 11:00 p.m. Monday.

Officials launched an investigation after the iconic Pacific Heights residence had its doormat set ablaze at 8 p.m. local time (11 p.m. ET) on Monday night, a San Francisco Police official told NBC News. The home was used in the filming of the 1993 movie starring actor Robin Williams, who took his own life in August last year. \n \n The home is now owned by a doctor who has been a pioneer in facial feminization surgeries. However, a police department official said the incident did not appear to be a hate crime. \n \n The Pacific Heights home used in the filming of the movie \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" served as a makeshift memorial site following the death of Robin Williams.

    "document": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The National Portrait Gallery is unveiling portraits of former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama. \n \n Barack Obama's portrait was painted by Kehinde Wiley \u2014 an artist best known for his vibrant, large-scale paintings of African-Americans. For Michelle Obama's portrait, the gallery commissioned Baltimore-based artist Amy Sherald, first-prize winner of the Portrait Gallery's 2016 Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition. \n \n The paintings were being unveiled Monday at the gallery, which is part of the Smithsonian group of museums. The gallery has a complete collection of presidential portraits. ||||| Washington (CNN) Barack and Michelle Obama re-emerged on the public stage Monday in Washington, only this time for an event that has nothing to do with politics. \n \n The former first couple's official portraits were unveiled at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery, a rite of passage for most former presidents, all of whom have their portraits hanging in the museum. \n \n These are perhaps the most anticipated presidential portrait unveilings to date, due in large part to the artists the Obamas selected. The former president chose Kehinde Wiley, a Yale University-trained painter famous for his depiction of African-Americans posed in the style of Old Master paintings, regal, formal and filled with pops of color. \n \n Barack Obama's portrait \n \n \"How about that? That's pretty sharp,\" the 44th president said as he took the podium. The portrait depicts him sitting against a backdrop of green foliage. Obama said he tried to negotiate with Wiley about his look for the painting. \n \n \"I tried to negotiate less gray hair, and Kehinde's artistic integrity would not allow him to do what I asked. I tried to negotiate smaller ears, struck out on that as well,\" joked Obama from the podium during his remarks. \n \n Obama also asked Wiley, who often depicts his subjects as regal and god-like, if the could ease up on those flourishes. \n \n \"I had to explain that I've got enough political problems without you making me look like Napoleon. We've got to bring it down just a touch. And that's what he did,\" the former president said. \n \n Barack Obama's choice of Wiley makes him the first African-American artist to execute an official presidential portrait for the National Portrait Gallery. \n \n \"What I was always struck by when I saw his portraits was the degree to which they challenged our ideas of power and privilege,\" Obama said. \n \n The juxtaposition of contemporary urban culture with centuries-old postures and wallpaper-like backgrounds make for bold paintings, of which Obama's is Wiley's most famous to date. \n \n Wiley apparently took thousands of photographs of Obama in order to create the portrait, a process different than the typical \"sittings\" required for most portraits. \n \n Wiley's background choice was also indicative of Obama's background. Wiley said he was \"charting his path on Earth.\" \n \n The different flowers woven into the greenery include the chyrsanthemum, the official flower of Chicago, and jasmine for Hawaii, there's even some African blue lilies, symbolic of Obama's heritage. \n \n Obama also pointed out his personal connection to Wiley -- both men shared similar familial experiences that shaped their futures. \n \n \"What we did find was that we had certain things in common. Both of us had American mothers who raised us with extraordinary love and support. Both of us had African fathers who had been absent from our lives, and in some ways our journeys involved searching for them, and what that meant. I ended up writing about that journey and channeling it into the work that I did because I cannot paint,\" he said. \n \n Michelle Obama's portrait \n \n Michelle Obama said she \"was a little overwhelmed, to say the least,\" after her portrait was unveiled. \"Let's just start by saying, 'Wow,' again,\" she said. Pointing to her mother, seated in the audience, she added: \"Hi Mom. Whatcha' think? Pretty nice, isn't it?\" \n \n For her portrait, Michelle Obama chose Baltimore-based artist Amy Sherald. Sherald is another African-American artist known for her unique style, and her portraits also tend to underscore themes of social justice. She often paints black skin tones in gray as a way to take away the assigned \"color\" of her subjects. Sherald's work is less about realism in composition and more about shape and color; like Wiley, the choice of Sherald ushers in a new era of presidential portrait. \n \n \"Amy, I want to thank you for so spectacularly capturing the grace and beauty and intelligence and charm and hotness of the woman I love,\" the former President said of his wife. \n \n Sherald's painting of Michelle Obama shows her in a flowing, patterned dress with a halter neckline; her expression is thoughtful, her chin resting on her hand. \n \n The former first lady said she was thinking about the impact Sherald's work will have on \"girls and girls of color.\" \n \n \"They will see an image of someone who looks like them hanging on the walls of this great American institution ... And I know the kind of impact that will have on their lives because I was one of those girls,\" she said. \n \n The Obamas looked at the portfolios of more than two dozen artists before deciding on Wiley and Sherald. Obama's portrait will hang in the hall of presidents and the former first lady's will be placed in another gallery. Both will be open to public viewing on Tuesday.",

He is seeking compensatory damages of at least $2 million. \n \n Among other things, according to the lawsuit, the record labels \u201cimproperly classified\u201d revenue from digital downloads of Carpenters\u2019 music as sales of records as opposed to licensing revenue \u2014 short-changing them from a higher royalty rate. The lawsuit also claims that the defendants undercounted digital downloads and that they applied an incorrect base price to the sales of CDs. \n \n The lawsuit notes that the lawsuit is similar to litigation involving the recordings of Eminem in which the defendants were several affiliates of UMG.

    "document": "NAME: Dominique Strauss-Kahn AGE: 62. Born in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France on April 25, 1949. \n \n EDUCATION: Degrees in law, business administration, political studies and statistics. PhD in economics from the University of Paris. \n \n FAMILY: Wife, Anne Sinclair, and four children by a previous marriage. \n \n CAREER: Managing director of the International Monetary Fund since 2007, where he won praise for his handling of the global financial crisis. Strauss-Kahn was an economics professor, corporate lawyer and legislator in France's National Assembly. He served as finance minister from 1997-1999 and helped France prepare to abandon the franc for the euro. He sought the Socialist Party's nomination for the 2007 presidential elections and is a possible candidate in next year's presidential vote. He has been a visiting professor at Stanford University. \n \n QUOTE: \"While this incident constituted an error in judgment on my part, for which I take full responsibility, I firmly believe that I have not abused my position,\" Strauss-Kahn wrote in an email to IMF staff after an affair with a subordinate became public in 2008. ||||| NEW YORK/PARIS (Reuters) - IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn was charged on Sunday with trying to rape a New York hotel maid in a scandal that appeared to wreck his hopes of becoming France's next president. \n \n The sexual assault charges throw the IMF into a leadership crisis just as it is trying to help ease an escalating euro zone debt crisis, and they turn France's presidential election campaign upside down when polls had made Strauss-Kahn a clear front runner. \n \n The charismatic 62-year-old, who led the International Monetary Fund through the 2007-09 global financial meltdown and has been central in galvanizing Europe to tackle its debt woes, for long had the reputation of a womanizer. But the charges he faces are in another realm. \n \n A maid, 32, said he emerged naked from the bathroom and sexually assaulted her inside his $3,000-a-night suite at the Sofitel hotel in New York's Times Square on Saturday afternoon. He was there on private business, the IMF said. \n \n Strauss-Kahn was expected to go before a state court later on Sunday. His lawyer said he will plead not guilty. \n \n Police say he fled the hotel after the alleged assault and a few hours later they pulled him out of his first-class seat on an Air France plane 10 minutes before it was to take off for Paris. \n \n He was charged with a criminal sexual act, unlawful imprisonment and attempted rape, moving him from luxurious hotel suite and a glittering public career to scandal and a bare holding cell in New York's tough Harlem neighborhood in the space of a few hours. \n \n The contrast could barely have been more dramatic. At the Sofitel, Strauss-Kahn's suite had a conference room, living room, foyer, spacious marble bathroom and a bedroom with a sumptuous king-sized bed and feather and down duvet. \n \n Police say Strauss-Kahn does not have diplomatic immunity from the charges, which if proven could carry a prison sentence of 15-20 years. They have collected DNA evidence from the hotel suite, The New York Times reported. \n \n Strauss-Kahn has hired New York lawyer Benjamin Brafman, a seasoned defense attorney famed for striking deals or winning not-guilty verdicts for pop stars and a football player. \n \n The IMF chief's wife, well-known French television personality Anne Sinclair, jumped to her husband's defense. \n \n \"I do not believe for a single second the accusations leveled against my husband,\" she said in a statement.. \n \n IMF CRISIS, ELECTION 'THUNDERBOLT' \n \n The IMF tried to fill its leadership vacuum by naming its No. 2 official, John Lipsky, as acting managing director. But the charges against Strauss-Kahn are a huge embarrassment for an institution that oversees the global economic system and has authorized hundreds of billions of dollars of lending to troubled countries as well as playing a major role in the euro-zone debt crisis. \n \n The allegations immediately threw France's presidential race wide open. \n \n He had not yet declared his candidacy but Strauss-Kahn was widely expected to run for the Socialist Party and early opinion polls showed him with a big lead over the conservative incumbent, Nicolas Sarkozy, who is seeking a second term at the election next April. \n \n \"The news we received from New York last night struck like a thunderbolt,\" said Socialist leader Martine Aubry, appealing for party unity. \n \n France's government as well as Strauss-Kahn's political allies and rivals called for caution and respect for the presumption of innocence, but his presidential ambitions appeared to be dead in the water unless the case against him quickly unravels and he is shown to be innocent. \n \n \"All this is completely astounding, immensely troubling and distressing. If the facts prove true ... it's something degrading for all women. It's terrible for the image of France,\" said Francois Bayrou, a centrist opponent. \n \n Far-right leader Marine Le Pen said her rival's presidential hopes had been crushed. \n \n Christine Boutin, president of the Christian Democrat Party, suggested Strauss-Kahn may have been set up. \n \n \"I think it's very likely a trap was set for Dominique Strauss-Kahn and he fell into it,\" she told France's BFM television. \"It's a political bomb for domestic politics.\" \n \n French voters are famously tolerant of political leaders' extra-marital affairs but the allegations against Strauss-Kahn are entirely different, and much more serious. \n \n If they are proven, Strauss-Kahn's fall from power in a scandal would be one of the most dramatic of any high-profile international figure in decades. \n \n Many politicians have fallen after being caught in extra-marital affairs and others have survived them, including former presidents John F. Kennedy and Bill Clinton as well as former French President Francois Mitterrand. \n \n But rarely have senior figures faced brutal assault charges like those filed against Strauss-Kahn. \n \n With Strauss-Kahn in the dock, the IMF also now faces many questions of its own, because his character had been questioned before. \n \n In 2008, Strauss-Kahn apologized for \"an error of judgment\" after an affair with a female IMF economist who was his subordinate. \n \n The Fund's board of member countries warned him against further improper conduct, but cleared him of harassment and abuse of power and kept him in his job. It will now face new scrutiny over whether that response was too weak, especially as there have been persistent rumors about Strauss-Kahn making sexual advances to women. \n \n PIVOTAL IN EUROPE'S DEBT WOES \n \n An economics professor and former French finance minister, Strauss-Kahn took over the IMF in November 2007 for a five-year term, and won praise for helping galvanize leaders to inject billions of dollars into the world economy during the global financial crisis. \n \n He introduced sweeping changes to ensure vulnerable countries swamped by the crisis had access to emergency loans, and others to give major emerging market countries such as China, India and Brazil greater voting powers in the IMF. \n \n Witty, multi-lingual, a skilled public speaker and sharp back-room negotiator, Strauss-Kahn also weighed into thornier issues by urging China to let its currency rise in a dispute with the United States. \n \n A crisis of leadership at the Fund now will especially worry European nations given Strauss-Kahn's pivotal role in brokering bailouts for Iceland, Hungary, Greece, Ireland and Portugal. \n \n \"The chances are the successor won't be a European, and will want to rebalance the IMF's priorities away from its massive commitment in Europe,\" said Jean Pisani-Ferry, director of the Bruegel economic think-tank. \n \n Strauss-Kahn had been due to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Sunday and join euro zone finance ministers on Monday to discuss the bloc's debt crisis and how to handle Greece, which is struggling to meet the terms of a 110 billion euro European Union/IMF bailout last year. \n \n \"This might definitely cause some delays in the short term,\" a Greek official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. \n \n Strauss-Kahn's lawyers moved quickly to cast doubts on the allegations against him. \n \n \"We must wait until things settle and see if it's true or a provocation,\" said one of his France-based lawyers, Leon Lef Forster. \"We must be especially careful not to get into a media circus and we must wait until things are clear.\" \n \n Brafman, his U.S. lawyer, previously defended pop star Michael Jackson against child molestation charges as well as other celebrities in trouble. \n \n The maid who accused Strauss-Kahn told police he attacked her when she went in to clean his suite. \n \n \"She told detectives he came out of the bathroom naked, ran down a hallway to the foyer where she was, pulled her into a bedroom and began to sexually assault her, according to her account,\" New York police spokesman Paul Browne said. \n \n \"She pulled away from him and he dragged her down a hallway into the bathroom where he engaged in a criminal sexual act, according to her account to detectives. He tried to lock her into the hotel room.\" \n \n The woman, who has not been named, was treated in hospital for minor injuries, Browne said. She has worked at the hotel for three years and the property's manager said on Sunday she has been a \"completely satisfactory\" employee in her work and her behavior. \n \n Under New York state law, attempted rape and criminal sexual act both carry a potential sentence of 15-20 years. Unlawful imprisonment carries a potential sentence of three to five years.",

President-elect of the International AIDS Society, Chris Beyrer, expressed \"sincere sadness\" at the news that \"colleagues and friends\" were on board the flight on the way to the 20th International AIDS Conference in Melbourne. \"The IAS is hearing unconfirmed reports that some of our friends and colleagues were on board the flight and if that is the case this is a truly sad day.\" \"The IAS has also heard reports that among the passengers was a former IAS president Joep Lange and if that is the case then the HIV/AIDS movement has truly lost a giant.\" Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said she understood a number of the victims were heading to the AIDS conference, but she had no further details. \n \n Greens Senator Christine Milne expressed her shock at such a loss to the HIV-AIDS community. \u2018\u2018The ramifications go to all the people who are at that conference this weekend and no doubt as more details emerge this tragedy will touch many, many Australians,\u2019\u2019 she told the Senate.

Detectives have sought out dental records, fingerprints and DNA material where it is available, and assembled it all into a so-called ante-mortem file that is available to compare with the remains stored in Hilversum. \n \n \"There are many victims,\" Krasziewski said. \"We don't know the state of the victims; we have to look at what they bring us tomorrow, and then we will see.\" \n \n 19.47 The United States will release intelligence backing its assertion the Malaysian airliner that crashed in Ukraine was brought down by a missile fired from the separatist-controlled area, the State Department told Reuters. \n \n Spokesman Marie Harf told reporters the intelligence community would later in the day \"be further declassifying information and will be putting out additional information that supports what we have said.\" \n \n Harf repeated the U.S. belief that the plane, with nearly 300 people on board, was shot down by a Russian-made SA-11 ground-to-air missile fired from an area controlled by separatists close to the Russian border in eastern Ukraine. \n \n 19.25 The delivery of French Mistral-class warships to Russia would be \"completely inappropriate\" given the West's misgivings about Moscow's role in Ukraine, the United States said according to AFP. \n \n We don't think anyone should be providing arms to Russia,\" deputy State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf told reporters, adding that US officials had voiced their concern over the deal in recent days to French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius. \n \n 19.22 Michael Bociurkiw told Reuters all recovery efforts seem to have ended but that at the site his group saw a plastic bag with some human remains left behind while Malaysian experts noticed a strong smell indicating the likely presence of more remains in another spot. \n \n \"We've never really seen that intensive combing over the site - people arm in arm going over the fields,\" Bociurkiw said, adding there was effectively no security at the site and that so far only a small number of international experts visited it. \n \n 19.06 According to BuzzFeed, Russia Today, the Kremlin-backed news channel, is to be investigated for violating broadcasting regulations on accuracy and impartiality during its coverage of the MH17 air crash. \n \n Ofcom told the news organisation it was considering whether to investigate the matter further after getting complaints from viewers about RT's tone. \n \n Anna Belkina, head of communications at Russia Today told BuzzFeed: \u201cWhile we would love to provide the details of our communication with Ofcom and the facts and arguments that RT had presented to the regulator in support of our position, we cannot do so as it would violate the regulator\u2019s rules. \n \n \u201cIt is sad that the news media of the US and the UK, which has always prided itself on its commitment to asking hard questions of its own government when it comes to domestic politics, in this particular situation is readily swallowing up the \u2018party line\u2019 of the Department of State and the Foreign Office, demanding no proof of their claims.\" \n \n It comes after Sara Firth resigned from the channel last week in protest against the way the channel covered the crash. \n \n 18.57 The twin sister of a British man who was killed in the Malaysia Airlines tragedy on Thursday has said she does not feel bitter towards those who caused his death, Nick Collins reports. \n \n Tracey Withers, 49, said she did not want to become \u201cbitter or twisted\u201d over the loss of her brother Glenn Thomas, a media officer for the World Health Organisation. \n \n She told the BBC she had not been thinking about who was responsible for bringing down flight MH17 over Ukraine, amid the widespread belief it was shot down by a missile. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m trying not to get too involved in how I feel about what they\u2019ve done because I don\u2019t want it to eat me up inside,\u201d she said. \n \n \u201cI just want to grieve and carry on the way my brother would want our family to carry on as he was such a big personality.\u201d \n \n She said her family had stayed positive after the recent loss of her father, and that Mr Thomas would have wanted them to do the same after his death. \n \n However, she added that her brother\u2019s partner was feeling \u201clost\u201d and that her family would fly to Geneva on Wednesday to support him. \n \n 18.54 Kiev has launched a criminal investigation against Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and a shadowy Muscovite millionaire for organising and financing \"illegal armed groups\" in Ukraine, AFP reports. \n \n The investigation comes just over a month after Russia launched an investigation of its own against Ukraine's Interior Minister Arsen Avakov and a billionaire local governor over the killings of civilians and journalists in conflict-torn east Ukraine. \n \n Avakov, who announced the move against the two Russians, said in a statement that Shoigu is suspected of having organised the \"illegal armed groups on Ukrainian territory\". \n \n Avakov added that insurgents \"commanded by Russian citizens, systematically carried out armed attacks against\" Ukrainian authorities, \"causing loss of life, destruction and other serious consequences.\" \n \n Russian nationalist Konstantin Malofeev - an enigmatic investment banker with ties to some of the leading rebels fighting in Ukraine - was accused of having financed the pro-Moscow militias. \n \n 18.44 Dutch PM Mr Rutte declares Wednesday a national day of mourning, Dutch media is saying, reports Harriet Alexander. \n \n Tomorrow when the bodies arrive at Eindhoven, those attending will include Dutch King Willem-Alexander, Queen Maxima, PM Rutte, Deputy PM Asscher, and representatives of countries. \n \n According to Michael van Poppel, MH17 victims are expected to arrive at Eindhoven Airport at around 4 p.m. local time and before their arrival, there will be a nationwide 5-minute bell ringing. \n \n When they arrive, it will be marked by bugle call, followed by a minute of silence. \n \n Twitter: Michael van Poppel - Declaration of national day of mourning in the Netherlands is the first since 1962, when former Queen Wilhelmina died \n \n Twitter: Michael van Poppel - As part of the day of national mourning, Dutch PM Rutte has instructed flags to be flown at half mast throughout the country \n \n 18.36 OSCE has told Reuters human remains can be still be seen at the crash site as recovery efforts appear halted. \n \n \"We observed the presence of smaller body parts at the site,\" an OSCE spokesman, Michael Bociurkiw, told a briefing in Ukraine's eastern city of Donetsk after his group inspected the site earlier in the day. \n \n \"We did not observe any recovery activity in place.\" \n \n 18.34 Alexei Kudrin, a former Russian finance minister and loyal ally of President Vladimir Putin, warned anti-Western rhetoric during the Ukrainian crisis could isolate the nation and derail its modernisation, Reuters reports. \n \n In rare high-level criticism of growing Kremlin conservatism, Kudrin said Moscow should not intervene militarily in the rebellion in eastern Ukraine and expressed dismay that Russians were as once again becoming adversaries of the West. \n \n Kudrin, who repaired state finances after the chaos of the 1990s, told ITAR-TASS news agency that Russia risked taking a dangerous path internationally. \n \n 18.32 The president of the former Soviet republic of Lithuania, now an EU member, has accused France of pursuing a policy akin to the 1930s appeasement of Nazi Germany over its decision to go ahead with the delivery of a helicopter carrier to Moscow, Reuters said. \n \n 18.29 Turkish Airlines said via Twitter Dnepropetrovsk flights were cancelled until July 24. \n \n Twitter: Turkish Airlines - Our Dnepropetrovsk flights have been cancelled until July 24th due to current conditions affecting Ukrainian airspace. \n \n 18.23 When Obama visited the Dutch embassy in Washington, Raf Sanchez reports he left the following message in a book of condolences: \n \n On behalf of the American people, I extend our deepest condolences to the people of the Netherlands as they mourn the loss of so many family and friends. \n \n No words can adequately express the sorrow the world feels over this loss. It is made more acute by the deep ties of friendship between our two countries. \n \n Bound by that friendship, we will not rest until we are certain that justice is done. \n \n God Bless, Barack Obama \n \n 18.13 Nick Collins has more information about the black box and the British investigators who will retrieve the data. \n \n Officials would not confirm when they expected to receive the black box and voice recorder but Mark Rutte, the Dutch Prime Minister, said they had been on board a train carrying the bodies of victims which arrived in Kharkiv, which is controlled by the Ukrainian government, at 10.30am on Tuesday. \n \n Britain was asked to retrieve the data because Farnborough is one of only two facilities in Europe with the capability to do so, sources said. \n \n David Barry, an air accident investigation expert at Cranfield University, said the complexity of the process would depend on how much damage the two data recorders had sustained, although images suggest they are in good condition. \n \n \u201cThey look reasonably intact so I would certainly expect [investigators] to be able to get data off them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey do not look like they have been stuck in fire for 12 hours.\u201d \n \n In the best case scenario the recorders can simply be plugged into a computer and their data downloaded in binary form, before being converted by software into meaningful readings on the aircraft\u2019s speed, altitude and other variables, he explained. \n \n If the recorders have sustained damage experts will have to open them up and retrieve the circuit boards inside. If these are intact the data can be retrieved without too much difficulty, but if they too are compromised each memory chip will need to be individually examined \u2013 a process which could take weeks or even months. \n \n It remains possible that separatists could have downloaded data from the recorders since recovering them several days ago, but any tampering would be immediately obvious, he added. \n \n 18.09 The National Forensic Investigation Team (LTFO) will be in charge of identification, with 150 experts from defence, police, firefighters and dentists, forensic anthropologists and detection experts, Ben Farmer in Donetsk and Harriet Alexander in Amsterdam report. \n \n Family members had also all been asked to give DNA samples to assist in the identification of the bodies. \n \n Hundreds of people are expected to join a candlelit procession through central Amsterdam, described as a \u201cSilent Walk,\u201d to remember the victims tonight. \n \n Peter van Lent, who organised the march, said he wanted people to wear something white and join the procession. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s in memory of those who died,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd to support their relatives at this terrible time.\u201d \n \n 17.49 The verdict in Washington on the statement by EU foreign ministers on the MH17 crisis is basically a reserved judgment, Peter Foster says. \n \n While the actual measures outlined by the EU are described as \"feeble\" by a senior official, the White House is taking some encouragement in the EU's promise to look at \"capital markets, defence, dual use goods, and sensitive technologies, including in the energy sector\". \n \n If the EU did adopt these kinds of measures, this would bring Europe much more closely into line with the sanctions announced in by the Obama administration on Wednesday last week, a day before MH17 was shot down. \n \n The question is whether what one senior US official called \"genuine European outrage\" over the downing of MH17 will translate into real action on Europe's part. \"Right now, we think it's a coin flip,\" according to my source. \n \n Meanwhile the US is continuing to debate the merits of tightening its own sanctions further, but imminent developments are not expected on that front, at least until European intentions have become clearer. \n \n 17.46 The United States says it is preparing to present data from the U.S. intelligence community laying out what's known about the Malaysia Airlines plane that was shot down in Ukraine, AP reports. \n \n White House spokesman Josh Earnest says the intelligence community will have some additional data to present. No additional details about what would be released were available. \n \n Earnest said the U.S. welcomes the news that most of the remains of the 298 killed have been handed over to authorities and the black boxes were transferred to Dutch and Malaysian authorities. \n \n But he says the U.S. still hasn't seen the level of cooperation from Russia and pro-Russian separatists that it wants to see. Earnest says international investigators led by the Dutch still need full and immediate access to the crash site. \n \n Keyword BC-US--United States-Ukraine-Evidence \n \n 17.38 The airport at Eindhoven is preparing for the arrival of the first bodies from Ukraine - although there is no sign yet that any planes have left Ukraine, Harriet Alexander reports. \n \n Plane spotters and journalists are positioned on the roof of the parking lot. Since this morning, television crews from Reuters and AP have also been there. \n \n Albert Bos, a Dutch journalist, tweeted this picture of himself at the airport, with the caption (translated): \"Live at half past seven from Eindhoven, where tomorrow victims of the plane crash will begin in stages to arrive back.\" \n \n Twitter: Albert Bos - Om half 7 live vanaf vliegbasis Eindhoven waar vanaf morgen de slachtoffers van vliegramp in fases terugkomen. #OB http://t.co/8pUF9XkD6P \n \n 17.32 Aviation expert David Barry explains how a black box works after a Telegraph video team filmed at Cranfield University today. \n \n 17.26 An Interpol team has now begun identifying victims of Flight MH17, Reuters reports. \n \n 17.22 The latest EU demands say Russia must: stop the flow of weapons to eastern Ukraine; withdraw its \"additional troops\" from the Ukrainian border, use its influence on pro-Russian separatists to grant international investigators full access to the crash site of flight MH17; and fully co-operate with the probe, Martin Banks reports. \n \n According to the ministers\u2019 conclusions, the EU \"remains ready to introduce without delay a package of further significant restrictive measures, if full and and immediate co-operation on the above mentioned demands fails to materialise.\" \n \n The Brussels based news website EUObserver reported the exact proposals are to be tabled at a meeting of EU ambassadors in Brussels on Thursday. \n \n 17.19 EU foreign ministers have given Russia a few days to stop arming Ukrainian rebels or face sanctions on its financial, high-tech and defence industries, Martin Banks reports. \n \n At a highly-charged meeting on Tuesday, they also decided to add more names and companies to an existing blacklist, which are to be agreed by the end of July. \n \n Speaking after the ministerial meeting in Brussels, Dutch foreign minister Frans Timmermans said: \"This [the new EU threat] is a logical consequence ... of the lack of progress that we have seen on the Russian side\" since a previous ultimatum ran out at the end of June.\" \n \n He said he was happy for the solidarity expressed by his colleagues and that the \"decision was reached unanimously.\" \n \n 17.12 Britain wants to impose sanctions on the friends and allies of Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin to pressure Russia to stop meddling in Ukraine, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said. \n \n Mr Hammond said EU foreign ministers had agreed to look at an embargo on new arms sales to Russia and to look at the possibility of restricting Russian access to capital markets, financial services and to high-technology equipment used in the energy sector. \n \n \"The word is 'cronies': the cronies of Mr Putin and his clique in the Kremlin are the people who have to bear the pressure. If the financial interests of the group around the leadership are affected, the leadership will know about it. \n \n \"We are looking at individuals who contribute to, in one way or another, the regime in the Kremlin and its interference in Ukraine and Crimea or who have benefited from the decisions and actions of that regime. \n \n 17.08 More from the White House spokesman Josh Earnest who said international investigators still need \"immediate and full access\" to the site of the Malaysia Airlines plane crash in eastern Ukraine, Reuters reports. \n \n He said the United States welcomed news victims' remains were being transferred to the Netherlands but said: \"I don't think we've seen yet the level of cooperation with international investigators that we'd like to see.\" \n \n President Barack Obama visited the Netherlands Embassy today to sign a condolence book honoring victims of last Thursday's crash. \n \n He said he wanted to \"assure the Dutch people we will work with them to ensure that loved ones are recovered, that a proper investigation is conducted and that ultimately justice is done.\" \n \n 17.04 The Kremlin has said that Vladimir Putin had a telephone conversation with Dutch PM Mark Rutte in a statement, Harriet Alexander reports. \n \n The discussion focussed on the practical implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 2166, adopted on July 21 in support of efforts to arrange a comprehensive, thorough and independent international investigation of the accident with the Malaysian airlines jet that took place on July 17 in Donetsk region. \n \n 17.03 The Red Cross has made a confidential legal assessment that Ukraine is officially in a war, Western diplomats and officials say, opening the door to possible war crimes prosecutions, including over the downing of Malaysia Airlines MH-17. \n \n \"Clearly it's an internal conflict and therefore this is most probably a war crime,\" one Western diplomat in Geneva told Reuters. \n \n It comes after Dutch prosecutors opened an investigation into the crash on suspicion of murder, war crimes and intentionally downing an airliner. \n \n 17.00 Meanwhile Reuters say the United States is continuing to review its sanctions on Russia amid the conflict in Ukraine, including the downed Malaysian airliner shot down last week, and is willing to consider additional costs, the White House said. \n \n The United States also would welcome additional steps to impose costs on Russia, particularly from Europe, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters. \n \n \"Our willingness to consider adding additional costs is something that continues to be a live option,\" Earnest said. \n \n 16.59 Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the UK wanted 'cronies' around Putin to bear the pressure of sanctions, according to Reuters. \n \n 16.55 The full conclusions of the Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Brussels today can be read here. \n \n But they are not likely to satisfy not the United States and more hawkish members of the EU, including Poland and the Baltic states, who lobbied for tough sanctions against the Russian economy. \n \n In their conclusions, the ministers said they would only ask the 28-nation bloc's executive arm to prepare for more forceful economic sanctions - including targeting the arms, energy and financial sectors. \n \n 16.38 It was revealed by Cameron that air accident investigators in Farnborough will retrieve data from the black boxes and we have more updates from our transport correspondent, Nick Collins via Twitter. \n \n Twitter: Nick Collins - AAIB experts at Farnborough will receive black box from #MH17 and could produce results within 24 hours of receipt, DfT says \n \n Twitter: Nick Collins - Experts who have seen images of the #MH17 black box say it looks reasonably intact and high hopes data will be recoverable \n \n They will not publish their findings but will pass them on to Dutch authorities, who will then decide what information can be released, AP reports. \n \n 16.33 According to the BBC, Mr Timmermans said the list of Russian individuals and groups covered by EU sanctions will be broadened and a new list drawn up by EU ambassadors by Thursday at the latest. \n \n 16.30 AP report that German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said: \"Russia has not done enough to contribute to a de-escalation of the conflict.\" \n \n 16.05 Dutch Foreign Minister Frans Timmermans said the EU's \"forceful decision\" imposes visa bans and asset freezes on more officials deemed responsible for Russia's actions in Ukraine., AP reports. \n \n He says the ministers also asked the 28-nation bloc's executive arm to prepare for more forceful economic sanctions - including targeting the arms, energy and financial sectors - if Russia fails to back down from destabilising Ukraine. \n \n Timmerman did not specify how many officials were targeted under the latest sanctions, nor did he reveal their names. \n \n European foreign ministers stopped short, at least for now, of more forceful sanctions that would hit full sectors of the Russian economy. \n \n 16.03 It was revealed by the press office of the European Council the foreign ministers approved a decision to send a police mission to Ukraine as part of the EU's Common Security and Defense Policy, Martin Banks in Brussels reports. \n \n One well placed EU source said that several EU foreign ministers are believed to be also pushing for an arms embargo against Russia \n \n Meanwhile, Briton Nick Witney, of the European Council on Foreign Relations and former chief executive of the European Defence Agency, says the Ukraine crisis is a \"long-overdue wake-up call\". \n \n Writing on the Brussels-based Euractiv.com website he says Europe\u2019s leaders have \"not rushed\" to respond to America\u2019s calls for increased defence spending and would rather confront Russia as they did in the 20th century \u2013 \"from under America\u2019s protective wing.\" \n \n 15.58 Dutch minister says EU is imposing new sanctions on officials over Russia's actions in Ukraine, AP reports. \n \n 15.45 Maja Kocijan\u010di\u010d, spokesman for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy of the EU led by High Representative/Vice-President Catherine Ashton, has said on Twitter that foreign ministers adopted \"strong conclusions on Ukraine\". \n \n Twitter: Maja Kocijan\u00c4\u008di\u00c4\u008d - #EU Foreign Ministers adopted strong conclusions on #Ukraine in wake of downing of #MH17. Text available soon at http://t.co/ycxrbnwAYH. \n \n 15.25 The Prime Minister, David Cameron, has tweeted air accident investigators at Farnborough will retrieve data from #MH17 black boxes for international analysis. \n \n Twitter: David Cameron - We've agreed Dutch request for air accident investigators at Farnborough to retrieve data from #MH17 black boxes for international analysis. \n \n The UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB), based in Farnborough, southern England, is part of the Department for Transport and is responsible for the investigation of civil aircraft accidents and serious incidents. \n \n 15.16 Mortar blasts rocked the outskirts of rebel stronghold Donetsk as Ukrainian soldiers clashed again with pro-Russian insurgents a day after five civilians were reported killed by shelling in the area, AFP reports. \n \n AFP reporters heard artillery fire coming from the Ukrainian side in the village of Oktyabrsky close to the airport, which has now come under full government control. \n \n Around 30 rebels - some in balaclavas or black pirate-style bandanas - immediately raised their Kalashnikov rifles into firing position and asked reporters to leave. \n \n 15.09 EU governments are discussing the possibility of imposing capital restrictions on Russia if it does not coopoerate on the plane crash investigation, diplomats tell Reuters. \n \n 15.07 Malaysia's Transport Minister, Liow Tiong Lai has issued a statement in response to the arrival of bodies at Kharkiv. \n \n We are relieved that the train has safely arrived at Kharkiv about 11am local time. This is an important milestone in relation to the MH17 tragedy. \n \n Malaysia sent 18 DVI personnel to Kharkiv to assist in the tagging and transfer of bodies to the plane, I have been briefed that the forensics team and relevant support teams will now have to undergo a process that will take a few hours prior to the remains being flown off to Amsterdam. \n \n We still need to get to the truth of what has happened and we hope for the investigators to commence their work at the crash site to determine this. \n \n Families are suffering across the world and once the remains are with the respective families, I am sure they will demand for justice to be served on those who have caused this horrific crime. \n \n 15.00 Diplomats have told Reuters possible new EU sanctions could include measures in the defence sector, energy technology and dual-use goods. \n \n The news comes as Ukraine's parliament approved a presidential decree to call up more military reserves and men under 50 to fight rebels in eastern Ukraine and defend the border against a concentration of troops in Russia. \n \n \"Russia continues its policy of escalating its armed confrontation,\" Ukraine's top security official, Andriy Parubiy, told parliament before 232 deputies in the 450-seat parliament voted in favour of the decree. \n \n 14.50 A top security aide to Putin accused the Ukrainian authorities of being henchman who were taking orders from the West, acccording to Reuters. \n \n \"The West's henchman came to power (in February) and have now, in my opinion, lost some of their sovereignty, independence in decision-making and are acting under orders,\" Nikolai Patrushev told Putin. \n \n 14.44 Reuters reports Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, working through intermediaries to reach rebel leader Alexander Borodai, was a key figure in brokering the deal to get the black boxes, according to two sources in Malaysia with direct knowledge of the negotiations. \n \n The talks were kept under tight wraps, with Mr Razak initiating the conversation and bringing only a handful of his closest confidants into the discussions. \n \n \"It was the Prime Minister's project,\" one of the sources said. \n \n \"He was the main player and he kept this within a very, very, very tight circle. Even some of his closest advisers were not part of this circle, and were surprised by this deal.\" \n \n 14.35 Tributes continue to be paid to the victims of MH17 at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport as the thick carpet of flowers keeps on growing, Harriet Alexander reports. \n \n A little boy has just turned up with his mother - wearing an oversized pilot's hat, which dwarfed his small head. They stood and looked at the piles of sunflowers, roses and cuddly toys, hugging each other silently. \n \n A team of airport workers have also just been to visit and lay flowers. \n \n Many people simply stand by the railings in tears, reading the tributes. \n \n 14.23 Meanwhile ABC News reports Michael Bociurkiw, a spokesman for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe told its reporters that the wreckage from the plane had been \"significantly altered\". \n \n According to Mr Bociurkiw, major pieces of the front of the plane appear to have been cut away. \n \n The investigators also observed an individual cutting into the wreckage using power tools, ABC News reported. \n \n 14.18 European Union governments will discuss a specific list of possible new targets for Russia sanctions on Thursday, but will make no decisions at Tuesday's meeting of EU foreign ministers, diplomats told Reuters. \n \n EU foreign ministers met in Brussels today to discuss their response to the downing of the flight, and any new sanctions to be imposed against Moscow over the crisis in the former Soviet republic. \n \n \"There will be no names for the sanction list today,\" one EU diplomat said. \"The European Commission will propose new names for (discussion) on Thursday.\" \n \n 14.15 Meanwhile in France, Harriet Alexander says the website of Franceinfo television analyses how sanctions could be implemented - and what impact they would have on France. \n \n President Francois Hollande has said that the first of two Mistral warships ordered by Russia would be delivered - because the contract was signed in 2011, the ship is almost ready to be delivered, and if France reneges on the contract they will have to reimburse Russia to the tune of over a billion euros. But on the second warship, Mr Hollande is less emphatic. \n \n \"That will depend on the attitude of Russia,\" he said on Monday evening. \"I have stated that very clearly. But at the moment, no sanctions have been decided which would force us to renounce the deal.\" \n \n A French government source told the website that sanctions which would prevent the delivery of the warship were not currently on the table. \"France for now wants the sanctions to be financial, targeted and rapid,\" said a source close to Mr Hollande. \n \n 14.12 Dmitri Rogozine, the Russian deputy prime minister, has spoken of his doubts about whether France will have to do a u-turn on selling warships to the country, Harriet Alexander reports. \n \n The deputy prime minister has said he doubts France will be pressured into reneging on the deal to sell warships to Russia. \n \n \"We're talking about billions of euros,\" he said. \n \n \"France is very practical and I doubt that the delivery will be cancelled.\" And he added: \"The cancellation of the order would be a lot less damaging to Russia than it would be to France.\" \n \n 13.46 AFP reports the Ukraine interior ministry has said its forces have gained control over the strategically important town of Severodonetsk from pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine. \n \n Ukraine's security forces were in control of \"all the vital facilities\" in the city of around 110,000, located roughly 120 kilometres (75 miles) to the north of the key rebel stronghold of Donetsk, the ministry said in a statement. \n \n 13.43 Putin has vowed to do everything possible to influence pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine and help ensure a full investigation into the crash, according to AP and Russian agencies. He told a meeting of Russia's national security council: \n \n Russia will do everything in its power for a full, comprehensive, deep, and transparent investigation. We are asked to exert influence on the militants of the south-east (of Ukraine). Of course we will do everything in our power.\" \n \n 13.20 The Dutch prime minister has been giving details of the next stage in the journey of the 298 bodies to their final resting place. Harriet Alexander reports: \n \n Mark Rutte said that the bodies, travelling in a refrigerated train from Donetsk, had arrived in Kharkiv - where Dutch Air Force planes were waiting. \n \n The Hercules C-130 planes would, early tomorrow morning, begin flying the bodies back to Eindhoven in the Netherlands. The operation would be done in phases, he said. \n \n And from there they would be taken to the military base at Hilversum, near Amsterdam. \n \n But he warned not to expect immediate release of the bodies to the families. \n \n \"Identification of bodies can sometimes happen fast, but might in some cases take weeks or months,\" he said. \n \n 12.42 Hillary Clinton last night called for the US and Europe to work together to develop tougher sanctions against Russia. AP reports: \n \n Clinton said in a Facebook chat from the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, that tougher sanctions would make clear to Russian President Vladimir Putin \"that there is a price to pay for this kind of behavior.\" The former secretary of state said she agreed with Obama's comments earlier Monday urging \"immediate and full access\" for investigators combing through the wreckage of the downed plane. \n \n \"We should do more to ensure a thorough investigation that not only respects those who were murdered in the attack on the plane, but also tries to find answers to who is responsible,\" Clinton wrote during the question-and-answer session on the popular social media site. \n \n 12.32 Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, has not shown the same resolve to slap sanctions on Russia as David Cameron has, reports Harriet Alexander. \n \n While Rutte has been outspoken about the treatment of the bodies and the urgency for them to be returned to their families, he has only suggested further retaliation if Putin blocks repatriation. \n \n Yesterday he said in parliament that their priority was returning the bodies - skirting the sanction issue somewhat. \n \n But the NRC newspaper here puts it more bluntly. Their front page today shows Putin and Rutte with the headline: \"Time for a break?\" \n \n De Telegraaf, a leading newspaper in the Netherlands, shows King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima, with the headline: \"We're not letting go of each other.\" \n \n Below the fold of the page, their reporter writes of \"tensions over the release of the bodies\" and tells of \"goosebumps on seeing the crash site.\" \n \n 12.26 Tony Abbott, Australia\u2019s prime minister, has called for a multinational force to be deployed to the MH17 crash site in Ukraine to put an end to an attempted cover-up and \u201cevidence tampering on an industrial scale\u201d. Jonathan Pearlman reports \n \n Tony Abbott, Australia\u2019s prime minister, has called for a multinational force to be deployed to the MH17 crash site in Ukraine to put an end to an attempted cover-up and \u201cevidence tampering on an industrial scale\u201d. \n \n Condemning the disturbing scenes emerging from the debris field, Mr Abbott said the countries worst affected by the attack should have an opportunity to send troops to ensure the remains of victims and all evidence were recovered without interference. \n \n Australia lost 37 citizens and residents on the flight, which was carrying 298 passengers from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur; the Netherlands and Malaysia were the worst-affected nations. \n \n \u201cAfter the crime, comes the cover-up,\u201d Mr Abbott said. \n \n \u201cWhat we have seen is evidence tampering on an industrial scale and obviously that has to stop. A multinational police force, or a multinational force of some kind, is not something that can be just summonsed up in a matter of a few hours, but obviously there does need to be security at this site.\u201d \n \n 12.14 The first bodies of MH17 victims will not arrive in the Netherlands until Wednesday, the country's prime minister has announced. \n \n \"Tomorrow the first plane [with bodies] will leave for Eindhoven,\" in the southern Netherlands, Mark Rutte told journalists after the bodies arrived in Ukraine's Kharkiv from rebel-held territory. \n \n 12.10 With the tacit approval of Malaysia's leaders, hundreds of protestors have gathered outside the Russian embassy in Kuala Lumpur to demand justice and action from Moscow. Tom Phillips reports from Malaysia: \n \n Demonstrators descended on the tree-lined Russian embassy in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday afternoon carrying banners that read: \u201cCan we trust Russia to tell the truth?\u201d, \u201cPresident Putin, we demand justice\u201d and \u201cGenocide at 33,000ft\u201d. \n \n \u201cWe don\u2019t want any more cover up about this matter. The whole nation wants to know the real story,\u201d Armand Azha Abu Hanifah, one of the organisers, told The Telegraph. \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d \n \n \u201cI believe they are trying to hide something and that is why we are here today,\u201d said Mohamad Kassim Ali, a 50 year-old, who was one of perhaps 300 protesters outside the embassy compound. \n \n The organisers, members of the youth wing of Unmo, Malaysia\u2019s ruling party, insisted their demonstration was not political. \n \n Yet having received tacit support from Malaysia\u2019s leaders the protest was precisely that. Black-clad demonstrators came on specially chartered coaches to send Moscow the message that Malaysia\u2019s politicians have so far felt unable to publicly deliver themselves. \n \n \u201cMr Putin should do more than just talk,\u201d said Ibdilillah Ishak, a 38-year-old youth wing organiser. \u201cIt has taken them four days to actually do something. Are they hiding the truth? What is going on? Why are they hiding the truth?\u201d \n \n \u201cTo me, this is a genocide of 298 people at 33,000 feet,\u201d Mr Ishak added. \u201cWho will fight for them, if not the Malaysians right now?\u201d \n \n 11.51 The EU is compromimsing its values in order to protect its trade ties with Russia, Lithuania's president has suggested, as EU foreign ministers meet in Brussels to decide whether to strengthen sanctions against Moscow over the MH17 disaster. \n \n \"We see the Mistralisation of European policy,\" Dalia Grybauskaite said earlier today, referring to a 1.2 billion euro ($1.6 billion) deal to supply Russia with two French Mistral warships. \n \n Values and security are undermined for the sake of business, when 'buy and rule' is being applied... \n \n The sale of military technology to Russia the under current circumstances cannot be tolerated... \n \n Nazism was not stopped in the 1930s, and we now we see great-Russia chauvinism which leads to things like an attack against a civilian airliner \n \n Those who organised, ordered and supplied weapons must be held responsible, before the Hague Tribunal \n \n \n \n Dalia Grybauskaite, Lithuania\u2019s President (GETTY) \n \n 11.33 Colin Brazier, the Sky News journalist who came under fire for picking up MH17 victims' luggage live on air, has apologised for his \"error of judgement. \n \n Writing in the Guardian, Mr Brazier said: \n \n At the weekend I got things wrong. If there was someone to apologise to in person, I would. While presenting Sky's lunchtime coverage of the flight MH17 disaster, I stooped down to look at a piece of debris. It was a child's suitcase. I put my hand inside and lifted up a water bottle and a set of keys. As I did so my mental circuit-breaker finally engaged and I apologised instantly on-air for what I was doing. \n \n Out of the corner of my eye I spotted a pink drinking flask. It looked familiar. My six-year-old daughter, Kitty, has one just like it... \n \n Too late, I realised that I was crossing a line. \n \n 11.13 David Cameron is a hypocrite who should \"start by cleaning up his own backyard\" before lecturing France on selling military equipment to Russia, the head of Francois Hollande's ruling Socialist Party has said. \n \n Jean-Christophe Cambadelis, told i>Tele television on Tuesday: \n \n Hollande is not backing down. He is delivering the first (ship) despite the fact he is being asked not to. \n \n This is a false debate led by hypocrites ... When you see how many (Russian) oligarchs have sought refuge in London, David Cameron should start by cleaning up his own backyard. \n \n \n \n Catherine Ashton talks with Philip Hammond in Brussels (THIERRY CHARLIER/AFP/GETTY) \n \n 11.00 Philip Hammond, the new British foreign secretary, has arrived in Brussels for the meeting of EU foreign ministers to discuss a collective response to the Ukraine crisis, as well as Gaza. He said: \n \n This terrible incident happened in the first place because of Russia's support to the separatists in eastern Ukraine, because of the flow of heavy weapons from Russia into eastern Ukraine, and we have to address that issue. \n \n The world has changed since the European council last week. \n \n The events of last Thursday have changed public expectations on us and we have to send a clear signal from our meeting today that we recognise that and that we are going to go further as a consequence of what has happened. \n \n \n \n One of the two black boxes recovered from the crash site of the MH17 jet during a press conference in Donetsk (DAMIEN SIMONART/AFP/GETTY) \n \n 10.36 Harriet Alexander is in Amsterdam, where victims' families and friends are mourning their loved ones: \n \n There has been a steady stream of people coming to leave flowers outside Schiphol airport this morning. \n \n This bouquet has been left with the headline from yesterday's De Telegraaf - a newspaper here in the Netherlands. It reads: \"Give us our people back\". \n \n Some 193 of the 298 victims of the disaster were from Holland. \n \n The Dutch government has yet to announce which airport the bodies will be transferred to later on today. Schipol airport, in Amsterdam, was the point of origin of MH17's final journey. \n \n 10.28 Roland Oliphant reports from Donetsk for the Telegraph on the \"official\" handover of the MH17 black boxes to Malaysian officials, which delayed the movement of victims' corpses from the city up to Kharkiv: \n \n The train carrying both the bodies of the victims and the \u201cblack box\u201d flight recorders has arrived in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. \n \n The departure was delayed by last-minute wrangling over the handover of the black boxes, which had originally been scheduled for 9.00pm local time last night (7.00pm UK time). \n \n After several hours of closed-door negotiations, rebel prime minister Alexander Borodai finally emerged to hand over the flight recorders to Malaysian officials at 1.00am... \n \n It emerged during the handover ceremony that 282 bodies and 87 body parts were on the train. That leaves 16 casualties as yet unaccounted for. \n \n It is not clear what held up the transfer, which appears to have followed intense international diplomacy on Friday. \n \n But the rebels appear to have gone to great lengths to make the hand over as \u201cofficial\u201d as possible, summoning the international press to the headquarters of the self-declared Donetsk People\u2019s Republic to witness rebel and Malaysian officials signing protocols to confirm the transaction. \n \n The documents are of great symbolic value to the rebels because they represent the first international agreement the unrecognised \u201cRepublic\u201d has ever signed - making it the nearest the breakaway state has ever come to official recognition. \n \n 10.18 EU foreign ministers have arrived in Brussels for a meeting in which tougher, sector-level sanctions against Russia over MH17 are expected to be top of the agenda. \n \n On arrival, Germany's foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier called for tougher sanctions against the Kremlin. \n \n Germany has traditionally been seen as softer on Russia than many of its EU allies due to close energy import and manufacturing export links, but Angela Merkel is believed to have run out of patience with Vladimir Putin in recent days. \n \n 10.05 Photographs have emerged appearing to show the arrival of the refrigerated train carriages containing 282 MH17 victims' bodies at Kharkiv. \n \n The victims' corpses arrived at a train station in the Kiev-held industrial hub. \n \n They are due to be airlifted to the Netherlands later today. \n \n \n \n The train carrying the remains of the victims of Malaysia Airlines MH17 arrives in Kharkiv (Gleb Garanich/Reuters) \n \n 09.45 The French port of Saint-Nazaire is divided over the arrival of Russian sailors for training on the new warships Paris is controversially selling to the Kremlin, reports the New York Times. \n \n 09.20 A train carrying the remains of victims of a Malaysian plane downed over rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine arrived in the city of Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine, Reuters reports. \n \n Ukrainian officials say the remains will be taken to the Netherlands. Almost 300 people were killed when the Malaysian airliner went down on Thursday, most of them were Dutch. \n \n 08.48 Tributes have been laid to the victims of MH17 at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport - from which the ill-fated flight departed last Thursday. The Telegraph's Harriet Alexander reports: \n \n Outside Schiphol airport in Amsterdam, a huge carpet of flowers has been laid in memory of the 298 victims. \n \n Candles flickered among the countless bunches of roses, lilies and sunflowers - a tribute all the more poignant given that the plane crashed in a field of Ukrainian sunflowers. \n \n And as a gesture to the 80 children who lost their lives, many stuffed toys and cartoon cards were among the flowers. \n \n A queue of people lined up silently to sign a book of condolences. \n \n One woman, a KLM air stewardess, had tears pouring down her cheek as she signed the book, and placed her flowers on the pavement. She paused, then stood quickly and went to get her flight. \n \n \n \n Outside Schiphol airport in Amsterdam, a huge carpet of flowers has been laid in memory of the 298 victims (HARRIET ALEXANDER/THE TELEGRAPH) \n \n One woman, a KLM air stewardess, had tears pouring down her cheek asshe signed the book, and placed her flowers on the pavement (HARRIET ALEXANDER/THE TELEGRAPH) \n \n 08.35 American anger is growing over France's arms deal with the Kremlin, reports Peter Foster, the Telegraph's US Editor. \n \n The United States is continuing to pile pressure on France to suspend a $1.6bn (\u00a31bn) defence contract with the Russian government amid calls for Europe to adopt meaningful sanctions against Moscow following the downing of Flight MH17. \n \n As EU foreign ministers, including Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, meet in Brussels later today to discuss toughening sanctions, the French refusal to halt the contract to supply two helicopter carriers to the Russian navy has come under particular fire. \n \n The fact that France is still providing training to Russian service personnel was the subject of heated contacts between US and European officials last the weekend, officials said, as months of tension over the project came to a head. \n \n \"The Americans are absolutely furious about the French still training the Russians,\" a Western diplomatic source told The Telegraph in Washington. \"The question everyone is asking is, 'at what point does Europe draw the line?'\" \n \n 08.20 Protests are taking place outside the Russian embassy in Kuala Lumpur, reports Tom Phillips. \n \n Twitter: Tom Phillips - Protest leading shouting: 'Russia we demand an answer. 298 people have died.

At all times, MH004 was in airspace approved by ICAO,\u201d it said. \n \n Dozens of airlines previously flying over crisis-stricken eastern Ukraine abandoned the well-used route between Asia and Europe after MH17 went down with the loss of 298 lives. \n \n Previous MH4 Airbus A380s have flown over Turkey, according to air traffic tracker Flightradar24. \n \n But it posted on Twitter that Sunday\u2019s flight flew over war-torn Syria, where the conflict is raging both on the ground and in the air. \n \n Twitter: Flightradar24 - As far as we have seen #MH4 was the only transcontinental flight going over Syria. \n \n 02.40 The Financial Times have published a photograph they say offers clear evidence flight MH17 was shot down by a surface-to-air missile. Their photograph shows a piece of the downed Boeing 777 with a large hole ripped in it, smaller holes around that and with burn marks, pointing towards a missile strike as the likely cause. \n \n The wreckage was recovered by the people of Petropavlovka from a villager\u2019s back yard last Thursday and moved to the roadside because it was believed to be important. \n \n Two defence analysts in London and a former military pilot who have studied the picture corroborated the claim by a local man, who said he had served in the military, that much of the damage was consistent with a missile strike.\" \n \n MH17: FT photo shows signs of damage from missile strike \n \n 02.00 To reiterate the main news of the last few hours, a train carrying the remains of 280 people killed in the Malaysian plane disaster was finally allowed to leave the rebel-held region of eastern Ukraine as the militants also declared a truce around the crash site and handed over the black boxes from the plane, five days after the tragedy happened. \n \n Twitter: Paul Sonne - The Donetsk rebel government tweets photos of the documents it has signed with Malaysia. http://t.co/Qt1P463bU6 \n \n 00.50 Hillary Clinton believes the US and Europe should work together to develop much tougher sanctions on Russia. \n \n Clinton said in a Facebook chat that tougher sanctions would make clear to Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201cthat there is a price to pay for this kind of behaviour.\u201d \n \n We should do more to ensure a thorough investigation that not only respects those who were murdered in the attack on the plane, but also tries to find answers to who is responsible,\u201d Clinton wrote during the question-and-answer session on the social media site. \n \n 00.05 Good morning and welcome to today's live coverage of the MH17 crisis. \n \n More on the news that the MH17 black boxes have been handed over to Malaysian authorities. \n \n A senior separatist leader, Aleksander Borodai, was the man, as ever, in charge in Donetsk. \n \n \u201cHere they are, the black boxes,\u201d Borodai told a room packed with journalists at the headquarters of his self-proclaimed Donetsk People\u2019s Republic as an armed rebel placed the boxes on a desk. \n \n Both sides then signed a document, which Borodai said was a protocol to finalise the procedure after lengthy talks with the Malaysians. \n \n \u201cI can see that the black boxes are intact, although a bit damaged. In good condition,\u201d Colonel Mohamed Sakri of Malaysian National Security Council said in extending his thanks to \u201cHis Excellency Mr. Borodai\u201d for passing on the recorders. \n \n Borodai also said a train carrying the remains of the victims of the Malaysia Airlines plane catastrophe has reached Donetsk. It is on its way to Kharkiv, some 300km (186 miles) north-west. The Malaysian experts and a Dutch delegation also on site in Donetsk will travel along with it, he said. ||||| Video \n \n Image World loses HIV expert in MH17 disaster 1:18 Play video Professor Francoise Barr-Sinousi addresses the National Press Club with words of grief and loss over colleague and HIV expert Joep Lange, amongst hundreds dead in the crash of flight MH17. \n \n MORE than 100 AIDS activists, researchers and health workers bound for a major conference in Melbourne were on the Malaysia Airlines flight downed in the Ukraine. \n \n It is believed that delegates to the 20th International AIDS Conference, due to begin on Sunday, will be informed today that 108 of their colleagues and family members died on MH17. \n \n Stunned researchers, activists and development workers arriving at Melbourne Airport paid tribute to AIDS researcher Joep Lange and the other attendees believed killed aboard MH17. \n \n Jonathan Quick, head of a not-for\u2013profit medicine supply company working with the Global Fund and the US government in Africa and Latin America, described Professor Lange as a force for change in HIV/AIDS treatment. \n \n \u201cI remember meeting him back in the late 1990s.

The other tunnel was discovered Thursday. It\u2019s described as stretching more than 700 yards and more sophisticated, with an electric rail system and ventilation equipment. (Photo: Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) via AP) \n \n Two more suspected drug-smuggling tunnels linking warehouses in Tijuana and San Diego have been uncovered by U.S. and Mexican authorities, and a 73-year-old California woman is accused of being the logistics manager for one passageway. \n \n No drugs or other contraband were found in the so-called super tunnels, which featured lights, rails, wooden supports and ventilation, or in warehouses on either side of the border, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced Friday. \n \n The passages, which U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy said cost millions of dollars to build, were the sixth and seventh super tunnels found between Tijuana and San Diego since 2010. \n \n STORY: Major drug-smuggling tunnel found between San Diego, Tijuana \n \n The first tunnel found this week was found Tuesday in an industrial park in the Otay Mesa section of San Diego. About 600 yards long and 70 feet underground, it was detected under the cement floor of a warehouse containing children's toys and TVs. \n \n Wednesday, the San Diego Tunnel Task Force arrested Glennys Rodriguez, a U.S. citizen from Chula Vista, a San Diego suburb. She is accused of overseeing logistics and faces federal charges of conspiring with others to maintain a drug-involved premises. \n \n The second, more sophisticated passage was unearthed Thursday in Otay Mesa by Mexican investigators following leads from their U.S. counterparts.

(Immigration and Customs Enforcement / ) \n \n Just as Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in San Diego shut the door on their latest drug-smuggling tunnel case, another one opened up. \n \n On Wednesday, ICE officials arrested a 73-year-old Chula Vista woman on suspicion of overseeing the operation of an underground tunnel leading under the border to an Otay Mesa industrial park in San Diego. \n \n On Thursday, they found a second tunnel, which is one longer and more sophisticated than the first. \n \n The busts \u201celiminated a multi-million dollar drug smuggling venture and have reduced it to nothing more than a colossal waste of money on the part of the drug cartels,\" said William Sherman, the Drug Enforcement Administration's San Diego special agent in charge, in a statement. \n \n \"Our goal is to not only shut these tunnels down before they become operational, but to ensure that the cartels backing these elaborate smuggling operations are investigated and prosecuted.\" \n \n The two tunnel discovered this week mark the sixth and seven cross-border passages that authorities have located in the last four years. Officials have found more than 80 tunnels from California to Arizona since 2006. \n \n But the quantity of drugs \u2013 if any \u2013 that were successfully channeled through the tunnels found this week is unknown, authorities said. According to the federal complaint against Glennys Rodriguez of Chula Vista \u2013 who is accused of supervising the pathways - the warehouse where the first tunnel was found was purchased last May. \n \n In their announcement, authorities described the elaborate passage smugglers had carved under the border: \n \n The first tunnel was approximately 600 yards long, secured with wooden trusses and equipped with lighting and a crude rail system. Its exit on the U.S. side was 70-feet below ground and had a pulley system for hoisting packages to the surface. \n \n Children\u2019s toys were found strewn in the warehouse where the tunnel lead, officials said. \n \n Agents have found similar settings outside other tunnels they\u2019ve uncovered. They say operators hire people to occasionally drop by the property to make it appear to be a normal business to neighbors, according to court documents. \n \n The second tunnel was discovered by Mexican authorities on Thursday. Authorities found that the second tunnel exited just around the corner from the first and was noticeably more advanced. \n \n The second tunnel was about 700 yards long, had ventilation and a multi-tiered electrical rail system. \n \n So far, Rodriguez is the only person facing charges, but her criminal complaint names several other people who authorities believe are related to the tunnels, including a man who authorities said has been caught constructing cross-border tunnels before. \n \n ALSO: \n \n Chinese Americans say Irvine leaders have 'Cold War mentality' \n \n Teen stowaway survives, but how?

    "document": "Image copyright Win McNamee/Getty Images Image caption Ms Trump reportedly stopped using her personal email for official work after being told the rules \n \n Ivanka Trump used a personal email account to send hundreds of messages discussing official White House business last year, officials confirm. \n \n A review into her emails revealed she had used her private address to contact government officials. \n \n Ms Trump sent the emails before she was briefed on the rules, her lawyer says. \n \n In 2016, her father Donald Trump accused Hillary Clinton of putting the US \"in danger\" over her use of a private email while secretary of state. \n \n On Monday, the Washington Post reported that while Ms Trump's emails contained mostly logistical and personal information, some may still have been in violation of federal records rules. \n \n How serious is this? \n \n A Trump administration official told CBS News that Ms Trump's emails did not contain classified information, and what had occurred was basically a lack of understanding of the rules. \n \n Ms Trump stopped using her personal address for government correspondence after she was informed that she should not be doing so, the official said. \n \n However, Austin Evers, from a group called American Oversight, which submitted the freedom of information request that led to the discovery of Ms Trump's use of personal email last year, said the \"president's family is not above the law\". \n \n \"There are serious questions that Congress should immediately investigate,\" Mr Evers said in a statement. \n \n \"Did Ivanka Trump turn over all of her emails for preservation as required by law? Was she sending classified information over a private system?\" he added. \n \n Peter Mirijanian, a spokesman for Ms Trump's counsel Abbe Lowell, said in a statement to US media: \"Ms Trump sometimes used her private account, almost always for logistics and scheduling concerning her family.\" \n \n He added that Ms Trump did not create a private server and never transmitted any classified information. \n \n \"The account was never transferred or housed at Trump Organization, no emails were ever deleted, and the emails have been retained in the official account in conformity with records preservation laws and rules.\" \n \n What did Trump say about Clinton's emails? \n \n During his presidential campaign in 2016, Donald Trump said that Mrs Clinton's use of a private server to send official emails while in her post as secretary of state in 2009 was a scandal \"bigger than Watergate\". \n \n He repeatedly criticised her conduct, calling her actions \"illegal\" and a threat to the security of the US. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption President Trump insists Ivanka's emails are 'not like Hillary's' \n \n At the time of his campaign, Mr Trump frequently encouraged crowds at rallies to chant \"lock her up\" and threatened to imprison Mrs Clinton over the saga. \n \n He also called on Russia to help locate some 30,000 emails that Mrs Clinton had not turned over to investigators after she, or her lawyers, determined it was unnecessary as they were personal messages. \n \n What was the Clinton email saga all about? \n \n Before becoming secretary of state, Mrs Clinton set up an email server at her home in Chappaqua, New York, that she used for all work and personal emails during her four years in office. \n \n She did not use, or even activate, a state.gov email account, which would have been hosted on servers owned and managed by the US government. \n \n She said it was for convenience. \n \n An FBI investigation concluded that Mrs Clinton should not face charges, but said she and her aides had been \"extremely careless\" in their handling of classified information. \n \n Are private emails illegal? \n \n It is not illegal for White House officials to use personal email accounts for government business. \n \n However, under the Presidential Records Act and Federal Records Act, government officials must forward any official correspondence to a work account within 20 days for preservation. \n \n If this is not done reliably, the use of private accounts can put official records beyond the reach of journalists, lawmakers and others who seek publicly available information. \n \n There are also rules against sharing classified or privileged information on personal email accounts. ||||| Ivanka Trump sent hundreds of emails last year to White House aides, Cabinet officials and her assistants using a personal account, many of them in violation of federal records rules, according to people familiar with a White House examination of her correspondence. \n \n White House ethics officials learned of Trump\u2019s repeated use of personal email when reviewing emails gathered last fall by five Cabinet agencies to respond to a public records lawsuit. That review revealed that throughout much of 2017, she often discussed or relayed official White House business using a private email account with a domain that she shares with her husband, Jared Kushner. \n \n The discovery alarmed some advisers to President Trump, who feared that his daughter\u2019s prac\u00adtices bore similarities to the personal email use of Hillary Clinton, an issue he made a focus of his 2016 campaign. He attacked his Democratic challenger as untrustworthy and dubbed her \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d for using a personal email account as secretary of state. \n \n Some aides were startled by the volume of Ivanka Trump\u2019s personal emails \u2014 and taken aback by her response when questioned about the practice. She said she was not familiar with some details of the rules, according to people with knowledge of her reaction. \n \n The White House referred requests for comment to Ivanka Trump\u2019s attorney and ethics counsel, Abbe Lowell. \n \n In a statement, Peter Mirijanian, a spokesman for Lowell, acknowledged that the president\u2019s daughter occasionally used her private email before she was briefed on the rules, but he said none of her messages contained classified information. \n \n \u201cWhile transitioning into government, after she was given an official account but until the White House provided her the same guidance they had given others who started before she did, Ms. Trump sometimes used her personal account, almost always for logistics and scheduling concerning her family,\u201d he said in a statement. \n \n Mirijanian said Ivanka Trump turned over all her government-related emails months ago so they could be stored permanently with other White House records. \n \n And he stressed that her email use was different from that of Clinton, who had a private email server in the basement of her Chappaqua, N.Y., home. At one point, an archive of thousands of Clinton\u2019s emails was deleted by a computer specialist amid a congressional investigation. \n \n \u201cMs. Trump did not create a private server in her house or office, no classified information was ever included, the account was never transferred at Trump Organization, and no emails were ever deleted,\u201d Mirijanian said. \n \n Like Trump, Clinton also said she was unaware of or misunderstood the rules. However, Clinton relied solely on a private email system as secretary of state, bypassing government servers entirely. \n \n \n \n Ivanka Trump often discussed or relayed official White House business last year using a private email account with a domain that she shares with her husband, Jared Kushner. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images) \n \n Both Trump and Clinton relied on their personal attorneys to review their private emails and determine which messages should be retained as government records. \n \n Clinton originally said none of the messages she sent or received were \u201cmarked classified.\u201d The FBI later determined that 110 emails contained classified information at the time they were sent or received. \n \n [Inspector general blasts Comey and says others at FBI showed \u2018willingness to take official action\u2019 to hurt Trump] \n \n Austin Evers, executive director of the liberal watchdog group American Oversight, whose record requests sparked the White House discovery, said it strained credulity that Trump\u2019s daughter did not know that government officials should not use private emails for official business. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s the obvious hypocrisy that her father ran on the misuse of personal email as a central tenet of his campaign,\u201d Evers said. \u201cThere is no reasonable suggestion that she didn\u2019t know better. Clearly everyone joining the Trump administration should have been on high alert about personal email use.\u201d \n \n Ivanka Trump and her husband set up personal emails with the domain \u201cijkfamily.com\u201d through a Microsoft system in December 2016, as they were preparing to move to Washington so Kushner could join the White House, according to people familiar with the arrangement. \n \n The couple\u2019s emails are prescreened by the Trump Organization for security problems such as viruses but are stored by Microsoft, the people said. \n \n Trump used her personal account to discuss government policies and official business fewer than 100 times \u2014 often replying to other administration officials who contacted her through her private email, according to people familiar with the review. \n \n Another category of less-substantive emails may have also violated the records law: hundreds of messages related to her official work schedule and travel details that she sent herself and personal assistants who cared for her children and house, they said. \n \n People close to Ivanka Trump said she never intended to use her private email to shroud her government work. After she told White House lawyers she was unaware that she was breaking any email rules, they discovered that she had not been receiving White House updates and reminders to all staffers about prohibited use of private email, according to people familiar with the situation. \n \n Using personal emails for government business could violate the Presidential Records Act, which requires that all official White House communications and records be preserved as a permanent archive of each administration. It can also increase the risk that sensitive government information could be mishandled or hacked, revealing government secrets and risking harm to diplomatic relations and secret operations. \n \n Revelations about Clinton\u2019s personal email system led to an FBI investigation of whether she had mishandled classified information. The scandal shadowed Clinton throughout the 2016 White House race, culminating in then-FBI Director James B. Comey\u2019s controversial decision to hold a news conference a few months before the election to announce his conclusion that she had been reckless with government secrets but that there was not sufficient evidence she had intended to skirt the law. \n \n During the campaign, Donald Trump said the Democratic nominee\u2019s \u201ccorruption is on a scale we have never seen before\u201d and called her personal email use \u201cbigger than Watergate.\u201d \n \n Trump supporters still chant \u201cLock her up!\u201d at his rallies, and the president, nearly two years into his administration, continues to tweet about Clinton\u2019s emails. \n \n \u201cBig story out that the FBI ignored tens of thousands of Crooked Hillary Emails, many of which are REALLY BAD,\u201d he tweeted in August, referring to a Fox News story about claims that the bureau did not scrutinize all her emails. \u201cAlso gave false election info. I feel sure that we will soon be getting to the bottom of all of this corruption. At some point I may have to get involved!\u201d \n \n Ivanka Trump first used her personal email to contact Cabinet officials in early 2017, before she joined the White House as an unpaid senior adviser, according to emails obtained by American Oversight and first reported by Newsweek. \n \n [Ivanka Trump shuts down her namesake clothing brand] \n \n In late February 2017, she used her personal email to contact Small Business Administration chief Linda McMahon and propose they meet to explore \u201copportunities to collaborate.\u201d The following month, she emailed Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, suggesting that their staffers meet to discuss ways to collaborate on \u201clocational/workforce development and k-12 STEM education.\u201d \n \n While her messages were largely about government work, Trump was not then subject to White House records rules. \n \n When she joined the White House on March 30, Trump pledged to comply \u201cwith all ethics rules,\u201d responding to complaints that her voluntary role gave her all of the access and perks of the White House \u2014 but none of the legal responsibilities or constraints. \n \n \u201cThroughout this process I have been working closely and in good faith with the White House counsel and my personal counsel to address the unprecedented nature of my role,\u201d she said in a statement at the time. \n \n But Trump continued to occasionally use her personal email in her official capacity, according to people familiar with the review. \n \n Her husband\u2019s use of personal email for government work drew intense scrutiny when it was first reported by Politico last fall. The revelation prompted demands from congressional investigators that Kushner preserve his records, which his attorney said he had. At the time, administration officials acknowledged to news organizations, including the New York Times and Politico, that Ivanka Trump had occasionally used a private account when she joined the White House. \n \n [Kushner used private email account for some White House business] \n \n But Trump had used her personal email for official business far more frequently than known, according to people familiar with the administration\u2019s review \u2014 a fact that remained a closely held secret inside the White House. \n \n \u201cShe was the worst offender in the White House,\u201d said a former senior U.S. government official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal dynamics. \n \n After discovering the extent of her email use in September 2017, White House lawyers relied on Lowell, Ivanka Trump\u2019s attorney, to help review her personal emails to determine which were personal and which were official business, according to the people. \n \n The White House Counsel\u2019s Office did not have access to her personal account and could not review it without invading her privacy and possibly violating privileged communications with her attorneys, people familiar with the review said. \n \n After his review, Lowell forwarded emails that he had determined were related to official business to Ivanka Trump\u2019s government account, a move he viewed as rectifying any violations of the records law, they said. \n \n Lowell\u2019s review found fewer than 1,000 personal emails in which Trump shared her official schedule and travel plans with herself and her personal assistants, according to two people familiar with the review. \n \n Separately, there were fewer than 100 emails in which Trump used her personal account to discuss official business with other administration officials. \n \n The scope of her personal email use had not emerged in response to American Oversight\u2019s records request, which sought Trump\u2019s correspondence with Cabinet agencies in early 2017. Most internal White House communications are not subject to the Freedom of Information Act. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m disappointed \u2014 although not entirely surprised \u2014 that this administration disregarded clear laws that they more than anyone should have been aware of,\u201d Evers said. \n \n In many cases, government officials contacted Ivanka Trump first at her personal email address. That was the case with a note she received in April 2017 from Treasury Department official Dan Kowalski, who was seeking to set up a meeting between the president and the secretary general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an international economic group of which the United States is a member. \n \n \u201cI apologize for reaching out to you on your personal email for this, but it is the only email I have for you,\u201d he wrote, according to an email obtained by American Oversight. \n \n \u201cFor future reference my WH email is [redacted],\u201d Ivanka Trump replied. \u201cThanks for reaching out and making this introduction.\u201d \n \n But other times, Trump used her private email to initiate official business. \n \n In April 2017, she used her personal email to write to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\u2019s chief of staff, Eli Miller, suggesting that he connect with her chief of staff, Julie Radford. The email chain, obtained by American Oversight, was copied to Radford\u2019s government account. \n \n \u201cIt would be great if you both could connect next week to discuss [redacted],\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe would love your feedback and input as we structure.\u201d",

Earlier this week, Mr. Rubio opened the door to another run, saying that the shooting massacre in Orlando on Sunday had led him to consider how he might best [\u2026] ||||| Friends for 20 years, Marco Rubio and Florida Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera were at the scene of the Orlando massacre on Sunday when they had an unusually frank conversation about their political futures. \n \n \u201cYou should reconsider running for your seat,\u201d Lopez-Cantera told Rubio as they sat in the senator\u2019s pickup truck about an hour before sunset, after witnessing the aftermath of the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Rubio was caught off guard. After all, Lopez-Cantera has been running for his Senate seat in a crowded GOP primary for more than a year \u2014 with Rubio\u2019s encouragement. \n \n Lopez-Cantera made clear he was still fully committed to running, even as he initiated a gut-check moment for both of them. Until then, Rubio had resisted the entreaties of Senate leaders and donors to rethink retiring from the Senate. Lopez-Cantera\u2019s conversation removed one of the biggest obstacles to Rubio running again: a longtime friendship that he wouldn\u2019t want to ruin due to political ambition. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t want you to feel like you have to say that because of outside pressure,\u201d Rubio responded. \n \n But Lopez-Cantera said he felt \u201ccompelled\u201d to continue talking it through. The two of them were shaken by what they saw in Orlando, the bloody sidewalks and the ashen faces of local, state and federal authorities. \n \n \u201cThis is bigger than me. And this isn\u2019t about me. And it\u2019s not about you. It\u2019s about our country and this election,\u201d Lopez-Cantera said to Rubio, recounting the conversation for Politico. \u201cIt\u2019s deeply consequential. \u2026 In the current field, I\u2019m the best candidate in the general election. But I\u2019m not looking at this through rose-colored glasses.\u201d \n \n Bottom line, Lopez-Cantera said in the interview: \u201cNothing has changed. I\u2019m still running. Marco isn\u2019t.\u201d \n \n The filing deadline for the race is June 24, when Rubio is scheduled to hold a fundraiser for Lopez-Cantera. If Rubio decides to run, Lopez-Cantera won\u2019t file. Right now, longtime friends of both men believe Rubio ultimately won\u2019t run: The lure of a much bigger paycheck and proximity to his family will outweigh another term in the Senate. \n \n But in the next breath, they say no one really knows what Rubio will do, except the senator himself \u2014 and even he might still be agonizing over the decision. \n \n \u201cI\u2019ll go home later this week, I\u2019ll have some time with my family,\u201d Rubio told reporters in the Capitol on Wednesday as he headed to a classified briefing on the Orlando attacks. \u201cIf there\u2019s been a change in our status, I\u2019ll be sure to let everyone know.\u201d \n \n Polling shows Rubio is the strongest Republican in a potential race against the Democrats\u2019 strongest candidate, Rep. Patrick Murphy, in a contest that could decide control of the Senate. \n \n The Republican Senate race is crowded. And the full-court press to recruit Rubio to run for reelection has frozen fundraising and dampened Republican enthusiasm for all five major GOP candidates for the seat. None is as well known as Rubio. \n \n Some Republican and conservative groups have suggested they won\u2019t spend big in Florida, while more donors will give to oppose Rubio in order to hand him his second defeat in a year and brand him a double loser after his crushing loss in the presidential primary. \n \n As part of the maneuvers to get Rubio to reverse course, Lopez-Cantera and allies of his and Rubio\u2019s say the amount of disinformation spread by party insiders has been somewhere between staggering and absurd. \n \n For weeks, Lopez-Cantera and Rubio had privately mocked the rumors of them striking a deal or hatching some elaborate plot. In one telling, Rubio would run for reelection, win and then resign before the 2020 presidential election cycle, at which point Lopez-Cantera would run for his seat. In another version, Lopez-Cantera agreed with moneyed interests to drop out of the Senate race, endorse Rubio and then run for chief financial officer in 2018. \n \n All of it is false, Lopez-Cantera said. \n \n \u201cThere is no deal. There is no plan,\u201d Lopez-Cantera said. \u201cNone of it is true. Anyone who says that is lying and doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d \n \n But those who haven\u2019t been privy to the two friends\u2019 talks have been deeply skeptical about what they\u2019re up to. And if Rubio ultimately runs and Lopez-Cantera doesn\u2019t, some of the rumors will appear true. \n \n \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me this hasn\u2019t been orchestrated,\u201d said one Republican who supports one of Lopez-Cantera\u2019s rivals in the Senate race said, echoing Democrats. \u201cMarco is running and you can talk about all the friendship stuff you want, but this shows Marco is all about Marco.\u201d \n \n The campaign of one of Lopez-Cantera\u2019s Republican opponents, developer Carlos Beruff, fell for one of the rumor-filled reports and issued a statement Wednesday about Rubio in which the candidate said voters are \u201csick of career politicians and power brokers in Washington who care about one thing: holding on to power. But the voters of Florida will not obey them. They don\u2019t get to pick our candidates.\u201d \n \n As for the other Republican candidates, U.S. Rep. David Jolly said he\u2019ll announce his plans Friday. He might run for reelection to his Tampa Bay-area 13th Congressional District seat. Defense contractor Todd Wilcox indicated he\u2019ll stay in the race with or without Rubio, and those close to U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis say he\u2019d give strong consideration to running for reelection in the 6th Congressional District if Rubio runs. \n \n Lopez-Cantera acknowledges that his decision to bring up the race \u2014 especially after witnessing the aftermath of the carnage at the Pulse nightclub \u2014 put unexpected extra pressure on Rubio. \n \n Rubio\u2019s plans since last spring were to win the White House or return home to West Miami, where he lives less than a half-hour away from Lopez-Cantera\u2019s Coral Gables home. Rubio has hired Washington dealmaker Robert Barnett to field job offers and get the biggest payday possible, without lobbying or working on Wall Street. He also planned to hit the paid-speaker circuit. \n \n After two years, if Hillary Clinton wins this election, Rubio is expected to begin mounting a challenge to her in 2020. \n \n \u201cMarco ran for president as a senator and we saw how that played out,\u201d said one backer. \u201cThis is his chance to be at home, spend time with Jeannette [Rubio\u2019s wife] and their kids and make some real money so he can put all four of them through private college in the Northeast if he wants to. People forget he\u2019s the son of blue-collar immigrants. Things like this are more important to him than politics.\u201d \n \n Lopez-Cantera, who is also married and has two children, emphasized the importance of family to Rubio. \n \n \u201cUntil I mentioned this, he was really committed to spending time with his kids, being able to be home for more than 10 days without having to go somewhere on the campaign trail or back to Washington. He looked forward to coaching his son\u2019s football team,\u201d Lopez-Cantera said. \n \n Miami-Dade County Commissioner Steve Bovo, whose wife works as a policy adviser for Rubio, said he wasn\u2019t surprised by Lopez-Cantera\u2019s discussion. Bovo served in the Florida House when Lopez-Cantera was majority leader just after Rubio left as Florida House speaker, a post he held in 2007-08. \n \n \u201cCarlos is not only thinking about their friendship but the country,\u201d Bovo said. \u201cWe all know each other, go to each others\u2019 kids\u2019 birthday parties. In the difficult business we\u2019re in, we separate the friendship and the politics. But we never do anything to endanger our friendship.\u201d \n \n One Rubio insider said he believes Rubio should run for reelection because, as a senator, he\u2019ll have more ability to affect policy he cares about, raise money and draw attention. \n \n \u201cFrom a political perspective, this is about having a platform,\u201d the Republican said. \u201cWhen CNN calls, does the booker want former Sen. Marco Rubio or do they want, say, current Sen. Tom Cotton?\u201d \n \n A member of the Committee on Foreign Relations and Select Committee on Intelligence, Rubio has made foreign policy a specialty. And, friends say, he\u2019ll miss getting classified briefings and being in a position to do something about it. \n \n About 12 hours after Rubio and Lopez-Cantera spoke on Sunday, the senator was interviewed by conservative radio show host Hugh Hewitt, who likes to talk about foreign policy and the threat of terrorism. Hewitt unexpectedly switched gears on Rubio by asking whether the terrorist attack changed \u201cin any way your resolve not to seek reelection.\u201d \n \n Briefly caught flat-footed, Rubio said \u201cI\u2019ve been deeply impacted by it. I think when it visits your home state, and it impacts a community you know well, it really gives you pause to think a little bit about, you know, your service to your country and where you can be most useful to your country.\u201d \n \n \u201cI have a friend of mine who is running for the U.S. Senate,\u201d Rubio said later. \u201cSo I want to be fair, Hugh. I haven\u2019t thought about it in that context. I really don\u2019t want to link the two things right now, because I don\u2019t want politics to intrude in all of this.\u201d \n \n By then, though, it was too late. \n \n \u201cI brought this up. It wasn\u2019t mutual,\u201d Lopez-Cantera said. \u201cHe is in a position where he will make a decision. We\u2019re friends. We support each other.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \n Seung Min Kim contributed to this report. \n \n",

I thought the whole ensemble was hilarious, but Melissa's uttlerly balls-to-the-wall weird and highly original character had me in helpless fits, tears streaming down my face. She stole the show, as far as I'm concerned. \n \n I haven't seen her new movie, Identity Thief, yet. I'll probably read a few reviews first. But one reviewer whose opinion I'm totally disregarding is Rex Reed's. In his New York Observer review, he attacked Melissa for her weight. He actually did that, like that is something a professional film reviewer just does. Wait until you read what he said. It's infuriating. \n \n Advertisement ||||| How many ways can a grown person waste valuable time and lose vital I.Q. points at the same time? If you\u2019re a movie critic, the possibilities are unlimited. And they all come together in a new chunk of junk called Identity Thief. \n \n IDENTITY THIEF \u2605 \n \n (1/4 stars) Written by: Craig Mazin \n \n Directed by: Seth Gordon \n \n Starring: Jason Bateman, Melissa McCarthy and John Cho \n \n Running time: 111 min. \n \n In the trashy, stupefying screenplay by Craig Mazin, Jason Bateman is a Denver accountant named Sandy Patterson\u2014another in a long line of victims of the increasingly dangerous world of cyber-crime\u2014whose credit card has been hacked and copied by a felonious thief in Miami (cacophonous, tractor-sized Melissa McCarthy). Now there are two Sandy Pattersons\u2014an innocent fraud victim on one side of the country facing bankruptcy and a screeching, humongous creep on a marathon shopping spree on the other side of the country who is running up thousands of dollars in charges and wrecking her victim\u2019s credit rating in the process. The police do nothing, the male Sandy loses his job and faces jail time, and the only solution is to devise a plan to apprehend the fake, female Sandy and drag her from Florida back to Colorado to turn herself in and clear his good name. In order to stretch a five-minute idea into 107 minutes of contrived drivel some people may mistake for plot, the plan backfires. She beats him up, steals his wallet, wrecks his rental car and leaves him stranded on the highway in a pair of pants stolen from a dead hobo. With no identification or money, he gets arrested for assaulting an officer, drug dealing and illegal gun possession. And still, against all odds, they hit the road to Colorado pursued by killers, bounty hunters and \u201cskip tracers,\u201d who track down crooks who owe money to gangsters, jump parole and get involved in other intrigues invented by hack Hollywood screenwriters. The snafus in the worst road movie since The Guilt Trip plunge Mr. Bateman and his female hippo into a motel with only a double bed, a grotesque sex scene with a pickled reprobate she picks up in a bar who demands a threesome, a violent bar fight that bloodies his nose, a kidnapping, a multi-car collision going the wrong way on the freeway \u2026 but why go on? They seem to be making it up as they go along, in a movie that threatens never to end. \n \n By the time they got lost in the woods and fall into a den of hissing snakes, Elvis has long since left the building. Melissa McCarthy (Bridesmaids) is a gimmick comedian who has devoted her short career to being obese and obnoxious with equal success. Poor Jason Bateman. How did an actor so charming, talented, attractive and versatile get stuck in so much dreck? Identity theft is a real plague that is happening so often that people tremble every time they approach an ATM. It\u2019s a deserving subject that should be explored in a more viable film, but Identity Thief is so bad it\u2019s hard to believe it wasn\u2019t directed by Judd Apatow or the Farrelly Brothers. ||||| 'Identity Thief' review: A case of fraud MOVIE REVIEW \n \n Photo: Bob Mahoney, Universal Pictures Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Image 1 of 1 Jason Bateman plays a sweet guy whose credit cards and identity are stolen by a manic con woman played by Melissa McCarthy. Jason Bateman plays a sweet guy whose credit cards and identity are stolen by a manic con woman played by Melissa McCarthy. Photo: Bob Mahoney, Universal Pictures 'Identity Thief' review: A case of fraud 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \n \n Identity Thief \n \n Comedy. Starring Melissa McCarthy and Jason Bateman. Directed by Seth Gordon. (R. 111 minutes.) \n \n Think of this as a movie review or as just a friendly warning from a like-minded individual: \"Identity Thief\" looked really good from a distance. In fact, it looked like it couldn't miss. Melissa McCarthy has emerged in the last two years as one of the funniest and most promising comic actresses around, and the idea of matching her exuberant relentlessness with Jason Bateman's long-suffering sardonicism (yes, that's really a word) seemed inspired. \n \n Indeed, it was inspired. It inspired financial backing, an advertising campaign, two estimable talents and all the moviegoers who are planning to see it this weekend. The only people it most certainly didn't inspire were Craig Mazin and Jerry Eeten, who wrote the screenplay. \"Identity Thief\" is not only not funny. It's negative funny. It's short on laughs, but it will disturb and annoy. \n \n What seemed like a good idea - a comedy based on the phenomenon of identity theft - turned out to be comic quicksand. McCarthy plays Diana, a Florida woman who has made a life of stealing people's identities, getting fake credit cards under the stolen name and running up enormous bills. Her latest victim is a nice guy named Sandy on the other side of the country, who gets an inkling something is wrong when his credit card is rejected at a gas station. His second clue comes when the cops arrest him for having been drunk and disorderly in Florida. He's in Denver. \n \n If you've followed along this far, you might already be able to diagnose the movie's fatal flaw: The concept of one person stealing another's identity might be amusing in the abstract, but the minute you start filling in the details, it becomes the stuff of drama, not comedy. This is especially the case in \"Identity Thief,\" in which Sandy (Bateman) is a sweet guy, a hardworking family man with a third child on the way, who has finally lucked into a high-paying job. But now he faces dismissal, the complete destruction of his life, because of an imbecile in Florida. \n \n \"Identity Thief\" is constructed, believe it or not, as a road movie, a buddy comedy, in which two seeming opposites find common ground. Sandy goes down to Florida to bring Diana back to Denver so she can explain the whole situation to his boss. That a borderline sociopath would do a favor for a complete stranger - one who clearly means her ill - is far-fetched even in the loose terms of zany comedy. Even if she wanted to leave town, there is no reason she wouldn't ditch him at some point along the way. \n \n Actually, \"Identity Thief\" seems to be an attempt to wed a hot topic to the structure of \"Midnight Run,\" the 1988 classic starring Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin. Call it a coincidence, but both films feature two antagonists on a cross-country trip. In both, they're chased by mobsters (played here by T.I. and Genesis Rodriguez) and by a bounty hunter (played here by Robert Patrick). In \"Midnight Run,\" the men become better people for knowing each other, whereas \"Identity Thief\" is so clumsily written that we're told that that happens, even though it doesn't. \"You taught me about getting what you want,\" Sandy tells his nemesis, \"and about confidence.\" \n \n There are holes in the story you could float a blimp through and loose ends everywhere, but none of that would matter if \"Identity Thief\" had a spark of joy, some honest life to it. There is none. It's just an irritant, and the worst kind to boot, one that resorts to fake sentiment in the end, like a scoundrel begging for a reprieve. Yes, two or three times McCarthy, through an unexpected reading of a weak line, can coax a laugh - she's that talented - and Bateman is true to his role, which is to be a dramatic character facing personal tragedy who just happens to be stuck in a supposed comedy. \n \n But that's the best that can be said for \"Identity Thief,\" and even that's not much. ||||| All that good will Melissa McCarthy had after \u201cBridesmaids\u201d? Completely undone by \u201cIdentity Thief,\u201d an obnoxious comedy made worse by obnoxious sentimentality. Unfunny, predictable, and vulgar, it\u2019s the generic equivalent of a Judd Apatow movie. As always, you get what you pay for. \n \n Unless, of course, fat ladies rubbing their crotches and braying like mules is your idea of comedy gold, in which case, here\u2019s your swill of the week. Jason Bateman, trying manfully to hold on to his dignity, plays Sandy Patterson, a Denver corporate drone with a pregnant wife (Amanda Peet) and two little girls (sisters Mary-Charles and Maggie Elizabeth Jones). Mr. Average, in other words. McCarthy is Diana, a cheerful sociopath who smooth-talks Sandy out of his credit information over the phone and goes on a Florida shopping spree that ends up with the cops at her victim\u2019s door. \n \n The few laughs come early, via Diana\u2019s infectious shopaholic glee; few people in the movies enjoy themselves as enjoyably as McCarthy. Then the script by Craig Mazin and Jerry Eeten tortures itself in an effort to get Sandy and Diana together and on a road trip back to Denver, where he can turn her over to the law and convince his boss (John Cho) of his innocence. No, it doesn\u2019t make sense. Nothing in this movie makes sense. Next to \u201cIdentity Thief,\u201d \u201cInception\u201d is a marvel of sober concision. \n \n Advertisement - Continue Reading Below \n \n On the couple\u2019s trail are a psychotic debt collector (Robert Patrick, looking like a methed-out Kris Kristofferson) and two sharply dressed members of a drug cartel (Genesis Rodriguez and rapper T.I.) who want Diana dead for reasons even the screenwriters can\u2019t figure out. Director Seth Gordon \u2014 who had a promising little career making documentaries like \u201cThe King of Kong\u201d before going Hollywood with dreck like \u201cHorrible Bosses\u201d \u2014 puts more energy into the car chases than anything that passes for recognizable human behavior. \n \n At 108 minutes, \u201cIdentity Thief\u201d goes on forever, and you start ticking off the comedy clich\u00e9s and story beats to keep tedium at bay: Scene where McCarthy sings badly to \u201970s oldies on the car radio, check. Scene where Bateman loses his pants, check. Scene where McCarthy sees a picture of Bateman\u2019s kids and goes all gooey, sigh. \n \n And obligatory fat-guy butt cheeks, obviously. In what you\u2019d think would be the low point of \u201cIdentity Thief,\u201d Diana invites a portly gent named Big Chuck (Eric Stonestreet) back to a motel room for a furniture-wrecking bout of kinky sex while Sandy cowers in the bathroom. If the filmmakers really wanted to push the envelope, they\u2019d throw Sandy and Diana into bed together, but that might scare the paying customers. The movie\u2019s general attitude toward large people is that they\u2019re just regular folks once you\u2019re done making fun of them. \n \n Actually, the rock-bottom nadir of \u201cIdentity Thief\u201d would have to be the scenes that try to gin up sympathy for Diana: a weepy monologue about her foster-home upbringing and a late-inning makeover that gives the character a \u201csensible\u201d hairdo and a tasteful black dress. It\u2019s like putting a circus clown in a chador \u2014 what\u2019s the point? As a comedy star, McCarthy lives by aggression and the belief that she\u2019s the hottest thing on the planet. Her obliviousness empowers her; that\u2019s the joke, and she\u2019s in on it. In \u201cIdentity Thief,\u201d the joke\u2019s on her, and everyone comes out a loser.",

The husband and wife who carried out the shootings... (Associated Press) \n \n The officer identified Syed Rizwan Farook, a co-worker of most of those shot, as a possible suspect because he had left a work meeting \"out of the blue\" 20 minutes before the shooting and matched the description of a gunman, according to audio of dispatch recordings. \n \n \"He seemed nervous,\" the unnamed officer reported in an edited selection of recordings posted by The Press-Enterprise newspaper of Riverside. \n \n Farook and his wife carried out the attack that killed 14 people and wounded 21 others Wednesday. The couple, who the FBI said had become radicalized, died about four hours later in a firefight with officers in this city an hour east of Los Angeles. \n \n The shooting occurred at the Inland Regional Center, a social services agency, where the county Department of Public Health was renting the auditorium for an annual meeting. \n \n Trudy Raymundo, director of the department, was preparing to make a presentation when she heard gunfire outside. A gunman in a black ski mask and dressed all in black then burst through the door and started shooting. \n \n Raymundo dropped to the floor and huddled under a table with other colleagues as bullets sprayed the room that had been decked out with a Christmas tree, ornaments and other seasonal decor. \n \n \"It's constant shots and constant firing, and all you can think of is, 'Why don't they stop?'\" Raymundo said Monday in her first public comments since the slaughter. \"It was just endless.\" \n \n County health employees had trained for an active-shooter scenario a year earlier in the same room. \n \n \"Everyone was trying to be quiet and not draw attention to themselves as they were trained to do, to try to find as much protection as you can,\" said Corwin Porter, assistant director of the department. \"Unfortunately the room just didn't provide a whole lot of protection.\" \n \n Family members of witnesses said the initial gunfire lasted about 30 seconds and then the shooters reloaded and fired again before fleeing without saying a word. \n \n Raymundo said she saw one man enter the room, but that two left. \n \n Dispatch recordings reveal the back-and-forth from officers in the field and calm-talking dispatchers, including some of the confusion and misinformation that was relayed as they tried to figure out how many suspects were involved and whether they were still at the Inland Regional Center. \n \n \"We do not know if we still have an active shooter,\" one of the first officers on the scene reported. \"We supposedly have two down inside. We'll be making entry.\" \n \n A dispatcher put out the call: \"San Bernardino Police Department has an active shooter. ... They're asking for all units that are available.\" \n \n Nearly six minutes into the recordings, an officer identifying himself as Ida 9 reported Farook's name. \n \n He said the suspect \"left out of the blue and, um, then 20 minutes later the shooting occurred.\" \n \n Witnesses reported seeing a pair of gunmen wearing ski-type masks and vests, an officer said. \n \n A dispatcher later advised all units that three suspects wearing black masks and, possibly, tactical vests, fled in a black SUV with assault rifles. \n \n At some point, a man's voice reported a dozen \"DOAs,\" using the jargon for dead on arrival, and said others had been moved to a treatment area. \n \n That is followed by chatter about a bomb that shooters left behind. \n \n A lieutenant then tells all sheriff's deputies and police officers to get out of the building. \n \n \"Bomb arson has seen the device,\" someone said. \"It is out of the norms.

They killed 14 people and wounded 21 more with firearms at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino. \n \n Counterterrorism officials also told NBC News that Farook and Malik were making preparations for some time to \u201ctake care of both grandma and the baby.\u201d The couple lived in a Redlands, California residence with their 6-month-old daughter and Farook\u2019s 62-year-old mother, Rafia Farook. They left their daughter with Rafia Farook on the morning of the attack. \n \n Investigators are examining a $28,500 deposit made to Farook\u2019s bank account in the weeks before the Dec. 2 rampage. \n \n A U.S. counterterrorism official said that he didn\u2019t have details on the transfer, but that it \u201cwould be consistent with them making preparations for grandma and the kid.\u201d \n \n \u201cThey had purposely thought through that problem,\u201d said the official. \u201cThere were other indications of preparations.\u201d \n \n Reuters reported that the loan to Farook was made by the online lender Prosper. In a statement, Prosper said that the company is \"prohibited by law from disclosing any non-public, personally identifiable information regarding any loan originated through our platform.\" \n \n \"All loans originated through the Prosper platform are subject to all identity verification and screening procedures required by law, including U.S. anti-terrorism and anti-money laundering laws,\" the spokesperson said. \"Like all Americans, Prosper is shocked and saddened by recent events in San Bernardino.\" \n \n And a senior law enforcement official told NBC News Tuesday that FBI investigators have been told that Farook discussed staging an attack in California as early as 2012. \n \n The official said investigators don\u2019t yet know what to make of the claim, although they say it may bolster their growing suspicion that Farook was radicalized long before he returned from Saudi Arabia last year with his wife. \n \n The latest revelations come after NBC News reported Monday that federal investigators are interviewing a neighbor of Farook and Malik who bought two of the four guns that were used in the massacre. ||||| The loan offers investigators a key new detail as they try to unravel how Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik plotted the deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11. The money could also explain how they managed to pay for target practice at local gun ranges, as well as the rental sport utility vehicle they used during the Dec. 2 attack, the officials said.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 San Bernardino shooter Syed Rizwan Farook may have been planning mass murder even before he married accomplice Tashfeen Malik, according to sources close to the investigation. Officials tell CNN that Farook plotted to carry out an attack with somebody else in California in 2012, though it's not clear how far the preparations went. The plan was called off after a round of terror-related arrests in the area \"spooked\" Farook and his accomplice, one source says. Law enforcement officials tell NBC News that Farook and Malik appeared to have planned the San Bernardino attack for at least a year, training at local gun ranges and making financial arrangements for their 6-month-old daughter and Farook's mother. The FBI is still investigating a loan of $28,500 deposited into Farook's account two weeks before the attack, a loan that an investigator tells NBC \"would be consistent with them making preparations for Grandma and the kid.\" In other developments: The Los Angeles Times reports that former Minneapolis resident Mohamed Abdullahi Hassan, an alleged ISIS recruiter who targeted Westerners on social media, has surrendered to authorities in Somalia. Investigators suspect he may have influenced Farook. The San Bernardino Department of Public Health, which employed Farook and most of the 14 people killed in the attack, trained employees last year for an active-shooter drill in the same room at the Inland Regional Center that Farook and Malik attacked, the AP reports. \"Everyone was trying to be quiet and not draw attention to themselves as they were trained to do, to try to find as much protection as you can,\" an assistant director of the department says. \"Unfortunately, the room just didn't provide a whole lot of protection.\" Law enforcement sources tell the Times that a device Farook and Malik left behind at the scene of the attack may have been designed to kill first responders. The sources say the crude device, which included three pipe bombs, was disabled by water from the building's sprinkler system. See a photo of the holiday party taken just before the shooting here.",

We used a lab experiment to investigate the influence of media (email and voicemail) and task type (romantic and utilitarian) on both the psychophysiological responses of senders and the content of the resulting messages. Message senders had more arousing physiological responses when sending emails than when leaving voicemails. An interaction exists between media and task such that the content of romantic email messages was more positive than romantic voicemails; while the opposite was true for utilitarian tasks. Thus the choice of media triggers different emotional responses in the sender and leads to different message content. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| To email or not to email? For those in love, it's better than leaving a voice message \n \n Sept. 1, 2015 \n \n FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE \n \n \n \n BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -- In her hit single, Carly Rae Jepsen may have sung, \"Here's my number, so call me maybe.\" But according to a new research study from Indiana University, she might be more successful in finding love if she asked him to send her an email. \n \n The research, which has been accepted for publication in the journal Computers in Human Behavior, suggests that, in this digital age, an email can be more effective in expressing romantic feelings than leaving a voicemail message. \n \n Previous research and conventional wisdom suggested the opposite, that a voicemail message is a more intimate way to connect with others, but that may not be true, particularly among millennials. \n \n \u201cThe bottom line is that email is much better when you want to convey some information that you want someone to think about,\u201d said one of the authors, Alan R. Dennis, the John T. Chambers Chair of Internet Systems in IU\u2019s Kelley School of Business. \n \n Dennis and co-author Taylor M. Wells, an assistant professor of management information systems at California State University-Sacramento, set out to learn more about how we respond emotionally to these newer forms of communication. \n \n Although voicemail, email and texting are part of everyday life, very little is known about how their characteristics influence and distort communication in work and personal settings. \n \n Using psychophysiological measures from 72 college-age people, Dennis and Wells found that people who sent romantic emails were more emotionally aroused and used stronger and more thoughtful language than those who left voicemails. \n \n \u201cWhen writing romantic emails, senders consciously or subconsciously added more positive content to their messages, perhaps to compensate for the medium\u2019s inability to convey vocal tone,\u201d Dennis and Wells wrote in the paper, \u201cTo Email or Not to Email: The Impact of Media on Psychophysiological Responses and Emotional Content in Utilitarian and Romantic Communication.\u201d \n \n \u201cEmail enables senders to modify the content as messages are composed to ensure they are crafted to the needs of the situation. Voicemail lacks this feature,\u201d they added. \u201cA sender records a voicemail in a single take, and it can be sent or discarded and re-recorded, but not edited. Thus senders engage with email messages longer and may think about the task more deeply than when leaving voicemails. This extra processing may increase arousal.\u201d \n \n Previous research suggests that email and text chat are considered poor for communicating emotion. This is believed to be the first research study on how we respond to email using physiological measures. \n \n Dennis and Wells\u2019 findings weren\u2019t just about pulling heartstrings -- the use of email induced more arousing psychophysiological responses than voicemail, regardless of whether the message was utilitarian or romantic. Gender was not found to be a factor and was omitted in the final analysis. \n \n In an interview, Dennis noted that their findings run counter to media naturalness theory, a commonly held evolutionary standard suggesting that the further we get away from face-to-face communications, the less natural and less effective it becomes. \n \n \u201cIn this case, we found people adapted,\u201d Dennis said. \u201cEmail\u2019s been in the popular consciousness since the 1990s, and if you look at the new generation of millenials, and that\u2019s who we studied, they\u2019ve grown up with email and text messaging. So it may not be as unnatural a medium as we at first thought. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of theory that says email and other text communications don\u2019t really work very well,\u201d Dennis added. \u201cWe should probably go back and reconsider a lot of the stereotypical assumptions that we hold about email and text messaging that may not hold true when we take a deeper look at how people react physiologically.\u201d \n \n The researchers did not see much use of emoticons and emojis in their emails. Rather, they found that when writing emails, subjects took more time to choose their words carefully to make sure the language conveyed the full meaning. \n \n The study also demonstrated that the medium used can shape the content of the message. Senders of utilitarian messages sent less positive emails than voicemails for the same communication task. However, when composing romantic messages, senders included the most positive and most arousing emotional content in emails and the least positive and least arousing emotional content in voicemails. \n \n \u201cWe expected that using email for romantic communication would be more frustrating than using voicemail, but our data do not show this,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cThere was neither greater emotional arousal nor greater negative emotional valence when using email for romantic tasks versus utilitarian tasks. \n \n \u201cThese results taken together suggest that \u2018the medium is the message\u2019 (as famously coined by philosopher Marshall McLuhan in 1964) in a more fundamental way than we have previously understood,\u201d they added. \u201cOur results show that the medium changes how message senders feel and what they say.\u201d \n \n Dennis warns managers against misinterpreting these findings to suggest that face-to-face meetings, personal phone calls and other direct forms of communications aren\u2019t as useful. \n \n \u201cIf something isn\u2019t really clear and you want to make sure that everyone has the same understanding of what something means, that\u2019s best done in phone calls, face-to-face meetings or video conferencing,\u201d Dennis said. \u201cYou have different cues, and it\u2019s also synchronous discussion, as opposed to email, where time goes by before the receiver gets to it.\u201d \n \n The research was conducted by placing skin sensors on the subjects\u2019 faces to measure muscle movement associated with positive and negative emotion, and on their feet to measure arousal. Subjects were randomly chosen to do voicemail or email first and produce a utilitarian or a romantic message first. \n \n Wells conducted the research with Dennis while he was a doctoral candidate at the Kelley School. \n \n Related Links",

So report researchers at Indiana University Bloomington in the journal Computers in Human Behavior after analyzing both the messages being sent and the physical state of those doing the sending. Contrary to previous research and conventional wisdom suggesting that a voicemail message is more intimate than email, this study finds that, at least among the 72 college-age millennials analyzed, the act of writing produced in the sender far more emotional arousal and greater use of emotional language. The effect endures, too, since people tend to respond to messages using the same medium, thus the recipient may in turn experience similarly heightened emotions when replying, reports Pacific Standard. \"When writing romantic emails, senders consciously or subconsciously added more positive content to their messages, perhaps to compensate for the medium's inability to convey vocal tone,\" Dennis and Wells wrote in the paper. \"Senders engage with email messages longer and may think about the task more deeply than when leaving voicemails.

Mikaela Shiffrin, Alpine Skiing Mikaela Shiffrin, 18, looks to be the heir apparent to Lindsey Vonn, who is will this Olympics with knee injuries. Last year, at her first world championships, she beat much more seasoned skiers to take the slalom gold. Doug Pensinger/Getty Images Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. \n \n No athlete is more closely associated with extreme sports than Shaun White, who has parlayed his snowboarding daring and artistry into two Olympic gold medals, 13 Winter X Games titles and a multimillion dollar franchise. \n \n So when White abruptly withdrew from the inaugural Olympic slopestyle competition at the Sochi Games on Wednesday \u2014 citing the risk of injury and his preference, on balance, to focus on winning a third gold in the halfpipe \u2014 it had seismic effects. \n \n White\u2019s decision to bow out of the slopestyle event on the eve of qualifying not only robbed Sochi of yet another big name in a much ballyhooed event. It also added to the mounting evidence that Olympic organizers, in their zeal to jazz up the Winter Games in order to connect with a younger audience, may be carrying the \u201cno-limits\u201d ethos of extreme sports one step too far. \n \n At issue is the safety of Sochi\u2019s slopestyle course, which earlier this week ended the pursuit of gold medal favorite Torstein Horgmo of Norway. The first snowboarder to land a triple cork (three off-axis flips and four full rotations), Horgmo crashed while attempting a difficult trick on the rails near the top of the course in Monday\u2019s opening training session and broke his collarbone. \n \n From figure skating teams to female ski jumpers - a dozen new events will debut at the Winter Olympics in Sochi. (Associated Press) \n \n On Tuesday, Finland\u2019s Merike Enne injured her left ankle in a crash, and White, 27, jammed his left wrist in an accident. \n \n A slopestyle course is akin to an ice-covered, downhill obstacle course littered with jumps, rails and boxes. Riders are free to negotiate them any way they choose, rewarded for the daring and creativity of the jumps, flips and spins they pull off on their descent. \n \n Last weekend\u2019s rain scuttled the customary pre-event tests of the Olympic slopestyle course at Rosa Khutor Extreme Park. So the first time riders tried it was Monday. The height of the jumps came as a jolt to many riders who boast of knowing no boundaries. \n \n \u201cYikes!\u201d U.S. hopeful Keri Herman said, asked her initial impression. \u201cBut that\u2019s the same as X Games every year. You show up; it\u2019s scary. You hit it a couple of times and you are like, \u2018All right, I can deal with this.\u2019 \u201d \n \n White called it \u201cintimidating.\u201d \n \n And Sebastien Toutant of Canada told the Olympic News Service, \u201cIt\u2019s like jumping out of a building.\u201d \n \n After several snowboarders appealed for changes Monday night, the course was modified, with the tops and bottoms of some of the jumps smoothed out. \n \n Switzerland\u2019s Jan Scherrer told reporters Tuesday the modifications had helped. \n \n \u201cIt makes it more safe, but you can still go as big as before,\u201d Scherrer said. \u201cThe rails are much better so that you can see more tricks, rather than just trying to survive.\u201d \n \n After market research in the mid-1990s showed that the Winter Games were losing younger audiences, the International Olympic Committee turned to extreme sports to stem the decline, adding two snowboarding events (halfpipe and giant slalom) for the 1998 Nagano Games. \n \n In Sochi, a record 10 snowboarding events will be contested. Combined with a record 10 freestyle events, that means extreme sports will account for 20 of Sochi\u2019s 98 events. \n \n As the first medal event contested, slopestyle snowboarding, in which riders flip down the course like high-flying pinballs in a pinball machine, is expected to set an eye-popping tone for the Games. \n \n \n \n Venue map of 2014 Olympic games in Sochi Russia \n \n Although both snowboarders and freestyle skiers wear helmets, the risk of injury remains high. \n \n White gave no indication of his plans to withdraw during a news conference Wednesday afternoon, fielding questions from reporters in Sochi about the challenge of juggling both the Olympic halfpipe and slopestyle competitions and saying that his wrist injury had been \u201cblown out of proportion.\u201d But within an hour, he told NBC he was pulling out, saying that \u201cthe potential risk of injury is a bit too much for me to gamble my other Olympic goals on.\u201d \n \n Moments later, he issued the following statement through the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association: \u201cAfter much deliberation with my team, I have made the decision to focus solely on trying to bring home the third straight gold medal in halfpipe for Team USA. The difficult decision to forego slopestyle is not one I take lightly as I know how much effort everyone has put into holding the slopestyle event for the first time in Olympic history, a history I had planned on being part of.\u201d \n \n Roberto Moresi, assistant snowboard race director for the International Ski Federation, defended the course, telling the Olympic News Service: \u201cIt\u2019s only him that\u2019s pulled out, but people had already started to get into the course and like it a lot.\u201d \n \n Freestyle skiing\u2019s slopestylers will compete on the same course in Sochi. \n \n Charlottesville\u2019s Sara Greenfield, a former freestyle instructor and competitor who started the National Ski and Board Safety Association after her son\u2019s best friend was killed at a local resort, applauded White\u2019s decision to withdraw. \n \n \u201cInjury prevention is easier to provide when athletes stand up for their beliefs,\u201d Greenfield wrote in an e-mail exchange. \u201cI have seen many a jump redesigned to make it safer. Death and serious injury is simply put unacceptable, and it is occurring at alarming rates in these two sports. If there is a call for rail or jump safety, the builders of these obstacles should make them safer, or shut them down, take them out.\u201d ||||| Ashley Wagner, of the United States, skates at the figure stating practice rink ahead of the 2014 Winter Olympics, Wednesday, Feb. 5, 2014, in Sochi, Russia.

Based on information we received from our intelligence services, there's no reason to believe Sochi is under more threat than any city on the planet.\" \n \n Kozak's comments came during a previously scheduled news conference several hours after reports that the Department of Homeland Security had issued a bulletin warning airlines that explosives might be concealed in tubes of toothpaste \u2013 perhaps to be smuggled into Sochi \u2013 on flights from the U.S. to Russia. \n \n BRENNAN: Housing drama detracts from Sochi issues \n \n OLYMPICS: What's new in 2014? \n \n Kozak would not comment specifically on the report but said there was no reason to believe there were new threats. \n \n After the press conference, Scott Blackmun, CEO of the U.S. Olympic Committee, was asked how information about the threat was relayed to him: \"I don't want talk about specific responses to specific threats because I think it actually impairs our security plan to do that. But I will say that we were made aware of it, and I can't really say anything beyond that.\" \n \n \"The safety and security of our athletes and whole delegation is always the primary concern. As we always do we work closely with our state department and our state department is in very close contact with the local authorities. We react to situations as they arise but we also have a lot of planning exercises in advance and these games are no different than any other Games in that respect.\" \n \n That advisory is the latest in a series of security concerns leading up to Friday's opening ceremonies. Islamic extremist groups based in the nearby Caucasus mountains have vowed to disrupt the Olympics and claimed responsibility for twin December suicide bombing in Volvograd \u2013 roughly 500 miles away \u2013 that left more than 30 dead. \n \n Though Russia has promised a \"ring of steel\" around the Olympic area, with more than 40,000 security forces in the region, some members of the intelligence community have questioned whether the concentration of manpower will leave other outlying areas vulnerable to an attack. \n \n Kozak said the intensity of talk about the terrorism threat has been \"a little too much.\" \n \n \"In any place, in any sporting event on the planet, it has the same nature,\" he said. \n \n Kozak was also asked for his reaction to U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, who blasted any \"arrests, imprisonments and discriminatory restrictions\" carried out against homosexuals during a speech to the IOC on Thursday morning. The comments were pointed toward Russia's so-called \"gay propaganda\" law, which has inspired various forms of protest and political blowback leading up to the Games. \n \n Kozak essentially repeated Russian president Vladimir Putin, who said the law only bans propaganda aimed at minors and that gay athletes and visitors won't be arrested in Sochi. \n \n \"We don't differentiate between people depending on nationality, religion or sexual relations,\" Kozak said. \"We are all grown-ups and any adult has the right to understand their sexual acts.

    "document": "The otherwise benign-looking DVD hid a brutal double beheading that was stamped with all the hallmarks of Mexico's ultra-violent drug cartels. \n \n As the bloody short film booted up in the laptop, a sinister figure in a black balaclava appeared wielding the kind of sub-machine gun favoured by drive-by shooters in the US. \n \n The hooded man on screen then issued a thinly veiled threat to the audience of two watching the DVD - an American professional gambler, RJ Cipriani, and his Brazilian model and actress wife, Greice Santo. \n \n Pay up a $2.5m debt to a US cocaine kingpin with links to Mexican and South American drug cartels or a grisly fate awaits, warned the man in the DVD. \n \n A man holds gun and threatens RJ Cipriani and his wife Greice Santo (pictured right) in the DVD that was sent to them by Owen Hanson. (Supplied) () \n \n The film then cut away to a pair of shirtless men. Each is savagely beheaded \u2013 one with a chainsaw, the other a butcher's knife. \n \n In a San Diego courtroom last Friday, Owen \"O-Dog\" Hanson, the 35-year-old Californian who had sent that vicious DVD to Cipriani and his wife, was sentenced to 21 years and three months. He plead guilty to racketeering conspiracy and conspiracy to distribute drugs - US federal prosecutors also seized upwards of $6.5m of Hanson's cash and property assets. \n \n The $2.5m Hanson had been trying to shake out of Cipriani in the beheading DVD had an Australian connection, with the seven-figure sum having been lost in 2011 on VIP blackjack tables inside Sydney's The Star casino. \n \n High-roller Cipriani had blown the millions in drug money \u2013 purposefully he claimed - after realising he had been set up to launder Hanson's cocaine profits from his lucrative Australian operation. \n \n By the time of his arrest in September, 2015, Hanson had smuggled hundreds of kilograms of cocaine into Australia through connections in Mexico and Peru. \n \n Hanson, a former University of Southern California football player, was able sell a kilogram of cocaine for $230,000 in Australia, compared to $20,000 in Los Angeles. \n \n RJ Cipriani, who also goes by the name Robin Hood 702, pictured with actress and model wife, Greice Santo. (Supplied) () \n \n The cash flooded in, but Hanson needed to clean it. Enter Cipriani, a pro-gambler well known in Las Vegas betting circles. Around the time Hanson was lining his pockets with Australian drug money, Cipriani was branding himself as Robin Hood 702, a kind of philanthropist who would win money from the casinos to give to the poor. \n \n Cipriani had once dated a woman named Crista Velarde, who unbeknownst to him was now married to Hanson. One day she phoned Cipriani out of the blue, and told him she knew of an American businessman who wanted to bank roll Robin Hood 702's charitable efforts. \n \n Owen Hanson (left) came from a well-to-do affluent family yet still turned to crime, making millions in an international drug smuggling operation and illegal gambling racket. (Supplied) () \n \n After meeting up, Hanson explained to Cipriani that he loved the Robin Hood 702 vision. Hanson said he would give the high-roller his cash and whatever profits Cipriani made he could give away to the needy. The principle sum would go back to Hanson via a casino cashier's cheque. \n \n The plan sounded solid, straight out of a Martin Scorcese gangster flick, but down in Australia Cipriani got spooked. Hanson delivered several large suitcases and a carry bag containing millions of dollars in Australian fifty dollar bills to Cipriani's plush penthouse suite at the five-star Four Seasons Hotel in Sydney. \n \n \"I can't begin to tell you how many people have offered me money; put up money for me to gamble,\" Cipriani told nine.com.au, recalling the cash exchange with Hanson. \n \n \"It wasn't unusual in the slightest for someone to say, 'Here's some money go gamble'.\" \n \n Crista Velarde, wife of Owen Hanson, appeared in court to watch her husband get sentenced. (Supplied) () \n \n But the way Hanson handed over millions of dollars like it was no big thing unsettled Cipriani. So, inside The Star casino's VIP room, Cipriani decided to \"leave it with the gambling gods\" and lay the maximum bet of $20,000 on every hand. In a couple of days, every dollar of the $2.5m was gone. \n \n Hanson was furious. He met Cipriani at a bar inside The Star, and he brought with him some extra muscle, a former Australian MMA fighter. \n \n Cipriani told nine.com.au how Hanson's snarling henchman said he was going to cut the gambler's throat, and that he was to hand over his passport. \n \n Cipriani went back to his hotel room and called security at The Hilton Hotel, where the hired muscle was staying. \n \n He falsely told Hilton staff that a man with a gun was inside room 3026. Staff called NSW police, who stormed the room but they didn\u2019t find a gun. Police officers did, however, find a suitcase stuffed full of $702,000. \n \n 'I was so emotional I was trying to hold back tears. I was talking about my wife and what they did to her. It all came back to me, all the emotions all the anger. It finally gave me and my wife closure because there was a fear that Owen Hanson was only going to get five years or ten years.' Rj Cipriani told nine.com.au the emotion of delivering a victim impact statement. () \n \n That now infamous cash-packed suitcase marked the start of a joint four-year investigation between the NSW Police and FBI that ended with the take down of Hanson and the dismantling of his drug and gambling operation, O-Dog Enterprise. \n \n But in the four years leading up to his arrest in the car park of a San Diego golf club, Hanson had tried various methods to try and intimidate Cipriani to hand over the missing $2.5m cash. \n \n After Hanson had desecrated his mother's grave, Cipriani went to the FBI and became a source, codenamed Jackpot. \n \n During Hanson's sentencing last week, Cipriani delivered an emotional victim impact statement, often fighting back tears. \n \n He detailed the threats made against his actress wife, Greice Santo, and the long-lasting impact they had left. \n \n \"Words cannot describe the horror my wife went through watching every frame of the beheading video. It was gruesome,\" Cipriani said. \n \n \"She is so paranoid still today because of what Owen Hanson put her through. She constantly looks over her shoulder \u2026 and she can't check her mail without being worried that another package might be sent by Owen Hanson or one of his crew.\" \n \n Crista Velarde, Hanson's dark-haired wife, appeared in court to watch the judge hand down a punishing sentencing of 255 months on her gangster husband. \n \n Greice Santo was terrorised by Owen Hanson's henchman for years. The actress was sent packages and received continous abusive and threatening phone calls. (Supplied) () \n \n Cipriani told nine.com.au he blamed Velarde for what had happened to him and his wife. \n \n \"I trusted her, I dated her years ago. I never thought in a million years that Crista Velarde would set me up with her husband who happened to be a very, very big international drug dealer,\" he said. \n \n Cipriani targeted Hanson and Velarde with a personal barb at the end of his victim statement: \"While you sit and rot in jail for decades your wife Crista Velarde has moved on with her life, and has been spending your money and having a grand old time.\" \n \n When Cipriani first approached the FBI in Philadelphia, they did not believe his story. Undeterred he took it to the San Diego field office and they had launched an investigation. \n \n Cipriani praised assistant US attorney Andrew Young, FBI agent Brett Fenoglio and two other undercover agents, known only as John and Nick, for believing the information he had on Hanson, and who had orchestrated the downfall of the crime boss's smuggling operation. \n \n A photo of RJ Cipriani's mother's tombstone, that was vandalised by one of Owen Hanson's crew. This was another example of threats and packages sent to Cipriani and Santo. (Supplied) () \n \n \"Owen Hanson was at the top of his game. He wasn't a mid-level guy, he was at the top of the food chain for quite some time,\" Cipriani said. \n \n \"Countless lives have been saved because the drugs that Owen Hanson was selling were destroying and polluting lives globally.\" \n \n A total of 20 people in the US who were linked to Hanson's O-Dog operation have pleaded guilty to various charges. \n \n FOLLOW: Mark Saunokonoko on Twitter \n \n \u00a9 Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2018 ||||| OWEN HANSON SENTENCING IN SAN DIEGO FEDERAL COURTHOUSE DECEMBER 15TH AT 2PM \n \n ALREADY PLED GUILTY TO 20 YEARS MINIMUM MANDATORY pic.twitter.com/1xD2huyy1j \u2014 Robin Hood 702 (@robinhood702) December 14, 2017 \n \n The blackjack player was blowing through his money but it wasn\u2019t troubling him. He was anxious to empty his pockets. \n \n Robert J. Cipriani had thrown out his usual game plan as he worked the neon-splashed rooms of the Star Casino in Sydney in August 2011. In the parlance of high-stakes gambling, Cipriani \u2014 a Philadelphia-born card player who dubbed himself \u201cRobin Hood 702\u2033 because he funneled portions of his winnings to philanthropic causes \u2014 was known as a \u201cshortstop.\u201d \n \n It meant he cobbled winnings together with modest bets and refrained from make-it-or-break-it wagers. But in Australia he had decided to \u201cleave it with the gambling gods,\u201d as he would explain later, uncharacteristically dropping maximum bets of $20,000 on every hand he played at the casino\u2019s VIP tables. He had a reason to want to lose. He didn\u2019t want to be involved anymore. \n \n Within a few days, Cipriani\u2019s reckless run bottomed out: He purposely lost $2.5 million at the tables. \n \n There was one small problem: It was not his money, but the illegal proceeds of an international drug and gambling operation. \n \n The man who fronted the cash \u2014 Owen \u201cO-Dog\u201d Hanson \u2014 was banking on Cipriani to launder the millions through the casino. And now the kingpin was not happy. The card player\u2019s life was about get ugly. \n \n On Friday, Hanson was sentenced to 21 years in prison in a San Diego courtroom after pleading guilty to racketeering and drug distribution charges, the Los Angeles Daily News reported, ending the career of an unorthodox drug lord. \n \n Born and raised in Southern California, Hanson had been a walk-on tight end on the 2004 championship-winning University of Southern California football team, a squad coached by current Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll and featuring future NFL players Reggie Bush and Matt Leinart. Hanson\u2019s rise from frat-boy jock to Porsche-driving crime boss began to unravel the day in 2011 gambler Cipriani lost his money in Sydney. \n \n According to a Rolling Stone article from November 2016, Hanson started slinging drugs when he was at USC. \n \n \u201cIf you wanted something you went to O-Dog,\u201d a former friend told the magazine. \u201cCoke, steroids, you name it.\u201d \n \n After college, Hanson got heavily involved in sports betting, working as a bookie for clients in Los Angeles. \n \n \u201cHe ran his gambling business like drug dealers run the drug business,\u201d a former customer told Rolling Stone. \u201cIf you\u2019re short a little money they\u2019ll kill you \u2014 that\u2019s the attitude that he brought. It took all of us off guard. We are all educated . . . white dudes. We thought he was one of us, but he acted like an Italian gangster from Queens.\u201d \n \n Hanson eventually branched into drug dealing. The federal government would later accuse him of trafficking in cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, MDMA, as well as selling anabolic steroids to pro athletes. \n \n Court records indicate he collected around him a crew of enforcers with nicknames like \u201cTank\u201d and \u201cAnimal.\u201d Hanson named his crew after himself: \u201cO-Dog Enterprise.\u201d With his ill-gotten proceeds, Hanson built himself an opulent house in Redondo Beach, Calif., with a pool and the walls covered with a silver-plated AK-47 pressed with the Louis Vuitton logo, Rolling Stone reported. \n \n In June 2011, Hanson reached out to Cipriani, the card player, through a mutual acquaintance. When the two first met in Australia, Hanson presented himself as a legitimate wealthy investor interested in fronting cash for Cipriani\u2019s charity gambling. \n \n \u201cWe went upstairs and he had a suitcase already just sitting there,\u201d Cipriani told the magazine. \u201cHe goes, \u2018Here, I\u2019m gonna give you a million dollars.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Bro, you don\u2019t even know me and you\u2019re gonna give me a million dollars?\u2019 \n \n \u201cAnd he goes, \u2018Yeah, but I heard a lot about you, I have a feeling.\u2019 And I say, \u2018But you understand that there\u2019s a chance that I don\u2019t win?\u2019 He goes, \u2018Look, I\u2019ll tell you what, I believe in you so much \u2026\u2019 And he opens this cabinetry that literally was stacked with $50 bills in Australian dollars. No locks, no keys, nothing! He grabs some more and says, \u2018I\u2019m giving you a million and a half.\u2019 \u201d \n \n Hanson\u2019s idea was that the gambler could easily cash drug money into chips at a casino, play for a while, then cash out the winnings in return for a casino check. Hanson told Cipriani he could keep whatever he won for his charity; the rest would go back to Hanson. \n \n But after playing some with Hanson\u2019s money, Cipriani began to suspect he was being used to funnel dirty cash. When the two men met up in Sydney in August 2011, he told Hanson he was uncomfortable with the arrangement when Hanson tried to hand him $2.5 million in cash for the tables. \n \n \u201cYou have a beautiful wife,\u201d Hanson told the gambler, a subtle threat to Cipriani\u2019s wife back home. \u201cYou\u2019re going to do this, you understand?\u201d \n \n To get out of the situation, Cipriani proceeded to blow through Hanson\u2019s $2.5 million. When Hanson learned his money was gone, however, he began relentlessly threatening the gambler to pay him back. He said he would cut the gambler\u2019s throat in Sydney, bringing along an ex-MMA fighter to intimidate Cipriani, the card player told Australia\u2019s 9 News. \n \n Back in the States, the threats continued, according to court documents. In 2013, Hanson sent Cipriani and his wife a DVD. The disk included footage of two men being beheaded, one with a knife, the other with a chain saw. A note was included with the DVD: \u201cIf you don\u2019t pay us our money, this will happen to you,\u201d according to prosecutors. The couple also spotted a man lurking outside their Santa Monica home. \n \n Finally, Hanson paid an underling to find Cipriani\u2019s parents\u2019 graves in New Jersey, where the guy defaced the tombstones with red paint, Cipriani told 9 News. Hanson added an image of himself into the pictures of the tarnished graves, then sent them to the gambler. \n \n After receiving the photos of the defaced graves, Cipriani contacted the FBI, helping investigators with an ongoing case against O-Dog Enterprise. Hanson was arrested in 2015. Eventually 21 other members of the crew were arrested on federal charges related to gambling and drug trafficking. \n \n In January, Hanson pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy and conspiracy to distribute drugs. \n \n \u201cIt is difficult to understand how you got here,\u201d U.S. District Judge William Hayes told Hanson in court Friday. \u201cOther than greed.\u201d \n \n More from Morning Mix: \n \n Fox News contributor, channeling Alex Jones, suggests FBI plot to assassinate Trump \n \n In first TV interview, Harvey Weinstein\u2019s former assistant discusses his \u2018overarching need for power\u2019 \n \n ISIS sympathizer who plotted to behead blogger Pamela Geller gets 28 years in prison ||||| Inside the story of Owen Hanson, former USC athlete suspected of heading an international gambling and drug syndicate \n \n THE GAMBLER AND THE PLAYER \n \n \n \n Robert J. Cipriani arrived in Sydney feeling the way he always did on the eve of a gambling trip: giddy, confident, a hustler with pure intentions. It was August, 2011. Under the pseudonym of Robin Hood 702, Cipriani billed himself as an unorthodox philanthropist: the high stakes blackjack player who used his winnings to benefit those in need. It was an act inspired by his own hardscrabble past in blue-collar Philadelphia, and conceived during regular sojourns to Las Vegas (702 is the city's area code). Though Cipriani kept his identity secret, shielding his face in a baseball cap, aviator sunglasses and the occasional fake beard, he was not exactly inconspicuous in his guise as a workingman's hero. Those seeking his help submitted stories of financial woe to his website, and Cipriani would select a \"winner\" before hitting the tables, ideally with a camera crew in tow. Fox News had once christened him the \"Sin City Savior,\" and he envisioned himself the subject of similar publicity during his stay in Sydney, where as \"Robin Hood\" he planned to spend the next few days gambling on behalf of downtrodden locals at the Star Casino. \n \n Related Ex USC Athlete Owen Hanson Gets 21 Years in Prison for Drug Trafficking Hanson pleaded guilty to racketeering and conspiracy to distribute drugs back in January \n \n Within an hour of getting settled in his suite at the Four Seasons, however, there was an unexpected knock at the door. Cipriani was greeted by an American businessman he knew by the name of Junior DeLuca. In his late twenties, DeLuca was a figure of shrewd intelligence and imposing physicality, striding into the room with the coiled energy of someone who at any moment might drop to the floor and pound out 100 pushups without breaking a sweat. He had slicked back brown hair, a jawline that could double as a nutcracker, and sculpted shoulders tugging at the pressed seams of his dress shirt. Entering the suite, he was lugging two large suitcases behind him. \n \n \n \n From what Cipriani had gleaned, he and DeLuca had plenty in common. Both men lived in Los Angeles, spent significant time on the Strip in Vegas and shared an irrepressible need for attention, cultivating an air of nebulous, self-manufactured fame. The difference, as became apparent the moment DeLuca unzipped the suitcases, was that while Cipriani promoted himself as a kind of altruistic outlaw, DeLuca's business seemed to be of the more straightforward criminal variety. Inside were crisp bundles of cash totaling $2.5 million in Australian dollars \u2013 a staggering pile of money that would come to derail both men's lives in spectacular fashion. \n \n \"Listen,\" DeLuca said, \"I need you to do me a favor.\" \n \n Four years later, on September 9th, 2015, a former football player at the University of Southern California named Owen Hanson stepped onto the manicured fairway at the Park Hyatt Aviara Golf Club, in Carlsbad, California, a resort town on the Pacific coast 90 miles south of Los Angeles. Hanson had been a walk-on tight end on the storied Trojans squad that Pete Carroll, today the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, led to repeat national championships in 2004 and 2005. Though Hanson never played a down, his brief stint on the outer periphery of the spotlight left a lasting impression. Ten years removed from college, he referenced his USC days often, maintained a USC email address and led a life that, on the surface mirrored those of better-known former USC teammates, like Reggie Bush and Matt Leinart, who went on to sign multi-million-dollar contracts with the National Football League. \n \n Hanson, or \"O-Dog\" as he christened himself as a charismatic fraternity brother at USC, still certainly looked like a formidable athlete. Standing 6-foot-2 and weighing more than 200 pounds, he cut a steroidal silhouette on the golf course, emitting the icy confidence of a man who viewed life as a competition he was used to winning. He drove a white Porsche Panamera, owned property in Mexico and Costa Rica, and routinely partied with athletes like Jeremy Shockey, the rambunctious former tight end who won Super Bowls with the New York Giants and New Orleans Saints. In Hanson's hometown of Redondo Beach, a seaside community in L.A.'s South Bay, he had built himself a sleek residence that featured a lap pool, an ornate \"tequila room,\" and wall d\u00e9cor that included a silver-plated AK-47 embossed with the Louis Vuitton logo. \"I go to Vegas a few times each month, and I wanted my house to feel like some of my favorite hotels there,\" Hanson told an online magazine in 2014, in a profile that showcased the property as an extension of Hanson's success as a real estate developer. \n \n As Hanson prepared for his 18 holes that September afternoon, agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Organized Crime Squad arrested him for arranging the sale of five kilograms of cocaine and another five of methamphetamine \u2013charges that turned out to be only a preview of the extraordinary case authorities had built against him. In January, Hanson was named in a federal indictment as the unlikely leader of a drug trafficking, sports betting and money-laundering ring called O-Dog Enterprises that stretched from Southern California to Australia. According to authorities, Hanson appears to have used his connections within the world of professional sports \u2013 first established back at USC and later fostered in the VIP rooms of Los Angeles clubs and Las Vegas casinos \u2013 to bolster his organization. Aside from hanging out with famous athletes while operating Betodog.com, a website that processed illegal wagers on their games, he is accused of coordinating the sale of five grams of cocaine and 15 capsules of ecstasy to \"a professional football player\" in 2014, according to the indictment; and among the 21 others arrested in January as alleged co-conspirators in Hanson's scheme \u2013 a dizzying list of characters that includes an accused drug dealer nicknamed \"Tank,\" a bookie who went by \"Jazzy,\" an enforcer known as \"Animal,\" and a Hollywood private detective \u2013 is a former N.F.L. running back named Derek Loville. The winner of a Super Bowl with the San Francisco 49ers in 1994, and two more, in 1997 and 1998, with the Denver Broncos, he now stands accused of selling cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and ecstasy as an Arizona-based member of Hanson's alleged racket. \n \n George Rose/Getty \n \n If in his public life Hanson gave the impression of an ambitious young man who worshipped money and emulated pro athletes, his downfall as a kingpin, to judge from court records, stems from a need to develop a more sinister self-image, building his empire through ruthless intimidation, paid beat downs and baroque death threats. In his criminal shadow life, he even went so far as to adopt an alias befitting a mafia don. \n \n Junior DeLuca, he called himself. \n \n THE HUSTLE \n \n The story of how Robert Cipriani became entangled with Owen Hanson \u2013 the story, that is, of how a vigilante gambler unwittingly helped bring down a USC athlete turned accused crime boss \u2013 can be appreciated from any number of angles: as a clash of misguided egos, a glimpse into the turbulent psyches of former athletes or as a cautionary tale, quintessentially American, about what can happen to a certain breed of individual bent on chasing the sort of dreams that burn especially bright in places like Las Vegas and Los Angeles. It begins, however, in Sydney, where back in 2011 Hanson, inhabiting his alter ego as DeLuca, showed up at Cipriani's room at the Four Seasons with $2.5 million in Australian dollars (worth $2.7 million in U.S. dollars at the time) stuffed into suitcases. \n \n When Cipriani first shared with the FBI his version of the chain of events leading to that encounter, to say nothing of the macabre absurdity that followed, he says agents at the bureau's Philadelphia office were less than receptive. \"Literally,\" Cipriani explains, \"they just laughed.\" In fairness to the authorities, such a reaction to Cipriani is understandable. A tall and rangy guy who in middle age retains the blustery temperament of an adolescent, he dresses, by this own admission, \"like a bum,\" but portrays himself as floating through a glittering world of comped hotel suites and flights on private jets. He speaks in grandiloquent, expletive-laced monologues that, much like his Robin Hood shtick, tend to be both entertaining and inconceivable. Give him five minutes and he'll tell you about his friendship with the boxer Lennox Lewis; the legs of his wife, a Brazilian actress-model named Greice Santo; and his foolproof solution for preventing future terrorist attacks. The man has a certain off-color charm, but as someone who makes his living hustling, you can't shake the itch that in some hard-to-pin-down way he is trying to play you. \n \n Yet to spend time with Cipriani is to discover that the most preposterous thing about him may not be the hucksterish, self-mythologizing exterior, but the fact that so much of what he says checks out. When Lennox Lewis served as a pallbearer in Muhammad Ali's funeral earlier this year, the boxer sent Cipriani a photo of the ceremony via text \u2013 one that Cipriani happily passed on to the Daily Mail. When Vanity Fair published a two-part expos\u00e9 on Tiger Woods back in 2010, there was \"Robin Hood 702\" serving as a prominent source. And in the federal government's sweeping case against Owen Hanson, it is Cipriani, a confidential source nicknamed \"Jackpot\" by the FBI, who serves as the man who provided some of the most incendiary evidence about how Hanson pursued his extralegal affairs. \n \n The two had met in June of 2011, when Cipriani first traveled to Sydney to drum up media interest in his forthcoming escapades as Robin Hood. The way Cipriani remembers it, he had heard about Hanson from a woman he dated years ago in L.A. \"Mexican, smoking hot, used to being given $25,000 Herm\u00e8s bags,\" is Cipriani's description. She mentioned, vaguely but intriguingly, that she knew a wealthy young American who did business in Australia and was a \"fan\" of Cipriani's. Could she arrange a meeting? When Cipriani arrived in town, he found Hanson waiting for him at the lobby bar of the Four Seasons. \n \n \"Mind you, he's still Junior to me at that point,\" Cipriani recalls. \"We make some small talk and then he says, 'Look, I want to give you some money to gamble with.'\" He invited Cipriani to discuss the matter further at a nearby apartment. \"Wasn't the overly impressive place that you would think, because he was really well dressed,\" continues Cipriani. \"You know, with fucking cufflinks. Anyways, we went upstairs and he had a suitcase already just sitting there. He goes, 'Here, I'm gonna give you a million dollars.' And I said, 'Bro, you don't even know me and you're gonna give me a million dollars?' And he goes, 'Yeah, but I heard a lot about you, I have a feeling.' And I say, 'But you understand that there's a chance that I don't win?' He goes, 'Look, I'll tell you what, I believe in you so much...' And he opens this cabinetry that literally was stacked with $50 bills in Australian dollars. No locks, no keys, nothing! He grabs some more and says, 'I'm giving you a million and a half.'\" \n \n Gamble with the money, Hanson proposed. Keep what you win for the Robin Hood thing, and return the rest. \n \n According to court records, Hanson made the bulk of his drug money in Australia, importing over a ton of cocaine into the country and later boasting to an undercover F.B.I. agent that he sold kilos of coke there for $125,000, or more than triple the going rate in the U.S. In Cipriani, he apparently saw a means of solving the problem that has long confounded many successful criminal organizations: a surplus of dirty money, no easy way to clean it. By having Cipriani cash the drug profits into chips, gamble for a bit to avoid suspicion, and then take it back in the form of an easily-transportable casino check, Hanson was attempting to slyly turn the casino into a shell company for laundering money. Cipriani concedes that he was an ideal mark: \"If you don't have the reputation of being a high-roller and you try to walk into a casino with millions in cash, they're gonna go, 'Who the fuck is this guy?' But because I'm this famed international gambler, they don't think twice.\" \n \n Believing he had stumbled upon a patron of sorts \u2013 a personal \"whale,\" in casino terminology \u2013 Cipriani took the money and hit the tables at the Star Casino, a palace of curved glass framed by palm trees located a few blocks from the Four Seasons. \"I play what they call, in the casino industry, being a shortstop,\" he says. \"I hit and run \u2013 $20,000 spot here, $30,000 there. It's the only way you can beat the casinos.\" Within a few days he had made nearly $300,000, and, per his agreement with Hanson, got a casino check for over $1.7 million. \n \n The initial signs of trouble began when he phoned Hanson about delivering the funds. \"I'm traveling,\" Hanson said. \"Just hang onto the money, and give it to me back in L.A.\u201d \n \n What followed was a surreal few weeks leading up to Cipriani's second trip to Sydney that August. Back in the States, he did what any gambler with an insatiable appetite for risk would do: He flew to Vegas to see if he could keep his streak going. But after a few days only about $200,000 was left. Panic set in when Hanson called, saying he was back in town and would like his money. \n \n \"Dude, I told you you shouldn't have let me keep it,\" replied Cipriani, explaining what had happened. \n \n Hanson was all calm swagger, expressing certainty that Cipriani would turn his luck around. \"That belief in me,\" Cipriani says, \"it drew me in.\" He stayed in Vegas, working the casinos until he had a million dollars. Returning to L.A., he met Hanson for lunch at the Fairmount Miramar Hotel, in Santa Monica, where Cipriani handed Hanson a duffle bag filled with the money. Then it was back to Vegas, but when he called Hanson about an additional $250,000, he was again out of town. This time Hanson instructed Cipriani to give the money to the former fling who had first introduced the two. A week or so later, when Cipriani had another $150,000, Hanson told him to meet another associate, this time in the parking lot of the Fairmount Miramar. These clandestine handoffs of large sums of cash did not, Cipriani says, sit well. But before he could pay back the $100,000 he still owed, he was due to travel again to Sydney as Robin Hood. \n \n It was then, in August, that Hanson showed up at the Four Seasons with the $2.5 million stuffed into two suitcases. \n \n Forget the debt, Hanson said, proposing again that Cipriani gamble with the money and return the original in check form. In fact, he told Cipriani he could go ahead and lose up to $600,000 of the $2.5 million, an offer that would have been enticing if it didn't sound a whole lot like blatant money laundering. \n \n \"I'm not comfortable with this,\" Cipriani said. \n \n Here is where Cipriani says he got his first glimpse of what U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy described, in the wake of Hanson's indictment, as the \"extreme threats of violence employed by the O-Dog Enterprise.\" A whiff of casual menace creeping into his voice, Hanson mentioned that he knew where Cipriani lived in Santa Monica. \n \n \"You have a beautiful wife,\" Hanson added, mentioning Greice. \"You're going to do this, you understand?\" \n \n As Cipriani relates it, he had no option but to go through with the plan. He claims he didn't know the extent of what Hanson was up to \u2013 the gambling business, the drugs, all that would trickle out later \u2013 but he felt he was in legitimate danger. So once again he took the money and cashed it into chips in the \"cage\" at the Star Casino, only this time with a caveat that he kept to himself. Rather than playing \"shortstop\" out on the floor, he decided to put the whole affair \"in the hands of the gambling gods,\" as he puts it, betting the maximum limit on every hand he played. It was a rash decision with perilous results. The $2.5 million was gone in a matter of days. \n \n \"I'm like, 'Holy shit, I just lost all this guy's money!'\" Cipriani recalls. \"And, like I told the FBI, that's when everything hit the fan.\" \n \n \n \n THE RISE \n \n What possessed Owen Hanson, the product of a coastal enclave of Los Angeles known for its Republican politics and reliable surf breaks, a talented student-athlete at an iconic university, to morph himself into Junior DeLuca, an alleged kingpin so flamboyant he would entrust Cipriani, a gambler who turned a messiah complex into a carnival act, with $4 million in drug profits? It is maybe the most puzzling facet of the case \u2013 and one only Hanson can fully explain. But if he has a different version of what went down between him and Cipriani in Sydney, he isn't sharing it. Since his arrest last year, Hanson has been held without bail at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in San Diego, where as inmate number 50825-298, he is facing life in prison on multiple counts of racketeering, money laundering, operating an illegal gambling business and conspiring to distribute drugs. A trial date is currently set for next February. His lawyer, Mark Adams, who recently represented the leader of a Tijuana drug cartel tried in the U.S., says that at this point Hanson has no comment. \n \n Talk to those who knew him, those who investigated him, as well as a number of people currently indicted in his scheme, however, and you begin to understand Hanson's criminal evolution as the byproduct of his most dominant traits: the competitive impulses, the aspirational streak of a middle class kid raised in proximity to tantalizing opulence, the belief that whatever he had was never quite enough. His upbringing in Redondo Beach was modest \u2013 divorced parents, a younger sister \u2013 especially in comparison to neighboring towns like Santa Monica and Laguna Beach. His father, who now lives in a $1.5 million home in Montana, where friends say Hanson joined him on occasional fishing trips, was a property maintenance manager for over 30 years. At Redondo Union High School, Hanson played basketball, ran cross country and was a force as an outside hitter on the volleyball squad. \n \n Related The Dukes of Oxy: How Teen Wrestlers Built a Smuggling Ring How a crew of hard-partying Florida teens cashed in on an epidemic and built a multimillion-dollar OxyContin smuggling ring \n \n Charlie D'Agostino, a Los Angeles real estate developer, has known Hanson since he was 17, when he worked menial jobs on D'Agostino's construction sites. D'Agostino, whose firm 3Ten Development worked on Hanson's Redondo Beach estate, allows that he \"wasn't really surprised\" by the allegations against Hanson, describing him as ambitious to a fault. \"Some of it's probably true,\" he says, \"some is overblown.\" But he declines to go into detail given that he, too, is also under federal indictment, charged with collecting gambling and drug proceeds on Hanson's behalf. Denying the charges against him, D'Agostino says, \"I was the source of Owen not doing illegal things.\" \n \n \n \n Michael Lee, the architect who designed Hanson's home in Redondo Beach during the same period he was allegedly establishing himself as a criminal, was shocked when he heard about the arrest of his former client. \"You got the impression he was a wheeler-dealer type,\" says Lee. \"He was busy, a little bit rushed, always looking at his watch, but always pleasant. Generally speaking, people who are building homes are ambitious and successful. Some you find out are ruthless, but that wasn't Owen.\" \n \n You hear this sentiment from plenty of people who knew Hanson, or at least those who knew him only as a young real estate developer \u2013 that he was a prototypical bro among men, a flirt in the company of women, hardly vindictive. \n \n \"Was my buddy really living a double life?\" asks Jeremy Shockey, the former NFL star. \"I guess anything is possible, but I just can't fathom it.\" \n \n The two first met over a decade ago at a pool party in Las Vegas, says Shockey, whose Instagram feed is dotted with images of him and Hanson: raising margarita glasses, hanging with NBA star Kris Humphries, surrounded by a bevy of women at a concert. Shockey was introduced to his ex-wife through Hanson, when he brought her to a party Shockey threw on a yacht. The two spent significant time together in Costa Rica, where, as Shockey understood it, Hanson made his money building houses and running a legal gambling business, taking advantage of the nation's lax regulations. \"The guy I knew was just a savvy businessman,\" he says. \"Sure, he liked celebrities and hanging at clubs \u2013 free bottle service and free models and all that \u2013 but drugs? Maybe I'm just gullible, but I didn't pick up on any of that. He never once mentioned going to Australia.\" \n \n If there is a period where Hanson began to exhibit certain tendencies that would later draw the attention of law enforcement \u2013 a hunger for power, a lust for money, an obsession with status \u2013 it is during his years at USC, where he entered the Los Angeles of wealth and extravagance that was just out of reach growing up. There, aside from playing on a football squad where Snoop Dogg was a regular at practices, Hanson was a member of Beta Theta Pi, a fraternity that was banned from pledging on campus. They briefly reformed as an underground society known for throwing wild parties called the Stumpos Raiders \u2013 so named, according to rumors, because they were raided by an LAPD officer with the last name Stumpos. It was in this realm that Hanson appears to have emerged as \"O-Dog,\" the campus hustler who was boys with the school's athletic gods. \"If you wanted something you went to O-Dog,\" says someone familiar with the group. \"Coke, steroids, you name it.\" \n \n \n \n Craig Mitchelldyer/Icon SMI/Newscom \n \n After college, Hanson expanded his campus identity into the larger realm of Los Angeles. He was a member of the MountainGate Country Club, located in the foothills of the Santa Monica Mountains, where he developed a reputation for flaunting the wealth he attributed to his real estate savvy. \"The guy loved to gamble, and he gambled big,\" says a former golfing partner. \"A thousand a hole, five thousand a hole. If you went high, he went higher.\" \n \n While Hanson had a brush with the law as early as 2007 \u2013 an arrest in Orange County that has since been disposed \u2013 he cut his teeth as a bookie, according to the FBI. Gambling, of course, has long occupied murky legal terrain in the United States: against the law almost everywhere, yet so tacitly accepted as a pastime that bookies in Vegas regularly see their spreads incorporated into mainstream sports coverage. Serving those who happen not to live in Vegas (or prefer to bet against spreads that differ from those set in Vegas) are a variety of bookies operating outside of the law, fueling a shadow economy that is estimated to bring in between $80 and $380 billion in illegal wagers annually. \"We don't make a habit out of busting illegal gambling organizations,\" says Brett Fenoglio, one of the FBI agents who oversaw the investigation into Hanson. \"Technically, they're all over the place: Guys running small-time books at sports bars, buddies betting for fun. For us to get involved it needs to be more nefarious than friends betting on football games when they're out golfing.\" \n \n Hanson became part of something more nefarious, according to Fenoglio, when he linked up with an organization called Macho Sports, which in 2011 became the target of an F.B.I. investigation, also led by Fenoglio. Run by Jan and Erik Portocarrero, two brothers from the South Bay who sought shelter from the law by operating their business through servers in Lima, Peru, the ring thrived for over a decade, processing tens of millions in bets and building a loyal client base in Southern California. \"Macho was routinely taking wagers of $40,000 and $50,000,\" says Fenoglio. \"Not a lot of guys can do that.\" Macho also offered gamblers generous lines of credit, luring in customers much the way banks did before the housing crash. \"It's like giving a drug user free cocaine,\" says Fenoglio. \"These guys were preying on people with problems.\" While Macho paid its winners promptly, the group showed little mercy when losers failed to hold up their end of the bargain, employing an enforcer known as \"Lurch\" to intimidate, and sometimes rough up, those who went into debt. \n \n Far from being discreet, the Portocarrero brothers displayed their money in peculiar ways. Erik, an aspiring rapper, self-financed a lavishly produced video for a song called \"The Clam Eater\" in which he saunters through a sea of thong-clad women rapping, with unflinching earnestness, about his love of cunnilingus. (Sample lyric: \"I'm a clam eater, a bottom feeder/I use my tongue more than my peeter\"). \"That video basically tells you everything you need to know about the kind of guys these were,\" says Fenoglio. In 2013, the Portocarreros were arrested along with 16 others; nearly $14 million was forfeited. But, as is typical with gambling cases, Jan and Erik received relatively light sentences of 18 and 22 months. Though Fenoglio can't talk directly about the case against Hanson while it's being prosecuted, he says that Hanson's organization started as a subsidiary of Macho Sports. His website, betodog.com, was run from the same servers in Peru, and Hanson shared the brothers' predilections for both ostentation and menace. \"Owen was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the Portocarreros,\" says Fenoglio. \n \n Avoiding prosecution during the Macho takedown, Hanson appears to have stepped into the void left by the arrests of the Portocarreros, establishing himself as a force in the gambling underworld of Southern California. One self-described \"heavy gambler\" who placed bets on college and NFL games through Hanson describes him in larger-than-life terms. \"The guy was unlike anything we'd ever seen,\" says the gambler, referring to a crew of friends who also bet through O-Dog. \"He was like Leonardo DiCaprio after Titanic \u2013 boom, 'I'm huge, fuck you.' Most bookies, they're pretty gentlemanly. Contrary to what you see in the movies, they don't break your legs when you don't pay. They don't want the heat.\" Hanson, like the Portocarreros, seemed to crave it. \"He ran his gambling business like drug dealers run the drug business,\" the former customer explains. \"If you're short a little money they'll kill you \u2013 that's the attitude that he brought. It took all of us off guard. We are all educated pussy white dudes. We thought he was one of us, but he acted like an Italian gangster from Queens.\" \n \n When this gambler went into debt \u2013 \"close to $75,000,\" he says \u2013 he learned just how severe Hanson could be when it came to collecting. \"He enjoys fucking with people,\" says the gambler. \"The guy threatened me for years, calling at all hours. Honestly, I thought I was going to end up dead.\" \n \n Hanson's arrest, according to the gambler, didn't come as a surprise. \"We all knew it would burn out for him,\" he says. \"We were actually placing bets on when he'd get busted. The over/under was a year.\" \n \n THE FALL \n \n In Sydney, after Robert Cipriani blew through Hanson's $2.5 million, he spent a few days dodging Hanson's calls as he tried, and failed, to gamble his way out of the hole. Then one afternoon as he was walking through the Star Casino, he was cornered by Hanson. At his side stood an Australian that Cipriani would later learn was a man named Sean Carolan, reportedly a former cage fighter and racehorse trainer who was acting as Hanson's muscle. After Cipriani explained that he'd lost the money, showing proof in the form of a win/loss statement from the casino, he says Hanson and Carolan became irate. \n \n As someone who describes his life as a series of improbable encounters with questionable individuals, Cipriani had traveled to Australia with what he terms an \"insurance policy\" \u2013 in this case, a reporter for Fox News named Rick Leventhal. Leventhal had been the one, back in 2008, who anointed Cipriani the \"Sin City Savior\" in a segment for the channel \u2013 the only mainstream coverage, as it happens, that Cipriani has received for his Robin Hood endeavors. (He appeared on the network looking like a cartoon bandit: black sunglasses, black cap, black bandana over his face.) The two had forged a mutually beneficial relationship in the years since: Cipriani enjoyed the occasional plug on Fox News, legitimizing his Robin Hood persona, and Leventhal, it appears, enjoyed the perks (potential leads, brushes with B-list celebrities) that came with entering Cipriani's peculiar orbit. \n \n \n \n Now, as Hanson and Carolan demanded that Cipriani follow them back to the nearby Hilton to pick up the next installment of cash, Cipriani played his ace. \"I can't leave with you,\" he said. \"I got a guy from Fox News doing a story on me.\" \n \n This wasn't exactly true: Leventhal, according to Cipriani, was enjoying a lavish gambling vacation paid for by an occasional subject. But the specter of a journalist lurking about was enough to give Hanson and Carolan pause. They told Cipriani to meet them in a few hours, giving Cipriani time to concoct an exit strategy. \n \n \"So I'm frantically calling Rick, who's just been gambling and refuses to pick up his phone,\" recalls Cipriani. \"Finally, I get a hold of him and say, 'Get your shit and meet me at the Four Seasons.' He's like, 'Dude, I'm down 12 grand!' I say, 'I'll give you 12 grand!' He says, 'What happened?' I say, 'The reason why I fucking brought you happened.'\" (Leventhal turned down numerous requests to comment, but Cipriani provided flight and hotel records, as well as text messages between the two, corroborating Leventhal's presence in Sydney.) \n \n When Cipriani received a call from Carolan demanding that Cipriani meet in room 3026 of the nearby Hilton Hotel, Cipriani instead took a cab to the airport with Leventhal, calling Hilton security en route and reporting \u2013 anonymously, falsely \u2013 that there was man with a gun in room 3026. Though he wouldn't know it for years, at that moment he had planted the seeds for what would evolve into a sweeping international investigation. When the police arrived, they did not find a gun, but they did find Sean Carolan and a suitcase filled with $702,000 in Australian currency. (A curious sum, Cipriani points out, given that he says it was intended for him \u2013 a gambler who calls himself Robin Hood 702.) \n \n When asked by police about the money, Carolan reportedly claimed it belonged to an American businessman named Owen Hanson who had invested in Carolan's fledgling weight-loss business. This explanation sounded dubious to the authorities, who seized the money. As they began looking into the matter, a number of suspicious personalities came out of the woodwork, shedding light on the company Hanson was keeping in Australia. First, an ostentatious concert promoter named Andrew McManus (pasty, bloated, known for bringing Kiss and Fleetwood Mac to Australia) claimed the money was in fact his \u2013 the proceeds of a Lenny Kravitz concert that Hanson was helping him \"sneak\" into Australia from New Zealand. Then McManus changed his story, saying the money had been delivered to Hanson by Craig Haeusler, a mutual friend who happened to be a convicted drug kingpin in Australia, and who was reportedly giving it to Hanson to repay him for helping fund a ZZ Top concert. Haeusler, when interviewed, told authorities that he and Hanson bet on NFL games together in the U.S. In 2012, when Hanson was eventually questioned by Australian authorities via video-link from the Beverly Hills Police Department, he was not exactly coy on the subject of the mysterious cash, exhibiting the cocky manner that would later get him into trouble with an FBI undercover operative. \n \n \"Do you want me to tell you the full story of how basically this money was laundered?\" he allegedly asked agents, adding, as if to legitimize himself, \"I deal with a lot of professional athletes.\" \n \n Yet, if Hanson was concerned about being tied to the investigation in Australia, to say nothing of the one being conducted into the Macho Sports empire, he didn't show it back in America. His business continued to thrive with a reliance on threats and intimidation \u2013 much of it, according to court records, directed at Cipriani. First there were phone calls, dozens of them, demanding that he pay back the $2.5 million he lost. And then there were threats, subtle at first, and then increasingly chilling. Flowers were sent to Greice, Cipriani's wife. A man in a van \u2013 later identified as Jack Rissell, the enforcer referred to in the indictment as \"Animal\" \u2013 was often stationed outside Cipriani's Santa Monica home. \"Just lurking,\" says Cipriani, \"and scaring the shit out of me and my wife.\" \n \n In July of 2012, Cipriani flew to Costa Rica to discuss a payback plan with Hanson. It didn't go well. Cipriani got spooked when he noticed that the man Hanson sent to pick him up was carrying a gun, and left the country without meeting Hanson. \"It made me think,\" Cipriani says, \"that he was trying to whack me.\" Meanwhile, back in the States Hanson's threats were only becoming more disturbing. That fall, around the same time that Hanson was being questioned by Australian police, Cipriani received a photograph of his parents' graves in a cemetery outside of Philadelphia; the tombstones were splattered in blood red paint, and photoshopped into the image was one of Hanson himself, wearing a Mexican wrestling mask and holding a shovel, as if to imply that Cipriani would soon be joining his family if he failed to pay. A few months later, in January of 2013, Cipriani received a DVD in the mail from Hanson that contained gruesome footage of two men being beheaded with a machete and chainsaw. Included with the DVD was a message: \"If you don't pay us our money, this will happen to you.\" \n \n By then, through his own gumshoe detective work, Cipriani had discovered that Junior DeLuca was in fact Owen Hanson. He knew about his days at USC, his friendships with pro athletes. This time, he decided to contact the FBI's San Diego branch. They had reason to listen. The office had just finished their takedown of the Macho Sports empire, during which Hanson's name had popped up. At the time they figured him for a minor player, but now a new investigation, this one focused solely on Hanson, was opened. \n \n \"Is it not fucking crazy?\" says Cipriani. \"Had I not gone to the feds, this motherfucker would still be out there!\" \n \n OUT-HUSTLED \n \n On October 18th, 2016, Hanson's lawyers filed a pre-trial motion that suggests an effort to undermine the government's case by discrediting Cipriani as a witness. By highlighting Cipriani's own past brushes with the law \u2013 namely a 2006 conviction for insurance fraud that Cipriani chalks up to a complex family feud \u2013 the defense portrays Cipriani as an established charlatan with a history of exploiting others for financial gain. They imply, in no uncertain language, that Cipriani was not an unwitting mark in Hanson's scheme, but an active participant, questioning why Cipriani has so far avoided prosecution for the $1.5 million he successfully laundered through the Star Casino back in June of 2011. \"The inescapable fact is that Mr. Cipriani was an important, yet unindicted, member of the alleged conspiracy,\" the motion reads. \n \n It is a curious line of defense: one hustler conceding, in essence, that he was outwitted by another. Cipriani, with his insatiable hunger for attention and lofty vision of himself as a \"famed international gambler,\" may not be the most reliable narrator, but given that he recklessly blew through $2.5 million of Hanson's money a few weeks after he nearly gambled away $1.5 million on a stint in Vegas, neither does he seem to be the professional extortionist Hanson's lawyers suggest. More critically, while Cipriani became an improbable catalyst for a federal investigation, it is what the FBI subsequently discovered that constitutes the most convincing evidence for their case against Hanson. \n \n Remove Cipriani from the equation, for instance, and you still have Betodog.com, the sports betting site Hanson established as a subset of the Macho Sports regime. You have numerous text messages from Hanson, all post-dating his interactions with Cipriani, instructing various runners to collect and deliver gambling proceeds. You have his communications with Luke Fairfield, a San Diego accountant also under indictment, that suggest a variety of Breaking Bad-like schemes (shell companies, structured bank transactions) to avoid scrutiny of Hanson's finances. You have Hanson emailing Jack Rissell, the enforcer, in order to ask if a delinquent gambler in Minnesota was dealt with properly. \"I paid 2K for a smack down,\" the message, from 2013, reads, making it clear that Cipriani was not the only target of his wrath. You have at least $5 million scattered in bank accounts, and an IRS agent's conclusion, from analyzing only the books of three alleged bookies, that Hanson generated income of $323,179 in just three months in 2012, giving a sense of his operation's scope. \n \n While the investigation into Hanson began as an inquiry into illegal betting, it is in his alleged role as a drug dealer that he faces the most severe punishment. Here, too, the most damning evidence is disconnected from Cipriani. You have Hanson, caught on a wiretap in 2014, praising a \"new batch\" of GHB, a controlled sedative commonly referred to as \"liquid ecstasy,\" received by \"Tank,\" the nickname of Giovanni Brandolino, the dealer indicted in the scheme. \"Strong and makes me real horney [sic],\" Hanson noted in a text, and on November 17th, 2014 you have Hanson directing Brandolino to sell cocaine and ecstasy to \"a current professional player then located in Nashville, Tennessee,\" a day the Titans played the Pittsburgh Steelers. You have him bragging to an undercover agent about how he sold kilograms of coke in Australia for $125,000, not to mention the five kilograms of cocaine and another five of methamphetamine that initially got him locked up. Rufus Rhone, who conducted that deal with an undercover agent, allegedly on Hanson's behalf, has already pleaded guilty; he is currently serving a sentence of six years. \n \n Meanwhile, in Australia, a number of arrests have been made in connection to the $702,000 found back in 2011, including those of Andrew McManus, the concert promoter, who in August pleaded guilty to perverting justice by lying about the money, avoiding the more serious charges of knowingly participating in a criminal group. His lawyer, Michael Croke, who also represented Hanson in Australia, has been arrested for his role. Most recently, in August, a 31-year-old Australian named Jonathan Fagan was charged with importing 88 kilos of cocaine from the United States between 2014 and 2015 as part of the same alleged syndicate. \n \n Dan Himbrechts/Redux \n \n Still, whether the case goes to trial in February or Hanson opts for a plea deal, questions hover at the edges of the affair. Was Hanson truly a cunning kingpin, as charged by the federal government? Or was he more of a wannabe Tony Soprano, a striving, status-seeking braggadocio undone by a terminal need to live a life that rivaled those of his former USC teammates turned professional football stars? As serious as the charges against him are, Hanson's \"organization\" seems ad-hoc at best, more a loose assemblage of desperate souls than a cartel of hardened career criminals. Take Rissell, who wouldn't comment on his alleged role as an enforcer; he currently works as a Ford salesman in Sacramento, and, according to an acquaintance, was living out of the van that Hanson paid him to park outside the home of Cipriani. Similarly, Daniel Portley-Hanks, the private investigator currently facing up to 10 years in prison for conducting background checks and coordinating threats for Hanson, remains confused over his current status. Seventy-years-old, overweight, diabetic and prone to breaking down in tears when talking about the case, he has worked for the FBI in the past, helping the agency take down, of all things, a bookmaking operation run by the Gambino crime family. \n \n \"I had no idea what this asshole was up to!\" Portley-Hanks says of Hanson, who, at least until Portley-Hanks's own arrest, he thought was a real estate developer who hired him to do routine background checks on business associates. \"We'd meet at a Starbucks on Wilshire Boulevard for Christ's sake,\" he goes on, adding that, as a licensed private eye, such work was legal. \"The guy paid me between $50 and $500 a pop over PayPal from a USC address. It didn't exactly scream criminal mastermind.\" Over a period of 38 months, Portley-Hanks was paid a total of $4,081.82 for his services. \"They're lumping me in as being part of some multi-million-dollar conspiracy, and I'm living in a one room apartment in Studio City on a fixed income?\" he says. \"Does that make sense to you?\" \n \n Portley-Hanks does admit that he helped Hanson with the photo of Cipriani's parents' graves splattered in paint. But, in his description, the whole thing was less the menacing \"threat\" as portrayed in the indictment than a collegiate prank concocted by an amped-up ex-frat brother with far too much time and money on his hands. \"Part of the reason I took that job, aside from being broke, is that my brother lived in New Jersey, about 50 miles from where Cipriani's parents are buried,\" he says. \"It was like a free trip to see my family.\" When he drove across the country, he claims, it was only to take a photo of the tombstones, for which Hanson paid him $5,000. \"Then, when I emailed it to Owen, he asks if I'll pour some red paint on it. Another $2,000. This was the day before Hurricane Sandy hit, so I'm thinking it will just wash away. But I mistakenly used waterproof paint when I meant to buy the water soluble stuff.\" \n \n Back in L.A., when he met Hanson at the Starbucks to receive his payment, Portley-Hanks says Hanson asked if he could be photo-shopped into the image for an additional fee. \"So we drive over to this park behind the La Brea Tar Pits, and he pulls a Mexican wrestling mask and a shovel out of the back of his car,\" Portley-Hanks recalls. \"All I'm thinking at that point is: This is one whacky motherfucker. But as a private eye you come across a lot of those. I figured the whole thing was two rich assholes playing games, like the kind of mindless threats that go back and forth over Twitter.\" \n \n Indeed, the most remarkable aspect to the case may be that Hanson's frat-boy antics and self-image as a Californian Pablo Escobar \u2013 manifesting in an unwavering obsession with hazing Cipriani and ultimately undercutting his otherwise shrewd approach to building a phenomenally lucrative illegal enterprise \u2013 is in the end the reason he sits in a prison cell today. Which is not to say that Cipriani has emerged from the feud untarnished. Though he wasn't indicted as a player in the laundering scheme \u2013 in part, he supposes, because of a proffer letter he signed with the Department of Justice before sharing information with F.B.I. \u2013 his association with Hanson has resulted in a lifetime ban from the casinos that once sent private jets for him. If he wants to play blackjack today, he must do so in \"two-bit Indian reservation casinos,\" putting his persona as Robin Hood into early retirement. \n \n \"I was the one who brought this motherfucker to justice, and this is what I get?\" he says.

The 35-year-old California man was sentenced to more than 21 years in prison Friday after pleading guilty to racketeering and conspiracy to distribute drugs, reports the Washington Post. His fall from grace is a wild tale: While at USC in 2004, Hanson began selling drugs, including cocaine and steroids, Rolling Stone previously reported. After college, he started working as a bookie in Los Angeles. Years later, his wife would tell a former boyfriend, professional gambler RJ Cipriani, that Hanson wanted to put up millions of dollars to fund his efforts at casinos in Australia, per 9 News. The money was to be returned with a casino check, though Cipriani could keep any winnings. Authorities say it was a scheme aimed at hiding money from Hanson's illegal dealings in Australia, where he could sell cocaine for ten times as much as in LA. Cipriani claims he figured this all out and was purposefully reckless at the casino tables to get out of the arrangement; he ended up losing $2.5 million. But his escape plan wasn't that easy. Cipriani says Hanson threatened him and his wife, including by sending them a video of two men being beheaded. \"If you don't pay us our money, this will happen to you,\" an attached note read, according to prosecutors. The US gambler eventually went to the FBI and Hanson was arrested in 2015 in a joint operation with Australian police. He pleaded guilty in January, and has now been ordered to forfeit $5 million in assets. More than 20 of Hanson's associates have also been charged with crimes related to gambling and drug trafficking.",

RJ Cipriani and his wife, Greice Santo, received the DVD from Owen Hanson, a 35-year-old Californian who pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy and conspiracy to distribute drugs and was sentenced to 21 years and three months in prison in a San Diego courtroom last week.

(Bill O\u2019Leary /The Washington Post) \n \n On the morning after Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, acting National Park Service director Michael T. Reynolds received an extraordinary summons: The new president wanted to talk to him. \n \n In a Saturday phone call, Trump personally ordered Reynolds to produce additional photographs of the previous day\u2019s crowds on the Mall, according to three individuals who have knowledge of the conversation. The president believed that the photos might prove that the media had lied in reporting that attendance had been no better than average. \n \n Trump also expressed anger over a retweet sent from the agency\u2019s account, in which side-by-side photographs showed far fewer people at his swearing-in than had shown up to see Barack Obama\u2019s inauguration in 2009. \n \n According to one account, Reynolds had been contacted by the White House and given a phone number to call. When he dialed it, he was told to hold for the president. \n \n For Trump, who sees himself and his achievements in superlative terms, the inauguration\u2019s crowd size has been a source of grievance that he appears unable to put behind him. It is a measure of his fixation on the issue that he would devote part of his first morning in office to it \u2014 and that he would take out his frustrations on an acting Park Service director. \n \n (The Washington Post) \n \n Word rapidly spread through the agency and Washington. The individuals who informed The Washington Post about the call did so on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the conversation. \n \n Neither Reynolds nor the Park Service would talk about it. \n \n \u201cThe National Park Service does not comment on internal conversations among administration officials,\u201d agency spokesman Thomas Crosson said. \n \n White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the call simply demonstrated that Trump\u2019s management style is to be \u201cso accessible, and constantly in touch.\u201d \n \n \u201cHe\u2019s not somebody who sits around and waits.

Experts, however, have estimated that the 2017 turnout was no more than a third the size of Obama\u2019s eight years earlier. \n \n Reynolds was taken aback by Trump\u2019s request, but he did secure some additional aerial photographs and forwarded them to the White House through normal channels in the Interior Department, the people who notified The Post said. The photos, however, did not prove Trump\u2019s contention that the crowd size was upward of 1 million. \n \n Reynolds, who had served as the Park Service\u2019s deputy director of operations for six months before assuming the post of acting director, is a third-generation employee who has worked there for more than 30 years. As deputy director, he oversaw the Park Service\u2019s $2.8 billion budget and more than 22,000 employees. \n \n In the days since Trump\u2019s election, the Park Service has become an unlikely protagonist in a battle between the new president and some career government employees. \n \n The trouble began late Friday, when the agency\u2019s official Twitter account retweeted two messages that could be perceived as critical of the new administration: the one comparing the relative crowd size for Trump\u2019s inauguration to that of Obama\u2019s 2009 swearing-in, and another that noted policy pages that had been removed from the White House\u2019s website. \n \n That prompted an \u201curgent directive\u201d to Interior employees that they \u201cshut down Twitter platforms immediately until further notice,\u201d which was lifted early Saturday morning. Crosson then apologized on Twitter for \u201cmistaken RTs from our account.\u201d \n \n On Tuesday, the Badlands National Park\u2019s Twitter account became a social-media sensation when it posted four tweets in a row about rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and the threats posed by climate change. \n \n Those tweets were then deleted. An NPS official later explained that Badlands NPS officials learned they were posted by a former employee who still had access to the account, and decided to remove them. \n \n [Interior Department reactivates Twitter accounts after shutdown following inauguration] \n \n Spicer told reporters this week that White House officials had not dictated any agency to impose new restrictions on public communications and that some federal officials, such as those at the Park Service, were not in compliance with their own department\u2019s policies. \n \n Trump, meanwhile, has continued to press the argument that the media has given a misleading account of the crowds that attended his inauguration. \n \n \u201cI had a massive amount of people here,\u201d the president told ABC News anchor David Muir in an interview Wednesday. \u201cThey were showing pictures that were very unflattering, as unflattering \u2014 from certain angles \u2014 that were taken early and lots of other things.\u201d \n \n As he guided Muir through the West Wing, Trump paused at a photo on the wall, taken from behind him as he delivered his inaugural address: \u201cHere\u2019s a picture of the event.

    "document": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif., left, accompanied by Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nev., speaks to reporters outside the West Wing of the White House in Washington, Thursday, Sept.... (Associated Press) \n \n WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Seeking to avert a government shutdown, Republican leaders drove a bill blocking Planned Parenthood's federal funds through the House on Friday, hoping to contain conservatives' demands for a politically risky showdown with President Barack Obama by striking a quick blow against abortion. \n \n The nearly party-line 241-187 vote followed a no-holds-barred debate that included a graphic, poster-sized photo of a scarred, aborted fetus and underscored how abortion has resurfaced as a white-hot political issue. The battle has been rejoined just in time for the 2016 election campaign and next week's historic address to Congress by Pope Francis. \n \n The issue's re-emergence followed the release of secretly recorded videos of Planned Parenthood officials offhandedly discussing how they sometimes procure tissue from aborted fetuses for medical research. \n \n \"What does it say about this Congress that today we're here on the House floor debating the killing and harvesting of aborted babies?\" said Rep. Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind. \"How can there possibly be two sides to this?\" \n \n But Democrats said the true GOP goal was to whip up conservative voters with legislation that would make it harder for women to get health care. Planned Parenthood, whose clinics provide sexual disease tests, contraception and abortion, says it's done nothing illegal and is being victimized by misleadingly edited videos. \n \n \"Enough is enough,\" said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., who chairs the Democratic National Committee. \"Some of their members are willing to risk women's lives just to score political points.\" \n \n Planned Parenthood gets around $450 million yearly in federal payments, mostly Medicaid reimbursements for handling low-income patients. That's around one-third of the organization's $1.3 billion annual budget. Practically none of the federal money can be used for abortions. \n \n Beyond Friday's bill, some conservatives want to attach language halting Planned Parenthood's payments to broader legislation financing government agencies, which otherwise run out of money next Thursday. Those Republicans say a government shutdown fight would at least produce a veto battle that would show voters where Republicans stand. \n \n House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, a long-time abortion foe, and virtually all House Republicans favor halting the flow of federal dollars to Planned Parenthood. But Boehner and other GOP leaders say a shutdown battle would be fruitless because they lack enough votes to prevail in the Senate or overcome an Obama veto. They also say voters oppose a shutdown and would punish the GOP in next year's elections if one occurred. \n \n Long unhappy with Boehner and other GOP leaders for not being confrontational enough, some in his party have threatened to force a House vote on removing him from his post if he backs down on this or other upcoming fights over federal borrowing and spending. \n \n The legislation that was voted on Friday, proposed by Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn., would end federal payments to Planned Parenthood for a year, diverting the money to thousands of community health centers. Republicans say those clinics could handle the displaced Planned Parenthood patients, but Democrats say the centers are overburdened and sometimes distant. \n \n Pressure from conservatives may ultimately force leaders to let Congress vote anyway on a bill that would avert a shutdown only if Planned Parenthood's federal dollars were stopped, a measure certain to die in the Senate. Once defeated, that would likely be followed by a measure temporarily financing government, perhaps into December, that would include Planned Parenthood funds and buy time to resolve disputes over spending, abortion and other issues. \n \n For now, Republican leaders are hoping that investigations by four congressional committees and other anti-abortion bills will relieve some of the pressure. \n \n Along those lines, the House voted 248-177 Friday for another measure, this one by Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., that would impose penalties of up to five years in prison plus fines on doctors who don't try to save infants born alive during abortions. \n \n And the Senate set a vote for Tuesday on a measure banning most late-term abortions, a bill that Democrats were poised to scuttle. Both of those bills also would face likely Senate defeat and an Obama veto threat. \n \n In Friday's House debate, both sides showed they had plenty of steam on the issue. \n \n Franks, who brought the fetus poster to the floor, said Congress' response to the Planned Parenthood videos \"is vital to everything those lying out in Arlington Cemetery died to save.\" \n \n And House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., asked, \"In the face of these videos, with all the alternatives women have for health, why would you want to force your constituents to pay for something so evil?\" \n \n Firing back, Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., said Republicans' were relying on deceptively edited videos and had \"manufactured a witch hunt.\" Added Rep. Sam Farr, D-Calif., \"Stop being so mean. Solve problems, do not create them.\" ||||| The same Republicans who campaigned on doing away with legislative crises are careening toward government shutdown in less than two weeks with still no concrete plan to stop it. \n \n It\u2019s not that Speaker John Boehner\u2019s (R-Ohio) leadership team is hiding their best hand. They have no trick up their sleeve, no ace in the hole \u2014 pick your clich\u00e9. Nearly everyone in House and Senate leadership recognizes a simple reality: At some point in the next two weeks, they will move on a bill free of provisions to strip Planned Parenthood of its government funding. It just depends how long it takes, how painful it is and whether Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s (R-Ky.) team stumbles into their second government shutdown in three years. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Twelve days remain until the government runs out of money, but the House and Senate are scheduled to be in session for just a fraction of that time. The showdown over Planned Parenthood is the epitome of crisis-fueled legislating. Senior Republican lawmakers and aides increasingly believe that the funding fight will come down to three-day dash \u2013 Sept. 28 through Sept. 30, the final day of the fiscal year. \n \n Asked Wednesday when his colleagues would get a glimpse at his bill to fund the government, Boehner said, \u201cAt some point.\u201d \n \n Several House Republicans lawmakers said they don't expect to vote before the week of Sept. 30. The House is only scheduled to be in session three days that week before the government runs out of money. \n \n To top it off, the endgame will almost certainly result in a referendum on Boehner\u2019s speakership. He's favored, but not guaranteed, to survive. But if he does it will be in a further weakened state. \n \n The path the funding fight will take is not yet clear to either Boehner or McConnell, according to senior aides to both men. But it\u2019s shaping up to be extraordinarily messy. \n \n Top aides to McConnell and Boehner have been in close contact, discussing who will move first to pass a funding bill in their chamber. But the House has been paralyzed with indecision. A pack of House Republicans \u2013 mostly on Steve Scalise\u2019s (R-La.) whip team \u2013 are worried about the expectations that will be set by passing a funding bill that strips funding from Planned Parenthood, only to relent in the end. Yet other forces in the conference want a vote on such a continuing resolution \u2013 and it\u2019s possible, yet hardly certain, that GOP leadership will set one up for next week. \n \n House Republicans want to be first to move a funding bill, but McConnell is setting up his own process \u2013 a sign of how slow the House has been to take action. \n \n McConnell is nearly certain to bring up a so-called CR to fund the government next week that includes the language to defund Planned Parenthood, but Democrats will block its consideration. McConnell will then move a funding bill free of legislative riders. Republican leaders believe conservatives, like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) will block it, but McConnell will be able to send it to the House by Sept. 29 at the latest. The Senate's plan could be put on hold if the House gets its act togther, aides caution. \n \n The House is also trying to send other anti-abortion measures to Obama\u2019s desk and are considering standalone bills, including one to defund Planned Parenthood that would ride alongside the government funding bill, but not impede its passage in the Senate. If the House hasn\u2019t passed a \"clean\" bill by Sept. 29, it will have one day to avoid a government shutdown by passing the Senate\u2019s bill, or a comparable measure. \n \n \u201cAt some point in time you have to face reality,\u201d said Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho), a member of the Appropriations Committee who is close to Boehner, speaking about the need to pass a clean bill. \u201cPeople say, \u2018Oh, you didn't even try to do x.\u2019 There are some things you can't do. We tried to repeal Obamacare 50-some odd times in the House and guess what? It didn't work. We probably should have figured that out after two or three.\u201d \n \n House Republican leaders, meanwhile, are working behind the scenes to try to calm the troops. McCarthy and Scalise have privately told Republicans that they will try to use the majority-vote reconciliation process to deny funding to the women\u2019s health group \u2014 they say that is the best way to get a bill to President Barack Obama's desk. GOP leaders have urged anti-abortion groups to speak out against a shutdown. \n \n At a closed party-wide meeting at the Capitol Hill Club on Thursday morning, GOP leaders presented lawmakers with an internal National Republican Congressional Committee poll showing overwhelming public opposition to shutting down the government to stop funding Planned Parenthood. The poll, conducted in 18 swing districts by the GOP firm The Tarrance Group, showed 64 percent of respondents would not favor a shutdown to try to stop the organization\u2019s federal funding, compared to 30 percent who favor shutting the government. Among those who had seen videos allegedly showing Planned Parenthood officials discussing fetal tissue sales, 55 percent did not favor a shutdown, while 37 percent thought it was the right move. \n \n \u201cWe want to be more strategic because I think we are on more solid ground right now than we have before in raising these issues,\u201d Rep. John Shimkus said (R-Ill.), who has a long record opposing abortion rights. \u201cBut there are some that say, 'Not a penny.' So, leadership is trying to work it out.\u201d \n \n While much of this fight is about the government\u2019s purported support of abortion, there\u2019s a hefty anti-Boehner sentiment that\u2019s spurring the opposition to the leadership\u2019s plans. After Congress clears a clean government-funding bill, Boehner and McCarthy aides expect a hard-line conservative to put forward a motion that would, if successful, force the Ohio Republican from the speaker\u2019s chair. \n \n Republican leaders do not expect the so-called motion to vacate, first filed by North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows, to succeed. They say they would handily defeat it if it came to the floor. \"Team Boehner,\" as it is called internally, is not actively preparing for the vote by whipping support in the GOP conference. \n \n But some of his allies privately say they have informally secured assurances from Democrats that they would support keeping Boehner as speaker, or vote present, which would lower the vote threshold. If all Democrats voted present, Boehner could win with as few as 124 Republicans. Recently, Boehner has even told some Republicans privately he would like to run for another term as speaker. \n \n Those looking to oust Boehner have not put forward an alternative to serve as speaker, and senior GOP leadership aides say the hardliners have no alternative for when the Senate and president reject their plan to defund Planned Parenthood. For example, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) said Florida Rep. Daniel Webster could be the next speaker because he got \u201c12 times as many votes as Kevin McCarthy.\u201d McCarthy did not campaign for the job earlier this year. Webster garnered 12 votes total. \n \n \u201cThe Sept. 30 crisis is a crisis of our leadership's making,\u201d Massie said. \u201cThey refuse to pass appropriations bills. Even the CR is not the way the government is supposed to be run. The American public knows that. What we need to do is get back to regular order.\u201d \n \n --John Bresnahan contributed to this report \n \n \n \n Authors: ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Republicans pushed bills targeting Planned Parenthood and curbing some abortion procedures toward House passage Friday, with party leaders hoping the legislation will help mollify fractious conservatives demanding a face-off with President Barack Obama that could trigger a federal shutdown. \n \n Republican presidential candidate, Sen.

(Associated Press) \n \n House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif., left, accompanied by Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nev., speaks to reporters outside the West Wing of the White House in Washington, Thursday, Sept.... (Associated Press) \n \n Neither measure has much chance of becoming law, since Democrats have the votes to block them in the Senate and the White House has threatened vetoes. But Republicans pushed ahead anyway, citing secretly recorded videos showing Planned Parenthood officials casually describing how they provide researchers with tissue from aborted fetuses. \n \n One of the measures would block Planned Parenthood's federal funds for a year, while the other would inflict criminal penalties on doctors who don't try saving infants born alive during abortions. As Friday's debate raged, it underscored how the fight over abortion could affect next year's elections. It's an emotional hotspot among each side's most loyal partisans and could be pivotal as each party seeks female voters. \n \n Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., sponsor of the bill imposing criminal penalties on doctors, defended his legislation as he stood beside a poster-sized photo of a scarred, aborted fetus that survived. \n \n \"Our response as a people and a nation to these horrors shown in these videos is vital to everything those lying out in Arlington Cemetery died to save,\" Franks said. \n \n Democrats said Franks' measure was unneeded because clinicians allowing born-alive babies to die would face murder charges. They said the GOP legislation had other goals. \n \n \"It's real intent is to further undermine a woman's right to choose,\" said Rep. Judy Chu, D-Calif. \n \n The anti-abortion activists who secretly recorded the videos say they show that Planned Parenthood is illegally profiting from organ sales. The organization says it's broken no laws and is being maligned by deceitfully edited recordings. \n \n The White House, in a statement released Thursday evening, said Obama called the shutdown threat \"a game of chicken with our economy that we cannot accept.\" \n \n It was unclear if House approval of the two bills would help House Speaker John Boehner solve a political Rubik's Cube. The Ohio Republican's twin goals: avoiding a shutdown fight that GOP leaders warn would set voters against the party, while simultaneously appeasing conservatives who might try to oust him as leader for not adequately confronting Obama. \n \n \"Our leaders wave the white flag every time there's a confrontation,\" said Rep. Mark Salmon, R-Ariz. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., said Boehner wants to \"implement what the lobbyists want, not what the constituents of our district want.\" \n \n At a closed meeting Thursday among House Republicans, leaders unveiled internal polling that attendees said showed most people would oppose a government shutdown \u2014 even those who have seen the videos and oppose financing Planned Parenthood. \n \n Many Republicans argued that the polling showed a shutdown fight would be damaging and unwinnable, especially since Senate Democrats already derailed a bill erasing Planned Parenthood's federal funds. \n \n \"Pounding on the table doesn't turn 54 into 60 in the Senate,\" said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., referring to the number of GOP senators and the number it would take to end Democratic filibusters. \n \n The bill by Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn., would transfer Planned Parenthood's federal money to thousands of government-backed community health centers. Supporters say that would keep women's health care intact, but opponents say those centers are overwhelmed and often far from women who need them. \n \n Planned Parenthood gets around $450 million yearly in federal payments, mostly Medicaid reimbursements for handling low-income patients, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. That's around one-third of the $1.3 billion yearly budget for the organization, which has nearly 700 clinics and provides sexual disease testing, contraceptives and abortions. \n \n Conservatives' determination to block Planned Parenthood's money has been partly fueled by the race for the GOP's presidential nomination. Several candidates used their Wednesday night debate to urge lawmakers to turn off that funding spigot. \n \n But spotlighting GOP divisions, Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., wrote Thursday to Sen.

Demands from House conservatives that even a short-term continuing resolution (CR) funding the government block money for Planned Parenthood. \n \n \u201cThe three of us agree that we want a short-term CR,\u201d Reid told reporters after the 90-minute huddle in the Oval Office. \u201cWe want to make sure the riders are off that, we want to make sure the government will be running.\u201d \n \n The top Democrats sought to present a united front in the contentious budget battle, even as Reid and Pelosi extended an olive branch to their Republican counterparts, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and Speaker John Boehner (Ohio), to sit down and hammer out a comprehensive budget agreement. \n \n Reid said that he is prepared \u201cto do something meaningful with spending\u201d on a broader funding deal after the short-term measure is passed. But he would not reveal how much additional spending he wants. \n \n Pelosi stressed that she wants spending talks to proceed in a \u201ctimely fashion\u201d so Congress can tackle other pressing issues, such as highway funding and a reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s important for us \u2026 to have not a very long CR, but one that enables us to have the time for the appropriators to write an omnibus bill,\u201d she said. \u201cThe sooner we can agree on a number under which we can write the appropriations bill, the sooner we can get this job done and address some of the other issues.\u201d \n \n Boehner and Pelosi met on Thursday to discuss a government funding bill, aides said. The meeting, which was first reported by Politico, lasted for about 20 minutes. \n \n Pelosi's lieutenant, Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), on Wednesday said Democrats had \"no idea\" how Republicans were going to avoid a shutdown because they hadn't been included in the discussions. \n \n Democrats have been demanding negotiations on next year\u2019s spending levels with Republicans, who are dealing with an internal rift over Planned Parenthood. \n \n After the release of a series of undercover videos that showed Planned Parenthood officials discussing the sale of fetal tissue, conservative Republicans have insisted federal money for the organization must be turned off. \n \n McConnell has warned against a standoff over the issue, arguing it would hurt the GOP brand just as the 2013 shutdown over ObamaCare damaged the party. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re going to fund the government,\u201d McConnell told reporters Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to shut the government down and we will do that hopefully into late fall.\u201d \n \n But the Senate\u2019s No. 2 Republican, John Cornyn (Texas), said Thursday the Senate will at least vote on a defunding measure in relation to a government funding measure. \n \n In the House, Republican leaders are trying to convince the rank and file it would be unwise to risk a shutdown over defunding the organization. \n \n During a closed-door meeting Thursday, leaders showed members polling data indicating Republicans would be blamed if the government shuts down. \n \n Reid agreed that Republicans would bare the brunt of the damage. The Democratic leader said the GOP took control of the Senate last year in spite of, and not because of, the shutdown in 2013. \n \n \u201cThey know what happened last time,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know they got a gift.\u201d \n \n If a short-term deal can be worked out, Congress will still have to work out the terms for a longer funding plan that would last through the next fiscal year. \n \n Democrats are demanding that any final deal lifts spending ceilings on defense and non-defense spending. Some Republicans are open to increasing the ceilings for defense, but most want to avoid any hike to non-defense spending. \n \n Peter Sullivan contributed. This story was last updated at 6:29 p.m. ||||| The U.S. House of Representatives voted Friday, Sept.18 to defund Planned Parenthood for a one-year period. The vote was 241-187, with nearly all Republicans and two Democrats supporting the legislation. (Reuters) \n \n This story has been updated. \n \n The House passed two abortion-related bills Friday, including one that would strip federal health-care funding from Planned Parenthood for one year, but it remains unclear whether the votes would appease conservatives who have threatened a government shutdown over the organization. \n \n The votes followed months of intense focus on Planned Parenthood prompted by undercover videos released by an activist group claiming they show violations of federal laws prohibiting the sales of fetal tissue for profit and restricting certain abortion procedures. Planned Parenthood has denied any wrongdoing and claimed the videos have been unfairly manipulated as it has fought off attempts to end its federal support. \n \n But neither bill is likely to become law as Senate Democrats have filibustered similar measures, and President Obama has indicated he would veto both bills. \n \n That\u2019s why the move is unlikely to stave off growing fears of a government shutdown on Oct. 1. Since House conservatives know the bill to defund Planned Parenthood is unlikely to be enacted, they\u2019re unlikely to back off their desire to attach it to a must-pass government spending measure to keep the government open. But again, neither Senate Democrats nor Obama will accept such language, triggering the standoff. \n \n Nonetheless, House Republicans hoped to appease conservatives with the abortion-related votes. \n \n One bill passed Friday, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, would impose criminal penalties on medical personnel who fail to aid an infant born after an attempted abortion. The other, the Defund Planned Parenthood Act, imposes a one-year moratorium on federal funding for the group, which Republicans say will allow for a thorough investigation of its practices. Any funding, supporters said, would be redirected to clinics that do not offer abortions. \n \n Congress must pass a budget before Sept. 30, or it faces partially shutting down the government for the second time in two years. Here's how we got to another potential shutdown. (Jayne W. Orenstein/The Washington Post) \n \n [Wary of shutdown, GOP leaders try to refocus abortion debate] \n \n \u201cMost people think that is common sense,\u201d said Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.), sponsor of the defunding bill. \u201cIf there is reason to investigate, then there is reason to withhold taxpayer dollars during that period of time. The American taxpayer has been clear for a very long time that they do not want federal funds spent on abortion.\u201d \n \n Democrats pointed out that Planned Parenthood has long been prohibited from spending federal money on abortions, thanks to appropriations riders dating back to the 1970s. And in a floor debate Friday, they called the bill an attack on women\u2019s health care and noted that other health-care providers would be unable to absorb all of Planned Parenthood\u2019s hundreds of thousands of patients. \n \n \u201cThis bill is dumb, it\u2019s foolish, and it\u2019s mean-spirited,\u201d said Rep. Lois Frankel (D-Fla.). \u201cThe bill is based upon lies and exaggerations. If you want to have a truthful debate, then let\u2019s talk about the 400,000 Pap smears, the 500,000 breast exams, the 4.5 million STD and HIV tests that Planned Parenthood does each year.\u201d \n \n [Sign up for The Daily 202, The Washington Post\u2019s new political tipsheet] \n \n Planned Parenthood\u2019s affiliated clinics are together the country\u2019s largest provider of abortions. But they also perform other women\u2019s health and family planning services, which are funded through Medicaid and Title X federal grants totaling about $450 million a year. \n \n The organization decried the vote Friday. \u201cThese bills are a callous attempt to insert politics into women\u2019s health, and we\u2019re grateful that the Senate and the president will stop them from becoming law,\u201d said Eric Ferrero, a spokesman for the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. \n \n Republicans and Democrats sparred over the undercover videos, which have been released by the Center for Medical Progress over the course of the summer. Rep. Kathy Castor (D-Fla.) called them part of a \u201ccoordinated, broad-based smear campaign full of distortions and misinformation.\u201d Key context was edited out of the videos, she said, including footage of exculpatory comments from Planned Parenthood executives. \n \n During the second round of GOP debates, Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina said \"shame on us\" if lawmakers don't stop a bill from passing that funds Planned Parenthood. (CNN) \n \n But Republicans said the videos spoke for themselves and lambasted Democrats for trying to undermine their content: \u201cIf they want to send one taxpayer dime to Planned Parenthood after watching them, shame on them,\u201d said Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Tex.). \n \n The votes broke down mostly along party lines, with the Planned Parenthood bill passing 241 to 187 and the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act passing 248 to 177. \n \n While public attention has been focused on the Planned Parenthood bill, anti-abortion activists believe the vote on the survivor protection bill, sponsored by Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), could be even more politically significant in the long run. \n \n Democrats say current law is already sufficient to prevent the abuses that activists fear, and they pointed to objections from medical groups, such as the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which said the bill represents \u201cgross legislative interference into the practice of medicine.\u201d But activists believe those opponents have assumed an extreme position that could become a liability in future campaigns. \n \n \u201cThe votes this afternoon are evidence of just how wedded to the idea of abortion on-demand, at any time, for any reason, that the Democratic Party has become,\u201d said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, noting only five of 188 Democrats voted in favor. \u201cWhere is the compassion and concern for \u2018the little guy,\u2019 the abortion survivor, whose heart is beating and alive?\u201d \n \n The bills were brought to the House floor amid in order to create leverage with President Obama and congressional Democrats given the nearing deadline to fund the government. But neither have indicated a shutdown would force them to blink. \n \n The Senate took an August test vote on a Planned Parenthood defunding bill, which fell well short of the 60 votes necessary to advance controversial legislation. Senators are expected to take a procedural vote Tuesday on a bill banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy in a related effort to demonstrate the political hurdles facing any bill restricting abortion rights. \n \n On the House side, GOP leaders have sought to tamp down demands to link Planned Parenthood funding to the spending deadline. They have made both political and practical arguments: In a Thursday morning meeting at Republican National Committee headquarters, party leaders presented polling numbers showing Republicans would be blamed for a shutdown in key battleground districts. And they told members that due to the vagaries of federal appropriations and funding cycles, the kind of short-term funding bill that is likely to pass ahead of the Sept. 30 deadline would do little to affect Planned Parenthood. \n \n \u201cIn the short term, you might feel better, but the money\u2019s already out the door,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), an Appropriations Committee member and leadership ally. \u201cLet\u2019s do the hearings. Let\u2019s find out what the case is. Let\u2019s try to craft something that\u2019s a little more nuanced and precise than just, \u2018if you don\u2019t do what we want, we\u2019ll shut down the government.\u2019 \u201c",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Twelve days remain in the fiscal year, and the threat of a second government shutdown in three years remains very much in play. The big problem remains a showdown over funding for Planned Parenthood, with conservative Republicans who are upset about recent undercover videos demanding that the group lose all federal funds. With the clock ticking, party leaders still have \"no concrete plan\" to avoid the shutdown, reports Politico. One possibility is to pass a temporary measure before the end of the month to allow more time for negotiations in the fall, but that's not a slam dunk\u2014because House conservatives demand that even such a continuing resolution block Planned Parenthood funding, reports the Hill. They're also threatening to try to oust John Boehner\u2014who opposes abortion and Planned Parenthood but doesn't want to hand Democrats a potential gift in the form of a shutdown\u2014as speaker if he backs down. The AP sees a possible way out of what it calls this \"political Rubik's Cube.\" House leaders are pushing through a number of abortion-related measures, including one that passed today to defund Planned Parenthood for a year. The measures stand virtually no chance of becoming law, but leaders hope they will be enough to mollify the conservative rank-and-file. It \"remains unclear\" whether that will be the case, however, notes the Washington Post. Lawmakers are in session only five more days until the deadline, and about the only safe bet is that the drama will go down to the final day, if not hour.",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Seeking to avert a government shutdown, Republican leaders drove a bill blocking Planned Parenthood's federal funds through the House on Friday, hoping to contain conservatives' demands for a politically risky showdown with President Obama by striking a quick blow against abortion. The nearly party-line 241-187 vote followed a no-holds-barred debate that included a graphic, poster-sized photo of a scarred, aborted fetus and underscored how abortion has resurfaced as a white-hot political issue. The issue's re-emergence followed the release of secretly recorded videos of Planned Parenthood officials offhandedly discussing how they sometimes procure tissue from aborted fetuses for medical research. \"What does it say about this Congress that today we're here on the House floor debating the killing and harvesting of aborted babies?\" said Rep. Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind. \"How can there possibly be two sides to this?\" But Democrats said the true GOP goal was to whip up conservative voters with legislation that would make it harder for women to get health care. Planned Parenthood, whose clinics provide sexual disease tests, contraception, and abortion, says it's done nothing illegal and is being victimized by misleadingly edited videos. \"Enough is enough,\" said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who chairs the Democratic National Committee. \"Some of their members are willing to risk women's lives just to score political points.\" Planned Parenthood gets around $450 million yearly in federal payments, mostly Medicaid reimbursements for handling low-income patients. Practically none of the federal money can be used for abortions. Beyond Friday's vote, some conservatives want to attach language halting Planned Parenthood's payments.",
